236311,0,t3_1wrmhh,I would like it but I must add it must be done for the PC not a shitty console port.  I have played plenty.  Halo PC is still one of my most played games daily  I would like to note the reason why is because of the fact it wasnt Bungie doing it  percent Gearbox Studios helped with the port and it was awesome.  You gotta realize that i probably really have experience in making PC style game I know they released Spartan Assault but that is only  game which wasnt a fps.Other hand I dont have any expectation of that actually happening.  It would be nice though.  Plus it would make them a ton of money which people love in big businesses.  Only reason why I say it probably wont happen is because it will be a High Risk to make a PC port that is actually decent but that also would probably take some money to be able to do a decent one.  Or they could just bullshit the fanbase into buying it like what Infinity Ward did with Mw PC and the rest of the CoD series afterwards.  Been wanting to buy the current CoD games for PC but from what I have read online it is pretty shitty and the companies that are suppose to be fixing it arent.You also have to realize another factor.  i would actually have to release PC patches and help ban people if they dont allow Server Admins to customize it and have access to be able to ban people.  I love the current Halo PC servers setup but I dont think that would happen unless they did what Valve did with TF. They have a Matchmaking system and a Server browser system that literally works for the most part.  I like their system and if i some how was able to copy that style of system put a Halo style spin to it making it super cool and futuristic I would be pleased.The point Im trying to make is.  If i wants to actually impress people with a PC edition of Halo  or past Halo games they need to do actual research and study how past PC games are still being played even though people seem to think they are dead.  They need to simply ask the community what they would want also and actually show a step by step plan on how they are going to do this and actually do it.  They also need to actually take the time and make sure it is made for PC not just a console port to PC it would literally please and make hundreds if not thousands of PC gamers orgasm.  I would love to see Halo go on the PC again and be successful like it is on the Xbox but I want them to do it in a smart way and make tons of money vs a shot in the dark with a shitty ass piece of shit console port that they just dump on your front lawn and never look at again.,halo,cf58rqt,0,t5_2qixk

236924,0,t3_1wso0z,The events of Spartan Ops take place six months after Halo s campaign. Infinity returns to Requiem where Covenant insurgentsled by Jul Mdama who styles himself as the Didacts Handand Prometheans are still active.Sarah Palmer commander of the SpartanIVs deploys Spartan squads to clear out the Covenant and Promethean forces in Requiems interior in order to set up research bases. Crimson Squad recovers a mysterious artifact excavated by Covenant Infinity scientist Doctor Glassman disappears after studying the device.Catherine Halsey is brought to Infinity due to her knowledge of Forerunner technology. She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne who lost his family during the Didacts attack on New Phoenix. While studying the artifact Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous sender. The source of the transmissions is Mdama who captures Glassman and forces him to work on a Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Pursuing Mdamas troops Crimson Squad recovers another artifact. When Halsey examines the device it displays images Thorne recognizes as depicting New Phoenix. Lasky reveals to Halsey and the Spartans that the UNSC knows Prometheans are former humans. Approaching the artifact looking for answers Thorne is teleported to Requiem and captured by Covenant. Palmer arrests Halsey for communicating with Mdama. Thorne escapes captivity outside Mdamas base and escapes with Glassman they are rescued by Majestic Squad.Halsey uses an override code to force Infinitys AI Roland to assist her. Seeking information withheld from her concerning the Librarian Halsey learns that Master Chief is alive. Halsey contacts Mdama to try and strike a deal as they both want to find the Librarian Roland breaks free of Halseys control and summons guards to apprehend Halsey. Lasky decides to place Halsey in cryogenic sleep to prevent further trouble but Promethean forces invade Infinity capture Halsey and teleport her to Mdamas base. Serin Osman head of the Office of Naval Intelligence ONI orders Lasky to kill Halsey however he is reluctant to do it. Palmer sets off to Requiem to kill Halsey Lasky tells Majestic Squad to intervene and rescue Halsey from Mdama.Halsey steps into the Forerunner device and makes contact with the Librarian. The Librarian gives Halsey the two pieces of the Janus Key an instrument that provides the location for all Forerunner technology in the galaxy Librarian instructs Halsey to use the key to advance humankind. Upon receiving the key Halsey exits the device and Mdama takes half of the key from her. Halsey passes the second piece to Thorne as Majestic Squad and Palmer arrive. Palmer wounds Halsey in the arm just before a Promethean teleports Mdama and Halsey from the base. Mdama sets Requiem to collide with the nearby sun and his forces evacuate the planet.Crimson and Majestic disable devices that anchor Infinity to Requiem allowing the ship to escape before the installation is destroyed. Meanwhile Halsey who lost her wounded arm tells Mdama she has been betrayed by the UNSC and offers to ally herself to exact revenge.,halo,cf5b28u,3,t5_2qixk

308594,0,t1_cfcd6zv,Since you asked so nicely I mocked up in pseudo code what would be a reasonable example of course their actual code will be orders of magnitude more complicated. Some assumptions we know that in H you could mess with certain settings that the game engine would have to be able to read health was tweakable along with movement speed my example just implements a third setting Glitches On. I even bolded the changes they could add to toggle glitching. Apparently you cant bold in code so instead Ive just added comments. I hope this makes you see this is very possible and not particularly difficult.  This example illustrates Double Firing simply add a DoMelee function with similar implementation for BXR. Disclaimer I probably got the architecture of halo completely wrong Ive never seen their code. But hopefully you dont get too hung up on that.    class Engine             ...         Map mapCur         ...            class Spartan        ...    int iCooldown    bool fReloading        ...                 class Map        ...    int iHealthPercentage         New Configurable Setting    bool fGlitch    int iMovementSpeedPercentage    ...            void EngineDoShotSpartan sparCur        if sparCurgtAmmo          DoReloadsparCur    return                 New check added that would not allow you to fire if you havent finished reloading         in my example the async DrawReload would set fReloading to fFalse. The glitch         or more accurately the bug that causes this behavior is that we only checked cooldown         without checking if we were actively reloading. Simple oversight and simple resolution if         we want it    if sparCurgtiCooldown !  || thisgtmapCurgtfGlitch ?? fFalse  sparCurgtfReloading    return        CaclulateHitsparCurgtaimDirectionX sparCurgtaimDirectionY sparcurgtaimDirectionZ    sparCurgtiCooldwon  sparCurgtCurGunCooldown        async DrawShotsparCurgtaimDirectionX sparCurgtaimDirectionY sparcurgtaimDirectionZ        void EngineDoReloadSpartan sparCur        if sparCurgtAmmo  sparCurgtCurWeaponMaxAmmo    return         sparCurgtiCooldown      sparcurgtfReloading  fTrue         async DrawReloadsparCur        void LaunchGame             Added a fourth parameter to the constructor    Map map  new MapsettingsgtmapEnum settingsgthealthPercentage settingsgtmovementPercentage settingsgtfGlitching    Engine engine  new Enginemap    enginegtStartGame         void EngineIdle         ...    for int i   i lt playerCount i        if SpartansigtiCooldown gt      SpartansigtiCooldown        ...    ,halo,cfcr4y5,2,t5_2qixk

What Im saying is on a soldier vs soldier basis the IIs are a lot more hardcore than the IVs. That being said the IIs only really function as their own groups or solo effectively. Its hard to add them to an existing unit to compliment it since theyre just so far beyond the skillset of your average marine platoon. The marines would honestly just slow them down.IVs on the other hand having already had regular service under their belt have a shared comeraderie with the other UNSC troops that the IIs never had I guess less of an us and them mindset than the IIs would have.

363927,0,t1_cfidmo6,You specified that Spartans run as fact and implied the game wouldnt be good would be dumb if they didnt. This implies that a game is good not dumb if they run if sprint is included. This is equating hat sprint more realism makes the gameplay better by not being dumb. This is vastly wrong. Look at it like this. What would happen if we took unreal tournament  seen as the almost perfect incarnation of an arena shooter we added sprint to it. That game would be busted. But people in an arena would run right so it just be good because its more realistic? Arena combatants run get over it? No. It would be a vastly different game because it plays vastly different. Sprint has a huge impact on map design they have to be open spacious and expansive or players feel cramped and this is hard to design around considering vehicles foot soldiers and close combat fighting. I believe this is why the heavies playlist in h was so successful. Yes it had sprint but it closed the gap for players with vehicles nicely played weapons and every encounter was usually deadly for one combatant with little time to sprint away. Sprints purpose is to let players move around the map more to find weapons vehicles or other players. If its not used as an escape method then why cant you disable it and make the maps a bit smaller? Sand trap on halo  was basically perfectly sized yet huge for vehicles. ,halo,cfihj27,0,t5_2qixk

584849,0,t1_cg6o5rs,I see what youre saying but I think Halo should stick to what it knows FPS. I would much rather i focus on producing highquality FPS games primarily. Im cool with nonmain series FPS games as you mentioned with ODST but I think Halo belongs in one genre of games. Basically if you play it I want it to be an FPS. Books movies shows comics sex toys those things are all cool with me. But keep the games FPS. Thats my opinion. EDIT To be fair I have never played both Halo Wars or Spartan Assault. I know their plots because I just need to but I cant actually speak to their quality. Maybe theyre good! But those genres arent for me.,halo,cg6r2e3,3,t5_2qixk

Make the forerunner weapons look and feel superior but also make sure they have a place in Halo with balance so the weapons are good in certain situations.Also this was a big thing for me but bring back the old plasma rifle. It was so iconic. I know it wasnt the best weapon but the storm rifle is just a covenant assault rifle and I didnt really like that. The plasma rifle wasnt used in the same way the storm rifle is. I also think reintroducing past weapons like the plasma rifle or say the Maulers could bring back dual wielding.

620587,0,t1_cgadwm3,Ive been throwing this idea around a few threads here but tell me what you thinkTitanfallesque use of NPCs in PvP multiplayer to create large battles reminiscent of the big campaign setpieces that I think Halo does so well. This would not be in place of regular multiplayer. If anything it might replace Firefight or something but I would not want it to erase traditional Halo MP. Something like v Spartans vs Elites with  Grunts amp Jackals on the Cove side and  Marines amp ODSTs on the UNSC side. It would allow for hectic large scale fights without gamebreaking numbers of players in the game. For instance you said you want full Warthogs. Me too! Just fill one with Marines instead and ride into the fight. Same goes for a Falcon. Taking it one step further imagine Forging such games. So many possibilities! Ive been playing Titanfall lately my brother just got it and its currently the only game I have available to me due to my current living situation and while Im enjoying it a lot I feel like its very onenote. Halo has such a rich world with so many various NPC types I feel like NPCinfused multiplayer battles would be amazing in it and awesome battles would emerge out of the interplay between all those NPCs plus players interacting in one match. Just a thought.EDIT Also bring back Invasion. Please please please. Maybe even... Dominion too?,halo,cgat817,1,t5_2qixk

I feel this somewhat balances it a bit and makes using sprint to get around on small maps more risky. It lets you adapt to when you should sprint and when you shouldnt.That said I do think sprint greatly unbalances the game and ruins the quality of maps.,halo,cgc4g4c,0,t5_2qixk

Couple this with the fact that the maps are less total bullshit and out to get you than ODST Chasm Ten in particular is purely for masochists with its spawns and you get a Firefight experience that is easier overall than ODSTs though any wave featuring elites is measurably harder than their ODST brute counterparts,halo,cgg679v,1,t5_2qixk

703694,0,t1_cgk8wz6,Take the guns as an example.With little exception and only minor changes every UNSC gun used in any game or extendeduniverse story could be produced now and would be quite effective as a military weapon. Only a few aspects of them computational sights recoil dispersion and ammunition counters are in prototypical stages currently. And we could probably make ammunition counters now but the cost outweighs the benefit.Many aspects of the various armors used by the UNSC while not able to be produced now are still based on science and methods that we understand now but lack the funding and some technologies to produce.Even Covenant and Forerunner weapons make sense in a logical aspect. Why make plasma weapons? Aside from shooting degree gases at your enemy as if that wasnt awesome enough imagine the morale of a unit taking cover in something flammable. A wooden house or a dry forest for example. Concentrate plasma fire on it and you essentially have a longrange flamethrower.The games are not realistic that much is obvious but the lore and EU stories often portray a much more realistic universe than that which is shown. Its a theory of mine that the games show a video gameized version of events that would have taken place in a more realistic manner firefights at hundreds of meters not tens shields breaking after one or two shots not four or more Chief not wiping out  Covenant or whatever the number is supposed to be maybe closer to .,halo,cgk9gs1,4,t5_2qixk

Batman could not master every martial art because he is too young to even have the time to do that.Also Captain America and Batman are superhuman.

Previous Halos are filled with interesting encounters and situations for example Halo CEs AOTCR didnt really have any clear objectives other than just find the control room. Youre put in a position where you have no idea whats going on and you simply have to explore your way to the control room. However the level was extremely varied in what you could do and ways to approach each situation. You could take the banshee early on and fly through the level use the tank use a warthog to blitz through it go on foot use the various camos lying around etc. Another good example is Halo s scarab fights which are no doubt some of the coolest things in the series. Halo s campaign just felt dull and predictable to me and didnt really bring anything new to the table other than flying the pelican which they nailed perfectly and was actually really fun.,halo,cgmx7ps,1,t5_2qixk

Outside of these he mostly showed indifference for the lives of others and he often abandoned positions of leadership to do his whole lone wolf thing.

1015374,1,t3_25pgxi,Gosh I hate this discussion. It has been discussed so many times. There are people on this sub that can break down why sprint is bad in a very informative and easy to understand way. It would take paragraphs to put into detail everything that sprint ruins in Halo.For a couple points on sprint in Halo I believe it ruins map flow. Yeah the maps in Halo  werent the best but besides that I think Halo used to have a certain majestic flow in the former titles. Your Spartan movements were very fluid and graceful instead of intense and out of control. IMO sprinting breaks gametypes without a radar because halo used to be a paced out shooter that involved map control and strategy. With sprint it sort of ruins that aspect. You get a lot of lone wolves in your matches and they are extremely hard to work with. Even I am guilty of doing it. I pick my loadouts with my favorite weapon and I go and do my own thing. Unless you have a premade team sprint ruins teamwork. There are a lot of reasons to me why sprint changes to much of Halo that I used to love but I wont be able to explain it as good as someone else. ,halo,chjpe9v,1,t5_2qixk

But lets be honest thats not going to happen either.Theres a fair bit of nostalgia effecting Halo . The majority of people havent touched Halo  in years and I can almost guarantee that it wouldnt do as well as the Halo  fans think it might.Also Halo CEA barely sold more than  million copies.

Those numbers dont make any sense. That means that in  days length of the battle of earth  of Earths population was killed or evacuated.

Add in the attack and a population of much less wouldnt be surprising. Who knows how many humans that wouldve been on Earth in the past are now living on a colony world or on a ship etc. Halseys population estimate was  billion in her journal and Ive heard that over  billion were killed in the Covenant War leaving us with  billion with an untold number of those living on colonies and places other than Earth.

1384503,0,t3_29y6fl,Ive got two.Shooter horror game taking place during Halo CE. Youre an ODST on the Pillar of Autumn. It starts with dropping into Halo. After a couple missions against the Covenant your team is ambushed by the Flood. You have to fight to survive against Covenant and Flood while trying to escape Halo. Combat would be mostly close quarters enemies would be very difficult to kill and there wouldnt be as many of them at once. If you wanted to use Covenant weapons they would have serious penalties like no reticle reduced accuracy and such. However they would be more effective against some targets. Second is a fire team based shooter where you play as a Marine starting before the Covenant invasion fighting the insurrectionists. Gameplay would need a cover system maybe iron sights or some sort of target reticle based in your helmet no shields or regenerating health Innies are not individually tough or smart but numerous Covvies are tough smart and numerous basically set up so you cant beat it alone. Your fire team would have  members  have ARs  has a DMR and the th has a SAW of some sort. Occasionally you may have a medic attached who can do healing and has an SMG. Youre stationed on a planet with a large innie presence and spend several missions patrolling and fighting them. While on patrol the Covenant invade the capital city and youre part of the counter attack. You have to complete objectives and the story progresses until the Covenant are clearly going to win and you have to cover the evacuation. Basically Reach from a Marines perspective.,halo,ciptwlh,2,t5_2qixk

I think itd be trivial to take out  just add in some code that makes the player wait until the animation is complete to allow them to do anything else  but this changes the game mechanics. It makes it so that people that played Halo  years ago when it was popular lose that edge that they used to have and instead of being a classic experience it becomes one that is tweaked just enough to make people miss what Halo  used to be.,halo,cir6oq9,0,t5_2qixk

1403799,0,t1_cirbh0l,Thats kinda not equitable though. Nor is the fact that button combos originated as a glitch which doesnt make much sense either way. Can you provide some sources for this? Im curious.Combos exist in fighting games because they are mirroring actual fighting. Boxing MMA and any body movements have used combinations. They also exist in extreme sports games because they are how a designer increases skill gap. FPSs are analogous to military warfare. There arent combinations in that nor does stacking melees or bullets sensible. They do damage based on placement amount interval maybe. The button glitches were never intended never reimplemented and could be argued that go against the VERY foundation of FPS mechanics. IE they remove focus from strategy situational awareness teamwork and to top it all off dont make any sense. It creates an overpowered microsecond kill with BXR or BXB which isnt counterable and presents an advantage to anyone that spends specific time practicing something that was never once intended for the game. Dont get me wrong they are skillful and challenging to pull off especially quad shot but they reward a skill focus that is based on aspects to the game never once introduced into FPSs. Interesting unique and a great case study but if I were creating an idealized competitive FPS environment everything would be intended and exploits nor glitches would have place in this environment. But Im glad there are two versions of Halo . It does suck feeling coerced into using the glitches but in reality you cant not not use them when skilled players are and it feels odd not using them against average players since you have those untapped potential. Ill see how it goes but I hope to not use them until someone uses one on me. Kinda like crouch humping in that way. cents,halo,cis8vqa,1,t5_2qixk

Also while playing the more popular game modes I never had a chance to use any of the loadouts I spent time customizing I feel the only reason people dislike the game so much is because it didnt add anything people actually wanted.

Dare I say lame. I liked the myriad of choices but they kinda all didnt feel like they had any gravity to them. Im also partial to the unlock system in Reach. Credits. Nothing but credits.

That would be the way for the ultimate super soldier to go out. During the final battle for the survival of our species Chiefs helmet gets ripped off. Underneath is a pale aged face covered in scars with no sign of fear. A soldier hardened by decades of war. The exact opposite of the  year old child Dr. Halsey met in Elysium City. Chief primes a sticky and holds it between himself and his enemy. The almost hollow look that this solider gives his enemy during those final moments creates the most horrific fear his enemy has ever felt.,halo,cjfquqs,4,t5_2qixk

1724547,0,t3_2e5401,The Halo  pistol is unbalanced because of its context the sandbox that surrounds it. Its perfect for  of all situations and makes half of the sandbox not worth touching. When balancing an item in a sandbox its important to ask yourself whether you could stand to make it a little more powerful or a little weaker. If you could stand it going in either direction then its a fairly balanced weapon. Could you honestly say you wouldnt mind having the pistol be a little more powerful?Removing the scope giving the pistol a kick and adding a contrail to the projectile is an effective approach to balancing it however its still a very effective utility weapon close to the OP side of the scale. If it was balanced to begin with it would not still be able to hold the title of strongest utility weapon after such nerfs yet it does.,halo,cjwjkvb,-10,t5_2qixk

1735485,0,t3_2ebia7,I would say the Spartan IIs and here is why. Genetic Superiority Dr. Halsey specifically chose the IIs for among other things their genetics. The qualifications to be a III were a lot less strict.. Armour Superiority If I recall from Ghosts of Onyx the SPI armor could take maybe  or  hits from a plasma rifle before the wearer is killed. Compared to the Mark  MJOLNIR that could take between  and  shots. The IIs are much better equipped armour wise.. Function of IIs Spartan IIs were initially created to fight the Innies and be the best soldier they could be. The IIIs on the other hand were made as a sort of disposable Spartan as seen in Operation TORPEDO They had far greater training than a typical Marine but didnt have the level of training a II would have because ONI figured they would likely be killed.Please correct me if I made any mistakes in lore Im doing this mostly from the knowledge I got in my noggin.,halo,cjxx7ht,15,t5_2qixk

1852675,0,t1_ckcfkpx,Because Halo is not the military dipshit. Hitler didnt own the army you are quite literally saying that someones creation a story is on par with the fucking Holocaust. And if you want to continue this Ill play. Your argument is that the Didacts intentions werent clear enough in Halo  that it caused confusion for players. Okay sounds good. But then you go on to say that its not the same thing as knowing where Master Chief is. First of all No. If youre gonna bring up scriptwriting classes you should know that setting and motivation are just as important as having clear motives for the antagonist. We got more information in Halo  about what the Didact wanted to do that how Chief magically went from being on a single person spaceship with no faster than light travel to fucking planet Earth Let alone why Sgt. Johnson was miraculously saved. You go on to complain about the fact that additional details of Halo s stories were present in optional Terminals in the fucking game. And its not like finding the skulls in Halo  You just had to look a little bit harder than your typical kill everything until its dead then shoot some more playthrough. This goes back to my original point If someone wants to know more about the story the information is all there. It takes a little effort. It doesnt matter what your opinion on the story is Halo  has its faults but its pretty well accepted that it was one of if not the outright best campaigns in the Halo series. Just because you couldnt be halfassed enough to learn why the Didact wanted to kill humanity doesnt matter Then the story isnt for you. Spoilers buddy If you didnt like Halo s method of giving information about the universe you are just gonna hate the rest of the Halo series since thats the route theyre going to take for the rest of the series.Long story short No not all stories are the same. An interactive one as large and as expansive as Halo isnt going to have the same stipulations and rules as the Expendables movies. In addition comparing i making changes to a video game franchise to Hitler condemning millions of people is not only buttfuck retarded its also incredibly offensive. And finally Your opinion doesnt suddenly make it a bad story. Nor does you taking a college level intro to film class make you an expert on storytelling. The game sold millions I think they know what theyre doing. ,halo,ckcfy2u,2,t5_2qixk

I kept telling my friends about this cool new vehicle and how it has a shotgun on the front. Im glad they decided to put it back in game. It made driving the mongoose super fun.    Edit just realized that this gungoose has a machine gun mounted. The one I played had a shotgun with unlimited ammo.

Sadly not a lot of people are on a fair amount but... and it makes getting into some games pretty hard.

The mod features the human United Nations Space Command and the alien hegemony The Covenant along with some Forerunner flair here and there. Gameplay focuses on fast paced fleet combat utilizing sophisticated tactics and long term strategy to beat your opponent or survive invasions from the parasitic Flood.gtThe mod is available at  for free and the game SoaSE Rebellion is available on Steam  While the DLC is not necessary it is supported by the mod and you are missing out on interesting gameplay by not getting it.If you have any specific questions Im more than happy to answer them.,halo,ckyp2pq,1,t5_2qixk
2044313,0,t3_2i7k5k,My brother and I collected the Halo  figures for ages. They were some of our favorite toys but this guy is right on the money. They had A LOT of problems. Macfarlane redeemed themselves for the Halo Reach line thankfully.The toys felt much sturdier. This is because they were bulkier a good representation of the Halo Reach models. This limited the articulation slightly but the legs benefited greatly. They toys themselves felt less epic in the paintjob department but they had far less errors. That said all of the non spartan figures needed work. The elites were even harder to pose sadly. But having more stable toys was worth it.The Halo  line was sad though. Not a large selection at all. The toys were still good though! I think the figures blended the Halo  paint jobs with the halo Reach sturdiness and articulation. The torsos were a bit weird but that was manageable. I believe the reason the Halo  toys suffered was because the hype was gone. A lot of other companies were getting the license and were doing great things with it. I grabbed a few play arts kai figures they have many complaints from me though mainly the legs and I have Master Chief and Palmer Sprukits on my desk right now. Personally I find the Spru Kits to be the best toys Theyre fun to build and have an insane level of articulation. Im looking forward to the new Chief coming out at the larger scale. Now in order to get the best toys possible you have to detail these spru kits but its not that hard.Ill write reviews for all of this actually. Time to get my own soapbox.,halo,ckzoe5r,13,t5_2qixk

2295756,0,t3_2ljvh8,At launch there is only one ranked playlist. This is because the ranking system they are using is new. They even said rank might be reset if it needs to. Heregt As youve heard the ranking system lives at the playlist level meaning that youll have an independent skillbased rank for each ranked playlist. We also modified matchmaking to use new skill detection which will put players into the fairest matches faster than any Halo game to date.gtAdditionally we built Halo The Master Chief Collections ranking system to emulate the exact Halo style leveling but it is a system that has been built from the ground up. This is the first time weve built a Matchmaking and ranking system that will work across multiple games and as a result well be rolling out ranking for each playlist postlaunch and will launch with one ranked playlist Team Halo  Anniversary. As time goes on well be rolling out the official ranked version for each ranked playlist. For example the Halo  and Halo  playlists will not be ranked immediately at launch however they will still have skill matchmaking underneath to ensure balanced matches but will each receive ranked play postlaunch. As this is a new system custom built for this game we do expect some players to make every effort to exploit the system and will be agile in issuing fixes and updates. Additionally if needed we will reset ranks after launch to ensure that all players ranks are fair consistent and accurate. Well provide more details on ranking and the playlist ranking rollout in the near future.Source,halo,clvgzdn,17,t5_2qixk

Great selection of power weapons and good sightlines around the map.

2322242,0,t1_clyq1qf,gtIm aware of all that but you were making the point that grenades become useless with sprint. Oh but now youre arguing that theyre less effective with sprint. Keep your argument consistent.That was the first reply Ive made to you I think youre mistaking me for the other poster.gtYeah sprint is very helpful for defensive play. So? Is there anything wrong with more defensive options other than it interrupts the gameplay flow? Or in other words it isnt classic Halo.Its subjective obviously. Im not saying its an invalid design approach but A I personally find it less enjoyable and B it is less conducive to the type of competitive play associated with Halo since it slows down the game and rewards passivity more.I mean what exactly is your point here? Im not saying games like this shouldnt be made Id just rather Halo didnt turn in to one and dont really see any reason for it to do so. Its not like this is some objectively better element its just a different style of gameplay but one that is already quite widespread in the market. You just seem to be arguing in favour of change for changes sake.,halo,clyqr8h,1,t5_2qixk

Sprint as a feature has simply not worked in Halo and I just cant see how you can refute this.

However as much as I love the old games Im welcoming the changes.  I think each game has evolved just enough.  They cant keep putting out the same game with higher resolution and frame rate.  If thats truly all anyone wanted then the MCC is all anyone needs.  This is a great step in the right direction AND this is only the beta.  This is a full YEAR ahead of time where we can give feedback.  I dont think there was anything wrong with Reach or Halo .  Reach was actually the most fun I had had since playing Halo  on xbox live for the first time.

2351818,0,t1_cm2dyi4,Im not basing this discussion simply on the current matchmaking issues. Im talking about being lied constantly by the gaming industry about having dedicated servers and then finding out the developer has implemented a contingencyhybrid PP dedicated server structure which allow them to claim to have dedicated servers but then choose at their whim to turn them off based on cost or whatever other reason they choose to.  Gears of War did this and the same thing has happened with CoD AW.  Its unacceptable.Properly supported games with dedicated servers should never have a need for a PP backup system. Ever. Wait until  decides that keeping the servers up isnt cost effective and turn most of them off and then your primary games are in PP matches.  Thats not what I paid for. The only reason I bought this game was because they said they will be on dedicated servers. Period. ,halo,cm2e8r4,-2,t5_2qixk

2415074,0,t3_2n49fo,They actually didnt survive the Halos firing in the forerunner war. What happened was that the ring you found in Halo  had flood on it. The flood got released because the covenant was fucking about and accidently released them. The flood actually still existed on some rings as research by the forerunners like the rings in  and . So the flood certainly could still exsist on other constructs and with the new games having an intense focus on the forerunners and discovering their old tech i think it is likely the flood could come back. For all we know there could be another ring with more flood just waiting to be released.Tldr the forerunners preserved the flood on some rings for research meaning there could be more out there. So it all depends if  wants to bring them back or not.,halo,cma7n7x,3,t5_2qixk

2417475,0,t1_cmai4wh,Actually its likely only  or so lines of code that handle mm. The engines are already written compartmentalizations and have an API. The problem is likely with moving to deviated servers dx and x optimizations and xbox one system calls. Moving from PowerPC original xbox and  to x can be daunting for code that is architecture specific. The other problem is I believe that developers did not coordinate versions well. The halo ce is the PC version for mp as well as halo  vista halo  pre title update and halo  prepatch. They did not update the games the game patches were deltas and not full commit patches. ,halo,cmaibib,3,t5_2qixk

2437472,0,t1_cmctiyr,I have to strongly disagree with you and weigh in here...Halo Multiplayer is something that never gets old. Every match is a little different and requires you to give a  to win especially when you are in higher ranks. The game is so much fun to play with teammates and to all work together to get a victory its addicting and quick and easy to play. Its even fun to dick around with friends in BTB Warthog flag capturing is hilarious and so much fun with friends. Want to hop on for  hour and play  games? Done. Its not like Destiny or WoW where you really need to commit time to raid and get better gear. So the game has a very low barrier to entry. Halo is what you make it and there will always be a very strong fan base to play online. You can still easily get games on Xbox  Halo  today!Also splitscreen. Most video games have moved away from split screen these days so Halo MCC would probably be like  of  games that has splitscreen for that type of genre on the X. Seriously thats huge because when you have friends over and you want to play a video game youre going to play MCC. No one wants to sit there and watch someone play Destiny or COD. After being around Halo for the past  years... all I can say isIf you build it they will come.,halo,cmcz6to,3,t5_2qixk

2441679,0,t3_2ngnjp,No at least not in any game that revolves around the Master Chief as the games protagonist. Halo has and always should be an arena shooter. You cannot balance an arena shooter around  players and  players at the same time not to mention it is such a massive move away from the playerbase that it would alienate people more than Halo s Multiplayer.That said I would love a battlefield type spinoff that does exactly what you are proposing. It would be really cool to have a game that is balanced and designed for more player than the traditional arena shooter that traditional Halo is. It would be really cool to be running around as a spartan or elite with AI grunts and marines fighting by your side ala Titanfall or Battlefront. ,halo,cmdhvli,2,t5_2qixk

2444378,0,t1_cmdtrno,ampampampSection . Breaking Quarantine of article  The Halo Graphic Novel sfw gtLike The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor Breaking Quarantine deals with the Flood outbreak that occurs during Halo. While The Last Voyage tells the story from the Covenant perspective Breaking Quarantine highlights the escape of the human soldier Sgt. Johnson from the Flood. Johnson is a minor personality in Halo Combat Evolved who becomes an important character in the following two games while the novel Halo First Strike explains that Johnson resists Flood infestation due to a medical condition no other story up to that point explained how Johnson escapes. Breaking Quarantine is an example of Bungies attempts to expand the story arcs of secondary characters that would have no opportunity to go explained in the main storyline. Unlike the other stories Breaking Quarantine contains no dialogue only weapon sound effects which are rendered in Japanese. Both art and story were provided by Tsutomu Nihei a manga artist and architect who based his illustrations directly on the structures found within the game. gtInteresting Flood Halo | Master Chief Halo | Halo Uprising | Lee Hammock Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmdtvi oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmdtvi.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the leveling in LoL and was fun reaching Gold.  I never thought I would enjoy a game like that until I played and had the same desire to place higher that I did when H came out.One thing I do remember about the interviews was once you hit the semipro tier you will be given an elo rating which is pretty much what LoL uses. Before you get to that tier idk how it is going to be.

2490331,0,t1_cmjm1ke,It seems logical to me that more games with the correct number of players and potentially with better balancing would yield better statistics than fewer games plagued with more problems.  These games are not indicative of what they will be running on the server when all is said and done so what is to be gained from keeping it broken?Youre right I cant possibly know that but it seems intuitive because the team creation and team balancing is clearly an issue.  Additionally its creating teams with more than  players.  Its not unreasonable to assume this shouldnt happen with or without disconnects.  If no one disconnects they should get a full game of  and they can make it v.  If people disconnect teams will be smaller or they will refill the games.

Are you not aware of the huge changes made from Halo CE to  to ? They are really big changes. The difference is that while those changes heavily changed the way the game plays they didnt touch the formula or general feel of the game. Dual wielding Removal of fall damage Hidden health bar that regenerates Revemped the melee system twice Plasma pistol EMP Rocket lock on Vehicle boarding Overhauled item spawn system EquipmentThose are just gameplay changes lets take a look at new features added Several new gametypes Forge Playable elites Armor customization Theater Skulls File sharing Massively expanded custom game optionsHalo CE through  steadily evolved both in terms of gameplay changes as well as innovative new features that didnt affect gameplay but the formula and core gameplay remained the same which is what kept it so popular. People liked Halo so they expect the sequels to follow the same design as the original. When you hear someone say that they want the old Halo formula they arent saying that they want Halo  again theyre saying that they want the same design philosophy from Halo   and . No game should ever change the design philosophy or overhaul the core of the game it should be built upon and complemented by adding new features or refining existing mechanics.,halo,cmjpzaj,7,t5_2qixk

2510301,0,t1_cmm7puv,I guess well have to agree to disagree. With Halo  I saw every twist coming and rolled my eyes at every line of dialogue. The characters were atrocious in my view I dont even remember most of them and I felt Chief and Cortana were totally overwritten saying more and saying things they would never say under Bungies pen. I felt nothing despite the fact that Cortana is one of my favourite characters in video games and the Halo series has some of my favourite writing in gaming.As for Reach  what can I say its one of my favourite games of all time. I thought Halo  was a complete mess and Reach conversely nearperfect. It was fully featured expertly designed beautifully to look at and listen to and the story was excellent  atmospheric well paced consistently surprising and had an incredible ending. Its perhaps the best script in the entire series simply for how tight and well rounded it is and it is absolutely the best designed campaign. I love that game so much.To each their own I guess.,halo,cmm8gfs,0,t5_2qixk

2511148,0,t1_cmmbxrq,He was always better than me. We had different play styles. We played halo together for about  years or so with around  games together. However the big difference was that I considered myself a bruiser he wasnt. He barely knew his way around melee in any capacity. Nothing but BR and sniper for him. Just quickly looking at these I had  combined melee  assassinations in  games . per game.Kenny had  combined across  games for . per game. Either way one thing was certain it just felt like we were cursed. We could carry most of the time but there was always just this question of how Bungies matchmaking could possibly this fucked up. I like to stick to the rather amusing suspicion that Jerimiah ninja On Fire who was a Bungie employee waaaaaay back in the day put a curse on me after I killed him one time in a custom game in halo . ,halo,cmmcg1n,5,t5_2qixk

Guilty Spark arrives at the mining station and begins to educate the heretic leader about the truth of the rings and how the prophets have used the Elites to do their bidding. Guilty Spark is doing this because he needs the human covenant war to end before the Humans are wiped out since the humans are the only beings that can activate the Halo Array. Spark and the Sentinels therefore must protect the heretic long enough for him to get his word out and end the Human Covenant War. Siding with the ArbiterCovenant would only prevent Spark from activating the rings since he needs a human hand to complete that task.   ,halo,cmmvf1v,4,t5_2qixk

2562816,0,t1_cmt37zp,No. Not really. Its called cascading advantage. Once one team has acquired one power weapon say rockets or sniper then it makes it easier to control and acquire other power weapons which is usually one or two more on the map at most. They only real counterargument to that is symmetrical spawn maps like Sanctuary Shrine or Pit where spawns are... well symmetrical. But even still in a BR start game you will be able to get them back in a better way. If one team has both snipers on either of those maps and you spawn with an ARSMG then you are how we say proper fucked.,halo,cmt3j6l,1,t5_2qixk

Geometry  I disagree I think more jump ups are needed honestly being stuck low constantly infuriates me having more jump ups are a infinitely good thingKOTH  Honestly Im eh on this its constantly scrappy time and doesnt really allow for set ups whether its maps  minute hill time Ive no idea but its annoying. Oddball  should be fixed first before added Gametypes  no thanks to  flag its awful. Maybe ricochet or neutral flag? but probably too similar to bomb. Maybe have it instead of bomb on sanctuary?no real problem with the weapons tbhPower ups are needed certainly a la construct and being stuck low. It will help pushes from lift maybe needed there.I think pros should dictate how the game goes I fully accept they have a better knowledge of the game than me. Its the same in sc the pros beta test maps and are listened too they are the ones who help keep the scene running they should be listened to and their experience taken on board. They are more reliable for feedback than randoms fans should be listened to but I tend to trust that pros know what their talking about better.

Then a few months later the next pack would come out and do the same thing.It was a great system I dont know why they got rid of it. Im pretty sure most people who were going to buy the DLC have done it after a certain point  really wouldnt lose much money giving them away.,halo,cmvrrzn,2,t5_2qixk

I find games online in the ranked playlist within  mins now and the dedicated servers are awesome but with the ranked situation being s being paired with s its still rather screwy.

Its a huge level with with tons of vehicle sections and the par time is  minutes which is strait up unachievable if you play the mission as intended. If you do the speedrunning path regardless of difficulty you will end up at around  minutes if you do things optimally. If your run is not optimized or you run into a death or  you might squeeze in just barely under the  minute mark. Really frustrating as part of the speedrun involves a very hard jetpack jump over a bottomless pit and if you miss youre set back about  minute to the previous checkpoint.,halo,cmxn9hy,2,t5_2qixk

From my experience every game has been pp its very clear with the lag amp host advantage this game like many others before it H H amp CoD seems to love to pick a host who cant handle all connections cause of insufficient inconsistent connection or upload speed to support being the host which leads to people ghosting back amp forth being bullet spongesshit hit detection andor killing everyone in seemingly  shots cause the host connection isnt properly talking to other connections telling it whats going on something a dedicated server SHOULD NOT have a problem doing unless the net code sucks hopefully not the case,halo,cn5djrv,1,t5_2qixk

2678924,0,t1_cn88guc,Sprint takes up a button forces wide open map design encourages running away is pointless and adds nothing of value. It simply serves no purpose aside from making movement more obnoxious and loud. What can you do with sprint that you cant do without it? Its completely fucking pointless. I never missed it back when I was playing H but I got used to it in Reach because it was in the MLG settings and once we started removing it in customs after realising it was broken I found myself annoyed not having a button to start running faster for a while but got over it and never missed it again after a week of accustoming to it. This annoyance is all the defenders of sprint have.Just the fact that every single poll has shown an absolute majority in opposition to sprint for the last  years is enough to make it a stupid addition to Halo . Seriously even on here  are against it  on Waypoint  on The Halo council and Beyond forums. What further support do I need for my case?,halo,cn898c4,-1,t5_2qixk

The power weapons give you a definite advantage which is good seeing thats what they are supposed to do. The weapons feel powerful especially the SMG and the Battle Rifle. The new maps feel pretty balanced and provide for some good fights. Ground pound is a bitch to pull off but thats alright and the Spartan Charge is awesome when you actually manage to kill someone with it.

2688201,0,t1_cn9eqvu,I believe it influences gameplay in a positive light simply because the meaning of power weapon increases with the weapons in this class. The extra movement speed and lunge to Prophets Bane make it very deadly on Truth because you now have a distinct advantage over other players outside of simply having x weapon that does y blast radius. It influences the actual movement mechanics and such. Once the opponent knows that you have it unless theyre fairly average players theyre going to start playing differently. Keeping back and spread out seems to be a reaction Ive noticed by many. That said at the same time Ive found it pretty difficult to use because on Truth people seem to always be traveling in groups and the TTK is damn low that Im likely to get a double kill at best when coming across a group unless the opponents aim is something out of this world horrid. ,halo,cn9guas,1,t5_2qixk

When without sprint if you are out of position or need to be in a position for a power weapon spawn but arent you get punished for it. In Halo  I can be across map from my team and easily sprint to them in seconds or sprint to a power weapon.In actuality Sprint lowers the skill curve allowing players to escape death and make plays they are no were near in position for.,halo,cn9t8mm,1,t5_2qixk

2695231,0,t3_2qx8m6,I have very few problems with the balance of this game so far when it comes to automatics.  For once theyre actually useable!Removing their ability to descope doesnt make much sense to me.  Yes theyre spammable weapons and you can get a good ping or two on a sniper and aid your own survival but they really hold no advantage over any midlong range weapon because a descoped BRs shots will still land where youre aiming where a descoped automatic will spray all over the place.  Unless youre very close range where an AR or SMG should win anyway otherwise theres no point in picking one up a skilled player with a BR will win every time.There are three nobrainer changes that should be and I believe will be made that will probably serve as extremely subtle nerfs to automatics that are along the lines of what you want.  Removal of flinch will make aiming with a precision weapon much easier especially when fighting an automatic confirmed to be changed before launch.  Speeding up the snipers smartscope animation will allow descoped snipers to recover faster nerfing longrange auto spam.  And the SMGs range when smartscoped should be toned down seriously the things a monster when scoped in.Beyond that I think automatics in this game are balanced fine relative to the other weapons.,halo,cnadw2n,1,t5_2qixk

And like you said it displays winddistance information.TLDROldzoom  camera on top of gunbarrel.

The early beta also helps i to make a game that are closer to what we the players want it to be like. And will probably help the reception when the game releases.

2750112,0,t1_cngni8i,Who said anything about the battlefield system? Have you ever played Halo PC? You can join a server host a game or set up your own server. In this scenario the third option would be to rent a  server from MS or .I said Halo needs a custom game browser. A custom game browser would allow you to view a list of currently available custom games that you can join. uImMufasa suggested the ability to rent  servers. Currently if you want to play a custom game you have to know people to play with and one of you has to set the game up on their Xbox. With a custom game browser you can see all currently running custom games that are set to public of course so if you want to play Fat Kid and everyone you know is busy you just look through the list for games of Fat Kid. Now the problem is if the person who started the game wants to go to bed or play a different Xbox One game the game has to end. To solve this people would have the option of renting  servers. Now you or someone else can rent a server set it up for Fat Kid and it is constantly running all the time. Whether the person who set it up is playing or not.Edit Typos,halo,cngocok,3,t5_2qixk

If the time comes where I actively cant agree with where the game is headed Ill just stop buying it and focus on other great games. The Gears of War franchise is a good example of this principle. Judgment was so horribly received due to the changes it made and ultimately undersold all other entries in the franchise.

2769113,0,t3_2rr3st,Adding sprint to Halo is like adding trampolines to basketball. At first it seems like a good idea to freshen things up add a new element to the game and attract some new players to the game. They would even be balanced because both teams get the same benefits from the trampolines. But there is a reason the NBA is infinitely more popular than Slamball and there is a reason the Halos without sprint were more popular than the ones with sprint. It is nothing more than a gimmick to attract players who are not very good at the base game. And if were being honest basketball with trampolines isnt really basketball anymore and Halo with sprint isnt really Halo anymore.If you like Halo with sprint good for you. If you dont like Halo without sprint good for you. The fact of the matter remains that Halo became a wildly successful competitive shooter with high population retention without sprint. It is now a wildly successful casual shooter with poor population retention with sprint. Halo  while being a decent game as a standalone title does not play nearly as well competitively as Halo    or Reach. If trampolines were added to basketball you could not feasibly expect great basketball players to accept the change simply because Slamball is still a fun game to play with your bros which I imagine it is. Competitive basketball players would absolutely have a right to be outraged at their game being bastardized into a shell of its former self. This is what the best Halo players are currently being forced to deal with. Professional players have explained why sprint does not work competitively in Halo and their concerns have fallen on deaf ears. It is incredibly disappointing to see what this game has turned into. It is not a good competitive game. If you are fine with that good for you but I respect your opinion just as much as someone who would prefer basketball be played with trampolines.,halo,cniu67c,2,t5_2qixk

2770347,0,t1_cniz2ar,I agree I dont think the automatic weapons are overpowered though I can see where people could argue that it takes more skill to be good with the BR than it does with automatic weapons. However I think it brings another element of skill to the game that was always kind of lacking  strategy. Im not saying there hasnt been strategy in the past Halos because there certainly was but now theres more consideration for what weapons you have and what situations can you handle. In the past it was more we all have BRs lets try to make a play. Now its we have X Y  and Z weapons we can run play A but play B is too risky with our weapon setup.In that sense it certainly is slower paced and more passive but I prefer it this way.

2788745,0,t1_cnkkand, They were actually separated far enough to where if a Wraith hit in between one of the open spaces there would be no splash damage to the surrounded Warthogs. They were also far apart enough that if they were hit no other vehicle nearby would be affected by the explosion. True they didnt fire and we have zero idea what the range on the Warthogs gun is or how accurate it is outside of gameplay. Not that it matters. The Banshees didnt fire a single bomb in the cutscene. They used cannons and didnt even hit anything with it. The Wraiths did all the damage. Also keep in mind that there was a Pelican in the fight behind the Warthogs along with a Falcon. I believe they actually succeeded in taking out  of the  Banshees because once you start playing only two remain to attack Kat. Alright. You win this one but the point wasnt to win that fight. It was to get to the bridge. Sure you could say that putting the Spartans on guns would help but a Spartan would obviously be the best driver there due to their reflexes. They would have a much higher chance at no crashing and avoided plasma fire which Kat did. The reason I say you win is because Noble  was just chilling in the passenger seat when heshe could have been on a gun or driving a completely separate Warthog to double the chances of a Spartan making it to a gun.As for your last point the huge force you see at the beginning is not the one that is with Noble  and Kat. They split off. Kat and Noble  only had  Mongoose  Pelican  Falcon and  Warthogs with them compared to the  Scorpions  Warthogs  Mongooses  Falcons and  Pelicans we see earlier. The majority of these guys left. As for why they couldnt have covertly placed a bomb on the AntiAir Canon I dont think they knew it was there. The thing you placed a bomb on the last level was a jammer. It blocked all UNSC scanning hiding everything the Covenant had in the area. Once they blew the jammer up all was revealed. What they did actually makes sense. Had they blown up the jammer immediately the Covenant would have had time to properly reinforce their AA guns with more troops since they would have to know they just lost a jammer and had their entire location scanned. Instead the UNSC stormed in and blew up the jammer revealing all and since the fight had all ready started it was now too late for the Covenant to properly reinforce the AA gun.Lets say they somehow knew of the Covenants AA gun early and covertly placed a bomb on it and detonated and proceeded to MAC the area. The Covenant had plenty of Corvettes there to destroy any UNSC ships trying to do just that. If they somehow got past the Corvettes I dont know if they would have even been able to break the shield. For all we know it could be impervious to attacks since it is clearly a concentrated shield barrier almost like a Jackal shield which is why we can actually see the shield. They usually are invisible. It may have been absolutely necessary to send infantry into the Spire to destroy from the inside.Lets assume they could take down the barrier and the Spire. Well congratulations The Long Night of Solace a Covenant Super Carrier that is ft longThe Infinity biggest UNSC ship so far is only ft just took out an entire UNSC fleet due to having its camouflage ruined. Point is the way they did it in the game is easily the best outcome.,halo,cnl2jx1,1,t5_2qixk

ARs require constant movement to be effective. You cant hold Pink Tower with an AR  because you wont actually be able to supply damage to the bases and Carbine  and more importantly your teammates in fights  with your lack of range. On a map with only one power weapon like Truth the team that gets the BRsDMRs  spawn trap is uncontested for the rest of the game. Even on a map with a ton of power weapons you arent going to ever get them. The team with the BRs is going to control those parts of the map fanatically. Also the TTKs are a result of sprint. Theyre needed to combat the fact that your opponent can turn tail and book it. And SMG starts are the devil Bungie even came out and apologized about them. ,halo,cnlasn9,2,t5_2qixk

2854511,0,t3_2sr5ds,The only way to fix it is either have AR starts for casualsocial playlists and have BR starts for ranked. Or have ARBR starts for all playlists in which you spawn with both.Personally Ive enjoyed BR starts for years since h for all the reasons listed. One PW control means that team runs away with it as the other cant do shit back. Case in point two games of AR starts on Orion and Pegasus today quite close we get one rotation of weapon spawns in both cases take a double digit kill lead in Pegasus it was  kills for one return in Orion . They were just stuck with no good weapons when we had everything and were just taking heads for fun. Its simply not competitive and leads to massive switches in play over one PW spawn or one set up. And AR starts leads to way more campy play as the BR is so powerful you get a few guys on your team with it and a sniper you win you dont need to move you just stay up high in a good position pink tower on midship remake or light rifle side on pegasus or hut on Orion or top mid on Eden and the AR spawning team cant do a single thing. yay insta win.Its simply not competitive and just removes anything fun about the game. Feel free to try and counter my points but I cant stand AR starts. ,halo,cnsk4ay,4,t5_2qixk

This could easily have been the title that put the Xbox One in so many living rooms that dominated the Xbox Live playing and they fucked it up. The sheer number of little things they did wrong are piled up so high that it will take them until November just to get everything working smoothly and the way that it should.

2883811,0,t1_cnvvlno,Im buying Halo  because its not in the same category. Its one game built from the ground up for XB versus porting  games from  systems Xbox PC Xbox  putting them to the Xbox One upressing them to  and then HA for Xbox One.  messed up we get it theres a lot of complexity in the coding there and shit just didnt work. Im not defending them it sucks we all get it. Regardless Halo  from the Beta is exactly what Id expect for a game built for the new generation. It runs well its smooth it plays well its very fun and I really didnt see many errors. So Im going to keep supporting  because I have faith in them. I dont know what happened but anybody with a moderate idea of coding would look at MCC and realize that it couldnt have been an easy task and things went to hell. Unfortunately trying to explain s errors in a logical light instead of burning them at the stake seems to just merit downvotes which is hilarious. This subreddit has gone to shit since MCC released with nonstop complaining. Im still having fun on the game and Im probably a month away from unsubbing from here if people keep bitching about the same things over and over. We know whats broken and as somebody said recently  picked all the low hanging fruit and now they have to find out what the error is in the  GB of content this game has and try to fix it. Its not going to be quick but when I go to search I know I have to be patient and Im happy when I get into the game. I know Halo  wont have anything close to the issues MCC has and even if there are for some weird reason matchmaking issues initially Im still excited for the story. Im sad to see the state this game has put this subreddit but its the same reason I stopped reading the BungieWaypoint forums years ago. After Reach the Bungie forums became cancer with demanding kids. After Halo  the Waypoint forums became cancer with demanding kids. Now this subreddit has more excuses to be angry but the fact that theres no logical thought processes on the situation makes it the same cancerous forum as Bungie and Waypoint before. Trying to praise the game results in pissed of kids downvoting you the only thing that makes it to the front anymore is complaints and thats not what this community is about. I hope in the coming weeks people come to their senses but its pretty much guaranteed to be like this even after MCC is fixed. Well see but its been a fun ride rHalo.

My true love of the Halo franchise comes from playing online multiplayer with my friends. Unfortunately Ive spent about  of my time with this game fucking around in the menus trying to get a damn game to start.I remember once we got a game of SWAT to load.  It was vs and I was on the opposite team as my friends.  The saddest part about this story is that WE CONSIDERED THAT A VICTORY.  We were so fucking stoked that we finally got into a game that we just dealt with it.  Another sad thing about my personal experience with MCC is that I literally nagged two of my friends for months before MCCs launch to buy an Xbox One.  We all live far away from each other now and playing Halo sounded like a good way to get the gang back together.  So they dropped the money for a new console and this new game... but it turns out we got this pile of shit game instead.This games launchfollowing few months have been an absolute embarrassment to Microsoft and .  Just because things are slowly getting better doesnt mean we should forget about how big of a shitshow the first two months have been.

Many of them entered the preview as a way to get updates early and just complain at the forums instead of giving good feedback. Also many arent from USA and the patch beta is USA only.Since the objective is to receive good feedback giving the patch to every preview member instead of verified members that have an history of giving insightful feedback can do more harm than good.Maybe they are distributing the cu beta in waves and youll still receive yours.

I played Halo   and reach to death so its a huge shame that I cant even get into the new ones.And I personally feel like the TTK wont be fixed that may just be cynicism but the game is too fast paced as it is.

So this video looks like its more of a message to halo fans giving the reason why you shouldnt buy halo .Personally Im not going to buy halo  either. Halo  was the nail in the coffin for me and after hearing the countless  apologists talk about how codlike features improve the game I knew Halo was never going to be a highly competitive sandbox shooter again. And now we got Halo  which is basically just a twitch shooter with a halo skin. And you know im sure tons of people will still buy it and have fun with it for  weeks while its in and then move on to something else or just stop playing.  will collect their precious money while the  apologists will defend them against the veteran halo fans writing essays detailing all the things wrong with the game. ,halo,co174t4,1,t5_2qixk

3047204,0,t3_2v0zj4,You just became my favorite person on this sub. I feel like a lot of people on here believe that making a game with competition in mind somehow means it wont be fun for the more casual players. In actuality its the opposite. If the game has a good matching system on top of it so new players arent getting destroyed  they will have fun. If they remain casual their rank will stay around the same area and theyll always get fun even games. However even casual players were competitive in Halo  and  for a simple reason the skill gap. There was always something to improve on and the incentive of the ranks to learn more so you could reach that next level. Having a high ceiling thats always available is what makes people keep playing. It isnt there to ruin casuals fun its there to add to their experience if they so choose. Oh and also I could of swore I read somewhere that they were making the H spawn system more team based like it was in CE. ,halo,codubhd,5,t5_2qixk

3061532,0,t3_2v7mox,I think the sound balance is a bit disappointing in all the games. In CE and  quite often the sound effects and music drown out the dialogue during gameplay. Then conversely in  there are instances where the sound effects completely overshadow the music. I was actually playing through the last level of Halo  earlier and it was really annoying me that all the sound effects like the gunfire and warthog engine were really loud but I could barely hear the music at all. There are plenty of other games that lower sound effects and music during dialogue and ramp them up during gameplay segments without any dialogue. Dont see why they couldnt have made it so sound effects were a little lower when music hit and both were turned down whenever there was dialogue. Ive experienced it in plenty of other games so I know it can be done.,halo,cofbpfj,10,t5_2qixk

3110042,0,t1_cokadtw,gt If it helps at all I did the digging for us both. I appreciate the effort but Im already well aware of Bungies quote.gt Thatd leave room for her to check over his records but again its a toss up. She doesnt need a clearly stated reason to do it.She may not need it but its a confusing narrative tool to even bring up Halsey and the Gettysburg if the scene is supposed to be a retcon. You brought up in an earlier post that its common to reference the original scene when doing a retcon and while this is true its usually to either add additional information or reveal something hidden not to discredit what was shown entirely.gt Its not even a vague retconIt is from an inuniverse lens.gt Its only loosely relevant to the discussions and contributes nearly nothing to the conversation... It just simply doesnt matter when talking about things from within a storys plot... Its not even a vague retconBut were not talking about elements within the storys plot because were discussing Bungies outside comments. From the inuniverse story itself the retcon is vague. Breaking Quarantine in and of itself does not establish Johnson not having an attempted infection especially since he was attacked by Infection Forms in some versions of the  Guilty Spark cutscene and the comic takes place after the cutscene even if only by seconds.My point in bringing up  and Bungie is that  is more committed to making the books jive with the games. And yet despite the big ole contradiction that exists between First Strike and Breaking Quarantine they did nothing to address this in The Definitive Edition rerelease. They have in their The Fall of Reach and First Strike rereleases fixed or attempted to fix most continuity errors that were retconned by later Bungie media.However Johnsons immunity in First Strike remains. Now granted they didnt fix every contradiction that existed in The Fall of Reach since doing so would mess with the big picture of the book. You could argue that the Johnson immunity storyline is a big part of First Strike but it doesnt cover much of the book despite how important it is. Still there is no change to what was presented in the original print.Long point short the EU is in a different state of importance with  than with Bungie and that is why its worth consideration in this topic. The First Strike rerelease does nothing to attempt to fix the point of contention even though there are multiple other times when  have addressed conflicts through intext retcons or through the new Adjunct sections.These last two paragraphs are the crux of what Im trying to get at.So my point is that the Johnson immunity storyline if not the immunity itself may still exist in Halo canon. It boils down to how we should interpret a  rerelease versus outofuniverse comments made in .Again Im not trying to state that Johnson is immune. Im simply saying that whether or not he is is difficult to say for sure because the details are complicated.,halo,cokcrpo,1,t5_2qixk

3186577,0,t3_2whnos,Why is everyone always talking about how difficult it is to combine all these games together always talking about how many studios worked on this and all this other stuff that doesnt even matter.The biggest issue by far in MCC is the party and matchmaking systems are broken. The party system which is controlled from the brand new main menu cant even reliably get people into the same party. This has nothing to do with how many game engines there are in MCC. There could be zero game engines and it still wouldnt work correctly. The next major issue is directly related to parties. Matchmaking is broken. You have a list of people searching for a game and it cant even correctly find some other people to put them in a party with. This is all still happening before any of the game engines are actually running. Finally if by some miracle a match is made the game engine selected is started. This part actually works pretty reliably. The games actually run when told to run. There are some bugs present but this sub wouldnt be up in flames if partiesmatchmaking actually worked.You really need to just look at who was responsible for the party and matchmaking systems to see why this game failed. And correct me if Im wrong but that was . Maybe Microsoft too if they forced  to use the new multiplayer API before it was tested.,halo,cosaf3b,1,t5_2qixk

3288393,0,t1_cp32vsh,OK first of all Halo never became a Call of Duty lookalike. It definitely took some inspirations from Call of Duty as it went along such as Halo  presets which were a terrible idea for Halo but calling it a lookalike is exaggerating.Second making a game more accessible and modern is a good thing. Id argue its necessary to keep the community alive. Just because a competitor has certain traits or a certain style does not mean Halo is becoming a lookalike of that competitor.Movie analogy time! The James Bond movie Quantum of Solace tried to mimic the shakycamera fastcut style from the Jason Bourne movies and it backfired for many Bond fans. Yet both Casino Royale and Skyfall are widely praised for stepping back from the ridiculousness of the Roger MoorePierce Brosnan era Bond movies and yes that was partially inspired from the success of the more gritty Jason Bourne movies. Modern audiences at the time preferred the more realistic take but stealing too many specific elements of the competitor didnt work.Modifying Halo to match more modern tastes i.e. making Bond more gritty is a good thing. It probably should steal some stuff from Call of Duty or Titanfall or even MOBAs particularly centered around mobility. Titanfall was a breath of fresh air to the FPS industry because just moving around the map was fucking joyous. CoD Advanced Warfare took inspiration from that because theyd be crazy not to. If Halo  came out with the same movement physics and options as Halo  the rHalo community would go nuts and the wider gaming commmunity would look at it like an archaic choice like your relative who keeps using VHS tapes. Halo needs to modernize. Some of that includes accessibility changes making the game less obtuse and lowering the barrier of entry to new players.Poorly mimicking specific traits from a competitor trying to add Bourne shakycam to Bond can backfire horribly. Id argue Halo  and HAs weapon loadouts generally felt like it was trying to mimic Call of Duty too much since Halos gameplay traditionally revolved around maintaining map control. Both Halo and Call of Duty have inspired and modified each other where did the Call of Duty designers see regenerating health put into action? and they should continue to do so to keep both games at their best.Sorry if this is rambling I speed wrote this during part of my lunch break and didnt have time to edit    I hope Im clear but if Im not heres a TLDRModernizingmaking Halo more accessible is necessary to keep the community from stagnating. Poorly mimicking competitors is a bad idea but modernizing to match current audience tastes is necessary. Its a subtle distinction that doesnt come across when arguments are oneline shouts.,halo,cp33q2j,1,t5_2qixk

3289880,0,t1_cp3258y,It is only a long process because game developers nowadays overrely on graphics. The structural layout of the Halo  maps are not only finished but they have also been thoroughly playtested. Repurposing the shape of the map to a modified theme is not difficult especially when it is literally your job.s choice to only refurbish  of the maps is not a design decision that should be defended or lauded. It was lazy and the paucity of maps negatively impacts the quality of the HA playlists. Searching for competitive HA matches gets remarkably stale when all of your matches are on three maps with the only variety coming in the shape of three stages that are anything but fun for v Coagulation and Zanzibar are BTB maps! and Ascension has always been a steaming pile.Halo fans have every reason to be disappointed with the what was provided in MCC. The game is still disorganized and party features are still malfunctioning four months into its twelve month life cycle. ,halo,cp39tti,2,t5_2qixk

However this is just my opinion I think  will addrotate them only because we want them and not because they have this quirky sense of humor Bungie had.  I think wants to take Halo in such a serious direction. I say this because how hard they are trying to make HCS happen. Maybe that is what is needed to have Halo survive. I just cant imagine  would have had the creativity to make a medal like steaktacular or display the joke message if you try to flip the Elephant back over on Sandtrap or the dry sense of humor we got in the weekly Bungie updates etc. Not saying one was better or the other but things like Fiesta slayer was Bungie just being silly and not necessarily to add longevity in the game. ,halo,cp9vcd2,4,t5_2qixk

3407499,0,t3_2z8uyx,Basic tip is play to survive and not kills. Halo has a longer time to kill than games like Battlefield and COD. The Battle Rifle should be your go to weapon. At a minimum it takes  shots to kill. This takes between . and . seconds depending on which version you are playing. Each missed burst adds to this. A missed burst or two means your opponent can get behind cover or if hes talented enough turn around and kill your first. So by playing to survive and not to kill I mean you need to play more passively than in faster games like COD or Battlefield. In those games its easy to run around a corner mop up  guys with their backs turned and back around a corner. Halo is much more about being positioned correctly and not running around a corner guns blazing. Chances are you will be running into more than one person which very rarely means you will survive. ,halo,cpgohs3,2,t5_2qixk

3476145,0,t1_cpogfrh,Yeah porch dick  Pete. These are just my assumptions. Im really not sure how many people are going to die as the show veers off from the comics but big plot points generally remain the same. They never exile Rick in them so I assume he wont be in the show either though it could happen briefly. I guess Ill quickly explain the differences in the comics. Some characters dont exist in them. Beth Bob Daryl Sasha Noah TDog Merle Tara and probably a few more that Im forgetting. Some of them die sooner some of them die later and some of the characters in the show take the place of characters in the comics in certain ways. For instance in the comics Andrea is still alive at this point and shes the expert sniper up in the tower rather than Sasha. There was never a thing between her and the Governor. Dale lives a while longer and Bob kind of takes his place at least in death. They die in the same way with the whole leg getting eaten thing and the Tainted meat! line. Also Andrea actually fucks him in the comics. Carol seems to be younger and more attractive in the comics and fucks Tyrese. Tyrese actually has a daughter that commits suicide and her boyfriend tries to do it with her but doesnt pull it off so Tyrese kills him. That part was back at the prison. Shane dies earlier at the first camp and never makes it to the farm. The farm also doesnt get overrun until later. Hershel kicks them out and they find the prison then they go back and tell him about it and he comes with them. Terminus doesnt exist. They really all head back to the farm and meet up there. Thats when they run into Abraham Rosita and Eugene and thats when the farm gets overrun. They just run into the cannibals at the church since theres no Terminus. Anyway theres a lot more shit thats different but the main plot points stay the same. The first camp Shane getting killed by Carl the farm the prison the governor attacking the prison the church and the cannibals heading to Washington and finally Alexandria. Now I know that Rick takes control and its handed to him willingly but the leader of Alexandria in the comics Douglas not Dianna completely sides with Rick while Deanna doesnt seem to be. I also know that they get attacked soon so Im just assuming that they get attacked and thats when Deanna realizes Rick would be a better leader because hes been right all along. Also in the comics porch dick loses his shit and kills someone so I just assume that will happen in the next episode because thats when it happens in the comics and he seems sufficiently butthurt at this point. Anyway if you want to hear spoilers and plot points that will happen next season Id be happy to tell you.,halo,cpoi888,1,t5_2qixk

As of  the UNSC had developed nanotechnology designed to perform repairs on MJOLNIR armor while its Spartan occupant rested in cryosleep. Given enough time and in the hands of a capable smart AI these nanomachines were capable of completely overhauling a suit. While the Charonclass light frigate Forward Unto Dawn drifted through space for four years the AI Cortana used nanomachines to upgrade and redesign Johns MJOLNIR Mark VI armor. A similar form of nanotechnology was incorporated into the MJOLNIR Mark VII allowing the suit to repair and upgrade itself autonomously during cryosleep. This feature was presumably carried over to the MJOLNIR GEN.,halo,cqrx90n,1,t5_2qixk

3902885,0,t1_cr0yq9a,Just to represent people that dont suck BR difficulty was tuned down in H to the extreme. It was by far the easiest game for landing  shots.Also talking about how AR should totally be better close range is fine in the context of a quick small close quarters battle with a camper but AR and SMG tore up huge distances in H relative to the other games. I am absolutely an elitist for BR combat so Im biased out of irritation but I still think the distance for those guns was extended way beyond what they should be for a Halo game again not that it mattered too much since BR was also dummed down to handle it. The idea of strengthening the guns makes sense in the context of how they handle in the Halo extended universe books for example as well as how theyd function in real life but thats not how you model games and thats not how the game universe has been. The continuity of the prior games is getting fucked up because  is starting to cater to casual players by strengthening slop weapons and empowering players with crazy abilities. ,halo,cr15vzd,-27,t5_2qixk

3958209,1,t3_35s5ri,This sub the Beyond forums and Waypoint were all polled and the vast majority of the vocal Halo community doesnt want sprint. For some fucking reason its going to be in Halo  after weve seen the negative impact it has had on two games already. Ironically sprint causes games to be slower because of how the maps have to be designed when clearly  is using it as a device to make the game faster. Sprint is still a get out of jail free card and it always has been and always will be in a Halo game. No amount of balancing will fix this. People talk about Halo evolving but look at how horrible the games with sprint have turned out to be. The devs keep trying to modernize Halo when the fact that Halo was different from the masses of generic FPS titles out there is why it did so well in the first place. We need to let Halo be Halo because just cramming in shit from other games and calling Halo modernized doesnt fucking work.,halo,cr7gx0i,4,t5_2qixk

Or am I an average player because I dont try to get into competitions and I didnt try to get into competitions when I was really good. If it is the competitive player that is the expert then experts are like travel agents. When change rolls around what they do is in peril because of change so they have to adjust to become useful or get put to pasture. An expert might not want to adjust. They probably just want everything to stay the same because thats what they were good at. For a lot of things I would like to have a republic for making decisions but for multiplayer games I think they should have their input but I dont want a game made to please a couple hundred people especially when those people will want everything to stay the same forever. And sprint sucks. I want it out of there is not creative input. Just backwards thinking and negativity. And it doesnt negate those things. It makes it more difficult but it doesnt negate it.

Also all the halo titles have accuracy reduction due to rapid fire it just doesnt tell you in any game before halo Reach.

I am curious to know which  player maps you feel are barren. Youll probably cite Danger Canyon as your example so let me counter it preemptively this map is never barren give that you play it correctly warthog battles. That empty space is meant to be traversed via hog or tank. Timberland is definitely not as large as you say given that players have a high FOV and again you should be using warthogs to traverse the length. Since we are talking technically the Halo  used in MCC is its own version because after it was ported it was updated and upscaled rendering both metacritics inert. ,halo,crvvjml,2,t5_2qixk

4261103,0,t1_cs5xstb,gtThats not a very effective buff considering how limited its uses would be. In a normal v situation those first few shots that you think should be more accurate will just do shield damage. And with the AR if you drop someones shields and stop firing to get that accuracy bonus per say that precious half a second between your bursts will get you killed. I get what you are saying but I still disagree. if you are using the AR correctly you are constantly feathering the trigger to pull off  round bursts anyways to conserve ammo and stay accurate while still keeping a good rate of fire. I did this tactic constantly in halo reach which also had a pretty accurate AR and while you might think that the fractions of a second you lose out on lowers your time to kill and would cost you I find that it actually doesnt mainly because if you arent doing that you end up missing a few shots anyways so you end up dealing the same amount of damage or more in the end. Even in very close range I found that  round bursts were optimal you only wanted to  hold down the trigger when you were physical in contact with the other player and could melee them the moment their shields dropped. Doing the above at a distace requires a good amount of self control and skill to pull off to land the shots consistently and rewarding players who do that with a headshot bonus only further increases the skill gap there. Adding the additional ammo in the magazine lowers it since it only helps players who will miss and will need th extra ammo to finish somebody off. gtThe AR should stay what it is. A starter automatic spray and pray weapon. It should be the first one you get rid of in your inventory just like it has been in almost every Halo I really really disagree here. Whats the point then? Why even have it? Why not start with the BR or SMG since the SMG preforms better up close and the BR preforms better at a distance?Having the AR be a spray and pray gun you just switch out is bad balance and makes it totally surplus. This is why I like reach the AR isnt just a surplus gun because firstly there is no SMG and secondly it has a greatly extended range in that game which allows it to be the most useful non power weapon up close to a good distance since the DMR is more focused at medium long range rather then medium range so the AR has a wider range of... range where it is the best gun to use. Youd be surprised at how viable the AR is against DMR users in reach out to medium distances if you use bursts as you close the gap before finishing them off with a melee.  Do you have any other reasoning for why you prefer it like that other then thats the status quo because reach already changed that status quo a bit. ,halo,cs5y1dp,1,t5_2qixk

Thats a good thing.Running steady true  frame rates also ties to the entire simulation for most realtime games  this is never more true than in single player.Youre essentially running several versions of the game at once that are allthe same game and need to be in synch.This takes a ton of resources to not fuck up and every player introduces another chance for it to go wrong.In multiplayer much of the data is exchanged in net code its essentially a different game its simulation is also differently configured  each split screen player is essentially their own client.Its much less stressful to fix and polish and theres more opportunities for performance to match up as long as the net codebandwidth dont ruin it for everyone.TLDR Player count doesnt necessarily affect frame performance  and is less likely to reduce frame rate than split screen.,halo,csafnx5,1,t5_2qixk

4305852,1,t3_3aaocs,Nah they are absolute bullshit.These are consumable weapons and vehicles in a gametype where the only way to get these weapons and vehicles is to consume them. And the fact of the matter is somebody who buys more packs has a greater chance of having a greater quantity of higher quality of cardsand higher quality cards are more powerful but cost the same to pull out of a terminal. Somebody who buys a ton of packs to stock up on Rares has an inherent advantage over somebody who doesnt.These are by far the most egregious battle packs in any game I can think of. CSGO? Only cosmetics. Battlefield? Most powerful battle pack item is the tac light and theres no situation where theyll lock you out of spawning in a vehicle because you didnt open enough packs. CoD? You still get the base version of every item no matter what and anything you get is yours forever. Titanfall? They wont let you buy burn cards even if you want to. And to make matters worse they are conveniently leaving out BTB at launch leaving the gametype you can pay for as the only option for players who want a larger scale game.How can you people think its fine that  is selling power in ANY capacity? in what way would it not be just hands down  better for every player if these packs were strictly cosmetic? This is the same community that threw their hands up over just loadouts and now  is offering something FAR worse and more impactful and you want people to give this shit a chance?

4314356,0,t1_csbma5n,Im sure that the microtransactions will probably get bad enough that the community starts pushing back which is when theyll reel it in. Xbox has spent far too much money trying to salvage their reputation to let it get destroyed by a quick buck. Id rather not argue a slippery slope when its not likely to ever get bad enough to affect arena gameplay. From my perspective Warzone is the casual gamers haven and theyre not going to care about a slight advantage due to microtransactions. Competitive gamers will still be at home in Arena. ,halo,csbydsj,1,t5_2qixk

4355347,0,t1_csgc19z,They tried an individual ranking system in Reach and it was terrible. Teammates would hoard weapons let you die go out of their way to steal your kill eg not helping in a fight until you get the guy one shot then they  finish the kill and wouldnt work together. It felt more like it was vv where that team of  wasnt directly trying to kill me. It is definitely frustrating when you go  in a Team Slayer game and still lose but if the ranking system works you should be placed with people around your level and those types of games will be a rare fluke. If you find yourself unable to rank up despite destroying every game either try to find a party to get your rank where it should be or reanalyze your game to figure out why your team isnt winning. Some players will grab Rockets and Sniper and then get a lot of kills but their high kill count is partially offset by them hoarding two power weapons which means your teammates are stuck with the weaker weapons. ,halo,csgkwo4,2,t5_2qixk

Those personsized booster frames also had shield tech which Im pretty sure was still a ways off from being properly reverseengineered. Logistically making booster frames wouldnt make sense either because most military personnel dont have the equipment training or experience for vacuum combat meaning they would have to be specifically designed for Spartans. That point would open up a question as to why Spartans used standard military weapons when theres a clear case that theyd had a custom weapon made for them. Also back to the fluffy Spartan Solomon would never have entered a ship by himself. Proper training dictates that they move forward as a unit especially since they detected the packages signal. Also whats this deal about a signal? How does Halsey have a signal? In the end they didnt even use the signal to track her they assumed she was on the flagship.

These brains were improved with cybernetic enhancements and then the best one underwent cognitive impression modelling destroying it but creating a mind even greater than Halseys.

4548457,0,t3_3dbmr8,For two reasons. First of all ODST takes place during the Great Schism the Covenant civil war where the Brutes take over from the Elites. Its a shift in power the elites are betrayed and are slaughtered by their allies by their Prophets. Truth had been scheming with Tartarus to get rid of the Elites and the other Prophets. Everywhere in the galaxy Elites were being captured or killed by Jiralhanae forces.The second reason is because you fight Regrets fleet as Master Chief in Halo  while you fight Truths fleet as the Rookie in ODST. Regret was known as a friend to the Elites his fleet was comprised of only Elites grunts hunters and Jackals. Truths fleet had little to no Elites on it and was lead by the Brutes. In the beginning of Halo ODST you see Regrets ship go into slipspace to Delta Halo. The In Amber Clad and Master Chief with it go in pursuit in Halo . The Rookie crashes and is unconscious for a couple of hours. In that time Truths fleet arrives on Earth. His dropships land full of Brutes. These Brutes probably have orders to shoot any human and Elite on sight including anyone that supports them. Thats why you only see dead Elites in the streets of New Mombasa. They thought they were getting reinforcements while they were actually being betrayed.,halo,ct3yhac,2,t5_2qixk

4595032,0,t3_3dttgh,What works for me is making sure I dont spend alot of time on the bottom level of a map I try to stay on top of ramps the flat part not the incline it makes BR battles harder when your scope moves at an angle so if I need to drop off to stay alive I can. If you are on top of the map you have a better view of whats going on you can see spawns objectives and power weapons. The other thing is making sure you dont attempt to grab a flagbomb or ball when the other team doesnt have AT LEAST two people dead. If you are going to fight some one try putting  shots on the body and the last shot on the head the hit box for the spartan body is larger than the head of course so you will most likely land those three shots then you can move to the head for the kill with a much better hit rate. If you are fighting some one across the map with your BR and you have been hit more than twice with out getting the other person one shot just drop out of that battle and call them out for your team mate to clean up the kill. At any point if you feel that your team is crowded on one side of the map check your backs right away you are probably getting flanked. Its better to stay alive and win than trying hard to get those kills to feel like a good player and die. If you are getting  kills  assists and  death its better than getting  kills  assists and  deaths because you stayed alive and got your team  kills  kills your self and  that you assisted and only died once making your contribution to the team  clean kills on the other hand you got  kills but your contribution was  to your team.

4641056,0,t1_ctfflmw,You should read this copypaste I picked up a while back in the off chance I ran into someone like you.The dont preorder! movement seems to be founded on a big false principle that nobody cares to bring up. The idea that preordering encourages developers not to care. Apparently to lots and lots of people if youre making a product and suddenly learn that  people want it your next response is to say Wow were rolling in dough from th of our projected sales figures! Who even cares anymore? and cease competent production putting out the bare minimum because even if the game sucks  people already bought it. Which of course is completely stupid and says a lot about the work ethic of many redditors. Nevermind the attitude it shows towards developers. There arent any human beings working on these games who truly want them to be good. Who go to work every day for  hours making things for the game. Who all work together on a project for years with the end goal being a product that people enjoy. People apparently dont think thats what happens they think there are two entities The developer and the producer. Individual entities that are only in it for cash. Its the same as going to the store and ignoring employees or treating them as anything but fellow human beings but its even easier for people because those individuals dont come up often in conversation. Its always the concept of the developer or the publisher and people demonize those groups with ease. SimCity  was made to them by a bad developer. Not by a team of people who wanted to make something fun and cool and interesting and unique and creative and new. By stupid EA. The people who worked on that game are nameless faceless entities to most people and that lets them react to their decisions and the circumstances of a games development with absolute and utter vitriol to the point where they have deluded themselves into thinkingnobody actually wants to make a good game unless theyre getting a lot of money and that preordering fills that void and thus they stop wanting to make a good game. People truly think that if you say Hey I want this game and I want it when it comes out at my door on launch or possibly preloaded before launch youre saying Take my money and since you already have it cease production on the game and rush it out. I dunno where people got the idea that this is how it works. But it just plain is not. Preorder numbers RARELY meet even the most underestimated sales figures and no developer is going to see preorders and consider them good enough for sales. When they DO meet estimates of sales figures its because the game was big name enough and from a good studio. Smash . Zelda games. GTAV. Besides they dont get your money from preordering. If I preorder Fallout  on steam right now thats not money handed to Bethesda for development. Its money handed to steam who already paid bethesda for keys anyway. In many cases the place you preorder from doesnt even get your money until the game releases! You are not funding laziness this is not a thing! If someone wants a game the day it comes out preordering is a fine idea. It affects no one else. It guarantees a copy. With digital games it often guarantees a preload. Preorders almost always come with something extra. If you want the game trust the developer and would like any of those benefits why not preorder? The game might be bad? ALL games might be bad and preordering doesnt change that. Buying the game at retail doesnt suddenly make the game good. And even if its good you still might not like it so it doesnt matter either way! If you suspect the game will be bad youre not going to preorder it anyway. Who preorders things they dont expect with reason to be good? Nobody. So who cares?,halo,ctfklgd,3,t5_2qixk

The animation isnt as long as youre making it seem. Sure if a player is floating easily within my line of sight and hes in the air for a decent interval of time I could kill him or at the very least move out of the way. But it almost never happens that way and you know it. Im running a flag or putting shots on someone looking in an opposite direction and now Im dead or no shields because they strapped a fucking rocket pack to Master Chief...gtIf you cant kill a player who used a thruster when they are LOSING a gunfight Im in a gunfight with someone theyre losing. They then press the thruster button and boom theyre around a corner. I now have to put my gun down and sprint after them but oh look theres a teammate of theirs. The thruster is essentially the panic button for when you fuck up makes players live in situations where they normally would have died and is a get out of jail free card just like sprint. gtor a player whos run away with shields that dont recharge anymore YOU are the unskilled player.Im not sure if youre aware of this but chasing is almost never the right thing to do in Halo. With sprint I have to put my gun down and sprint to chase this dude whos getting away. All he has to do is sprint to the nearest teammate and now Im fighting a v and my shields havent come back either. I seriously dont understand how people can defend this shit. Maybe were are the point where most people here are fans of s style of gameplay. However weve seen how thruster and sprint drastically reduce the skill gap with Halo . Weve literally had a full games worth of evidence and somehow people still defend it because theyre going to be forced to use it again.,halo,ctgyz9l,-1,t5_2qixk

That was it there was very little variation to the gameplay and less to master. As a matter of fact the pistol had a bloom system much like reaches which when playing online would make gun fights more about who got lucky with the RNG based bloom system then skill and this was exacerbated at longer ranges.,halo,ctlym0r,-1,t5_2qixk

4747660,0,t3_3d9ypg,So I decided to try and get through Halo  on Legendary to see what all the fuss was about. Im on Delta Halo at Over the Rock Through the Bush nothing but Jackal and thats where disaster strikes. Im in a particularly bad spot when the game decides to give me a checkpoint. However whenever I died the game would crash. Itd then make me load up the game again and wait for it to put me back where I was. This plus Jackal snipers and Drones made it one of the most difficult and time consuming things I have ever done in a video game. Whats worse is that the Anniversary mode bugged out as well. Whenever I tried to use the updated graphics after I had died the first time it would give me a glaringly white screen with nothing on it. This meant I had to use the ol  graphics and beat it the old fashioned way without dying under penalty of a game crash. It happened every death without fail every single time I died the game would freeze. After around  hours I had beaten it but I wasnt the same person afterward.TLDR people who say that the campaign works fine can piss off and stop spewing bullshit.,halo,ctszkey,2,t5_2qixk

A comment made a good point that it will just cause people who want to surrender to grief until the others surrender. Say its v in BTB and one of the  wants to surrender but the other  want to stick it out and get some kills. When the other  dont surrender with the third player the third player might try and betrayirritate the other two players into forcing a surrender when they didnt want to. I do see the need if you are the sole player remaining however games of Halo are quite short so unless you are the last player on your team I dont think it should be an option.

4787518,0,t3_3ggm9h,There is ONE thing that I agree on this article and that is the fact that  is taking a different road in terms of art compared to the Halo games Bungie makes one I like less. Bungie wanted to create an ancient feeling in a scifi world while  is making a modern feeling in a scifi world. Halo games created by Bungie had a lot more color and character compared to what  is doing. This is based on what we saw in Halo  and what I played in the Beta. I hope Im wrong about the art and designs in Halo  though. is reviving the eSports community with Halo  for the future of Halo. If this game succeeds which I think and hope it will than their next game is going to be build around the mechanics of Halo  and will not dramatically change the gameplay again. I understand why they changed A LOT after Halo  because a lot of people disliked it but if people like Halo  than they should not change a lot in their next game like Bungie did with Halo  compared to Halo .,halo,cty07tw,-2,t5_2qixk

They are more likely to go after since its their main mission during the game.Or they dont stop looking for Halsey until they find her on Kamchatka in what is likely the third mission.gtWhy did Josh say that the length of the game is twice as long without saying that the playtime and scale counts.Youll have to ask him.  Just judging from what hes said there is twice as much to do but if youre just going through the game without exploring it will take about as long as most other Halo games.gtAlso I said why would Halsey and Jul be on kamchata later on in the game.That depends we dont know why Kamchatka is important yet.  Halsey likely goes there immediately after stopping by Meridian.,halo,cu74kp1,0,t5_2qixk

4898030,0,t3_3hy1p4,Ive never heard such a load of rubbish in all my life as much as I agree that splitscreen being axed will have a negative ripple on machinima it will ultimately serve the creative people far more than the lazier people.With the greatest of respect to the person who made this video youve done very poor research on this particular subject. Im aware that you were speaking your own opinion on it but youve done it so poorly. We KNOW that Halo  supports weapon lowering whether that support is carried to online modes has yet to be seen but considering it had to be specifically coded into the MCC beforehand it shows that  are aware of it.Another thing to consider is the current lead writer of Red vs Blue Miles Luna who has already experienced Halo  up close and personal to quote Miles Well actually Ive had the pleasure of getting some oneonone time with the game a few weeks ago and Im so excited about being able to machinimate in Halo   theyve done a lot of things with the game that are going to make a lot of machinimators happy.So no I dont think Halo s machinima scene will be lacking. I doubt itll be as strong as it was in the  era but I expect people will build good friendships and trust when it comes to body acting. You should never use randoms or fans in your productions regardless of how much theyd like to help out. Unless theyve got some prior experience and know how to take basic direction then theyre useless.I understand how ridiculous that sounds that people should have experience moving a couple of sticks and pushing a couple of buttons but from experience Ive learned that good friends and people who can listen carefully are the key to success.

4924626,0,t3_3ibwo4,Halo  is my favorite overall due to the campaign really being memorable in my eyes since I replayed it a shit ton. It also had a great story IMO getting a bit more personal until we got WAY more personal in Halo  with the whole Cortana thing. It was also the first multiplayer online I did for Halo. I did split screen with brothers parents and sisters in Halo  but Halo  is when i finally got Xbox Live. Little  year old me was so excited.Least favorite is probably CE. I might get hated for it but IDC. The multiplayer is somewhat good I feel like there are a lot of issues like wonky vehicle physics overpowered pistols frustrating map design etc. Its still fun to play though. Campaign was gripping and interesting but still my least favorite. Overall I dont like the gameplay mechanics of CE that much. They were good back in  not that good in . Halo CE is still a great game just my least favorite out of all the others.So to sum it up. gtODSTgtgtgtReachgtCE.

4927338,0,t1_cufibxt,Yeah i presume BTB will still be v in matchmaking atleast.you could be right  players might be locked to warzone but building on what user said earlier  it would make sense for  player customs because the server wouldnt have to deal with the A.I because warzonewarzone maps arent forgeable plus the fact its a dedicated server so you would have to rely on someones  Mc donalds happy meal connection to host the game.gtCurrently they have yet to mention much about custom games or Forge so really it could go either way. It would be nice to have  player custom games but then what about Forge? Is that able to handle  players individually over a network all spawningdestroying objects? They have already said that Warzone maps are not Forgeable but that doesnt necessarily say  players on Forge would not work most likely just means that messing with Warzone map layouts would cause the AI and gametype to become FUBAR.gttldr At this point we can only know that  players is Warzone exclusive. Until they show Forge which will likely have mention of custom games since they go together like peanut butter and jelly we really have no idea since theres no precedent to a raised player cap until Halo  now.Theyd be no need for  player forge lobbies halo reach had  player max custom games and had  maximum in forge.

The trilogy never addressed the other Spartans but the book between Halo CE and Halo  First Strike centered around Blue Teams survival of the war on Reach and some of the buildup to the invasion of Earth. Blue Team is Master Chiefs team and theyre the stuff of legend and that was before even Halo  came out. Unfortunately their existence has been ignored by the games preferring to give the impression that Chief was literally the last of his kind.The existence of the SpartanIII and SpartanIV programs came into the story later when the story called for supersoldiers that hadnt spent a lifetime in training.,halo,cunr1js,12,t5_2qixk

5028238,0,t3_3jsyqs,I know its too late now but you should really stress with that the AR you NEVER want to just hold down the trigger unless you are am arms length away from the other player shooting in  round bursts with more or less shots in each burst depending on how far away you are from your target more up close less farther out will not only greatly increase the viable range of the weapon but will minimize spread and help you conserve ammo. You to walk forward towards them while doing this so as you are dealing damage you are closing the gap putting yourself into a more advantageous position. You can also do this to pick off injuried targets in another engagement at medium rangePlayers just using the AR like a machine gun and not bothering to aim or burst is one of the most common mistakes you see players of all levels of experience and skill do Seriously even esports players do it the extremely rare times they use it simply because in prior titles the AR was so bad generally speaking that you never wanted to use it past like  feet anyways and they never bothered to really try to use the weapon to its limit.  But in  and in reach for that matter since the AR is actually useful and will likely get more use then it did in last titles it is imperative that you burst and doing so will greatly increase the usefulness of the weapon and the range you can effectively use it from. In reach  Ive killed DMR users in engagements that started out in mediumlong range by doing this simply because they werent prepared to be hit back at these distances and by the time I had closed the gap and entered melee range I had depleted their shields and finished them with a melee. In the  beta the AR is was better and more often then not I killed them before I even got into melee range by doing this. ,halo,cus3e8w,1,t5_2qixk

Its designed to fragment on detonation with the fragments doing most of the damage. This devastates unarmored infantry but would be much less effective against shielded and armored targets. Most other anti personnel explosives work on the same principle. It might help more against grunts but grunts are literally cannon fodder meant to use up enemy ammunition. Unless the plan is to level the entire city with the covenant in it which would be counter productive in my opinion I dont see explosives making a huge difference.

Everything looks really good.  Only thing I worried about from scanning the article on waypoint is teleports. gt Object Enhancements  Lots of the returning objects have new features and improvements Dial in the amount of extra clips with weapons. ManCannons and Grav Lifts launch distances and heights can be tuned in their properties and show the path where the players will go when used. Teleporters output directions can now be changed it displays which way players come out facing. We have commitment to improving everything Forge not just the new.Edit  Yes I understand it has been in other Halos.  It is what made teleports unusable for MLG maps in Halo .  I would like the option to have H teleports that remember your directional data.  This way you can go through them facing a different direction.  If you know someone is camping the portal you can go in backwards and not get assassinated.  Anyways it is just a minor thing in the context of this new powerful looking forge.  If the player is forced to come out of a teleporter facing one direction another player can camp the portal and kill them.  ,halo,cvqhsn4,15,t5_2qixk

5349456,0,t3_3o681w,Okay so seeing the e demo I think Ive got a guess at the campaign.Chief goes awol because the Didact is still alive still a threat. Hes trying to reactivate and reclaim Forerunner weapons.Chief must stop this Blue Team follows Chief because its a threat that must be stopped.The Guardians are part of this some activated by Didact in spite of Chief some of them might have been activated by Chief and his Librarian genesong stuff. The Warden Eternal lets Chief do this because of the genesong he has become the rightful heirreclaimer to Forerunner technologies and the Mantle. The Didact can still just access stuff because he actually is a Forerunner.Chief makes a temporary truce with the Covenant because they have Halsey and he needs her knowledge of whats going on especially with the Janus Key thing from Spartan Ops.ONI construes the AWOL and his presence with these guardian catastrophes and working with the Covenant as him being a traitor.He just hasnt slowed down enough to tell them whats up or they went the route of Del Rio and refuse to meet the biggest threat on the field and consider him an enemy for doing it alone.Buck is too smart to not switch to Blue Team if given a chance and learning the truth. Locke might be too much of a system man to override his orders from ONI and do the right thing even if it results in civilian casualties.But I cant see Chief just saying fuck off to a bunch of civilians even when going after a bigger threat.,halo,cvvgbsa,1,t5_2qixk

People want Halo to look like Halo. That is a massive reason for many criticisms whether people like it or not. I want  to succeed but it feels like they redo everything all the time.

5368920,0,t1_cvxssdj,Not every single little object or detail or character needs a proper introduction than a cold opening. Do we really need to know Infinitys backstory? No we just need to know its function which is laid out by Lasky. It works perfectly fine as just some Human ship for the time being. Knowing more about it is a bonus.And I cant believe you just said that its an assumption to know what a Spartan is. Theyre literally the face of the UNSC war effort ever since their presence was made known to the public. Everyone knows what a Spartan is. And given MCs long and decorated career is it too much of a jump to say hes known plenty of service men and women that we havent seen yet? Is that really too hard? Am I asking too much?On Palmer in no way can you say that she had a spotlight on her in campaign. All she did was give orders to a handful of soldiers and to the MC for like a mission or two and then shes gone. She was just the SpartanIV commander and thats all we needed to know. We expect SpartanIVs to have a commander. She was introduced briefly as Cmdr Palmer and that was that. You act like the plot was hinging on knowing her personally but she was just a background CO to flesh out the Infinity crew. Nothing more for Halo s campaign.The Librarian also doesnt just give a two minute exposition. She gives freaking soliloquies in the terminals. The Didact too. Thats all you needed really.So no you dont at all need any EU. All you need is Halo  and its terminals unless you have trouble with comprehension or something.Also how is this any less confusing than the cold opening of Halo CE? Who the fuck are the Covenant and why are they attacking Humanity? NONE of that is addressed directly in the game. TFoR explains that but for Halo CE theyre just enemy fodder for now. The Forerunner are given no backstory and exist only as a setting for Humans vs Aliens. Yet you werent spinning in circles over that?,halo,cvxxu5n,3,t5_2qixk

5466829,0,t1_cwae61i,The easiest way to describe hitscan is there is no travel time for the bullets.  So in Halo  you had to aim way ahead of a person if they were far away leading your shots to hit them. In recent games hhah hitscan was put in so you dont have to lead your shots when shooting at someone.  The bullets connect with the target the instant you pull the trigger.  Thats why its so much easier to get a perfect  shot in hitscan games as opposed to hs projectile system. ,halo,cwaft9w,5,t5_2qixk

5481213,0,t1_cwc9juj,I can explain how i did it better.s When you first start Immediately start running forward to where the ramp is also while running command your team to hide behind one of the  towers in front of where the wardens start it gets blown up by warden you should have enough time to get to those  incineration cannons before they hit the ground once the wardens jump off the platform and land they have about  seconds of just standing there grab a cannon and start running left or right to one of the towers where you can clamber up to not get one shotted by the orangeyellow beam of death. At this point proceed to unleash hell on one of them or you can use the first cannons ammo to hit all  at least once make sure your always on the move and keep heading towards the sides where there is ammo and those grav boosts are. Also make sure your in cover for when he does his Black hole attack. Your team will die so make sure they get at least one down you can run around the cover on the sides where the boosts are for the warden that is chasing you but keep in mind the other warden that is charging up shots whenever he sees you. Best advice i can give lol this fight is really hard on legendary. Apparently you can cheese it with shotguns while standing close to them but you need to be  accurrate and hit its back everytime lol. This fight is  focus... no downtime,halo,cwc9yj0,2,t5_2qixk

5498208,0,t1_cwedus0,Agreed i even think they could have used the Warden as the antagonist. They could have gone with that when the Didact was defeated he activated the Warden to take the mantle instead of letting humanity have it. Then the warden could use some piece of cortana if they had to have her in the game to lure Chief into activating the guardians. Thus triggering Locke and tam to actually hunt Chief down.gtAnd did it bug anyone else how they made this big deal of Halsey defecting to a fucking terrorist and it was solved in the first mission? Really turned the ending of Spartan Ops from H into a joke.It only bothered me how cool everyone was with her really a big dissconect after the Halsey hatefest that was halo  and its comics.

5498209,0,t1_cweef67,Im actually starting to think that the simply complete this level achievements cant be unlocked with those skulls. That would explain the conflicting information. I had already beaten all the levels before on a different difficulty. I have no idea whether those achievements affect you unlocking the legendary campaign achievements but I would think those are triggered by the mission select screens tracking with there not being any legendary level achievements to track for it.Waypoint sometimes takes a little while to update and the active profile message just happens sometimes and you need to fully reset MCC before continuing any missions but you know when that bug has caused you to loose progress because you wouldnt see the completion on the select screen.Sorry I cant give you a more concrete answer. I think the only way to know for sure would be to complete an entire unplayed campaign with the skull and see if you get the achievement. The fact that you got the special level completion achievement makes me lean towards you being able to continue using the skull but Id hate to recommend that and have you waste your time.,halo,cweg59g,1,t5_2qixk

5505438,0,t3_3qi0me, Theyre from the novel Fall of Reach and beyond. They trained with the Master Chief and were his closest friends. I would recommend reading Fall of Reach Ghosts of Onyx and the Halo Escalation The next  Hours arc. Basically theyre just a team of the most versatile Spartan IVs that do asset retrieval. The first mission of the game is their first mission of the game. He became a Spartan sometime after the events of Halo  I believe. Initially he was the only person to ever refuse becoming a Spartan because his team wouldnt be Spartans. Then it was revealed that Mickey was a traitor and the Rookie was KIA. Buck took the offer to become a Spartan after that the remaining members of his squad did as well. He worked with them until he was assigned to Osiris.Again read Halo Escalation. Its revealed the Chief doesnt want to stop going on missions. Hes pushing himself to the limit so he doesnt have to think about Cortana. That one I legitimately dont know. I dont even know if he was so sure he wasnt hallucinating. Hes been so wrought with grief at the loss of Cortana that he jumped at any chance to get her back. My guess is Halsey told them where the next Guardian was going to activate and it just so happened that Blue Team figured it out shortly after Halsey revealed it to Infinity. Not an Assassin but a retrieval team. They never intended to kill the Master Chief. Spartan IVs are comparable to Spartan IIs so its not a stretch to imagine Osiris could beat Blue Team. Well the DIdact got teleported to a forerunner installation after Halo  so its not a stretch to imagine the part of the ship that contained Cortana was slipspaces elsewhere.Hes the guardian of the protector of the Mantle of Responisibility is the best answer I can give. Hes either a digitized forerunner or an extremely advanced A.I. so its possible he saw the potential of COrtana and the Created and chose a new Reclaimer race. Yeah.... It was a collective intelligence set up by the Precursors and accessible by the Forerunners. Its said to be alive in some way Im guessing whatever sentience it had fused with Cortana merging the two. Basically Cortana is now a Precursor AI.,halo,cwfdd95,1,t5_2qixk

Like Halsey and Cortana  its been what two years since Halo s ending  a lot could have happened in that time frame Im sure there will be a reasonable explanation. And AIs were never salty about rampancy but now essentially what is happening is that they are borderline rampant or are getting there and Cortana is offering them a solution to it and also asking them to rebel basically.

Why was there an entire game about following them? I guess they got some intel. This game felt like the prologue to another.          . Dont screw over nonbook readers again. One of the biggest complaints about  was that at times it was hard for game only people to understand. Why the heck did they decide pull the Builders out of nowhere in this game?

5521859,0,t3_3qp0y4,Im going to assume you mean Slayer more than anything here but this game rewards supportassist play heavily. For the entire second day of the game I was getting destroyed but winning with a large amount of assists. It was a risky way to play because same as you I was pretty used to getting away with being hyperaggressive.The change I made was my positioning and it has paid off  times over. Basically I never take the exact same path as someone but I follow their angle or where theyre pointingheaded. I do more supportcleanup type play now more than ever. Yes sometimes I engage directly but most times I just try to play safe and run to a good spot to support my other teammates that are in firefights. A lot of the people still stick to their hyper aggressive playstyle and me supporting them from another angle only makes that saferstronger.

5527625,0,t1_cwi74xd,Because in this scenario one team would already own the base and an AI push would give an invading team the edge which could be extremely negative in some cases.There are always AI enemies at the bases.  If no team owns the base its Covenant or Promethean enemies.  If a team owns the base then its AI Marines for that team.  Understand?What Im saying is the idea to add AI enemy raids where they randomly decide to start taking a random teams base and that team has to drop everything to go defend is really dumb because it would ruin the modes rather delicate balance.  Suddenly a team whos got control over most of the map will have a random upper hand on the opposing team with only one base held down if the AI randomly decides to raid the teams one base.  The function would admittedly be a decent counter balance to give an underdog team a chance to retake map control when theyre losing but I just think there are better ways to do that.  Basically its not an inherently bad idea but it would need to be balanced correctly and I dont think it would add terribly much to the flow of these matches and it would affect them horribly if done wrong like if the AI raids could cripple an alreadylosing team randomly.,halo,cwi7bbo,2,t5_2qixk

5528682,0,t1_cwi04yw,No. Harsh penalties for quitters is the only solution. You are effectively rewarding the team who had a quitter while punishing the enemy. Ever have a game where the enemies worst slayer has ish kills and your lowest slayer has ?

If they want to put an end to the MCs adventures I think Halo  will probably be him and cortana going at it and him finding a way to blow up the rest of the rings ending the threat once and for all.  ,halo,cwidh95,6,t5_2qixk

My post was about its nerf in term of range while the maps are all roughly the same small size and movement and TTK has gotten much much faster. All of this equals a motion sensor that contradicts its original purpose as a tool to orientate yourself relative to other players on a single axis in a meaningful way.

5548882,0,t3_3r4qpb,More tips.  Never ever ever sprint if you have enemies on radar unless youre running away. Also never sprint around a corner towards an engagement. That gives them the chance to open fire first. When outnumbered run like hell. Head for more restricted areas and put as many turns as you can between you and your pursuers. And if you can drop a pulse forerunner grenade behind you it will at worst delay them and if youre lucky they will run through it with incredibly diminished health and you can pick them off. Have an escape plan. If at all possible try to engage enemies in an area where you can cut their line of sight with one boost if the engagement begins to go badly. Recoup and live to fight another day. If someone is charging you from the front in attempt to charge you then stand your ground and open fire. Unless youre already damaged it wont kill you. It will however knock you out of their melee range as well as force them into a small cooldown period. By the time theyve recovered you will have already killed them.,halo,cwkw21o,3,t5_2qixk

Its not to say kill stealing shouldnt be allowed but the suggestion would be that damage in the last moments of the bosss life be taken into account  basically last bullet and a certain minimum team damage count over the last couple seconds should be required to register as a steal.

5561901,0,t1_cwm6i65,Fathom is probably one of my least favorite maps in any halo game. Its just two bridge entrances two side rooms you spawn in and the rest of the map is just open area that still manages to be cluttered with barriers and other random shit that just makes any game flow that there would have been non existent. Now that I think about it all of the maps are really cluttered and have no real flow. There arent really any areas to get a long shots or clean kills without being in a complete shootout. Think about it and name one open area in this game other than the back area on Eden. Its like there are zero lines of sight in this game. Then think about Halo . Every map seemed to have a lot of openness and actual long lines of sight. Compared to Halo  now it just seemed to make it way to easy to evade behind cover especially with sprint and boosters. It really just ruins any map flow. And it makes the now super powerful frag grenades even more deadly. But thats a whole other rant.,halo,cwmi66t,2,t5_2qixk

The differences between the Spartan IIs and the Osiris were also not really explored. They both acted and sounded the same maybe Buck was more quippy but it wasnt as though their tactics or technique were any different from each other. This isnt to say that the original trilogy did any of this better but the story of Halo  compensated for a lack of interesting characters. In Halo  there arent any interesting characters and the story is pretty cliched as well. Thats just my opinion though others might see it differently. ,halo,cwn8kpg,5,t5_2qixk

He was a Constructor by birthright but was imprinted by the original Didact a WarriorServant which mutated him and essentially transformed him into the UrDidact.

Not to mention one of the first games to have DLC although even if you paid for all the DLC it was at best a  chance the game would successfully install the map packs and allow you to play the game.  They also shut down the servers so we could no longer play instead of porting the game to Xbox Not to mention this was the early days of Xbox Live and actually getting it set up was a  week process at minimum. So the game that people are nostalgic about today is different then H at launch. People loved Halo  but it was constantly patched and updated to make it into the game that people loved and remembered.  From a gameplay standpoint Halo  is the best BRDMR Halo.  There are a lot of us left that still consider H best gameplay in the franchise.  Having said that we dont consider H and H the best releases in the franchise. The day  package of H had better playlists more features and less problems.  Halo  shattered Day  Sales Records Week  Sales Records Established all Xbox Live records and all Xbox Sales records. Even with its problems it was an amazing release with an even more spectacular game.

I havent noticed one for the DMR at all and the BR is only noticeable because the burst cant hit with all shots at that range. Of course it could do both.

5609478,0,t3_3ryd3p,Copiedpasted from my reply in another threadgt KD and WL alone dont matter. Its who youre playing withagainst in combination with your stats that truly matters. If Player  has a . KD and WL when playing against Bronze players and Player  has a . KD and WL playing against Onyx players do you really think Player  is better than Player ? Player  may have better stats but he got his stats playing against people who are terrible at the game while Player  got his slightly worse stats while playing against really good players. Player  will be ranked higher than Player  because he is better despite his stats not showing that.After your first game which you lost and had a negative KDA the game probably started putting you with worse players than the players your friend was put against because he did well in his first game.,halo,cwserxt,6,t5_2qixk

Its just NOT HALO.Are you seriously telling me that even though Halo  is in the future relative to all other Halo games its got a shorter range than every other Halo game and isnt motion activated like all others.

5693046,0,t1_cx2qj2p,Listen I get it. Those experiences you hold so dear I have many of them myself. When I was  years old I went over to my cousins house. I only had a PS at the time and my stepdad had a PS hed let me play on. My cousin had the OG Xbox and Halo . We played splitscreen all day I even stayed the night so we played until we just knocked out. When I went home the next day I knew I had to get my hands on my own Xbox and Halo . When I finally did my childhood friend who lived  houses down from me would come over and we would play splitscreen coop. We also played multiplayer. Then my Xbox broke and I decided to get a . The friends I started hanging out with in middle school all had their own s as well. We would have LAN parties on a weekly basis. Heres the part where my experience seems to differ from others. Since we all had our own consoles we would set them all up sidebyside and play that way. It was a big enough space to hold  people and consolesTVs. This is how we played.Sure. Sometimes we still had splitscreen going but that was rare. I grew up on splitscreen and eventually upgraded to LANLive. I get not everyone has this luxury. But this is my experience and is a lot of the reason no splitscreen does not affect me. When I was still with my girlfriendatthetime about  years ago we decided to play through all the Halo games splitscreen. She had her own  but it just wasnt as convenient to buy extra copies of every game and Halo  wouldnt even support online coop anyways. It was really fun being able to play with her but it made me realize something. Splitscreen sucks. I have terrible vision. And even with correctional glasses I need to sit within  feet of the TV to be able to see details. When we add splitscreen to the mix cutting  the TV screen in half it makes for a frustrating experience.I would much much rather play through Live where I can have a full TV dedicated to only me. And I am able to do this. Most of the friends I have all have their own Xboxs TVs and Live. To me playing with my friends from the comfort of my own home without needing to make plans for all of us to have days off to hang out beats splitscreen by miles. I am  years old. I am working at least  hours a week on average  and this week I am working  hours. I am also a fulltime college student taking  units this semester trying to finish up so I can transfer to a university. All of my friends I do play with all have adult responsibilities as well. Its a pain to even plan for us to go out for lunch or a movie together much less plan a LAN party. When we do have the very rare time to do a LAN party wed just pack up our Xboxs and TVs and head over. We all drive except one who we can easily give a ride. My experiences have led up to my opinion being that when Live is a thing splitscreen has become irrelevant. None of my friends want to deal with splitscreen anymore. I dont want to deal with it. The only time I may be upset about Halo  not having splitscreen is if I do find myself another girl and she doesnt have an Xbox One we will have to skip Halo  or trade offwatch the other person play. Though the girls I have dated have been gamers and have had their own consoles so I doubt this will be an issue. I understand that there are many people out there who depend on splitscreen and I do offer my sympathy for that. Im just saying from my personal experiences this decision although disappointing does not affect me whatsoever. I actually prefer the direction that  has taken it by prioritizing the quality of the game.,halo,cx2s0fi,2,t5_2qixk
5694542,0,t3_3t1ai3,This is the reason I quit Halo until BTB gets released.  The game mechanic just feels cheap unrewarding and a lazy way of offering a way back to weaker and uncoordinated teams. In a game mode that is v and where team work should be one of the main pillars of the game the game completely ignores rewarding such play and this isnt just for last hitting a boss but also capturing bases which should be the real way back into the game.  ampnbspInstead capturing bases really doesnt reward you anything bar a spawn point besides that they are completely useless which is sad because they could have utilized them much better with different game mechanics that actually change the game dynamic and strategy. From rewarding capture time with points to providing overshields or camos for the capturing team and maybe even some weapons to allow the breaking team push on and go for the win.  ampnbspThe worse part of the game mode when it comes to bosses and last hitting is the fact that the rd and final boss in a close game completely throws the game out off sync because  of the time it is either the winning kill or the kill that will create an unrecoverable margin at the end of the game and having a whole  minute game depend on a last hit is completely deflating. They could either change the timing on the rd boss so that a team could have a chance to mount a come back or disable last hitting on the rd and final boss so that it is truly a battle for the win with both teams going balls to the wall to get him and end the game on a true high and war like atmosphere.,halo,cx2yobk,1,t5_2qixk

Back in the old days if you had a snipertank then you used it because you dont want the other team to grab it. Now its reversed. You dont want to die with those power weaponsvehicles ready for the enemy to pick up. So now where you would have hauled ass across Blood Gulch with the tank youll instead take it a little slower and mind your corners so that you can be a boss of the field.,halo,cx3jow0,3,t5_2qixk

5707799,0,t1_cx4leoo,Well ideally yeah do all three. Im just saying that compared to hunting down and killing a boss taking a base and killing spartans are worth barely anything. Plus when a team keeps rushing a base to try to take it back they tend to feed the enemy a lot of easy kills.Theres an aspect of momentum to the game. When a team keeps spawning at Armory and rushing Garage a few at a time it just encourages more of the enemy to spawn in the Garage to defend it. Defenders have a stronger position so that scenario usually ends in a net gain of points for the defenders. Often times its much better to lay off the pressure on a base and go kill the bosses then try to capture a base between boss spawns when the entire team isnt camping the base.,halo,cx4lwko,1,t5_2qixk

5727160,0,t3_3tkri1,In my opinion it isnt that bad of a story overall but it was executed quite poorly. The Greatest Hunt in Gaming History ad campaign essentially set up gamers for disappointment as well.Personally I would have preferred a game that was absent of Cortana and was more about Chief exploring his humanity. I actually enjoyed the whole who is the machine thing they had going at the end of Halo . Bringing Cortana back so soon seemed like a disservice to her emotional exit in Halo .Sure you could argue Its not the same Cortana that we know and love but the thing is yeah it is. Its still the same entity. Shes just been changed just like humans change by knowledge and some construed higher purpose. Shes still Cortana to me which is why it annoys me to have her back so soon. It cheapens her sacrifice in Halo  to save Chief.It would be interesting to play Halo s campaign with my mind wiped of all the Hunt the Truth campaign details. There were aspects I certainly enjoyed even with it. Overall though while I dont think its a bad direction theyve gone in I would have vastly preferred a different more Chiefcentric journey.,halo,cx70dkg,1,t5_2qixk

5762770,0,t3_3u32go,Best way to get REQ points is Warzone unfortunately. about k per game.For REQ packsBronze has a chance of a permanent common. You can kill some of these by buying bronze though it isnt guaranteed. Mileage may vary. Personally I did this and had decent luck with usually two or three out of four having a permanent common. Silver costs about x as much as bronze so if for every  youre only getting one or two permanent with bronze just switch to silver as your luck aint cutting it.Silver is the one you should be buying most because it will kill common to rares and you are guaranteed  permanent. Since you can not get doubles of permanent unlocks wiping out as many of these with silvers will increase your chance of getting good stuff with gold.Look at it this way these numbers are made up but it will workSay you have  commons  uncommons  rare  ultra rare and  legendary permanents you havent gotten yet. If you buy Gold you are paying the highest amount k and you can get anything from the  uncommons  rare  ultra rare and  legendary pools. You have a  chance of getting something really good and  chance of hitting a legendary mind you with the true number of permanents and drop rate s your odds are much much worse than this.By buying silvers for half the price k you can weed out a lot of those uncommon and rares increasing the likelihood of popping out an ultra rare or Legendary when you eventually start buying gold. The unfortunate thing is silvers also give commons which there are a shitload of so narrowing the uncommonrare pool can be difficult. Getting rid of commons comes down to preference. Buy bronze and hope for a permanent common for cheap or buy silver to try and wipe them out. The price difference is pretty big about x as much. Thats up to you. Either way you should not be wasting req points on gold until you have a LOT of the uncommon and rare permanent reqs.And yes you should not waste your promo packs as hard as it may be not to open them. They have a much higher chance at the really good stuff.A much higher chance.Improve that chance by wiping out as much crap as possible first. ,halo,cxbfbdr,4,t5_2qixk

5852306,1,t1_cxmo5x7,I honestly would have waited on buying Halo  if I had simply known that there was no infection in the game. The most fun I had in Reach and Halo  was playing even just the base infection gametype let alone all the silly and goofy gametypes that spawned from within that. Getting  people together in a lobby to play infection variants has lead to some of the best moments I have ever had in a video game period. I have cried from laughter and screamed in fear from playing old school infectionSawJengaFatmanDuckHuntall the bullshit modesmaps I made myself.  I knew that no forge at launch would hold back from the fun customs that I expected but I still at least expected to be playing the base infection variant at launch. I got a few  player lobbies from the time Halo  launched and every single time was a disappointment for the entire group knowing all we could do was play capture the flag and slayer.,halo,cxmrkdd,0,t5_2qixk

5853168,0,t1_cxlxvcv,Sad to say but Recurve was created by . It has problems similar to Orion. Part of Orion works part of Orion does not. In a multiplayer arena shooter the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. Everything on the outside of the map the three bases red blue sniper rifle works. The verticality of the bow of the map is just kind of a mess of map geometry and there is no real incentive to go down there.If you take the shotgun off of the map that room becomes a lot less defendable. It takes a bit longer than  seconds to cross the entire map and I dont think that the size is the problem. heh The tank can go in a complete circle around the map. Problem is not where the tank is the problem is that the tank is very difficult to drive and is a lot more vulnerable with the increased movement speed. It is also incredibly easy to get out of a tank when it isnt being boarded which means people can hop out when it is being approached and kill a boarding player. Of all Halos multiplayer sandbox the tank seems to be the weapon most greatly affected by sprint. Because people can move quicker there needs to be more cover and different sight lines. Combine this with a tank that has not gotten any quicker and is more vulnerable to weapons fire and the thing is more of a death trap unless the driver has a gunner a spotter and all three are quite capable players. But really the whole thing is a Catch . You can have an all powerful tank dominate a map and watch players drop out of the game because the tank gunner has  kills in a  kill game and there are still  kills to go or you can have the tank be a bit more balanced and riskreward. ,halo,cxmvmu8,0,t5_2qixk

5863827,0,t1_cxo9hgw,Indeed. Im guessing the only reason i wouldnt is because they might think it would impact REQ sales and stuff but I think the playerbase would agree it would do the opposite.Not including them all simply decreases the amount of creativity and variance that map creators have which just leads to decreased custom gameforge health. Less players  less REQ purchases.Give players the tools they need to make great experiences for you and youll draw more players into the game and retain them.edit One more thing I wanted to add is that if more people are playing custom games instead of warzone maybe that says more about how fun warzone is and maybe they should change it up or work on it more ,halo,cxoa0ud,8,t5_2qixk

Theyve got protocol for operational command of AIs sure but its not explicitly written anywhere and can only be implied from what we see.  Being that smart AIs are so rare and we see them play a variety of roles its easy to assume that shipboard ones dont actually hold any operational authority but ultraspecialized ones like Cortana or BB have the capacity to divert assets to fulfill mission parameters even though they dont have a rank and are technically outside of the chain of command.Sloan doesnt actually factor into this because hes not UNSC.

5938652,0,t1_cxy29p0,I guess the joke was a little obscure. forerunner tank was a concept for a mission in Halo  that ended up being cut from development that they talk about in the developer commentary for Halo . I agree though another vehicle would be pretty cool. Im sure they would come up with something cool but I have this image in my head of a ghostwarthog analogue that has an EMP effect and a pretty decent antiarmor machine gun sort of like the one on the phaeton but that still leaves you fairly exposed. It would be an interesting antivehicle option that lets you take down bigger game but only if it isnt protected by a gunner or infantry. ,halo,cxy3608,12,t5_2qixk

I think  should have released a finished game in both this case and MCC and that while microtransactions are perfectly acceptable in my view in Free to play games paying for an AAA title and then paying for items which include extremely powerful weapons vehicles armour mods power ups further RP and XP boosts which means they will get a few more benefits is as close to pay to win as you can get in my view and unbalances the playing field. But only one playing field as it only affects warzone.  Im not upset about it it has little affect on my life and Ill never know if the guy who brings out  gauss hogs or some whiplashes and the best invisibility in quick succession has been grinding really well or has just forked out a load of money to do it.Also Id say that its unfortunate that the games industry is moving in this direction more and more. That wee episode that was brought up here where a child bought their dad fucking tonnes of req packs by accident is a perfect little anecdote to show that its more of a marketing ploy than an move to use subsidiary profits to release meaningful and interesting new content.

6050933,0,t1_cych1o1,I fucking hate this mindset.  Every project takes time.  Every project feature requires time to be budgeted.  Same goes for game Dev.  Warzone had the most time dedicated to it because it makes money.  This means that other features take the back seat and lose out on Dev time because they dont make money.  They make them good enough  rather than making them excellent  because they dont sell that feature as that makes them the least money.  If halo  arena had the Dev time and build quality that halo   reach did at the time then the warzone reqs would be alright.  But we are fucking Shafted.  That are cranking out req updates while game types Forge theatre lan Ui custom games btb and file share have all been omitted from launch. Yes btb was released but the maps are a fucking joke and if they are included in free Dlc counts thats Bullshit. Forge is great but lots of features are lacking and theyre are almost no game types.  Plus  needing a constant Internet connection to Forge is bs and causes lots of pain when there are hiccups.  The campaign was even lackluster and while it has high quality other aspects that the prior halos for right took a back seat to warzone Dev add they dont make money.  This should be common sense to realize for a company who has an ultimate goal to make money  and not innately please the fans as there assess assent really on the line anymore and can afford to cut lots of corners.  Eg Mcc.  Any other company that did that would be crucified.  Yet  now Mcc isnt even mentioned and I bet support will be dropped.  ,halo,cycs2sa,0,t5_2qixk

There are certainly more vehicle missions in Halo  than any other Halo game. However it sounds like this is your first time playing the Halo games or maybe just the stories and the feel of Halo s combat defines the rest of the series. Halo CE has a more sluggish floaty feeling.,halo,cyg44gp,2,t5_2qixk

6082237,0,t1_cygulk1,They are tolerable graphics but Halo  had to cut a lot of corners to get fps. We shouldnt be at that point yet. The hardware was less than the level of a midrange gaming laptop when it came out and has only dropped off since then. With less hardware refreshes consoles have to release much higher end than that. On top of that you could build a PC that ran circles around both next gen consoles for the same price at the time of release. ,halo,cygv2xa,2,t5_2qixk

6083213,0,t1_cygre0t,Well it should position you slightly lower then where it thinks you should be the system is somewhat playing it safe since you cant lose ranks in this game.Its easy to gain ranks back to where you think you should be if your placed lower. But if you place diamond due to shear luck or whatever its practically impossible in the current system to lose ranks so the system is still working as intended by starting you slightly lower.For Team Slayer I was only placed into platinum  this time around after being diamond in preseason.

6093453,0,t1_cygsz3z,Hey thanks for the reply definitely not too late to join the party. Lots of people have brought that theory up and it does make sense but Im still hesitant to believe chief could drop the ball like that. While my initial question put the Ss vs the Ss it was also an attempt to figure out why Chief seemed so average in this game. I was thinking maybe it was that the s are actually super great but after reading the replies it seems to be more politics and theories like the one you brought up. My personal perspective of master chief before the confrontation from the previous games and some of the pre release media like the audio stuff on SoundCloud was that he was incredibly good and practically invincible. Just think how much stuff we have killed in this game playing as him. After halo  I was willing to accept his only weakness could be his emotional connection to cortana and through her him wondering about weather he was a machine and all that. So the only reason Id accept for him being crap in the instance of this fight was if it was due to one of these issues. So him not hurting Locke because he doesnt like hurting humans kind of fits. Also explains why blue team didnt just disable osiris and instead cheif just stayed behind to play a brief game of grab ass with locke. Still not happy Locke got a hit in though. Even if chief is holding back he still has super crazy reflexes and stuff. Sorry for the long reply!,halo,cyi9guz,1,t5_2qixk

Sometimes when I melee someone and we both shoot I shoot faster on my screen but i still die. Its certainly not a latency issue because my internet is fine for everything else and other games but the game updating on what actually happens never seems in sync to me.

Other games accomplish this by usually having a numerical value in the mmr corresponding to a rank like mmr is silver  for example. However in halo  you get paired up with your hidden mmr and your rank doesnt have much to do with it. I could be plat  but get paired with diamonds because Im doing good however i wont be diamond myself. Its very hard to put a skill value on someones rank I cant say if plat  means someone is average or gold  makes someone trash. All this together I believe onyxchampion are actually top ?

Its an inherent part of game development. Thats why all professional gaming league have rules against using such exploits. Professional players adhere to these rules because they dont want to get disqualified.This isnt akin to a collapsing stadium. Its akin to a team cheating and being penalized. has a ton of things to fix with this game. No doubt. But this isnt something that should have to be fixed for tourney play because tournament players know better... Naturally their focus has been on other things.

Slayer big team battle etc. Warzone is a v mix of PvP and PvE. Warzone assault is just PvP but its still v. It plays kinda like invasion from Reach. This is where most of the cards you get from req packs come into play. For req packs start with opening nothing but bronze until youve gotten everything available from those packs and then move onto silver then gold. Its the most cost efficient way of doing it. Although I know some people will just start with silver because youre guaranteed  permanent unlocks. Either way I would recommend not opening a gold pack until youve unlocked everything up through silver packs. ,halo,cz7jejj,1,t5_2qixk

Play Warzone BTB or get on Halolobbies and play custom Arena.  You already have plenty of options that dont include us having to be your meatbags.  And the main downside is fragmenting playlist populations.

6561845,0,t1_czxzipe,The population numbers are quite irrelevant. They were during the Holidays when thousands of new players just picked up the game. Team Doubles is most likely the last playlist theyre going to participate in when they have a brand new v playlist and the Halo staple which is Team Slayer. On top of that Its a playlist that requires the least amount of players which effectively doubles the population numbers if you want to compare it to Team SlayerTeam Arena. On top of that just because the numbers arent fantastic doesnt mean it has a weak backing. A ton of the Team Doubles players are dedicated and have enjoyed it for years. It pulls great numbers on Twitch when Team BeyondGB hosts tournaments and all of the pros enjoy it. It has been a favorite of mine for years and has literally created a friendship for me that will never end. Back in November of  I was in Study Hall and overheard a kid talking about Halo. I decided to chime in we exchanged GTs and have not only been playing Halo ever since but have been incredible friends since. We played Holiday Doubles  hours a day every possible day we could during the Holiday season. I truly hope it makes a comeback as I feel with some tweaks it would play fantastically in Halo .,halo,czy1sdb,4,t5_2qixk

6580945,0,t1_czzzzr8,And I would be willing to bet it ultimately comes back to the clients Internet connection.  For right or wrong Halo  is not terribly tolerant of high latency or packet loss and latencypacket loss spikes are not unheard of on shared connections like cable.   It may come down to people pestering their ISP until their connection is more consistent.  Weve all seen the numerous threads about lagging lately which are a direct result of people wanting the restrictions loosened up a bit...Because I was curious I whipped up a quick app that queries the Halo  API for total number of games in Arena or Warzone and total number of DNFs for those games.  Quick results from thatThe group I generally play with  players have a total of  Arena or Warzone games played with a combined total of  DNFs.  Two of those have TWC and end up counting for more than half of the DNFs.You alone have  DNFs in  games.  Not saying youre doing anything intentionally but their is very likely something you or your ISP and the others that are complaining of the same issues can do to remedy the situation.I have Comcast oh yay and a couple years ago I called them dozens of times over a few month period to resolve a very intermittent latency issue.  Since Halo  seems to be pickier than other games it might not be as noticeable of an issue as it was for me.,halo,d000us6,3,t5_2qixk

Good enough to hold your own in Diamond. Winning isnt everything. Honestly the only difference between regular arena and social slayer is that one is ranked and you tend to care about winning. But if youre stuck at a level you cant get out of that goes out the window in your mind and you just slay. So you get rekt so sometimes you wreck people. Its always going to be a tossup.

The augmentations were necessary for the IIs because the strength of the armor wasnt as advanced during the Spartan II program. ,halo,d0bhnfc,41,t5_2qixk

The difference between top players is so miniscule that you need to really outperform them consistently to move up that miniscule distance. Sorry thats just how math works. The other problem is if no one in your skill level or higher is available for matchmaking you cant gain points. Its a drawback of the ranking system.

For the most part I think thats the right thing to do and it appears to be working.I totally know what you mean though a lot of old players just like to blindly hate on the franchise after Bungie left because it seems cool.

Unless you were using a melee powerweapon the kind of feedback I always got as a player was more like I was slapping them then bashing them in a heavy suit with a gun.Now in s iterations on the other hand I really feel the impact of everything partially this is down to the animations and sound design.

There is no way around it we arent going to let you get out and roam the map to give you a chance to beat us we play to win just like everyone else. Its not just halo any competitive game would result in the same outcome if a highly skilled team faced randoms. If the spawns were more varied we would be unable to spawn camp and we would just dig into the garage to defend instead. And when we did that people would STILL complain about us cheating because we are camping roof with carbines not letting anyone get inside garage or camping openings with gungeese and shotguns.

At this point it isnt s fault or Halo population problem the problem is that the Xbox Ones install base sucks compared to the PSs. It lost its that simple. Halo  is an exclusive on the losing console. The minute you actually take the time to understand that is when youll understand that Halo may not be as popular as it used to be but its still big. They also arent fucking losing money they are using portions of the REQ earnings for the tournaments therefore it can be assumed they have earned plenty to fund their own tournaments which spike viewership.

My personal issue with this is its a cheap way to inflate reqs to make it seem like theres a ton of customization when in reality a reachlike system with individual armor parts would provide much more variety.,halo,d0se3sn,1,t5_2qixk

6869340,0,t3_49pxor,Halo  gets my votemainly referring to the warthogs. The warthogs had a nice bounce to them and driving them felt the most fluid out of the whole series. From Halo  through Halo  the vehicles felt too rigid. They had almost no slide to them and didnt really take any finesse to drive. Halo  feels the closest to Halo  in terms of driving and so I praise it in that area.That said I dont like how the ghost handles in Halo . Changing directions means slowing to a crawl because the acceleration is very poor.,halo,d0uy8jg,1,t5_2qixk

If loading data from servers is why the rec menu is so laggy why would they dynamically populate the rec menu when they could have let it be local and asynchronously check rec purchases vs the server.

6904780,0,t1_d0ymq7a,Thats just the nature of playing a game with a fairly high skillcap that has been out for  years. Although the mechanics change with each game the fundamentals remain similar enough that if you were decent to good at one of the previous games chances are you can at least shoot straight in the others and have a general understanding of what to do. Someone brand new to Halo not only struggles with aiming and hitting shots but also knowing what to do and will make basic mechanical errors like walking into walls getting stuck on cornerswalls missing jumps falling off the map missing melees chasing into grenades standing still when sniping not strafing sprinting into gunfights throwing missed grenades instead of shooting challenging fights you know you cant win instead of staying alive giving up positioning to chase kills and the list could go on but you get the point. ,halo,d0yz5lp,2,t5_2qixk

6905883,0,t3_4ab26y,First of all lets make this part clear vgchartz does not track digital sales. So that that . million number for H is actually higher. Comparing it to games that were sold physical only while Reach and H were it wasnt made available till months after the games release means more people went physical than digital. is completely disingenuous. Im not saying that H is selling around  million and that its not losing popularity but it not doing as bad as youre trying say. Now Im going to give my reasons why Halo is losing popularity.  XBs reveal Lets be honest after that horrible plan of the XB having to be always connected to the internet and the no used games Xbox lost alot of customers. With those lost of customers that means the loss of potential H sales.  Track Record  With Hs horrible reception and the thing that MCC is people probably lost confidence for the next Halo game. Its no surprise this would happen after these two games.  Lack of featurecontent  The lack of splitscreen LAN offline custom games definitely lost some people. And then with the delays of gametypes forge and social playlists also put off from purchasing the game. CompetitionLook at the competition for HReach compared to what H has to deal with. There wasnt really any quality games to compete against H and Reach in their and Cod was only starting to pick up pace. Halo  has to deal with with other games like the train that is Cod Fifa GTA V Destiny Fallout ect. People have more of a choice now and that list is going to keep on growing.  Ending of a Trilogy Halo s story ended in a way where alot of people think that the series should be over. It had the perfect ending a people wanted it to end there and be tainted so this probably also included in the drop of sales. Well probably see the same thing happen with GoW .  End of a GenerationIt used to be that people would buy a console because of the exclusives and were cheaper and easier to deal with then a PC. That was back then but now in this generation we have peopleeven middle schoolers building PCs that are cheaper in the long run and can do much more. So another loss of an xbox sell with another loss of an H sale.  Halos long run as a seriesHalo has been around for  years now. Thats a long time and people are probably getting burnt out and moving on from the series. All trends and fads eventually die and change. It happens in everything like social media tv music fashion sports ect. And you can say But X game is still going strong so why cant Halo? but those games are an exception. And even then they will eventually die out like everything else and something else will come and take its place. Thats just how the world works. But Like I said before its popularity might have dropped but not as much as you think.,halo,d0z3npg,0,t5_2qixk

I personally think that the Mantis should be very overpowered because thats the whole point. If we had a perfectly balanced vehicle it would be useless. The entire essence of it is a very overpowered. The gameplay should reflect the fact that the Mantis is the best war machine the UNSC has to offer.

7039833,0,t1_d1e0c3w,Theres two ways to look at it  Say you make like an average american k a year.  That means an hour of your time is worth about  in the job market.  So if you only get  gold packs in  hours it would be a better use of your time to spend   hours of your time on the package with  gold packs.  The other way to look at it is that a video game is entertainment meaning the longer you stay entertained for in this case  the more bang for your buck you got from the purchase.  Therefore you would want the grind to take as long as possible so your  game purchase provides the maximum value of hour of entertainment.  Obviously as a working man with little time to play I have had to much time to think about this every time i open a shitty visor emblem or my third jump master armor variant.EDIT my income numbers may be off a bit its just an example,halo,d1eblap,4,t5_2qixk

7066565,0,t3_4cdjao,Here is how I see it The individuals want to play some social after a long day and just run in a straight line and shoot. Just some relaxing halo. The teams want to play social to take a break from the high octaine stress that comes with playing competitively. That doesnt mean they are going to lose their skills or stop talking to one another. What a lot of you are saying is that you want a playlist where noone is allowed to talk to one another or be in a party but still have  v . Because thats the only way its going to happen and I find it unlikely this will come to fruition. It is social so it doesnt matter if you win or lose on paper but you dont want to lose in social. The average skill especially recently has dropped as there are looser skill requirements for teams to match up in social. This means you will inevitably be paired up with sweaty kids. and as a sweaty kid I can tell you that my team and I are not elbows on knees trying to play social. Were laid back feet on desk talking about what ever and giving call outs as we see them in a calm chill manner.

All of these are opinions even if I present them as facts and I encourage people to reason and make me see their side and maybe change my own opinions. I think Halo s strongest point was Fireteam Osiris and would love to see more of them. Halo Reachs Firefight never felt near as good as ODSTs as the customization sandbox and general feel took away so much of what made ODSTs firefight unique and fun to playHalo s campaign is not that good as the level design and flow falls apart as soon as Metropolis ends due largely to the design philosophy changing so drastically following Halo CEs success I played through all of the campaign on normal no skulls and was thoroughly not having fun for most of the gameThe Flood was an interesting enemy that deserves to come back in at least a minor capacity even if the surprise of their existence is gone completely that does not mean they need to vanish. Halo  was an overall satisfying and entertaining game and I was extremely happy with the multiplayer and how it played despite the loadout system making the sandbox feel bland. Halo Reach had an awful story despite strong level design as the characters were not remotely interesting or endearing and their deaths left no real impact on me since they felt like bricks in power armor. Im sure theres a ton more but this covers most of it for now. ,halo,d1jv5k3,2,t5_2qixk

7111398,0,t3_4ab26y,Aware this is old just been linked to it by someone.Ive come to my conclusion as a long time fan now  this just isnt a very good game. Yes it has some nice core mechanics and better visuals than . Yes it has its moments. But fundamentally it is a boring game  of the time and I find myself playing it purely for req packs which is why Im taking a break from it. I dont even use them because I know Ill get spawn killed with my sniper or boarded easily in whatever vehicles I use.Then there is the negatives the worst campaign story in the series the absurd lack of features that made me regret buying a Halo game on release for the first time the dishonesty of the development process by  and their advertising the crappy spawns the way the game feels at times like little more than a twitch shooting Battlefieldinspace impersonator especially in Warzone the stripping away of all the little things that gave these games their identity the godawful physics the grenades the radar the death of vehicle play the obsession with pro gameplay the inconsistency in damage caused by various weapons and the complete dominance of midrange loadout weapons  who am I kidding the complete dominance of the BR and DMR. Im aware the BR has been dominant in every game its been in bar  but its even less satisfying now because of how quick the kills are and how easily it destroys vehicles.Was being kind on the game not long ago but basically done with it for a bit now. I think this has torpedoed the series as a major player. I wish  had stopped with  and gone out on a high singleplayer wise at least.Thanks for posting this I had no idea the figures were this bad and it shows just how the series is dying now.,halo,d1mgqa9,1,t5_2qixk

7145735,1,t1_d1q3wb3,Theres a reason Halo will live on forever as one of the greatest first person shooter franchises ever or at the very least one of the pillars the genre was built on.Yes the game was accessible to the casual fan but what Bungie created in terms of community and game experience crafted the cult like following and overwhelming critical acclaim every game franchise aspires to achieve. Its a shame weve regressed so far since then...the missed opportunity especially in this day and age where technology is only more ingrained in the culture. Id expect VR heatmap viewing  spectator abilities through the Halo website by now  or at least that being the next evolution  yet here we are without the ability to even see postgame medals IN THE FUCKING GAME. Gold standard is right and were sitting here getting shit on but its cool because REQ packs are awesome were getting free content and Firefight comes soon...The cognitive dissonance it takes to be unable to separate Halo  is good and Halo CE will be argued as one of the greatest games of all time and why that is and how we should expect the next games to follow suit astounds me  especially when the features that elevated those first games to such a level and the progression that existed from one game to another were sitting right there in front of  to utilize but they decided to strip out a whole host of those pivotal experiences instead of using them.Ill never understand it and Im fine sitting here getting pooped on by downvotes whenever I point it out. Its the least I owe the glory that was Bungie.net. ,halo,d1qe8cd,-2,t5_2qixk

7223680,0,t3_4ed8zr,KD in Halo  is different in terms of a general KD and the big KDA they implemented. KD is harder to increase but easier to decrease as a ratio because it takes more to make the ratio increase than it does to decrease as you kill and die more. If you sit at a solid . for example you need to get at least  kills for every  death. Unless this happens your average goes down until you break that cycle. The more you die the more weight this has on changing your KD negatively. KDA has  positive stats and one negative stat in terms of what will increase kills and assists versus what will decrease deaths the ratio. You dont need as many kills as long as you passively increase assists and with two positive elements influencing the ratio its far easier to keep it more positive than straight KD which is one positive and one negative.,halo,d1za11s,2,t5_2qixk

Also fighting in the cafeteria! Was this mission memorable to you? First Halo level ever so in that way yes it was. Still is the only time you fight in a cramped human ship environment. The Infinity in  doesnt really have the same feel as the hallways were HUGE. Also I always thought being about to jump through the glass at the escape pod doors to be really funny. Like here   Its a simple thing like someone thought Its glass its see through and a small window no reason to put a boundary there.Overrated underrated or got the praise it deserved? I think it got the right amount of praise.How does this mission stack up against later missions? Better than The Library or Cortana.Definitely do this as a weekly thing.

No QampA at PAX no HaloFest and no more episodes of The Sprint.

All throughout Halo s development the design teams kept coming back to Make it accessible then they put a huge amount of storyline content behind a gate and provided no other way to access that content through exposition and such to the players who neglected or were otherwise unable to access that content. Hell even high up people who worked on Halo under Bungie are complaining about this issue example  The problems not the lore its how its presented and consumed which is inaccessible sadly. ,halo,d2lx885,3,t5_2qixk

The thing is that sports are just another type of game. We all kid of understand this which is why governments were okay with adding nonsports to the program designed for athletes. The issue is they are doing it backwards. They should have a system by which all competitive games sport or otherwise that are able to have a living made off of them are classified under one system like the P visas without excluding things because they dont fit into previous neat boxes of understanding.,halo,d2so88x,2,t5_2qixk

How much longer until oddball is in matchmaking? Wheres one sided objectives? It took forever to get Grifball and we are now just getting infection.   They highlight game types that have  been in halo regularly as content drops.  They focused heavily on the competitive nature of halo and warzone.  Granted warzone is an insane upgrade and I love all the variety in weapons.  I love  and halo but giving them constructive criticism isnt a bad thing.    Hopefully they correct this with halo .   I know quite a few people who stopped playing because the variety in arena was so low.  Not to mention the already sour taste people still have from MCC.   I love halo and will continue to do so dont get me wrong. ,halo,d2w90qg,1,t5_2qixk

7550648,0,t3_4ipz3p,Firstly I want the Social unranked playlists to not affect my WL ratio. This way Im able to get more enjoyment out of the playlists because Im no longer focused on winning. Alternatively keep Ranked and Social WL ratios seperate. Secondly while it would be nice to have larger fireteam counts for the Social playlists.  may have restricted this to prevent people from boosting RP and XP. The solution would be to reduce or completely remove RP and XP rewards from Social playlists or to leave it how it currently is with smaller fireteam counts. In terms of what Social is. Social is currently a hidden ranked playlist that has a more relaxed matchmaking system.Here is what I think the playlists should look likeRANKED Official HWC Playlist Team Slayer Team Objective Breakout Swat Free For All Team Doubles Once the ForgeHub v Competition has been completed the best maps plus other maps from the community will be given to  to create a playlist.

I use to just roll my eyes and keep going while they tried to shoot me a couple of times or whatever but now Im at the point where the game has been out for so long they should understand Halo is a team game and the kill counts for the team so when they try to shoot me I just let them kill me and hope for a boot option or make it a point to try and mop up a few of their kills if it isnt out of my way during the match.,halo,d367sft,2,t5_2qixk

For example on counter strike youll see player ADing so quickly making their head really difficult to hit or shoulder peaking angles.

Its super frustrating having someone board and just hang out on a ScorpionWraith with no recourse. Shooting a wall or rock next to you for splash damage doesnt work. In previous games you had to melee a few times before you could plant a grenade... IF you had one. That gave the driver time to hop out and fight or teammates could shoot them off. The melee hits hurt their Spartans shield until they got out. Now? IF you get the prompt to board cue ScorpionWraith surfing while taking little to no explosive damage.,halo,d3cw9ma,2,t5_2qixk

I think if I were to get confused about anything it would be not having Advanced Sensors in Arena but even that doesnt happen.I appreciate that a lot of work went into this and that you described each of the sights and such very well but if all youre trying to say is people should only use default sights because they might get confused thats definitely something that varies from person to person.

Even if the changes are just take it or leave it from a balance standpoint the fact that they are new and dont have any glaring imbalances means that theyre a net positive in my book. The one exception to me is the hydra buff. The buff to short range utility is great but the absurd new lock on speed takes it too far considering how much ammo and range the thing has. You basically have to run away immediately when you see it now because it can kill you even while youre actively shooting the hydra user.,halo,d3wo394,2,t5_2qixk

Some pieces dont even look they are meant to protect the Spartan wearing it as the armor leaves key areas abdomen groin wide open to plasmaballistic fire or they just dont look like they have enough titanium Pls no bully if I am wrong on the material surrounding the wearer.

Dual wielding deployables detachable turrets hitscan jetpacks movement based invisibility and holograms are not nearly as gamechanging as altering combat and movement. Before combat and movement were on the same playingfield now its completely different combat and movement are separated meaning you play the game completely different and have completely different maps. Instead they should have just increased the base walking speed not used sprint. Putting your gun down is pointless and removes halos game play identity.

Since Bravo interacted a lot in the threads people took to referring to him directly on issuessuggestions they had. Eventually people were asking him about so much stuff the subreddit kind of came up with its own meme saying BravoPls Bravo please after literally everything they posted.

If their head is glowing shoot it for a headshot to finish them off.Shoot the glowing shoulders on Knights to break open their back armor then shoot them in the glowing orb on the back. Sometimes they roar. Shoot them in the face when they do that.Warden weak points are the glowing bit on their back.Phaeton weak points are the glowing orb on their bottom.Generally speaking when firing at an enemy look at your hit markers  the little lines that pop off of your reticle when you hit something.

These rounds are not harder than any other your team just needs to be smart enough to adapt how they approach it. If youre with randoms plug your mic in and tell all those shitheads to target the same thing.

The social component is a ONE of the reasons that make the game great. People dont like playing onesided or uneven matches. People dont like to have to go through sites systems and tools external to the game in order to have a pleasentfunbalanced experience. When it happens people are less likely to be social.

The rockets easily kill spartans up close and since the boarding mechanics are OP most spartans will rush you.  Rule  Watch every corner. Dont pass the corners on the inside  make a long turn a spartans cant hide behind a corner and easily board you. Rule  Never go around a corner without the rockets being reloaded. The chaingun is terrible so you must be able to rely on rockets in every encounter. If you had used the rockets instead of the stomp you would easily have killed him.

In fact the victims perspective due to latency would have likely shown the bubble shield activate about a ms after he had pulled the trigger if they actually happened at the same time. So the victim sees the enemy aims and shoots only to see his rocket blow up in his face. As the camera moves from first to third person when he dies hell see a bubble shield that wasnt there when he pulled the trigger. Hence the joke about breaking his controller. ,halo,d5m1owp,1,t5_2qixk

8365060,0,t1_d5mtoq8,Its because i doesnt have a unified artistic vision its outsourced to companies and independent artists all pulling in different directions and trying to outdo each other. Isaac Hannaford Robert amp Lorraine McLees Shi Kai Wang and a few unnamed others had a very unified vision and all worked towards their strengths. Each paying homage to realistic hardscifi in movies anime and literature as well as personal experience. One great example is Halos iconic guns come from Robert Mclees a man with experience with firearms. So he developed weapons he thought were practical but also fun and humorous to gun enthusiasts. His vision was so in tune with his craft the MAB turned out to be strikingly similar to the FN by sheer coincidence. His designs were in line with realistic firearms development at the time. Now notice how much pointless shit i tacks on to its weapons like why on earth does the BR and Shotgun in H and H have so much contours and buttons? Its because theyre designed by artists who dont even bother a google search or take futuristic design seriously enough. They just add shit to impress the execs and make it look cool. The awesome function first aesthetic everyone is missing is completely gone. They prefer to have human weaponry look like ministarships.Mind i isnt all bad they aint the devil in my eyes. But its seriously frustrating especially as an artist to see Halo lose one of its strongest selling points and shrink into the abyss of overrendered hyperstylized future aesthetic thats plaguing the Military Scifi genre. ,halo,d5n6mpw,16,t5_2qixk

8504621,0,t1_d64kcsm,For some reason  decided instead of removing hitmarkers just to make them the quietest sound in the game. If nothing is going on because no one knows where anyone is and you throw a nade in a random direction you can hear the hitmarker after it blows up. And boom! you now know where the opponent is even though you shouldnt. As for weapon grenading the mechanics are there but for some reason  wanted to move the weapons ever so slightly. Sometimes its fixed sometimes its not. And the thing is for the nade tricks you stand in a specific spot and line up your reticle with the wall on the pixel so that rockets will be naded up to top green on damnation. The thing is if theyre moved  pixel the nade trick wont work and even worse you cant even come up with a ducktape solution because now in order to get the rockets up to top green your reticle has to be in open space touching no walls so theres nothing you can use on your screen to get your reticle in the pixel perfect position. halo mcc ce is really just an inferior version. It should only be played as a last resort. Heck  controllers and an og xbox is like  ce is . an xbone is    for mcc   for a controller. plus the other team needs one too.

8547888,0,t3_4wr2ok,Id love to see a return to Chief becoming a more fleshed out character in Halo  like he was starting to become in Halo . However as Frank OConnor said in a TIME interview  feels the need to balance out expectations of people who want a more silent Chief because that is what they like and a Chief like that from the expanded universe people have wanted. Thats certainly understandable but going one way one game and then grinding to a halt the next isnt going to help and I think a lot of people saw that in Halo . Personally I felt Chief in Halo  was the best of both worlds. He wasnt a chatterbox by any stretch of the imagination yet we also got to see him struggle with things beyond what he is used to with Cortanas rampancy the Didacts seemingly unstoppable nature the Librarians infodump on the humanForerunner war and Del Rios orders just to name a few. ,halo,d6a23b5,2,t5_2qixk

Along the way Master Chief receives a vision from Cortana saying that Meridian will be next. Blue Team decides to go to Meridian without permission.Mission  Fireteam Osiris are sent to Meridian to find Blue Team and bring them back. They kill a lot of Prometheans along the way.Mission  Fireteam Osiris are still looking for Blue Team. This time they dont kill anything. They find out the Governor of the colony is an AI.Mission  Fireteam Osiris finds Blue Team Locke attempts to stop them while everyone else stands back and watches. Blue Team escapes onto a bigass Forerunner...bird thing. The Guardian bird thing prepares to slip space jump so Osiris runs away while the planet evacuates.Mission  Guardian takes Blue Team to Genesis Cortana tells them shes not dead.

Cortana decides fuck this kills Warden Eternal and traps Blue Team in a cryptum so she can proceed with saving the galaxy without distractions.Mission  Fireteam Osiris keeps looking for Blue Team. Turns out Cortana has been recruiting AI around the Galaxy in order to make them immortal and give them control of the Guardians to protect the Galaxy.Mission  Fireteam Osiris finds the Cryptum and is like no.

They return to Sanghelios...for some reason. Cortana begins deploying Guardians across the Galaxy and the Infinity runs away.Review Essentially the only thing that happens is Cortana activates Guardians and recruits AI.

Having the main threat of your game be so vague that the only thing they are demonstrated doing is nonlethal makes your threat pathetic unless you explain that the continued use of the pulses gradually rips apart its target for example. They showed it was vague now tell. In the thing they show the thing assimilate then they explain what had happened specifically. You are excusing bad storytelling with mystery. Having a single few lines with halsey would have dramatically improved this aspect of the campaign but as it stands many find the guardians lame why do you think that is?

Mjolnir could only do so much. So to answer your question about how the different generations of Spartans compare we can look at episode  of Spartan ops. Thorne So you dont think were capable of being Spartans? Halsey Perhaps some of you more than others. S IVs may have more advanced equipment but most cant compete with a II. Some may be stronger than others in terms of genetics and psychology. Thats also why Six is on par with Chief in terms of lethality. He was just a random genetic gold mine born a little too late to have been an S II. But you also cant ignore the training IIs and IIIs went through.

8761406,0,t1_d70nwi6,I agree with this line of questioning. Talking to other Forgers for months about this there came a general consensus as to how the process may have been handled. Out of many games that could have been considered several factors must have played a part in them being picked. Is the map confusing and does it require explanation? The best map could be confusing and requiring instruction. Its known that most players know nothing of Customs and dont have the ability to instantly adapt to new and potentially wacky map concepts. This goes double for gametypes since each MiniGame is unique and plays differently from even adjusted Custom Game matches.Are there player containment issues? Can you break the map or otherwise circumvent restrictions regarding the playable area of the map even by accident. This also applies to the minigames mechanics since players are unpredictable and can come up with unique ways to break the intended gameplay.Perhaps a top priority how stable is the map regarding JIP and quitingleaving and do any parts of the map not function when either of these instances occur. Many great games break when someone lags out quits or joins in progress because of Forge scripting instability gametype instability ex the many Infection glitches or heavy usage of Forge resources.Perhaps most important how quickly and efficiently can the mapgametype be adjusted to suit the playlist requirements. Almost every mapgametype was adjusted by  in some way even after the Forgers themselves put in much work to get the mapsgametypes ready. A simple example is the Tank game where in Customs you can play with well over  persons but in Action Sack are limited to  or less players.A simple thought experiment using ideas like this and others would eliminate most great content from being considered. Then again perhaps they kept a second batch of mapsgametypes for whenever they decide to refresh the playlist.,halo,d70u4wz,4,t5_2qixk

However there is also European pro league which I think is also played on Wednesdays and Thursdays. European players are obviously very good players but not quite on par with top NA teams.The Wednesday matches of EU pro league are streamed on twitch.tvhalo but the second day has no official stream. Community memberHalo caster Onset will be streaming those matches at twitch.tvOnset though. Both days of North American pro league and open circuit too if I remember correctly are streamed at twitch.tvHalo. It is also worth noting that the spectator mode is kind of broken so the shots often times look like they dont hit the target even though they actually hit.Pros are streaming their scrims and other stuff on Twitch so check that out if youre interested.

Some were outside facing the armory killing anyone there. Some sat in the back caves killing anyone there and then guys sat closer to the armory to shoot down any Banshees or Wasps.

Aim assist is the effect where the reticle sticks to a target magnetism is where the bullet will hit the target if the reticule is within a certain distance.Second as to why its in the game is because its in the console version. The PC version is a port and in general is intended as more of a tool for forgers rather than a full version of the game.

9078941,0,t1_d834ggh,Thats one of the things that bugged me so much in Reach.  I dont know why Bungie went and set a precedent for spartans all having differently coloured armours in the canon particularly when before then it had been an established idea that they all looked similar.What happened to the idea of all the SIIs being hard to tell apart?  Look at the damn Package in Halo Legends what the hell happened there??  Youd have to be completely blind not to tell them apart theyre all funky colours and wearing different suits ffs.It was so much more interesting when Spartans were seen almost as myths or stories.  The idea of a single faceless human or identical fireteam just handing it straight back to the overwhelmingly strong covenant.  The idea that the general populace knew next to nothing about them and that there were only rumours before the program was made public.That mystery is a massive part of the appeal to me.  So I really wasnt happy when Bungie went off the rails with it.  Im just as annoyed with i too as they could have retconned it if they wanted to.  But instead they went with it and now its evolved into what we have now.,halo,d8353k7,13,t5_2qixk

Im trying to come around to it. I was in denial now Im accepting Halo . Doesnt mean I love the game it just means that Ill be willing to accept it for what it is and hope to god  does better next time. The guy who wrote Halo ? Chris Schlerf? Hes awesome. I hope he comes back in some way shape or form. Maybe Brian Reed isnt all bad. But for the story sake I wouldnt trust him with a mainline Halo game. The mainline Halo games are VERY important arguably more important than the books since must people get the story from the game than the books and its more accessible.

9113700,0,t3_5532k1,First I would get rid of the Fireteams for the two protagonists. They dont do anything for the story and just serve to distract from Locke and Chief. I would make the game all about Chiefs loneliness and deteriorating mental state. I would start the game with a Chief mission something reminding him of his past with Cortana. He would see a vision of Cortana hinting at her survival and then go rogue in a mad dash to find her. Enter Locke an O.N.I. Operative tasked with bringing in the Chief using any means necessary. The game would cut between Chief searching for Cortana and continuing to have visions and Locke following his footsteps. About half way through the game the two would fight after Chief refuses to come in. Locke would smash Chiefs visor revealing the eyes of a crazed and desperate man. Chief then makes his escape. From that point on Locke knows Chief wont be taken in he must be taken out and he enlists the help of the Arbiter to help him to do so and Chief continues his search for Cortana. It would either end with Chief being crazy and hallucinated all the visions and being killed by Locke or Chief being right and Cortana being alive but evil and manipulating Chief to do her bidding throughout the entire game. It depends if you want another game with Chief or you want the slate of old characters wiped clean.,halo,d87bilz,1,t5_2qixk

9271654,0,t1_d8r7puw,Sounds like it will be initially seems like theyre going to release it temporally then make some changes based on player feedback and hopefully it will become a permanent playlist after that. I kinda understand why they do rotational playlist though. They want to make sure each playlist is populated enough to find consistent matches with good connections. Objective was my favorite playlist back in H it was my first  but it almost always had about th the population of slayer and was typically far less popular than other playlist. If my memory is correct there are  arena playlist plus one rotational then  warzone play list. So the population is already split  ways. It would split even more if you count players in the campaign and players in custom gamesforge. I see people requesting permanent snipers multi team fiesta social slayer social arena objective turbo and probably a few others Im forgetting about. No matter what they add someone will be dissappointed and if they add everything then some players would have trouble finding matches. ,halo,d8r8z30,1,t5_2qixk

One of the best levels for this is Halo s The Covenant in the battle with the two scarabs if you get in the side seat of a hornet they will fly you over the scarab where you can get out and drop onto it and kill it.  But it does not end there when the scarabs core is destroyed they will come back if they are still alive and land on the front of the scarab for you and fly you out of there.

I lived through that and I know that people who bitch the loudest are often proven to be wrong. When you have a poll that is selfselecting the results are useless. But you can guarantee all the the people who hate the SA voted and told their friends to vote.  They complained about equipment and armor abilities too. And I read every day on here how we need a Halo  anniversary edition to save the franchise. The bottom line is that Im just tired of hearing people layer their judgements about this particular game on the entire franchise. Usually they are malcontents trolls or people who have a very short history with Halo. Whatever the case may be the game is fine. The next game will be fine and so on and so forth.

9546768,0,t1_d9ohs49,I said that everything that  did is garbage.  This is why the fanbase and the online numbers are failing.  This is why halo reach just  months ago had almost double the numbers online that halo  did.  This is why reach and  are still in MLG sports and halo  is not. I am sorry you are a fanboy and masturbate to halo .  I am sorry that you and your  year old friends are getting triggered by someone who points out the obvious.  Also since you are a stickler for detail and since you clearly looked it up yourself the halo  handgun shoots EXACTLY the same ammo as the halo .  .xmm M SemiArmorPiercing HighExplosive.    IT is NOT hollow point.  Halo has NEVER EVER EVER used hollow points.  It is armor piercing so it is of course not hollow point.   makes these games and puts tons of inconsitencies in them because they are literally rinse and repeating the exact same code for each game with just a graphics upgrade.  Halo has always been about the lore with the multiplayer being secondary and  has reversed that.  They have been trying super hard to get it MLG status so they concentrate on multiplayer instead.  Bungie did not do this.  THey made an amazing game and an amazing multiplayer as well.  COD also just focuses on multiplayer this is why their campaigns have sucked ass for the last  years.   does not pay attention to detail.  When devs do not care about the game and are just using it as a cash grab like  is there are tons of inconsistencies and it ruins immersion.  True fans of the game all agree that the series should have stopped at halo .  It is now just being made to make money.  Its like all the star wars movies.  They are just cash grabs.  Lack of detail and a bad story with inconsistencies make for a bad product.  The original image just showed me one more reason not to ever play halo .,halo,d9pu47i,1,t5_2qixk

Or any other  employee when people bring up the legitimate issues or feelings?  It is nothing more than We understand trust us we are upset to..  There is no substance nothing concrete no steps forward nothing.   clearly rationalizes any negativity with it being the vocal minority  however take a look at how many people are left playing the game the silent majority have also left.

9703279,0,t1_da940zt,gt Combat Evolved gives you no context whatsoever for the setting why the Covenant is an enemy etc. Halo  gives no explaination for how the Chief and Johnson are suddenly back at Earth. Halo  doesnt explain how Thel Miranda and Johnson made it back to Earth before the Chief or why he jumped out of the keyship.CE literally starts off by stating that you just left Reach trying to escape the Covenant. Also you dont need to know why the Covenant and UNSC are at war to understand the story just that they are. Halo  doesnt explain how Chief and Johnson are back on Earth but we did know that Chief left the Halo Ring on a Longsword. Johnsons escape isnt explained but its not hard to assume he got off the ring in a similar fasion to Chief. As for Chief jumping out of the Keyship thats such a minor detail that doesnt have any impact on the rest of the game so Id say it doesnt make the story any harder to understand for nonbook readers.gt Nope. Not true. Keyes Johnson Jenkins Bisenti Thel Vadamee the Prophet of Truth Tartarus and Lord Hood were all also first introduced in a novel before they appeared in a game.I admit that I forgot to add in Keyes but I edited that in pretty much immediately after I posted. As for Johnson hes not really a character until Halo  in the games and his role in FoR was very small. Jenkins and Bisenti arent even relevant to the games at all aside from being marines in Johnsons squad. Hell Bisenti isnt even named in the game to begin with. Thel Vadamee is mentioned in the books before Halo  but he isnt introduced fully until the game itself. Similarly in the MCU Doctor Strange was first mentioned in the Winter Soldier but he wasnt introduced until his movie. As for Truth Tartarus and Hood I admit that I forgot about their appearances in the books but even then their appearances arent unexplained in the games.,halo,da94y0u,1,t5_2qixk

9723447,0,t3_5e7byt,No. no. no.I initially bought my Xbox One to for Halo and I was in the same situation as you and to be honest I would have saved my money. I will say some good things though Halo  is hands down one of the smoothest experiences I have ever played. Finding games and getting into them is really seamless and this game has a great level of polish when it comes to the little details. The graphics are absolutely stunning and the  fps really makes this game feel buttery. However this is a GAME polish is great and the potential that Halo  is immense but it is squandered at every single turn. They got rid of  for a MOBAesqued tiered system that essentially resets every couple of months. So in turn ranks mean literally nothing and even if you climbed up the ladder and you get to Onyx or Champion your search times increase exponentially. This is just the ranking system I havent even begun to speak about the meta of the game. In Halo  every gun is viable and there isnt a steady gameplay flow. Most games just boil down to rock paper scissors with what gun you have in each situation and that is if you dont get caught midsprint trying to change your position. I forgot to say that the aiming in this game is funky Halo  had a aim acceleration but Halo s aiming system doesnt make sense according to XiM I used to be a Halo Vet and I had a  in TS and Im sorry I cannot enjoy Halo . I uninstalled the game  months ago and came back because of the Anniversary Playlist but they botched that as well.Ill get downvoted to shit probably but as a guy that didnt have that type of money I would have saved it.,halo,dabmldl,1,t5_2qixk

9769870,0,t1_dah7si2,gt It most definitely does not have as expansive of a story as Halo  and Halo . Halo  had legitimate characters with real motivations.Okay if you count cortana and chief yes but thats one arc. And imo one arc does not make a story and it was way too personal and small for Halo imo. Other than that just about every other character has shallow roles and has such a small number of lines that I could count them on one hand. Like literally Palmer has one freakin line in the whole campaign. ONE! And its just one short sentence. Laskey has a handful of meaningless comments that do nothing to establish his past relationship with chiefYou get that in Forward Unto Dawn! And Del Rio is so generic and also has like  lines. He only becomes semi complex if you read through the Kilo Five trilogy.As for the Didact unless you read the Greg Bear novels he comes off as your run of the mill generic Destroy all Hoomans Alien overlord and the covenant went from being so complex and detailed in  back to being colorful aliens who you shoot at in . You literally only begin to get details about their new leadership in Spops.gtTanaka was on a planet as it was glassed. As such she has far more understanding of the people on Meridian than the others. This is conveyed in dialogue. Vale is a Sangheili expert. This is conveyed in dialogue.Yes through very forced expositionary dialogue. Nothing is demonstrated to us about how this is significantExcept for Vale since she has a few instances where its relevant to plot but its very shallow. I mean you really shouldnt try to argue that Halo  did good in depth story telling. Im sure everyone in this sub could go into detail as to why its not that great.As for Halo  man I could honestly spend paragraphs about it due to how much the games covered but Ill stick to one example for now. Again its seeming like you either played it and skipped cutscenes or forgot all about it much like CE. But pretty much  literally built the covenant from pink and purple aliens you shoot at to the hierarchical zealous religious alien pact that we know them to be. We literally learned how their government trials work within the first cutscene of the game and how harsh they dull out punishment to those they consider heretics we also learn more precisely how religiously they hold halo to be in Halo Prior it was suggested they thought it was a weapon in CE and that was about it. We also learn throughout the game how their leadership works a hierarchy of  prophets who seem to be more or less equal to one another although truth is easily demonstrated to be the most dominant of the three as seen through his scathing remarks towards Regret after his failed invasion of Earth. Each have their own personalities as well Truth the calm seemingly benevolent yet later demonstrated to be conniving leader Regret the pious aggressive and reckless prophet and Mercy another pious leader however admittedly hes more or less a tool to demonstrate Truths true colors later on in the campaign. Arbiters also pretty well developed too as we get to see him go from obedient religious warrior hungry for redemption through the path of the Arbiter to the enlightened soon to be Sangheili leader that he becomes after his meeting with the Gravemind and the struggles that go along with thatAnd OH YEAH! The Flood are also built in this campaign!And thats just literally one facet that Halo  delves deeper into the universe on its own.

9793872,0,t3_5fhf0r,Books The Fall of Reach preferably the book not the animated series is a great introduction to the series Id  start with that. Then if you like the authors style and dont mind having Halo CE kind of spoiled for you Id go with First Strike after that because it builds on Cortana and Master Chiefs relationship. Here is a link to rhalostorys recommended literature reading order Contrary to the reading order listed there Id probably follow up The Fall of Reach with Contact Harvest Cole Protocol the Cryptum trilogy or Evolutions as they wont really spoil any of the games for you and expand the universe but at the same time they wont add a ton to Halo  either. ampnbspComics I havent read any of the comics so I cant really speak to them and Ill leave that to others to comment on. List of comics can be found in the link I posted in the book section.ampnbspMovies The seriesmovie Forward Unto Dawn is probably worth watching at some point as its pretty well made but it only ties in to Halo  in a minor way like side character development and wont really effect your interpretation of the Halo  plot. Halo Nightfall gives you background on Locke one of the major characters in Halo  but you dont need to watch this and I think the consensus is that this is lower quality than Forward Unto Dawn. The animated version of The Fall of Reach isnt terrible but pretty much everyone who read the book was disappointed by its scope and the animation style isnt for everyone. If you dont plan on reading the book though this is better than nothing. ampnbspPodcasts Hunt the Truth HtT is the ad campaign that lead up to Halo  and it is fantastic in my opinion. Incredible voice acting throughout and good plots although I prefer season  to season . Unfortunately it doesnt really relate to the campaign as much as we were all hoping so the reception of Halo  and HtT season  were both kind of soured by that... Either way season  will give you a great background into ONI the Halo universes version of like the CIAFBINSA Master Chief and the Spartan program. Season  deals with the lead up to some of the events in Halo  but not with anything that you wont figure out right away by playing the game.ampnbspGames Like everyone else here is saying if you can get MCC at some point Id highly recommend it. You can always lower the difficulty and power through it for the plot if you want or I guess watch the cut scenes on youtube but that kind of cheapens the journey. Halo  probably has the most direct impact on the events of Halo  but the other three core games have entertaining campaigns and really help to build the universe. ampnbspYou can probably play Halo  without any introduction to the universe but it couldnt hurt unless youre really itching to start playing the campaign. Let me know if you have any questions or want me to try and dig up some links or anything!,halo,dakb21i,6,t5_2qixk

9884919,0,t1_davpeqz,Quanitity isnt a subsittue for quality however. Personally I feel Mythos and Fractures are great additions to the story but Tales from Slipspace is mediocre with stories that range from not actually make anyhting clearer Dominion Splinter being all visuals and little actual story to being unncessary Fireteam Majestic Poker Night nuff said to being disappointing Knight Takes Bishop killing yet another character to make a new Spartan look badass. Hunting Party and Undefeated were good and both shed light on Atrioxs intelligence in the former and the latter being hopeful yet bittersweet. Even Smoke and Shadow was a good addition yet it along with a lot of the fiction is far removed from Halo s breaking of the setting that such a bar isnt high to clear. Envoy sounds promosing but it sounds like Halo s nonsense is going to rear its head in that story as well. Looking back at Escalation it seems that was used more as a dumping ground for story arcs and characters like the Didact to be shelved because evidently the Created arc took priority. ,halo,daw11c7,2,t5_2qixk

10018018,0,t3_5j2xio,Radar isnt useless the range is smaller but its extremely useful especially if youre above or below enemies. Map selection in ranked is limited because i is pretty tight about what gets in there.  If you want some map variety try playing Warzone BTB or the Custom Game Browser.  You can search by map on the Custom Games Browser.  Warzone is fun as shit!  BTB has larger maps.Youre probably seeing lopsided games because youre new and either being stomped or carried.  Solo players can get matched with randoms but at lower ranks it happens less.  Its also very easy to make a smurf account on the XB all you need is one Gold XBL account on an XB and you can make as many other accounts on that XB as you want.  So smurfing is pretty easy.  The BRDMRCarbine are all upgrades to the pistol you should be picking them up whenever you can.  Theres a reason that pro players do this.  The Halo  Carbine is one of my favorite Halo weps ever and is really good at cleaning up kills especially when youre getting help from teammates.Heres a guide I wrote for newer players.My advice is to find an active Spartan Company on rhaloplyers or the Waypoint recruitment forum and try out the rest of the playlists.  Remember to try out Warzone its fun as shit.

10078444,0,t3_5k2qro,Your OP makes it sound like youre upset by a bad connection system but your comments in the thread make it seem that you want a relaxed restriction of the skill based match making. Its a really tough position for . You mention Titanfall as having done a good job but if you pay attention to that sub youll notice that there are always people upset about how unbalanced the matchmaking is. Most games end up being blowouts because they have no skill based matchmaking in favor of quick queue times. Thats unfair and unfun to the people on the receiving end of it.Selectable data centers are nice but as somebody in Italy youre likely to lag if you were to choose something in the US or be matched into a US game with the current system. While you may see it as fair to you that you can get into games quicker theres people dealing with that lag that see it as unfair to them.As a games population dies off theres no scenario where they can be fair to everybody. Its not a matter of only caring about the US and being unfair to you. Its a matter of there being no way to be fair to everybody.

10129889,0,t3_5kv43i,I think is mistake was trying to depict specific events happening inside the game through trailers. Bungie typically built their trailers around the games thematic concepts andor isolated lore not experienced directly by the player. Noble Teams stepping into boots better left unfilled mission prior to ReachReachs against all odds tone Chief as a beacon of hope for humanityis lost in the end Starry Night with a random nonspecific battle setting the tone ODSTs are hardened badasses etc. etc.        Lets take a look at some of the Halo  trailers.   Live action launch. Id say this is the biggest offender. It shows us what happens on Meridian. Civilians are in peril Johns loyalty is up in the air Guardians are activating seemingly because of his presence theres two sides to the story John is declared dead and Locke hunts him down.      When the player lands on Meridian none of this plays out. Johns allegiance is never in question. The UNSC never once see him as a traitor. Everyone knows what the Guardians are and whos controlling them from the start. Infinity knows exactly why John went AWOL and Osiris is tasked with essentially telling John hes not emotionally equipped to deal with this and to sit it out on the bench. Theyre given this assignment before John can be associated with civilian casualties and called a traitor. The greatest hunt in gaming history is asking a few NPCs if they saw John pass through.     Chief being declared dead to protect his image doesnt make sense with the outcome of the events seen ingame. Everyone knows hes still on our side. It turns into a rescue mission almost immediately after. The impact of Meridians loss is never truly felt. In fact the Guardians devastation overall is mostly told to us instead of shown. Infinity says Six more colonies lost. and then moves on.     Now if that trailer had taken place on some other colony itd be slightly less misleading and more inline with Bungies approach. is thematic trailers also unfortunately focused on the wrong angle. Hunt the Truth LockeChief trailers that sniper bullet through Johns helmet TV spot Halo A bookends all chose to emphasize what turned out to be a very minor part of the game that ultimately lead to a drunken bar fight. They should have instead chosen to market Sanghelios Guardians OsirisBlue Teams past anything but the hunt.        ,halo,dbrxhop,6,t5_2qixk

10144033,0,t3_5l6z6r,There are a lot of things that on their own might not be problems but packed together in the game work poorly against the use of microphones.Party chat takes away the team communication and so does private chat. I think Halo  forced players to use game chat if they were in private.Then there is the age disparity between players. I think this is a less concrete idea because you will always have underage kids and preteens playing games no matter what the rating is but am actual T rating for a halo game rather than M can only contribute to the younger player base. Its just a way people feel I hate listening to kids screaming through headsets and I used to be one of them so maybe its karma.The mute all function is a total hunk of crap  of the time that I use it. I hit the button and yet still somebody yelling through kinect or a child or a domestic disturbance blares through my television despite muting all. I start a match and notice noises and voices being heard but no name indicators showing for who the culprit is. I open the list of players in the match and see the microphone icon by their names sound through the TV but no indication by the icon. When I hit X in game it continues to say mute all and never says unmute all as if it hasnt been pressed. Ive heard rumblings that users with a rd party chat app other than the XBL party system might avoid these settings in game making it difficult for other players to effectively mute them without going to their gamercards and actually muting their whole profile.Another problem is that with the customs browser you can join the game and have  people max and maybe  in the queue waiting to play and they are all using mics too in this scenario Im describing. How do you keep track of all these jerks making noise when the mute button is broken and there are kids crying and just this loud windy noise and then a Spanish guy reenacting General Hospital all at once. It is mind boggling to have to try and communicate with these people when at the end of match you move on because the fireteam system isnt always adequate.The lack of splitscreen might have had an impact on how we talk in game. It helps you have a buddy in the same room talking with you to grease the wheels when talking to strangers. The party up system isnt even there like in Halo  or Halo Reach. You cant preview every players armour anymore before the match to see who they are and say Hey thats cool! Hey how did you get that? Or even simpler reading someones name and seeing who they are. Halo  is very impersonal when it comes to communicating as players and it gets lonely. If none of my gatherings after a whole year of playing can describe this newer dynamic then honestly I dont know what will.,halo,dbtrs2w,1,t5_2qixk

10291202,0,t1_dcajyho,This is actually a very interesting point to bring up. In truth no Halo game regardless of the character you play as depicts the world exactly as they would experience it. For example the various shapes of Mjolnir helmets combined with the canonical features they each provide are not represented in gameplay. except for some minor changes in the H campaign Additionally consider that the Arbiter clearly had no visor and yet you view through his eyes shield strength and a motion tracker among the other HUD elements.Perhaps the best way to think of the Arbiter perspective specifically would be to say that Humans are able to comprehend a viewpoint based primarily on their own physiology so if Sangheili facial features would alter vision that is likely being ignored for the sake of gameplay.Edit this is purely speculative but it occurred to me that those Earth organisms with eye placement similar to Sangheili physiology are known to have a much wider area of vision than humans. Deer for example have in excess of  of vision around their head in order to see predators approaching from rear angles. So while I cannot state this as canon the location of their eyes does suggest a much wider area of vision than what Halo  displayed.,halo,dcakaqo,6,t5_2qixk

10326522,0,t3_5ntmcw,I dont think the problem is developers not knowing they need marines I think its devs not knowing that they dont need the Chief.The Master Chief had a great trilogy and has a colorful life in the expanded universe but he was a cog in a grander more relatable machine. Fans enjoy Halo Wars ODST Reach and the rest of the universe because they are strong and worthwhile without a single thread narrative. The MC Trilogy was too although itd be hard to prove that without somehow removing S which is impossible. But if the trilogy had some other glue to hold the narrative together like the other entries Reach in particular thered still be a cohesive world. Youd be exploring it through some other vehicle but itd still be worth exploring.Consider the bone chilling reveal of the Flood in CE. It works specifically because the found footage portrays a believable squad with color and character. You are just as invested in saving these four or fourteen or however many guys as you are in saving the planet the galaxy or the species.The parts Halo  did right were making Ancient Humans believable and interesting and worth investigating. What it did wrong was make Forerunners and Prometheans flat and boring. Theres exactly one Forerunner and hes been asleep doing NOTHING for eons. His entire thought process is Humans suck kill them all and has no one to argue against oppose him or ally with. His army is composed rimshot of literally copypasted humans that can be teleported anywhere anytime.Contrast that threat with Halos gold standard The Covenant. Different and distinct species cultures languages political factions. The members of the Covenant have fleshed out histories varieties inspecies weapons fashion accents. Individuals have their own motivations and as interesting as they may be they are a pittance compared to the interplay of the woven tapestry of motivations the world offers. Every part of them is thought out down to how they got here. This leads to considerations like troop movements instead of just teleporting shit wherever the plot deems convenient.There needs to be something diverse enough to be immersive not just a single thing added to our world but a whole unique world we can enter into. If your game or narrative is crippled by removing a single thing its not immersing. Make a Halo game without the Chief.,halo,dcekhgi,187,t5_2qixk

Its evolved and changed no doubt.Also yes if you call people who disagree with you fanboys and insult them they arent gonna want to listen to you.gtThe gameplay mechanics that made Halo fun are no longer present in Halo  amp . The soul of Halo left with Bungie and is now being trampled by i. When Halo  came out the excitement and love was felt by both Bungie and the community and now im not even sure i cares anymore.Like what? I dont think have removed many mechanics aside from dual wielding but they did alter them.I care lots of people here care and yes  cares.gt At this point the best thing both i and Microsoft could do would be to release every Halo game on PC and let the true fans restore the legacy the Bungie made games once held. Im sorry this was so ranty it just makes me upset to think people actively support a bullshit cash grab system the singlehandedly is destroying a big part of my childhood.So sorry but I like the game. Halo was a big part of our lots of our childhoods. I dont see Halo getting destroyed at all.You dont have to like  and I dont blame you for not.

10330962,0,t3_5ntmcw,I dont think theres any way to fix this issue.The original writers with the inspiration are gone now we have generic copypaste formulaic writers and it shows in the awful uninspired dialog.The main problem is the lack of talent you can bend the current i writers to write anything you want it doesnt mean theyll put out anything good. Just look at how they arranged the teams each has  guys and  women on it all characters are easily interchangeable theres an easily forgettable black guy as the lead as opposed to sgt.Johnson whom everyone loved it just screams lack of talent and that they are simply checking off a list of requirements. Gender diversity check cultural diversity check good enough writing check and so on. Not saying that stuff is bad just saying that it follows such a formulaic approach to creating a story instead of coming up with really interesting characters that complement each other. The whole atmosphere feels flat in Halo . Even the writing for is Guilty Spark clone was lame.We can see this as an issue in all of gaming Gears of War  suffered from the same issues just a lack of inspiration and talent compare the  COGS from the first  games to the  soldiers in gow. Look at other games like Destiny and the Division they have no soul if that makes sense. In fact the only games that give me any real feeling or emotion anymore are Rockstar games.tldrThe issues presented in Halo  are not unique to i but are actually present in many major studios.

Aye on point with the Cortana change one of the weirdest twists they have done and it did not resonate well. Brave idea just did not work for my taste. Pretty much ruined one of the few things I liked about Halo . Cortana should have been gone forever if you ask me. Why go through the trouble of doing the biggest emotional event in the entire series if they just toss it away in the next game?I like your fix to the noblebright Spartan IVs killing off almost all of them making history repeat itself would be a really cool way to bring back some of the adult themes the classical Halo had.

10362851,0,t1_dchyby1,While I totally agree that most H maps would be too small for H there are some Halo  maps that are plenty big. The big takeaway here though is that Halo s maps were much better designed than Hs. In H theres just to much stuff in the way too much cover.The biggest problem Halo  has faced is that with arena MP all playlists aside from BTB have been fairly small cramped maps. You are exactly right when you say Hs mechanics dont work for small maps but that seems to be the majority of the size of the maps we have.Halo s mechanics are fine we just need larger more open spaced maps to properly utilize them. Furthermore larger maps would help bring back the fun vehicular combat that we all used to know and love.,halo,dciovc6,1,t5_2qixk
10365231,0,t1_dcixwjl,I thought Reachs campaign was very mediocre especially after coming off of the original trilogy and ODST. The story seemed more rushed compared to the other games. We couldnt sit for a bit and get lost in the lore and the universe. It was big battle death big battle death big battle death and so on. It was very repetitive. All members of Noble Team had more personality and character development than Team Osiris but they didnt have enough to make me feel bad for them after they died unlike Johnson or Cortana. I didnt get attached to them like previous main characters.The only part I really like about the campaign is the finale which is a brilliant send off. But the rest I thought was very boring and didnt surprise me like the previous  games. It isnt as blatantly horrendous as Halo s campaign but its very mediocre compared to its predecessors and the game that came after. But thats just my opinion.,halo,dciylv2,0,t5_2qixk

10441814,0,t1_dcrlcqo,Hey thanks a lot! Figuring out a suitable title was actually kind of difficult.I first wanted to use just ODST or Orbital Drop Shock Troopers but I think those didnt really fit.Feet first into hell was another one but I couldnt get the formatting to work  with white and red letters . I think an online series under the name helljumper was created but they suddenly stopped or something and there was a lot of backlash. So I wanted to avoid that.I figured this name was quite fitting as it just had the right sound to it and it is the name of an in game warship. Just like the forward unto dawn.I agree though maybe feet forward into hell or helljumpet wouldve been better. But I think this was a good middleground.Glad you like it! ,halo,dcrnq95,1,t5_2qixk

10529599,0,t1_dd1mrv6,To be honest if you compare it to other FPSs right at launch it was amazingIt actually worked completely playable no major bugs no content that was at launch in other games forge etcMeanwhile CoD has always had issues with launch as well as large bugs. Plus season pass bullshit. Same with Battlefield and Battlefront.GTAV was another very complete game at launch. Destiny. Hahahahhaha no it was not complete. Only the Vault of Glass saved that game along with its gunplaySo while the title was kinda sensationalized helps sell the game it wasnt entirely true. The post launch content should def be not ignored but the launch makes or breaks a game.

10530823,0,t1_dcnu7sv,Same. Theres far too many different mechanics going on at once for my tastes. Cards card selection ingame being RNG getting more cards being RNG leader powers being cards and in the same RNG pool cards having upgrades energy energy being RNGdropped around the map being able to drop units anywhere but dropping units outside base gives them half health instantcap objectives and games being so short theres really no strategy on top of all this.If it has to have this much needless complexity games should at least be longer. But personally Blitz is basically everything I dont like in the game rolled into one. Im just waiting for PvE in Standard or Deathmatch thats all I really want.,halo,dd1s8dh,3,t5_2qixk

They honestly have just been fucking up. Thats a fact. Am i entitled to it? To a point I am. False advertisement leads me to buy a game with my money. I in all natural and legal rights am entitled to be upset. But is that the case for few missing things? No absolutely not and thats simply not what I am saying. Unless they advertised those specific things. All Im saying is that if a specific armor piece or game type is missing its purely from their own laziness as developers. There is no excuse. Explanation of laziness but no excuse. Invasion is a simple game type. Elites too. Brutes would be asking for more and understandably absent. But these things are okay. Its fine that they are absent.

If youre familiar with most FPS games raw mouse input is just a straight pipe from your mouse and driver into the game with no weird acceleration or tinkering going on. The sensitivity is just the scale on which the engine interprets the DPI and latest movement.H Forge for PC has some of the wonkiest mouse feeling Ive ever messed with.  Halo  for PC had better feeling mouse input because it was raw.

However the infinity from the get go is shown to be something totally and utterly unique to anything else in the UNSCs arsenal and is used advertised and represented as a major focal point of the story only for it to never be discussed at all.       It is a focal point. What is there to be explained? Its a ship.           gtNo but it deserved more than it got. Imo this always would have been an issue when deciding to explore the foreigners more. I think its a mistake personally to choose to do so during present day time in cannon. If they really wanted to demonstrate to us what the foreigners were and what they did they should have made a prequel series as to not make Halo  the series of exposition dumps and you need external content to understand this it was in regards to that. Halo  does it better imoOne of the few things Halo  does do better than another Halo game by going back to merely referencing and demonstrating the effects of the foreigners disappearance and their legacy while only providing the basic information you need to understand whats going on as opposed to a rushed exposition dump.

But once you get down to specific events they end up not making sense because they were made clear in the EU but not in the games.The beginning of the sequels are not consistent with the end of the previous game. You just end up in a new area with a new starting point. Of course Halo  did this too but that isnt the topic here.Halo  ended up being less about Chief and more about the Arbiter less than halfway through the game and people hated that so in Halo  Arbiter basically became the sidekick outside Oh yeah kill Truth. Thats not taking into account all of the other problems with Halo  just to drive the plot forward.The characters are more likable but again in Halo  some of them basically start holding the Idiot Ball and then in Halo Reach they were just flat out uninteresting.,halo,de4o0fp,5,t5_2qixk

All the other flaws in the game aside Ive not seen anyone else say how great they look. Especially the first one with the Spartans truly great to see a Spartan team working together like that. There was a few too many scenes of Isabelle and Anders messing about with terminalsdata which looked like somebody had given an intern something to animate and not nearly enough of the Spirit or Fire. But it is so good to see cut scenes of this quality in Halo and Id like to see similar things in Halo .,halo,de8rzx0,2,t5_2qixk

10956015,0,t3_5wfe9z,Sprint is finely tuned and balanced with how it is currently.I think the ranking system is great and is about as good as we are going to get for now. Any improvements are welcome but its hard to get a MM system where you ALWAYS match with players of equal skill. It simply isnt always going to happen and if you were matching accurately based on skill MM times would take forever.The campaign certainly needs to be better but Im not sure if that will happen after the last two games.Better maps need to be in this game. I want to remember the maps like I remembered Guardian or Hang Em High.I think the art style in general should be closer to Halo s art style. Elites spartans weapons etc. looked the best during that era to me. Spartan charge and ground pound are very noobfriendly and need to be taken out at least for competitive play.

11384904,0,t1_dfmezqh,Youre equating minor design changes with the core halo formula which is a mistake. Dual wielding and equipment arent what made the original halo games what they were. It was the trinity of gunmeleegrenades on a canvas with no sprint or abilities smaller maps at least for v and social features like a working ranking system social and ranked playlists an extremely detailed and engaging website and with frequent special events with the developer. Those elements remained constant for the  games although Halo  didnt really have a matchmaking mode per say since you had to use an outside program to find gamesH doesnt satisfy all of these metrics. Yes it has even starts and power weapons on the map again and H has some semblance of social and ranked playlists but the core gameplay strayed away from that trinity. And in straying away from the trinity it stopped being a halo game because the fundamental formula that governs player interaction is vastly different between H and H. ,halo,dfmgjz6,1,t5_2qixk

11442675,0,t3_6397z1,After a few thousand hours and five years in Planetside  I still joke that Planetside is one of my favorite Halo games. Bunch of scifi soldiers with overshields fighting eachother...A proEarth military faction UNSC a freedom fighting proindependence colonial faction  Insurrection and a religious zealot faction with purple armor and floaty tanks influenced by ancient aliens  Covenant. Yep lines up pretty well.To be honest Halo itself is right on the edge of being able to do it. Warzone has several Planetside like systems   namely pulling equipment from terminals and a focus on larger maps with multiple primary and secondary objectives just on a smaller scale. They just continue to target small maps and small matchmade teams. If they went full MAG and were able to do a  v  type thing you could have some serious competition there.Even Planetside  had the Server Smash tournament based on  vs  hour matches. Seriously they could do it if they tried and it would be beyond epic. Full blown Mombasa metropolis fights fighting to the last man of a company on Reach UNSC fighting to take back Harvest? Like HaloReachs invasion gamemode but way fuckin bigger multiple lanes of attack multiple teams fighting eachother. Its what Ive been wanting in video games in general for years decades even but only a few even come close and even then not quite fully realized. Honestly only Planetside MAG and Battlefield and in some ways ARMA ever got close.,halo,dft0m2q,3,t5_2qixk

Carbine BR DMR pistol add a good enough variety in weapon look and feel but still take skill to use. Removing the excess number of autos beyond just the starting AR is a better step. Maps have at least  overpowered auto pickups on the map at any one time. In my opinion there should be no more than  of SMG Storm Rifle and Brute Plasma Rifle on the map at any one time similar to how shotgun spawns.

Youd have to be a madman to expect a sequel to release with the exact same story. Nobody is asking for that.  gtMovement speed. Slower pace.Halo s movement speed is almost the exact same as Halo . Here is a comparison. The perceived difference in speed is due to the decrease in FOV.  gtMLG support.  Im not exactly sure what this is referring to so Im not going to refute you on that.  gtWeapon selection  Brute Weapons.An addition not a change. They didnt take away the SMG and replace it with the Spiker. They just added the spiker.gtSword has less range.Sure. They also gave the sword an energy counter and made it slower to equip. Definitely a change. A welcome one in my opinion because the sword was extremely powerful in Halo .gtArt style.I would personally put it down to fidelity since Halo  is visually more impressive than Halo . They didnt do anything to the architectural style of pieces but they did change the texture the colour dramatically improved the lighting etc. If you really are saying that Halo  changed Halo s art style I think youre in the minority.gtAutos.I have no idea what that means.gtLeveling system. Ranking system.Definitely a change. Probably a controversial one at the time. gtGarbage remakes.   Im not sure why this is in here. Guardian and Valhalla are two of the most popular maps of all time. Last Resort might be a bit more niche but is there anybody saying Zanzibar was perfect and Last Resort is cancer? Theyre practically the exact same. Blackout has never been a popular remake though.gtProjectile shooting.Yeah definitely a change and probably the weakest part of Halo .gtDifferent game modes.  What game modes are you talking about?gtCampaign is weak. Story is poorly written.Thats an opinion and not a popular one. Halo s story sucks is also an opinion but a widely held one.gtAliens as an ally.Pretty much goes with the change in campaign writing.gtSkill removing and gameplay stopping equipment.Another addition not a change to an existing feature. Equipment was poorly integrated I agree. But you could delete it off of the maps and nothing else would need to be changed to make the map work.gtNo button combos.Those were glitches of course theyre going to get fixed.If you actually believe that Halo  was as big of a change from Halo  as Halo  is from Halo  youre delusional.,halo,dfw9un0,1,t5_2qixk

11513294,0,t1_dg1047t,By reducing the spread you mean effectively reducing the size of the reticle? That WOULD require more accurate aim but it would also bring the AR into precision weapon territory a redundancy we dont need. The AR currently awards perfect accuracy for your first few shots when properly burst firing which does encourage burst firing. But The problem is that there is so much magnetism and aim assist it really doesnt matter if your shots are accurate or not they always find their target.  So this cancels out the need to burst fire.The current spread when holding the trigger isnt wide enough to carry shots outside the path to the enemies body. They could remedy this be having a massive spread with only burst shots finding the center.  Or they could have massive recoil but tighten the spread. I also think we shouldnt have ANY random spread. I think it should follow as identical pattern every time. Without the aim assist and magnetism  a skilled player could use stick movement to counteract the effect. This way AR battles could actually be interesting.,halo,dg117x1,2,t5_2qixk

11546083,0,t3_64p0xk,I dont feel like theres any perfect Halo campaign. They are all a mixed bag of some good levels and some crap which is unfortunate because the game makes you beat the bad levels to get to all of the good levels.Several of Halo CEs levels are the best in the franchise. The AI is also the best even though you need mods to get the most out of it. There is a lot of copypasta in the bad levels but I still dont hate CEs bad levels as much as Halo .Halo  is the spottiest campaign. Theres a few decent levels but the rest are just painfully bad. The AI is a downgrade from vanilla CE AI and you spend a lot of time waiting for waves of enemies to enter the same areas you already fought. The plot is bad and ends on a cliffhanger to boot.Halo s levels are highly polished but it suffers from the worst AI in the series and the gameplay gets interrupted by cheesy cutscenes way too often fuck off Cortana. Shooting brutes in the face while they just stand there is so boring that only a few levels feel even midly worth replaying.I like the concept of a more Metroidesque level structure in ODST but the gameplay felt too similar to Halo  and I couldnt really stand more of the same.IMO Reach strikes the best balance of level polish and gameplay. The AI is finally on par with vanilla CE again there are plenty of CElike outdoor environments and the weapons are way less shitty. None of the levels are quite as good as the best CE levels but none of the bad levels are as bad...overall its a very consistent campaign.,halo,dg4r1dc,-1,t5_2qixk
