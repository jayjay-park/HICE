1205819,0,t3_27wvro,My feeling is that shell be ok given that she  found a route thats divided up into manageable sections  staying in hotels. If shes good with fixing flats and basic bike maintenance clearly shes covered in the health department  shell be set. I would just advise that since this is her first touring trip to make sure shes aware of eatingdrinking enough and to be mindful of things she hasnt experienced yet like saddle discomfort biking in heatcold and possible pain issues from bike fit that only arise after long distances. As long as she has some sort of bailout plan in case a physical issue comes up she should be all good. Also when Im out on my long distance endurance rides my husband monitors me via iPhones Find My Friend feature. Im usually riding with at least one other partner but it gives him peace of mind he can check in on my location at anytime. ,ladycyclists,ci59u1e,2,t5_2ycxz

3364806,0,t1_cp4dkvg,Hey thereThe jeans came in a couple days ago. All real pockets. The front pockets are in deep the back ones in. Honestly I wish they couldve gone a little deeper... but these are girl jeans so I guess the manufacturers thinking baby steps?,ladycyclists,cpbta8h,1,t5_2ycxz
3965094,0,t3_35qnl0,Pinkbike has articles? I never noticed or cared. Theyre kind of the CoolRanch Flavored Baja Blast Limited Edition Mountain Dew of bike websites. I mean I think Im registered. Im pretty sure Ive gone there. I know I tried to sell something there... But when it comes down to feeding my bicycle internet reading cravings Pinkbike is that last and only option at  am when everything else is closed.Frankly Id be more interested in following her personal facebook page than sifting through Pinkbike for an article with any kind of substance.,ladycyclists,cr8964m,3,t5_2ycxz

4007318,0,t3_36c2rk,I started out with a hybrid  its much nicer to pedal about in traffic quite upright. Bonus  you can see where youre going. As with most things dont buy the cheapest bike possible because if its crap youll end up hating it. Just read some reviews try a few out and talk to the LBS. Try some female specific bikes  theyre proportioned for longer legs compared to torso. Once youve found the notcheapest femalespecific bikes in your size you might not have that many to choose from so that makes things a bit easier!I used to just wear my normal clothes for zipping around the city or normal gym stuff if I was going further or faster. Get the bike first then worry about the shorts. I didnt bother with padded shorts until I was doing  miles  on my road bike. Dont be tempted by a padded saddle whatever you do unless you like a chaffed chuff someone might say the same about padded shorts but see how you go anyway.I used to get the train  miles up the coast from the city I lived in and bike home it was lovely. Enjoy!,ladycyclists,crd2c8l,5,t5_2ycxz
4422142,0,t1_csnbn23,I do sometimes get the sensation that because Im holding on so tightly if I twitch at all the bars move. Ill be traveling abroad in a few days for the summer so hopefully Ill have more access to green space or sleepy streets. I have a good friend there who cycles a lot so hopefully she can help me figure out bike fit. Thanks!,ladycyclists,cso3zm3,2,t5_2ycxz
4422148,0,t1_csn09vk,Its so hard here I live in a really congested area. But Im going abroad for the summer and it should be quieter so hopefully I can practice more there.,ladycyclists,cso40ht,1,t5_2ycxz
4458755,0,t3_3c5wnv,In my case the answer is hills. If Im running I have to work hard to feel any wind resistance.A little wind on bare skin thats wet with sweat is cooling and pleasant when youre running fast enough.Continuous wind on bare skin thats wet with sweat is chilly and unpleasant when youve got to coast down big hills.,ladycyclists,csspgrm,8,t5_2ycxz

7710082,0,t1_d3hqm2j,Totally agree about a good chamois cream! I use DZ Bliss which is a thinner consistency than the Assos cream but it has excellent slip. It also has a tingly feel which I know is not for everyone but Im a fan. ,ladycyclists,d3il29m,3,t5_2ycxz
7832612,0,t1_d3w79rq,It could be chamois or it could be that youre putting too much weight forward instead of back on your sit bones. Or both. That sounds awful either way. Regardless of what you go with it sounds like you need to try something different. Talk to the guysgirls at the bike shop and see what they recommend. Maybe theyd let you try a couple out. ,ladycyclists,d3wgbmu,3,t5_2ycxz
