276103,0,t3_1x6in2,Nice photos! It looks like in a lot of them you were using a bunch of ambient light from headlamps. Were you using tripod for those and did the models have to stay super still?,caving,cf9dpn5,1,t5_2roda
463806,0,t1_cfszdwc,That sucks. All that work undone by equipment failure. I for one appreciate the effort and the intention! Nothing more beautiful and fitting than going au naturel in nature!,caving,cfszih5,1,t5_2roda

978717,0,t3_25b029,So that google link was useless unless you want major tourist locations.Im fairly new to the area so I have no idea where they are but if you find any Im down for a run through.There is a grotto in PHX that goes through private caves occasionally but Ive never been able to make a meeting. ,caving,chfjecb,2,t5_2roda
1295189,0,t1_cifbehy,Awesome! Im very happy to hear this. Sinks is a great cave and the cows are super friendly. ,caving,cifbqan,1,t5_2roda
1908046,0,t1_ckj3gbp,Cool. I was thinking of trying to take my girlfriend to Organ cave because she has never been caving and I thought that would be a good introduction. Plus it not being open on Sundays makes it a little difficult for us.  The website can be confusing when trying to figure out the different tours available. I would be interested in trying it sometime. Do you provide helmets and lights? I have my own but my girlfriend doesnt. Do you do caving outside of guiding tours in Organ cave?,caving,ckj3vlb,1,t5_2roda

3283841,0,t1_cp2ivqc,All of this yes. Though the recessed button idea would still have to be easy enough to click with some grubby wet muddy gloves. I find myself switching between the flood and proximity settings quite often and these east coast caves can cause for some mud mess on the lamp. I also hate the color of LED lamps far too bright for the sport and its really annoying when I bring a fellow caver sporting his fancy new gazillion plus lumens LED fuggin purply headlamp and all he does is blind everyone. Honestly I have great luck with my Black Diamond storm? headlamp except for the strap its slippy. I hate the back pack for batteries too some cavers swear by it but its bulky. A helmet is large enough to fit through tight passage why bother with a silly compartment on the back of your head that you will inevitably forget about and crack on a rock behind you.Odd train of thought but I think there are some fantastic lamps out there Id like to see some better helmets and shoes though.,caving,cp2l204,1,t5_2roda
3292370,0,t1_cp302e4,Well I personally prefer to have one on each shoulder and one in the middle of my chest and lastly one attached to the end of one of those selfie sticks. No one can know how extreme I am unless I capture it form every angle. ,caving,cp3k23v,4,t5_2roda
3881963,0,t3_34wc93,I forget their specific names but there are some nice caves up around the Howe CavernsSchoharie county area. ,caving,cqyrzjn,1,t5_2roda
3926749,0,t1_cr3ucp5,True enough. But if it has been standing for a hundred years it might make it a few more hours. It takes a special breed.,caving,cr3vvfi,4,t5_2roda
4193301,0,t3_38uynx,Thats going to be a fun trip! Cave Loop can keep you busy for a whole weekend. Just bring some sturdy boots lava is really though on them helmet with a helmet mounted lamp and leather gloves and kneepads for the crawls. Pay close attention to where you are its really easy to end up walking in circles in the larger ones. And carry three sources of light. Each of you! And have fun!Edit Of course carry also a pack with water food extra layer for warmth a small first aid kit etc. ,caving,cry8gox,3,t5_2roda

4494341,0,t3_3cmpoi,Canyoning.  I suspect more cavers have been canyoning than vice versa.,caving,csx6520,7,t5_2roda
6296316,0,t1_cz57dri,Presumably the ongoing survey project extended the cave to this point where they found the water table.,caving,cz5bisq,3,t5_2roda
6520215,0,t1_cztlr5a,I can understand that for sure. It really helped us find Cathedral and avoid some serious danger in places though. I guess youre referring more to the tagging etc right?,caving,cztqp3p,1,t5_2roda
6619577,0,t1_d03qgmt,Fair enough  If were ever both in England lets do this cave together and settle it for good.,caving,d040rxy,1,t5_2roda

8740060,0,t1_d6fvcm9,For some through trips you can ascend out on different ropes but you usually have to descend and reascend them when you rig them in advance anyway!,caving,d6y5pgz,2,t5_2roda
8955687,0,t1_d7ob18p,I know a guy in the DCC whos got a fancy custom rig.... I should try it when we go caving in the UK in October. Preferably above ground cause the y looks complicits as fuck! I like my simple.... Cause its simple! ,caving,d7oc8co,1,t5_2roda
9660884,0,t3_5ddgaa,I use a long rack with steel bars except for the top bar. If I had to get a new one itd be a minirack with a hyperbar either stainless or titanium bars. I also have an aluminum  with ears for shorter drops. Im oldschool and stay away from gadget descenders Petzl in particular. Thats just me.,caving,da3wmrv,7,t5_2roda
9876636,0,t1_dat98mc,We managed to get out by a different route  it was a D maze cave. There were other people down there with us in other areas. They helped us find another way out.We probably couldve gone out the way we came in but it wouldve been a pain in the ass because of how loose the dirt on that slope was and how steep and high it was.,caving,dauy5r0,1,t5_2roda
