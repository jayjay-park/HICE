1884974,0,t3_2ftsag,So its gameday tomorrow and I never really saw a plan come together on here. I saw people talk about throwing or waving different things but never any consensus on what we were going to do other than make fun of Snuggles. So do I need to bring anything? A rally towel tortillas balloons vuvuzelas anything in particular? and are we going to coordinate a specific time to let everything loose? or are we just doing a free for all? ,SacRepublicFC,ckgbyet,3,t5_2xwzp

4708401,0,t3_3fdhn6,it will be interesting to see how buckle adjusts from his first games as head coach with friendlies to actual league play.  seeing how we still have a good amount of games left in the regular season while starting off with a win in the final stretch would be nice but preki left us in a solid position for some growing pains with paul.,SacRepublicFC,cto15vm,4,t5_2xwzp
4816864,0,t1_cu1myvj,Its not just that these prices put Republic FC at the middle of the pack compared to MLS they compete with European prices as well. For example Ill be moving to Spain in a few weeks where my local team Celta Vigo charges  for an adult membership depending on where you sit. Membership at Celta gives you access to all home games of both the first team and the reserves although theres an extra fee to get the Bara and Real tickets if you sign up after a certain date. This is a club that finished th in La Liga last year and will likely be fighting for a spot in continental competition this year. So for about  per game Ill get to go see Valencia Sevilla Atletico Madrid Villareal Athletic Bilbao etc.. In other words for slightly less money in Spain you get to see world class soccer whereas at Republic FC you get to see MLS reserve teams play for about what youd pay for first division soccer most other places on earth. A renewing member under  Years of age would have paid  for a Celta membership to sit in the supporters area this year. An early renewal would guarantee them admission to all games including Barcelona and Real Madrid. This works out to about  per game to sit in the supporters section of a team currently in the mid table of the strongest league in the world. A team that is also in the midst of a stadium construction project one that is actually happening its not contingent on gaining access to a higher competition. The prices at Republic FC are too damn high for the product they deliver. ,SacRepublicFC,cu1pe65,10,t5_2xwzp

6004912,0,t1_cy66nw3,Jesus dude. Its certainly arguable whether its worth Buckle taking the risk on gilberto but that reaction is pretty over the top.
