My husband and I woke up when I was  weeks plus  days with the intention of getting labor started for real.  We had sex went for a walk had sex went for another walk had sex againand went for a few more walks throughout the day.  Id be lying if I said any one of those intimate moments was enjoyable for me.  But it worked by pm I was in active labor and exhausted.Stick with breastfeeding it gets much easier after the first couple of weeks. Its especially easier if your baby is never introduced to plastic nipples. After all youve been through I know its hard but remember  you can do this. Youre body was made for this ,BirthStories,ciopcug,1,t5_2yqez
