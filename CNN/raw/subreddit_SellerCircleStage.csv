5133071,0,t3_3l9no8,Im a little late but I figured Id chime in anyways     I have the smallest size box available at my USPS office. It costs me  every  months. It something bigger than the box gets shipped to me they just put a slip in so I can pick it up later. I live in a sketch neighbourhood so I have everything I order off Amazon shipped there. I know a lot of girls dont do this but I use my P.O. Box as a return address. I just dont like have the return address the same as the sending address to me it looks sketchy but thats just my opinion. A lot of girls feel differently than I do about it so definitely read about it and decide for yourself.    I take cash as payment but I dont advertise it. Its something I offer to trusted buyers. If you do take cash make them put a tracking number on the envelope. Dont start a service before you have the cash in hand.  Basically I love my P.O. Box haha. I hope this helps ,SellerCircleStage,cv4q61r,2,t5_33dgk
5434240,0,t1_cw5hfta,The fake emails and names are pretty obvious especially since my name is so unusual I am the only person that comes up when you google it. But I am curious about the face aspect Ive heard of some women doing hand delivery for panties and having some videos with face. Is there a reason to stay away from it all together aside from the possible recognition? Have there been instances of blackmail and what not?,SellerCircleStage,cw6a1gz,2,t5_33dgk

7507317,0,t3_4i6m3n,That really sucks. One thing you could do is find out what giftcards are most commonly soldswapped online and get buyers to purchase those giftcards for you which you then exchange for cash.Ive done this before with purse.io  I just charge a gift card fee to help cover lost moneytime spent making the exchange.Edit Apparently it is only temporary,SellerCircleStage,d2vjkyd,3,t5_33dgk

9283401,0,t3_57ka3p,uShamelesslyUnshaven is pretty popular. I dont think you need to shave to make sales.I have hair on top and a lot of other girls do as well. Do what you like and youll attract the type of buyers who like it. Theres definitely a market for hairy girls. I occasionally post on rGoneWildHairy. The guys there are so sweet and welcoming.,SellerCircleStage,d8sqlh6,4,t5_33dgk

10058799,0,t3_5jskgs,I dont think it would be worth doing. Theyd likely want to see something public to decide if they want to pay for private content which means running a second Twitter account in which case you might as well just do a snapchat subscription. The only way this might make sense to do is if you used something like Hootsuite to schedule posts but youd likely spend more timeeffort setting that up than it would be worth.,SellerCircleStage,dbiop7e,2,t5_33dgk

10151367,0,t3_5lcp82,Trial and error. Experiment with photo angles prices pantyad types etc.Also keep in mind that the industry is heavily oversaturated so theres lots of competition. Most pantysellers also offer more than just mailable goods  kik skype vid and more.Expanding where you advertise helps. Selling in one sub wont give to the same exposure and thus business as selling on multiple selling subs posting teaser photos on nonselling subs posting on social media etc.Personally most of my panty sales come from regulars who buy my other services too.,SellerCircleStage,dbupom2,4,t5_33dgk

11245416,0,t3_605h5i,I am . International priority shipping in my country costs somewhere between  eur depending on the weight of the package. With tracking  eur. Delivery time with priority mail to US is usually  days in rare cases weather..  months. To UK  days. of my mail came to the US safely in  cases the package got lost when it was already travelling across US. Never any trouble with customs.Also take into consideration that post office always marks your package with postal code and country before shipping so the customers will know where youre from. Its better to ship from another post office and not the one in your town so they wont know your exact location.,SellerCircleStage,df6ng8l,2,t5_33dgk
