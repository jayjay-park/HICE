1643145,0,t3_2d1tdy,Gurren Lagann is one of those shows that lends itself well to a western audience. Its bright and colorful with plenty of action and an easytofollow story most of the character names are simple and hard to forget and doesnt try to make itself sound extremely deep. It just wants to be big loud and fun and I think anybody can appreciate something like that.So yeah the dub is definitely one of the better ones out there and seeing as you mentioned FMA DBZ and AoT youll probably enjoy this one too especially since its a lot of the same voice actors involved.,gurrenlagann,cjma6ss,1,t5_2so72

3144388,0,t3_2w354e,Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is fantastic. Its shaped like a western cartoon like Johnny Bravo or Dexters Lab  minutes per section  sections per episode except for a few. lots of sex and dick jokes. imagine a much more mature powerpuff girls. Here is a taste of what kind jokes to expect when you watch it.  episodes. I hope you love utter ridiculousness and sexy i mean cool fight scenes. Also dont know if its your thing or not but the English voices are actually better than the Japanese ones. Fuck what I said later on in the post this is the one show to watch. FLCL is trippy as fuck.  episodes and you wont understand what the hell is going on and you will love every second of it. Dead Leaves is an OVA that lasts  minutes and is a mix of FLCL Panty and Stocking and TTGL. its high action filled nonsense.Inferno Cop is  episodes it started as a web show i think.  to  minute episodes you can finish it in an hour and its all on youtube watch this if nothing else.Evangelion is a classic Gurren is a parody of it actually. Eva is super serious and slower paced but when shit happens SHIT HAPPENS. ominous as fuck with the feeling of god is watching. I love it but its a way different show than Gurren.  episodes and an ending movie to replacerun alongside the last Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is also fantastic. make sure its britherhood not the basic fullmetal alchemist.  brothers have the best bond in all of anime more than Simon and Kamina to be honest in a world where alchemy is real and its militarized to the extreme. really good fight scenes. cant really show one if you dont understand the consent of this universes alchemy. Highly Recommended.  episodesAfro Samurai isnt a show but rather an OVA with good fight scenes. think samurai champloo with Samuel Jackson as the main  characters. if that means nothing to you feudal Japan with hip hop with the main character being a badass voiced by Samuel L Jackson.,gurrenlagann,conwvjh,1,t5_2so72

8034480,0,t3_4p8kjm,In response to the part with Simon falling into depression it made sense to me because when Kamina died he was Simons rock. All of his actions and beliefs were defined by Kamina. Kamina was almost a God to him so when he died his entire world came crashing down. On the other hand when Nia and the others died he had redefined himself already. While the others were his friends and important to him they werent his entire world. Even moreso when Kamina died he saw it as in vain. He thought if only they had run away he may not have died. He died for a cause that Simon saw as stupid and superfluous. When Nia and the others did it was for a cause he was okay with. He knew running away wasnt an option. They had to keep moving forward. tldr Kamina is God and reckless,gurrenlagann,d4j5ggd,13,t5_2so72
