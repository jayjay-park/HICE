262505,0,t1_cf6mtsa,Worked in Vaughan around Christmas time. Id say both are shitty driving conditions. However I felt in Brampton its more of a Expect everyone to be a dumbshit not paying attention. Where as in Vaughan its more along the lines of Which cocky Beamer driver is going to use the middle turning lane to clear hundreds of cars of traffic? Not that it doesnt happen in Brampton.Personally I have ZERO probelms with a redlight program as evidently no amount of enforcement could cure the amount of uneducated drivers and dare I say it careless drivers. I see people blatantly break rules at traffic lights no stop to make a right turn Mooching the shit out of the advanced green texting at an advance green preventing many cars from clearing the light causing backups pulling off uturns against oncoming traffic and finally running reds without a care in the world and if there is one reason I can see for such poor driving and thats just at the lights! it is the lack of immediate consequences. People think they can get away with anything and if it takes cameras to monitor us  so be it! People have proven that they just arent responsible enough to drive without a baby sitter. I once seen driver reversing along the shoulder of the  because they missed their exit and decided it was a good idea to reverse at least  meters to hit their off ramp instead of just going to the next ramp and comes back down.Personally I think cameras should be used to monitor the roads in general. Im not a fan of the Orwellian state but we need someone to monitor this and more importantly keep video for records for use when it comes to insurance claims. Im not saying put cameras on residential streets but Im pretty sure we could agree many of the main roads could use a system where blatant careless and mindless driving is not tolerated.

11120722,0,t3_5ypph8,My worst taxi experience was at a Bachelorette party. We got a cab from the club to the hotel we were staying at. The hotel was easy to get to get on the highway get off at the next ramp and the hotel is right in front of you. Most of us were drunk though I was sober as was another girl who doesnt drink because of her religion I was broke at the time and couldnt afford drinks at the club so pre drinks were all I had and I had danced off my buzz. We gave the guy exact instructions to the hotel when I guess he decided that hey these girls are all drunk I can take advantage of that. He completely misses our off ramp proceeds to tell us that he is lost gets off the high way turns around gets back on the high way misses our exit again and rinse and repeat TWO more times seriously padding the metre. It was very obvious that he was trying to rip us off. We finally get to the hotel and the bride who is in no way a push over is seriously pissed and starts yelling at the guy who not only padding the metre but is blaming us for bad directions the entire time even though you can literally see the hotel from where we were on the road. She tells him that she wont pay for the whole trip because it was obviously a rip off. He threatens to call the police. I am afraid of confrontation and not wanting the night to be ruined give the guy the right amount of money forking over my breakfast funds as well as some money from the other sober girl so that the ordeal can be over. He then drove off swearing at us. The bride was a little upset with me for giving in but I didnt want her night ruined and after that it was back to having fun. But man that guy. He was so rude the entire time. We werent being belligerent no one was puking we werent flashing anybody we just wanted to get back to our hotel.,Brampton,desiwoy,4,t5_2rp5y

The Bible has been edited and updated and how much of the original history was rewritten to fit the Churchs purposes? Maybe Jesus wasnt all he was cracked up to be.
