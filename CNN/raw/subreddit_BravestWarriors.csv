What Im guessing is that Chris will save them all by ripping open the space time calliope just as the Aeon Worm is summoned.

1622854,0,t1_cjjpqpd,BW doesnt really on todays pop culture. Its well written and well animated. Thats why people are still watching shows like Cowboy Bebop  years after the fact  and that show was dropped from one channel picked up by another channel and been converted from LDVHS to DVD to Bluray and unofficially digital.If anything Braves Warriors will live on as a quality example of a series that started and stayed on the internet in an era when TV is still considered a more legitimate place for professional level series.,BravestWarriors,cjjq5uy,5,t5_2tl4p

6903887,0,t1_d0rc0wh,This was my initial thought as well. There was an episode of Dr. Who that seemed to use this premise. I think it was called the doctors daughter had David Tennant as the Doctor. I remember thinking at the time that this  chromosome randomization seemed to be the equivalent of inbreeding. Any thoughts on that?I suppose it could also be argued that he somehow gave her the same  set of copies of his autosomal chromosomes and two copies his x chromosome. I was thinking in theory if this could be accomplished in some way I am not aware of that it shouldnt have any real repercussions since one of human females x chromosomes is silenced any way. Definitely doesnt seem like her father could have done this on accident. But that may make sense storywise still if he was plotting aeon worm things prior to her birth. Seems like a lot of trouble to go through though. I suppose they could have more advanced gen. eng. but I think as things are currently this would be like cloning from somatic cells and would result in shorter telomeres and thus shortened life span like Dolly the sheep. Also I always assumed that the scene from Dimension garden meant he wasnt a servant of the aeon worm until later.Edit Fixed broken link,BravestWarriors,d0yvi54,1,t5_2tl4p

8049644,0,t3_4oqj8u,If its anything like Crunchyroll you can either pay or watch the content with ads. It isnt that expensive either.And its not like there was complete radio silence. They gave us an inkling of what was happening here and there. My friend said they spoke at a panel at NYCC  and although a little vague they told them a lil somethin somethin.Lastly you honestly think YouTube money can pay for production of that quality? Okay... YouTube isnt as profitable for a company as you think it is. For an individual yeah...probably. But a production companystudio? There are way more factors like paying employees and voice actors. It isnt cheap. Its still the entertainment industry. Sure they released the first  seasons for free on YouTube but what did they get in return? Definitely not as much as they gave.,BravestWarriors,d4kut27,1,t5_2tl4p

So we dont know if well have to pay for BWS or not.And i suppose the answer to your second question is no.,BravestWarriors,d5l2ef4,2,t5_2tl4p

10563348,0,t1_dd5fiew,Also to add I remember it was mentioned that it takes  million YouTube views PER VIDEO just to break even. Not one episode of Bravest Warriors has done it or has come close yet. Its not good business to bleed money just to putting out episodes all the time. I ponied up  bucks a month for VRV because I want to support the companyindustry and I cant stand sitting through ads. To each their own but the company did what was best for them.,BravestWarriors,dd5h3v4,2,t5_2tl4p
