61864,0,t1_cel3a2j,Thanks! It really was a helpful read. Ive actually been enjoying the vivid dreams that Ive been having. Its good to know that I only have a couple of weeks to go before I start to settle into this new pattern.Thanks to my states healthcare exchange I can actually afford my own insurance as soon as my benefits start Im planning on starting therapy. Ive been out of therapy for a little over  years and have been planning on going back anyway. Stopping MMJ has made it essential I agree.Im considering Wellbutrin but theres no way in hell Ill start taking antianxiety meds Ive taken them once or twice and I dislike them intensely. I was on Paxil for six years and it was a terrible experience. Worst withdrawal ever!!! Even if it makes things a little harder for me Id prefer to avoid supporting big drug companies. Im fortunate to be living in a beautiful warm area with lots of hiking trails. I havent been able to manage sitting meditation since I quit but walking meditation is starting to be possible again and the exercise and fresh air are doing me a world of good. Im starting a yoga class soon as well.Thanks so much for the info and encouragement! I know I can do this!,leaves,celh1np,1,t5_2s9i3

I bounced around under mgday for years before finally taking nine months to taper offif you dont know about the liquid taper method I strongly suggest you check it out if and when youre ready to quit.Im sorry to hear about the cancer. Most of us go through our days assuming well make it to old age and the vast amount of perceived available time before us makes it easy to put things off until another day. Time is limited for everyone so burn that much brighter knowing that you likely have somewhat less remaining than many of usyou may very well wind up ahead of those of us who still think we have all the time in the world. You could always get hit by a bus tomorrow and that cancer youve doubtlessly spent so much time fearing wont even be what gets you. What a waste that would make of your time worrying about it. Make every day count man.Finally thanks for reminding me of whats good in my life. Selfactualization is my ultimate goal. I hope its yours as well. Cheers friend.,leaves,cemcilw,1,t5_2s9i3

On the other hand it has effected my life every way you have mentioned and is holding me back from any greatness.After seeing your post I decided to join you. Today will be my day  again as well. My biggest motivation? A girl. She is a stoner and we smoke together but she has more success to me and is more of a type A despite her love for the bud. She wont care if I quit she doesnt have to smoke and wont mind if we stop smoking when we are together. But she doesnt live near me and if I actually want to date this girl I have so much work to get my life together and continue making progress in her direction. ,leaves,cev835c,1,t5_2s9i3

174755,0,t1_ceybb3b,I love school and wasnt unmotivated to stop for any reason other than my interests changing and needing more money to pay bills I think I forgot to put in that I have  jobs total food service an art studio and nannying. I started college when I was  and am  classes away from an AA degree which I will be finishing in the next year or year and a half.The main reason that I dropped out of school is because it is my dream to be a personal chef and the most fiscally responsible way to become a chef is to be trained onthejob instead of going to school.I stopped cooking because my roommates dont like having company over but Im moving on Feb. st with  new roomies that love cooking so Im hoping that changes! I used to work out a lot and fell out of the habit and now Im not sure whether its harder to start because its just hard to start working out or because I talk myself out of it when I get stoned. Its hard to find exercise partners because I have such an unpredictable schedule that often goes late into the night too dark to run alone and prevents me from getting up earlier than I need to to get ready for work it only takes  minutes for a morning bowl... but takes an hour for a run and even more for the shower after that. Im not trying to make excuses I promise!Ill often tell myself maybe Ill just skip today and then when I find myself with a spare  minutes I completely forget and accidentallypack myself a bowl and then am  or  hits in before I realize Im not supposed to be smoking and then I just say fuck it and finish smoking till Im high because Im already halfway high and I dont want to waste the whole bowl.,leaves,ceyc6ny,1,t5_2s9i3

232924,0,t3_1ws4mj,Some people respond to stopping fully some people respond to tapering it depends on the person but the rule here is that you have a very defined system that leads to completely quitting in two weeks.The problem with tapering is that it is often more like usually not tapering.  It is somewhere between trying to moderate and bargaining with quitting while telling yourself you are on your way to stopping.The point of tapering is to be quit so there is no reason to taper for more than two weeks.  You also need to keep track of exactly how much you use each time to ensure that your total use is not rising.You need to write down each of these things in advance so you know whether you are following your tapering plan or just putting off quitting.If you find yourself smoking more than your plan or more often than you planned then youve failed and your only option is to quit now for good.For many people that seems like a lot of backflips to avoid some discomfort in quitting.  Youll be in the same place in two weeks anyway.  But if it works for you then thats just fine.  Just make sure its working for you.,leaves,cf4w3sy,9,t5_2s9i3

278216,0,t3_1xa4fl,uhhhm im not sure if this is what you want to hear but I do not think that those symptoms of sweating and bad dreams are a result of lacking marijuana in your system. Rather they are a byproduct of your environmental stressors ie kicked out of school dreading dealing with parents and nerves and anxiety about how the whole situation will play out. And yes if you would smoke to fill up your daily hours and arent doing that then find a new hobby or activity to get your mind off of not smoking and off of the situation  it will probably bring some good clarity.,leaves,cf9lljh,-1,t5_2s9i3

I threw out my smoking accessories and cleaned the drawer I held them in so I wouldnt scrounge for more or be tempted to smoke resin.  Im just wondering though how successful youll be knowing you have weed around.  Youll be looking forward that bowl every second of your day and youll still have those intense cravings.  And your pipebongvape will still be around reminding you of what youre missing.But whatever works for you.  I think its important that you want to quit and that is your priority.  The first few weeks are very difficult but man it is so worth it.  I think most people who have been successful in their quit completely got rid of their stash and smoking accessories.Just my two cents.  Keep us posted on how it goes ,leaves,cf9nyx9,3,t5_2s9i3

And when I start again I end up right where I stopped the last time. Back in old habits.Maybe a threat looming over your head is good for a few weeks. But fear alone is not working in the long run I think.I dont want to hit you with unwarranted advice but you said that others will be hard with you when you cant do it yourself.I really hope it will work for you this time but from my experience it is like this when you dont do anything differently you wont get a different outcome.,leaves,cfe9qe2,1,t5_2s9i3

Pee wee wakes up in his bed and looks around to see if it was real.  Of course it wasnt and Pee Wee has to just go on with actual reality.

624730,0,t3_219ifa,Yeah I know youre saying. Ive been there on every spectrum of it. That was one of the reasons why I sought it out to begin with since it was the only way to achieve peace of mind with all the madness around me.I think you grow older and things quiet naturally like hormones social situations and so on. I dont know if you should expect to be at that level again and that may not be all bad.But I dont discount or diminish the rest of what youre saying at all because Ive been there hardcore. Pharmaceuticals like the SSRI that I took can seriously do a number on you very much akin to a chemical lobotomy and if you look it up very much the same side effects.The bs about balancing brain chemistry is a total farce as we all know but its ironic in that it has the opposite effect. It tries to boost one unnaturally and destroys the natural balance. What happens then is it gives up and just sort of flat lines depleted. As a result you feel all disassociated ... thoughtless... like youre a walking painting just reacting to things out of habit but not feeling them or really living them.Essentially itll boost the seratonine and flatline dopamine. Try looking up dopamine deficiency and seeing if any symptoms seem familiar to any great extent.Symptoms of low dopamine levels can include    depression  the flat apathetic kind    difficulty dragging yourself out of bed    poor focus and concentration    lack of energy    introversion    a tendency to use stimulants such as coffee chocolate NoDoz or alcohol to keep you goingSo what I did was quit everything that fucks with your brain chemistry that way quit smoking etc.Feed your brain some nutrients so that it can heal itself. Work on a healthy diet super foods etc. Omega  is all important and I found it extremely calming better than weed at the time.B complex is also extremely important and should be supplemented. It and omega  are natural anti depressants and brain boosters. You wont be better overnight but it will have a cumulative effect. youll start sleeping better having more energy to go exercise  take walks etc. Do that too. Start jogging if you can get your heart rate up..little at a time whatever you can. Itll help.These are the steps recommended to people for paxil recovery. Brought me a long way over the years.Weed and other things are stresses on your bodymind and that stress acts to deplete your B stores. I learnt that if I smoke weed for a weekend or a week and then run it can take me months to recover at all where Ill feel lethargic depressed anxious and just out of my skin. Supplement with B complex and its like turning on the lightswitch.I would also advice doing the best you can to manage your stress in general.   ,leaves,cgba6po,3,t5_2s9i3

797397,0,t3_239pme,Start reading things you are interested in. Memorize new words and passages from what you are reading. Make it a game. Set very reasonable goals but approach these as a scientist. When I say this I mean quite literally employ the scientific method in your everyday life. It will not only jump start the intellect and imagination it will provide a structured context in which to interact with the inner and outer worlds.One helpful goal is to simply finish everything one starts. The long term lesson from this is to condition oneself to feel inclined to finish things enjoyable or not and to feel the incompleteness of giving up. Humans can be rational but our actions stem from a primitive emotional core. This kind of conditioning is a way to truly influence ones unconscious.The inventor Tesla was an example of this selfconditioning becoming compulsive about finishing anything hed started even if doing so resulted in a physicalmental collapse. Dont hear me wrong Im only giving this extreme example to illustrate my point. One should be reasonable patient and gradual in implementing any sort of change. The value in truly practicing this is learning about ones attention span and true interests. For example starting a lengthy book one can properly gauge genuine interest in the subject by their ease and length of focus. Learning from this one might decide to start with various shorter articles. In paying attention to ones attention span one will start to understand oneself in a new way.Once one strengthens their overall focus by doing things they are compelled to do one will also be more proficient at focusing on things of less interest. Simply because theyve developed positive habits relating to effort and attention.  I started this a few weeks before quitting and found it invaluable in my transition. One isnt who they were before cannabis and wouldnt have been even if they hadnt smoked at all. The key here is change and effort. One isnt trying to return to a state they are inventing a completely new one. Remember weed makes one its devoted slave imagine how much could be accomplished in redirecting that energy into something productive.   ,leaves,cgux13f,5,t5_2s9i3

A friend of mine is a grower in Flagstaff Arizona and offered me free roomboardweed to come over to his place and trim weed all day.  It was always the best medical budhash available.My memory and cognitive abilities are pretty much destroyed and even when sober I forget what Im talking about mid sentence.  Many people actually think I have a learning disorder when I first meet them.  However I have been sober consecutively for about a week straight now and I do feel a thousand times more clear headed then I did when I first quit even though the fog is still pretty thick.Ive found that even if you take a  day break then smoke once it completely resets the brain fog to where it was before you quit so really being sober for many many consecutive days is the only way to fix it.  I had another friend who smoked almost as much as me and it took him about a year straight of being sober to get back to where he was before he started smoking.  Thats both encouraging and discouraging to me as this pretty much means I will never be able to smoke again if I want to keep me life together.I hope this answered your questions if you need any more help dont be afraid to send me a PM.

If youre younger you have to understand that weed affected your mind much differently it screws with your reward system and since your brain is likely still maturing not trying to talk down to you you may just still be going through the process of evening out. Think of how much time you spent stoned. It could take that long before you start to feel any sort of contentment on a daily basis. I feel like that will just make you feel worse but try to change your perspective and respect how far youve come while respecting that you may still have a long way to go. Youre alright and when youre super desperate miserable remember to do anything at all. Go for a walk. Seriously. Its lame but go for a walk. You wont want to youll want to sit and hate. But get up walk around. Look at trees at houses. Whatever. Distract yourself from intrusive thoughts until you no longer have to try so hard to distract yourself and if you feel yourself coming out of that despair even for a little bit take a second to notice it and be a part of that moment. Youre re training your brain to be happy on its own. If youre only taking time to remember the despair the horrible shittastical bullshit of it all you wont be able to pull yourself out of it due to the lack of evidence on the happy side.Baby steps. Any time at all that you feel happy or even just feel good in any way take a second to be like Hey. That was nice.And just go on with your day. Or maybe write it down. Today I saw a squirrel running and it made me laughThen you have an actual record of things that you were DEFINITELY happy about at least for a second so you can prove that jerk in your mind being totally depressed that you can in fact have a good time if you want. Good on you for staying clean man!Dont give in to that negativity you can do this.

920578,0,t3_24nsky,hey I think I kinda get your trouble. Been smoking for  years now thats way too long too. Still not fully able to quit. For almost six weeks now Ive been doing this selfhelpprogram for quitting the smoking. In this period I have learned some stuffWeed is bad stuff when you smoke it a lot for a long time. It makes you lose track of time and it creates patterns in your life. If you have a daily routine it is part of it. Whether you have a job or not are in college or not it is part of your day and your day feels incomplete without it.I myself have been smoking mostly in the evenings and at night. I recently realised that smoking a joint was part of my ritual of going to bed problem was that that also involved some hours on reddit or other nonproductive computer stuff. But even without a computer I find it really hard to go to bed without having smoked in the evening. I realised that it was a ritual and that I would have to change that ritual to stop the whole smoking stuff all together.So it comes down to a little discipline. Im an adult and Id like to think that I have some discipline over myself. The first step is to not smoke for a day. Thats it. And you have done that now so youre on the good path! But tomorrow it is a fresh day and you need that exact same amount of discipline again. Not more not less. Just enough to get you through the day without smoking. If on one day you cant find the discipline then fine smoke away. But the next day you should pick up the discipline again forgive you for some failure because who doesnt fail at trying shit? and try it again!When you regain control or awareness of time youll find that all of a sudden a week will have passed your first week of nonsmoking. You will be fucking proud of yourself. I know I was  Keep it up man. From this point it can only get better but you have to make it better. Lucks wishes!Edit some spelling sorry Im Dutch,leaves,ch8xc14,1,t5_2s9i3

But it stays there most of the time so its ok.I dont know if you need to act humble. But the more you get to know yourself the better you know in which areas you thought of yourself too highly or lowly. I also tend to think of myself as better than others. But then I also think of myself as way worse than others. It gets better because Im working on my ego and Im getting to know myself better and better. Who knows maybe you are a showoff. Maybe its a part of you. Maybe its selfcenteredness which is very typical for most addicts.But seeing your behavior is the first step. Try to stay aware of your patterns and dont beat yourself up for having them and you will be fine for now. And a bit of snark is fun once in a while ,leaves,chkfedx,1,t5_2s9i3

1070086,0,t3_26brms,Personnally I came to the point where I dont give a shit about having an objective discussion about the harmfulness of weed. Is it good is it bad ? Its not my business. Im not voting laws and Im not a doctor I have an opinion based on my experience but I dont think I am a beholder of an absolute truth about this product. A truth that does not exist anyway and that is just an illusion. I will tell you something. You can follow every step program any behavioral therapy that will help to stop the product but the real thing is behind all that. The real thing is trying to understand what were you trying to shut down or to awake in your spirit by smoking weed. What the hell made you lighten your first joint and continue.Anyone has a different reason there are similar patterns but every reason is different.In my experience I am clean for  years or smth like that I took a lot of drugs. Opiates weed cocaine and hallucinogens. For most of them it was a kind of experience I needed to feel what those products really did in order to have my opinion. Weed was different it was easily available and socially acceptable. You know what ? I never shut down the desire to smoke weed. Sometimes it is so strong that I relapse but I dont beat myself for it anymore. I accept it knowing that the next day I will feel bad and dont want to smoke. But now I am aware of it. I am aware that I have this desire and this desire is a desire of pleasure the pleasure of being high. This is not a devilish perverted shit. I opened the pandora box when I was  and I felt pleasure as you had too and this will STAY for some time. Now I have other ways to get pleasure other things I am much more extrovert and I like the simple pleasure of life. For me weed was an extra. And I became obsessed with it because it felt good to be stoned. And you know what when I start to feel this desire which is very strong I laugh about it. My therapy made me accept it and able to laugh about it. This is a long way. By beating weed you are beating yourself. Why do you need to do this could be a nice beginning of thinking. But the first step in order to be able to have this thinking is to stop consumption. ,leaves,chpx8ux,2,t5_2s9i3

I am not entirely sure but I dont think that the amount of is that is in the air is negligible and doesnt show up like if you are smoking yourself. I have plenty of people who I know that are on probation who are smoking. Me and some friends would go smoke at lunch while working and a friend on probation would go with us. We would have the windows down of course and he was still passing drug tests. I would imagine hot boxing a car would be a different story as you are likely to be getting high from being in a hot boxed car. Ive friends who will chill in the living are of his small appartment and we will smoke quite a bit enough to where the room is pretty smokey and friends that cant smoke due to probation are just fine. As far as avoiding you pretty mcuh said it dont be going in hotboxed areas and probably also a closed car where they are even smoking some pot could skew your test results. But as far as I know if youre not getting any sort of feeling of being some what high on pot then youre good. I am around my brother pretty frequently when he vapes in a somewhat open room but thats vapor and he vapes quite a bit. I have been not smoking for  days so I should be clean. I will probably get a test from walgreens here soon to test it out and if I poss positive I would imagine that it is probably from me not being sober quite long enough instead of my brother vaping around me.If I do get a test I will try to remember to let you know what the results are.,leaves,chqa6ol,1,t5_2s9i3

I am going to research if there are meetings in my area although I dont feel like I need that right now. The last several months of smoking didnt feel right. It was nothing more than a stupid habit of making myself feel sick and weak and not doing anything but lying in bed and watching tv as if I had the flu or something. Not a good feeling and I am so happy that I finally had the strength to stop myself from doing that! If anything I could need psychological support in dealing with emotions because they are easily triggered now. So that might be a reason for me to go to a N.A. meeting but psychological help is part of free health care here so I could easily just contact a professional if I feel like it.I feel much better today btw.

Along with the advice mentioned ginger tea whether in teabag form or just straight up sliced ginger in boiling water  will really help with bloating digestion nausea etc. And something I also learned from pregnancy which was similarly horrible I couldnt even keep water down most of the time potato chips. There are healthier baked options out there and you can buy smaller packs so there wont be any bingeing. The salt really helps  and in that vein olives if you like them. If youre a coffee drinker try replacing it with tea for at least a week. It will really help. As for sugar consumption try diluting juice in water so youre not having too much and if youve got a problem with having a lot of sugar try sweetener alternatives particularly xylitol since it protects your teeth.Be careful what music you listen to. Personally anything that gets me down will lead me to use whatever my vice is.

1583484,0,t3_2ce5jq,Smoking that much at an early age can set the tone for the rest of your life. If you are spending half your paycheck on weed maybe you are spending too much on getting high. Things are progressive in my experience. It could all be a phase for your though. One thing for sure is that if you want to be high all the time you are going to be able to do less productive things with your life. You wont be able to get better jobs because most of the best jobs you can get require drug testing. This could be a phase while you are young but it also could be a lifelong habit. If you are willing to exchange material wealth and a productive life in order to get high you are probably heading in the wrong direction. I would try to cut down before your habit becomes so habitual that you end up not being able to stop. Once you turn  you might start mixing alcohol with your pot. Its not bad however if you are already getting high every day it could turn into a worse habit than it is. There are also other drugs out there that you could get into and no matter how you think marijuana isnt a gateway drug it is. Getting used to putting something in your system all the time becomes a way of life and things can get bad very quick. ,leaves,cjerrdy,1,t5_2s9i3

Im finding it strange how easy this quitting thing has been for me after reading some posts from people who are having a tough time. Everyone seems to really want a hit and Im just like Nah Im cool. Dont even yearn for that feeling anymore. Congrats I think weve found the epiphany that expedites the leaving process.Edit oh and thanks for your post.

1673845,0,t3_2djlmg,Hey buddy. I am just on day  and I can tell you it does get better and easier very quickly.  I experienced a quite similar scenario where I knew it would be better for me if I quit altogether. No moderation or occasional experimentation. Part of the reason I was able to do this was because I replaced the more expansive creative thinking which cannabis enables with meditation which appears to open up the same space if not more expansive. I would say commit and you will be successful. Work will become easier and you will feel much better. You can do this for sure. You do not need luck. Just a little bit of determination. I would highly recommend replacing cannabis directly with mediation. Offers all of the same benefits without the pitfalls. Lock and load. ,leaves,cjq5f01,5,t5_2s9i3

Been smoking for almost as long as you and have taken several breaks including one that was one year long.  You can totally do this.  First night sucks  second night you feel proud but it still sucks  and by the fourth or fifth day is when you can start feeling the flavor of life again.

1880561,0,t3_2g25ee,Hey man about two weeks ago I posted on here asking for help after trying to quit for almost a year. I actually got some really good advice that for the first time actually worked. A guy on here told me When you smoke weed you realize youre turning your body into a vessel for your own pleasure at the sacrifice of making the right decisions that will help you achieve your longterm hopes and dreams. Are you truly so weak as to let that happen in the one life that you are lucky enough to have?For whatever reason those words struck a chord and from that day not only have I not smoked but I havent even had the desire to smoke. In fact when I think about smoking I feel disgusted at the weakness that many stoners succumb to.A couple tricks that Ive been using and found to work pretty well are. Work out and work out hard. Get on a daily physical exercise routine and stick to it. I went for . hours and a strict diet right away but I dont think thats right for everyone. I knew that around midnight each night I wouldnt be able to fall asleep because my mind was used to being high so I worked out hard enough to make myself exhausted to fall asleep early and its worked wonders.. Fill your day with activities that will make you feel accomplished at the end of the week and in the long term. Im in  classes my senior year in college and Im having to work my absolute dick off which would have been impossible if I was still blazing daily. I spend hours at the gym and hours at schoolthe library studying and making sure I get my work done early and the best part is I get to save money from my job since Im not spending  bucks a week on pot.. Leave your stoner friends behind this will happen naturally. If you wait to quit you will formulate a whole other arsenal of excuses to use the next time you try. There really is no better time than now. As you said youre in a financial pickle and when do those get better by not being proactive and fixing them? Look at the state of the US economy LOL.You can do it. I did it. Im  years old and all of my friends that arent stoners are making k a year while my stoner friends are slumping along through general college classes working as pizza delivery guys. Im one year away from graduation and theres no way Im going to let weed keep me down. Dont let it keep you down either.,leaves,ckfsty0,2,t5_2s9i3

By  weeks the remnants are trivial lt. I believe.  Honestly its a little unscientific and caseinsensitive but it is a great psychological milestone.   months is enough time to turn a life around.  Dont focus on how long recovery takes it never ends.  One day youll feel great.  Then one day you wont even think about it.  Those are amazing days.,leaves,ckii24k,2,t5_2s9i3

1916545,0,t1_ckjkcrk,Im not a doctor and I know less than  of your story. But it sounds to me like perhaps smoking weed was merely masking other issues that you may need to explore. I know for myself and many other rleaves users weed does a great job of maskingcovering up other problems. It can distract us from the type of self reflection that ironically pot heads claim is inherent within the drug.Ive felt depressed after prolonged breaks from smoking and though I initially wrote it off as being weed related I eventually found through talking to friends and family that the roots of my depression were elsewhere. Maybe smoking weed slowed down the process of finding the root of the problem or maybe it was totally unrelated. Either way looking at other aspects of how and why you feel the way you do may help you grapple with them.,leaves,ckk4pzf,1,t5_2s9i3

On day  I almost caved and brought weed because I somehow almost convinced myself that... My addict mind will use anything to try to convince me that I should smoke. Thats why Ive quit. Moderation doesnt work for me its just a constant battle. Easier to keep a tiger in a cage than on a leash. Ive tried to moderate so many times  it just doesnt work for me its like a torture of slowly getting through the first few days over and over again. Im just keeping on quitting now and its getting easier and easier  no way do I want to go back to day  again. Moderation is for those who can have a puff occasionally and walk away without looking back. If you are going to continue trying moderation I wish you the best just please dont get lost in the haze and find yourself waking up to a life thats passed you by. Im in my midthirties and have no idea where the years have gone. gt I had my dealers number all pulled up and everything before I thought WTF am I doing?! and put it away. I can at least be proud of that.You sure can. It shows that although you have the addict mentality the voice thats badgering you to smoke the real you can take control and say no.gtIts just that the idea of leaving it all behind is kind of intimidating and scary to me. To think I might never feel that buzz again.....Tell me about it! But I dont need to borrow problems from tomorrow so I just dont think about it  who knows what may happen. Every day I make the commitment to myself  I will not smoke TODAY. Ive said that  days in a row now. Today is all I have and I just have to get to bed straight today. Its getting easier.gtHow about I actually bring my GPA up and work hard and go get into a PhD program rather than lying in bed stoned assuming Ill totally do awesome in life even though I dont do squat with my time besides smoke.You are insightful.

2873322,0,t1_cnubwj4,Thanks! In answer to your questions What made me decide is the insight that weed makes you okay with every life circumstance and I wanted to change mine but it wasnt happening. I also realized weed was my number  avoidance strategy and I have a diagnosis of avoidance personality disorder. I just decided enough is enough and took that bitch head on. You aint the boss o me. My motivation came from feeling a little better every day. Taking it one day at a time was the best tip Ive ever gotten. Also money in the bank. I didnt take anything to replace weed. Weed was a crutch an avoidance and I didnt want to replace it. My quitting wasnt just a physical challenge it was a psychological one. I did go for long walks while listening to audiobooks and podcasts for the first month which helped a lot with the cravings.Thanks for asking!,leaves,cnup4bb,4,t5_2s9i3

2936849,0,t3_2ts8s3,I initially cut back before I made the decision to quit. Im not suggesting you ONLY cut back quitting is a GREAT choice to make and well worth it despite how hard it is in the beginning. I dont know your situation but what really helped me cut back and finally quit was to stop smoking inside. I loved bongs and had to start rolling joints and walking to the park. Joints used more weed and sitting alone in the middle of a dark park was scary so I did it as little as possible. It also got me up and moving out of the house so I felt more motivated to actually doing things  instead of sitting in my bed hitting the bong all day every day.Again Im not suggesting you cut back instead of quitting but if you find yourself wanting to cave maybe make a few rules for yourself like that No smoking inside no smoking before pm... If you find excuses NOT to smoke it may help quitting become easier  even if you cant bring yourself quit all at once.If you are really dedicated to quitting it isnt as hard as if you want to quit but still enjoy smoking... Make some points of why you want to quit and some goals you want to achieve whileafter quitting. Keep a journal of your progress. Remember the cravings will pass whether you decide to smoke or not. It is hard but it will get easier and is SO worth the effort. Best of luck. Im sorry if any of this seemed like bad advice I thought it might help based on the tone of your post.,leaves,co1xkq3,3,t5_2s9i3

Right now I couldnt tell you all of them but I sure as shit can after I smoked.It making me lazy is a big one but I think the most important thing is just living without a vice. Im just trying to live cleaner so I quit cigarettes about  months ago and caffeine a month ago weed is the last to go. It also sucks when supplies are running low and it needs to be rationed. Even then Im still left anxious because its not enough to get as high as Id like just enough to keep withdrawal symptoms away. ,leaves,co2wcts,2,t5_2s9i3
2953337,0,t1_co3d8gh,Yes I am happy with how I smoke and it is under control. I usually smoke when I know I dont have any really big responsibilities and its not that I cant function and do certain things when Im high but when you are high you some times just lose that motivation you forget that you had to study for that test or maybe you wanted to clean your apartment that day and youre like Eh Ill just do it tomorrow but then the same things happens the next day. If weed is getting in your way from having fun and doing things you enjoy then why do it? Some people say smoking makes all the things they enjoy doing even more fun but if you are truly unhappy then its not silly.  I have friends in the same boat as you. One of my friends wont do one single thing without smoking beforehand. His smoking is not under control and frankly neither is his life. Unlike you though he doesnt see that he has a problem whether its a small problem or not. I think he has forgotten that it feels good to be sober too. I love smoking but you gotta stay hungry and make that money.,leaves,co3t43x,1,t5_2s9i3

2976525,0,t1_co6fyey,I see your point. But IMO with that logic we should demonize weed and make it sound horrible and terrible in every thread as much as we can even bordering on making stuff up why not? the means justify the ends of quitting?If we make it unrealistic people wont relate. Some people relate to different things than others. If someone reads my post that says  You can have your shit together and smoke weed constantly though. Not for everyone. And decided to start smoking again that person didnt really want to quit.You should have your own reasons to quit this bulletpoint shouldnt be enough to change anyones mind. If it does he hasnt hit bottom yet and will smoke again no matter what. Thats my opinion.Edit Im a bit sick of seeing every post be of people with mental problemsdepressionanxietyetc. Some people are normal people who just want to quit for healthfinancialmotivation reasons.

3024817,0,t1_cobhvy5,Sounds like a good first step. I remember my first time giving myself over to professional care. Was scary at first. In my very limited experience psychiatrist will try to help you with medication and psychologist will rather try therapy but thats probably painting with a very broad brush.I have some good friends actually my very best friends that I rarely see these days. A big part of that is that I dont smoke or drink. They are swell people and if taking drugs were consequencefree for me Id hang out with them. But it isnt for me. Today I know what happens when I use. And I also know I will use if I hang around smokers long and often enough.Its about assesing yourself honestly and applying the results to your life. They are not bad people for smoking you are not a bad friend for stopping hanging with them. What was once right might be bad for you today. This is about you and your life.This is one of the things I meant before about many of the posts here. People want to quit but they are not ready to do what they know from experience needs to be done to stay quit.I too smoked to numb myself. I just could no get along with life itself and with myself. Today I get along with myself and being alive in way that I could have never imagined. There are bad days of course but I experience a completely different world in comparison to a few years ago. Back then I wanted to die pretty much every day and today I actually am happy to be alive.Keep us updated man! Good to have you here ,leaves,cobipld,2,t5_2s9i3

Heres an excerpt Ive just started day  soberDay Day by day minute by minute.You are part way through the battle!This is the beginning of the second week of not using. One week down and accomplished. One of the worst things people do when they stop using is tell themselves theyll never get high again. Rather than making such giant commitments its easier to take your decision day by day. Soon youll see that you can begin to take it week by week and even longer after that. You are on your way to making a life long decision.If for some reason you were locked up for a month and couldnt get high you know that while you might have some trouble you would survive the experience. Maybe you could go a year without getting high if someone offered you a million dollars to stop! These situations are makebelieve but they show that a large part of kicking the habit is the attitude you have about it. Having the right attitude  a positive one that is willing to look at the shortterm and longterm benefits of stopping  will be a great help in beating use for good.It is also a good idea to have in mind some kind of plan for how youre going to avoid giving in to that one urge to get high. One of the best ways to avoid giving in to an urge is to put off getting high altogether. Promise yourself not to give in to an urge to today. Keep busy! If you do slip put it out immediately. Sometimes we have to go back to a minute at a time. Start over.Theres a bunch of stuff in there including how to feel proud of your achievement as you go because it is an achievement practical tips and aspects of kicking the habit that you may not have thought about.So good waking up in the morning and being able to click on the next day.

3209180,0,t3_2wvjvp,I got sober after  years of denying it was indeed my biggest addiction. I went to AA  because I also identify as an alcoholic and an opiate addict.  AA was the foundation on which I built my Sobriety.  Some people dont want to go to  step programs  to each their own.  But thats what worked for me.  My advice to you is to make some space between you and your smoking buddies. Engage in your other hobbies  dont go nuts trying to change everything all at once eating well  exercising quitting cigarettes  I notice people do that all the time and it back fires.  Know that when you feel like you want to smoke or cave  if you wait like  minutes that craving will pass.  Most important thing to remember is you will be OK  you can survive this.  You can persevere.  Continue to reach out man. ,leaves,coumpk5,3,t5_2s9i3

Seeing as you have  year old to think about Im assuming you arent serious.If you are you need to be taking professional support. What do your parents do about your situation? How can you support a daily habit if you are not working?The alternative is to tough it out a few more days will make all the difference.Look at the post histories of others on here and see what they say and how they dealt with things. Very few of us quitting have had an easy ride getting through the early stages.You appear to me to need someone you can trust who will guide you without you having to be the sole judge on what are the options available to you. You seem to be inclined to selfdiagnose and then as a result recommend the solution. This approach by your own admission does not seem to be working so far.Theres an old saying  If things dont change theyll stay the way they are.Good luck and let us know how you are doing over the next few days. Weve all been there perhaps different circumstances but emotionally we understand here. Go to your doctor again speak to family again.

I regretted it straight away and told my other friends that I was quitting and that next time I come over to please try and not let me smoke. I havent gone out and bought weed for a long time I dont even have connections anymore more of a social smoker but still pretty much daily  so now that one friend has quit with me and the other knows that was our last sesh I think its looking good from hereAwesome about the extra energy thing Ive found my days are about half an hour longer since I wake up and just get straight out of bed  its a weird experience. Yeah the sleep can definitely be an issue have a look around this sub for tips Im sure there are many  I would probably just get some sleeping pills but better if you can learn to naturally fall asleep. Sometimes when my mind is racing I try and realise that I still have eyes if that makes sense like I will focus intently on the blackback of my eyelids it kind of helps to draw me out of my mind a little but I have pretty bad sleep so Im not the person to be asking.Anyway thanks for replying the fact that I would have to be answering here was actually a deterrent from smoking any more than a few bowls with my friend keep up the good work ,leaves,cph8elq,1,t5_2s9i3

He says that he is ok with this and they start up a relationship. Years later despite their earlier agreement he starts mentioning it more and more and pressures her to have children. He finally gives an ultimatum and she must now choose.Not quite fair huh?If youre ok with giving up weed tell him so. If not then tell him too. If youre ok with giving it up then do it  but communicate that giving ultimatums about decisions that have already been decided is a shitty thing to do.Quiting weed will have a positive effect on your life. Once you adapt youll feel happier healthier and more productive. This however should be your decision and yours alone. You shouldnt be forced into anything.Good luck!

3529780,0,t1_cpuca46,I completely understand your opinions regarding personal time vs. work time. However short term memory is a really big deal when you youre caring for multiple patients which you will and there are multiple things come up simultaneously at which point youd have to triage. It was hard to deny my increase in cognitive function when I went from a regular user to not smoking at all. Also the board may argue that personal habits like smoking could view you as unreliabile in terms of stability for the future and that habits MAY seep into your work time. Like what would happen  years from now? even though  of users dont escalate into controlled substances the ones that do generally  started by smoking and even though that most likely wouldnt happen to you doesnt mean that theyll risk it.They may also argue that if you have no issues breaking federal laws and BON policies that it may show a disregard for other laws and policies that protect the public from poor care. Like I said before I understand your opinions and sort of share them myself in a way but the fact is the BON will not change and even in places like Colorado they still hold the same standards for licensure. I know that youve probably worked hard to get into the program and your courses and clinicals now arent easy. But youve most likely found all these things worth it because youve realized that you want to be a nurse and youd find it would make you happy and fulfilled. So if this is the case there really shouldnt be a valid argument about wanting to stop smoking. I was definitely in the same  place as you at one point and had to really think about what I wanted for my life and what would truly make me happy and now I could never imagine looking back or regretting my decision. ,leaves,cpumah7,4,t5_2s9i3

3552543,0,t3_30xztz,Ah you guys... I fucked up a little bit today I was upset because I felt like I was being treated poorly by a family member and they failed to see the issue. Pot really started being a problem for me a couple of years ago when my younger brother started showing signs of Borderline Personality Disorder. Hes doing a lot better now than he was and hes all the way on the other side of the country at school but still the family dynamic is pretty delicate. We talked on the phone yesterday and he interpreted a small comment I made to mean that I was against him and the whole family was too and this morning my mom told me that he called last night so worked up and despairing and suicidal. My family is really angry with me.I smoked weed today after trying to smooth things over with my parents. I felt like the whole argument had happened in this bizarro nonsensical world where I could be blamed for my brothers feelings and reactions. And since I already fucked up today do I go buy pot now? How do you guys handle missteps? There is an MA meeting tonight I meant to go to but what if the people suck and I decide that I think Im better than them and then go buy weed? Maybe safer to barricade myself in my house?,leaves,cpx7oxz,2,t5_2s9i3

4629293,0,t3_3edu6i,I was exactly where you are two weeks ago.Ill give you a few tips that helped me.Wake up in the morning. Dont sleep in  wake up at a reasonable hour am for me. Then go for a jog  or if you cant manage this due to nausea maybe a long walk.That will help to make you hungry and tired which you are probably relying on weed for otherwise? I know I sure was.Then take a shower. Those feel good even when you think you cant enjoy anything without weed. Cleansing yourself will feel good especially if you were able to exercise and sweat a little bit. After this plan a full day. Run errands. Read a book. Grab a meal with friends. Listen to some music. If you get tired take a nap but no more than a half hour or so. Literally anything is more productive than smoking.And then between pm and midnight go to sleep. If you have trouble sleeping keep trying. Dont go on your phone. Dont go on your computer. Reading can help but whatever you do dont give in and smoke! Youre almost done with the hardest day.And then wake up in the morning and repeat. I promise you every day gets a lot easier and after a week youll be feeling great. If you need to chat with somebody feel free to PM me. I hope this helps. Best of luckGPS. Get rid of your gear. Its expensive yeah but if youre serious about quitting throw it in the trash. Its a lot more expensive to fall back into heavy smoking habits. ,leaves,cte3dhc,3,t5_2s9i3

If you take even the tiniest toke and think I can do a little now and itll slowly taper off... itll almost immediately lead to well I came this far whats one more hit and the cycle continues.Drinking will be easier than eating imo. Force water down and if it gets thrown up it gets thrown up. Id recommend drinking milk so you get some calories. Liquid calories will be easier to ingest. If milk isnt enough Id recommend getting a small tub of muscle milk powder and drinking with milk or water. The sweats suck and I know this first hand. If youre having spasms and puking it sounds like you smoked way more than I did which is all the more reason to follow through with quitting!! The tough times are tough but TEMPORARY. Get the hard part out of the way on your road to recovery. If you dont quit for good now youre going to wake up and wonder where the hell your life went. Keep on keepin on brother.

Quitters have slip days thats just how quitting works. On the other hand knowing that is no excuse either  you have reasons you want to quit. At those times are those reasons important to you? Here are a few things Ive noticed anecdotally Dont be afraid to be without weed. It is surprisingly fine. Youll might really like who you are after a couple weeks too. Have you noticed quicker wit more observant etc? Its nice isnt it? Break rituals. s just a time etc. Whos really giving  you permission at the usual times and places? Does that really make it ok? You can own the context of these places you usually do it. They can be what they were before you started. Dont do it opportunistically. You know when you werent really planning to light up but you found a perfect chance. So? You dont smoke so thats like looking for where to land your helicopter  it doesnt matter.And thats another thing. Its your life and you get to decide what it means. You can try to quit try to win the struggle or you can decide youve stopped using it. You need no permission from the drug to stop it. There may still be days where you do use it  try to have a good reason for it like serious nausea or something. The other times you wont have that reason and you can go back to not smoking.I wish you strength and luck and you know this place is here to support efforts like ours.,leaves,cu91giw,6,t5_2s9i3

Therapists are legally binded to keep everything you say to them confidential. You are not going to go to jail for saying you bought illegal marijuana from a dealer and your dealer is not going to get posted up from you talking about him.. Unless you explicitly tell them to they are not going to go and tell your parents everything you told them. Again they are legally obligated to keep everything confidential.. If you are worried about someone in your house opening your mail for you and finding out everything one thing I did was simply give the address to a close friend that I trusted. Even if they read my mail my closest friend knows that shit about me anyways and they wouldnt judge me for taking action to maintain my mental health. Thats what having good friends is all about.. Breaking down emotionally in session. This is something therapists are very good with dealing with and in most cases they will be the best people to help you get through episodes like this. In the last year that Ive gone to therapy Ive broken down at least six times and every time my therapist has been able to help me think clearly. Youd be suprised how therapeutic it is to break down and have someone talk to you and know exactly how to talk you through it make you feel better. I feel like those are the types of scenarios they do their job for.. This is something that comes up a lot with people thinking about seeing a therapist Dont feel stigmatized for seeing one. If someone is going to shit on you because you are actively seeking ways to keep your sanity then chances are they are a shithead and dont deserve your respect anyways.Tony Soprano had a therapist and he was one bad dude.,leaves,cun4vsk,5,t5_2s9i3

5155214,0,t3_3llv0m,Hi there. Yes your story rings a bell!I was a  year pothead until  months and  days ago. I also quit tobacco after  years of cigs and tobacco smoking. I picked up the regular weed habit at age  after coming out of the military in UK.At around the  days mark I look back now and that was the time when I think I finally started getting comfortable and in more or less full control. I felt like I had a couple of times before at about  weeks then  weeks or so. But as it turned out they were premature and i almost caved at those stages. Then I had a little wobble at about  days which only lasted a day or two at most and after digging in for that I have not looked back since. Freedom. At last. A dream for years never had the will or the enthusiasm or belief or whatever it was and couldnt see the day when Id be writing this post. But here I am.What else are you doing to lose the weight? I had a similar issue not quite as much as you but Id put on about a stone about a half in recent years. I upped the physical work out stuff and all it did was stem the increases which was good. But then after I met up and spoke with one of my older brothers he suggested cutting sugar out of my diet. I did that and Ive lost lbs in just over a month! If I keep that going Ill be back to my desired weight by JanFeb next year. I also remembered an old tip my Dad gave me as a kid. I was so into physical fitness and training and he warned me against to much strength type training saying that muscle is heavier than fat which it is. So be careful if you are lifting weights doing lots of reps with things like pushupspullups etc.. as they increase your muscle mass. You might already be doing the right stuff workout wise. But just in case you missed something!So cardiovascular endurance stuff high repslow impact stuff swimming bike running aerobics etc. But leave out the sugar if you can and eat plenty of fruit veg and drink healthily. You can get rid of a lot of stuff that way from your system if your digestion system is functioning well. I wont elaborate on that Im sure you get the drift!Good luck and keep it going mate. Youll soon be rejoicing about breaking free for good. It wont be long now youve done the vast majority already.,leaves,cv7e928,1,t5_2s9i3

5245171,0,t1_cvi76lc,No but I did coincidentally study stuff that would help me a lot in that field psychology statistics.  It just kind of worked out that way.  Poker was always something I was really good at but I considered it a hobby.  I went to school and studied those subjects to try to get a social justicey job and help the world but things didnt work out that way.  I was extraordinarily naive about how the world works and horrendous at politics sucking up to bossesprofessors.    Poker offered me a door out where life was a true meritocracy and politics didnt matter so I decided fuck it Im going to try it.  I try to be philanthropic with the money to make up for the moral dilemma of playing.  I think part of the reason my smoking has increased so much is because being in a casino all day and taking other peoples money is a messed up way to live even if youre giving a lot of it back to charitable causes.  Youre directly bringing so much unhappiness to other people you grow to know very well and sometimes play with every day and the happiness brought to others through monetary donations isnt salient at all.  Also the swings can be brutal and casinos are just a depressing place to spend ones time.    Im grateful to have poker in my back pocket but id like to use my education someday to at least teach or something if I can find a job doing so.  Still trying to figure out whats best in this life like everyone else I guess.  ,leaves,cvi8deu,3,t5_2s9i3

5394793,0,t3_3ov987,For me its a dissatisfaction andor boredom with sobriety. Dopamine is a reward response. The lack of stimulation from the happy neurotransmitters causes a horrible empty ennuitype feeling that drives cravings. You have to because its a primal instinct to seek that which yields reward. But you have to realize that youre cheating yourself and messing with your neural response patterns.  People post here all the time because they dont feel pleasure the same way anymore.  It sucks to wean yourself off it  life sucks in comparison. But that will change with time. You will restore balance and retrain your brain. Its all about challenging yourself to overcome the primal urge. I always had to ask myself is my willpower really so weak that it cant stand up to some pathetic shadow of past pleasure?... am I a slave to my base urges? And the answer is always no. Your will is always stronger but you have to choose to exercise it. Thats all. ,leaves,cw18tx2,5,t5_2s9i3

5550298,0,t1_cwl0y1h,Oh wow thanks for following up! It really helps when someone is out there genuinely caring about how youre doing and Im going through a phase where I can connect to neither my family nor friends. I am not really too open to my family about what I used to do and what Ive been going through and the company of my friends will just make me want to relapse or at least miss doing things.ampnbspAs for how things are going I have actually shut myself down in my home mostly my room last couple of days. I play video games on my laptop watch movies listen to music and eat whatever there is at home. The reason is if I go out I fear I will relapse as temptations are strong. But obviously I am not going to keep skipping classes Im a college senior and stuff and eventually start going out more. I also have not been ordering too much food home or binge eating which is an activity directly related to my filling a void. Instead I am choosing the fill the void with video games exploring some old classics again. I am not really that much of a gaming addict and though this is very similar to eating and eating to fill the void and kill time I think this is something more manageable and less serious for me.ampnbspSo temptation and cravingwise Im doing surprisingly well. But this is because I have shut myself in and have no contact with outside world or friends where I may come across a choice to say yes or no to doing something. But Im building up confidence and eventually maybe  days will start going out and continuing my routine activities as regular. On the other hand healthwise I havent been seeing any physical manifestation of withdrawal but there is some in my though process. I guess I am clear now which has actually made my thinking more fuzzier than ever before. Im less articulate more grumpy less confident and feel less like myself than I used to while on something. But I guess thats what Ive got to change that I had gotten used to thinking the me on substance was the real me and the sober one is a stranger. Ive got to reconnect with this sober person and rediscover who I truly am.ampnbspAnd as I am writing this I guess I realize how much Ive kinda missed talking to people and connecting. I really havent had the chance to talk to people last several days as Ive been indoors and only texted one or two friends for a few minutes online. So I guess I am writing all this less as a reply to you and more because I really want to say all these things maybe to myself. It doesnt matter if Im saying it to you online or just in a notebook as long as I get it out but I dont do notebook so this kinda feels good like some sort of an emotional release.ampnbspAnyway thanks again for asking and thanks for caring. I am doing very very well and hopefully things will get better as I start resuming my regular life soon.,leaves,cwl2drj,1,t5_2s9i3
5566303,0,t1_cwmzyu3,Good input although Id like to add a few thingsI have worked with many clients that have now succeeded in moderating alcohol versus their marijuana use. I helped them quit abusing marijuana and I wrote plans for them as to how to incorporate marijuana back into their daily lives. I did everythingI made them an exercise plan a supplement guide to clear THC as fast as possible after the session etc...It simply didnt work.My plan called for using once a week on Saturdays. I limited the quantity to one bowl per example.Some make it one month before bingeing. I had a guy that made it  months before making rationalizations as to why not also use on Fridays since its the weekend anyways. The fact that they were abusing THC in the first place shows that they were incapable of moderation.Many clients also abused alcohol with their marijuana use.They have now successfully incorporated one or two drinks a week which is successful moderation. They havent lost track.They havent gone wild with their drinking. I would now argue after more than two years of THC sobriety that marijuana is a chronic drug by its very nature simply because the THC lodges itself in your brains fatty tissues for up to  weeks after a single use.Alcohol is excreted at the rate of an ounce an hour. Many medical professionals call marijuana a depot drug because it is excreted as a toxin in fatty tissues for a long ass time versus alcohol that is metabolized as sugar.Id never have gotten addicted to weed if weed had a hangover like a night of binge drinking does.That was one of the arguments from potheads that I clung onto when I started smoking. It was such a slippery slope. The main arguments that are constantly repeated by users There is no hangovers like alcohol. Nobody has ever died from it There are studies out there that show some people died of strokes from THC. Its from the ground. Its natural Just like arsenic.The fact that it doesnt cause a hangover does not mean that it is safe. Tobacco doesnt cause a hangover although it is extremely addictive just as you can enjoy a glass of alcohol here and there without getting drunk or hungover.,leaves,cwn1u32,1,t5_2s9i3

I dont feel all there yet but everyday gets better.I think you are right in that other factors may be affecting your ability to feel the benefits the rest of us are but take small steps to change that.Focus on something that can be an outlet to make you feel good. If you dont feel ready for a full fledged career yet than apply your business skills to something like retail management or start small and work your way up to that. When you do the confidence you get from doing a good job will allow you to move up the ladder and will benefit other aspects of your life. I also believe you should talk to somebody about depression a counselor would be good but im here if you want to message me as well Clarity comes with a good diet sleep and exercise so if you arent or cant do those things then maybe thats why. Take steps to get to that position.Get treatment for your injuries if you can afford to anxiety decreases with confidence and confidence stems from many different facets. Dont give up on yourself. Im happy that youve come this far and realized you can be better but do not go back to your old ways or you will be even more depressed when you try to get out of the fog  or  years down the road when its even harder or seems more pointless.Good luck and like i said message me anytime,leaves,cwtpo93,1,t5_2s9i3

And as for college I would honestly say that as long as you are able to get good grades work like  hours a week or something and are happy then you can smoke. But eventually you will graduate and realize that many legitimate jobs will drug test and maybe randomly. So this isnt something you can do for long.

I was scared and lost and didnt know what to do with myself when I first quit. By the end of the first month I was starting to stabilize. All those things are really good healthy habits. But none of them really address where you were before. I am maybe an outlier on this board but I think that there is a lot to be gained from AA or NA. Even if you dont feel like going to a meeting I think reading the AA Big Book or some other recovery oriented book is worthwhile. You get so much clarity from reading about people whose thought processes mirror your own in addiction. And then you see these people say that they got healthy and happy. That gave me hope in a way nothing else really could and hope was vital to me starting to feel alright.,leaves,cxydxur,1,t5_2s9i3

Theres also the chance that smoking was a way of masking my underlying depression and anxiety. After a while I was just smoking to feel normal. Which usually consisted of a lack of emotion and paranoia. Treating yourself like your sick is a great way to look at it.

One of the reasons why i got into smoking was to combat this anxiety and unfortunately I realized that it became habit for me after a while. The brain is weird man. But thats what we get for having brains not that its bad rather its just the way our minds think. What helped me was accepting the fact that I sometimes have thoughts that dont help me but understand that those thoughts are just thoughts.Im on my second day of being sober wed th was my last bowl and its a challenging experience for me so far.

6210691,0,t3_40n6c1,Im  days in and have had plenty of opportunities to smoke. My roommate still has the daily habit. Many of my friends do too. I went over to a friends house last Friday to make dinner and play some music and his friend who smokes a lot came over and was almost immediately asking my buddy if he could get out the grinder and bowl and light one up. Hes used to me smoking though I had already told my friend I had stopped so when he gestured for me to take the bowl I said No Im good. Later that same night he did so again and I said Nah man Im not smoking anymore. He was very surprised and asked me why. I just went through the laundry list the main point being that I didnt want to be a slave to a need of weed anymore. Attachments are hard to break. But when you realize you want to when you really want to live free from any and all addictions and attachment you will see why this is a positive step. It had become a burden for me to need to smoke to need to keep some around to be able to get high when I wanted to. I now realize that this was just me using some activity to cope with my emotions. And now that Ive stopped obviously the emotions have come to the fore and Im dealing with them head on instead of using pot as an escape hatch.I hope my roommate comes to the same conclusion though hes going to be moving out in about  months to move in with his soontobe wife. I hope my friends stop but if they dont I imagine I will naturally move on to new friendships. Let it happen naturally. Dont just cut people out because they smoke  try to establish new means of connections or simply allow the other connections you have to take front seat.Good luck on your journey. I know it can be overwhelming to come across a place like rleaves and see yourself in the stories. I know that two or three years ago I came here and read the stories and simply thought Ah Im not really addicted and kept up the habit for longer than I should have. But now that Im back here again and have stopped for nearly two weeks and have seen the numerous positive changes in me it feels good to be here and to interact with others who share my outlook. Use rleaves as much as you need to and use your friends and family as outlets for what you are feeling. You can do this. But only if you realize why you want to do it. Id recommend finding the list of  reasons that someone posted a few days back  its a great motivator to see where you can go and what benefits this decision will reap.,leaves,cyvl78g,6,t5_2s9i3

I try to drink chamomile tea before bed and either play or watch something until I pass out.. even if that doesnt happen until am. If you havent already look into things like melatonin meditation etc. to try and help you sleep. Theres a million things out there you can do to help sleep. If its bad enough see a doctor. For the first week I would have a couple glasses of wine before bed which did help make me tired but it made me feel like shit and really anxious because I was scared I was going to replace alcohol with weed.. so Id recommend against that and if you must use that route with extra caution.As for the anxiety find a counsellor. It took me nearly two years of research and digging around but I finally found a place I can get counselling from for free so you should hopefully be able to do that as well depending on where you live. It is a student counsellor but its better than nothing.If I can do it you can do it. Ive been smoking  of my life and it has only been to run away from my problems that fucked me in the ass right when I stopped. It might be one of the hardest things youll have to do but nothing is impossible. You want to quit for a reason keep reminding yourself of why. Dont feel bad about relapsing either just keep pushing forward.The cravings will go away sooner than you think too. Just stick through it.

Youre going to feel much more depressed as you progress through withdrawal  maybe for a few months or so.  And then when your mind is clear you may feel a new different sadness and loneliness as you start to see how empty your life always was or became due to the smoking.

I obviously can control my usage now...over and over for years and years on this roller coaster.for me I finally realized my relationship with weed had run its course and had definitely run aground. no matter how long I abstained when I start back up in moderation it quickly returns to being out of control and me caught in its grip wanting desperately to quit.I have to learn things the hard way unfortunately and this became glaringly clear.how many times I have to fuck up my life lose all confidence in myself before I say enough? weed for me was ok at a certain time in my life and if I had just moved on from there with the insights gained a postive.but to succumb to its addictive side is horrible and for me a point of no return.I hope you can give yourself time away from weed you sound like you have alot to offer the world.dont let the foggy burnt mindset of weed rob you of your natural gifts.you got a second chance at life and have a gift to help others thats special.dont let this plant steal that from you.good luck I know you with beat this.peace,leaves,czyfi1o,1,t5_2s9i3

6731249,0,t3_47rlgo,Good job!  months is a huge accomplishment especially on your own volition and not because of a job or something.  Im glad youve found so many pros... But as someone else mentioned the motivation doesnt come out of nowhere.The way I see it youve spent  years making things more enjoyable with weed or doing certain things because of weedweed culture.  You have to teach yourself to enjoy the hobbies you began to ignore at .  Just grab one of those books off of the shelf and go at it.  This could help with getting to sleep too.As for night sweats and other poor sleep stuff sometimes the timing of your work outs can affect your sleep even in the healthiest of people.  Try to make sure youre working our way before bedtime... Like  hours prior or something especially if doing cardio.Someone else mentioned that it takes a long ass time for weed to actually come out of your system all of the way.  A friend of mine that went through NA and was regularly tested said it took about  months to clear a test after about  years of heavy use.  Youre not alone buddy keep up the good work.  The cons will work themselves out but you do have to teach yourself to be a hobby person. ,leaves,d0fkjh0,1,t5_2s9i3

6751259,0,t3_48554l,A lot of times when we get into active addiction where being high becomes the norm we seem to forget that were designed to live life sober. Pop culture and society doesnt endorse this idea either but its true. Were animals. What other animals get high ever? When being sober becomes a chore thats when we know were in trouble. Wouldnt you be happier being clean for the rest of your life instead of just a year? All youre doing with this mindset is making substances seem more precious that theyre something youre depriving yourself of. Recovery requires changing your outlook on all this stuff to begin with. Itll help you live life to the fullest. The boredom is a natural part of this. When we take away the drugs were left with a void. Filling this void as best we can is absolutely essential to ensure success. Find activities you like. Go outdoors. Plant a garden. Find a cause. Find a project. Write. Paint. Cook. Find other sober people to connect with. Live life! ,leaves,d0hmybs,5,t5_2s9i3

Weed goes from being a friend to a cruel master. You deserve better than that man. I started smoking  years ago and thought nothing of it st the time. Thought it was harmless and then just like that  years had passed and there I was still smoking. I thought nothing of throwing away good cash to buy weed whereas Id have freaked spending the same money on things that would have been productive like on a good holiday. The cash Ive wasted is senseless but while I smoked I didnt care. Thats the catch with weed you sit around doing nothing but blazing but are numb to the fact you are doing just that. I managed to get through college and get a job but Ill never know what I might have achieved if I didnt smoke. All I wanted to do at the end of the day was get home and smoke. Youdeserve better than that. Keep going and stay clear off the weed.

THATs worth celebrating!  THATS what matters not the fact that you have CAVED IN when trying to leave weed in the past.  You spent most of your post describing what you DONT WANT while totally minimizing WHAT YOU DO WANT.  And totally minimizing your giant accomplishments namely  leaving alcohol and amphetamines behind.  You really dont suck at quitting do you?  You have created an optical illusion of reasoning actually.  In fact you are already quite skilled at quitting!  You have practiced gained skills and WON.

It may help to speed up the withdrawal process for pot as well.Ive been taking a multivitamin daily as well as Gabba HTP and drinking water more frequently.

If your afraid of snakes your gonna be scared of snakes until you face your fear head on and expose your self to snakes... Now back to pot. You dont want to quit I assume you like being high. Now the only way to overcome that is too tackle it head on and just stop smoking. I gave my bud and hash away. Cleaned my tubes and put them away in my pelican case. Joined a local MMA gym and have been going to Muay Thai and BJJ classes any exercise works as long as your moving and sweating. Quitting weed isnt like quitting cigs its much more mental. Remember mind over matter. I promise with each passing day it gets easier and you see the possitive effects progressing. I dont know ow much you smoked but each day I feel more clear headed. Another thing I did was youtube some videos on quitting weed and it goes into a lot of the bio chemistry of it and what is going on in your brain during this period.

7671675,0,t3_4kds4x,Welcome to the fold. I feel like we are little caterpillars in a cocoon of smoke. While in the cocoon we do not realize we are living a world if addiction. We enjoy weed we dont need it and it doesnt control us. One day though the idea hits that maybe there is a life outside of the haze. Maybe there is another way weve just been doing it so long that we dont remember why we light up after work any more. Once you get these ideas and you start to build your motivation we begin to emerge. There is another way we can do more with our lives. We can take back our emotions and motivation and live a better life. Emerging is a battle it is a thick cocoon of fog that we have built but we fight for it. Our dreams come back we learn to deal with our anxiety and our mind strengthens. Hard to believe we got addicted in the first place but it is a source of our strength now that we have begun the transformation. ,leaves,d3e83wf,3,t5_2s9i3

Over time the part that misses that toxic cycle will fade.  It may reappear time and again at varying intensities.  The more time you spend not smoking the more experience you gain  knowing the urge may rear its ugly head and it is temporary and you can rise it out.  You will find purpose evrbtually.

This is my third relapse and clearly never learn my lesson. the longest I have gone without smoking in the last  years was  months. Each time I quit I literally lost anywhere from  to  pounds total because a complete lack of appetite its not that Im not hungry but that nothing has flavor and the texture of some foods literally make me gagnot normal things by any stretch of the imagination for me. But at least its not as bad as my last experience with withdrawal last time I quit I was only smoking shatter for at least  months straight at a rate of an eighth a week. This withdrawal was so bad it literally sent me to the hospital about two weeks after quitting due to a potassium deficiency which was caused from not eating anything other than a cup of applesauce here and there the first week of withdrawal. The potassium deficiency caused pretty frightening chest pain and essentially tensed up my digestion track to the point food could barely make it through.the reason I only ate cups of applesauce was because after the first week of withdrawal I would get full and bloated after a few bites of anything. Even after all that I still didnt learn my lesson heres to the both of us staying clean for the long haul!Apologies if anyone found this comment longwinded or unnecessary havent really shared even brief a summary of my weed history with anyone that didnt live through it with me and felt because of your mentioning of food that my story had relevance.Again good luck to all those seeking a better life see ya on the other side!,leaves,d3wojdn,1,t5_2s9i3

8266603,0,t3_4sntwn,Hey man Im really sorry for what youre going through and can see why you want to light up a bowl to take your mind off your ex. In answer to your question I dont think the total amount you smoke is nearly as important as the total amount of time you spend high. Youll likely find that most people on this sub cant control themselves like you do  its great if you can go from smoking every day to only smoking once a week. But be honest with yourself  can you really do that? What about taking two weeks off can you do that? Do you find yourself thinking about the next time you can light up? Do you plan your schedule around it? Theres no hard and fast rule about addiction and everyone has a different amount of highness they want. For me I want to be high every moment of every day but know that its terrible for my life. Sadly I cant control myself so theres no middle ground I cant smoke at all. Maybe you only want to be high once a weekend and can moderate yourself  addicts cant.The most important thing Id say though is that smoking weed will not help your problems with your ex  they will make things worse. Smoking weed to deal with emotional hardship is like taking an advance on your paycheck and paying interest  it might feel better now but youll still have to deal with it and it will cost you more in the long run. If you find yourself using weed to correct rather than enhance your activities you may want to do some self reflection.

What you need to try and do is just break that cycle of expectance gt annoyance. Practically you could try listening to some gentle soothing sounds or soft music basically providing something else for your mind to try focus on. for tinnitus some recommend short sessions of meditation or prayer if youre religious Basically if you cant do anything about the annoying factors you have to try mitigate your response to them.Good luck to youmy prev comment for any interestedhey the not sleeping part is also my toughest withdrawal id recommend getting some melatonin at the pharmacy its over the counter in most places and its normally prescribed for jetlag it basically just helps you get drowsy in the most natural way. another tip is to get yellow filters for your screens pc and cellphoneyou can get apps that do this for you the pc version is called flux. put them on   mins before you wish to sleep. and finally if all that isnt enough. get an audiobook or something you can listen to while trying to fall asleep preferrably something sort of boring or slow paced like the game of thrones novels or old classics  moby dick  the count of monte cristo. theyre interesting enough to keep you engaged but not exciting enough to keep you awake. at least thats my experience.,leaves,d6amxrh,1,t5_2s9i3

That is you have to break the law if you want to smoke weed but once you do you realize that the law is bullshit and you are more likely to go deeper. If weed was treated like alcohol cigarettes or coffee I think people would have a more accurate gauge on how toxic hard drugs are. As it stands we know they are lying about weed so we are forced to try the others out to see if they are lying about them too. And in some ways I think they are. Psychedelics should be treated differently than narcotics which should be treated differently than amphetamines. They are all dangerous in their own way but when we just put a generic bad sticker on them it loses authority. For everything there is a season and for everything there is a cost.

Depression is very common in people who have mental health issues. Have you tried seeing a psychologist for an assesment? Sometimes other mental health issues like bipolar adhd etc can result in depression from not feeling normal or having control over thoughts impulses and emotions. If we have the right medication for the right problem you may start to feel better and not have to take antidepressants. Keep us updated on how things go as many of us struggle with the same things you do. Hope things start to improve for you!Edit Alot of times antidepressants dont help the initial problem that made us become depressed in the first place but just mask things as weed does and many people become addicted to those as well. But this isnt to say there arent people who deal with depression strictly resulting from simple lack of brain chemicals. This is why its important to see a professional psychologistspecialist to be assesed instead of going to your regular doctor and telling them youre depressed which in most cases youll be prescribed whatever type of antidepressant is being pushed my pharma for doctors to prescribe and be told come back in x weeks and let me know if it works. If not we can try x medication next.,leaves,d8jdlif,1,t5_2s9i3

One thing at a time youll get there just dont smoke again.I completely and  feel you on the weekend smoking. I was really close to smoking today Im on day  but I remembered that I wanted to stop so I was doing different things in my free time theres more to life. beers this week each with dinner sounds perfectly healthy. One beer can take the edge off of the craving to smoke. But beware if you get anything beyond tipsy your drunk mind will be like pfff I feel great I dont need to quit wheres the bowl?. You have willpower. Drunk you? Yeah not so much. But hey dude props to ya for day . Im right there with ya dealing with this struggle. But just like youve been doing remember why you quit when you wanna smoke really bad remember it will get worse before it gets better and remember emotional pain is ok. It existed before we started smoking and we dealt with it fine then but when you get used to numbing it with weed whether youre conscious of doing it or not it feels weird to have that pain.

But my only advice is to never give up. there will always be set backs always. All you can do is try your best and you will learn about yourself and who you are along the way. Weed wont make you a better person but quitting will make you better and it will open you up to new things you will suffer if you dont do things to change your life so instead of quitting and continuing your same life which weed made bearable you can make a good change. something im doing today because its day one is cleaning up my room and car to avoid being triggered and also making a list of all the things I want in my life that I can achieve sober. like little things working out trying out for plays getting a job going on a date getting into an art competition getting mural commissions. Just start with self love. Dont hate yourself for not being able to quit just slowly start taking care of yourself be extra nice to yourself even if you still smoke. just be honest with yourself too. but if you practice self care and self love you have a wayyy better chance than calling yourself an asshole and putting pressure on your self ! also melatonin will help a lot with sleep ,leaves,da7hpn7,2,t5_2s9i3

9810539,0,t3_5fqqdl,What I find personally so fascinating about quitting a habit is how unique the journey is for each individual. I think journey is the right word because it takes a willed effort and commitment. Im in the same boat as you smoked practically daily for maybe  years. Used to kill an th in a workweek sometimes less. I got to moderation via a vape and one hitter but was still getting high every day multiple times Id make a gram last a week. So while overall consumption was lower it wasnt any form of self control other than financially. My family knew and I intentionally distanced myself from them even though they still had the heart to let me live in their home. However heres where I think we differ and its just an interesting contrast to one anothers experience.I would tell friends and family all the time I was trying to quit. Wouldnt make it from weekend to weekend there would always be a few drinks and laughs with buddies and next thing you know your burning. I had no discipline sticking to my promises and my friends who all are employed educated and work hard not the stereotype had no qualms about it they got the idea but as a man Im in charge of my own choices. So it never really stuck.So one day couple weeks  maybe . months ago my one hitter broke and my vape needs  pieces to make it work better not even an expensive issue. I just never got around to it and when the weekend came I went camping with my dog by myself. Had a wonderful time just hiking playing with my pup taking photos and just generally exploring. Came home had dinner and just forgot to smoke. Cravings came but I could settle them with just making sure I kept busy doing shit id never do high around the house like prepped my meals for the week. Never told anyone never counted days never really revealed it until I went to a party and politely declined an offer and took a shit when everyone was smoking best avoidance measure! Lmao. But seriously after reading your post and looking back in contrast to my own experience I never was actually supporting myself. Somehow I was deliberately yet subconsciously shedding the responsibility the minute I was sharing my goal. But when I kept it to myself and started to believe I could physically do it myself the relief is much the same knowing you have people there for you and knowing that you actually believe in yourself and can confront your convictions is so liberating.

Theres plenty of extremely successful bright people who have smoked plenty of weed in their past and have no issue with memory eg. carl sagan anthony bourdain etc.. Weed does not ruin your memory at all but it will if you hold that belief and continue to condemn yourself. Practice reading more and develop a good sleep routine.

10218936,0,t3_5maivn,I can totally relate to several points you made on the pot perspective. Have you ever heard of the stoner mantra Weed will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no weed? Ive said it a few times myself in the past and now feel like idiot because I refused to acknowledge the real truth about marijuana. Yes weed can help comfort you at the end of a long day. And it can temporarily relieve stress and emotional pain for a couple hours. But weed also makes you incredibly complacent. No matter how crappy your life or situation currently is weed provides people with the illusion that things actually arent so bad. A big fat joint at the end of a long day can make all your stress temporarily go away.  This is actually the best and the absolute worst thing about smoking weed. Many people spark up to cope with stress or problems in their lives. I know that when things werent going well in my personal life packing a bowl would always make my problems fade away.    But when you wake up the next day the problems you were trying to smoke away are still there. You didnt take action to solve them or work through your thoughts to figure out why you are stressed or unhappy. When smoking marijuana becomes a daily routine weeks and months of your life can fly by and you are content to just smoke the problem away instead of dealing with the issues that need to be addressed. You might be trapped in a miserable job a bad relationship or find yourself kicking it with a crappy circle of friends who you have nothing in common with except you all enjoy smoking weed.  When I look back on my life there are many times when I was smoking weed chronically and found myself trapped in a miserable situation. Hated my job needed better friends and didnt like the place where I was living. But instead of taking action and sending out resumes looking for a new apartment or going to social events to meet new people I would just pack a bowl to momentarily kill the pain of my unhappy existence. Weed can make a bad day or situation seem better temporarily but you wind up being complacent and settling for less than you deserve. And since you havent taken action to deal with the things that are bothering you the whole vicious cycle continues. If you smoke away your problems every day instead of dealing with the actual problems you might spend a couple years of your life trapped in a crappy situation because Mary Jane tells you hey dont worry about it everything is fine.  The only way to stop the cycle is to quit smoking weed so you have the motivation and full brain capacity to think through your problems and take immediate action to deal with them. Imagine how happy most people would be if they found a better job fell in love and upgraded their living situation in the next  days! You wouldnt need weed to cheer you up anymore because you would be so happy with the way your life was going. The big difference is that weed only temporarily relieves your stress and pain. The other changes new job new relationship new crib are tangible longterm and bring real happiness. ,leaves,dc2dh4z,39,t5_2s9i3

Smoking weed regularly alters your dopamine receptors in your brain once your brain has had more time to get used to being sober you will notice things get better.

Melatonin for sleep. Quitting is your no.  job right now. Avoid adding stress and triggers. Dont wallow in frustration or anger thats just your brain chemistry trying for another dopamine hit. Recognize the feeling and remind yourself it will pass. Snack all the time until your regular appetite returns. All the time. Your favourite munchies. Stock up on headache pills theyre coming.

I was tagged in a Guy Fieri meme and told myself it was a mistake to say bad things about Guy on Social Media because now I always get tagged in the same jokes. Then I asked myself why the jokes werent funny to me anymore and I remembered I read an interview with him where he came off like a really cool dude. He was totally aware of his style being weird to people but he just says fuck it he likes it and it makes him happy. Guy also called out Bourdain for a previous interview Bourdain did where he shit all over Guy when they dont even know each other saying I dont like him making fun of people and I dont like him talking shit. And hes never talked shit to my face. I know hes definitely gotta have issues cos the average person doesnt behave that way. ... Its just what are you doing? What is your instigation? You have nothing else to fucking worry about than if I have bleached hair or not? I mean fuck. And goddamn do I agree with guy. Bourdain is a total lame ass he wants to be seen as some punk rock food guy who doesnt give a shit but in actuality he gives enough a shit about what others are doing to try to put them on blast for having a different style than him. ,leaves,ddk3srg,19,t5_2s9i3

When I finally did stop  years ago I was ready.  I could now clearly see the cognitive decline in myself and I made the hard choice between well brain and weed bliss.  I dont kick myself over not quitting earlier though  everyone has his own journey. You have delineated your bottom line align with that and youll see how to get there.,leaves,dernqzh,2,t5_2s9i3

11153862,0,t1_devgfsc,Just for some motivation to go beyond that weekI felt the same way for that first week and a little beyond...irritable depressed frustrated angry terrible dreams night sweats and life feeling super bland.  But somewhere around  days the bad feelings got less intense and my clarity increased.  Just hit about  weeks and I really feel like a new person...more energy clear interactions with people new selfconfidence in public motivation to set new goals no downswings during the day just waiting for the next smoke and finally broken out of missing the routine I knew and loved for so long.  Im still tempted and I know there will still be times when I just want to retreat into the stoned bubble but now I see what is possible for myself and I know I cant go back.  You will get there too!  If you can make it a week you can make it  then as long as you want.  You can have control over your life and your happiness! And you will because you clearly want it!

11391594,0,t3_62iy68,Hey man dont beat yourself up over it. Just know that the one last time mentality can be toxic for your recovery. Our THC addlded brains are great at coming up with excuses to smoke just one more time or just for the weekend or just for this gigfilm etc. Having a goodbye smoke with your friends isnt a huge deal but if youre going to commit to this it would be a good idea to set some boundaries with your buddies.For example dont hang out with them if you know there is going to be weed around or tell them that youre uncomfortable with them bringing weed into your houseappartment etc. It will be hard but if they are really your friends they will respect your decision.Keep at it. There are going to be times when your will is tested but when that happens remember why you decided to quit in the first place.Im in a similar position to you right now.

Just like the people with whom all you had in common was high school will disappear from your life when you no longer have that in common.Youre better off. You may need to make new friends but youre better off.I dont know where youre at in quitting but for me I want to build life patterns that stop me from thinking about weed. The unsurprising secret trick of the people with good selfcontrol is that theyre good at avoiding temptation. So for myself I want to stay away from places where people are waxing romantic or being jovial about their highs.But it sounds like visiting could be helping you a bunch too giving you a way to express your frustrations with weed and how it affected you. So you know do what works.Like you I dont like the subreddit. Like you I lost all my stoner friends. I still have some friends that smoke but those people who were only my stoner friends I dont hang out with. And honestly its deeper than not having weed in common or me wanting to avoid temptation  the things we do have in common for the most part I wont enjoy doing with stoned people.

On the other side I like weed and although I dont smoke much I still smoke every day about a gram every  days. I have pretty good grades Im doing fine in general and honestly can say that Im very good at what I do but I still feel like my life would be better without weed. Id do laundry eat more healthy work out more. But then I still need to relax. I feel more chill and dont stress so much over things. I could smoke less and work harder but Id just be a workaholic. Photography is definitely something you can do high. I study and design my projects while being high and it works out well. not super high but a little weed in my cigarette and morning coffee just hits the spot. Dont think about weed ruining your life. Your life is just fine. If you dont like how much you smoke try smoking less. Its all up to you anyway. Wouldnt blame it on the plant.

The meetings are great for support but the real solution of a  step program is in working the steps which hopefully the meetings will be gently nudging you towards. I would encourage you to find someone you feel you can trust to sponsor you. Shop around ask different members about their experiences working steps what their sponsors had them do etc. As one of the other commenters said there are many different ways to understand the spiritual aspect of the program Ive found that openly sharing in meetings about what parts of the program Im struggling with or dont like has generally gotten me a lot of support and understanding from other members.,leaves,dfzy3i3,2,t5_2s9i3
