190516,0,t3_1w5ztu, Put simply what we are doing here is getting in touch with how things are before we get caught up in thinking about them. Zen isnt a practice and understanding or a philosophy. Its the actual act of seeing into your nature without conception right now. Before you move from seeing things as they appear to grasping with the mind you have an opportunity to recognize things as they are. This is a kind of freedom of mind.    To answer you I dont buy unnecessary things. I dont care for things too much. I like doing things more. I keep myself healthy. I constantly bring my awareness back under control. I exercise meditate eat right. Desire is not fun. Id rather have a shitty belt I dont have to worry about rather than a fancy one that is a problem. People now that I enjoy.  I try and be compassionate when it feels right and I dont act brash or inject myself in concerns that arent mine. Some of this is undoubtedly the effect of Zen on me.    If you cant understand how people live with less desire as if all action is motivated or as if all action necessitates desire that isnt necessarily true. If someone throws a ball at you youll catch it without desire without thought. Everything is like that. Desire itself arises without desire.,zen,cf0517p,1,t5_2qhmf

413582,0,t1_cfnmm7s,Youve got it confused. Whats the essence of the discriminatory mind? It doesnt have an essence. It doesnt exist. It is created by the habitual uncontrolled activity of thinking. A weathervane doesnt move by itself. The wind moves it. When the wind dies down the weathervane stops turning. Thats what Huangbo said  dont overcomplicate it with interpretations! When Huangbo and other real Zen teachers refer to thinking they just refer to thinking. The activity of thinking. The actual experience of conducting a mental theater in your head. The process of remembering projecting forming ideas amplifying feelings and desires entertaining thoughts. Develop the ability to put a full stop to it while in energetic full awareness. Not just while sitting still. Do it in the midst of activity. Thats not blankness. Its blazing reality. Its shedding body and mind then shedding the shedding. After youve tasted this then you can relax and not worry about thoughts appearing or not. Thats what HuiNeng calls nothought in the midst of thought. Dogen took this idea and even its expression directly from HuiNeng. But when HuiNeng wanted to force an awakening in HuiMing he said Empty your mind. Thinking of neither good nor evil tell me what was your original face before your parents met?  Likewise when Rujing wanted to wake up the monks during night meditation he shouted Zen is dropping body and mind both! upon which Dogen woke up. After youve woken up theres no need to empty your mind. After youve dropped body and mind theres no need to drop them again. This is the stark difference between preSatori and postSatori Zen training and most people dont get it because they prefer not to have to make the effort to cut off thinking. cf.

Either he was very dull and the standards of Komozawa University have severly declined or were from different planets. For example heres my curriculum list for study compiled by Kokyo Henkel and approved by my teacherKokyos reading listNow thats the interesting thing too if youre looking for the Suzuki Roshi lineages approach to studying Zen you look at the teacher and the student. My wife for example will do very little textual study and sit less Zazen then I will shes a Chajin meaning she studies Tea Ceremony like her teacher incoming Abbess of Green Gulch. But theres overlap of course. We live in such close proximity we all know a little about sewing tea ceremony making pickled daikan and harvesting potatoes.

445778,0,t3_1z6bkh,Huang Po and PEi Hsiu The Zen Teaching of Huang Po on the Transmission of Mind trans. John Blofeld New York Grove Press  gtMind is like the void in which there is no confusion or evil as when the sun wheels through it shining upon the four corners of the world. For when the sun rises and illuminates the whole earth the void gains not in brilliance and when the sun sets the void does not darken. The phenomena of light and dark alternate with each other but the nature of the void remains unchanged. So it is with the Mind of the Buddha and of sentient beings. If you look upon the Buddha as presenting a pure bright or Enlightened appearance or upon sentient beings as presenting a foul dark or mortalseeming appearance these conceptions resulting from attachment to form will keep you from supreme knowledge even after the passing of as many aeons as there are sands in the Ganges. There is only the One Mind and not a particle of anything else on which to lay hold for this Mind is the Buddha. If you students of the Way do not awake to this Mind substance you will overlay Mind with conceptual thought you will seek the Buddha outside yourselves and you will remain attached to forms pious practices and so on all of which are harmful and not at all the way to supreme knowledge. Bold is mine.Mind is like the void or space but strictly speaking Mind is not void or space. The void is a simile for Minds ubiquitous nature.,zen,cfqyxj3,5,t5_2qhmf

It is seeking for and attaching yourself to nothing as Huangbo said.If you studied even half as much as you pretend to teach you would understand that you dont understand this.  Your zendo tantrum is an example of your fake understanding.Whatever enlightenment might be you have no experience of it.  What you have seen is your own narcissism which you mistook for your true self.  As Foyan said as soon as you approve something you are bound hand and foot by it.So more studying less approving.  Dogen convinced you to set aside your intellect and meditate.  Now that you recognize that such a path is just self pleasuring what will you do?

Thus associations are navigated by abstracting the many into the one  originally for a single statement.   Having invented a new class however  we are tempted to adopt words and names for uses not originally considered.Gleaning the commonality of associations is one thing  but granting an invented existence to the mental grouping is the source of confusion and delusion.   For example archetypes.   The prototype served a momentary purpose but we grant it thingness  and sometimes even personhood  such as gods and corporations.Take another look at the sutras  and see if they arent rife with the Essentialism Fallacy.,zen,cfyfw3k,2,t5_2qhmf

As to Anuttarasamyaksambodhi there is not even the slightest Anuttarasamyaksambodhi dharma which I could attain therefore it is called Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.Huh. Thats a Buddhist sutra read and chanted by Buddhists yet it says the same as Huangbo Duanji interestingly Sixth Patriarch HuiNeng advised people to hold and recite this Sutra as the best way to realize prajna and suddenly wake up. The Diamond Sutra repeatedly says that it is a delusion to believe there is anything at all to attain and that one must see this directly for oneself and wake up. All the Prajnaparamita Sutras say this.In the Wanling lu Huangbo quotes cites and paraphrases this sutra and other Buddhist sutras over fifty times in support of his teaching of the One Mind and to explain Zen.

650520,0,t3_21lbnt,I seem to be the only one postulating that Zen was born from a distinct form of Buddhist logic called prasangika emptiness. I could go into more detail but basically Zen is about a thousand times less confusing than prasangika and still retains all the best parts.  There is some historical information to confirm this.  Thats why it would be historical for some scholars or historians to pick this up and at least correct my errors.  Wikipedia is a wiki which means that the content authorship is often by users i.e. blind leading the blind.  So dont be so concerned as the internet savvy are well aware of the lies being pumped out.

If you think about it it seems to me that the group of elite figures that the Jesus character joins halfway through the film symbolize the way the Illuminati influences the brains economy and media of the modern world.  Jesus accepts unholy desire when he answers yes to the do you want gold question.  It seems to me to be a statement about the endless quest for absolute power and immortality that these powerful political figures seek found only at a holy table on The Holy Mountain.  I dont think Jesus represented Jesus himself in the film but instead he represented what Christianity has become in the modern world a pale and blown up distortion of its original spiritual message.The Illuminati isnt out of a Dan Brown novel like everyone seems to think its just plain and simply a longstanding lineage of power hungry people that worship themselves like gods who feel fit to govern the world like gods and very successfully get away with manipulating war social media economic flow and religion.

This is why psychiatry will never be a hard science.

1026167,0,t1_chkx591,gt Such a break is akin to a J. Krishnamurti breaking from the Theosophical Society.Actually its quite different to that.  Zen masters claimed to have a better take on the Buddhas teaching than their rival schools.  This puts them squarely in the category of Buddhist.  A distinctive type of Buddhist to be sure just as Tiantai Buddhism and Huayan Buddhism are distinctive but Buddhist nonetheless.  For example the importance given the Lankavatara Sutra in early Chan circles is well attested indeed it was from this sutra that much of the nonreliance on sutras rhetoric is derived.  Have you read the Two Entrances and Four Practices the only really early text we have attributed to Bodhidharma?  It talks about karma and rebirth.  Even the recorded sayings also attest to the ongoing belief in such things!Now you might well think that charting the progression of thought from preChan Buddhist to Chan Buddhist castrates implications or reduces something revolutionary to something banal but your criticism should be directed at the Chan figures themselves not the scholars who report on them.I think at the end of the day you have your own philosophy.  You find echoes of this in Chan literature.  But when you look at the Chan tradition in context and not just snippets here and there you see all sorts of things which you feel lose the plot somehow.

There was a youtube video of a guy named Peacock talking about translation errors from Chinese to English that started in the s.  Buddhism was one such error and meditation was another.  He argues that dhyana didnt mean meditation as in sitting meditation before it passed into Chinese.  It meant cultivation the creative act of bringing forth something into the world.  He says that Indian Buddhists who used the word were gardeners and wrote about gardening a lot.  He also points out that in the East the vast majority of Buddhists dont meditate that Buddhist meditation is a current Western fad.D.T. Suzuki wrote a book that Ive recommended to you before based on a shorter essay he wrote.  The book is called The Zen Doctrine of NoMind and it examines the context surrounding Huinengs use of dhyana and how again it had nothing to do with the meditation referred to in sitting meditation.Dogens Buddhism is very influential in the US these days and as a result both Critical Buddhism Soto history and Zen are ignored in favor of Dogens practicemeditation.

1278435,0,t1_cidaw0o,gt Zen isnt any kind of thinkingI am not sure about this.   Sure zen is non verbal  but it can use verbal to express and to play with verbal.    It doesnt try to say what zen IS descriptively  but only seeing can say what zen is NOT.    So zen doesnt stop at the border called words.   Zen can use words   and the conversations of the zen characters is just this.   Now  the tradition of zen has become a stink   and out of fear of this stink  no one is going to say their words are zen.    Others can say it  and over time  that may hold or not.    For example  I will claim that Alan Watts was capable of expressing zen in words  some will agree  some will not.    The ugly word master will come up again  or some other translating convention. Was Watts enlightened  was he a head monk  was his live clouded in scandal?  In this way  even if the stories of the zen characters survives  the zen of  to  CE is somewhat doomed   most people will become frustrated with it before they get a sense of the family custom.   There is no agreement in the family custom  not even the kind of agreement possible with Joslin.   But Joslin and his buddies also want to take concepts seriously.   To draw a map  and behold how nice the map turned out.   Sure  they admit that the map and territory are never the same   but they are willing to compromise  as am I  that certain kinds of conversations about maps can have some value  even if this is thinking about thought.   Zen people remain embarrassed about thinking about thinking  as if to build a thing in this regard is disgraceful.    So the Buddhists call their sutras spiritual to solve that problem.   This is not thinking they say  but an excursion into spirit  sacred.I think that Trivium is using a particular use of the word rhetoric that has to do with descriptions that allow for metaphor.    The worst abuses of the debating style of rhetoric that I am familiar with are implicitly restrained in this method  I suppose.    The word grammar is also unfortunate  in that it implies that definitions are not allowed to seep with the addition of metaphor.   This is an unnecessary self limiting  and it was only by definition seep that the zen characters could find a way to point with their conversations.    But then again  for those with insufficient patience  the translating conventions become a hurdle  and there is spin out all over the place.   You will not get the gratification of a certificate or agreement in a zen conversation or as a result of becoming an expert in zen.   If you did  it would be that you had given someone something to cling to  a doctrine.But there is spin out all over the place anyway.   What people want is  that they can pretend  and to make stuff up  or they can have words to grasp to.    That is actually a preference.   No matter what kind of easier approach or red carpet one might lay out  there is something inherently ornery and obtuse about the enterprise of seeing  its organically like evolution   or maybe like the way water moves as it floods across land that looks flat  sending out fingers  retreating  adjusting its level  and then moving again in ways that are intuitive.    So as critical as we may think our thinking is   without feeling  without that part of emotion that is not coming from a marriage with misconception  the way of seeing becomes something else  the same trajectory that scientism has been on  even the same trajectory that Dick Cheney and Karl Rove have been on.   Such people will talk themselves into turning their lives over to an institution or to a discipline.    This trajectory  even in politics  is becoming as irrelevant as Pat Robinson or a zen buddhist priest.   Sam Harris would like to become a guru on meditation  a person whose version of truth would sell a lot of books.Who is the Jan that makes that mistake sometimes? aboveThe Layperson in the conversation of zen has probably not been discussed enough.   To play a good came of soccer or to do a good job of it in the courtroom requires a kind of familiarity with certain terrains  both arbitrary human constructs and also a basic skill with the foot or with the act of being credible  skills that are not fully describable.   So even mundane truth is a hybrid.    I dont think you have to do this or that.   I dont get the feeling Layman Pang did this or that.  But I think the way zen is presented gives the wrong impression.In my opinion  there are people today who do zen  and perhaps Jerry Seinfeld or maybe a few other comedians might touch on this  just to say  who might we both know about who has a sense of it.    The zen center presentation of zen has been a distraction or a diversion from this.    In his final self published book  The Art of Contemplation  Watts was using a language that had little to do with zen or Buddhism.   I have seen enough of the academic presentations of zen from the mid s to now to know that it will be surpassed  it will have been an immature stage.   Some Christian textual criticism had also gone through this kind of stage  where Christian believers and those sympathetic to them controlled the conversation.   Eventually  their biases get exposed.    We are still a decade or two away from this happening to where the zen characters are reapproached academically without a Buddhist bias. By the time this happens   where will the zen centers be?   What will have become of the Brad Warners?    And would anyone in their right mind identify as a Zennist?    No  a new expression will emerge   one that has a taste of the questions and answers of the zen characters  perhaps someone like Steve Colbert would be up to it.    I am waiting to see a collection of such modern conversations.    Think about it  there have been no new zen cases in  years  the Buddhists were incapable of it.    Will we live to see a new kind of case  a Zenjerk  that twists a nose  that points  that leaves the place speechless in a light of looking  but which has not a tinge of doctrine to it?   Has it already started?,zen,cidfwa1,1,t5_2qhmf

I think what Bodhidarma meant with that line is that you cant keep moving upwards if you wish to go down so dont look for your ultimate reality using the mental tools you usually use to deduce things. Nothingness is the reality. Its your reality. So you could say there is a good chunk of universe that will never be translated by your mind and thats reality but the chunk that is translated is equally nothing. Its just been named like it is something to help categorize it into a way which can be communicated in language.

Or from another angle you could say that Zen doesnt share the rituals and dogmas of others Buddhist sects which still wouldnt mean that Zen has to lose its Buddhist designation just because there are different traditions.The back and forths of zen and not zen on this open forum are just fools mumbling about their conditioned views and subjective opinions.

1694927,0,t1_cjsq1h7,gtHow do we know those texts are more reliable?By those  I assume you mean Gateless Gate or Blue Cliff?   Pronouns  you know  it helps to be clear.    If thats what you meant  well  then  we lay out all of the cases and conversations  and we study one at a time and see where they have shown up  in which collections  and also where they have not shown up.   It shows editorial biases.  This is called textual analysis  or textual criticism.   We can tell which versions are older  newer  we can tell where there have been changes.   We can tell if the commentary is pushing a sectarian doctrine  sectarian practices  sectarian lineages  beliefs  faith  etc.   We can tell if someone is trying to start a new school  a new institution.   Or not.Zen is compared to the sound of rain  to the smell of burnt almonds  so its something a little nebulous from a verbal description point of view  or a doctrine  practice or belief point of view.   Once you get a sense of it  you can recognize it.   Until then  it helps toFirst  get a nose for religious charlatans  the type that spend their time making up doctrine and lineages and practices so they can have religious authority over people.  The type that instead of stealing your beliefs  are piling them up on you yet claim they are not.   If you meet people like this in person or in texts  run.Second  educate yourself about the mythological literature you have read up till now  and that you read in the future.   Learn what you can about the genre out of which a particular kind of literature or text emerged.    In ancient times  as today  literary traditions required certain kinds of communities to exist  often with scholars who were able to translate various languages  both ancient varieties of language  and more modern languages.   Many systems of ancient literature also had a history of prior or even parallel oral traditions.   Part of this second point is that we have modern day guides experts  most often in the academic community  who have learned the skill and art of textual analysis  sometimes called textual criticism.   Some of these experts have financial and other loyalties to particular sects and religions that have a slanted bias towards certain interpretations for the continuity of the faith.   Others less so.So  taking the two points above  if you wanted to start learning about zen  where would you start?   If you had already started  and the modern priest like robe wearers already had you by the balls  what would you do about it?    You might need to have a little bit of deprogramming if you had been living in a Soto zen center.For first timers  you could start off with something like Paul Reps Zen Flesh  Zen Bones.    Maybe move on to the Blue Cliff or Gateless Gate anthologies.   You find the same flavor in the books of sayings of Joshu and Layman Pang.   Start to recognize that flavor a bit.   Joshu could recognize Mazu   Linji could recognize Huangbo.   How?   By the way of questioning perhaps   but its subtle.   If you want a guarantee  zen is not like that.   There is never a point where you stop looking and put the money in the bank.   There is never a point where you are no longer tested.If you can recognize anything about zen  then if you happen upon material from Zongmi  Qisong  Yongming Yanshou or others like them  folks that are preoccupied with doctrine and lineage  practice and belief  authority and faith  starting and building schools  you can look into who they were  when they lived  who they studied under.  Which emperor granted them an ordination license.  Its rather enlightening.   Why are those folks considered authorities in zen?Isnt it funny that in seeing what zen is NOT  that we also can have an opening to seeing into the conversations and the stories of zen?   The zen characters themselves used this approach  as well as pointing.   They avoided sutra like descriptions  flowery Indian language phrases that would be turned into doctrine or used to rationalize certain religious points of view  and used questioning in a way that can be recognized. If you want reliable  then I think you have to go to the Buddhist side of the story.   Institutional methods were more reliable than what the zen conversations were offering.    They alone met the standard of lineage building that imparts truth.    But then that was something else  it wasnt zen.,zen,cjst4z0,1,t5_2qhmf

Even some scholars fail here.I understand your words to be those of a typical Theravada Buddhist who without knowing it doesnt realize the difference between natthaatt and anatt i.e. thereisnotaself and nottheself.Now lets be clear. Anatt is not a denial of self but serves to differentiate between what is not the self and what is. This is how the term is used in well over a hundred discourses by the Buddha. Anatt only means that the five khandhas are not to be taken as our self. Hence each khandha is anatt.  Consider this discoursegtSuppose bhikkhus people were to carry off the grass sticks branches and foliage in the Jetas Grove or to burn them or to do with them as they wish.

1771579,0,t1_ck2avz1,I would tend to think that if this is about the practice of Dana a better option would be to provide ways of donating to the Zen centre as opposed to you personally. Itd still be in somewhat poor taste in my opinion but itd be marginally more in line with gstyles sooner donate to the childrens hospital sentiment. Also on a language level I think its important to be quite clear that indirect speech is still speech. For example the sentence I was wondering if you might like to open the window slightly? is not literally a command or even a request to open the window. Literally it is a statement of you speculating on the others wish to open the window or offering an opportunity for them to do so. But in practice it will of course be understood as a polite indirect command open the window. As humans we get and use this indirect way of talking almost without thinking about it. In a similar vein attaching an if youd like to donate to your AMA can be quite straightforwardly interpreted as blatantly soliciting a donation. I kind of think that some of the word games here work on this level a sort of exploitation of the deniability that goes around language. So if this is about providing others a chance for Dana rather than seeking personal gain you can see why it might have backfired.

I was so impressed with all the health staff. They were so professional and showed great empathy. It really made me want to be involved in that world myself. Problem is here in Australia weve come to a point where there are degrees for everything and professions like paramedicine now pretty much require a university education. They basically dont train people from the ground up anymore. Universities have sold their paramedic degrees to so many people that Ambulance services have so many graduates to employ there is no need for vocational training. I would love to be a paramedic but I feel like a nursing degree would be a more flexible qualification than a paramedic degree. Its a shame. Where do you live?

They ended being like all those selfhelp books that made me waste time in reading books about how to be happy. All that intellectualization and projection of the practice was yet another obsession and comparison between the present and some hypotetical world.Somehow when I read it happens my mind turned it into it should happen and I felt bad by not reaching that fictional state. It turned the practice into yet another religion.Ill learn the bare minimum to keep practicing like the mental training and the rituals to have some respect at those who feel like the religious part is important and to avoid being kicked out from the temple and live the life as the foolish egopositive human I am. Because if theres anything worse than being a fool is being a fool that plays smart. If you ARE an unenlightened fool then go and live your place until you get to know the ultimate truth. Not before. Theres no buddha god that will get angry and punish you for that.Ewk is right in some way. Neither zazen and the koans are Zen. They can be a nice thing to do and practicing them may help you in enlightenment but theyre not the Zen truth. Theyre not the Dharma. Thats a thing youll experience at the right moment but you cant rush it no matter how many beautiful poems you read.Go outside get a bike learn to play a musical instrument get a girlfriend or a friend with benefits learn to cook get a job etc and keep sitting.

Another I used to like was the idea of the brain being a modem interface by which the organism could transmit with intelligences in non physical ways.Another way to approach it  if you get the sense of drama and adventure in the world  the ebb and flow of the tide  is to let it be and play your part  to ebb and flow yourself  in a way that expresses a kind of dance wherever you happen to be.   In such a situation  like a hologram  the parts and the whole are of one  interconnected  and in a kind of communication.   So  there is that  if you need a story to tell yourself.But what if we stop telling any story at all?   Is the wind silent?

This creates a kind of split personality or persona which needs to be maintained and defended. In my observation and experience the persona creation can be quite subtle as it also involves denial of the fact of its construction!Anyway theres an expression get to the root and the branches take care of themselves. Instead I see people decorating the branches emulating zen master behavior by denyingsuppressing preferences denying their motivations and being aloof without having gotten to the root.

There are some things I do that are somehow enhanced by the familiarity rather than growing bored by it.  Perhaps its simply a comfort response I really cant say.  I can say that I find Huangbos approach to discussing Zen is so different from my own that I find him a more challenging and consequently interesting read and working within that context of an unfamiliar framework is a great way to keep me engaged.  So I guess I like it because its familiar in one sense and because its unfamiliar in another?  The username is the result of a typo in a typing class I took when I was in high school.  It was during an accuracy test using random words and the test shot out ad and woodchuck one after the other and I typod ad and somehow missed the space so I had sitting in the middle of my page  sdwoodchuck.

The pen that Benjamin Franklin used to sign the Declaration of Independence.   Thats form.   Simple?I didnt have to say it existed or it did not  I just used the word form to get the point across that it was something easily available.We need to get some kind of a handle on what it is to make stuff up  to believe stuff to imagine stuff  to model stuff as an image in a situation that can also go into memory  also evoke feeling  and also be used in any number of other mental exercises.And that handle is not a perfect objective handle  because everyone makes mistakes  where they think something iswas something it was not.   In fact  metaphysical systems of attainment propose that there is a solution for this like cosmic consciousness  which I do not agree with.Which brings up another matter  that people come to agreements as to what is real and what is not real.   Its a rare person who is not affected by some of these agreements other people have about one truth or another.If a kid wants to do the easter bunny game with me and look for eggs  I am not going to be a party pooper  and I have been known to go to Star Wars movies and have a good time.   So I know how to make believe and pretend.I prefer to keep that stuff over to the side when I am driving down mountain roads at  mph in a convertible.   Its the forms that can ruin my day I am concerned about at that time.Now  I could have a plastic jesus on my shoulder if I wanted to  but that was something I got interested in at some point  so I do take a little more effort than some to investigate the stuff I hear about that other people believe in  especially when it starts to affect the world we live in.   Jesus.   Buddha.   Communism.   Capitalism.   Democracy.   TLDRWhat are we telling ourselves  and can it be checked out?   How would you check it out?   What kind of questions could you ask?   Dongshan points the way.And then you would have to decide on how to use words to keep it clear that there was one kind of way the mind would work for the easter bunny and another kind of way the mind would work for an employment interview.   One of them has to reference the world of form.   When you can no longer tell the difference  that is called nuts.   Believing in the easter bunny or Buddha or Jesus as an adult is not a good idea.

3087816,0,t1_coi02bd,Im not in disagreement with your point of its variety between individuals. That said. Local gods worshipping is not Buddhism but Shinto. These shrines are called kamidana very different from Buddhism. The one for Buddhism is called butsudan which is like a memorial of the deceased family or ancestors at home for the house. Family chant sutras for the deceased which is quite weird especially with Heart Sutra but its our ancestral custom. . The worshipping you may have seen are from other sects of Buddhism like Pure land Nichiren School Shingon Tendai and such they are worshipping bodhisattvas Amitabha Vairocana and such. Tibetan Buddhists worship Dalai Lama. Any case they are not with zen sects.gt Also people frequently light incense for help on an upcoming test or for business deal.Incenses lighting is usually associated with Buddhism but people do not normally pray for tests or business deal at Buddhist temples  except for certain cults trying to earn money from the confused. Buddha does not help you with your kleshas. In general we go to shrines to pray gods for some benefits or to avoid misfortune gods bring and go to temples to pray for the dead and safety of the family hoping the dead ancestors would be protecting you. The closest it has is Mizuko kuyo dead featus memorial and pray boddhisattvas to take care of the poor souls. ,zen,coi1thp,1,t5_2qhmf

3152059,0,t1_coon5ln,For that  why dont you ask about the mythological literary tradition that came out of India and formed the foundation of the early sutras.   Why not study how the sutra tradition evolved.   It is full of meaning and significance.   You arent going to get what those people meant by parsing modern definitions.As far as your meaning  we can only go with what you are willing to share.   Pointing at the Diamond sutra without a reference or context is not exactly making your point about principles.   gtIn the beginning of the DS Buddha explains that learning four lines of this text and teaching them to others would bring Subhuti more merit than if he filled three thousand galaxies with treasure and then gave it all away to the poor.No principle?gtnd Chapter  A central doctrine of Buddhism is that the material world is an illusion and therefore there are no individuals or objects. This is called the principle of nonduality. And since there are no people or other living beings there is really no suffering. In this text Buddha elucidates this doctrine by asking Subhuti questions about the world. One of the questions concerns the number of grains of sand in the River Ganges. Suppose says Buddha there were as many River Ganges as there are sand grains. Surely the total number of sand grains in all these rivers would be immense? But this is a trick question. Sand grains are part of the material world and as Buddha explains the material world is an illusion. Really there are no sand grains at all just as there is no River Ganges and no Subhuti.No Principle?gtBuddha tells Subhuti that their dialogue should thereafter be known as The Diamond Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom. The diamond  vajra  is a symbol of indestructibility and power over illusion. The Perfection of Wisdom refers to a larger group of sutras all preaching the doctrine that the world is illusory. Of course naming the sutra is also part of the illusion as Buddha points out.  Subhuti is moved to tears on hearing this and understanding the Buddhas teaching.No Principle?gtIt taught that all living beings  not just monks  had the potential to attain Buddhahood. Bodhisattvas described in the sixthsection of the text were those who were ready to achieve Buddhahood but delayed their departure from the illusory world to help other living beings attain the same state.No Principles?gtSeventh Part  Living beings are repeatedly reborn into the illusory material world. This is a world characterised by suffering. They can only escape the cycle of rebirth by acquiring sufficient merit through good deeds and words thereby atoning for previous bad deeds and words. They then progress at each rebirth up the hierarchy of living beings to the pinnacle of Buddhahood. Buddha explains again that great merit can be attained through understanding this sutra and explaining it to others.No Principles?gtth Section   As a baby the Buddhatobe Prince Gautama was observed to bear thirtytwo distinctive marks on his body. It was predicted that he would either be a great king or a great sage. Representations of the Buddha always show some of these marks such as the mound on top of his head.   Here Buddha reminds Subhuti that these marks are also part of the illusory world.No Principles?gtth  The final passages of this dialogue between Buddha and his disciple Subhuti repeat the central Buddhist doctrine that all naming or division of the world into separate entities is an illusion. To refer to the Buddha as an individual is part of the illusion.  This fleeting world says Buddha is like a star at dawn a bubble in a stream a flash of lightning in a summer cloud a flickering lamp a phantom and a dream.I find it all very interesting from the point of view of mythological literature  but only a parrot could keep saying that this is where Yunmen intended to go.,zen,coopilz,0,t5_2qhmf

One thing that I dont believe is under much dispute is that the teachings of buddha were given to fit the audience. So here in the west we have a bunch of sutras and manuscripts and documents recording a teaching given to people that had little in common with us. Is it any surprise that misunderstanding abounds. Now one way if rectifying this is to acclimate the western mind to the culture if the time and give sone kind of context to the teachings. To me this seems a little backward. What we need is a teaching designed for us. This is what I believe happened from India to China and later from China to Japan and Korea. Unfortunately this involves a bodhidharma character. One with a firm grasp of the teachings yet sensitive to the present culture. I think lots of people have tried and ultimately fallen short. ,zen,cp00yvw,1,t5_2qhmf

The concept of a zen lineage came about due to the influence of Confucianism and filial piety. There wasnt anything like that in Indian Buddhism.

4269228,0,t1_cs6tiz7,gtUnless you mean that threads that question another users understanding would be allowed as opposed to being deleted... If thats what you mean then I agree with you more than the survey because sometimes people speak authoritatively about Zen in which case their understanding is more important than their comfort. Like as a silly example people should be able to call your understanding into question if you say that Zen is about cats.This is exactly what I mean. bankei says all you need to find truth is selfcriticism. ipeople questioning eachother is exactly an invitation to selfcriticism is it not?gtThe issue then is where to draw the line between hey have you actually read all this stuff? and AMA! AMA! in every possible circumstance.something about the AMA! AMA! that people dont often notice is that he doesnt do it to everyone. Its only a few people that make claims but refuse to elaborate on them. it looks like a lot more because those same people that he always says it to are just CONSTANTLY saying stuff without justification.gtdo you know more about this?The argument is that Buddhism as a classification doesnt really work. There are multiple mutually exclusive religions that are all referred to as Buddhism the argument that ewk makes about this is that those religions are often taking some text like those of the pali cannon as a true and containing the liberating wisdom of siddartha gautama. in zen however as demonstrated by huangbo shakyamuni buddha is just viewed as another zenmaster who isnt to be trusted. Theres a translation thing going on. all sorts of people say they are talking about the buddhadharma but what they mean by buddhadharma isnt always the same. gtits seems like people often say Chan masters didnt do this in order to justify laziness which strikes me as equally misguided.agreed.gtI might edit the New to Zen? section to add some links to some past discussions.probably a really good idea actually.gta discouraging people from coming here to learn about Zen more directly and b discouraging discussion. I think that the whole not Zen thing is a useful perspective but its coupled with stuff like those Buddhists and claim and making stuff up and faith... When people show up here for the first time ewk pretty much ALWAYS sends them directly to texts for people to read for themselves. as for the those buddhists that is dependent on the argument that was made prior. He doesnt mean it as a pejorative its just another not zen. The other three things you said to be honest i dont really see the issue with.gtIt almost feels like a lot of Ewks arguments can be condensed to a specific part of the wiki avoiding the negative tone and educating people about that particular perspective and its justifications. He wrote a book to do pretty much exactly what you said in this paragraph. he points people to it once in a while. he links to it in almost every post he makes.  gtSorry for such a huge reply btw.naw dude I appreciate it actually.Im going to bed.

4603337,0,t1_ct4bh0i,gtgtBatchelor has always admitted that he doesnt accept some primary Buddhist tenets such as rebirth and karma he is real weak on nirvana which are considered by him to be Hindu accretions a claim which most Buddhist scholars would take issue with. Using Batchelors reasoning all of Buddhism is Hindu and therefore needs to be secularized to fit within a modern secular society. Having read Batchelor I do not think he believes all of Buddhism is Hindu gtWhat do you find reasonable in this view? Since I first was influenced by Buddhism many decades ago I was always concerned by the overlapping of  Hindu tradition and their pantheistic tradition.  We are talking about a  year old religious tradition steep in the cultural stew of a  year old religious tradition.  There are roots going back into the Sanskrit texts.In a world where the thoughts and writings of the founding Fathers ideas just hundreds of years old are contextually out of touch with the modern world I find it reasonable to find a need to understand Buddhism within a modern context.  I have never been willing to plow through the language and Hinduism overlays in the original texts of Buddhism. In secularized societies faith lacks cultural authority and religious organizations have little social power.   Wikipedia  the view that public education and other matters of civil policy should be conducted without the introduction of a religious element. dictionary . Com I see this as a reasonable way to conduct affairs. The poster of the quoted comment seems to  imply that this is an attempt to rework Buddhism and strip it of whatever religious authority it holds.  I not sure that is the intent.  I see it more as making the core messages of Buddhism accessible to modern man.As an atheist I find the bracketing off of the theological implications of mind rebirth eternal existence desirable at least for me.  The notion of Mind as the source of existence is for me a solipsism and sophistry.  Saying that in rZen gets you called names.  I find the defense of Mind the return to original mind and mind as the universal eternal causative agent for existence straying too close to a concept of God.  Given the context of the range of gods and deities in both Hindu an Buddhist texts I do not accept such a religious expression of Buddhism.Though I do not accept the tag materialist as it was applied to me in an earlier thread I do not have any belief in existence after death any kind of existence. We are born.  We live.  We die. Consciousness Mind do not survive. Consciousness and Mind are the derivatives of the complexity of the evolution of existence.  I like Pierre Teilhard de Chardins views here.For me there is much in Buddhism and Zen that appeals to me.  I also see the above as consistent with the Tao and the Tao Te Ching.  What I hear Batchelor saying resonates with my POV.For this I will be chastised and ridiculed.  So be it.  We are all lost to our faiths and beliefs.,zen,ctau5x9,1,t5_2qhmf
4603927,0,t3_3e112g,You were okay until you wrotegtThis is in and of itself problematic since for there to be an experience of the Buddhanature it must either be a sensation of sound sight touch smell taste imagination emotion or memory or it must be a logical abstraction apprehended through thought.Our true nature Buddhanature is unconditioned. The senses including the imagination are conditioned and conditioning. How can one possibly behold the unconditioned through the lens of conditionality?The present day culture has degenerated into materialistconditionality so much so they will admit no animative principle tman. Neuroscience wants to believe that consciousness is brain derived which is materialism by any other name.gtWhat we commonly call the mind is a set of operations carried out by the brain. Brain processes underlie not only simple motor behaviors such as walking and eating but also all the complex cognitive acts and behavior that we regard as quintessentially humanthinking speaking and creating works of art. As a corollary all the behavioral disorders that characterize psychiatric illnessdisorders of affect feeling and cognition thoughtresult from disturbances of brain function.  E.R. Kandel J.H.

Deeply listening with blood bones and marrow to everywhere wisdoming he aroused his only moment body of original faith and sat down completely on the firm ground of impermanence noself and nobeliefs. Knowing this trust that the path of universal Wisdoming and the authentic Buddha seal of original faith are exactly the sincere embodiment of Just This. Know that the bright vision of One World and One Humanity is Only This.gtgtAn infinite Source of Vast Wisdoming and Great Functioning shines beyond all human thoughts of clarity and dullness enlightenment and ignorance salvation and damnation atheist and theist believer and infidel. Even amidst this ageless truth branching streams of world religions continue to stir the turbulent seas of species centricity ethnic superiority spiritual exclusiveness righteous aggression and illusory historical dogmas.gtgtGrasping and attaching to the exclusive nature of any religious symbol scripture word or dogma is surely delusion. Yet attaching to a perfect wisdom supreme reason transcendental being sainthood sageliness or absolute Buddhahood is still mountains and rivers from the True Mark. Knowing this arouse your courage to stand on noground embody original Faith and live the wisdoming of your only moment body that is before all scientific paradigms religious beliefs and spiritual views.gtgtWhen practicing the body of original Faith know that your five sense gates receive the five sense objects in One Bright Mirror. Though each sense and stimulus has its own identity all exist independency with one another. Though the infinite forms and beings vary in their nature and function One equanimity integrity and creativity pervades them all. Though worldly sounds may differ as to pleasing or harsh their essence is exactly infinite silence at their core.gtgtThe Precious Mystery does not discriminate superior from inferior sentience from insentience animate from inanimate good from bad. Yet the Bright Reflection clarifies through the duality of shadow and light sinner and saint beauty and ugliness. Within the Precious Mystery the pristine and undefiled essence of all human beings is akin to drifting clouds and flowing waters. Knowing this one may end their days with confidence and ease returning to the nature of Vast Wisdoming like an infant to its mother.gtgtWhen flesh blood bones and marrow completely entrust themselves to the seal of original Faith sitting meditation is just like this As the fire of breath enlivens the spirit in the deep valley a precious wind brings clarity to the mountain peak. As the solidity of the earth nurtures and sustains the waters of life flow easily and nourish the root of heaven.gtgtEyes reflect color shape and motion in a vast emptiness and stillness. Ears clarify and differentiate sounds in a womb of infinite silence. Nose discerns the meaning of smells through the essence of odorlessness. Tongue distinguishes five tastes against the mirror of blandness. Each sense and its knowing arises from One Source as the branches and leaves emerge from One Tree.gtgtBreathing silence and embracing stillness sit in the ancient refuge and witness the multitude of passing thoughts as they spontaneously arise beyond the thinkers control. Letting go of selfjudgment return endlessly to selfcompassion and the wisdoming of each breath. Just like this your original Faith Body will authenticate the treasure of One Vast Wisdoming before your thinking mind written language or spoken tongue.gtgtWithin the light an utter darkness illuminates the endless mystery. Within the darkness a bright light dims the Wonder and the Oneness. Thus brightness and darkness reveal their dual and complementary natures. They are like the two feet walking both expressing the dance of forward and behind.gtgtEach sentient form is exactly a moment body that expresses Great Functioning as its interdependent and unique relationship to all existence. Such functioning reveals the virtue and meaning that all forms are being a True Time and a True Place. Understanding this honor and cherish each being and thing as the Great Functioning of an infinite and interdependent Moment Body of Vast Wisdoming.gtgtKnow that the body of Vast Wisdoming is exactly the interdependency of all forms. Know that the mind of Vast Wisdoming is exactly One creative formlessness. Though form and formlessness are not two they complete each other like a box and its lid. Though they are not One they merge as this Only Moment like two arrow points meeting everywhere in mid air.gtgtReading or hearing these words embody the Buddha seal of original Faith become the wisdoming stream of seated breath and endlessly clarify the Universal Way and the root of true human virtue.gtgtDo not seek clear understanding or wisdom by just applying your thinking mind to these words nor by unquestioningly accepting scientific theories spiritual beliefs or religious standards.gtgtIf you do not practice seated meditation and investigate the stream of breath in this Only Moment Body how will you ever know the True Path for yourself and experientially resolve the great matter of life and death? How will you ever see through the limited views of personality history religion and culture? How will you ever honestly find the Way if you do not listen deeply to the momentary heartbeat and impermanent nature of your living body?gtgtRealizing and embodying the Goal is not a matter of far and near leaving and arriving practicing and attaining. However if you separate the beginning from end the path from the arrival the journey from the destination then turbulent rivers great mountains and dense forests will hinder and obstruct your Way.gtgtDo not keep putting this great matter off for the future! Distractions are endless. The final moment is unknown. Therefore I encourage you to immediately arouse Original Faith and entrust yourself completely to the wisdoming body of seated breath. In this Way you will authenticate your true nature clarify and refresh your deep intimacy with life and prepare for your complete entrustment and ease in death.gtgtAbove all do not chase the horizon of an idealized being spiritual powers complete realization or absolute enlightenment.

They sat like that to fulfill a religious yearning.   Or because they had to   a lot of kids were sent to monestaries by their parents.    But even if they were doing it because they had to   they were told  and often believed  that with Dogens zazen   the significance was that zazen was manifesting the perfection of an ideal  not later  but right now.

5839139,0,t1_cxl15x6,gtWhatever Mind is so also are phenomena  both are equally real and partake equally of the DharmaNature which hangs in the void. He who receives an intuition of this truth has become a Buddha and attained to the Dharma.This is not something everybody knows but a hairraising statement that overthrows most ideas about what Mind is or isnt and what phenomena is or isnt and also what Dharmata is or isnt and what the void is or isnt and what a Buddha is or isnt. There is no suggestion of evading or condemning or putting an end to phenomena in order to dwell in pure Mind. Interesting right? Nor is there talk of getting rid of the intangible Mind in order to just drift along with phenomenal changes eating your rice like a simpleton. Phenomena seal Mind. Mind also seals phenomena! The stamp of the utter authenticity that is your preconceptual being like a box and a lid that fits it exactly. Also the use of the analogy of a seal is quite interesting is it not?

6455650,0,t1_czmfsmg,gtIn summary mind in Buddhism refers to experience namely the mere arising and cognitive engaging with the contents of experience. The continuity of experience is known as the mindstream or mentalcontinuum. It is always individual with each moment of experience following from previous moments of experience according to the karmic laws ofbehavioral cause and effect. There is order in the universe and my experience is never your experience. If I experience eating a meal I and not you will next experience the physical sensation of being full. Buddhism does not posit a universal or collective mind.gtThe neverceasing momenttomoment event of arising and engaging that constitutes experience then refers to the arising of a sight and merely seeing it the arising of a sound and merely hearing it the arising of a thought and merely thinking it the arising of an emotion and merely feeling it and so on. This is theconventionalnature of mind  it gives rise to things and apprehends them. Its deepest nature is its voidness namely that it is devoid of existing in any impossible manner from being a physical entity itself up to involving a solid concrete subject content or experience. Such a mind then with these two true natures  or two truths  is the topic of mahamudra meditation.This is what is meant by Mind.,zen,czn224o,2,t5_2qhmf
6460635,0,t1_cznjvl1,I like the way he puts things he seems sure on things that hes observed for a while and clearly states his subjectivity when its conjecture hes working with.       I think theres room for many different speakers and thinker in these discussions but weve got to recognize that peoples repelling of foreign influence As in outside of Zen Masters is actually a welcoming to it.  The budding Atheist must first say NO! I dont accept your way of thinking! as a first step to shifting perspective.      Idolizing children.. I think Ive dodged that side of society throughout my life but I have seen glimpses most notably in film and child celebrities.  I think childhood represents wanderlust curiosity energy and learning.  Many people as they grow up feel their worldview has been formed their opinions have become solid and through this lose that sense of freedom that comes with a constantly shifting world view.       But I do think that the infants enlightened proposition has a big contextual difference with Adams view.  It seems hes referring to society as a whole seeing children and youth as something divine and beautiful.  In Alans idea Hes the first I heard to bring it forward he does not go on to say the value of this state of mind or its higher quality over anything else.  It is not a positive or negative it just is an observation of an infants conciousness.   However Im sure there are many that would take this and run with it hollering LOOK babies are divine creatures from the pure land lets use them as a model for living! Everybody act clueless!

6539802,0,t3_457g89,First of all great post. Thanks for putting it up here and I enjoyed reading it.But Ive got a few of my own nuts to crack here.gtYes and no is the answer to pretty much everything.This just plain isnt true. Perhaps its the answer to some of the questions which are ambivalent like is everything real? but you dont answer yes and no if someone asks you to pass the salt. You just pass the salt.gtA car crash isnt good but what use is goodness without badness?Im not totally convinced in this. I agree more with the idea of karmic energy rather than goodness somehow balancing out badness it all works in a single mesh. Not sure if you can see what Im getting at here Im totally unclear on it myself.gtMost of us put death out of our minds to maintain remote sanity and contentment.Not true. Death is on the minds of a lot of people all the time. Every time you drive youre avoiding it. Same with many other daytoday situations. Sure it might not seem that way but I think a lot of things have death in them rather than appearing exactly as death.gt God manifests as All death is an illusion and everything is extremely neutral or  There is no God death is not an illusion and everything is extremely bad? Id suggest the neutral possibility is the more plausible one. In the same way everlasting heaven is far too good to possibly be real everlasting nonexistence is far too bad to possibly be real.Huh? This sounds like fear of death talking. I disagree with both of these possibilities. I think were just cosmic energy moving as a single unit without any dimensional boundaries. That doesnt quite fit into either of these models and is kind of leaning towards Yeah dude youre going to die. Live your life with that in mind.gtWere all really dead which is precisely why were alive. Or Were all really nothing which is precisely why were something. You cannot be something without also being nothing and you cannot be nothing without also being something. Im not dead. My mums not dead. Were both alive. THIS is something. Its not really nothing unless you think everything is nothing in which case yeah its still gotta be somethingnothing. Maybe we agree here. Maybe we agree on a lot here. But hey. You asked for critique! Lets clean up.gtThe existence of a finite self necessarily implies the existence of an infinite Self just as the existence of a left necessarily implies the existence of a right. First part okay second part what? I dont agree that boundboundless is the same type of thing as leftright in Zen even the bound is the boundless. Its not a duality. Ya dig?gt Therefore the ego cannot tell by experience whether universal consciousness manifests in disguise in just the same way we cannot bite our own teeth or taste our own tongue or see our own eyes without a mirror.Nah... You cant tell anything really. I dunno about this one. Mind cannot know itself you cant turn that into I know something about this.... I dunno.gtThe real us is either infinite or finite outside the body or inside. It doesnt have to be either. Inside or outside isnt one or the other.gtWere not separate observers were Observation. Were not inside the body were outside. This is the same thing as before. I dont see why youd go from boundless universal energy! to were outside. Way too limited IMO just like a lot of the duality hogging in this post. Just because you cant fit one to the other doesnt mean that ones less or more right.Although I totally getcha. Its a good post. I hope we can have a reasonably constructive discussion and I hope that this post wasnt crying about the semantics when we really agree from the first.Once again thanks for your post. Have a great day.,zen,czvropo,1,t5_2qhmf

Cool.We absolutely agree in that Ramanas basis is not Zen didnt meet a Zen Master didnt study Zen doesnt gossip about the lineage and doesnt limit himself to no dharma.All Id say about Ramana is if a person has found him I say fine Ramana is clean or a hell of a lot cleaner than J Krishnamurti or Sri Aurobindo or Osho or Papaji or Eckhart or UG or  of gurus.If a person really wants to study Hinduism etc. I usually point them to Ramana. He is an authentic representation of the VedicIndian tradition and as such is rare among all that mess. No money crap just ask yourself who am I?. Asking yourself Who Am I? is a compatible entryway into getting to know yourself it brings a lot of negation and is far better than mindfulness.Likewise I was talking with someone the other day and walked all the way through this Doesnt mean I believe in it.

Pleased Shitou shaved his head. When he was completely shaved suddenly the crown of his head rose up of itself. Tianran  spontaneously! exclaimed the astonished master.

Maybe the same general idea can apply to your personal way of reading and you can adapt it in. I dont know.Maybe you should read to clarify Chinese metaphors etc. But dont get too into the intellectual side of things. Down the intellectual road is many beatings of your head against a wall and very little fruition of your own intuitive understanding.

7021474,0,t1_d1c7p1c,I and many others on this forum have put a lot of work into figuring out what his actual thought process is and exposing him.He has inverted the meaning of the texts and he inverts and represses the roles of Master and student in the cases making Zen into something that is a vehicle for his desire to abuse people.He thinks that because an enlightened person is free from causality there are no consequences to his actions. The masters explicitly warn against this in Hyakujos Fox the second case in the mumonkan. An enlightened person does not fall into causality but also does not ignore causality.Since he rejects causality and tells himself he is enlightened he has to jump through crazy hoops to prove that his view is right mean while he takes no responsibility for beating people up.Hes in pain and delusion and he is repressing it and taking it out on other people. I dont think there is humility in there. Dont be deceived. You can get sucked in and it can be extremely difficult to escape.

If you read the Bodhidharma quote I posted youll see that Zen includes both sides when talking about this subject. Not falling into causality yet not ignoring causality.Not falling into causality in terms of your question means seeing that its neither good nor bad if someone steals your wallet. Its only Mind.All types of good vs. bad picking and choosing all of them depend on grasping and grasping is illusory. Grasping is within Mind not the other way around.Not ignoring causality means that generally speaking you dont go stealing peoples wallets just because reality is only Mind. If you steal someones wallet you will encounter pain coming back to you whether its in the form of getting beaten up or going to jail or whatever worldly consequences that come out of that never mind the complications of thoughts that arise from that.

7169892,0,t1_d1t515n,. I didnt say they have any objective value rather just that you should cultivate an attitude of dispassion towards them. Youre correct that its a Buddhist teaching more specifically its Chan.. Ive heard it said that Mahayanist ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth basically.. Dont separate from ordinary life but dont just carry on what youre doing. I really dont see an issue. Dont be looking for some crazy faroff mystic insight just live your life but dont be deceived. Normally you are deceived. Ultimately deception is just another illusory idea but you cant introduce that at the outset if you dont want people to get rid of ideas.. Im not arguing for a common doctrine except in Mahamudra Dzogchen and perhaps one or two other schools. I also dont think that common doctrine follows from common culture but rather that religion isnt reducible to doctrine but can also be approached from a thematic POV and perhaps is actually mostly this and that Chan is firmly categorizable alongside Pure Land and other schools with this approach. There are tons of ways to approach and define religion its not so cutanddry.For example the aforementioned schools do say that the nature of reality is faulty in that it is too close Huangbo says this as well that the mind is unborn etc. that nothing either arises nor passes away that you shouldnt recollect or have ideas that reifying meditation is delusion etc. etc. etc. I invite you to look into it yourself there arent any direct matches for those but there are dozens of sayings that are near identical and an equal amount that are completely alien they are different schools from different regions after all.,zen,d1t5e76,3,t5_2qhmf

If youre inside it it makes sense to wipe the dust off of the mirror but when you see its all interdependent anyway and has nothing to rely on on its own you get to Hui Nengs verse. ,zen,d3ai3h4,1,t5_2qhmf

Principles and practices related to those sure but i dont recall that there is an actual discussion of the school. The Pure Land sutra describes the pure lands and the practice of how to get reborn there but not the school in itself.  An example of discussing the sect would be Zen is such and such founded by such and such and linked to shakyamuni because this and this it is the ultimate truth because that and that.

They are structured in such a way that if you escape from one koan you could be caught by another and if you are stuck or teaching someone in a specific situation you can turn to a relevant example of that situation and apply the method that has been preserved in that case to break through the sticking point.Yes I think meditation as a cure all has a lot of pitfalls thats why masters are frequently advising against it.

7901685,0,t1_d43f4fi,From the default mode network wiki  The default mode network is most commonly shown to be active when a person is not focused on the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest such as during daydreaming and mindwandering but it is also active when the individual is thinking about others thinking about themselves remembering the past and planning for the future. The network activates by default when a person is not involved in a task.So is he saying that the above is or isnt happening? Id love a link if you can spare it! ,zen,d4482mw,1,t5_2qhmf

All is through living a good life and briefly touching in at the right moments. My life is becoming plentiful and I am sharing that with the people around me. Took care of  people since I have a better job easing their transitory periods and that is my work. Supporting others. Lifted people taught people how to manage themselves and not to see themselves as victims. Encouraged people when they were down.There is nothing I can tell anyone that they cant realize themselves sooner or later. Conceptual mind your mental model of the world is not required.

7954090,0,t1_d49qqkk,Thanks friend I thought I read on the Gardens sign    and my western mind set has always associated these type of gardens exclusively with Zen but it would seem the sign maker agrees with you and Im happy to agree with this more broad association.Do you have any historical reading on Zen that you would encourage me to look at?  It seems youre suggesting that there has been a perversion of the roots of Zen from its roots in farming as the practice became more organized into that of a church?  Thats an amazing insight historical documents with first degree accounts would help develop context for a book Im writing.  Im only coming from studying a few masters in the Chan tradition but the Monk Ive meditated with has been obsessed over the decline in la in Japanese Zendos. And there is a local community garden that Im interested in planting some food in too as well as a soup kitchen I intend to get involved with to finish that cycle.  Please do not think that Im going to just pull a few weeds and call it a day your instinct to bring help to people over creating beauty is well founded though I believe they are both part of a larger whole.  Artisans it would seem create great works that inspire the everyday man or woman to enjoy life but we should also make sure theyve got enough food in their belly to be able to enjoy it right?

Which is basically what youve been doing this conversation. Saying the right answer more or less something that is accurate but thats not even approaching what Zen actually is.gtIf you are aiming squarely at Yun Men saying that in the moment then you are in the Secondary.gtIf you are literally able to say those words yourself then you are locking eyebrows with the Zen masters.gtNote I am that is not Six do not take it in.gtAnd Six do not take it in is situationally applied to the monk asking the question.gtSo its different on the count that Men is literally meeting and exploding the monk in the moment that the monk asks the question its different on the count that the statement of what zen is six do not take it in while somewhat similar to I am that is actually completely opposite and its different on the count that Men is cutting off all opportunity to have any thoughts or interpretations about what he has said with a single phrase.gtFurther Zen is different because the culture itself is built around this explosion.Im not a Zen master I dont claim to be either. I recognize the nature of my words what they are capable of eliciting.

You have to live your life completely so that you die completely. You have to live your life without a trace of this dualism so that when you come to death nothing happens.From a buddhist point of view its similar to saying that if you exhaust the karma of this lifetime completely then theres nothing left to create a rebirth from. No thought occurs at the time of death no attachment.gtAlso how can a state without characteristics be a person?This goes into the I alone am the world honored one. also Mu and its just you why revolve your brains when the monk turned his head when his name was called.The question gets obliterated.

Im more focused on the Eastern stuff now after years of reading Western philosophy in my youth i.e. Hume Spinoza Schopenhauer Nietzsche Camus Wittgenstein Deleuze and Guattari etc.. What Im not interested is in the historically revisionist whitewashed secularized version of Zen that gets pushed here as authentic Zen AKA Zen that can be studied. I take Huangbo seriously when he says Regarding this Zen Doctrine of ours since it was first transmitted it has never taught that men should seek for learning or form concepts. Studying the Way is just a figure of speech. It is a method of arousing peoples interest in the early stages of their development. In fact the Way is not something which can be studied. Study leads to the retention of concepts and so the Way is entirely misunderstood... The first step is to refrain from knowledgebased concepts.In this way I am not interested in Zen. I have come to this conclusion after reading the works attributed to Bodhidharma and Huangbo. But as teachers or pointers to the Deathless there is nothing I am more interested in. gtNow you post an AMA while high on benzos...I dont see how these comments logically connect. At all. If I am not really interested in Zen why wouldnt I take benzos to deal with what I already got a taste of in my first AMA which I did stone cold sober knowing all the personal insults and insincere gestures of ewk that I knew he was going to follow up on? Its not about the subject its about the people I have to talk about the subject with. You do realize I spent  hrs and typed thousands of words in my last AMA right? And ewk still kept harassing me afterwards for not finishing it. Can you please explain the logic behind me not being interested in the Zen that gets discussed here and not caring whether or not Im inebriated for my follow up AMA?gtMost of what you post otherwise is long reactive kinda strange antiewk rants...Did I ever say otherwise? I go on long rants about ewk to a better hone my personal understanding and ability to articulate why ewk should not be allowed to get away with the things he gets away with and b in order to try to show others why though the things he says might sound logically coherent they are based on unfounded presuppositions and prejudices like the idea that Zen is secular which over three years since I asked him to give me a citation so I know its not something hes just making up making him no better than the charismatic deceptive preachers he denounces.Im not sure how to interpret the ... you are ending your sentences with. Like are they supposed to insinuate they are something I am not explicitly aware of?

You simply dont bring your attention to them and your conversation is effortless. Letting your attention relax into the knowledge of being both present and aware is peace. Meditation techniques are tricks for it but it is knowledge that you have always had. The knowledge that I am. I am both present and aware. It is the message of every religion. Hindu  Brahman is the one true self of the universe. ChristianJudaism  God said to Moses I Am That I Am tell the people that I Am has sent me onto you. Exodus .Be still and know that I am God.

Thoughts are another form of consciousness. Words dont really do it justice because you are behind consciousness. Words are in front of it. Everything in front of it gets swept away. Coming and going. They are the name and form aspect of consciousness. So speaking about it is like getting into a deep discussion about the color blue. Many words can be spoken but not a whole lot is said. Even the statement of this paragraph isnt completely true. It has a dualistic example. The reality cant really be said to be dualistic or not dualistic. Non dualism has duality as well.,zen,d7ihyds,1,t5_2qhmf

We evolved from allsortsofdifferentstuff into egalitarian humans.did you even read the article?we did not evolve into egalitarian humans we most definitely started off being very egalitarian because when in a world are abundance like the natural world before humans took over the planet you dont need hierarchies.another great quote from the author buried in the comments gt In my lifetime in the US I have seen humility decline and egos inflate in parallel with the decline in free play and the rise in adultorganized childrens sports. Children on their own in free social play dont tolerate bragging and domineering behavior in their peers but coaches and parents seem to promote it as do altogether too many professional athletes. We also see it of course in the entertainment industry with bullies such as Bill OReilly Donald Trump and Rush Limbaugh. I think that the renewal of free social play and reduced emphasis on competitive sports could move us a long way toward restoring humility and human decency.if anything what we did was evolve into hierarchies due to emergent scarcity of established settlements ... and then later covered up the hierarchies determined by existential chance with lies of free will.gt Its an assumption to say that humanitys going to wipe itself out just as much as its an assumption to say that humanity will not wipe itself out.its not an assumption its a inevitability of not changing our ways. as a moral being i wouldnt even want us to survive without changing out ways and cant imagine what kind of existential argument could suggest we should survive all the current sin you will most assuredly refuse to acknowledge. god forbid humanity learns to deal with the negative emotions of criticizing itselfthe world is too full of nihilist idiots claiming enlightenment when really theyre just arguing their own biases.gt Seriously for all you know humans are currently on the right track.

9231178,0,t1_d8m2yup,This is the main soteriological problem of Zen itself. Zen fundamentally epistemologically and phenomenologically cannot distinguish itself from Buddhism without creating an entirely separate religion. What Zen texts are you talking about? The lineage texts? Have you read the Zen Teachings of Huangpo? The Platform Sutra by Huineng? They talk a lot about this subject.He himself asserts that Buddhism in the legalistic Theravada tradition has bastardized the Dharma essentially and that the Buddha was beyond concepts beyond religious doctrines etc. Chan did not purport itself to be an entirely different foundation nor did the patriarchs themselves specifically denounce Buddha nor did they denounce the Mahayana teachings many Koans regard topics specifically brought about by Mahayana Sutras The Zen Sect runs into problems when they try to contrive ideas that their lineage is contrarian to the Buddha Dharma. If they dont claim to be a form of Buddhism then they run into the problem of why did you use Buddhist texts to teach fundamental teachings?. If they claim to be a form of Buddhism then they have to claim that the Buddha Dharma itself or the Way is not a religion which they mostly assert in the texts. The Yogachara school that influenced Chan also was denoted as the Mind Only school as well. Ive read lots of texts and Zen insights are merely the attempt to selfactualize enlightenment without the reliance on sutras or doctrinal teachings. But this is how Zen ended up being militarized in Japan as their unwillingness to admit the fact that Zen was essentially a specific conduct and way of life propped up the militant Tokugawa Shogunate.The main problem with Zen comes down to the metaphysical problems of morality which is why it is said that Satori is the enemy a Buddha. Read the Platform Sutra. There are clear moralistic inferences that can be made despite Huineng not doctrinally asserting precepts. ,zen,d8m4b59,1,t5_2qhmf

What do I think anything has to do with Zen? Nothing too. Anything that is fabricated composited perceivable able to be intellectualized conceptualized or visualized is not Zen.And unlike you I dont claim or insinuate I have broken the chain of causation.

There is ultimately not a point. You thinking there is a point is good if it leads you to investigate the truth to investigate the true nature of reality the true nature of yourself or the lack thereof. To know for yourself and for yourself only. Or to have it know itself implicitly if you prefer it that way. gtIm fine with that considering his audience.Maybe its true that Im making problems where none exist. maybe its perfectly right that he doesnt aim people at complete enlightenment because thats not what his audience is truly after. just some of its sheen enough to alleviate some doubt but not to eradicate everything they hold dear. gtIf every blog post talked about enlightenment and attainment hed probably do more harm than good  I think he thinks he does. He probably sees himself as tying Zen concepts into western life for the benefit of western people. I think it can be put like this. Sure Zen has concepts like the moon the pointing finger enlightenment etc. But what is it that gives those concepts their power their meaning? They dont hold any in themselves.

You cant justify this by saying that you felt that one hermit was offended because this feeling of koans doesnt mean you just add imaginary circumstances that make the situation more logical. What youre supposed to feel is the mindset of Joshu in the koan which is his nonattachment to his past opinions.What youre doing or seem to be doing from my point of view is adding additional imaginary information into the koan so it makes logical sense and Joshu acts in a logically consistent way. Youre not applying Zen Master logic Zen Master logic of course not necessarily being logical to the koan youre twisting the koan so that your everyday logic can grasp it.,zen,d9bi7b5,2,t5_2qhmf

9661882,0,t3_5ddm5i,My adviceDont ask for a definition in this forum before youve got familiar with the literature from some actual scholars.. Blue Cliff Record by the Cleary brothers.The preface will provide you a good introduction to the history of zen. Plus insights into the lineage of the masters.This book is actually a collection of koans. But my advice is Dont jump into cold water. Makes yourself familiar with the background first prefaces.. Zen Essence  by Thomas Cleary.Cleary provides quotes sayings from the masters referring to topics or questions like Zen Teaching? Basis of Zen? Summary of Zen Practice?.I think this approach is very helpful for people who want to get introduced to Zen in terms of What the hell is this shit about?  good guy Thomas Cleary!. Gateless Gate by Robert Aiken.This is rather a workbook for the practitioner than literature regarding zen.I havent read the book Ive linked to but in my opinion starting with the Mumonkan without any notes or comments from contemporary scholars students teachers translators is not the right approach.

9728874,0,t1_dac9g0u,I did retreats in Nelson in the Maiti Valley and many did retreats with Loori  not me  then I moved to South Korea and practiced there for  years.  Small world! In my experience zen masters are very grounded people and I respect their commitment and practice. Having said that many teachings I read appear to be delusional and probably misguided.  I let my practice guide me on who is able to cut through the shit. A delusional teacher can do more damage than good. I would consider us lucky to have met some good teachers. Loori was mountains and Rivers school from what I remember but I dont know the lineage.  The Diamond lineage originated in Japan and so they stuck ridgedly to the form ie forced sitting no movement allowed  people shouted at you if you moved. Unpleasant and not conducive to westerners practice.  I learned to prefer the Kwan Um school because like most inflexible people I experienced lots of pain during the retreat days and in this school intermittent standing to relax the legs was allowed. ,zen,dacaoo8,1,t5_2qhmf

The OP knew this and wasnt even wading into those waters because it wasnt the topic of his OP.The external characteristics of Zen are probably going to fall under the definition of religion as the OP pointed out and as wikipedia pointed out. Because Zen masters sit on pillows and talk about ultimate truths and wear robes and have texts etc. etc. etc. All external forms.Do Zen masters say things that reject the meaning of external forms? Yes they do! But you cant use what Zen masters say inside those external characteristics without bringing up the intensity they use to destroy all conceptual thought.

We look at form but we miss the knowing or awareness behind it. When you see the knowing behind forms you can see the knowing outlining the forms.

You can count its shakes along that set you previously defined starting from the identity of the operation under which your set is a group and symbolized by the circle  and you realize that many things occur at certain intervals of these shakesBecause it shakes so many times compared to most of what you notice you decide to name a certain number of shakes a silly word. You can come up with anything so you call it a minuteNow you wonder how you feelsee these shakes of your atom. You realize that if you and a buddy stand a certain way apart from each other and hide your crystals only to unhide them simultaneously you can actually count a certain number of shakes of YOUR atom before you even see him uncover HIS atom. Very mysterious. You decide that there must be some thing that does that. You name this another silly word and say that your buddy and you are different in such a way that you count your crystals shakes before seeing his crystals shakes. You call this difference location. You already have minute so you decide that you may as well name the difference in location that results in a minute number of shakes before you see his cesium atom shake something silly like  metersSo youve come up with some VERY silly words with your buddy. He introduces you to another friend of his. His friend is from some mountainous hilly place and used a different number of shakes than you when defining his measurement of the difference in location a mile but he happens to call the same number of shakes that you do a minute finally some civilized behavior!This is MANY more shakes than your  meters. You assume that they must have more time on their hands in this foreign landBut you count your shakes to his mile and have your friend count how many times your shakes add up to  meters and you realize how many shakes you need to count for his mileNow the two of them are friends because they worked out and shot guns together. They even swam! Your buddy says that they call themselves a silly name called MarinesHe says marines love seeing how many shakes go by as they try to change location! Its a fun thing! So these two guys ask you to count how many shakes of your cesium atom go by while they try to change their location to a difference of  miles. And thats another silly name they have in his land of hillsSo you count your shakes and when you see them have a location change of  miles you realize that you have counted  minutes while counting your shakes! WOW thats a lot of shakes! MIGHTY MIGHTY MARINESAnd then your friend named Albert comes in and fucks with it all even more but the marines cant understand what he is even saying so its okay  ,zen,db5mwd8,2,t5_2qhmf

10046671,0,t1_dbh2rcy,Actually no.Being able to speak in actuality is foundational.They are pointing at a specific tree they are pointing at a specific three pounds of flax. The difference is that that is not intellectualized and is not dualistic.Both the specific tree and the specific flax and the specific fist in all instances these are examples of when the absolute is relative. It fulfills both meanings absolute and relative because its not the opposite of anything.When Joshu says Mu its not the opposite of Yes. When Joshu says the oak tree in the garden its not the opposite of no oak tree in the garden. That there actually is an oak tree in the garden is one reason that its not the opposite of anything but likewise that he traveled  years studying with anyone who could teach him is another reason that its not the opposite of anything. An appropriate statement is not the opposite of an inappropriate statement.If it was the opposite an appropriate statement would be what the five ranks calls defective integration which is the same as the boy who holds up his finger and gets it cut off. When Juzhi holds up his finger the absolute is relative its not the opposite of anything. When the boy holds it up hes arriving there conceptually and is cheating essentially skipping the long road of mutual integration that leads to his own way of saying oak tree in the garden.,zen,dbh3v19,1,t5_2qhmf

10198480,0,t1_dbzutfh,Hm interesting i agree that zen doesnt have monopoly on enlightenment but ewk is pushing the highest vehicle of zen if only indirectly.     I think posts like this are fine even in the zen forum because banning you from posting this stuff would hinder you because you wouldnt come here anymore. When its clear someone doesnt wanna just aim at enlightenment I like to accommodate when I can. I imagine he does as well. I dont think I can help too effectively and I dont even suggest people to give up or leave. But ewk shows you the logical contradiction that comes along with focusing on what you focus on versus focusing on zen.    If you focus on zen itll probably be faster but if youre having fun its gonna be hard to drop the thing you like because you dont wanna drop it. So if youre not having a really bad time then its all good I think. Id call that a win.    Ewk isnt as liberal with failing people. He wants you enlightened. Mmm nah he wants enlightenment to happen implying people but not explicitly so that his work is independent of any possible value approximation as it stands on its own and anyone can see its value but he doesnt make sure you interpret it properly.

10542098,0,t1_dd317kq,I have looked at enough cases to recognize that alone  they are not sufficient to build a religion out of them.   Alone  they stand as a system of literature  or a cultural collection  that stands as an enigma to most people.    Without a layer of outsider commentary  most people are going to be stumped for a bit when exposed.   On the other hand  something else can also happen with these stories   and a lot of people have been attracted to them for that.I am also suggesting that some people have been forced to deal with the  zen cases in order to defend an inconvenient lineage.    It would have been more convenient if Zongmis lineage could have been used by Dogen  for example.I dont think its necessary to claim to be right about why clouds cant be pinned to the sky.    Some people will relate to it.   But those who continue to try to set down principles and truths  those who are still serious about getting ordained after looking into these stories   are also going to show something for all to see.    What else would we have to point at if we stopped the show?   When we are not pushing lessons and principles   the people who are  tend to stand out.    Outstanding.   If one is going to insist they are right  whats the difference.   So  we learn how to point  by example of the cases.   That takes it off of me  and puts it in a particular direction.   A way.

10555003,0,t1_dd3rme0,I think King is a lot less selfindulging than Dreyfus in her interpretation of Heidegger for what its worth. Not sure about Haugeland. I tend to suggest that people start with more conservative readings of a philosopher and then look into more experimental and often intriguing takes on things. In fact I generally wouldnt recommend Heidggers takes on any western philosopher until someone is at least moderately familiar with a thinker and of course ready to read Heidegger. But they are fascinating and important its just that its usually the rule not the exception that people warp or project onto philosophers ideas in my experience and the greatest philosophers themselves are among the most guilty of this. Zen does it shamelessly and I dont mean that negatively either  it does much to further the tradition but it is important to be able to talk about x thinker in their own right as well especially if we are to take them in another direction and bring them forward.Heideggers notion of a schema is different but parallel. It can crudely be put that category is passive and existential what I meant there by Heideggers schema is active. Category means a wide variety of things in the history of philosophy but it generally indicates the most general characteristics of being  categories of relation quantity quality etc. Socalled ontological predicates because they are the categories of relations that can be predicated of things. Aristotle amp Kant are the two to consult here aside from Heidegger  note for instance that the former includes time amp space whereas the latter does not. However while categories are the a priori characters of the Being of things existentials are the a priori characters of the Being of Dasein. Again its all about the fact that hes operating within a stperson ontology not a rd as most Western thinkers do and I think we are in general inclined to. On this point it was demonstrated in the year before Heideggers death that a rdperson ontology can indeed be derived out of a stperson ontology and furthermore that therefore the stperson ontology was more fundamental an important point in Heidegger and Aristotles shared quest for ground. But that is more technical in nature... Strictly speaking beings as explained where the other  is.As far as this goesgt Dasein is inclined to fall back upon its world the world which it is and to interpret itself in terms of that world by its reflected light and that Dasein simultaneously falls prey to the tradition of which it has more or less explicitly taken hold.Heidegger goes to great lengths to try to clear this up throughout BampT but Ill briefly say that our being is social beingwithothers. Moreover our being is concernful see care we are touched by the world amp its goings on it moves us it speaks to us it affects our very being. So when we ask ourselves what we are what we ought to do what the significance of life is and so on we do not just encounter these questions in a vacuum. They appear on the stage of life within a whole life as part of a life. Moreover they appear as part of history. That is to say in Heideggers terminology we are thrown into the world and our existence precognitively comports itself with preontological understanding towards the world. In this comportment in our modes of being in our everyday lives we live in the world with others and our own mode of being is affected by our existing in the world in such a manner. Heidegger has more to say about world however which complicatesilluminates how one could be thrown into it. Is it is as if one sets it up before oneself and jumps in?Ill leave the talk of the tradition to Heidegger himself since it would require getting into a good level of detail but you can get an idea of the tricky business going on with how we comport ourselves towards anything let alone our comportment itself as examining the history of philosophy will amount to in this context.So therefore the answer to the Question of Being being itself to put it inexactly a mode of being  as answering the Question of Being requires us to comport ourselves towards Being to tackle our ownmost Being headon amp stare death in the face is affected by the way our world is. The answer is part of a spirallike hermeneuticohistorical process of us struggling to encounter our own existence as an object in the world. But our Being is not just beinginaworldfullofthings or a thingamongthings but beingintheworldconcernfullywithothers.Authenticity hasnt really yet come into the picture except inasmuch as our struggle for significant existence is also caught up in this reflective hermeneutic spiral amp inasmuch as our answering the Question of Being requires our authentic comportment towards Being living wholly as Zen frequently speaks of. Reflection inside of reflection inside of reflection upon Indras Net.There are a few Heidegger dictionaries that you may be able to find at a universities library or on academic filesharing websites that you should consult when confused about a term even  especially  when theyre confused about it too. Trust me youll need one. The way Heidegger uses the German language very Dogen amp Aristotlelike is TOO IMPORTANT to ignore. Sadly its also the source of a lot of straw men like uzaddars oftrepeated misconstrual I wont get into it here since enough ink has been spilled on it already.Thanks for talking about Heidegger! This is just the groundwork but I think the nitty gritty is a lot closer to Zen than people give him credit for!

First Critical Buddhists argue that a reading of the sutras with the Lotus sutra as the core sutra does not allow for the Zen teaching that all sentient and insentient beings are Buddhas..  Second that claiming to be a Buddhist doesnt make one a Buddhist instead Buddhism is defined by a specific catechism.  More here  The debate in the West involves several simultaneous questions.  To what degree is Japanese Buddhism in general and Soto Buddhism in particular related to Zen?   .  What does it mean to be Buddhist and what do Buddhists believe?.  More generally and abstractly what is the aim of religious studies?  Is it merely social anthropology in which descriptions of beliefs and practices are described?  Or is there a necessary element of criteria as a part of religious scholarship?rZen has been very divided about these questions for years rather acrimoniously at times.I created these wiki pages to give the debate some kind of basis outside of the claims of a certain segment of the forum that their faith was the true faith... a claim that isnt really the basis for discussion.Heres what Ive got on Buddhism so far The reason why debates about what Buddhism is seem to preoccupy rZen a forum about Zen is that there are people in the forum claiming to be Zen Buddhists who repeatedly put forward Zen Buddhist teachings that are at odds with Zen   These at odds with Zen teachings include lots of Dogen and lots of varieties of Evangelical New Age Western Buddhism which is sort of Dogenlite most of the time and includes people like Shunryu Suzuki and Thich Hahn.The debate is further muddied by the fact that Shunryu and Hahn and their followers seem to go out of their way to avoid talking about basic Buddhist doctrines and how their religious views may or may not comport with sutras or Zen lineage texts.,zen,ddx5zv7,4,t5_2qhmf

11394555,0,t1_dfncwjb,gtThe Four Noble Truths are completely faith based This is stupidity to state.The truths are dukkha the arising of dukkha the cessation of dukkha and the path leading to the cessation of dukkha.Dukkha  The ancient Aryans who brought the Sanskrit language to India were a nomadic horse and cattlebreeding people who travelled in horse or oxdrawn vehicles. Su and dus are prefixes indicating good or bad. The word kha in later Sanskrit meaning sky ether or space was originally the word for hole particularly an axle hole of one of the Aryans vehicles. Thus sukha  meant originally having a good axle hole while duhkha meant having a poor axle hole leading to discomfortDukkha is suffering and it is a fact of life based on what? The fact that were in a body  that we have physical form. However we still must live so we must move beyond the first noble truth. The first noble truth is called what? Rupa. What is Rupa? Its physical form the phenomenal world. The four elements. Those are called Rupajhanas meditation on form  Being confined to form Crowley wrote in Book  EXISTENCE as we know it is full of sorrow. To mention only one minor point every man is a condemned criminal only he does not know the date of his execution....The three realms Sanskrit triloka or tridhtu of desire form and formlessness and the meditations of form within the realm of form are related to the Buddhist view of the three poisons of the mind i.e. greed lust desire etc. aversion hatred anger etc. and ignorance delusion illusion etc..There we have greed desire which is the antithesis of nirvana and finding. Bodhidharma says in order to practice Zen one must get rid of passions and not to aspire to anything.Lets look at what you grabbed from the article which wasgt SORROWS CAUSE.The cause of sorrow is desire. I take desire here to include such a phenomenon as the tendency of two molecules of hydrogen and chlorine to combine under certain conditions. If death be painful to me it is presumably so to a molecule  if we represent one operation as pleasant the converse is presumably painful. Though I am not conscious of the individual pain of the countless deaths involved in this my act of writin it may be there.Desiring is not being content with what IS. Its seeking something feeling as though one is missing something feeling that one will be made complete with the union of another something thats awareness of the duality. Being nondual or in yoga is union with god or being one with the Tao its not feeling this isolation and separation its selfactualization instead.In Qabalah thats being in Unity which is using the Supernal Triangle body mind and spirit which is intuitivebased and nondual. With regards to the molecule metaphor these words from Crowley highlight what hes referring togt...to break off all relations with the Supernal Triad and to replace it by inventing a false crown Dath. To them Knowledge will be everything and what is Knowledge but the very soul of Illusion?gtRefusing thus the true nourishment of all his faculties they lose their structural unity and must be fortified by continuous doses of dope in anguished selfpreservation. Thus all its chemical equations become endothermic. gt...To describe the alternative attitude should clarify by dint of contrast at least the contemplation should be a pleasant change.gtEvery accretion must modify me. I want it to do so. I want to assimilate it absolutely. I want to make it a permanent feature of my Temple.  I am not afraid of losing myself to it if only because it also is modified by myself in the act of union. I am not afraid of its being the wrong thing...Fear is what causes our dukkha and fear of dying or losing ourselves to experiences or being changed by experiences is what prevents us from giving ourselves to the true dharma. So thats completely in line with what was being said above. You also left off the completion of that thought which wasgtAnd what I call fatigue may be the echo  in  my  central  consciousness  of  the shriek  of  a  peripheral  anguish.   Here  we leave  the  domain  of  fact  but  at  least  as  far our knowledge extends all or nearly all the operations  of  Nature  are  vanity  and  vexation of spirit.Do you ever sit down with a pen and begin to write but find a few words on the paper and find yourself unable to compel yourself the vanity of expression? Without strong drive to communicate a message writing is but vanity and as he wrote were distracted from the task by our unconscious awareness of our anguish. Crowley wrote Though I am not conscious of the individual pain of the countless deaths involved in the act of his writing the anguish to stop is the death of the specific expression of spirit that sought to create to begin with like a mad impulse. The loss of interest or loss of ability to convey when writing sticking to this example is that the words werent originating from Buddha Mind they werent from the  Vajras they werent an expression of enlightened mind of Buddha Nature. Cant have the  poisons and have the  vajras at the same time. gtHowever back to Crowley if you want to believe the physics of two atoms involves feelings of pain and desire then you are as delusional as he was. He wasnt talking about that. The article linked was written in  in  hed pen the Book of the Law wherein he wrotegtFor I am divided for loves sake for the chance of union. gtThis is the creation of the world that the pain of division is as nothing and the joy of dissolution all.The Four Noble Truths are fact and you cant recognize Zen without them. Hence all the Zen Masters referring to the Four Elements or the Four Wisdoms which are on top of those four elements as shown with the Five Dhyani Buddhas. But to go back to the point The truths are dukkha the arising of dukkha the cessation of dukkha and the path leading to the cessation of dukkha. We have a body the four elements four forces will be constantly in motion and interacting through this life as we break down and fall apart in time. This whole process is suffering and painful and our mortality is taught to Buddhists through the Pure Land teachings where young and strong live in accompaniment with the frail and old and act as one.  The Three Poisons lead to discontent and suffering in our form and lead to mental anguish etc.  The cessation of Dukkha we can try to make the body and mind strong physical exercise mental discipline studying the noble way being immersed in our tasks which is Wu Wei. The path leading to the cessation of Dukkha is then moving with the fold path the dharma wheel and turning with it not being adharmic and creating suffering or indulging in greed and malice as to create samsara rebirth into suffering. To ultimately free ourselves and others from suffering we walk the compassionate path of the Bodhisattva and Zen is acting with enlightenment on the fourth truth  taking The Way the path which is Sukha  the wheel turning smoothly and without friction.gtZen teacher Muan Fazhong  at first studied the Tiantai Buddhist philosophy. Later he became intent on the Zen school and visited Longmen Yan.gtEven when he was busy he never forgot to keep his attention on his meditation. Once as he was working the treadmill on the water wheel he happened to look at the temple signboard which said The wheel of the Dharma is always turning. Suddenly he was greatly enlightened. Look at the Five Dhyani Buddhas holding the  elements and four wisdoms in the center is Vairocana which represents Buddha and our body but also the space element or emptiness and notice he also represents the wheel and the teaching of the dharma. The ego is a creation of the division and suffering Nirvana is an extinguishing of it.gtA core teaching of ChanZen Buddhism describes the transformation of the Eight Consciousnesses into the Four Wisdoms. In this teaching Buddhist practice is to turn the light of awareness around from misconceptions regarding the nature of reality as being external to kensh directly see ones own nature. Thus the Eighth Consciousness is transformed into the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom the Seventh Consciousness into the Equality Universal Nature Wisdom the Sixth Consciousness into the Profound Observing Wisdom and First to Fifth Consciousnesses into the All Performing Perfection of Action Wisdom.Perfection of action is the fourth noble truth the path leading to the cessation of suffering  its building the world for ourselves and others in accordance with the dharma not neglecting life and the pains of life...You know... enlightened being?,zen,dfnk2cd,1,t5_2qhmf

11421470,0,t1_dfql5gf,I dont know why it did. Luckily I copied itI talk about the belial principle in depth towards the very end This is really interesting stuff especially how it relates to zen wisdom in the world and what we are really doing when we acknowledge a freemasonic luciferean Alan wattsI saw someone make a post about burning scriptures to acknowledge that we are Christs Just Like IaHushua quoting Alan watts agenda in the modern world.  The belial principle is like daoism claiming to be leaving yourself open to the void but arrogantly sticking to a philosophy that whatever is accessible to you must be the limit of life claiming godhood or realization of the self to being the actualisation of our destiny which is to become like godsThis luciferean philosophy is seen in all cultures and civilizations down to the ancient pagans.  Gnostics Hindus freemasonry and the new age today.Shiva is the leviathan chaos claimed to be what we all come from making the time space matrix we live in being a false duality light trap we need to escape out of.  Its a rebellious philosophy inherently.  It refuses to acknowledge a soveriegn force or moral compass unless it promises a  pragmatic checks and balances returnAll the religions claiming to worship the true Elohim CatholicismIslam are just relegions Proselytizing sin and driving us all to rebellion.The game of life is to test our propensity to respond to his call as a real guiding force that knows everything about you. It is NOT a checks and balances system THAT IS WHY THE TRUTH OF ZEN BEING THAT THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO SAVE YOURSELF IS SO IMPORTANTAND ITS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT YOU DONT LET THAT REALIZATIOB CONVINCE YOU TO WORSHIP YOURSELF AS AN IDOL OF SHIVA OR BAAL shivataman kunalini enlightened person the earth is concave and YHWH IS in the center btw this truth is actually kind of intense sorry for just dropping it right hereHERE ARE THE  CARNAL PURSUITS AND WISDOMSPRINCIPLES OF MAN TAKIN RIGHT OUT OF THE FREEMASON HANDBOOKEveryone who has fallen for any kind of new age hypnosis to basically worship eastern paganism NEEDS to consider thisThe Satan PrincipleSatans number is six six being the number of the beast representing mans carnal nature being set free. Releasing the wolf within if you want to call it so. Sin no longer exists nothing is sinful but to deny yourself of pleasure in your Utopia.Satans color is red red being the color of emotion Satan being the guardian of lust anger happiness sadness etcbeing released.Satans element is fire fire being an appropriate representation of emotional outburst or ritual. Destruction and lust are the two prime elements of fire and Satan.Satans direction is south south representing the dissension from Godhood to the ascension to Godhood. Creation of ones Utopia.Satans human element is anger lust and primal emotion representing the release of emotion through sex or anger and crushing of ones enemies.Satans altar element are the candles Candles representing holding the flame of Satan or emotion primal man.Satans planetary aspect is Mars Mars being the planet that represents justice. Due to the biblical story of Satan punishing the sinners Satan was at times called the Avenging Angel or Angel of Justice.Satans highest manifestation is through womans full release of the carnal will self explanatory.The Lucifer PrincipleLucifers number is nine nine being the number of pride as any number nine is multiplied into returns to itself. Example    Lucifer also being known as the Angel of pride. This represents being proud of all things we do!Lucifers color is blue blue being the color of the sky and water representing that Lucifer is all around and within us. That Lucifer is the prime elementenergy that motivates and cultivates our world. Other colors Lucifer is associated with are white and silver so accordingly altar pentagrams must be surrounded by blue with a silverwhite pentagram with a black border.Lucifers element is air air being that which allows us to speak his words of truth as his manifestation on Earth.Lucifers direction is the east east being where a lot of the sacred wisdom and the great wars will come from. It was once stated to me by a Germanic Luciferian that a wise Magickian from Persia an Arab will come and bring with him the aeon of Lucifer or in laymans terms the Antichrist.Lucifers human element is wisdom or applied knowledge with time study and practice it is believed that man can attain the Lucifer state this only through applied knowledge or wisdom.Lucifers altar element is incense incense being a representation of air known to Luciferians as sweet air.Lucifers planetary element is Venus Lucifer being known as the morning star or first star of morning otherwise known as Venus. Venus known as the Planet of love represents the beauty of Lux Ferre Latin for light bearerbringer or Lucifer.Lucifers consortFemale aspect is Lilith Lilith being the first wife of Adam before becoming the queen of the damned. It is said Lilith comes from the mud and the dust and is queen of the SuccubiLuciferic Witch. When Lucifer and Lilith mate they equal the androgynous being known as Baphomet or the Goat of Mendes also called God of the Witches. Liliths number is two also known as the number of the eternal female. Lilith is considered an equal to Lucifer to some and the feminine aspect of Lucifer himself to others.Lucifers highest manifestation is through understanding of oneself this being the goal of the MagickianLuciferian to begin with being as Lucifer himself total awakening of the human godform Lucifer. Without knowing the self one cannot hope to achieve any real understanding of anything else. Applied knowledge in action is a prime example of Lucifers manifestation!The Leviathan PrincipleLeviathans number is three three being the number of Chaos as three can go into six and nine but doesnt have the stability of the number one.Leviathans color is blue blue being the color of the wild oceans untamed womans carnal side overcoming himher chaos.Leviathans element is water water being that which our human forms are primarily created of. This represent the unity of matter and antimatter chaos and order yin with yang.Leviathans direction is west west being used to represent chaos and disorder.Leviathans human element is chaos chaos meaning manifestation of order from the chaos of the nothing. No longer controlling ones actions words etc and not remembering fragments of time due to anger or lust are prime examples of this principal.Leviathans altar element is water used in the chalice as a sacrament to or as Leviathan.Leviathans planet is man or microcosm representing the bond between man and his own lost natural self.Leviathans highest manifestation comes from man realizing his own deification Just as God can create and destroy so can we. Just as water is unpredictable and can be calm one moment and crashing another so are we. Thats the gift offrom Leviathan!The Belial PrincipleBelials number is one one being the number that represents earth and remaining firmto ones convictions. Bullheadedness in a good way!Belials color is black black being the color of the primordial chaos before the Earth. Most Luciferic sigils have black in them in some form representing the Earth.Belials element is Earth Earth being the element that sustains humanity. The carnal laws of man are dictated by the laws of the Earth.Belials direction is north north being the representation of constantly striving forward and upward changing and recreating our Utopia bigger and better.Belials human element is remaining firm to ones own beliefs not dancing around in pools of religious feces. Finding a philosophy which is your own and sticking to it.Belials altar element is the incense coal representing Earth and Womankind holding the flame of Lucifer.Belials planet is Earth previously explained.Belials highest manifestation is through understanding and living the natural laws of our carnal self self explanatory.,zen,dfqm1m6,1,t5_2qhmf

You assumed he either moralizes or displays antagonism towards Zen. Neither of these apparently naive assumptions hold. So you resort to some broad name calling and shut yourself out of the discussion.Perhaps you are the one who is unfamiliar with modern Theravada teachers such as Mr Goldstein?  It would certainly appear so from your incorrect assumptions.For all you know Mr Goldstein could be a hardcore Zen master out to trap lost souls like myself by adorning his teachings in the attire of Theravada. He could be as Zen as Bodhidharma himself. Yet you assume hes not that hes antagonistic towards Zen that he promotes religion a cult even and a morality.Why is that?

You insist that there is a moral authority... but you are ashamed to admit what you think it is....

If youre all on your own so to speak its very easy to go very wrong and still think youre doing really well because you have no one to correct you.Developing the eye is a great idea. You can go to a local Zen school but thats no different to anywhere else more often than not.
