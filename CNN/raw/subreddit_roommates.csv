1696149,0,t3_25zvo7,Nothing really dramatic but the worst was a roommate who... never ever paid rent on time even though he made a ton of money and came from a somewhat wealthy family. I learned that the only way for me to get the rent money was to command him to write me the check literally on the spot and to stand over his shoulder until the check was in my hand. To make him ensure hed transferred enough cash to his checking account Id have to tell him I was going to literally cash the check immediately after he gave it to me and I did since my bank was just a block from the apartment. was extremely territorial over the TV. He watched TV about  times as much as I did but somehow felt that situation was fair and would get passive aggressive if I wanted to play a game or something. Nevermind the fact that I owned everything in the living room from the TV to the couch to the game consoles. watched TV super late into the night even on workdays and very loudly. It took months of me telling him to turn down the fucking volume before he learned to be considerate without being told to like a toddler. always tried to weasel his way out of paying for shared things. For instance we shared groceries and went grocery shopping together. This fucker didnt like the obvious solution of splitting each grocery bill in half which would have you know made sense and avoided problems. Instead he wanted to take turns  like I pay for everything on one trip then he pays for everything on the next trip etc. Nevermind the problem of making sure the trips cost relatively equal amounts. I remember once it was his turn and we were at the store. He told me to go get in line while he would quickly grab a little tub of ice cream. He knew exactly where the ice cream was he knew exactly which tub he wanted wed looked at it just  minutes earlier and it was right next to the cash registers. He took like  minutes to come back. He had hoped that in that time Id have already paid for everything. Nope  I waited the entire time for him to show up so he still had to pay. After that I forced us to split every grocery bill evenly. He threw a fit at first but agreed eventually. couldnt throw trash away properly. Seriously he would put trash in the trash can but outside the trash bag. It wasnt a oneoff incident. He consistently failed to get trash inside the trash bag successfully. One of the laziest fucking things Ive ever seen from somebody who was actually fairly accomplished in life.,roommates,cjsyoco,2,t5_2r1s7
