The user gets a chance to decide if they want to let you access their reddit data. If they allow it your client will get a onetime use access code. You then take that code your client ID and your client secret and use them to get an access token.Once you have an access token  regardless of which method you got it  you make requests to the reddit API and send that access token. It acts like a session cookie in that the reddit servers use it to figure out which client is making the request and which redditor if any to act as.,redditdev,cuy6nos,2,t5_2qizd

10437513,0,t3_5p84ek,Hey there Im the original author of this script.Let me start with its old outdated and replaced with reddits features.Its a blast from the past seeing this thing still being used but when I get some time I can update it to use OAuth instead of the API based login which is now deprecated.The single file is PHP HTML CSS and some small Javascript allowing users to select a flair and the bot to assign it to them on the specified subreddit. It was created for rHeroesofNewerth when the flair system first came out. Allowing users to select their favorite heroes flair as an Avatar. Also a lot of this functionality is now built into reddit itself so this script isnt exactly needed if youre using static data.See How weve done the same thing on rDotA See Also my original post announcing the bot ,redditdev,dcr5xqz,4,t5_2qizd

10779899,0,t1_ddruvjj,Yeah the numcomments will usually be off in that regard.  My API will give the ids that it saw while walking the comment stream realtime.  There are some automod actions that occur where a comment will get removed before it even hits the stream.  Generally speaking though all of visible comments in a thread should always be reflected as well by the ids from my endpoint.,redditdev,ddrv9n9,2,t5_2qizd
10801075,0,t3_5uh6pz,There are  different streams one for comments one for submissions. You would have to use threading to have both streams going at the same time then feed that data into some process such as a queue and then a function that processes the queue.,redditdev,ddu1yu3,1,t5_2qizd

11215628,0,t3_603r5u,You need to set up an installed app versus scriptweb. The user will initially be asked if theyll allow the app access to their account using whichever scopes you requested. Its then up to you to retrieve the token and store it for future API requests.,redditdev,df3a0i9,3,t5_2qizd

11646921,0,t1_dgg6g46,Keep in mind that if youre storing the actual Comment objects the properties are not going to update themselves. When you finally write them to the file youll be using h old info unless you go through the equally grindy process of refreshing them. Unless of course you only want the unchangeable properties like ID and timestamp anyway.,redditdev,dgg6xod,2,t5_2qizd
11661366,0,t1_dgfp3pj,Yes they are incremental.  On the other hand you cant get a user by ID only an id by username so its not easy to use that way.,redditdev,dghtwxj,1,t5_2qizd
