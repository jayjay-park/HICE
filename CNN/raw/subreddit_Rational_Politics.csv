8841830,0,t3_4zvgmn,My value system is composed of a mix of utilitarianism and egotism. I value myself and those I are about above all other human beings. However I also place a high value on all other human beings. Next comes nonhuman sentient beings. Next comes future humans and next future nonhuman sentient beings. I generally perceive that society suffers from big coordination problems and that is the biggest concern in politics for me. I see government as the leastofallevils solution to big coordination problems pending greater rationality education and in the long term singularity. So my default is to push for sciencebased policy solutions that address coordination problems in the short term focus on expanding rationality education and hope for friendly AGI. ,Rational_Politics,d7anv0i,2,t5_3fjkc
