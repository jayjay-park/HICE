I think they are Chalcedony but Im not positive. From what I have looked up so far the outcropping seems like it is igneous rock but no expert. Also I found these near Baumholder Germany.,whatsthisrock,cgjt6b2,2,t5_2w6k5

Life has been stinking up the planet with various oozes for over  billion years PAnyway I did some looking around online and I think I found some resources to help youThere are plenty of great videos on there and the metamorphic one in particular I think will answer your questions on those rocks.As for granite from syenite I think thatd beyond the scope of the channel but in the igneous episode they discuss how silica  determines a rock and syenite is a rock thats at granite levels of silica but with little to no quartz. Often times this results in foidbearing rocks. Foid means feldspathoid and those are minerals that are trying to be feldspar or quartz but there just isnt quite enough silica to overpower the aluminum and the ratio is off so they make minerals like leucite and nepheline. When naming these rocks we do not say foid  we name the foid itself eg. nepheline syenite or  if the foid is REALLY prevalent nephelinte.

Yes I know  I was questioning what type of rock that fossils would normally be found in.I found this rock in a giant cut through a mountain ridge in the historic mining areas of southwest Montana. Dont know much about it just curious as to the type of rock surrounding the fossil shells.EDIT My Geologic Units of Montana tells me its on a border between PreBelt Gneiss and Undifferentiated Cambrian which means little to me.

Nephrite is a fibrous aggregate variety of tremoliteactinolite a basic calcium magnesium iron silicate and jadeite is a pyroxene.  Mainly you find nephrite on the coast of California into BC.  Sometimes jadeite is found but its not common. The piece you posted is not either probably a quartzite you can see the boundaries between crystals,whatsthisrock,dcdoded,2,t5_2w6k5
