8320504,0,t1_d5hhmzz,I agree.  I gave gold to the most satisfying answer  but I rephrased the question at the last minute just as an academic exercise not due to anxiety or real worries.  I think that the POS hacks were mostly because nobody considered them a threat  they were behind the firewall so to speak.  But wow  turns out some major stuff was hacked because the hackers viewed a bigger picture.  So no sleep loss or anything but are there reasons to hack my cable box?  Im thinking that as soon as the first vulnerability is found WHAMMO  millions of boxes could be infectedexploited because nobody is worrying.  Can anyone think of a reason other than ego to hack a cable box  would they get anything?Im no longer worried now Im just curious.,NetworkSecurity,d5hmaqh,1,t5_2svej
