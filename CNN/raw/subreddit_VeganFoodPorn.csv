3740780,0,t3_3395zh,Pretty simple. Cook sun dried tomatoes in pan with their own oil until somewhat blackened and add mushrooms and cook together for a while basically until theres lots of good sticky bits on the pan. Deglaze with white wine. Then add vegan cashew Alfredo like the one from Oh She Glows and cook together for a bit.,VeganFoodPorn,cqio981,3,t5_2s6ud

7391535,0,t3_4ggrsq,Im a white guy who is with a Mexican girl and living in Mexico right now. I ate lots of Mexican food before going vegan and Ive discovered the BEST fake meat for tacos.Soy curls. Theyre amazing. Very similar to the real thing and I lived on tacos daily for years. Soak the soy curls in No Chicken Broth by the way if you havent used this before get it. Before adding the soy curls add cumin Mexican oregano some kind of chile powder New Mexican chile powder is good or chipotle chiles. Mix it all up add the soy curls. Soak for  minutes. Then pan sear them in some oil.By the looks of it these tacos you got were made with soy curls.,VeganFoodPorn,d2id8pk,2,t5_2s6ud
