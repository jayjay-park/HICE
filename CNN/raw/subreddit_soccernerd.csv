2041139,0,t3_2i6i0l,Interview continued... part Personally I think that this is one of the areas that analytics will struggle with if or when football properly embraces the use of data.  All the use of proper analytics will do is slightly increase the chances of a team winning a game or making a winning play maybe by the order of just  or .  This means that to the naked eye it might look like analytics is actually having very little impact.  Or worse than that if someone is ballsy enough to run a play that they feel is correct based on some analytical reasoning and it fails they will inevitably take a lot of stick as they have stuck their head above the parapet and visibly failed.  An example of this is in American football where teams generally tend to punt on th downs.  They do this even though it has statistically been shown not to be the highest EV play however there seems to be comfort in numbers.  I guess no one will be sacked for punting on th down whereas it is much more noticeable if they choose another play on th down and it goes wrong.In the real world each football match is played just once.  In this sample of one any result or outcome is possible each one to a varying probability and it is very difficult for the human brain to look beyond the actual results that were achieved.  This concept of being judged by the outcome and not the process is difficult if you are trying to challenge the status quo.  In the short term you can never actually prove whether you are right or wrong.Are there any people working in your field that you look toward who are leading the way? Do you take much notice of tactical journalists like Michael Cox Jonathan Wilson etc. for your work?There are quite a few other guys in the public sphere that are leading the analytical charge and many of them are doing great work.  But while I read everything they produce I tend not to lean on them for my own ideas.  There is simply a huge amount of areas and concepts to research in football and the best solution is when we are all researching and analysing different facets of the game.I would certainly read everything Michael Cox writes but we analyse the sport differently.  He knows much more about football than I do and he certainly watches much more football than me.   I do take note of what he sees in a game and I sometimes think how that could be represented  quantified through the use of data.  The rise of the prominence and fashion of the High Press as a tactic is an example of this.  The tactical guys have been writing about it and I then developed the PPDA metric to be able to objectively measure it. Without knowing the tactical guys personally this demonstrates how I imagine our brains work differently.  They are able to visually pick up on something and describe it meanwhile I want to be able to hang a number on it so it can be compared against and evaluated.  I find myself wondering how does a performance of Team y compares against Team xs or how does the Premier League compare to La Liga in certain aspects?  Theres room in this football world for all of us.Thanks to Colin for taking the time to answer these questions. Colin can be followed on Twitter colinttrainor He added that if there are any budding analystsjournalists out there who are interested in contributing articles to Statsbomb purely for the love of the game and a bit of exposure then they should get in touch with the website. Finally anyone who has a question for Colin can post it in the comments section below. Hes agreed to pop in to this thread and answer it at some point. ,soccernerd,ckz9v6w,8,t5_339of

3576237,0,t3_316mjy,Excellent work. I read the book a while back but I found it rather unwieldy and I am not the encyclopedia of knowledge I hoped I would become after reading!So much to take in. The amount of detail was excellent but I felt the larger points that were being made or should have been drawn from it often passed me by.Im just beginning to read what youve put together from the start. Enjoying it very much.Small suggestion. No big deal really but you could end each chapter like this below and add a link to it when you post the next chapter. Yes nitpicking is a hobby of mine. I know they can be found through search but as I said no big deal really. ltltlt Chapter  | Chapter  | Chapter  gtgtgt ,soccernerd,cpzx2lt,1,t5_339of

7716441,0,t3_4kve8b,He doesnt have stats about Liverpool but they are readily available. Did he purposely leave them out because Liverpool is one of the worst teams in the PL at defending corners? ,soccernerd,d3jb1mr,1,t5_339of
