292489,0,t3_1wrl3c,I think ads are so persuasive because they show people what is the in thing. People look at ads and say oh I want to be like that or do that. For example womens hair product ads are very persuasive to many women. They hear that their hair could look silky and soft and they want that. They are drawing the people into their product. In regards to the sexualized images of women I think the harm is that many of the women who are in ads such as Victorias Secret and ads of such are beautiful thin model like. It makes women want to be like thatI believe I am not a women so I am just making inferences. I also think that sometimes men are also affect by this. Most men that are in commercials are in shape muscular guys and that is an image that todays modern man wants. The ads show the people with no flaws no problems. The beautiful in shape people. For some people it makes them aspire to be that for others it causes almost an obsession to look like that man or woman and that I think is where it becomes harmful. ,MrM106Spring2014,cfb2xsi,4,t5_2yxuq
385072,0,t3_1y3876,Kimmel writes that men are pressured to never show emotion because thats not manly. Boys and men are constantly told not to cry and to take it like a man which essentially means being void of emotion. He goes on to say As a result boys feel effeminate not only if they express their emotions but even if they feel them. This pressure on men to not have sadness is hurtful because sadness and pain are parts of life and the healthy thing to do is to express them maybe not everywhere but it should be expressed somewhere. Men are people too so they WILL feel sadness at some point. This pressure causes men to feel isolated in their pain making it all the worse.,MrM106Spring2014,cfkof7m,2,t5_2yxuq
386529,0,t3_1y3876,Kimmel made the argument about the three cultures of guyland. Particularly he mentioned the culture of silence and gave examples of how the culture of silence worked in various cases. I will like to challenge his point. If the author claims that violence is a way to proof masculinity why should the boys be afraid of the bullies? Why not fight the bullies proof your masculinity? Make them pay make them lose. The author mentioned that the first rule of Guy code is express no doubts no fear no vulnerabilities. Does this mean that all guys except the bullies are not guys? I would like to use my free pass please grade this response but dont count it,MrM106Spring2014,cfktvid,1,t5_2yxuq
