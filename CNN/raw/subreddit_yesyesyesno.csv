2380125,0,t1_cm5ub7y,According to a QI episode there is a unsweet spot where cats have a much higher risk of getting injured. In short apparently below a certain level fine because its not high enough to do damage and above a certain level they do a certain flying squrrel type thing to slow their decent reports even of surviving falls from aeroplanes. But in between those levels they are high enough for damage but dont have enough time to rotate their body properly to slow their decent.,yesyesyesno,cm5w3zg,7,t5_2z97c

6942362,0,t1_d12mtfe,It is a little more dramatic here.Allen with  who is a hero of this episode made his last mistake in the match. It is visible that he has  wins while Cao has  wins in the match consisting from  frames.Therefore Cao is awarded  points for the black ball foul and score reaches . After this Cao should have set white ball and put black ball into the pocket giving him victory at . But after looking up statistics from the match  final score for this frame was still  so I assume Allen simply gave up at this moment. Foul costs the same as a price of the most expensive ball from ones on which foul was performed or  points depending from which number is higher.,yesyesyesno,d138vh1,1,t5_2z97c
