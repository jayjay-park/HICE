9732580,0,t1_da3cdwb,I agree! They made it a big deal last year when Anthony won because they judged on overall tattoos and not just the final tats. So you would think they would stay true to the worse tattoo goes home. Nikki is very good however her portrait was awful. Looked like a little boy with drag makeup on.
