742297,0,t3_22nw9b,So as it stands right now there are large print and braille textbooksnovels available to borrow from the state. They did not include these funds in the new budget which means we will no longer be able to access these books. Because of this each district will have to provide the funds for these quite expensive textbooks. This will not only effect the quality of production of books but will effect the district and state as a whole.I provided a google doc of a letter you can just copy and paste! Super easy!You just have to find your local reps   and send them a quick email. It took me less than  minutes!Thanks in advanced! Were really hoping we can be heard so they can readdress this issue!,specialeducation,cgonkdr,1,t5_2tkk6
8316058,0,t3_4tapfo,Show an open mind.I entered the spec. ed world coming from teaching several years in the general ed world. The interview itself was probably easy for me because I had the jargon down. But when it came to specifics of spec ed  I was honest in telling her I had no experience but would be going through the intern program for my spec ed addon and that I was confident in my abilities to collaborate with colleagues and ask the tough questions to ensure I could be the best in my role. She asked me about my experience with the software we use to manage IEPs and again I was honest and said I didnt know how it worked but was confident in the training Id receive and would absorb as much as I could.Also what kind of setting are you teaching? Im only teaching part time this year but I have a few special day math classes. I told her and Ive proved it to her when shes observed me that I wouldnt treat my kids with special needs any differently than I would a group of gen ed kids. I push my kids to the same standards I am fair but firm with them I joke with them I challenge them day in and day out. I push them to use academic vocabulary and speak in complete sentences. The only difference is I go at a slower pace.Kids with special needs have many things against them. If I could do anything to ensure they are comfortable in my class and see it as a safe zone then I will do what it takes for that to happen.,specialeducation,d5h2awg,2,t5_2tkk6
