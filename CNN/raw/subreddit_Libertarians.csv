1643582,0,t3_2d5oi5,Since this thread was started in rAnarchoCapitalism I feel like almost all of us right now are ancaps. Which isnt a bad thing but I struggle to see how this subreddit is different from rAnarchoCapitalism. Except that right now its really awesome cause its basically the links we all think every libertarian should see which have already been posted to rAnarchoCapitalism and we might have missed them. ,Libertarians,cjmc5ze,4,t5_32zaf

8729648,0,t1_d6wof5e,gt That is just a terrible idea. People controlling their own property is a terrible idea?gt Dont let unvaccinated people on your property?Thats right dont do it.gt How can you tell? You cant tell by looking. How do schools tell now? Think about it before you spout your mouth off. You keep official records. People who want onto private property will have to show they have been vaccinated by a trusted provider and certified as vaccinated.gt Also pretty sure youd have trouble stopping unvaccinated people from going to church going to the grocery store or WalMart. Lets just get everybody vaccinated.I dont think you would have any trouble because to even get into the city in the first place you would need to be vaccinated the city being made up of private property entirelyprivate cities would not have the assumption of public roads like youre thinking of right now.You do not need to force people to be vaccinated that is unethical tyranny.But what you can control is who you let on your property. That is the libertarian way of dealing with the problem of vaccination.Any other answer is statist.,Libertarians,d6wum66,0,t5_32zaf
