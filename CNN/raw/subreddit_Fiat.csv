1009626,0,t3_25mynw,My wife and I did  miles in just over  days in my   Sport. We tackled the drive in the middle of the winter.I was worried the seats would be uncomfortable but it was honestly not too bad. The only thing that we found challenging was constantly getting blown around by the wind. Comes with small car territory though.Id make a note of Fiat dealerships along your route just in case you run into any trouble. Ive found that in the plains of the US its not too uncommon to be  miles from the nearest dealership at any given point. Minor repairs can become a pain.,Fiat,chj1vui,2,t5_2r0g3

1774436,0,t3_2eqmk4,Ive swapped so many springs around to find one that meets the ride quality I want as well as the lowered look that I want as well was a challenge.I first had the Madness Aggressive  springs. The lowered look was nice but the ride quality was shameful. It was like driving on a pogo stick over any bumps and camber changes. Not fun. Then I swapped over to NeuF springs recalled rears recalled because they sat higher than the ones they normally sell. These were great because they came with shorter front bumpstops which was the biggest problem with the Madness ones and another reason why they are all rusty because the springs smacked on top of each coil.The rears are a  minute job to swap out. The fronts are a bit harder. You shouldnt need a spring compressor to swap the fronts out but its best to get one anyway.I swapped out the stock rear shocks for Koni yellows and have them set at  of a turn firmer than stock but not too much to shake your teeth out. I also swapped out the rear bumpstops to Energy Suspension  bumpstops. Planning on swapping out the front shocks for Koni sports soon.,Fiat,ck2tmef,1,t5_2r0g3

Took the car in and they repainted it and got it back to me the next day.Ive owned a lot of carsClassics BMW Series XJ Golf R etc but the dollar to smile ratio on the Abarth is hard to beat.

6233693,0,t3_40y4ba,I havent experienced these issues on my  but I can say that the gas gauge has never been accurate on mine.  I know from experience that I get about  miles on a full tank of gas.  I reset the trip meter with each fillup and it shows a full tank until I hit  miles then it shows half a tank until  miles then it drops pretty quickly.  Luckily it starts to become accurate when the tank is nearing empty but Ive learned to just base when to stop for gas on mileage since the last fillup not on what the gas gauge says.  Also the clock runs fast  about one minute every  days.  After a month its  minutes ahead.,Fiat,cyy7bl3,1,t5_2r0g3

9999206,0,t3_5iq5zw,When they eventually release a newer generation  Id love to see better quality interiors. The  nuova Ive driven here in Italy is already a step in the right direction with the minor styling refresh but the lowgrade interior plastics need to go. Its the one factor on my vehicle that heavily detract from the experience. At the same time I dont want to see the  turn into another mockery of what it used to be like Mini Cooper that has increased in size considerably and no longer drives like a proper MiniThe focus should always remain on these points History and Heritage of the brand Leading engine technology inspired by entire Fiat group Fine Italian quality styling and design Compactness and lightweight specifications Enjoyable engaging driving characteristics For Abarth variants FerrariRacing inspired technology and performance components,Fiat,dbaxbab,1,t5_2r0g3
