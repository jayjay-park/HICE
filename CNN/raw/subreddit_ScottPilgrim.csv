1429314,0,t3_2aht5i,Wallace is in fact Scotts trainermentor. Hes also his support system. I wouldnt be surprised if Mr. amp Mrs. Pilgrim were complimenting Wallaces income as to take care of Scott. As to The Glow youll need to continue reading the series. Can you elaborate on the third question? Give some context? I cant seem to find anything.The movie is fantastic. Its different obviously but as far as adaptations go Id say its pretty fantastic. Definitely at least try it after youve finished the series. ,ScottPilgrim,civfwnj,5,t5_2seyg

8602181,0,t3_4vljr9,I actually saw an article in game informer about the game and how it was a classic brawler. Thats my all time favorite game genre so i figured i should watch the movie before playing the game. Saw it loved it. Discovered the comic books. Loved them. Became obsessed. Seriously i watch the movie or read the books anytime i get sad. Works every time!,ScottPilgrim,d6gv7hp,1,t5_2seyg
