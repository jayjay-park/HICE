4556644,0,t1_ct4pqzi,Well actually it said on the can that it may smoke and stink for a bit and thats completely normal.  Though I did see the paint coming off in one spot though I may just not have gotten that spot good so I sprayed it again. I havent run it today.  I stripped it almost completely to the bare frame and primered everything.Then I wheeled it outside and got a bunch of built up dirt and grime off the frame with a pressure washer.Painting it all glossy black tomorrow.  The body pieces anyways.  Gonna do the same with the rims as soon as I get the tires off.  After that the rear suspension linkage the front fork the frame and then the engine.Then sometime maybe next week Ill put it back together.  Itll be like a brand new bike.,MyLittleMotorhead,ct4zh7e,2,t5_2v8pu
