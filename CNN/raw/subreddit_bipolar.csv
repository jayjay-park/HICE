My family does this with each others quirks or they act like the person is bad. Its harmful.I dont know if you have bipolar are you familiar with anxiety disorders by the way? but you clearly have something that is causing your problems. Just push them for a doctor visit.

143521,0,t1_ceuk7f7,I dont think you should look at who you are in reality as a disorder. You are who you are just like everyone is else how they are. Everyone has certain characteristics that makes them different and you just like us on this subreddit just happened to have a few of those in common. Look at it this way lets say were apples. Our doctors are able to identify how were shaped a little roundish yellow green or red. But we all have so much more to this some of us smell nicer than other some taste sweeter some have more seeds...etc.... Identifying yourself as strictly bipolar is like saying Im the red apple. Youre leaving out the taste the smell the texture all those little things that identify you as whole. I believe that everyone is bipolar to a certain extent all of us as humans have feelings and go through good and bad ones. We just get a little more taste of the extremes. We just have to stick it out when times seem a little darker but we also enjoy the light of day more than others. Its alright well make it through all of us. Keep a strong mentality through the shit times it will be fine. Take every day as it comes there will be tomorrow. Good luck my friends hope you find peace and love.,bipolar,ceus0e7,3,t5_2qnv4

However I find it hard to get and strong emotions about anything whilst on this dose.I actually dropped my dose over Christmas just so I could get excited about it with my son then ramped back up for the new year.My big issue whilst manic is rage I lose my shit in an instant. Luckily Ive been given lamotragine mg a day which is a rage suppressant.Hopefully itll mean I can bring down my lithium dose a bit and start to get excited about things again.

224238,0,t1_cf3xd8n,Support groups are not therapy.  They are places for information exchange support and sharing of resources. Group therapy is very different and includes confronting members on their behavior.I dont think a lot of people use them for a few reasons one being that they are afraid of being perceived a certain way by the group as either not sick enough or two sick and two because they come to a group and think they are higher functioning than others.  The latter pisses me off the most because everyone starts their wellness journey from their own rock bottom  and those groups are to support each other and not to judge.If I hadnt gone to those groups I wouldnt have learned about the dangers of SSRI and tricyclic medications about clubhouses about how to avoid triggers and spot symptoms how to make a safety plan and how to make friends again.  All of it I learned by listening to what works for other people.So yes I think these groups are highly underutilized.  But I also do not think they are a substitute for therapy and should not be used as such.  Members should not monopolize the group and use it for their own private therapy session.  Mental health coverage in the USA is ok now that laws have changed. If insurance says only x number of visits the psychologist or therapist can request more and will be granted due to the diagnosis being a long term mental illness.  ,bipolar,cf3zi97,1,t5_2qnv4

237483,0,t3_1wr0gj,stimulants work for some bipolar folks. im one of them. its far from textbook treatment paths. different things work for different people. BUT there is a sense of maturity and discipline needed if you need this path. vary your dose depending on what you need. if you feel like you are abusing you probably are. cut back the dose! its the same if you drink too many mountain dews or coffee. its not a good feeling but you have the energy! thats what you are doing to yourself. stop doing the dew! just know that awesome at everything is hypomania. and with the stimulants you are artificially pushing that. if you arent aware you are having a natural hypomanic episode a very bad road will be ahead. listen to your body it will tell you are doing something wrong. and by what you have written you are doing something wrong. with drugs like adderall its a controlled substance for a reason. now that im saying varying your dose. im only talking about with stimulants like adderall. dont mess around with your lamictal and lithium. those are stabilizers and they need to stay stable so they can keep you stable. that advice is from experience... i wasnt varying my dose when i was having natural highs and i would have physchosis and delusions. i did this for  years and i got tired of that high. it wasnt fun anymore. so i went the seroquel route. the antipsychotics were calming. it was nice... silence.... then my boss had a heart to heart talk with me. he said that i should start looking for another job. he knows about me being bipolar. and he said you still have the ups and downs. but your ups disappeared. you go into deep depressions and only come half back. if you need  maybe we could look at short term medical leave was the most sobering statement i have ever heard in my life. now ive gone back to the wellbutrin and adderall combo. but im much more mature about it. i just use it to keep me out of the catacombs of hell. when i come back up i pay attention to my body. i strip back the stimulants and let my natural high keep me going. i am playing chemist every day. and its a lot of work. but its how i keep my life going. id much more prefer to take a steady dose of something... but sadly that doesnt work for me. if you arent in tune with your body stay away from this method. ,bipolar,cf5d5m4,2,t5_2qnv4

407954,0,t3_1yqbgn,Im a  year old male. The last  years doctors have suggested I apply for SSDSSI. I was stubborn and wanted to prove them wrong. I kept trying to work. Finally  years ago I started the process of applying.  months after applying I was denied. I reapplied denied  months later. I got a lawyer after the Second denial. Two years later I went in front of a judge and was approved. It has been life changing. Once approved you receive back pay from the moment of disability.  Disability lawyers only get paid if you are approved. They are capped at a certain percentage also.  of your initial back pay. My first check was almost  figures after the lawyer received their check.  I now receive a monthly check that is almost .  Your pay depends on how much you have earned over your lifetime. I had payed into the system over  years. So what I earn from disability is a lot more then someone in their s who has only worked a couple years.  You have absolutely nothing to lose by applying. You have everything to gain. ,bipolar,cfn1ulw,2,t5_2qnv4

The host Michael Landsberg has been very public about his depression and the story is about how he feels to an extent but more about player Wade Belak and communication and interpretation. The Trying to Understand section gets pretty depressing so you can stop there if youre worried.Here is the story. Take a few minutes to read if you have the time.Ive always been a huge Leafs fan and grew up watching the team on which Belak played a minor defensive role but was known as a goon. He was drafted as a skill player but was used as an enforcer and was frequently interviewed because he was a friendly and funny guy.I usually dont bat an eye at celebrity deaths but Wades upset me a ton. Once everything came out about how he had felt for years it really hurt me the way things ended up and to know that I could identify with what he had gone through.EDIT Sorry not really what he had gone through but the feelings that he had had for years.,bipolar,cg2a79f,2,t5_2qnv4

Also being bipolar comprises a lot of putting on an elaborate mask for the family coworkers etc. Bipolar people typically do have considerable control in this area.

I go through sadness anger selfloathing racing thoughts wanting to die wanting to live. ..etc all the time. I had a massive breakdown two years ago. I have tried to kill myself three times. When i first tried  I spend  minutes on hold with the suicide hotline then i called every therapist i could find. All were booked for months. No one cared. I was crying. ..begging for help. Nothing.  So I swallowed pills. Since then i have been on and off  Med combos.  I had to leave my wellpaying job of  years because i couldnt get out of bed. I blew through all my savings and k. Then i got disability BUT they have me medicaid that doesnt cover my illness.  It only covers pap smears and birth control. How the fuck do they expect me to get better if i cant treat it.  Right now Im paying  a month for meds  psychiatrist  physiologist. After that I barely have enough money to live on. I dont have family here. Today I had to put  in my car to go to my psychiatrist to get my meds. Running on fumes.I called the social security office  times this month. They all tell me something different and dont know answers to anything. So I get pissed. I want to get back to working but nothing they are doing is helping. I saId well I May just kill myself because you clearly dont give a shit.  ...they called the cops. But i told him my frustration and he understood and left. I WANT to get better.  I want meds or whatever it takes to fix my brain. But this place should be a safe place to speak. We can tell people it gets better but sometimes it doesnt. Why is it our job to decide whether someone should live or not.  Living in pain just so family doesnt grieve? What about death with dignity in Oregon for cancer patients?  That person totally overstepped their boundry and now will make everyone hesitant to post their issues because of fear.  You should be able to opt out. You can refuse treatment  if you want. I think you should get treatment if you arent getting it now but our system is so fucked up You have to be rich to get meds. How do they expect us to get better? How. Im writing a book because so many people are going through this bullshit. We need to speak up.Im in VA. I went to a low income mental health center before i got disability.  If you are in Va I can give you their info. I cant go because I have disability now. Which sucks because my dr appointments were   bucks before including meds. Now its hundreds of dollars. I actually miss mania. Now when Im off meds im just depressed. Regardless if you are manic or not right now  WE ARENT HERE TO JUDGE. Especially people with bipolar.

Ill be horribly massively depressed for  weeks.Sometimes I think back to before my girlfriend broke up with me. I keep telling myself that I still love her. Ill hang out with her and see the way she looks at me and delusionally believe that she still has feelings for me. Sometimes these take over and I cant pay attention to anything school work my friendships. I might have to stay away from her for a while and maybe the fantasies will go away. It sucks because shes my anchor and with her I was a lot more stable. Id like to keep a friend.Those are bad and sometimes there are fantasies where I do see myself moving away and starting new. I dream about moving from New York to Chicago and living in a city all of the time. Or moving to another country. I know I cant I have a lot of friends here who care about me and leaving them would be heartbreaking to me and them so I feel sort of trapped. They dont necessarily understand how I think and feel and sort of view this whole mixed episode thing as not serious or real. As an excuse for my shitty behavior and crazy thinking.Fantasizing and ruminating is definitely one of my biggest problems I dont know if I can conquer it. Sometimes I dont want to. Sometimes I like the place Im living in in my head. Thats a slippery slope though and it could lead to worse conditions down the road.But yes I do get your point.

Same things you described violent rages obsessing over something to the point of meltdown and I was also particularly clever. Id lie about odd things more so than other children and the lies were unusually clever for my age. As an example when I was three I slapped myself across the face in order to trick a stranger nearby into thinking my mother hit me. Began shouting that Id call the police or something of that nature.

My drinking went from nightly to nightly blackouts drinking earlier and earlier then eventually drinking around the clock. If i went more than  hours without a drink i would start going through withdrawals. My hands shook even the smallest sound startled me my legs shook when i walked down stairs which was horribly difficult to do. I vomited everything i ate or drank for  days and i suffered at least  seizures. I had both auditory and visual hallucinations. This happened several times. Im  days sober today again.If you feel that you need alcohol to function i recommend that you stop drinking and talk to your doctor as soon as possible. I know many alcoholics who suffer from mental health issues. YOU DO NOT WANT ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE TO HAPPEN TO YOU. Being an alcoholic is hell. Being an alcoholic in recovery is tough but really wonderful. In a perfect world i would be able to drink booze responsibly. Alas i am a regular ole run of the mill alcoholic and abstinence is all the relationship i can have with alcohol or any other mind altering drug.Being bipolar is rough. Alcohol seems like an easy answer but theres a damn good reason alcohol isnt used to regulate moods. It has way too many adverse side effects and the risk of addiction and dependence is too great. Like i said get with your doc and see about changing up your meds. If youre drinking now you are just damaging yourself as your meds wont work the way they should and youre playing with fire.

Be wary of the side effects and effects for that matter. I found that the people in charge of the whole process were very dismissive and didnt seem to pay much attention to what it was doing to me.

Too much behavioral grey area.  But I get what youre trying to say.My distaste for the meds is not so much from my experience with the meds themselves but rather with the pattern in which I notice shrinks prescribing themTry this one  Oh it didnt work and made you feel like shooting up a mall?  Ok try this one  It made you stay in bed all weekend without eating? Ok try this one ...... rinse  repeat.  More than a couple shrinks have done the exact same thing.I agree its the only option.. or nearly the only one but what I notice is a complete lack of any intelligent science in prescribing meds and also I notice that doctors care very little about your sense of self identity and purpose in life and care almost exclusively about your chemical balance... or better put  what they perceive to be your chemical balance... which again... seems to be a straight up trial and error method that a  year old could conduct by marking down Xs on a sheet of paper next to each med.Im just generally disgusted with how bad it is and how all they are really doing is trying to induce the right high to get you through it.  How much different are they really from a drug dealer who society frames as villains?And were not even getting into my distrust due to all their ties to the pharma industry.Also and im rambling now I realize... Im not entirely convinced that bipolar is something wrong with us.  It could be that society is bad for us and not that we are fucked up.  Maybe were not meant for this level of complexitystress in life.  Maybe if we were homesteaders or something wed be perfectly happy and balanced rather than having to commute to work in the morning with a million idiots on the road...I think modern society has a level of oppression to it that hasnt ever existed before.

If he continues to drink his prognosis will be very poor. The reason he cannot drink isnt the medications although many have some warnings but the disorder itself. Drinking increases the frequency and severity of future episodes which could include more hospitalizations. If he has a drinking problem he needs to get help to stop drinking. Like taking medications staying sober is a requirement.Im happy to hear that he is feeling a bit better today.

You are certainly a brave and strong person given that you have spoken about your experiences on here therefore you are certainly capable overcoming your selfconfidence issue. Again my suggestion is speak to your psychiatrist. Therapy at the very least can help.I know bipolar can be daunting it is a constant challenge that I believe brings out great courage. I see my SOs courage yes there will be days she dont feel like like it but in my honest opinion she has more courage to face any challenge then I have seen in anyone else I know including myself. Noting your past experiences my thoughts are to learn from them and remember that it is not you it is something you experienced. I have strong doubt youre are in anyway a fuckup.

Crazy retrograde amnesia forgot I watched the end of a football game suddenly feeling like I was really drunk took it on the couch and almost could not walk to the bed  minutes later and worse... and then.Right now I take lamotrigine mg twice a day morning and just before bed. as well as clonazepam klonopin .mg up to x a day but usually less than that. The key is to take the lamictal and one klonopin literally just before I lie down  they digest pretty quickly.So I hate to ask but do you take medication? If you are having sleep problems and panic issues Klonopin might be a very good choice for you. Benzodiazepines can be addicting but Klonopin is a little more slowacting than Xanax so the addiction potential is less.Be well.,bipolar,cht5tog,2,t5_2qnv4

1183983,0,t3_27ohen,I get where youre coming from about not wanting the way you are to be altered. I hear what youre saying. But I think it is fair to consider that life isnt just all about an individuals wants and needs. It is important to at least loosely live within the constructs of society. You might not want to stop the things you do during episodes but family friends and just the people you encounter deserve to be treated decently. You cant guarantee them that if youre having episodes left and right. As to stopping meds. You should be guided through that by your doctor. If you come off lithium too quickly it can lose its efficacy if you need it in the future. You are also more likely to be thrown into an episode if you go off too quickly. Im in the process of going off my lithium and lamictol right now as Im hoping to get pregnant and intend to go back on as soon as necessary  even if I need to readdress how to go about having a child. My doctor had to draw up a plan for how to wean me off of my meds and she had to prescribe new dosages of my pills. I dont think its fair to consider going off of meds until you have developed a habit of healthy lifestyle choices. Think of it like a science experiment. You cant consider what meds are or are not doing for you when adding in the variable of alcohol. If you have poor sleep habits thats another variable. If you have poor eating habits thats another variable. The point is that bipolar is affected by so many things. Until you have all of the nonmed things in check you dont have a clear picture. Also if you are willing to influence your state with alcohol what makes influencing your state with meds an inferior choice? I grew up with a father who used alcohol rather than meds to influence himself with his bipolar. I was one of the loved ones that was collateral to his decisions. Please dont think too lightly about your impact on those around you.Finally I give this advice in most of my posts a good therapist is an invaluable resource. ,bipolar,ci2tfj2,1,t5_2qnv4

Anyhow this past week I really had to come to grips with the fact my sister will NEVER be the one I can turn to in an emotional crisis she has  instincts towards comforting or helping people emotionally.  It doesnt mean she hates me or anything just that we will never be as close as we used to be.  Your uncle sounds like a douche not comparing the emotional tole this is having on you to my own issues my sister can be a bitch but would never go that far just trying to tell you you arent alone.   People with mental illness go one of two ways after they get better or are in successful treatment  they either become someone who understands mental illness better and has empathy towards the mentally ill or people who think I got better why the hell arent you better yet?  You must be weakoverly emotionala drama queen etc.  The second type is someone you want to avoid getting emotionally attached to because they will just suck you dry of self esteem even worse than you may already be.  Id say making sure you find a place to live that isnt your uncles house is the most important thing you can do.

Suddenly it switched to this monster that made me even more anxious. But I couldnt shake the habit and occasionally it would make me feel better so I held onto hope and kept doing it. I also loved how it separated me from reality so I could pretend like my problems were in the distance for a while. But eventually it became clear that it was just hurting me. So I quit for years.

Lost my position at a new place that was a k increase in salary and came with more prestige than my old place and sure promises of fast promotion and development.. Proceeded to ensure that I would never work in the field again.. Burned through k in savings and retirement savings.. Almost lost my SO to this fucking illness.. Survived downright medical negligence that Im now being billed for and contemplating opening a suit against.. Am now living with my sister until I get back on my feet.But...Im still relatively young. I can use my professional experience in my new business and my personal experience to be one tough muthafucker. Writing which had taken a backseat while I was experiencing career success has come alive for me again. Im releasing myself from the idea that I need to get a job when what I really need is to secure the means for living and undertaking a potentially hazardous  job isnt the only way to make .If we were facebookcomparing Im a screwup. Im in debt. I have no clear answer to What do you do? My dreams of home ownership have been postponed indefinitely. But for the first time in years Im at peace with myself. The future is scary because I know Im doing something that not everybody does and there is no certainty of success.But back when I was doing what I was supposed to be doing there was no certainty of success either and it was very bad for my health. Everything could fall apart but I reason Ive already lived through everything falling apart. And Im still fucking here.DID YOU HEAR THAT UNIVERSE? IM STILL FUCKING HERE AND IM DOING IT MY WAY THIS TIME.Im still going to have bad days and trials and tribulations but my definition of nothing has changed.

1849731,0,t3_2frfvx,Violence is the single most important thing that must be addressed. If current medication is not preventing violent outbursts its vital that you attempt to look into options that might be able to. The other stuff such as dealing with the condition through therapy and counseling and less debilitating medication come AFTER halting violent behavior. Its actually not super prominent with bipolar disorder to have violent outbursts so it could be a combination of your sons age stage of development and possibly a severe case of the condition or even a misdiagnosis.Im not a doctor but I just wanted to additionally mention that the circumstances youve described and the age your son is exhibiting this behavior at is not uncommon in cases of sexual abuse. I dont know if thats something that has occurred to your sons doctors or to you as a parent but children quite predictably develop emotional problems and often start violently lashing out at young ages when they have been victims of abuse. Something to think about because its my understanding that behavioral issues at this severity at such a young age are not the norm when it comes to bipolar disorder alone..but they are quite common with abuse victims.,bipolar,ckc36qt,2,t5_2qnv4

1898152,0,t1_ckhvwa7,Thanks for taking the time to look it up.   Ive been on Lamictal for years with the addition of anti psychoticsbenzos during  a couple acute manic episodes but due to not great tolerance discontinued after the episodes are over and Lamictal seems to work well as a mood stabilizer.   But then but then had to try several anti depressants after a really bad depression that lasted a couple years at suicidal level and finally found one that helped. It was unusual in that my normal lol is hypomanic besides a few short depressions and the manic ones.Anyway the last episode before this was mixed and I was fired by one dr because I refused to take lithium or depakote.  He wanted to add it to my current meds.  topamax lamictal wellbutrin and prazosin.  I got picked up by another dr in the same clinic but I have an appt next week and I have a feeling she will now insist on one of them and thats why Im looking for an anti manic mood stabilizer alternative that I can propose. They gave me haldol and seroquel to stop this episode and it really worked so Im very glad of that because it was great for a while but then turned to being too out of control and I started to get in trouble and people started to get upset about it.The other dr shot down every other suggestion I had but I dont think I suggested this one.Im afraid of lithium because I dont want a tremor and I dont want my thyroid or kidneys to be affected.

1915667,0,t3_2gjx1s,I dont mean to down talk your dad because Im sure you love him and he has probably helped out more than it seems but I feel like he is letting a lot of this come down on you.  He chose to be with her and have children with her it should be the responsibility of them to take care of you not the other way around.My mother is Bipolar and when things are bad they are bad and it does affect my life but my father has been absolutely wonderful about it.  He does not have temper problems though so I guess that is where it differs.  He is extremely kind and patient with her but he also knows how to be firm.  Maybe your dad could go to some private counseling to work on his temper? She needs to learn that somebody does need to monitor her taking her pills in order to stop hurting her loved ones.  Most of this in my family has come down on my dad.  He has done his best to keep it from harming my brother and I and honestly we have a pretty healthy family dynamic and she will be stable and wonderful for years at a time with only minor relapses.  I think a thing that helped them a lot was going to group counseling for bipolar couples.  It helped them connect with other people helped my dad realize how he could help more and helped my mom realize exactly what she was doing.  Maybe you can sit down with your dad and have a talk about how something serious needs to be done and you wish he would do more than argue with her and contribute to her anger.

1989449,0,t3_2hi7ku,Problems here . Your friends psychiatrist went to school for a long time and went through a lot of training in order to become a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist knows far more about psychiatry than your friend does. If your friend believes that they really do have ADHD a second opinion from a different doctor is a good idea. . A mg dose is pretty low so it probably wouldnt trigger mania  but consider that your friend may and most likely will ask for a higher dose because its a low dose and doesnt give the result theyre looking for. Where do you draw the line? Just dont do it at all and avoid the problem.. Think of this as well  say you were to give your friend a tablet and things DID spiral out of control and your friend somehow ended up hurt. Do you want to feel responsible for something like that? I have asked friends for stimulants in the past for studying purposes and it is VERY difficult to figure out your own correct dosage.  I now have an ADHD diagnosis and my treatment is mg Adderall XR in the morning and mg Adderall IR at PM on days I have class in the evening. I never would have determined correct dosage with the  or so mg IR tablets I was getting for exams. If your friend does have ADHD they need the direction of a psychiatrist in order to treat it. And what is your friend planning on doing if the Ritalin does work? Is your friend going to march into the psychiatrists office and say hey doc I know you said I dont have ADHD but tried taking Ritalin that I obtained illegally and it worked so I guess you were wrong!Giving your friend Ritalin is going to be unhelpful at best and dangerous at worst. Dont do it. EDIT I can use myself as an example of how unpredictable stimulants can be  last week I had exams. I didnt take more of my medication than usual just the mg pills once a day but I did forget a couple doses of my mood stabilizer and in combination with no sleep... ended up hypomanic. Definitely got scolded during my med check yesterday.,bipolar,cksxgfs,4,t5_2qnv4

2332496,0,t1_clz6u8p,Thats interesting about pleasure vs. selfdestruction. I feel like I chase those those for different reasons at different times. Sometimes it is about pleasure if Im manic and sometimes about selfdestruction if Im depressed. Or thats how it seems to me.Yeah I feel like there is something deeper going on with me too and Im not sure how to address it. And Im also scared to identify with BPD because I knew a girl who emotionally abused everyone in her life and really hurt me who had BPD and I dont feel like I could have the same condition she does. But Im sure that not everyone with BPD treats people like dirt. I need to get over that prejudice. She just really did a number on me.I usually get into those states of mind when Ive been depressed or manic for a while but not usually if Ive been really scared by something. I guess Ive felt that way while high...but its different than when it happens naturally. I usually get them when things feel like too much...when stress or sadness or both are high. I feel like something just snaps and I stop being a part of the world and just start observing it or feeling like nothing is real and nothing matters.It surprised me that you asked about trauma...I often feel like I should have been traumatized as a child from the way I feel about some things but I really dont think I was. I dont remember anything happening that would make me so fearful of some things. I got bullied a little in school by friends and switched schools at one point. But that seems fairly common. I had shingles as a child which was horrible but more painful than emotional. I was sick a lot. I had a lot of complete breakdowns in high school selfharmed suffered from anorexia and had my heart broken a few times but do those count as trauma? I had a period in my life when I was  that had me planning on killing myself...I taught at a summer camp where I was trapped in the middle of nowhere being ruthlessly bullied while my relationship with my serious boyfriend deteriorated due to his alcoholism and our emotional problems and then my boyfriend broke up with me because I cut myself and I still have flashbacks to that summer camp and that breakup that fill me with panic and intolerable anxiety. Ive wondered if I could have PTSD from that time but I feel like my problems have not been bad enough compared to people who actually have PTSD. Sorry this was long.

2341775,0,t3_2m5c1p,I am  years old with bipolar  disorder. I was diagnosed when I was about . I was young and grew up without drinking alcohol or smoking weed. I was scared of pharmaceuticals but I didnt have a choice. I was put on every medication that exists for BP that I could find and nothing seemed to help at least to the extent that I wanted it to.  About a year ago  years into art school I began smoking regularly. My doctors were all against it but I was desperate for an alternative.  Now that I know a little more about myself and what I am putting in my body I am completely off of pharmaceuticals and I smoke Indicas to stabilize my mood as needed. I dont recommend doing this and I doubt most doctors would but I have found what personally works for me at least so far. I am happy and comfortable and moving forward in life. You being bipolar as well also know that this could change in the blink of an eye.  My girlfriend and her family are completely comfortable about what I am doing and they understand my condition they are military psychologists. They agree that the weed has helped me by far the most with literally almost no negative side effects. This weighs in heavily when considering the side effects of the available BP medications today.  Also I am a stoner but you wouldnt be able to tell. I remain productive and maintain a semihealthy lifestyle despite the amount of weed smoked to stay stable.  It has changed my life and has helped me tremendously but be careful its not for every bipolar person.  I hope this helps and I hope everyone in this thread can find what helps them. Edit I have only been smoking vaping regularly nearly every day for about a year now so I can only really speak for short term use. I like to think I will remain this stable and feel like I do at this point in my life forever thanks to marijuana but being bipolar I know that that obviously probably wont happen.  It may only be a temporary fix but I am treating it like medicine and not abusing it and letting it interfere or takeover my actual life.  From my personal experience I have learned that I am happiest and most comfortable living in the present so if it works for now I will continue carrying on as usual.  Good luck,bipolar,cm15mbw,10,t5_2qnv4

Its good to do whatever improves your life and we all have different experiences and it sounds like you have good insight as to what is happening for you.Ive always had the sleep problems as well before and after medication. I found seroqual at mg helped me greatly but then it stops working and getting off it gave me insomnia for a month. It was a real bitch. I also gained a fair bit of weight on one medication though it probably saved my life. It would be nice if the medication fixed everything but it doesnt. I also had heaps of problems with getting medication to work. I kept going because I believed in it and ive got lucky with it.

I went and they told me I needed an appointment so I emailed asking for one and included all of the things I need taken care of. Thank you for the suggestion of asking about trying to get my disability recognized by the school! I asked about that as well.Hopefully they refer me to a place like you described in your fourth bullet point it would be nice to have someone clear up the uncertainty I have about all of this for good.Im going to try and get an appointment with a therapist that is sooner hopefully they will click with me as well as the one that is booked out so far.

And in my psychosis I thought I must have deserved this so Im really an evil person. And I saw myself becoming like a demon in hell because that must be what I really am.Its been a year now but I still get these panic attacks. That something in there really was evil or that I did or thought something that was like me choosing to go to hell and now I really will I die. I start to imagine all the awful ways Id be tortured.I know it doesnt really work that way. That the pop culture version of hell was just from Dantes imagination. There isnt really an eternity of torture. Its more like just death. And I know that I couldnt sin while I was completely out of my mind insane and had no capacity for rational thought. And even if I could Ive confessed Im absolved of my sins and Im saved.Still the experience took a lot of the joy out of my life. Those horrors were just in my mind but they exposed me for being a coward and lacking faith. And some people face those kinds of horrors in reality. Victims of murder and rape and torture. It made me dwell on the horrors of existence.Ive found myself more often begging God for mercy rather than thanking and praising him for my life. It wasnt like that before.

2725456,0,t1_cnds1wb,I like that attitude. I find that I have a pretty similar one but I come at it from a more pessimistic point of view. I find that when bad things happen even if they are completely random the only way they can possibly improve or change is if you take responsibility for it regardless of the cause. From a practical standpoint it seems to me that any other approach leaves you vulnerable and holds you back.That said what Im looking at is the problem of identity. I wondered for a long time  Is a person defined by their motivations or their actions? I ultimately came to the conclusion that the best measure of a person is the process by which their motivations turn into actions if that makes any sense.If youre under the influence of a drug it alters your brain chemistry which can alter motivations as well as the process through which they turn into actions. Similarly the bipolar mood swings as well as their side effects have effects on the chemistry of the brain. Again either way from a practical standpoint youre stuck with your actions. But the problem of identity comes out. If youre on drugs its generally considered that the person you are when youre high is a warped version of you. If the person you are during a mood swing is not you then youll end up not being yourself most of the time. On the other hand if you decide that its all you then the answer to the question Who am I? is Depends on the day. Which I find problematic.,bipolar,cndvfxk,1,t5_2qnv4

Specifically we also went through several series of video classes that covered different topics like how to deal with manipulative people something I had trouble with DBT for bipolar and games people play  That was really interesting stuff too.

But if he is bipolar he needs to get on some sort of meds especially given the swings you describe.Unlike other posters Im not going to try to convince you to break up since that seems like something youre unwilling to do. I think the big thing is that you cant let him walk over you. Or hell just keep on doing it.He needs to be on mood stabilizers or something. Or addressing these problems. I cannot say enough that dealing with this is not your responsibility. I tried that with my girlfriend. It doesnt work. He needs to see these as problems.Try to even bring it up to him when hes in a normal phase. Tell him how much it actually hurts you. If he actually cares for you that will be a trigger for him to fix it.,bipolar,cosm0jw,2,t5_2qnv4

My urges to self harm were higher and my moods were all over the place. I cant speak for how they may affect you or others though.

3317440,0,t3_2y45wq,I was on Ambien for a while and it worked like a charm for about a year before I built up too high of a tolerance to it for my insurance company to give me as much as I needed.  Hallucinations and blackouts are completely normal on it and happen to pretty much everyone. I found it pretty fun personally but that makes it highly susceptible to abuse I knew a guy in high school who used to snort it as a matter of fact.I tried Trazadone but that basically made me nonfunctional in the daytime as well since it would hit me for about  hours with a dose.I would also use Benadryl sometimes and while the sleepaid effect was unreliable the cats really liked my bed so I needed to take it anyway.I also tried Rozerem which is basically an artificial melatonin thats safe to use with SSRIs but it had a very limited effect.Now Ive been alternating between Xanax and Clonazepam. I build up a tolerance to drugs unusually quickly so I take one for a few months then switch. Clonazepam has a significantly longer halflife in the body and can give me issues in the morning so I like Xanax more. They also both double as anxiety medications for me to help with hypomanic episodes.,bipolar,cp6f01l,1,t5_2qnv4

Li brought me out of a  month and very dark depression. I find that my mind is cloudy more days than not and that my whit has slowed down considerably. This probably has more to do with the fact that I use marijuana as a sleep aid. That aside I still measure things via pros and cons. In this case I may be cognitively delayed but Im not miserable or lashing out or crashing every other week.

3457065,0,t3_2zu063,I was recently hospitalized for  weeks.  Mixed state.  Suicidality.Im an MSPhD student in Clinical Psychology.  Imagine how those conversations looked like. EditI checked myself in ahem voluntarily. By voluntarily I mean that my school psychologist told me I had  days to check myself in or she would call the local police department to do it for me.But yes I was there because of the suicidality. They tried to medicate me but as any welltrained psychiatrist will tell you figuring out medication for a first mixed episode is an art. An art that takes time patience quality training experience and a shitload of luck. There were really none of those things available for me in the hospital unfortunately. We saw the psychiatrist for around  minutes every day. My meds were changed every day pretty much. By the time I was released I was not on a stable regimen at all.All the hospitalization really did was make sure I couldnt kill myself for a period of  weeks. Well it worked and for that I am grateful. Some people think about suicide all the time sure but an acute episode of imminent suicidal risk is temporary and quite timelimited.I checked myself in because I didnt want to become a spectacle. But a part of me also did it because I knew that I was not thinking rationally that I was experiencing a mixed episode with psychotic features and that in  years if a client walked into my office looking like I did I would hospitalize them in a heartbeat.I didnt receive a bipolar diagnosis until after the hospitalization. So that one sojourn was very much some sort of first manichypomanic break. Im in my midtwenties average age for BPII onset is  with a family history of BPI early onset recurrent depression and some serious selfharm issues that had been ongoing for about  years but that I never told anyone about.What tipped me over into compliance was mostly that I took a long hard look at myself and could not deny that I was an absolutely textbook case of imminent risk. I had been experiencing severe severe depression with profound agitation  I couldnt sit still pacing muscle twitching racing thoughts and was experiencing extreme allconsuming rage that was completely undirected. As any psychologist will tell you this kind of activated depression is the most dangerous because not only are you depressed and suicidal youve got truckloads of energy to actually carry that out. Very dangerous. I didnt really appreciate how dangerous my situation was until about a month after I got out. Im human too. I experience denial like everyone else.I still remember my initial checkin with the hospital nurse. I was literally standing there in a hospital gown covered in caked blood and open lacerations switching from foot to foot because I was so fidgety and was twitching so hard I looked like I was seizing.  I think about that picture now and Im like wow.  Just wow.This didnt happen overnight. The acute buildup took around    months. While all this was happening I had to give my social circle  a building full of professional psychologists professors PhDs and advanced graduate students  the impression that I was  fine. That was brutal. On the outside I was sharp and witty and civil but on the inside I was beyond screaming. I was in the tearingmyvoiceboxout phase...well beyond screaming. I downed x dose OTC sleeping aids every morning to keep the agitation down. I had times when I would go catatonic pretty much for about half an hour with no response. I was cutting myself with a box cutter several times on the daily. It was absolutely brutal and I wouldnt wish it on anyone.I dont doubt that it will probably make me a better psychologist. Because now I understand the limitations of hospitalization in terms of what it can and cant actually do for people. I also understand that we are all constantly surrounded by people who appear highachieving and welladjusted but we should remember that when we see others we see only their highlight reels. Backstage passes are rarely so generous.  Never assume.   ,bipolar,cpmbxkp,19,t5_2qnv4

There are a number of things that can cause changes in energy and mood like this and thats why skill mental health people are important.  If you are inclined to Id encourage you to continue down this path.  What about speaking with your counselor more about why she thinks it might be bipolar disorder?  Why not normal?  Why not another disorder which is associated with energeticmood swings?  A second opinion might be useful as well.  From a psychiatrist if possible.Also I dont know if when you were looking at they symptoms of the various bipolar disorders you might have only looked at bipolar I and II.  There is more to it than that.  One of the key reasons to identify bipolar versus a unipolar disorder is that if medication is used antidepressants alone are generally avoided where there are energetic moods.  This post discusses why this is so important.  Energetic cycles dont have to be nearly as significant as those described in BPI and BPII before responsible doctors generally treat differently from a medication standpoint.  If medication treats someones depressive episodes but turns their energetic periods into an irritable agitated mess thats no good.  It can be that subtle.,bipolar,cq2yi8x,1,t5_2qnv4

Was going to make a thread but Ill just put it hereStarted to get really manic was not sleeping or eating began to have some delusions of grandeur I could sense a psychotic episode coming on. I had called my doc a couple days before he put me on mg seroquel. It didnt slow me down. I started to get scared so I went to the ER.Had to fucking scream at the doctor to put me on a  hour hold. He wanted to give me some geodon never taken it and send me home. I told him in my pschotic state I would be a danger to myself or others  even though I had no specific plans to harm anybody right now. Finally he agreed to admit me. Ended up sitting on a bed in the ER for  hours before being taken to the psychiatric hospital. At the psych hospital they gave me mg seroquel XR. that didnt seem to do much at first. but i was able to get about  hours of sleep. and the structure of the hospital was good for me. getting regular food and all of the stimuli was removed of being  outside. the boredom was just what i needed. saw the doctor and he said i was a voluntary patient and could go whenever i wanted. i said one more day at least to calm down some more and be sure i was ok. took seroquel and ambien that night and the next day i was just like tired and lazy all day. felt like i had crashed. just wanted to lay in bed. which is how i always feel when i finally get out of the hospital it just takes weeks usually to get to that point. so i told the doc i was ready to go home. now that im out its the same i just feel lazy and want to lay in bed. not manic at all. still early going but i am really proud of myself. if i stopped this episode in its tracks ill know what to do next time. check myself in to the hospital for a day or two. no big deal at all. nobody even has to know that im gone. much better than turning my whole life upside down with a  month long episode!,bipolar,cqq4vjo,13,t5_2qnv4

If youve had periods of impulse spending in the past it might be good to think about things that went along with it and what happened. If you could do things youll regret you should keep a close eye on it. I can understand wanting to enjoy the hypomania and having less inhibited behavior.

Its something youll have to come to terms with though I understand about largely wanting to put it off for a while particularly while things are enjoyable.

4418526,0,t3_3bndrs,the impacts of marijuana on BP medications is not widely studied. Some meds that work for bipolar also help with seizures similar to marijuana. The issue is when taken together it isnt clear if there is an interaction that doubles the effectiveness or inhibits the binding of certain meds. As medical marijuana is better studied I am sure we will get a better clue.So while weed is a nice thing for the symptoms you have there are also very clean meds that help with the same issue with fewer side effects.

Because thats what happens when I go up  I smoke more than when stable or depressed two to three times my usual amount.I dont know the answer to your question but I would argue that it could also be egg over chicken here your delusions and paranoia were likely causing you a great deal of distress and your response to that distress was likely to smoke more.It is obviously best for your health overall if you cut back on smoking at the very least and more preferably to quit altogether.

Its possible your hypomania doesnt meet criteria for BPII either in length or in symptomology. Its possible youre extremely rapid cycling. Its possible youre a unpolar hypomanic or hyperthymic in temperament. Its possible you have substance abuse issues which can disguise bipolarity.

4665197,0,t3_3eshgq,One of the most effective things Ive found for myself is to try and turn my thoughts into a piece of fiction.I never really finish any story doing this but it helps as a type of release valve to acknowledge the thoughts going through my head compartmentalize them a little bit and then get them out of me. Works well for when I think I have grand realizations about how the world works or think Ive had some great epiphany. Instead of letting the idea run amp run on different tangents or trying to act on it I accept that its fiction or grand thinking and then try to express in a fictional setting how the world would work if my thoughts were true  followed out. Also Ive realized this helps me avoid running off on tangents. If I think the world should do X and I start writing a story where X is true I find that I exhaust myself trying to convey what that really means by trying to make things detailed enough so that someone understands what Im thinking. I think this keeps me from tangents because I just burn out on developing that one thought. This lets me kinda settle down instead of just jumping from idea to idea over the course of hoursdaysweeks. I could ramble on some more about how I think this is beneficial but I think just focusing on something more artistic than logical helps calm stabilize me in general. ex. I used to turn to drawing a little bit. Usually just silly tshirt designs. I think by turning to art rather than doing something analytical it helps the mind stop racing as much but fulfills the need to be expressing myself. Trying to just shut off the mind is almost more painful than overworking it.  ,bipolar,ctilpuw,2,t5_2qnv4

OR find a bunch of hobbies you enjoy so at least you can be accomplishing things on the regular. however you arent as accountable to hobbies as you are to a job.very tough decision but thats some food for thought  good luck!!! ,bipolar,ctxu8r4,2,t5_2qnv4

5115582,0,t1_cv2kjx9,I appreciate your advice on getting treatment.  I would like to go the route that you are talking about.  It would be nice if they understood where I was coming from because I honestly dont trust myself to quit unaided.  I feel like if they were to say get off the drugs and then we will talk about treatment I will just relapse and never get proper treatment.  It doesnt help that when I was in detox the psychiatrist talked to me and said You need to stay away from that stuff one of my patients had a psychotic breakdown from taking it. and I had to ask Do you mean flakka or spice?  Did he have an underlying mental illness? and she just looked at me like I had two heads and that she was offended I had questioned her knowledge.  She probably wasnt too happy with me anyway because I criticised them for only using AA as therapy and for not explaining PAWS to anyone there.  There were people about to leave that have never detoxed before who had never heard of PAWS.  How do they get by with that?  People dont understand kratom and some psychiatrists have no real idea how to treat a dual diagnosis even if the DoC is a well understood drug or even how to treat just substance abuse on its own.  I cant be choosy as to where I get treatment because I am using county insurance through a county mental health program.  I can change clinics but the soonest appointment they could make when I checked  weeks about was in late October.  I cant go another month and a half.  I am still very worried and its getting close to the wire.  I will be seeing them in two days.  I dont know how this is going to work.,bipolar,cv2majo,1,t5_2qnv4
5116879,0,t3_3l2uba,Simplest way of explaining it is by saying that what Im experiencing is like having an amplifier set next to my mood. The mildest annoyances becoming infuriating trivial life concerns become monumental struggles minor setbacks morph into catastrophes and small sadnesses exploded into despairing grief. The quality of the reactions is normal its the intensity thats overwhelming.And other people bring out all sorts of of these little reactions in regular interactions. Thats part of life. Even loved ones can be a tiny bit aggravating at times. Yet I feel what most tend to experience over the course of a year within as short a span as several minutes.It takes a ton of energy to restrain myself. Acting normally in a social setting is more strenuous than an advanced calculus exam. Its a test of willpower and composure. In all frankness thats the only thing separating me from exhibiting full blown Borderline Personality Disorder.Those who tend to understand more are women which makes sense given how many experience similar mood disturbances on a monthly basis. Men tend to be a bit more ego bound and assume their mental stability is purely a product of their selfdetermination and selfdiscipline. Ive found it easiest to say nothing and to retreat into my den of shame. Probably not the best solution but the whole love conquers all bit becomes pointless when I lose the capacity to even feel within that range of emotion.In short my absence of communication is how I communicate how I am doing.

I have to take more meds that most geriatric patients.But if you stick with meds and therapy your life should be relatively normal. It doesnt have to be a death sentence to your life.As far as your fiancebf... well he has a right to feel the way he does. Having to be a potential caregiver is not something many people are cut out forcan handle. But that is entirely his problem. If he cant be with you because you now have a label its not like this illness is sudden youve always had it despite it always being a part of you it will feel sucky at first but there are plenty of people who CAN handle it. Bringing a child into this world... one reason I have decided to be child free. But not the only. Because like I said as long as you stick with your treatment it shouldnt interfere with raising a child. Plenty of bipolar parents have kids.As far as your life... go after it. Do your treatment and follow your passions in life. There is nothing holding you back but you. You are capable of excelling at whatever you do as long as you try.,bipolar,cvbsk15,4,t5_2qnv4

5199948,0,t1_cvcbbus,I wont lie nursing school was tough. The hardest thing I have ever done. However I do love learning so that helped. I still struggled with my bipolar some days I just couldnt get out of bed and go to class. Finding a friend really saved me there  and after all these years we are still best friends. She shared notes with me she shared stories of classmates asking stupid questions. She is my rock and Im so thankful for her. I also found it helpful to study in groups as well as on my own. Brain storming can be so rewarding when everyone is working towards the same goal. As for being a nurse it has its challenges. Ive called in sick  times this year due to not being able to get out of bed because Im just so damn sad. My coworkers and employer know I am bi polar. I dont hide it from people because Im okay with it. That gives me a bit of relief because they know that I am going through something that is out of my control. I think the hardest thing I deal with at work is the death of my residents. I work in long term care so I really get to know my residents before they pass and when I lose someone I have made a connection with with the family too it can be hard to be there when they let go. But I also feel very rewarded when I was able to be there as they passed so I knew they werent leaving alone. All in all I love being a nurse. To this day I have no idea what made me think Im going to be a nurse but it was the right thing to do. I say give it a good thought and decide whether its right for you. I hope Im proof that being a nurse with bipolar is not easy but it is doable. ,bipolar,cvcsc7f,1,t5_2qnv4
5202570,1,t1_cvd39qy,I feel its something I have to do. There are so many people on the other side saying that it does exist. And people whos motive is generally money. I think its more of a fundamental problem with the way modern people are expected to live. Peoples lives are too stressful. We work work work and usually it ends up being all for nothing. Not a lot of people out there are necessarily equipped with the wisdom to decide something for themselves. Im sorry if I offended but like I said I go back and forth on this all the time. When Im down I need help. No denying that. So I grab at straws one of which is believing in the diagnosis. But it seems pretty simple that ya if your life is all fucked up and you hate it that you arent going to feel good or be happy. I think a lot of these doctors dont understand the stresses of life some of the lower class have to deal with. And I wont go into how their entire profession hinges on mental illness existing. I have drawn many comparisons between drug addiction and bipolar. Watched a lot of the show intervention. Went to a lot of AA and NA meetings for myself. Often drug addiction itself is not the problem. There is always an underlying problem that causes the addiction to happen in the first place. I believe the same can be true with mental illness. A lot of us have been through fucked up shit that maybe we never got over or never processed properly. But just taking medication is the same as giving an opiod addict methadone for the rest of their life. Ya they arent shooting heroin anymore but are they really healed? Just all the mantra around bipolar is so wrong. Bipolar cannot be cured. We are human beings weve been to the fucking moon. Cancer is about to be cured. Weve got to have a more open mind and stop putting ourselves in a box. ,bipolar,cvd3pmk,-3,t5_2qnv4

5276143,0,t3_3n8djz,truthfully for me the point of therapy is to learn how to safely navigate my mood swings without professional assistance. My therapist helped me figure out how to utilize the support system around me develop skills and awareness for myself and how to get my support system on board to help me when I cant fix the situation myself.I monitor myself all the time and frequently check in on my bank account spending. I use my credit card for  of my purchases because my bank does a lovely pie chart of how much Im spending monthly quarterly and annually on different categories of purchases from Amazon to medical office visits prescriptions gas grocery and take out. This lets me take a longer view of my bipolar since Ive tracked it pretty close with changes in spending take out and amazon go WAY UP when I am at either extreme.When I am noticing a change I check in with my support system parents siblings and husband and let them know Im having a rough time. I am specific on what I need from them. Sometimes its doing family time and preparing a meal together. My folks usually let me take back the leftovers so I am less likely to give in to the compulsion of Fuckit I dont have anything to make a lunch with Portillos it shall be today!Currently my husband and I share an Amazon account that goes to his email. He will monitor my spending and cut me off with a password change as soon as I tell him I have a problem or he approaches me and asks me about my purchases. I really am excellent at not making excuses and owning up to my part of the problem.So the goals need to be tailored to what would make your successful in navigating your life with confidence in yourself,bipolar,cvm35fx,2,t5_2qnv4

5301316,0,t3_3nkvv9,Oh man I get you. Thats a terrible place to be in I used to be in graduate school and hated having to ask for extensions on homework and tests because of periodically having no energy and selfloathing. And I had absolutely no reason to be that way either I was consistently at the top of my classes but it would hit anyway. I only let one of my profs in on my illness and he understood but I didnt tell the others.Now Im just a guy on the internet so take what I have to say as an idea to think about rather than any firm recommendations but Id still like to put it out there. You may really need some time off for a bit. Maybe only a few days but some. You should still go to your classes if youre still taking classes but get a few days extension on your homework if at all possible. It will relieve a lot of stress. Its up to you how you ask for it and how much you share about the reasons. But if youre doing really well they probably wont have a problem with it if you say its only a few days. During that time spend a lot more time taking care of yourself than working. Eat well go for walks listen to music and spend time with friends. Play a board game or watch a movie with them one night if you and they are able. Not only does it relieve stress but it shows people care about you. I find writing helps me put things in perspective and it helps to get those feelings out. I might not feel much better or I might but at least theyre not bouncing around around in my head as much.Ive been there dude and it sucks but hang in there. Dont give up itll pass. But if you dont want to go back on medications you need to have other tools in your toolbox e.g. this. Or something else but have some kind of plan for when the SHTF. Its just the nature of what we have to deal with. Just remember that because some other people may be able to work straight through stuff without struggling so much from time to time doesnt mean you should also be able to do it. Accepting that you have your own unique needs and those dont make you any less than anyone else is the first step to accepting and loving yourself. Stand up for yourself you deserve it. Youre a very strong person way stronger than you realize for working as hard as you do while also dealing with all the extra stuff you have to push through. Remember that.,bipolar,cvpaz24,3,t5_2qnv4

5314694,0,t3_3np961,Doesnt surprise me at all. We dont even fully know the mechanisms through which most of these medications work and these genetic tests are quite new. Id imagine there is promise in ruling out some medications as likely to be ineffective. While we know height is quite hereditable weve found thousands of genes play a role in determining it. However we also know one gene has a large impact on who develops alzheimers.Given the rather unpredictable ways in which medication works in different individuals then even if it did work it would be hard to prove except in large scale high quality clinical trials. The little anecdote means nothing. It probably wouldnt be hard to find someone who picked a med as a result of the genetic test and it yielded a huge improvement. Hopefully this will be effective in  years time and substantially improve medication choices. But it seems most people would pay for it as a last hope rather than judging the science. ,bipolar,cvr0jg8,1,t5_2qnv4
5324036,0,t3_3nx8w6,Forgetfulness. Hand tremor. Teeth grinding. Lithium can cause at least two of these. Stress definitely causes all three and does so much more frequently and reliably. Ive been on Lithium for  years now. The way the side effects hit me are odd. I experienced cognitive impairment on and off for my second year on the drug and now its pretty much gone. I just started getting tremors in my hands this summer and they stopped about a month ago. Most of my problems every time were compounded by stress. Every psychiatrist is trained to give a simple verbal cognition test in order to check certain brain functions and some are willing to perform it over the phone. Even after that step if you can not or will not tolerate the effects of certain drugs which is perfectly reasonable for someone in your position talk to your psychiatrist about it. Maybe your body needs more time to adjust to your medicines.

Having said that I think that assuming for the sake of my comment that you do have bipolar once you are able to better manage your depression you will not feel as attached to the up symptoms because they wont be contrasted by such deep lows.If you leave hypomania unchecked and only treat the depression the hypomania can worsen and when it worsens it stops being fun or enjoyable.Regardless of your diagnosis I hope you get well.,bipolar,cvug53r,1,t5_2qnv4
5345271,0,t3_3o7odo,I get this a lot and when I try to describe it to the mental health professionals they say things like What are the thoughts youre having? or Whats stressing you out? and Im all like Well mostly I just want to stop feeling like I need to crawl out of my skin or my heart is going to jump out of my chest. Theyll have me sit there and go through some CBT cognitive behavior therapy or DBT dialectical behavior therapy process to unpack whats bothering me and then I leave still feeling jittery and sick.Sometimes I suspect that what Im experiencing may not be helpfullytermed anxiety but something else entirely  and I think this only because the therapy process doesnt seem to do anything to make it go away. Maybe there is some thought process going on thats so entrenched that I just cant access it yet. But what seems to help right now are the meds and physical strategies Ive been given to combat it. I dont like being tied to benzodiazepines but they lessen the feelings. I also do the following. Hot shower. Ice fists  squeeze ice cubes in my hands until the ice melts. Not the best feeling but better than the excruciating physical sensations.. Intense exercise if I can muster.. Deep breathing but this only works sometimes.. Strong or calming scents like lavender and coffee.. Wrapping myself up tight in a blanket like a human burrito and losing myself in some shitty TV on Netflix.. Oh and actual literal screaming. Like think primal scream.Ive noticed that the feelings come when Im on the verge of an episode or when I havent been sleeping well.

I used to work at disability services for a university and all we needed was a note on a prescription pad didnt even have to be a written letter stating that this person had a mental health disability. Of course every disability services will be different. Different disabilities require different accommodations. People with bipolar can be successful in school provided they receive accommodations that they need. Hell I eventually got my masters. So it is possible.Edited to add that I agree with getting some documentation from the doctor is probably the best step because doctors can be a pain to get into. But I would give Disability Services a call to find out what type of documentation is needed so that you can get the right documentation from your doctor.,bipolar,cw4i70w,3,t5_2qnv4

5522752,0,t1_cwh99zh,The hard part is that bipolar individuals get a large amount of the satisfaction from external motivation and validation.  Kinda sucks given the nature of what bipolar does to individuals but more than most people we typically hunger for the constant approval of others while feeling that we are a negative boon to them.  When you have those thoughts you seriously just need to sit back and tell yourself that its the depression talking and your family and friends actually care about you.  Even if your sister was being bitchy from reading your statement if that was close to her wording it sounds like she is simply an individual who doesnt understand mental illness very well and believes that the methods everyone takes in the everyday life should be sufficient for you if you try harder.  Why arent you trying harder?I get that but look at the other side of the fence here.  Your sister while bitchy probably cares about you and simply is expressing her concern that you may use the title of this diagnosis as an excuse to stop trying the everyday things you need to do to manage your emotions.Heres the shitty part  Shes right.  Its like this though shes right but for the wrong reasons.  She doesnt understand the illness and is just expecting you to magically run  days a week and be productive and perfect and youll be better!  Doesnt work like that for us.  Your sisters end logic is correct though because I have seen it over and over where someone is coping with the illness well enough goes in to a doctor to ask questions gets diagnosed and then thinks that because of that diagnosis they are now utterly done and useless.  Now you have been able to sustain your life just fine as a responsible adult with a few bumps but if you really are bipolar and made it this far I think youre a freaking rockstar.  You need to keep that confidence going in to meet this thing.  You can do this youve done it for years without knowing now all you have to do is start slowly implementing good habits one habit at a time and learning more about your disorder and how to control it to the highest extent.I thought it was hopeless until I came across a community of bipolar individuals here at home that are doctors lawyers firemen etc and it was just crazy to hear everything they have had to do to keep themselves healthy.  The consensus is this though  days of cardio a week im not joking is the best thing you can do make sure you are falling asleep at exactly the same time and waking up at exactly the same time every day I mean this and other stuff like that youll fine out as you research this.  Dont get mad at your family theyre the most important thing you have in supporting you through hard times which you WILL have.  If you can talk to your sister educate her once you have educated yourself and understand everything about this.  Find a group of people to talk about this issue with and keep up with it support groups  psychologist visits at least once every  weeks can help you when youre not doing well and if you keep up with it regularly then people will be able to tell how youre doing that day.Sorry for wordiness nature of the beast.  Again best of luck to you my friend.  ,bipolar,cwhkxll,2,t5_2qnv4

Haha Im such a nerd.Music has always been secondary to education though so I didnt do any music type classes in college so I could spend all my time focused important stuff. Instead I had my headphones full of music everywhere I went on campus. I also go to tons of music festivals and concerts now to supplement my love of music.I always have music on my mind. People talk about having songs stuck in their head? I always have something playing in my mind. Walking is always the worst for me too. The step of my feet walking or running ends up being the beat of some song. I even dream about music and wake up with random songs on my mind.I love it.

5602442,0,t3_3rshjb,If you want to force the issue you have a few options. . Convince your Pdoc to remit his statementsvery unlikely for liability reasons they probably will not just wash away the observations. . Change Pdocs and reevaluate. Get a different Doctor to write off the other Doctors reports as hogwash.. Plausible deniability. No medication no doctors visits give it time or say  years and refute that anything actually happened. What? Do they have video a court order can they read squibbling bullshit a doctor wrote down? Yeah no. It can go away on its own and you can take legal action to bar the hospital that forced the Dx from sharing the information. If however you intend to take a job that federally requires disclosure then you have to get it expunged from your medical record which could take  doctors a lawyer interviewing the staff etc etc a big fucking headache. You might as well spend your life getting fucked up at this point because they demonized your existence and its not even worth half the trouble when you can be written off as unstable with the stroke a pen.,bipolar,cwrjc5j,1,t5_2qnv4

Over a period of about  months I was steadily getting fewer and fewer hours of sleep the sleep I managed wasnt very restful either. Then came the secondguessing. Things people said looks people gave me what I thought to be others intentions even my own thinking was at times called into question. I dont know if Id say that I was paranoid but certainly I was suspicious of everyone and everything.To be sure I knew something was up that my interpretations and thought processes might be abnormal. But I didnt have a way to confirm that I was in fact delusional and soon it all became too real for me.Theres only so long you can go on  hrs. of sleep a night before you start hallucinating. It was mostly small things at first shadowy movements in the corner of my eye someone standing in a doorway staring at me my name being spoken over the loudspeaker at school whispers in a crowd a total loss of vision like the lights went out for  seconds. Then a doppelgnger started to follow me around town initially keeping his distance. Even at night I knew he was near. He wouldnt stop. I thought he was going to try to take over my life or something or just assume my identity and sabotage everything. He didnt though. The whole episode culminated with me witnessing his my suicide.

So I think that most memories you have from manic episodes will be good ones because you felt like you were on cloud  at the time. I was diagnosed a few years ago. I am  and have only had one manic episode which occurred immediately after I stopped taking antidepressants that my first psychiatrist prescribed to me. It turns out that he wrongly diagnosed me with severe depression even though thats a textbook misdiagnosis to look out for I didnt know at the time. Needless to say he no longer has a practice.I have one memory where I was at a bar talking to a group of people I had never met before. One of the girls was a bit drunk and she asked me to guess her name. I focused while our eyes locked for a few seconds and then her name popped into my head. It wasnt an obvious name and she didnt give me a first letter. Her name was Melanie and she was shocked... She even said I was psychic lol.I dont think I have special powers but that happened while I was manic. A lot of weird shit happened when I was manic. I think it was a pretty severe episode. People that dont have bipolar just dont understand what its like to be manic. The consensus is that its bad but Im just not sure how bad it is.I actually told my current psychiatrist that I want to slowly ween myself off the medication maybe but bipolar could be a life long condition. Hes worked with me to keep me on as little medication as possible which is nice. He was recommended by my doctor who is awesome. So I think that I am lucky. I actually trust this guy.

I didnt sleep much about  hoursnight and would go for long walks in the middle of the night. I raved about it to my friends saying this is the shit! But after about a week I started hallucinating and got really paranoid that someone was out to kill me. The doctor told me to stop the med and it took about  weeks for the hypomaniaparanoia to subside.My next AD was an SNRI Effexor and that sent me into a mixed episode. I could hardly sleep had so much energy I felt like I just wanted to jump out of my skin my mind raced and was so depressed I wanted to die all at the same time. Thats when I was diagnosed BP Mixed.

6072142,0,t3_3ynkr3,Ive struggled with having a balanced view about goal setting.  For a long time I set what I saw as some unreasonable goals although I was able to achieve some of them.  However the manic steam really does just burn out and youre left with the scraps at the end of the line...until you get manic again.Ive created a system for myself thats kept me in reasonable check between no goals and unreasonable goals.  I write down the goals for my  year  year and  year projected goals I want accomplished.  I let my manic phase go haywire and jot down all my goals.Then I create a mission statement something along the lines of a set of plans to accomplish those goals.  The mania may still be there and I might create some elaborate set of plans that seem reasonable.  Once my depressive episode kicks in I review my manic goals and cut off the two or three that I know I cant seem to do.  There will still be many goals on there that I dont think I can accomplish in my depressive state but I let my depressive mode cull out the really whacky possibilities.And regardless of whether Im down in the dumps or as high as a kite I read my goals to myself.  My barometer for reasonable goals comes from feeling connected to them even if Im low.  I read them and let them sink into me knowing that theres the part of me that believed I could do this.After a while my goals sort of average out into something that becomes meaningfully challenging but not impossible.  Ive been doing this for a long time even before my diagnosis so I think its worked out better than expected.

A few years ago I very nearly destroyed our relationship by fucking someone else. I was manic and in a very bad place and decided that I didnt need my husband anymore and I was going to be free and single and do what I wanted when I wanted damn it. I did the right thing and told my husband I was leaving him and then went out and had sex with someone else. It was shitty sex with a shitty person.

This resulted in tense work environment and stress as my bank account went into the negative incurred overdraft charges and I was behind on bills.Once I went back on the seroquel within a couple of weeks things didnt annoy me as much. I didnt feel the urge to overspend and life was generally less stressful.Since were all probably different in situation and body chemistry the only thing can reliably recommend is doing a daily journal.

6506141,0,t1_czrrflm,Thanks for the reply!To answer your question bipolar is a spectrum with stability in the middle hypomania above that and mania further above that. On the other side of stability is mild depression and severe depression below that. Bipolar  fluctuates between the depressions and swings up to hypomania but never swings all the way to mania. Bipolar  fluctuates between the depressions and swings to hypomania but also can swing all the way to mania. Thats how I understand it.,bipolar,czsa8e7,1,t5_2qnv4
6508038,0,t3_44rqj2,I never get full blown mania ive only ever been hypomanic. It never lasts for more than  days and it is always preceded and followed by  days to  weeks of deep depression. Sometimes I rapid cycle  days of hypo  days of depression rinse and repeat for a month or two. Other than that I get prolonged  month depressive episodes but Ive never had a prolonged hypomanic episode. The hypomania itself is fantastic it is like your body is producing and consuming its own adderall. I can concentrate and complete tasks in record time with minimal distractions I always want to be doing something productive and I cant shut the hell up. I just babble on to the person I share an office with all day long it is probably super distracting for them but  theyll put their headphones in if im becoming unbearable. For some reason even though I wont stop running my mouth I can still focus on my own work and get shit done. People who know me well and who can tell if im hypobaselinedepressed always comment about how I am funnier when Im hypo. My hypomanic experience has only been positive but that isnt necessarily a good thing because the depression that follows is always more bad than the hypomania was good if that makes any sense.,bipolar,czshb4t,1,t5_2qnv4
6510205,0,t3_44pufa,High functioning successful young adult here. Ive just moved to a new city and am still looking for the right job but previously I was diagnosed right in the middle of earning a M.S. I went on to finish in the top of my class and do some really amazing projects and jobs.The biggest tip I have is to keep going to regular therapy along with continuously taking your meds. You NEED that hour of time talking about your mental health because your student and professional lives care little or not at all about your internal wellbeing. Definitely discuss self care regularly with your therapist and make sure to request that she keeps tabs on whether or not you are keeping up with self care behaviors no matter how small they are. They really help you maintain a sense of control over stress levels. They also assist with healthy internal dialogue so its less dwelling and more goaloriented. Coping mechanisms are EVERYTHING. Wishing you much luck ,bipolar,czspean,2,t5_2qnv4

In my case Im pretty sure I had some severe narcissistic qualities and everything crumbled and I need to rebuild but with different building materials on a new foundation.The only advice I really have sympathetically is to not be preoccupied of how you are supposed to be and take the time to feel what youre feeling now. Maybe youre not as happy because you see differently and its terrifying. I wouldnt think of it as a real you that youre looking to uncover. These are all versions of you good and bad and all parts of you are evolving. Some will be left behind but ultimately you for the most part are in control especially with your perspective. What Im saying basically is to take this as an opportunity to grow. Based on the nature of the disorder youll come back up to another mood at some point so until then you can try to understand how you are feeling and allow yourself to process it without trying to stuff it down. No need to mourn what you were like  months ago. Either youll get back there or youll experience a new more knowledgable version of yourself. ,bipolar,d02ztbs,2,t5_2qnv4

I myself have identity issues with extremely low confidence that leads to isolation. This was something I have struggled with my entire life I am . It has taken me  years to finish an associates degree. I continued to force myself to take  classes online. Some semesters I took none but I am happy that I am here now. I know there is a huge stigma with younger people needing to get their life started so they can settle. But it takes a lot of time and hard work to go to school. Throw in mental illness and it suddenly feels impossible. I still hate talking about school to my family and friends and avoid it at all costs. And thats okay its good to keep distance to protect yourself.The best thing I recommend is to try to find a form of peace with yourself. Try to figure out something that makes you feel slightly better. Mine is to put two hours in my appearance which is exhausting then going out in public. It is weird but the most I isolate myself the worst I become. I also play video games big hobby of mine and talk to people on the internet. They are my rock and I feel like I can tell them everything.I would start there if socializing in person is too much for you. But I do recommend trying to figure out the main goals that are important to you. If you want to go to school do  to  classes online or at night to avoid big crowds. Its all about baby steps. All you have to do is keep moving even if it is slow.,bipolar,d0yd5ws,2,t5_2qnv4

Im in the process of reading it and for those with the disorder as well as those around them it reveals a lot about the dynamics of bipolar that people dont think of.Start from there. It contains a really handy mood charting guide  Basically every day you chart your mood from one to ten and you can even choose to do it by hour. At the end of the day you write a couple of sentences on what you did that day and how you feel as a result and over the course of weeks you can establish a baseline of mood and how changes can effect it. That helps identify triggers as well as techniques that can help the person deal with swings in mood or emotion.,bipolar,d10uj9x,1,t5_2qnv4

Playing music regularly helps me express all the intense emotions I feel.My dad pays his bills far in advance to keep the stress down. I know you dont like too much schedule but setting a specific day of the week to shop might help especially if you pick a less busy day.Also if you can afford to I think cutting back your hours at work could simplify things.

7047917,0,t3_4c1wcj,I was a psychiatric nurse for about  years before my own mental health issues forced me out of the profession. My personal experience is this much of psychiatric medicine is based on the patients subjective experience. We cant see someones hallucinations moods or their interactions with people outside the clinical setting. The only things that you have to work with most of the time is what the patient TELLS you and your intuitiontraining. If someone tells me theyre seeing a dragon I cant tell if they are wildly imaginative having a druginduced hallucination or suffering from a severe form of schizophrenia. Physical causes can sometimes be objectively identified an CAT scan shows the patient has a tumor effecting a part of the brain or a stroke etc. Although we are making some progress in this area...funcional MRI is starting to show some promise as a diagnostic tool for some psychiatric illnesses. Mainstream use is a bit far off right now. I guess my real point is that psychiatry is probably the most customtailored field of medicine there is hands down. It mostly IS a highlyeducated form of trial and error. In my case it took some dozen tries to find a combination of meds that effectively controlled my symptoms and had sideeffects that I could live with and I may have to undergo several more if down the road my condition changes or the medications are no longer effective. Its easy to see why so many patients become discouraged after sometimes years of medication regime changes and few results.,bipolar,d1f8mg0,2,t5_2qnv4

7088379,0,t3_4clsol,Ive been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at the age of . I first went to a psychiatrist at the age of  where they triggered one of my first full blow manic episodes by giving me an SSRI Lexapro without a mood stabilizer. Its determined that I did have Bipolar at this age and possibly around the age of  or so. I come from a very long line of relatives with Bipolar DisorderManic Depression so it wasnt so odd for me to have it at such a young age. I am still in my teens and my psychiatrist has told me that ADDADHD go hand in hand with Bipolar often  though its not been determined I have it we have looked into that factor. I suffered the same way that your son is suffering and my parents pulled me out of school and homeschooled me so that I attend school online when I was in middle school. Im not saying to do this Im just saying that bringing him to a psychiatrist may be a wise thing to do. My symptoms were severe depression mood swings elevated mood switching from subject so subject not being able to focus on anything having episodes where I would just be up and down. I felt pressure to talk and would have emotional meltdowns at the drop of a pin. I was just all over the map. I am still struggling with this but I am medicated. There is a very long symptom list. My manic episodes helped me get diagnosed as did my long my family history. EDIT I would like to add that my parents cooperation and openness with me as well as to my diagnosis were key in me getting the diagnosis and treatment that finally have me living normally. As well as changing psychiatrists and going to one that is extraordinary and really knows what hes doing and specializes in adolescents. ,bipolar,d1ju3is,2,t5_2qnv4

Those may be all the side effects I get.Sometimes I have trouble with proper nouns. Every once in a while no more than a few times a week. But not civilian trouble. I mean your gf says I love you Hour Falcon and youre all I love you to umbeautiful. Youre so beautiful did I ever say? and then you check your phone to see her name. I also have an issue like when you walk into a room and cant remember why you wanted to come there or what you wanted to get. Only its a thought that begins like normal and then I forget what the hell I was thinking about or doing. Oh right Im writing this paper here... Thats a daily experience.I know the name thing is typical of lithium but given my experience with these meds I would point the finger at Seroquel which also very forcibly regulates my sleep schedule. However now that Im used to it I am not sleepy and fumbling through a haze of confusion like in the first weeks. Maybe its just because Ive been on all these for a while? Some times I get all a mess in a brain fog and tired but then it usually helps to take a walk or especially to drink some water. To give some perspective on what a lithium user can do Im a PhD candidate and though Im having serious difficulties because of mood episodes everyone agrees that Im smart and capable and I get good feedback both on intellectual stuff I do and boring repetitive stuff that requires  thought and focus. Before you say Wow youre crazy lucky with side effects! Noone has it like you! let me say maybe youre right but consider this. The people who have the strongest motivation to post on threads like these are those who experience sideeffects so you wont get a real sample. And look up the incidence of these different side effects. You might think Seroquel gives everyone a headache but really its only about  if I remember right.

Take it every day take it as prescribed dont worry if youre a little dizzy and give it time to work. You may start feeling better immediately thats the placebo effect. Its hope and relief and a feeling of accomplishment for taking the step.

If youre suddenly motivated yet still super anxiousdepressed it can be a very bad situation. Keep an eye on your moods and try to really choose your choices.

That rule is Always check your labels and ingredients. Know what you are consuming. Anything you cannot pronounce I can guarantee you probably dont want to be putting that into your body. With that stay away from processed sugars high fructose corn syrup artificial flavors artificial sweeteners and if you can  nonnatural preservatives. I usually try to buy products with labels such as all natural ingredients organic and nongmo. Apart from that I am a huge fan of fresh fruit and veggies dont be wasting your money on canned shit. Also granola and granola bars probably the Hill Valley brand I think is what it is. Kind bars are also pretty damn tasty. I also love to snack on cereal but I eat the chex cereal because its gluten free and doesnt contain much processed ingredients you should definitely consider giving up dairy milk and using almond or coconut or hemp milk. I hope this helps Im sorry I havent given you a list of things but healthy eating is so subjective that I think a serious point in the right direction will be much more helpful.

7494524,0,t3_4i0t4x,Two separate issues here.  The violent thoughts and urges and telling HR.First as far as telling HR I dont think that is wise.  They might be required to pull you out of work because they believe having you there is an employee safety risk.Second as far as the thoughts and urges themselves this is something you need to do some soul searching.  When Im not stable I regularly deal with violent thoughts and urges.  It sucks.  It sucks more that some people within the bipolar community want to pretend that violence and mental illness have absolutely no relationship.  Well they do and we need to be responsible and own up to it when we might act on these thoughts and urges.  If you think you are going to act out on these you probably need hospitalization.  Yes you are broke but if you do act out on these urges you will probably be more broke.  Out of a job in jail all that stuff.  It may not matter who throws the first punch.  You may wind up injured.  Perhaps severely.  Are you working with a therapist and pdoc?  I would contact them.  If you trust your therapist with this sort of stuff talk about it.  Maybe your pdoc can suggest a medication change to help with irritability if that is at the root of this.Take care of yourself.  Be honest with yourself.  Violence wont end well for anyone involved.,bipolar,d2u35tx,4,t5_2qnv4

You are responsible for seeking treatment practicing self care making an effort etc. You arent responsible for your mistakes in pursuing care and youre not responsible for failuresactions taken when your efforts dont prove to be enough. The lack of remorse could be a number of things and I understand it being the most troubling aspect. I strongly suggest therapy. If youre already seeing one maybe switch it up and try another. This is obviously affecting your daily life. It could possibly massively improve your quality of life expand your understanding and selfawareness.,bipolar,d2u4kpo,1,t5_2qnv4

7692047,0,t1_d3gdxrg,I had them done this past Thursday so four days ago. They said it would just take a couple days but I dont know if they work on the weekends. haha It was late Thursday like pm. The place I went and got it done was really weird. It was like bright green and the receptionist didnt smile at all. It was a funny contrast.Yeah. I have been doing a lot of research. Online and I bought three books. I was really surprised because I didnt really know anything about bipolar. When I read through the symptoms it makes sense but on the other hand I have really loud doubts like I must have said something wrong to give them the wrong idea or something. Plus Ive been reading all these statistics and since theyve told me Ive heard people I know mention bipolar in a very negative light three separate times and the whole thing is just making me really uneasy. Then on the other hand if theyre right Im glad its something that I can take medicine for because whatever is wrong with me makes me feel crazy unstable and I cant stand being inside my head. Then I worry if theyre wrong will the wrong meds mess up my brain more. I dont know. Again probably all concerns I need to bring up with my doctor. Ill write it down. I see him in four and a half hours anyway.One of my friends from high school is bipolar and shes always been one of my most favorite people so that made me feel a little better.

They are professionals whom will assess what help you may need and arrange transport to a hospital if that is the course of action to be taken.I dont know what your country may offer by try to find a similar resource. If you cannot I still recommend the hospital. This may be tolerable  in its current form  but unchecked may get worse.In the end you sound lucid enough to make the decision yourself.

Also like god and archangels and how divine communication would work and how i can access it. But then when you come out of it thinking everything would have changed by then i find out the world is still the same and people are all still just people.

7939507,0,t3_4nzme4,Remember that youre not looking for a support person youre looking for a friend who can sit there with you while you deal with your stuff. Im gonna say right now that good friends are hard to find and easy to burn out. Making friends is hard and theres always gonna be rejection or hurt feelings in the process at some point. And you gotta figure out how to balance receiving the support you need with giving good things into the friendships.I use a combination of OKCupid and making sure people invite me out so I can steal their friends. Parties are great for it if you can handle it sometimes I cant and youre lucky enough to have good people in your life who collect similarly good friends. Some people are also bullshit or dont have the capacity for sitting with mental illness and being supportive.And honestly in the absence of the support from decent internet people or people in my friend group which totally happens I just look for the nearest person whos super into board games or tabletop RPGs and start playing games with them and usually someone rad shows up.Spreading the supportive relationships out over groups of folks is awesome.A church community who can be actually supportive is probably a really good idea I dont do the whole Christian thing so its out for me but queer folks are all in the same boat when it comes to lacking a cohesive community so its easier to find accepting and supportive friend groups.,bipolar,d48h49z,2,t5_2qnv4

The other big on was that the world was an alternate reality where parents nurtured younger people and could change the body easy or transfer consciousness to another body where the other experiences lived and informed that person in their subconscious. I thought there was a man in the bushes listening to me call the pdoc even though I couldnt see him. I though Jackson from My Cat from Hell had been secretly training my cat so she would get along with my parents cat. I thought I had a big idea for a fabulous app and brainstorming IRL that would make me world renowned no coding experience and not know any software people. I thought the sink in my hospital room gave calming meds and the water fountain outside the room would hype me up.

You have a solid plan for the future and you need help getting there no problem with that. Not all of us are so lucky that we can have some financial support and a home with supporting family so we are both very fortunate in that sense. So many people with mental health illnesses end up on the street and that leads to further problems as they lack support and often turn to illegal drugs to get through the day causing further problems mentally physically and financially. I always think about that when I am down about my situation it could be worse.

It would explain my behavior in the past few years having bolstering overconfidence and feelings of immortality followed by depressive episodes and meltdowns triggered by stress and repeat. Over the past few days Ive been pushed to the fringe in terms of mood swings and triggering news events. My emotions continue to fluctuate and its been preventing me from accomplishing my internship I know for a fact that something isnt normal.So I want to get help and also a evaluationdiagnosis. I am about to become a college sophomore in the end of August but the earliest appointment I can make with my GP would be in SeptemberOctober and it would be my first meeting with her. I am considering asking her for a referral but I am not sure of how long I could last until then? Some of the notable places in my area are not currently accpeting patients and I dont believe that my current insurance covers behavioral health directly. I wouldnt say that I am in danger of harming myself or others despite the ideations I have but I fear that I may do something stupid and fuck up what I have going for me right now. Its an odd uncertain waiting game.My apologies for the jumble.

On to your diagnosis I think thats a fairly common progression as most initially present with chronic depression which is usually the initial diagnosis but then they feel good maybe too good NOS and if the cycle continues they eventually get a type  diagnosis only because they havent had a full documented manic episode key word documented doesnt mean it hasnt occurred. I cant comment on the PTSD obviously but any diagnosis is overwhelming at first but it can also be a relief too.  Type  and type  are actually quite different in terms of diagnosis it just takes time yearsdecades to gather the information to make the proper one. Treatment can be much more efficient with the right diagnosis albeit its never an easy road.   ,bipolar,d54zk3m,5,t5_2qnv4

Ive had my school use as evidence against me when I reported being sexually assaulted. Ive been called the crazy exgirlfriend a LOT. Ive been called crazy a lot in general. Im starting to really hate that word and I try not to use it anymore.Those people arent in my life anymore. I have friends who understand a boyfriend who understands and theyre able to recognize when Im having a tough time.

If she seriously wont let it go tell her youd be willing to do an evaluation at an addiction treatment center. The people at Hazeldon Betty Ford are really nice.Youll go in there for an hour and theyll ask you questions about your drug use do a UA and then the counselor decides whether or not they think you could benefit from addiction treatment and what kind of treatment you need and they offer it to you all voluntary. If you dont need treatment they say youre good see ya. Sounds like you dont use drugs that much so you should have no issues and you can grab the counselors notes on your way out if your mom wants to see them.That should get her to shut up.My mom and dad are super supportive of me do not deny my diagnosis and support my treatment decisions. However theres a lot of things they believe and say that piss me off because they just dont get it.I lost my job and I was having a hard time a few weeks ago  my mom said something to the effect of oh.

8459069,0,t3_4vjmqu,Well for me mania is can usually be simplified down to a lot of energy and emotions whether bad or good. My best trick is to have an outlet. Sometimes for the energy that means swimming or running laps or cleaning. For the emotions side of it I sometimes write poetry or listen to music that fits my feelings. If Im too unfocused and just kind of exploding my favorite thing to do is get a blank sheet of paper or canvas and some paint particularly red and just go at the canvas with a paintbrush with slashing marks. Ive actually made some decent art that way. Staying in well lit areas around people I trust helps with the psychosis. Basically channeling whatever is going on into something healthy rather than unhealthy. But thats just short term coping skills. Therapy and sometimes medication are what really help me. Being able to talk about it works wonders. Thats what has helped me through them anyways but Im still very much in the learning process. Wishing you both luck!,bipolar,d5yx2ep,2,t5_2qnv4

One way to do it is to take classes as a continuing education student or a graduate student at large.  Different colleges have different names for it  but all I mean is you can take some classes without being accepted into a degreegranting program. You take classes  la carte if you get my meaning. Thats how I got into graduate school. I took classes  la carte and found a professor I really liked. I took a few courses from him and then when it came time to apply I had him write a letter of recommendation. So he was recommending me to his school  himself essentially.

Because other people arent appreciating you for what youre able to offer?One thing Ive had to learn is that I need to stop caring about the opinions of people who dont know what Im dealing with. And if youd asked me several years ago if this is the life I would have wanted to have I would have flat out told you fuck no.Im guessing youre relatively new to the diagnosis. But heres one thing about human nature  once we are exposed to a certain thing after a while we learn to like it. We learn to let go of the idea of how we thought things were going to be and appreciate them for the way they ended up.This wasnt who I thought I would be. But its who I am. And fuck Ive learned to take pride in what I do to survive on a daily basis.Im sorry this is so hard for you. Change is difficult as is letting go of what could have been if only things were different. It is without a doubt the hardest thing Ive ever had to deal with in my life and in all truth the hardest thing I will ever have to deal with.But thats life. We cant take the things we start off with for granted. They can be taken away from us in an instant. And yeah this stuff definitely does not happen to everyone  its completely fucking unfair. But what doesnt kill us only makes us stronger. The biggest gift Ive found with this is that Im able to relate to more people even if they arent able to relate to me in return.Hang in there.

8624759,0,t3_4xz9vl,Please can I suggest dont act on this yet. By all means get a dedicated notebook and write and plan all of this in it. But dont act yet. The reason I say this is this sounds a hell of a lot like a hypomanic state. It sometimes comes through as an intense religious experience. Am I saying this isnt real or meaningful? Not at all. I guess a good analogy is that the illness turns up the volume on a great idea so that you hear it louder than you normally would. But the clue for me is in the sense of urgency the desire to save the world and crucially youre thinking of taking a risk...ie switching your degree. Thie sudden onset is a big red flag.Please let me repeat I am not saying your ideas and plans arent meaningful.I am certainly not qualified to say if God speaks or not. Your relationship with God is a deeply personal thing. But if these plans are not hypomanic then they will stand the test of time and your planning notebook will be waiting for you.

I dont have any issues with substance abuse so my psych is fine prescribing them actually he always tells me to use them more than I currently do as life is still quite a struggle for me. Less of one as time goes on though. I consider them to be useful tools. He says that his other patients will often take them every day whether they need them or not because they start fearing fear basically. Whereas for me I just dont want my anxiety to get in the way of being functional. I expect it to be there in the back of my brain usually which will lessen over time too but when I need things to happen and I need to be clearheaded and rational and sociable and outgoing and stuff I take my Xanax. I do have to work on longterm anxiety but the shortterm is going well. Ativan helps a lot with my bipolar irritability and my sensory agitation and my anxiety meltdowns.

8747737,0,t3_4zpz7i,I really like appreciate this. Before I was diagnosed I didnt think anything was really wrong with me. I mean sometimes I would feel so low my whole body was heavy and I physically couldnt make facial expressions or get out of bed it felt like someone poured concrete into my cells. Then other times I was so good I was cleaning the house to perfection making great meals able to keep up with friends I felt like I finally moved fast enough to get things in my life done. I thought I was just really balanced and everyone had low and high points sometimes the lows felt endless and sometimes the highs made me feel like I wanted to pop out of my skin but everyone has high and low points. I thought being young meant I would make stupid decisions and abuse drugs and my sexual impulses would be hard to control because every young person has impulse control issues and likes drugs.It wasnt until someone close to me pointed out I was out of control with everything that I got help and diagnosed. Im still trying to get all my meds straightened out by this point. I never wanted to be bipolar it wasnt even in my mind I rationalized everything to the point where serious poly substance abuse was in my mind a normal way of getting through the day. Now Ive noticed it really does bother me when people say things like shes so bipolar on her period or yeah sometimes I just snap Im so bipolar or just having the general idea that bipolar is something as minor as moodiness or inappropriate quick reactions. Its a daily fucking struggle. I honestly dont know if a diagnosis has helped me because even though I was coping with drug abuse it was comforting to feel like everyone went through the motions. ,bipolar,d6z4e5a,1,t5_2qnv4

8827264,0,t3_5131ax,Im . I would say that getting older has affected my symptoms in that many of the issues I had due to several traumatic events during my teen years dont affect me as severely. This is mostly because my perceptions have shifted and I have a lot of distance between myself and the things that caused me so much pain. Now my symptoms arent so much aggravated by my past as they are the every day stressors of life and because of this I do spend more time in bipolar remission. I have a  year old and parenting is really hard when Im sick. I have been cycling up and down frequently the last three months because I had to put my  year old cat to sleep so that has been rough. My hypomania isnt as pronounced even though I am on minimal medication. I have learned some coping skills which actually help to keep me from shooting up as high as I used to. My depression is probably somewhat improved though its hard for me to say because it feels pretty crippling at times. I have fewer periods of depersonalization. My generalized anxiety social anxiety and phobia of drivingriding in cars is getting worse as I age though and are hardly being controlled with medication at all because I have a crappy primary care doctor and cant afford a psychiatrist.   ,bipolar,d78wxt4,9,t5_2qnv4

Bipolar only seems big and scary because society in general is taught that this diagnosis is reserved for some of the craziest people out there. Its just not true. And unfortunately.. that means we are forced to educate ourselves outside of webMD. It means we have to go through trial and error of different medications until we think we sort of feel normal again. Its overwhelming and I can  say I lost touch of who I was for about a year. It gets better with time. The worst was that I felt so alone. I had people around me.. but I couldnt explain what was happening and they couldnt understand. My best advice is to have patience. Be compassionate. I couldnt imagine dealing with it all while still in college because school is stressful enough on its own. Yeah your friend might not be themselves for a little while until they figure it all out on their own. I would maybe avoid pointing out everything thats different and just sort of quietly observe. Its important to step in when you think they might be getting too unhealthy and impulsive.. for instance excess drinking drugs promiscuity anything risking their own safety.. at least outside of their normal behaviors. Or if their school work is becoming compromised.. and then of course any severe depression talk.. thats the type of stuff that their doctor should be aware of. If you dont feel comfortable discussing with your friend because they get angry.. thats when I would honestly go to their mom. You dont have to share details if you dont want to.. but she should know if things seem to be getting worse instead of better. I would hate to see your friend have to drop out of college or something else that changes the course of their life just because they cant completely understand whats going on with them. good luck! i hope things get better.,bipolar,d7jmedb,2,t5_2qnv4

8932543,0,t3_52i3yv,Yes. I almost typed no but I realized I went through this period when I failed out of college sometime last year. Duh.I went off my medication also. I was on Zyprexa olanzapine and it stopped working as well for me plus I gained weight from it so I went off. Two or three months of horrible withdrawals a new tattoo a bad relationship lots of alcohol and one mixed episode later I failed out of college and couldnt get out of bed. Yes my self esteem was in the shitter. My mother dragged me screaming and crying out of my apartment saying I was never gonna live alone again and shit like that. The only thing you can do its to be there for her and try to convince her to take her meds. Do you know why shes quit taking them?

8959197,0,t3_52zqqs,I agree completely that rumination significantly affects daytoday quality of life. Right there with you unfortunately.All of the nonmed strats I have tried include some form of letting the thoughts sit instead of pushing them away. My therapist told me to clap once loudly when they happen when not in public as it associates the thought with a noise instead of something else. It doesnt really help though so not sure that is good advice. I would basically be clapping all the time. I think there may be intensive CBT workbook style stuff that can help with it and I have considered looking into DBTstyle mindfulness exercises to be more in the moment instead of within the rumination. I associate sunsets with a specific negative though and my favorite manga property with another. The list goes on and on like I cant let myself enjoy anything at all because of regrets and guilt. I tell myself wouldnt it be awful if this gets ruined with rumination too? Then it happens. Next time I see my psych I am going to ask her about Luvox but it seems like you may have already tried that. Sorry I dont have more concrete advice. ,bipolar,d7orexl,2,t5_2qnv4

What a strong bond it is between us and how she feels connected while kissing dizzy and stuff. That her love to me has gone to a whole different level. She knew she was really in love and she knows we will stay forever together how lucky she is to have the best person in the world and who is loving her back with his all.THESE things dont end up. How can after  months she in normal state say she doesnt feel love.Also I suspect the SSRI having the side effects of making her feel this way.,bipolar,d7oyuzb,1,t5_2qnv4

I still have trouble with word recall and my shortterm memory is spotty. After about a year of slow improvement it all plateaued and then became an issue of just accepting what I am now. I was able to get back into my professional field and am even contemplating higher education.Interestingly my fine motor skills and balance took a big hit. Its not a side effect you see in the literature but I notice it in playing video games. I was never very good at them but I used to be passable. Now quick twitch games like first person shooters are beyond my abilities entirely. I mostly stick to turnbased and noncombat adventure games with an occasional button masher. I love rpgs and XCOM so life could be worse.The memories are never coming back. My pdoc confirmed it to me when I started to see him again after the treatments. Theres a lot of stuff I am better off not remembering if I choose to believe my family and friends so its a mixed bag as well. I forgot my third marriage entirely! Take that Jillian!!!How about you?

Perhaps lowering the Lamictal dose and stacking it with Latuda would help you retain some or maybe mostall! of Lamictals benefits while reducing the cognitive sideeffects.Coming off of Lamictal would likely cause some withdrawal symptoms although the slower you do it the easier itd be to deal wtih Im guessing.

9309297,0,t1_d8vybb3,If you are referring to cardio for HIIT it does not build muscle. Caloric surplus with IMO and ideally heavy lifting builds muscle. Also eating clean will not dictate weight loss and I personally have to eat high carb because high fat makes me hungry and fucks with my blood sugar which was permanently affected by IF and Latuda at the higher doses I tried. Plus nuts are high calorie so thats not really the best suggestion for someone trying to lose weight. Plus from my own experience with eating clean its not often the most sustainable diet. Not only is it heavily restrictive with regards to what can be eaten which could easily lead to disordered eating andor an unhealthy relationship with food and for some this can then lead to binging on forbidden food but that also means that it can be a socialization killer and doesnt really teach someone how much they should be eating to lose or maintain weight ifwhen they discontinue this type of diet. Honestly the best way to go about things is to eat a diet that you know will be sustainable for life because it will be the easiest way to figure out how to change your caloric intake and thus portions based on changes in weight and activity levels. And clean eating is so arbitrary that there is no way for someone to truly know whether they are eating clean. For one person they may not consider dairy to be clean but someone else is fine with it. Or juices or apple sauce anything. ETA looking at that thread the weight training is not at all appealing to me. Doing body weight exercises will only work for so long especially because it will eventually result in the individual basically feeling no exertion from doing it. Much like when I stopped doing any cardio still lifted weighs heavily which gave me a really good cardio workout as well and then tried doing MISS again I struggled with resistance that in the past was much easier. So eventually you get accustomed unless you continue to increase resistance etc and thats pretty well impossible with strictly body weight. You need to add weight over time to continue pushing yourself and getting a proper work out from it. OP would benefit way more from starting a basic x a week beginner full body heavy lifting routine eating at a moderate deficit and eating enough protein to help retain lean body mass even if his goal is not to get ripped. Hed probably be much happier with the end result if incorporating lifting than if not because Ive never met anyone who wanted to lose weight with the intention of winding up skinny fat. I lost weight years ago and ended up skinny fat despite using the crappy weight machines at the gym. This time around I tracked calories ate enough protein lifted heavy currently squatting upwards of lbs above body weight and am leaner than I was back then despite being the same weight. Heavy lifting is basically the most amazing thing anyone could do when trying to lose weight.,bipolar,d8w0rzp,1,t5_2qnv4

9425389,0,t3_59n9vf,I love my story. I was in a manic phase it was a long one with a lot of promiscuity and thievery and compulsions. He found me on MySpace and after a month of talking invited me to his house for a movie. He had a cold so I brought a can of soup and didnt even heat it up. Lets face it I was planning on getting laid and that would probably be that. I ended up spending the night and we watched Star Trek Wrath of Khan first brush with real sci fi I had ever had and then the next day I watched him play video games all day. The next weekend we spent together and Sunday night after I went home he checked himself into a hospital for hallucinations visual and auditory. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and I felt like just bailing on him because he had a diagnosis of some kind. This was before I was diagnosed with anything I just thought I was generally fucked up. In the ensuing months he was kicked out of his house had to move in with his terrible birth parents who he didnt have any contact with at the time off and on all kinds of anti psychotics...it was a really hectic year and I didnt know what I was doing. I just knew that a I was emotionally dependent and desperate for someone to love me and b I really liked this guy a lot! He went on disability things settled and were now  years on. Since then Ive been diagnosed with bipolar gone through ridiculous med changes and have also gone on disability so now we live the life of two something octogenarians.

For instance if I only had a  and  point scale I could only feel a  or  it doesnt leave room for anything in the middle. So  is what I use. You can use as high a number as you want so long as you are able to figure out the different between  and .I track mine in google sheets and record  number for the day. It can be difficult when my mood is all over the place but generally  number for the day works pretty well. I calculate my results in SPSS which is a statistics software although I do my graphs in excel. Excel is nice because it gives you a moving average as you can in my graphs here its the red lineso that takes an average of a  day period and moves it along. So day  averages to  data point. Days  averages to the next data point and so on. It helps makes sense of the overall pattern when things look really hectic. Here is what my sheet looks like Its not something that would work for most people but it works for me I need that much control over my variables and I need them in excel so I can export them to SPSS,bipolar,d9d9oml,2,t5_2qnv4

9458109,0,t3_5a9ng6,Im sure lots of us can relate to your mood changes and how youve felt. But if there is also one thing we have in common is that we need medication. Sure weed might be medication but it only deals with part of the problem like stress or not feeling so bad when depressed but rather for bipolar disorder theres no one medicine fix you need multiple a mix of mood stabilizer antipsychotic antidepressant but the only way to find out which combination is best is with a psychiatrist. I always recommend going to a psych and being completely honest although in your case Id say do that as soon as you clear up your legal situation. If worse comes to worse and you are going to get jail time you might as well try to appeal with your disability. ,bipolar,d9evsbf,1,t5_2qnv4

9495484,0,t1_d9j6bjr,My mom thinks my episode actually started as far back as May or even February of this year.  It got really unpleasant and irrational in June and July to the point at which in the end of July I was taken in by the police to the psych ward.  So to answer your question it started with just acting a little bit odd and then just got worse and worse.  Eventually at the end of July I was hospitalized and the doctor in the hospital changed my medications and I came out of the irrational thinking manic episode and now I am acting normal again.  This was only my nd episode ever I am  yrs old my first episode was when I was age  when I was diagnosed.  I attribute this most recent episode due to stress from work and school.  I simply cannot handle a full time job or full time school and stress from those things in addition to refinancing our home and relationship issues were too much for me.  In the future I plan to be more proactive at stress reduction and if I go back to work only part time at the most.However as to your ex I cant say how long it will take him to stabilize.  Does he drink alcohol?  That can contribute to instability and psychiatric problems.  If he does not he is much more likely to be stable.  Same goes for any nonprescription drugs including marijuana.  I abstain from alcohol and marijuana I think that has helped me to regain my stability.  He will also need to follow a regular sleep schedule and see a psychiatrist regularly and also a therapist.I am so lucky that I am still in contact with my boyfriend as I am aware of how frightening and disruptive bipolar can be.  I dont blame you for breaking up with him my boyfriend told me directly that I have to make my health my first priority and if I am not maintaining my health he does not want to be around me.  So I am living with my mom now and he lives alone but my health is improving and I see him during the day.You could say the same thing to your ex that he needs to make his health his first priority and you will only see him if you see improvements in his health.  Im not going to tell you that you should have a relationship with your ex because I want whats best for you and if he has big problems then I dont want to encourage that.  However bipolar people such as myself are capable of real love and they are also capable of loyalty.  However they just have a lot of limitations.  If you love him and it can be easy to love a bipolar because they are funny creative good looking sexy and interesting anyways if you love him I suggest reading some books about bipolar for example Loving someone with bipolar disorder by julie fast.,bipolar,d9jirqi,1,t5_2qnv4

9529767,0,t3_5bdip8,I think therapy might be a better option especially with finding strategies to help deal with these emotions that youre feeling than trying to induce anhedonia.There was a time about this time two years ago that I wanted to desperately disconnect from my emotions. I even remember breaking down to my mum about how thats all I wanted. About a month later I experienced anhedonia. It was horrific sometimes worse than the mass of emotions Id felt before.Id sit in  hour classes and do jack shit. All Id do is spin around in my chair or try to sleep all because I didnt feel a thing. Did this lack of feeling help me to rise above what I was feeling? Not one bit. It got to the point where Id overdose just to feel something even if that something was uncontrollable vomiting or organ failure that something that I was originally trying to run away from.If anything it helped more to feel the mass of emotions and understand why I was feeling the way I was to try and deal with them head on with support.So when you next doctor voice how you feel you wanting to not feel anything see what they suggest and see if they think therapy is a better solution. All the best P.S. If you want to someone now feel free to PM me  As the band JAWS said Youll be alright it takes time.

The latest reason for isolation is that I moved to the USA from the UK to marry my wife I do have her at least for which I am grateful every day!. I never had to drive in the UK so I dont know how which isolates me a lot in a suburban New Jersey town. And of course the few friends I did have as well as my mum and brother are back in the UK.I keep meaning to try to make some new acquaintances here by joining a social group or something but my head never seems to be in the right place.

The only thing that makes me feel better is shopping but it doesnt last. Everyone always talks about how there isnt enough time in the day. I feel like there is way too much time I am always trying to figure out how to kill. My boredom causes anxiety I cant sit still but have no interest in doing anything.

9621444,0,t1_d9yyw27,Hmmm...good point although I didnt call you specifically a pawn. That could have been worded a lot better but Im not going to go back and edit it now I need to own my words you know? So that was a cheap shot Ill admit it. Not cool on my part.I think you and I probably agree on a lot more than we disagree about. Based on the evidence I do believe that its more dangerous for example to be black these days but probably not for the reasons you do. You only need to look at the blackonblack murder rate in places like Chicago to understand that yeah its dangerous especially to be a young black male. I do find it distressing that no one save a few people who are immediately branded racists are willing to discuss that. The conversation is about police officers killing black males but that rate pales in comparison to just one weekend in Chicago.Dangerous to be a Muslim? Naaa. Its the same thing  theyre much more likely to kill one another than some racist white stereotype of an American male is. If anything Muslims have become one of the most protected classes in the US. And thats as it should be. But I dont agree that its becoming more dangerous to be a Muslim in the US. Around the world? With ISIS Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations its much more dangerous to be a Muslim almost anywhere else but here. And a President Trump is not going to suddenly change that. The reason that its safer for Muslims to be in Western countries is that acceptance and tolerance are who we are especially in comparison with the extremists of our time. Now you want to see a Muslim that I AM afraid for? Women and homosexuals in Sharialaw countries and regions. Not a Muslim who has settled in the West for sure.Getting more dangerous to be Jewish? In what way Im curious? I havent detected that at all. If anything Jewish people are generally perceived as being successful familyoriented communitydriven smart and talented. Is it dangerous to be perceived that way? Ive not seen it.On the wave of hate crimes  I have to ask if Im being intellectually honest how many of those are legitimate? Ive already seen at least five or six examples Id have to dig through the news to find them of people faking hate crimes for a reason thats probably only fathomable to themselves. Ive actually seen more examples of violence and intolerance toward Trump voters than racial ethnic or religious minorities in the last few days. To say nothing of the rioters breaking things and burning things down because their candidate didnt get elected.I wish you peace in all of this. I actually feel bad that you seem so ill at ease simply with the results of an American election. I hope that you can find some solace and hopefully when none of the horrible potentialities materialize you can get past some of that anxiety.,bipolar,d9z1hhu,1,t5_2qnv4

Its good that you told him though. On a side note when I was first diagnosed with BP I went through kind of similar thing with my ex. Wed been talking about moving in together he even mentioned marriage and I didnt really want to. For about  months I had the biggest thing for my cousins best friend who we would party with regularly. I almost kissed my cousins best friend one time at a party while my ex was asleep. The feelings never went away. Finally when I was drinking with my cousin one night I hit up his friend. We ended up having sex that night and I kept hooking up with him BUT was still with my ex. I told him I wanted some time apart and that I was having second thoughts and I wouldnt even kiss him.i tried to break up with him but couldnt.  Finally he figured it out and broke up with me and was broken. I felt awful I wish I told him ASAP. But of course I didnt. I am a terrible person for what I did and he never deserved that and if I could go back and change things I would have broken up with him as soon as I started having feelings for this other guy. But whatever. I didnt. But after we broke up all my friends and family told me how they didnt trust him. And now Ive been dating my cousins best friend for . years and living together for a year. Our relationship is insane lam happier than I could ever imagine when Im not depressed obv and am so close with his family. Im not saying what you or I did was right but sometimes our heart knows what we need more than our brain. Sorry I went off on a tangent. Moral of the story is make sure things are over with the two of you and move along. Seems like the relationship was over awhile ago. Good luck! ,bipolar,da0uj3e,1,t5_2qnv4

Stripping naked and running around the ER in front of my parents was another personal low. Remember you do not have to disclose your diagnosis to everyone affected. Talk to your professors just say you were sick and can get a doctors note excusing you for those three weeks. Be aware after a high many people experience a low so get back in touch with your pdoc so you can get meds adjusted and maybe avoid that. Friends...my close friends I normally tell I have bipolar but I dont tell anyone at work. If your friends know your diagnosis and you hurt them somehow apologize and take responsibility. Say you were manic but feel thats no excuse and are doing your best to stay healthy and avoid mania in the future. For friends who dont know your diagnosis just tell them you were having personal difficulties and apologize if you did anything untoward. As for personal responsibility I believe I have an obligation to do everything in my power to stay free of episodes including taking my meds and getting regular sleep. I also got to a therapist every  weeks so she can monitor and tell me if Im getting manic. If you do drugs refuse to take meds and refuse to try and live healthy then in my opinion you are flirting with disaster. Also if Im hurting people and have truly lost control then my family knows my ass belongs in the hospital. Mania is never an excuse for physical or verbal abuse. If Im that bad then I need to be involuntarily committed . ,bipolar,da7hkje,5,t5_2qnv4

I also feel like I can tell what they are thinking based on what time the clock says certain numbers mean different things.

Seroquel did nothing and I had a lot of tremor and I was too sleepy to drive. Invega did nothing but had interesting dry orgasms no mess!.  Haldol and Rispiridal were EPS city even with benztropine.  I could not pee for  days on Zyprexa.  I took Seroquel Latuda Invega and Abilify long enough for my psychologist to consider them ineffective.Antidepressants  Zoloft Lexapro Celexa Cymbalta WelbutrinAntidepressants besides welbutrin all induced psychotic mania and some gave way to rapid cycling.  Plus the whole hypersexuality combined crippling impotence thing.  I will not take them anymore.There are more that I cant remember and I have NO idea what I was taking last time I was in the hospital but it induced the most intense paranoid psychotic break Ive ever had.  I think the only other BP approved antipsychotic is Thorazine which is rarely used.  I have an open invitation to Ketamine Clozapine and ECT when I start another episode.,bipolar,db8tzte,2,t5_2qnv4

10196985,0,t3_5m0n7t,Yes. Weed is a depressant. Those with mental illness are more susceptible to the negative affects of drugs than those without them  so yes the weed is most likely adding to your depression and you should seriously considering consider stopping.  Additionally the lithium probably did help but you cant just simply increase the dose. Lithium requires careful monitoring to stay in a therapeutic range and not reach toxic levels. You cant balance out the effect of the weed by adding more lithium. Your best course of treatment is going to be to abstain from the weed and alcohol if you are drinking and take the appropriate dose of lithium with consistent monitoring from a medical professional. ,bipolar,dbzvuvg,8,t5_2qnv4

10367960,0,t1_dcj9hlm,I think CPTSD is a much more useful diagnosis too but it requires there to have been trauma which is very common in BPD but not a specific qualifier so isnt helpful for everyone. I have been given both diagnoses at various times and definitely prefer CPTSD as a label despite the feeling of guilt that comes with having that dx without having endured say torture or imprisonment.Also really agree that BPD is a dumb name and means nothing. Theres always talk about renaming it but that doesnt seem to happen. It definitely gives people the wrong idea and  as you say  influences even professionals in how they view a patients ability to recoverimprove.I do wish that the possibility of BPD or CPSTD  although that would have been rejected even faster due to the direct implication of traumaabuse had been brought up when I was younger though which is I guess why I feel strongly that it shouldnt be entirely dismissed before adulthood even if the label should not yet be applied. I wound up getting misdiagnosed as autistic when I was  due to behavioural violence tantrums obsessive behaviour refusing eye contact and tactile hypervigilant agoraphobic misophonia issues and it stuck for so long because the very idea of a child showing BPD traits was so abhorrent that it had to be explained by something else.So yeah end of the day I dont like the BPD label either... it really needs to be renamed and recategorized. Its more unhelpful than helpful in most cases for sure.,bipolar,dcj9qvi,1,t5_2qnv4

10408812,0,t1_dcnpdy5,Before this experience I was an atheist with little regard for the importance of spirituality.  The conclusion I arrived at during my mania was essentially that love is the highest power god is love and the most loving of us are closest to god.  Everyone is capable of giving and receiving love so god is in everyone Or you could say that everyone is god.  Its not just that I logically arrived here but that I felt it so powerfully its impossible to ignore.  As it turns out mother teresas philisophy was somewhat similar to this.  My priorities have changed a bit.  Within  weeks of being released from the hospital I traded in my sports car for something more modest and its made me reexamine some of my other motivations.

I am not saying to do this or that would I ever recommend it by any means but I am just answering the question. For me hypomania isnt so terrible. Depression isnt really terrible except when it hits its extreme lows. Mixed states are my closest thing to Hell on Earth. Hypomania feels great to me. Kind of like a drug rush. It might be shitty to say but its one of the few times I am actually happy in life. Everything in the universe seems like it is in its proper place.As a particularly anxious person despite the energy with hypomania I get a sense of comfort. Something I dont feel to often. Much like my sense of overconfidence. I am not a particularly confident person but I get to live the lie for once and actually believe that I truly feel great am great can succeed in certain things etc..

Realistically bad credit will only keep you from getting loans from banksgetting housing. Many landlords wont rent to you and chances are youre not getting that mortgage.This segment by John Oliver does a much better job of explaining what Im about to say than I can. But regardless of ones credit one can find someone willing to lease them a car. Now the car isnt going to be in great shape and the interest rates are going to be ridiculous. Its somewhat similar when it comes to credit cards. There are credit cards even marketed toward people with bad credit labeled as credit building credit cards. These have very high interest rates and low credit limits. Its not uncommon for one to become inundated with mail from car dealerships and credit companies after they file bankruptcy. This is partially because they know youve got a bad financial situation and are likely to seek credit in some form or fashion. The other part of it is that they know if you borrow from them they have you by the proverbial balls as you cant file bankruptcy again for  years. ,bipolar,dcv4bx6,6,t5_2qnv4

They are loving kind and accepting. However part of me is still in negation and I feel deeply ashamed of my emotions and of my illness. In turn I feel how I described in the original post.

If its affecting your life please understand that you need to seek professional help. And theres definitely no need to feel embarrassed almost everyone has some kind of problem this is just something specific that can be treated with time amd proper care. Please dont be afraid to ask for help because bipolar disorder almost automatically places people in higher risks of self harmsuicidal tendencies. You can set up an appointment with a pdoc which might take a few weeks or more and that can give you time for comfort or something.  Talking with a psychologist for cognitive behavioral therapy might be helpful and they cant prescribe medication. A cognitive therapy type called DBT is specific for this disorder and if you can find it in your area might be great too. If it is recommended to be treated with medication theres plenty of successful options that can help and with insurance shouldnt be costly.

10772261,0,t3_5u3gfe,Hey there Ive got a semisimilar story to yours to an extent.My childhood was filled to the brim with abuse and trauma. My dad sent me to inpatient across the country when I was  because I was basically selfdestructing. The intake therapist tried to diagnose me manicdepressive but my dad is oldfashioned and said it was just hormones.Instead of videogames I wrote. I wrote all the freaking time. In any notebook I could get my hands on. I lost myself in fantastical madeup worlds. I read books any chance I got. My dad yelled at me once for reading the same book too many times.I feel like I was basically depressed my entire adolescence and manic my entire childhood. I actually just learned more about my mania Im gonna be posting about that in a bit and how selfdestructive I get in each mood.Things have gotten a little bit better since Ive been diagnosed. Since I now know the problem I know that there are solutions out there. Maybe Ill never get completely better but I can function. I try to hold onto that.If you dont mind me asking what meds are you on and how long have you been on them? Before I was diagnosed I had cycled through  different antidepressants all of which made me hypomanic and then crash even harder than the last time. Bipolar antidepressants did the same. Im now on a mood stabilizer and thats made a world of difference. I just tried wellbutrin and that threw me into the worst mania Ive ever experienced.I hate playing side effect roulette.Im so sorry youre dealing with all of this. This whole thing really does suck. But youve reached out and youre doing what you can. Thats a huge deal. I really hope you can acknowledge that at minimum.,bipolar,ddr2w31,1,t5_2qnv4

11234855,0,t3_60cz8b,Edit because I read your post history address your alcohol and drug problem before you consider whether you have bipolar disorder. You havent described anything consistent with bipolar disorder but Im gonna answer your question about manic depression. Youll have to speak with a professional to determine the cause and solutions to your mood swings and Im glad you intend to do so. This is just to answer your curiosity about bipolar disorder. Hypomania is a period of psychomotor agitation either with elation or irritability that may or may not interfere with ones life that typically lasts all day every day for two days or longer. For diagnosis the DSM says four days but all the science points to two days or more. Mania is more extreme psychomotor agitation with mood elation or irritability that lasts nearly all day everyday for seven days in the DSM or it can be shorter if it requires hospitalization. Mania can escalate to psychosis where a patient can no longer distinguish their imagination from reality. To have psychosis automatically differentiates hypomania to mania. The hallmark symptom and common cause of hypomania is insomnia. Mixed episodes are narrowly defined in the DSM and virtually all research indicates that mixed episodes have a more diverse symptomology and occur at a higher frequency than what the DSM V describes. The APA even has a task force set up to further investigate the gaps in the mixed episode criteria. Mixed episodes are mood episodes that feature both hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms simultaneously or in rapid succession. An example would be agitated depression a mood state described by Kraepelin in which a person might experience primary depressed mood with simultaneous psychomotor agitation like pacing racing thoughts irritability. Another example is dysphoric mania when a patient might experience primary elevated activity insomnia psychomotor agitation hypersexuality racing thoughts impulsivity even psychosis but also experiences feelings like emptiness or crying episodes. These are just examples mixed episodes can include a wide range of symptoms. Ive personally experienced mixed episodes for me theyre the worst type of episode. After my grandmother died I experienced an increase in my activity level and a decrease in my need  ability to sleep. I became intensely impulsive I abused drugs on a daily basis I nearly entered a relationship with a married woman and I did other risky things Id rather not think about. At the same time I felt empty cried regularly and had suicidal thoughts more than a few times. At some point I became psychotic I hallucinated dead bodies and believed the NSA was monitoring my actions as I delusionally believed I was guilty of a crime. So I had symptoms of depression feelings of emptiness crying spells suicidal thoughts during the same period in which I experienced manic symptoms insomnia psychomotor agitation hypersexuality substance abuse and psychosis. ,bipolar,df5geiu,5,t5_2qnv4

Not sure what yours are coming from but if its associated with a BP mood flare up they should go away when the mood is under control. Since my first manic episode Ive had lingering intrusive thoughts all the time of memories. Its like my mind somehow learned to open doors to random minute details and memories of stuff I dont even actively remember or think about. Stuff from like  years  years whatever just constantly popping into my head.Ive also been getting random intrusive thoughts about things unrelated to what Im doing. ex while doing the dishes the word popcorn comes into my head. This also happens in the morning when Im between awake and sleep as well like random nonsensical hypnagogic thoughts. ex the cow needs a ramen in Texas.Other types... in the past Ive had random thoughtimages of me walking across a highway when mad. Ive had intrusive thoughtimages of getting hit by a car in an accident. Ive had intrusive thoughtimages of planes combusting when they fly by.

11464048,0,t3_63kmzs,I used to before I started a legitimate bipolar treatment program. For a long time I was misdiagnosed with depression and as antidepressants failed to regulate my mood and behavior I supplemented with all kinds of drugs. Ive never taken street drug like cocaine or heroin but Ive taken around  different drugs in my day. Drugs I used most frequently to regulate my moods kratom etizolam phenibut fluoromethamphetamine methoxetamine in that order. I spent years dependent on kratom actually only quit two months and a day ago. I spent months psychologically dependent on etizolam but quit that about two years ago. I continue to use phenibut about once a week for music enhancement but it worked for both hypomania and depression which is nice. I used the meth analogue about once a week primarily for my ADHD before I was prescribed methylphenidate. Then I used methoxetamine mostly for fun but also as a last resort when I became too depressed to function. It relieved my depression for about a week after but it also tended to precipitate hypomania and even mimicked a manic mood for the duration of the high. I hardly used hard drugs by this time but I quit all but kratom and phenibut when I was put on abiliy last year. I continued to use kratom until I began lamictal two months ago because two of the fifteen deaths I know of related to kratom have involved lamictal. Ive quit two nasty habits. I used benzodiazepines from the moment I woke up until I went to bed from late  to early . I tapered off independently using the Ashton manual with the confidence that the antidepressant that Id begun would manage my anxiety without all the negative consequences. Then I slowly kicked my kratom habit beginning last December culminating in my complete discontinuation in April. In December I started taking breaks for several days to several weeks at a time then I finally decided Lamictal would be better in my life then kratom and it was time to cut my use completely. Something Ive always done to avoid withdrawal is to take the smallest amount I can get away with as infrequently as I can. Then instead of jumping off completely one day Ill take it two of every three days then every other day then stop. Ive done this with antidepressants benzos and kratom  times and it worked every time not saying itll work for other people but it did for me. ,bipolar,dfvfyce,1,t5_2qnv4

11575660,0,t1_dg7gwe7,I get that. I just want to assure you that its not going to be something played for jokes or something where if she just believed in herself enough she could get over it. The reason Im doing this and other research is because Bipolar Disorder is obviously one of the mental illnesses where its portrayal in media has been harmful to people who actually have it because of how it changes the publics perception. But to my mind that doesnt mean keep it and similar things out of all media because that would in no way change anything for the better.

11619421,0,t3_65qf5d,Hey it sounds like stuff i do but Im a guy and its a little bit different. First of all make sure you just dont stop taking your medicine that your doctor prescribed you. If you find that youre feeling better then keep taking it. If youre not feeling better tell your doc whats going on or make an earlier appointment next time if you think this will occur again and wait it out for the week or . That is key for this kind of stuff.As for your bf he is telling you these things because he cares about you obviously and he is saying it to you because you must be beautiful and  is that he might see that you are sad so he is trying to help you feel better which is a good sign. You might just feel bad because its not working that used to happen to me all the time. I felt worse when people tried to make me feel better when I was depressed or whatever because it was helping and I felt I was being mean to them by not feeling good. Its all in the medicine girl.

Instead I just distract myself with things I enjoy like video games reading walking and occasionally burying myself in my classwork. Hopefully over a period of time your emotions will settle youll be able to think about the situation differently and in the end not be so angry or sad.In general its important to get a grasp on what sets off certain moods for you and how to copedeal with those emotions before its uncontrollable. Also you dont have to think in ultimatums like I cant change this or I should let it go because its almost like youre disregarding your emotions which is even harder for most people. It might be better to just learn to accept the emotions and move on from there.,bipolar,dgdgzej,2,t5_2qnv4

11733459,0,t3_67eaz1,I feel you. Im BP II and hypomania is interesting in my marriage. When I was younger and undiagnosed I thought I was a genuinely terrible person for doing what I did over and over. While my husband was deployed I spent a LOT of money on basically nothing and when he came home we fought about it but I did it the next two times too. The fourth I was so depressed I couldnt have shopped and we saved a lot. Then I went low manic thanks to a medicine and it was a whole different set of problems. Weve been together for  years now married for . I feel like he deserves something different too sometimes. He is an amazing father a supportive husband and an all around good guy with his own demons. I dug deep into myself and made some absolutely necessary changes. When I hand him my debit card he doesnt ask why. When I text him and say Im having a bad day hes at home with chocolate milk and my favorite movie waiting. Conversely I do a lot for him. Doing for him and the kids keeps me sane honestly makes me feel better about who I am makes the wholes marriage better. If you can be honest with each other and he can understand youre not always  and you can understand he needs some special care too you might be able to make it work. Sounds like youre a considerate person from the self awareness in your post and I am confident you CAN make this work. ,bipolar,dgq0n1q,3,t5_2qnv4

Meds are so stupid for side effects.Remember that exercise can cause water retention though so dont just focus on the scale! Progress pictures are a great tool. I hope you find someone soon and can get on good meds. I know my pdoc mentioned saphris when he pulled out the samples while looking for Abilify samples and that one is also on the weight neutral side have you tried it? Otherwise hopefully you can find success on mood stabilizers. Maybe a mix of that and antidepressant if you need help with the depression.,bipolar,dgqlcwv,2,t5_2qnv4
