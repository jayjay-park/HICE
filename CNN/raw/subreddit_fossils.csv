1654479,0,t3_2dapyc,They came with a magazine called Dinosaurios that I read as a kid between  and  in Argentina. It was printed in Spain in  by Planeta  De Agostini. I think it was sold in Mexico too.Now that Im studying geology I wanted to have them in my house. When I found them in my parents house I thought that they were going to be labeled in the magazines or in the glass boxes but nothing. I can only remember that the teeth was from a shark I think and n was dinosaur poo but I may be wrong.Also how should I keep them away from damage? I was going to put them in a desk but away from direct light. How do I clean the glass boxes without adding humidity?Any other think that you have to say is welcome. Ill really appreciate it!,fossils,cjnpl7j,3,t5_2rptc

If you live by a university or a natural history museum I would recommend getting into contact with someone there. They would be able to appraise the quality of the fossil and since they would also be familiar with the area they should also know its rarity.If you can keep the large rock that its attached to even if you knock the fossil out of it. It looks like the outer layer of aragonite is attached to it and preserving the whole thing should make the fossil more valuable though heavy. I also recommend writing down information about where you got the fossil as not doing so always lessens the value. You want the location at least but if you can the formation and age of the formation are also important.,fossils,dam57z0,1,t5_2rptc
