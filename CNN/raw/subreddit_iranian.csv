Actually none of the mods here are proIRI two of them are atheists and one of them is a Zoroastrian that isnt necessarily inherently good as it would be nice to have a Muslim mod as well but it I think goes a long way in showing this sub isnt for the IRI its for everyone.

5545756,0,t1_cwkf1xe,gtIts just an article of clothing. My society dictates that I dont go out without wearing pants or a shirt A society that dictates that only women cover their hair is different from a society that dictates that both men and women cover their sexual organs. In the latter rules of public decency are genderequal whereas in the former only one gender is being forced to wear cumbersome and uncomfortable articles of clothing.  Now if you are a religious person youd say something like oh but thats because men have more more intense sexual urges than women and thats why women have to cover more of themselves  to stop men form acting on such urges. Im not a religious person but Im going to argue with you on religious terms because I know you are. Firstly there are many people who say that hijab is not required by either the Quran or the Hadith. Secondly the claim that men have stronger sexual urges than women has no basis in science. Men and women act differently in sexual contexts because of social norms and expectations. But even so lets assume  for the sake of argument that men do experience stronger sexual urges than women and consider the following scenarioThou shalt not steal.Imagine we have two different people who are strongly committed to this commandment.One of them avoids stealing by infallibly resisting the urge to take from others without their permission. The other one however avoids stealing by commanding that all things that might entice her to violate the commandment by stealing be removed from the premises. Now I ask you which person is more pure in their religious faith? which one deserves more praise and is more noble from a religious pov? I hope you see the analogy to the case of the hijab.EDIT I went about explaining my argument the wrong way. This is really what I meant to convey hereIt seems reasonable to expect the religious person him or herself to exercise their will and resist what they consider to be sinful urges rather than completely transfer the burden of their religious duties onto the shoulders of others. It is upon you to be true to your beliefs.,iranian,cwki340,7,t5_2s9nc

Zionism is the repatriation of the Jews to a land they have not lived in for centuries and in most cases millennia! on the homeland of a people previously subjugated by the British and before that the Ottomans. I completely agree that to Israeli citizens Israel has the most modern open society but at what cost? Israeli territory has been claimed through bloodshed and ethnic cleansing of the native Palestinian population. There are ! Palestinians living under illegal Israeli occupation ! living in an Israeli openair prison coupled with an illegal Israeli blockade and another ! living outside of their homeland because of forced Israeli ethnic cleansing.As we speak there are ! Israeli colonizers living on illegally occupied territory with more expansions on the way.Israeli military and intelligence services have committed themselves to taking down all of the opposers of their project in the region with aggressive overt and covert operations with Israeli war crimes terrorism and cyberterrorism claiming lives of Iranians and Arabs across the region.With all that said why should a real modern open society nation state such as Germany sacrifice its own interests for a state committed to carrying out their inhumane means to pursue their racial supremacist cause in the Middle East?,iranian,d029blg,8,t5_2s9nc

7913122,0,t1_d455b85,I think the Iranian political elite is no different than the US political elite in their love of power and corruptiona great deal of both. They are not yet as subtle in expressing those tendencies but they are getting there. The accusations however are not false. There is plenty of overt evidence for them.The very fact that we hear much more talk in Anglophone media of Iranian factional politics than we hear of US factional politics and in far more overt terms is itself a crucial piece of evidence.,iranian,d45iczp,2,t5_2s9nc

The acceptance of homosexuality is still a very recent thing in even the West and it will take Iran some time until it stops being seen as abnormal. Even most of Europe has not reached that point yet let alone Asian countries.I think youve been reading too much propaganda about Iran.,iranian,d711iyp,2,t5_2s9nc

8862363,0,t1_d7cqjfj,gti would like to thank you for such respect and i would like to point out a saying that we have in Iran which is showing respect to others is a sign of inner richness of a person and hope that my responses be of good use and because of that i Ask God the Greatest and the most merciful to bring you noor which is the biggest thing that a human could achieve so with that noor you can find the answers you are looking for in this life and to see what is to come in the life after.Thank you very much. I too wish you well. gtZionism is not Judaism. Judaism was chosen as the core of Zionism because of Jewish peoples shared history with people of Islamic lands. I am in agreement that Zionism is not the same as Judaism however they are linked in that the goal of Zionism was the return of the Jewish population to Israel. It is thus primarily a nationalistic movement. I do not find much conflict with your statements concerning past religions and prophets such as Moses Jesus and Muhammad except for some small things here and there. I will only mention onegtMohammad pbuh brought the message that would bring the end of human slavery to people and groups of people alikeIt is to my understanding that Muhammad brought progressive laws for slaves that improved the way they were treated and their condition in life but He did not abolish slavery. gtsince my computer gets randomly restarted i will reply on another post and this could be considered an intro to what im trying to explain.I understand. I look forward to your reply concerning the other topics not yet covered. Also if possible in your future replies I would very much enjoy sources in the form of books or links that answer some of the questions I posed in my previous post. This way I can analyze them myself. Thank you. ,iranian,d7d4ql5,2,t5_2s9nc
8903753,0,t1_d7i35yt,Yeah Im not at all surprised there are contingency plans especially big ones that focus on Iranian hegemony. The fact that they pulled the trigger and went with that plan speaks volumes about their arrogance especially in the face of something so blatantly illogical to even simple minds.It was a big plan and they were looking for any excuse but nevertheless Bush campaigned as an isolationist lame duck.,iranian,d7i3pcq,1,t5_2s9nc

There are virtually no views from either sect who say its permissible.The context of these words is VERY  applicable today especially with all the enemies of Islam who seek to destroy it..If youre going to call me a kafir youre going to need to PROVE it.Dont you realize how you are being the fundamentalist here?

10297337,1,t1_dcb7igr,It is true Iranian universities should be better and bigger and I am a supporter of that but it could easily be said it is because of sanctions. Also the embargo did not help matters. There are many reasons that neither you or I are qualified to decide on. Its mere speculation.And Syria isnt just Syria for Iran its everything. You will need to learn about Geopolitics to understand why. If Syria falls Irans revolution falls. Since its a revolutionary country obviously Syria is going to get its money. Syria is the land bridge to the Meditereannain sea this is strategic for Iran to keep an eye on NATO its enemy also to sell natural gas to Europe If Iran does not do it Qatar will take the market for themselves. And your Banana country will become even richer. Do you think Iran is stupid enough to allow this? Of course Syria will get the money it is a smart move for Iran even if ordinary Iranians dont understand why maybe they should study geopolitics in those universities.Iranians go to Western universities because they are Western not because they are universities. The university is just a means to and end to get to the West so they can experiment with immoral culture that is what its about it. Its like when youR parents in this case the government says dont smoke or drink well then you are going to go and smoke and drink but you cant do so at home in Iran so because they are a craftY people they find a way to do it outside of home international student visas and off they go. You can be sure they get involved in much more thaN studying at university when they go to thE West. The assumption that its because the universities are better isnt the point. Its the Western immoral culture theyre after like teenagers after a pack of smokes or a bottle of drink. Eventually they grow out of it and get married by then they are trapped by the Western economic system and indebted to it or stuck in careers they think they must sustain in order to maintain the expensive lifestyle they have acquired. Its a trap. Many end up missing Iran and go back every summer. Also many Iranians are depressed in the West although they wont show it in front of Western people. But other Iranians can tell when they meet them this is someone who misses Iran.At least those mud hut schools dont teach you its ok to kill unborn babies or its nice when a mother marries her son because that is what they talk about in liberal universities. That is considered equal and OK here. Be glad they dont teach that in Iran.Free debate in the West often involves a lot of name calling and petty personal remarks look at the Trump vs Hilary videos you can see Americans cant even have civil discourse without punching each other or calling each other rapists and racists. I hope you are not saying Western people are smarter than Iranians. Because we can see even under sanctions and embargo Iranians are able to out maneuver the entire block of Western nations and succeed when other nations would have capitulated by now. If Iranians have such bad luck they would have been defeated by now. Nobody has defeated them except in the time of Shah.You think Qatar is a banana nation? What exactly is your idea of banana nation? Is the UAE and Saudi Arabia also a banana nation because these countries are richer than most Western nations. Also Brunei and Malaysia. It is easy to dismiss what you dont agree with but you need to explain why they are banana countries. All countries are dependant on each other and not just oil nations. Western nations are rich because of their banks not because of their people and most Western people are not rich this is an illusion it is only a few people in the West that have money and the rest hate them for it there economic inequality in the West and its getting worse there is no middle class everybody has it or they dont.Many western people move to thailand or mexico because it is too expensive to live here the west is filled with immigrants. Many white people have left to the developing world and buy homes there. They have given up on living in the West. There are so many Europeans in South America so many Australians in Southeast Asia everybody looking for a cheaper life because the West has eaten all their money. Its a trap my friend.

Is that really the argument youre going with?Lets take a look at modern day Zoroastrians who live in India and other places. I assume theyre fucking their kids and siblings since they never had Islam to straighten them out right? No they arent.So what are some of the negative consequences of Islam? Stoning people for fornication and adultery? Executing people for being gay? Forcing women to cover themselves with veils? I would say that all of those things are even worse than siblings fucking.Look I get how terrible the consequences of the Mongol conquest were but at least those things arent keeping our country stuck in the past.
