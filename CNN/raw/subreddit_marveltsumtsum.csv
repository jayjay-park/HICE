6768626,0,t3_48gye3,I think for  satisfying your curiosity is worth it. Its not like coins are the limiting currency in MTT. Rainbow orbs aka rubies actually mean something!The challenge is a... challenge. The boosts are a trick! Its like grabbing free money from a booth. I do think they should probably increase the reward for the rd ball but Ive found that the nd ball is all you really need often seems to contain an iso of some kind. The cost to entry is nothing which is why the reward isnt super great. But since its a skillbased reward they should give it increasing rewards.,marveltsumtsum,d0ji5rw,2,t5_3apw1

8794505,0,t1_d74z7ut,Not that I know of really. I would be honestly surprised if you could as there are still some Tsums not released in the International version that the JP version has such as all of the Guardians of the Galaxy three of the five were part of the initial release of the game in Japan.,marveltsumtsum,d74zb1m,2,t5_3apw1

8868586,0,t3_51pl4x,My rankings plus thoughts . Vision  Even with the nerf he took from the JP version Vision still has the same overwhelming utility and use as before. You could MAYBE make a case to not use him on Large Tsum missions but he can still clear out enough Tsums to give you better chances more or less. Hes strong in battle strong for scores and strong in just about any mission there is. Being able to be used for anything is just why hes on his own Tier. . Drax  Hes actually similar to Vision except that he lacks the ability to really do long chains. Both his skills can clear large areas of Tsums making it easier to hit bosses in battle collect coins and get high scores. Large Tsum Missions are again a weakness here but like Vision he can side step it some. . SpiderMan  You might see a trend here. A Tsum with skills that covers large areas or can help out with a variety of missions without needing to change. Hes a bit weaker in the battles though as only his Special can target the Boss Tsums directly and until you level it up some only if theyre at the bottom. His Ability which I havent talked much of in the other two lets you reach out further on chains thusly letting you make longer chains as well so hes really good for chain missions and just piling on damage to bosses. . Thor  The God of Thunder has as the previous two very good Tsum clearing skills though I feel Drax and SpiderMans are still better overall. Being centered in the middle for both skills also makes it easier to hit with them especially at the higher levels and wracking up scores and coins isnt too hard to do now. Chances for Large Tsums to pop up with skill use is a nice bonus as well. . Hulk  Id have him higher if only because he generates Large Tsums which right now is a rare thing for Tsums to do but I really cant ignore the utility the other  have more or less. Hulk and Thor can really swap spaces depending on things though. The size of his Hulk Smash Special certainly doesnt hurt now really.Going to certainly have to revisit this in a couple of months when more Tsums are released as it is. This certainly will change.,marveltsumtsum,d7dvo9z,7,t5_3apw1
