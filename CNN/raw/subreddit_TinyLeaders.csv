2760612,0,t1_cnhuced,Thanks for the shoutout! It looks like you debudgeted things a bit. I like a lot of the upgrades but I have a few questions.. Is the  equip cost really worth it with Godsend or Sword of Vengeance? I always find them a bit too clunky. I like Godsend in my original list for the cute combo with Nemesis Mask but it looks like you cut that.. Im confused by White Suns Zenith. Your deck doesnt look like its set up to make a lot of mana.. Whats up with Journey to Nowhere? I keep seeing it in a bunch of lists. I think Condemn Oust or Sunlance is probably the better th Swords to Plowshares in your deck.Oh and I have a suggestion for your sideboard Peacekeeper.After board against aggro decks you can play him and suit him up with some hexproofness and probably get your opponent to scoop on the spot. To actually win the game after you play him just make hilarious numbers of cats until you decide its time to attack then stop paying Peacekeepers upkeep and just swing for about a million.Other sweet sideboard cards are Ethersworn Canonist And her friends Eidolon of Rhetoric and Rule of Law if youve got a really heavy combo metaand Enlightened Tutor as your th sideboard card it essentially gives you  copies of the other  if theyre all artifacts and enchantments.,TinyLeaders,cnhvd44,2,t5_2yl2s

2854695,0,t1_cnsefo2,What did you have do far? Creatures? Spells? I think this deck needs to have  lands and  creatures counting alesha. That leaves space for  instants and sorceries. Id like to throw one or possibly two anthem effects in there to compensate for Cauldron Haze persisting things with  toughness. In terms of creatures to prioritize allies and changelings come first. Its a very Why not all of them? thing in this case so long as they have less than two power. Heat Shimmer with means to have recursion on it may be funny. Flicker effects. Any creatures with fun ETB triggers thatll make combat awkward are good. Of course you need removal. ,TinyLeaders,cnskvec,1,t5_2yl2s

2906100,0,t1_cnyf2am,No problems!  The gameplan for mine is to try to be much more punishing in the early game with twoforones and PillarEidolon effects to make it easier for me when I get to the late game.  Ive had games where both players ended up at two life with a pillar on the board and the game is stalled until I draw my Bonfire or Devils Play for the win.  On that note I have to applaud Devils Play for being absolutely fantastic.Also I may have to slot in Glimmer.  It may be more expensive but the fact thats its instant speed means that on the play you can snipe a drop out of their hand on the fourth draw step.

3014235,0,t1_coab1dt,Well you  want green for things like Life from the Loam Sylvan Scrying and Crop Rotation. White is pretty good for Knight of the Reliquary and Enlightened Tutor for crucible or other things. Black is good for Entomb and Cruel Tutor. Blue might add consistency with cantrips and draw. Red doesnt really add much usefulness though Gamble is always fun.For mono green youd probably just go with Azusa Lost but Seeking.For GW maybe Selvala though Gaddock Teeg and Saffi Eriksdotter have some utility.Junk only has two options Id probably just go with Doran the Siege Tower.I like GWx a lot more than just GB and none of the GB commanders really have any synergy with the combo at all. Glissa could do work as a blocker though so Id probably pick her.For Bant Angus Mackenzie can help you stall out but Jenara is an efficient beater if the combo fails.,TinyLeaders,coaf9oa,2,t5_2yl2s

3169144,0,t1_coqentd,Serras Avenger is actually really strong. The Drawback isnt that terrible at all. Tithe is outright better than Gift of Estates.  you get to turn one it and still drop Thalia on time. Sword of Fire and Ice and Heros Blade should both also be in here. Cut Gift of Estates for TitheNearheath Pilgrim for KatakiPearl Medallion for SoFIAfterlife for Heros BladeWhitemane Lion for Serra AvengerTrue Believer for Wing Shards BoardStory Circle for Kor Firewalker BoardElixir of Immortality for Ethersworn Canonist BoardWing Shards gives you an additional out postboard to games against Animar Decks and to any deck that has access to TrueName Nemesis. Ethersworn Canonist helps hedge your bets against Animar decks as well. You really need to be ready to beat Animar because you have to make him too expensive very fast and then close fast as well. Wing Shards helps a ton because they will usually cast prior to combat to buff him up so you do become able to  for  them easily. It is important that you spend your other removal on any mana dorks they have. It is one of your only ways to bottleneck their decks development.  You naturally have a great storm matchup due to Thalia. and your main deck Glowrider amp Spirit OTL  PostBoard you get Canonist Rhetoric and RIP on top of all that. Elixir is too narrow especially when you want to bring in RIP to stop flashback.  I think you are favoured in Storm if you can land Thalia. Both swords are excellent against them because you either get Thalia to have ProBlue or you start attacking their hand. The Story Circle is mostly for Burn Matchups And Kor Firewalker does that better. The life gain the body and the protection make him a nightmare. If burn is popular in your meta I would add Circle of Protection Red to your board.RIP and Wing Shards hedge your g against Infect.  You also have plenty of removal in the Main Board when they try to go all in. MoM and Mirran Crusader help a ton. I am not totally sold on Blind Obedience but I imagine the Lifegain is Relevant G against Burn and the second etb tapped effect on top of Sovereign against haste. If I was going to cut it I would add AEther Vial in its place.  I think that merits testing. GL!  ,TinyLeaders,coqhax0,1,t5_2yl2s

3227208,0,t1_cowhrdz,The Hanna list needs a little work the opening hands have a ridiculous amount of variance. When its good its very good. When its bad its horrible.I think I have too much  mana removal. I plan on cutting the curve down a bit. However I never really found myself with too many of one and not enough of the other. The sample size may be too small but Ive never had trouble producing threats. My bodies are often big enough to emerge from combat in pretty good condition.Ive gone all in on toughness matters before I think it just makes the deck bad. Too many times a single removal spell ruins the whole board because there are suboptimal dudes. I play Doran over Anafenza because hes my favorite MTG card period.  Sygg was control with a mill wincon. Drownyard I think. Unfortunately I didnt get to watch much of that deck. I think it went . Im not sure how optimal of a list it was.,TinyLeaders,cowi6kb,2,t5_2yl2s
3235381,0,t3_2x5y0y,Hey man!  I put together a list of a similar type but instead of straightup life gain it was basically White Weenies with a Soul Sisters Flair list here    Just a few notes  Ive always found Martyr of Sands pretty underwhelming since its a fairly dead draw late in the game.  Its amazing to get an online Ascendant on turn  but other than that its not too strong.  Since my list is more aggrooriented I just switched it out for Isamaru since hes pretty much the best aggressive onedrop.If youre going allin on Life gain though Id recommend moving Path of Bravery to the Mainboard.  Its very strong with Brimaz and also another inclusion you could make with Militias Pride which can power out awesome numbers of tokens to gain you even more life!Another thing with my deck being more aggressive is that I play much more spot removal and creatures that remove threats as well as just better threats.

If I have a lock up it can win the game but in the same scenario Luminarch Ascension is better.

3603765,0,t1_cq31k75,I agree. If you t stoneforge t drop sword of BampM t swing they have drawn  total cards so t t t t required for a kill via milling.If you t stoneforge t drop FampI start swinging t and shocking face each time its  damage a hit which takes  hits t t t t t to kill.Both assume no fetches or shocks have been used by your opponent but I think a  turn difference is negligible. If your opponent doesnt play their whole hand right away WampP kills them faster than FampI and BampM.Milling is a common strategy and most people board in hate against it boarding it against bampm is just as effective.

3680795,0,t1_cqbtpfd,I see. Im not sure then that unwinnable is a good baseline. A better baseline would be the point at which youd want to switch decks from Ezuri to something different i.e. given Esper Control at a certain  of the metagame do I feel comfortable playing Ezuri?That then involves taking known matchup win  against various decks in the field and if Esper is the only significantly negative one and is a small percentage of the field I likely dont switch.If its not the only negative one and I expect a significant percentage of the field to be playing Esper or another unfavorable matchup and can switch to a more favorable deck then I switch.The trick then is coming up with some numbers and seeing where they end up. Is this daunting? Probably. You need a lot of data and probably some simulation as well.I still lean towards opening up the nonlinear spellbased combo decks as they tend to overpower creaturebased combo while making better sideboard targets. That approach works over strategies like Ezuri from both ends metagamewise.,TinyLeaders,cqbu234,1,t5_2yl2s

6964876,0,t1_d150mx9,gt  This is some amazing advice thank you so much!Im not sure I understand the point of Ghitu Slinger would something like shock not be better?Im looking forward to trying these out thank you again.,TinyLeaders,d15syun,3,t5_2yl2s
7185917,0,t1_d1uygjh,Ahh I was kind of scratching my head as to why it wasnt a damn autoinclude in my list in the first place... Makes a lot of sense now.,TinyLeaders,d1uz5y0,1,t5_2yl2s

9131865,0,t3_559ldl,So basically you guys or should I say  person have still kinda not let the format die yet and are going to maybe fix the ban list?.....great.If you actually gave a shit about the format you would hand over control to a new group of people that actually have the initiative to manage the format.The people that own tiny leaders kind of seem like selfish pricks. You dont want to let go of your format and watch it prosper. Youd rather cling to it and let it die.The format sucks because the management sucks. ,TinyLeaders,d89j2pk,3,t5_2yl2s

11276183,0,t3_60es8z,sorry I am not able to auto card right nowI think you could add Fatal push black sun zenith hymn to tourach and thoughtseize.  You could also possibly add the two mana lose two to draw two spells.I thought the x drain spells looked a little clunky.  I am also not a fan of the cards that give your opponent a choice like dash hopes or pains reward.  Dash hopes also does not trigger your general.  so if it is a creature you NEED to counter hexproof or pro black they will just pay  life.  Seems like another kill spell would fit better.  The other counterspell seems pretty sweet though.I also really like the fast mana because the card advantage from your general should offset the downside.sorry that was a bit rambling.,TinyLeaders,dfa50jz,1,t5_2yl2s
11534201,0,t1_dg3egev,Weve managed to make a pretty cool modified commander format out of it.  Thank you very much for your help though,TinyLeaders,dg3ejvy,3,t5_2yl2s
