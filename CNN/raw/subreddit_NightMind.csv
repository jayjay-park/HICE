10122473,0,t1_dbqy5fj,I would definitely agree with you here. But Im convinced that one of the best things Nick could do is consult with some professional marketers about growing his brand. Personally I dont know anyone in that field but I think that an investment in this field would help him grow way more than mere word of mouth. Its not about selling out or anything so childish as it is recognizing the Night Mind name as its own entity and doing everything you can to help it grow.,NightMind,dbqyr41,3,t5_3dd1g
