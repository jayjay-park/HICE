43620,0,t3_1ulexb,I would write a short letter to the head of the clinic outlining your complaint. IncludeSimple facts about time and date. No accusations or bad language.End off withI did not expect the doctor to put his religious views before the aims and objectives of your health clinic.On the one hand I understand that your clinic does enjoy a captive audience and has no shortage of customers. On the other hand I hope that the clinic understands it is part of a community and that it may want to be more transparent about the community perception it wishes to foster.As a first resolution to my complaint I would appreciate it if you had a formal procedure for the receptionist to inform the patient if the treating doctor imposes their own personal religious objections to certain medical treatments.  I hope you will agree that this would benefit your clinic because then that clinicians time would be more efficiently spent with patients who are more morally aligned or where those objections are not relevant to the treatment plan.I have included Medicare Australia on this letter so that they may decide whether it is appropriate to fund the bulk bill aspect of the alleged consultation I received in this instance. medicare.provhumanservices.gov.au  If the clinic is in any way state government funded then also send a copy to your state minister for health.Money Talks. . and three stamps later you should get some pleasing replies ,auslaw,cejebhz,24,t5_2stjv
115892,0,t1_cerenho,gt But if you buy a brand new car and it stops working within  days you can take it back whether the seller tries to limit the time or not.You need to be careful with this.  In  days you could have driven that brand new car across Australia and back.  Even in a couple of days you could have gone offroad driven through potholes filled it with the wrong type of fuel had the clutchaccelerator down at the same time whilst in motion moved your auto transmission into reverse whilst the car was going forward received stonechips from other vehicles allowed birdshit to burn the paint work or whatever else.  Even if you didnt ... can you prove you didnt?  The car dealer is going to have many reasons not to accept even a  day old brand new car.General rule of thumb I heard is you need to get that new car back with very low kms  very quickly like within the same day if you want the car dealer not to give you any trouble.  It is also important not to feel rushed to drive it off the forecourt.  Check every button look carefully along the paintwork for defects check all the interior trim and seals by the windows. Take    minutes over it before leaving the garage with your new car.Of course  there is a new car manufacturers warranty but that is limited  subject to following the servicing requirements which are both km and time based.,auslaw,cermllg,3,t5_2stjv

Ill take any that I can get.Unfortunately for me I live right in the middle of Sydney and so the CLCs and other free legal clinics still have to force students to compete for the volunteer positions. Its my first time applying since they dont take on firstyear students but Ive been told by those who have volunteered at the places Ive applied to that its really quite difficult to get a spot. I feel like my application was strong though so well find out in a few weeks whether or not it was good enough.The fortunate thing about where Im applying is that theres so much work that Ill be exposed to a lot of different areas of law which is excellent.Thanks for the headsup on applying for clinical internships through my Uni.

267256,0,t3_1x4ypm, Here is my schpeel for educational purposes only. I am not a lawyer if you act on this to your detriment youre a moron. . The law on interaction with police varies from state to state. There is no one answer here. . In QLD the governing law is the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act. The Act sets out when you can and when you must talk to the police Generally in QLD police can request ID from you in prescribed circumstances. If you are in a situation where you would not reasonably be expected to have ID ie swimming at the beach you can provide a name and address otherwise an officer may ask you for proof of ID. Failure to comply with an officers lawful direction is an offence under the PPRA and each prescribed circumstance has different defenses that would absolve you of liability if you fail to comply with the law. The Circumstances You can required to provide ID if you are found in the process of committing an offence  You can be IDd if the officer has reasonable suspicion you were involved in committing an offence  You can be IDd if you can aid in the investigation of an indictable offence. A crime or misdemeanor see  of the Crim Code Qld.  If an officer has a reasonable belief you may aid in the enforcement of a regulation this is a higher standard than suspicion meaning an inclination toward assenting to rather than rejecting a state of being.  If you have been lawfully stopped by an officer on the road you must provide ID lawfully stopped means to enforce road laws alchy or even to investigate your stereo for being too loud  If you have been asked to tone down the noise in your dwelling.  If you consent. Note consent requires that you have the knowledge that you are able to refuse. When an Officer May Interview You Note that this is a bit dumbed down and there is much more to it. . You do not have a requirement to talk to the police to help them with their investigation see Rice v Connolly. No adverse inference can be technically drawn against you for staying silent.  . If you are a relevant person one being held in police company for the purpose of being questioned about your suspected involvement in an indictable offence you must have been warned of your right to remain silent. This doesnt apply to undercover cops. . You will have the right to counsel if you are a relevant person. Police must delay questioning for at least  hours to wait for counsel unless circumstances warrant otherwise. Honestly my ADD kicked in and Im too lazy to go on.  Look at S of the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act to see when you can be searched  ish for your searches of dwelling ish for strip searches and read Nguyen v Elliot for info on disobeying the police. Now I say all this with the caveat in crim one of the first videos they showed us was the police in Surfers kicking the living piss out of a lippy kid and then kicking the shit out of his dad. So you can wave this legislation in a coppers face all you want. But you might end up dead right as my dad used to put it. ,auslaw,cf8glz3,1,t5_2stjv

Under  youd have to be in a de facto relationship for a time or earn a certain amount of money in a given time to prove your independence. Moving out of home does not in itself prove it. Also there is no such thing as an independent payment. Either youre independent and your parents income isnt take into account or youre dependent and your parents income is taken into account.

1602905,0,t1_cjgy2rw,There are many intelligent deserving law degree entrants who will do well in practice and will find their niche. Dont be discouraged by this article which is about a guy who probably hasnt been able or willing to tough it out in practice himself. I dont know any lawyers who would bother with this sort of discussion or setting up a website like Mr Liew has. They simply wouldnt although I can see that Liew has a reason to do it. I just dont think theres anything useful or novel about it compared with using a forum or networking with lawyers in business.The real problem with law today is that anyone who can fog a mirror is being allowed to study at university and some get into law and many of them show it they do it for social status which is a mind boggling thing to encounter. I have a neighbour who is married to a lawyer he himself only got into law after doing a year or two of Arts not getting into law straight after school who was a poor student at school and a decade or more after leaving school decided to study law and it shows. Why was a place at law school given to her? She has never practiced never been admitted to practice and never wants to. After hearing her speak for  minutes you would run out of her office were she ever to practice. She is a mother and works in a wholly unrelated industry. But for the massive increase in law schools in the late ss she would never have been able to study law. My friends and I regard her as dimwitted and slow. University has become a business and she was a customer. Its that easy.The effect of this is that when I meet anyone with a law degree its really a big meh. It means little today. Like has always been the case experience matters. High school grades matter and getting into your chosen degree matters then entering whatever profession you want to work in matters.

The assessment is actually a particularly difficult one since its been given later in the semester than usual.For Question  go through each of the separate clauses individually. The way youve asked your question here doesnt describe very well what youve been asked to do. There are four clauses in the trust and each of them has one or more issues that youll need to write about and they also have some issues in that they conflict with each other. Youve identified a good issue with Clause A in your third dotpoint however you also need to consider all of the other clauses. For instance Clause B screams Giumelli to me but I cant quite articulate what the effect of it would be without giving it more consideration than I have already.Regarding your main question Re Clause A which is about delegation of decision making power to third parties you need to consider the notes from the class that youve had that contained the readings on the duty of trustees to act personally. It comes from the Trustee Act and requires that decisions cannot be delegated Re Brockband is a case concerning this where the trustees attempted to act under dictation. Other cases that are relevant but not synonymous are Horan v James where property was left on trust to anyone but my wife though this was a postmortem trust which operates very differently and McPhail v Doulton Again postmortem however this decision heavily influenced Horan v James.Hope that helps a bit!,auslaw,ckml1ow,3,t5_2stjv

I accepted a job at my DREAM firm with my DREAM boss it was a well known criminal firm with many famous high profile crime matters with very small family dept and an active but small com lit side. I had worked with the partner who headed up the crime department in a criminal course at Uni which is where and from whom i was offered the job I had never met the other partners. Naturally I assumed I would be working in crime.  Not so much at the time i was given com lit matters because a few high end high profile matters were all going to trial at once so they NEEDED someone. Turns out I am good at comlit so I never got out of that department there. The firm ended up kinda internally combusting so when i started to smell the trouble I bailed. All my experience was in Com lit so I got a job at a commercial firm who needed a litigation lawyer I ended up heading the department and now I am kinda trapped.  My whole resume is geared towards Com lit I am hoping to take the opportunity to start all over again when i finish maternity leave... in  years time. It will be starting again wage wise but after living on one wage for as long as we have I am pretty sure any money will make me feel like im rich... and after that long out of the game I will be needing to start all over again,auslaw,cn5o1wz,5,t5_2stjv

I take the statement quoted above as meaning the fact an executive officer is operating outside of Australias borders does not in itself allow an officer to detain a person without statutory authority.     There may be factual scenarios that require other considerations to be accounted for which may authorise the detaining a person without the statutory power to do so and I believe Hayne and Bell JJ also acknowledged this at  but operating outside of Australias borders cannot on its own provide such authorisation.,auslaw,co4kxfx,3,t5_2stjv

3599478,0,t3_31hpw7,You mentioned But that doesnt stop employers from discriminating against my lack of degree.Ive been facing this from the other end  reviewing job applicants  and it isnt quite the way it may appear.  The problem is that potential employers simply dont have all information about every applicant  we can only evaluate on a limited set of information. We try our best to probe in interviews to get a feel as to how wide and deep knowledge is in the topics we care about .. but we know its a flawed process and at the end of the day we have to make decisions based on incomplete information.  And one item of that incomplete information is sadly university degrees.  If they have a degree we know that theyve at least studied certain subjects and certain approaches.  Another one for iOS programmers is having publicly available Apps on the Appstore .. internal employeronly apps are less relevant  even if they are a thousand times more relevant in any other metricOne thing that makes the problem worse for both of us is recruiters.  They filter on much more arbitrary categories like keywords and degrees and their hefty fees  means that we are forced to take the safe option.So the discrimination over a degree and other seemingly arbitrary qualifiers is a real issue.

An individuals recourse is inbuilt  by definition theyre going to court. You dont need a separate right of appeal because youre already going to argue about the substance of that decision.The decision not to prosecute is entirely unfettered. The AG has his or her own right to proceed on indictment and a member of the public can commence summary proceedings depending on the jurisdiction but no person can appeal against the prosecutors decision to decline to proceed.Just finally on your point about a campaign by a particular DPP against an individual their recourse would be to have the court declare that the proceedings are an abuse of process  but if there is an arguable case that the person actually committed the offences then why except for practicality shouldnt they be prosecuted for everything they actually do wrong?,auslaw,cr7j1m7,5,t5_2stjv

4344391,0,t3_3aq1ym,Copyright law has failed to keep up with several aspects of modern IT. Firstly the ease with which content can now be copied although the ease of breaking a law shouldnt affect its validity in reality it affects how we perceive that law. When people looked at a paper book or CD they saw a physical object that took money and effort to create. They understood that the creator also needed compensation but that was just a component of the purchase price. You received a valuable physical object in consideration for your dollars.For many people the morality of paying a creator is far too abstract when the act of copying is itself free. They can rationalise it easily the evil publishing empire shouldnt be entitled to their cut I wouldnt have bought it anyway it isnt worth that much. And our modern world is filled with confusing messages of price. Why is it OK to timeshift a movie recorded from freetoair TV but not OK to download the same pixels from bittorrent? Why is some content OK if I play this  second ad first even if I avert my eyes and dont watch the advertisement?The moral underpinnings of copyright law used to be much simpler. And just like inconvenient jaywalking laws rules that appear arbitrary are often ignored.The second key change is the rise of open source software and other free community driven content. By setting an apparent price point of free the open source movement has set a benchmark for the price value of software. Being able to obtain my news for free from Reddit has likewise set a starting point for what I am willing to pay for news content.And many people then begin to wonder what the point of copyright is. It was established as a temporary localised monopoly in order to encourage content providers to create more content and advance society. But when engineers are prepared to invest vast amounts of highly skilled effort into creating OpenOffice or Linux or FreeBSD or thousands of other innovative products and when academics professionals and others are willing to invest their time to create wikipaedia or provide legal advice on rauslaw just kidding then we must again question why copyright lasts so long and is such a necessary tool to encourage humanity to create things.Just a few thoughts before my morning coffee...,auslaw,csfcebd,7,t5_2stjv

Its difficult to justify partner level fees for patent specifications that were already drafted overseas where the only real new work is to recommend some superficial changes to get it through IP Australia.Thus partners are now economically savvy IP consultants that can help you manage your IP portfolio.,auslaw,cxe4549,3,t5_2stjv

6120066,0,t1_cyl960t,gtTo say that that is a mere speculative effect is not really true.I think were at crosspurposes on this point.  By speculative I really only mean that any effect on the enduser is one step removed and is realistically conditional upon future events.  To use an admittedly clumsy analogy that effect is more akin to the second limb of Hadley v Baxendale it logically flows from the making of a discovery order but it is not the direct effect.gtThis is a very dangerous line of reasoning. Try to get my medical records and while it may be my doctor who has to tell his secretary to email them to the applicant its sure as heck my interests that are being affected.First off I think youre placing more weight onto that sentence than I meant you to as all I was really saying was that Whirlpool leafing through its records and turning up the info is the direct effect as opposed to the consequential effect.Secondly while were being frank I think your analogy to medical records is too long a bow to draw.  For starters someones name particularly someone against whom the Prospective Applicant has an arguable cause of action is hardly on the same level of sensitivity as someones medical records.Further this is a prelim discovery app to identify prospective respondents not prospective causes of action.  I can think of few circumstances in which unredacted medical records or other documents of similar sensitivity would be required to identify a prospective respondent.If Whirlpool operated a private forum and the application was for prelim discovery of posts on that board for the purposes of identifying a prospective cause of action then your medical records analogy would be more persuasive.  But in a respondent identity case I dont think it is.And I think that underlines my point which is this the password issue aside which seems bizarre to me as well were not dealing with objectively sensitive info here.  Names and contact information supplied voluntarily to Whirlpool by the endusers themselves isnt weighty stuff.  Accuse me of being high and mighty if you like but I feel Whirlpool has something of a civic duty to hand that objectively nonsensitive info so that the Prospective Applicant can test its claims and potentially be vindicated and consenting was a reasonable action.  Perhaps its a cultural thing here where Australias convict heritage and the maxim of snitches get stitches dictate that we should be outraged at Whirlpool but Ive never really gotten on board with that sort of attitude.  Im clearly too continental.gtReading the judgment I dont think costs were ordered by consentIll admit to only briefly skimming the judgment so I assumed the costs orders were also consented to.

In Australia theyre all pretty much terrible for one reason or the other. Part of the problem is that particular vertical market doesnt demand featuresimprovements at the pace of most software the lawyers who control the purse strings are still mainly dinosaurs. LEAP is the equivalent of Microsoft in the s. Their software is awful but they have their market sewn up tight. Their latest cloud based but not really cloud based because it still uses desktop clients is slightly better than their previous offering. However it still uses a proprietary database on the backend called D which is not great. Support is not ideal. I have encountered many bugs. Solutions usually consist of helpful suggestions like dont do that then. LawMaster is a MSSQL.NET solution  the client UI is very Windows  with lots of explorer trees and mystery icons and clunky navigation. They do now offer some kind of SaaS solution which I havent used. I had a gutfull of all of them so I nerded out and wrote my own to do just the things I need in litigation. The code is a bit rough laravel but its entirely web based has a simple API and integrates with Google Apps.

8106650,0,t1_d4r7lec,Im comfortable assuming Collectively the  members of the current government are quite intelligent. Amongst those  members of the current government at least one of them would be smart enough to know how to create a Reddit account. After all uPMKevinRudd managed to create a Reddit account and I expect that the current Prime Minister is far more tech savy than the old one. It is not a huge leap to assume that with enough research that one smart enough to be able to create a Reddit account would be smart enough to work out how to become a moderator of a subreddit.I also think the following facts are interesting. The body attempting to stop umjec was a shadowy government department known as the Australian Electoral Commission. In some circles they go by the letters AEC So secretive is the AEC that they wont even give details about how they do a simple task of counting sheets of paper. According to the SMOS another secretive government website the AEC has a Special Minister of State. Interestingly the SMOS does not reveal who this Special Minister is. In an art of deception several of the News articles suggest that the Special Minister is somebody called Hon Ronaldson. I managed to locate Hons personal website and interestingly it reveals that he is not the Special Minister. I did however discover through the conspiracy uncovering website wikipedia that the real Special Minister is a Belgian man known only as Mathias Cormann. Now lets turn to the area of Government that has all the money the aptly named Department of Finance. Several hours of research on the Department of Finance website reveal an interesting link... one Mathias Cormann So now lets look to Mathias Cormanns personal web page where he makes a startling admission. This Mathias Cormann fellow admits to have been part of something called the Opposition Shadow MinistryI put it to you that it is no coincidence that the Belgian Opposition Shadow Ministry who has an interest in Australias finances has both the means and reason to silence umjec.

Are they actually gambling with real money or is the gambling for skins and items which I accept are probably convertible to money?I feel like most of the people in the comments sections of these videos assume everyone is familiar with the world of CSGO gambling.Disregarding the gamblingspecific issues and treating this whole thing as being subject to Australian law its not actually that obvious to me how this is illegal.
