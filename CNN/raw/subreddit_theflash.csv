He doesnt have a strong father figure because obviously he needs to gravitate towards Barry. Hes a child because he has to grow which is why so many people love Wally in the first place. I got tons of Wally I got young Wally old Wally college Wally kids Wally now a new generation. I loved Wally as KF and now I get to see it happen again. What you want The New  to have a character thats been established for years? Dont be selfish. This is the Real Wally and I think well all get over it real fast.

3869143,0,t3_34fm3w,I posted this theory on the other sub. I think it might be something else..I think it is going to be whatever the spinoff CW show is. I think that with Thawne bound to release all the pipeline villains directly or indirectly Barry is going to need a new base of operations. S.T.A.R. Labs will also need to start taking a role in the metahuman response given their appearance is becoming an accepted phenomenon with Everymans case and their connection to S.T.A.R. Labs is becoming more apparent Iris just connected the dots. So S.T.A.R. Labs may institute some kind of metahuman treatment facility where they can train superheroes under the guise of treatment and send them one isolated missions making a format where various heroes can pop in and out. Team Flash has even been gathering at Barrys lab more due to Thawne so weve sort of been prepped into the idea of that being Barrys home base.Just my theory.,theflash,cqxbdro,2,t5_2tzdy

You might think so but remember what weve learned about your reading comprehension skills.What I did say was that the quality ratio in the new is comparable to prenews quality ratio. Assuming thats true it would suggest that the main problem with the new is that some people are too nostalgic for the older stuff to accept any kind of significant change regardless of the quality of the work.

ALL THAT Hype and DC jizzed their load on a girlfriend that paled in comparison to patty or Iris and a best friend thats just about as forgettable as a bad guy can be. Stereotype. Mediocre.

No. These days the model is actively based on a kind of...Library ethic. Sit in there all day buy coffee read a book.Its so short sighted its unreal  and the sad thing is its probably happening in a lot of areas because our libraries are getting less and less funding. Hell..In my area theyre talking about reducing libraries by  over the next three years. Let me show you something. This was our old libraryTheyve closed it down because that rendering is the future site of the Plymouth Heritage Centre   million of mirrored glass.ThisIs what they replaced it with. The beautiful turn of the century which actually housed some of the rarest books in the country is gone and while its kind of ok because its expanding the museum Im angry and saddened at the same time.,theflash,d7zgd1t,1,t5_2tzdy

10756384,0,t1_ddp76t2,Hmm well I havent properly thought it out yet. Im assuming Robinsons Earth  would be unchanged so I guess I would have Jay have the post crisis origin hero of Keystone during WW which was hidden and forgotten until Central Citys heroes uncover it. So meeting Jay wouldnt involve the multiverse but the adventures the three go on would. Maybe theres a multiversal threat again that the Justice Incarnate find out about but cant stop. I guess maybe its another attempt by the Empty Hand or maybe its the Empty Hands nighomnipotent and destructive sibling the Bare Foot. They figure out that only something like the speedforce can stop its a multiversal force that influences all of spacetime and probably other dimensions through out reality Im expanding it it operates in all multiverses but with slightly different properties in each maybe. I just want it to be omniversal cause of stuff like staring at the face of God. Anyway as shown recently SUPERMAN REBIRTH MULTIPLICITY SPOILERSs Red Racer died like a Flash always does a hero. So Justice Incarnate dont have their main speedster ready to rally the others. Luckily our old friend from Kwyzz electric Sonic Krakkl appears. Since Kwyzz is connected to the speedforce wall they were able to sense this new threat because the Bare Foot is affecting fundemental forces or something and its an indicator that its about to screw things up. So Krakkl joins the team and hes tasked with gathering all the other speedsters to help. The speedforce is powerful and mysterious it may have a hand in predetermined events it may not but its not really conscious. Its a larger than life force of nature. The Flashes of the multiverses are needed to direct its power to stop the Bare Foot from corrupting and destroying reality one step at a time literally one step I think.So naturally the first stop is Earth . Krakkl was Wallys childhood imaginary friend but of course hes not imaginary. This being Earth  centre of the local multiverse and Wally having recently started to mainline the speedforce after being the first to enter and return has made him the ideal first recruit. Of course they go tell Barry and Jay and they form The Lightning Brigade first squad of the larger team that will be known as Speed Incarnate.The four of them then travel the multiverse recruiting the other speedsters. Eventually they have as many speedsters as they can recruit in the local multiverse and Speed Incarnate meets up with Justice Incarnate on the House of Heroes. Suddenly the Bare Foot makes his entrance into the bleed of the local multiverse and starts wrecking shit. Its less subtle than the Empty Hand which employed the Gentry to slowly fuck things over. Bare Foot wants to just stomp on everything at  different levels of reality. Wally and Jay lead the battle against the Bare Foot with some of the most intelligent members of both teams trying to figure where it came from how it has its powers and how to stop it. Through use of speedstealing speed lending manipulation of movement phasing etc they manage to keep the Bare Foot occupied in the bleed so it doesnt start interacting with any of the distinct universes. Some of the speedsters die sorryMeanwhile Barry and Krakkl build a new cosmic treadmill. This one allows them to travel to the other multiverses that were hinted at in Multiversity with the Gentry having already ruined one. Here we see them recruiting more speedsters and seeing the many more universes DC Comics can explore. Take this chance to showcase Barry being just a really upstanding hero as he uses his superspeed to help out each new Flash we meet before they continue the omniversal journey.continued in reply,theflash,ddpfv7e,2,t5_2tzdy

11529198,0,t3_64kjs3,Remember that when you read about Barry in Wallys stories that you are essentially reading them from Wallys point of view. Barry comes across as more serious because thats what Wally needed from him. Writers used that to play off Wallys more impulsive cocky nature. This is even mentioned in one of Wallys stories. Superman is telling Wally about how funny Barry could be doing two man comedy bits by himself and Wally states surprise that Barry could be that silly. Barry in his day was fun and made jokes. His humor is a bit different than Wallys largely because of the era each character was written in but he certainly is the stuffy character he was sometimes made out to be in some of Wallys books. ,theflash,dg2u4ki,9,t5_2tzdy
