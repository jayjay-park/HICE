5967980,0,t3_3x5ubr,Very fact specific question but it depends on the nature of the debt. Debts incurred before the LLC existed may be just personal debts even those acquired after LLC formation might be personally guaranteed. Apart from wanting to use liquidation value for tax debts I dont often recommend an LLC file bankruptcy. If all debts are personal the business BK wont help. If all debts are business only you might have a dissolution procedure under state law that is the same or better than bankruptcy.,Bankruptcy,cy1xm62,1,t5_2qt29

Theyve made it a little harder for you to prove youve made your payments for a new loan underwriter. Get your cancelled checks and do it another way. ,Bankruptcy,d0m2p74,1,t5_2qt29

8960805,0,t3_52xejj,These are very complex questions that require knowledge of community property law  divorce  and extensive bankruptcy experience.  Im usually willing to answer questions  but these are just more than I could responsibly answer in this forum.  If you need help finding a free consultation near you  shoot me a PM.  I would help you find one. ,Bankruptcy,d7oycyo,1,t5_2qt29
10002634,0,t1_dbbbsyr,Im not a lawyer so I have no idea what the trustee means by Order to Debtors to Show Cause why the order for relief should not be set aside and these bankruptcy proceedings dismissed for failure to provide a debtor verification but it was good you notified the trustee. I think you are fine with the car and if for whatever reason the trustee ever finds out you have evidence it was purchased postfiling and was purchased from the funds you got from the new job which you notified your trustee about. So legally you have no issues there and you do not need to disclose the car to the trustee because it was postfiling. I think your bigger issue is finding out if this new job disclosure is going to create any issues for your discharge. I assume you dont have a lawyer? Maybe someone else with more experience can comment on what that means exactly at this point,Bankruptcy,dbbdedu,1,t5_2qt29
