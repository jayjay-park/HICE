34875,0,t1_cehvy76,If I rip my favorites sidebar off my MAL and operating under the assumption that favorites does not mean best as Ive certainly scored a number of productions over a few of these then we have something that looks like this Tenchi Muyo! RyoOhki Serial Experiments Lain Kino no Tabi The Beautiful World FLCL Dirty PairSixth slot would go to the Patlabor franchise Im rather looking forward to the live action television series coming this year!Id say this is a rather solid cross section of how my brain operates regarding various things here. Dirty Pair has no overarching plot so is entirely driven by the strength of the two lead characters interacting and making solidly timeless action comedy situations for them to navigate and destroy. RyoOhkis plot slips and slides tonally all over the place but is buoyed entirely by its art design team and creating elastic individuals who are enjoyable to watch interact regardless. FLCL has an airtight interaction of narrative and character writing that can be enjoyed on multiple levels. Lain zooms in on the philosophical possibilities its narrative and primary character allows for. Kino backs up to consider the philosophical possibilities out in the whole wide world and its leads navigation of it. Patlabor aims to provide everything to all people.Sounds like a swell desert island anime suitcase to me at any rate ,japaneseanimation,ceiehg1,2,t5_2siab

2934380,0,t1_co1m4s7,gt youre arbitrarily defining artistic intent as anything that causes art to be createdYeah... thats kind of the point of art. And no your shitty drawing or English homework isnt art its you just doing stuff. Though if your drawing has artistic intent youll get a better grade.Mediocre fiction is not what we measure standards by if we did then it would no longer be mediocre fiction. gt Writing doesnt require any of that eitherBut it does. This is what your missing. There is a fundamental difference between a cat video on youtube and The Great Gatsby. The fact that you consider them to be equally difficult is astounding. And if you think there IS a difference then congratulations youve now recognized artistic intent.,japaneseanimation,co1ngbc,2,t5_2siab
6487967,0,t1_czq0ps5,Smart Shounen. A good series that manages to tap into all those very simple shounenistic ideals of friendship comeradery belief etc. along with good action scenes and the characters one is bound to find in the genre but handle it all in a way that shows an understanding of the base building blocks of the story to be designed and also filtered through the experience of life. Whether its Reborns thoughtful reflection on the inescappable toxicity true to any relationship and a call to examine friendship as a more threedimensional thing. Or perhaps YuYuHakishos takedown of the kungfu movies and comic bokks that inspired the genre that proposed one would find fulfilment in physical conquest only to be populated with characters who had found the top of Mount Everest strewn with the bodies of conquerers who had come before them. Or was it Zexals incredible understanding of the basic pillars of writing that let Shin Yoshida write a love letter to Jack Kirby and the embrace of goodness and empathy in the world with complex existential questions being raised through the action of card games and an entire knockout sixth season dedicated to hammering home the most important of writing rules action is informed by character. These are the sorts of stories to which I am drawn and it makes me deeply saddened that it doesnt appear  will have any of the sort.,japaneseanimation,czqek00,3,t5_2siab
