718870,0,t1_cglh5fh,A couple of their recent mixes havent really hit the spot for me. I love their stuff from their AvalonCarnival setscame out around same time and on backwards from there but idk they have been really hit or miss for me for the last couple years. Which sucks because I fuckin love the Warriors. Easily my favorite producersdjs of all time.,breakbeat,cglzm63,1,t5_2rxac

11064797,0,t3_5xz838,Haha you made yourself a nice Giegling starterpack... Traumprinzs track Where Is Home is similar to those you listed its even right at the beginning of the This Is Not mix. I dont exactly know why you posted this in the breakbeat sub but maybe Dorisburgs Mima could be something for you? It has some nice twostep vibes I guess not that informed about British styles  Tell me what you think! Also maybe check out Leafar Legovs stuff hes one of the Giegling boys as well. Cheers!,breakbeat,dem6n97,2,t5_2rxac
