4550135,0,t3_3dd0rs,Hi Im a support main stuck in silver  and I want to climb and I know its hard playing support to climb in this low elo but I hear Zyra support is OP and good for climbing. Im sort of worried about her weaknesses ie low base stats but was wondering if she is worth picking up to climb with?What is your build path normally for Zyra? Sorc shoes before sightstone or after? I normally get mobi boots before SS in most situations  a couple wards but sorc shoes are very expensive compared to mobis. Would you ever build utilitytank support items or do you just go full AP? Also what masteries do you use? I go with  on all supportsThanks for the advice!PS I main Thresh and Bard and play many other traditional supports as well,zyramains,ct4625w,1,t5_35la7

You start out with just  warding trinket so its not even like you can ward up the place.  Just play it safe. Ward what you can and ping spam if youre getting invaded and hope your team is aware enough to follow up.I can say that other junglers especially jungle mains will probably see Zyra as a juicy target so youll deal with it a lot.

7496731,0,t3_4i1pdo,Great post thanks for your analysis. Asked you already but still very interested about your findings on the patterns behind the passive seeds spawning. You seem pretty on point in your video and Id love to know the logic behind it ,zyramains,d2uc82d,1,t5_35la7
7539061,0,t1_d2z3pe7,Well Im not really talking only about pre Im talking about relative to old Zyra. Old Zyra could set up s starting pretty early in the game with relatively little gold cost.Assuming the best case scenario that youre doing true damage to the enemy this is the comparison for a full rotation plus  plants with ulti buff New Zyra  damage Old Zyra  damageEvery which way I do the math the new Zyra comes out equal with old Zyra if new Zyra always has exactly  more plant at all times. In other words when you used to poke with  plant now you need . When you used to combo with  plants now you need . For the reliable plant combo Zyra took an  net damage nerf to the knee. That gap continues to widen with AP since you need  plants to barely surpass old Zyras AP ratio with  plants.If you count the dps loss from lower plant duration that adds up to an additional plant. So if old Zyra managed to dps somebody for full plant duration with  plants new Zyra would need  plants for full duration to break even.Just to clarify that means that new Zyra is a damage nerf at equal plants neutral at  plants and a buff at  plants in comparison to old Zyra at  plants. Its a mathematical nerf unless RNG blesses you with a wellplaced seed or two. If youre defending a zone or playing chicken its probably a buff.Basically new Zyra needs  AP and a Ludens proc to do what the old Zyra did with  AP. The difference there is that old Zyra could do it more frequently with lower W cooldown and the CDR on W in addition to the utility and hp from Rylais or the hp burn if you finished Liandrys early.,zyramains,d2z5ksf,1,t5_35la7

7679424,0,t3_4ki330,For support Zyra Increase the cooldown on her Q at level .  point in Q is currently too good is at activating seeds over a huge area and proccing Spellthiefs Edge. Also there is no punishment to using it. This makes counterplay really difficult.If the enemy tries to trample a seeds a Q will almost guarantee at least one Spellthiefs proc which is currently already worth it. Combined with  charges on W it can cost a level  opponent  of his HP just for trying to step on a seed.  If the enemy doesnt trample seeds the seeds build and Zyras zone control grows out of proportion. This makes it very difficult of the enemies to CS and engage again because Q will almost always be up and it alone can proc enough seeds to thwart an otherwise solid engage. ,zyramains,d3f3ruo,7,t5_35la7

8888321,0,t3_51vpdp,Hey glad youre picking up the best champ in the game TipsUnless youre looking to all out kill someone as fast as possible dont use two seeds at once. The cooldown is fairly long and if you use both seeds on something that doesnt instantly give you a huge advantage then youre going to find yourself gimped if the fight drags on a bit. If youre ving someone then its even more important to be able to set up several plants for the duration of the fight since every plant past the first attacking someone does  reduced damage. Autoattacking an enemy focused the plants on them so dont forget to do it. Even just on its own autoattacking between spells increases your damage by a lot all mages should do thisDont throw out your seed every time you q or e the cd on your eq is shorter than your seeds and you dont want to run out too quickly just do it when you see you can land both the spell and an auto afterwards.Throw your e from bushes its pretty slow and has a cast animation so the less time you give them to react the better.BuildsTheres a lot of options for Zyras builds and theres lots of situational reasons to switch it up. Generally though you probably want frostfanggtSightstoneLiandrysgtsorc bootsgtrylaisdefensive item. Its worth noting that depending on your elo the sightstone is optional since you can keep up decent ward coverage with your trinket. The reason to buy a sightstone isnt for vision anymore its so that you get a sweeping lens and deny enemy vision. I personally would say this is very important if your enemy wards at all since you can get away with picksobjectivesganks and so much more when they have no clue what youre doing. Rylais is a really nice item on zyra since your plants all apply the slow and it helps make you a bit less squishy but it can be delayed if you have something more important.Also remember that Zyra isnt just a support shes viable in mid lane as well. In fact Im a midtop lane Zyra only main. The build order is different on that and if youre interested I recommend checking out Melyn and Kaicys guides on the right sidebar for how to go about doing that.,zyramains,d7g911l,1,t5_35la7

9587355,0,t3_5c8qzz,Who is Zyra?For me Zyra is a control mage. With good setup and positioning a good Zyra can turn the tides of any battle. With a giant knockup and a powerful snare she has a lot of crowd control. Not to mention that she can still deal a lot of damage if built properly with the help of her plants. With careful management of her plants she can deal a lot of consistent damage without the enemies even noticing it. What roles can Zyra play and function as in a game?Currently Zyra is played as a support and midlane. She can function as a toplaner and a jungler too but it is not recommended for players new to the champion.How hard is Zyra to play?I consider Zyra a hard to play champion for first timers. Shes hard to pick up but not that hard to master. Her Q and E have different ranges are considered slow and you have to predict your opponents movements to hit them. Not to mention the management of the seed charges and when to make use of the passive.What is her Skill Floor? How accessible is Zyra to players to pick up?If you dont pay attention to Zyras plants shes not so hard to play. She has powerful AoE spells and CC but she would be missing a lot of damage from her plants.What is her Skill Ceiling? What is the perfect level of play Zyra can reach?I... Dont have a good answer for this.What do Zyras abilities do?Passive  Garden of ThornsThis ability will spawn seeds at random locations around you from time to time. Most of the time these seeds will spawn too far or maybe they wont be as useful but if you can learn how to take advantage of them they can really empower your damage. Sometimes its worth using them sometimes its not.Q  Deadly SpinesIts a basic skillshot. You place the ability in range and after a short delay it will deal damage in a line spawning seeds around the ability. This ability is what makes positioning for Zyra so important since it rotates around with her. Sometimes its worth for the damage other just to make plants spawn.W  Rampant GrowthThis ability allows you to place seeds at your desired location. It allows you to store up to  seeds and it slowly creates more when you have used them.There are a few tips and tricks when using seeds but for new players as long as you can micromanage enough to make them do damage while you keep your champion safe and in range to keep throwing spells that should be enough.E  Grasping RootsA slow linear snare aoe. It roots and damages every enemy that you hit with it and it creates Vines out of seeds. Vines will slow the enemy while hitting them but they only have melee range.Some people max it first for the cdr and longer root duration but it depends on your playstyle.R  StranglethornsThis is the tool that makes Zyra the queen of disengage. Its a really big AoE ability that does damage first and after a delay knocks all enemies up. It has a short range so you might have a hard time initiating with it but its great as a followup engage or a disengage when running away.All plants that were inside the radius of the ultimate will reset get bigger and get a huge attack speed burst dealing a lot of damage to the incapacitated enemies.What runes to take on Zyra?The standard runes are Magic Penetration Marks Armor Seals Magic Resist Glyphs and Magic Penetration Quintessences. You might see some changes when you start to master the champion like mixed penetration marks ability power or movement speed quintessences Cooldown reduction glyphs Health seals... But the standard is good enough.What masteries to take on Zyra?Ill answer this later Im still testing and trying out the new masteries...What summoner spells to take?Flash is a must. Other than that it depends on your playstyle your matchup and your team composition. As a support you usually want to take Exhaust but you can take Exhaust as a midlaner too when the matchup calls for it. You can take Ignite if youre feeling confident that youll get kills in lane or you can even get Teleport or Ghost if your intention is to roam since Zyra excels at ganking lanes.What ability order to go?Its mostly RgtQgtEgtW. But some people go RgtEgtQgtW.W is always maxed out last since it doesnt really give that many benefits. Your plants might get a little bit of extra health and thats about it...What item build is most recommended?Right now most people are building Haunting Guise and Sorcerers Boots since Zyra benefits more from Magic Penetration than flat Ability Power. From that it depends on the enemy team. You can upgrade your Haunting Guise to Liandrys. You can build a Ludens if you want to poke constantly Rylais to get more health and make Liandrys hit harder against tanks Void Staff to get more raw damage Abyssal if theres too many AP enemies or Zhonyas to survive this new assassin meta...What are Zyras ability combos?Since most of Zyras damage comes from her plants you dont really have a lot of full combos to throw in. In the laning phase the most common combo is QgtWgtAuto attack. If you hit the ability the plant spawned will attack the champion as well and with your basic attack you can proc Thunderlords easily to poke.When trying to burst someone the best use of your combo is to snare someone into your ult while youre spawning plants. If its better to snare and then ult or ult and then snare it depends on the enemy champion and how mobile they are.Its tricky but its best to always throw your ability and then throw your seed instantly and not the other way around.How does Zyra need to position?Ideally Zyra wants to be in the back line throwing most of her skillshots and plants to deal the most damage and disruption while staying safe herself.However most of the time you will end up in the middle of your team behind your tanks but ahead from your carries. That is good since you have the tools to peel for your carries and help the tanks with the damage as well.If you have a Zhonyas sometimes you can even engage yourself going in the frontline. If you can activate it on time you can throw at least two plants your two skillshots and then empower these plants with your ultimate while avoiding damage within stasis. Most of the time people will ignore your plants and they will tear the enemy apart while they wait for you to become vulnerable again.Tips for laning as ZyraIf youre in the midlane focus on farming and poking from time to time. Remember that you are squishy and have no mobility so you are really weak against ganks. Ward often and dont overextend for no reason. If your opponent plays too pasively and freezes under their tower you can always do the raptors or try to roam since roaming will make them leave lane anyway.If youre a support do your best to poke without getting killed in the process. Youll always be dealing with an enemy support tanky enough to kill you if it engages you or with enough sustain to survive your poke. Focus on getting gold from your Spellthief and denying farm from the enemy. Keep the river always warded you never know what is gonna come through that jungle!What to do after laning ends?After laning ends you have to seek for objectives. Zyra is great at zone control since her plants can tear enemies from afar and lose interest on engaging. You can get Dragon towers and even Baron as long as youre with your teammates.What to do Midgame?Stay close to your teammates a lone Zyra is usually a dead Zyra. Deal damage search for objective control push and try your best to keep the jungles warded both as a support and mid.What to do Lategame?Zyra can turn the tides of every teamfight with a wellput Stranglethorns. Her root can peel and engage on enemies out of position as well as stopping tanks and assassins from diving your carries. Shes not the best at splitpushing so shes better staying with the team and providing damage and crowd control.What to do in teamfights?Do your best to make use of your passive spawn the most plants possible and use your crowd control to stop their tanks and assassins. If you can predict an enemy channeling like VelKoz or Katarinas ult ult right away since the cast time and low range of Stranglethorns is long enough to let them finish most of their damage anyway. If you have a squishy carry in range of your Q try to focus them but most of the time your focus would be simply staying alive the most time possible to keep spawning plants.Im... Tired Umarri Ill...

9699718,0,t1_da8nhb0,The idea for Double Edged Sword on Zyra is that she deals more damage than you should be taking with her so you get a lot better use out of the mastery on her.However against lanes where you are getting damaged a lot by not just the enemy ADC but the Support too like a Brand or Velkoz then you might want to avoid taking . increased damage and opt for Battle Trance because it doesnt put you at risk.I dont know if you want thoughts on DFT but I think Ill save it for later.

If theyre mobile Im probably not really dpsing long enough anyways and wont get a lot out of the ryliandrys combo. Ryliandrys is quite effective if the opponent is already prone to getting stuck in your briars but wont do much for you if they can dash out of range.,zyramains,db9fkac,1,t5_35la7
