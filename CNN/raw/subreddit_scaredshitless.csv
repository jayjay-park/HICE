653241,0,t3_21lqrc,Please do! SP experiences are fucking terrifying and also fascinating. Ive had  i can remember. One of them was that i felt the ghost of my dead father sit on the edge of my bed and tap my shoulder as if he wanted to tell me something he wanted me to pay attention to something he had to say. I was so incredibly scared that i just wanted to tell him to go away but i was too shaken to turn around to look at him or make any noise.  The second one I felt this girl climb onto my chest while i was in bed and start beating me violently as if i had deeply offended her or something. even though my eyes were obviously not open i could see her there. Almost as if my point of view was outside of my body in the middle of the room.  The thing i find most fascinating and scary about SP experiences is that my memory of them the morning after and even years after is like it actually happened in reality. Not like the memory of a dream or a drug trip where the memory has the distinct feeling of not actually being real. its fucked up stuff man,scaredshitless,cgeiugk,2,t5_2t609

2364033,0,t3_2meibu,Well I guess I will kick this round off! None I have read a few things on there but I dont find anything creepy. I will say that I have not given it a chance so not the best person to go to for an all around critique of the quality. When I was a kid I trapped this really big moth in a cup in my tree house. I went to lift the cup to see it and its head poked out. I freaked out slammed the cup down and cut its head off on accident. SoI buried it in the cup with some dirt and left it in the tree house for a month. One day I wanted to see it so I emptied the cup. The thing started to flap around and was still alive.   Fisherman  Um well a couple of weeks ago I found some strange monument made out of really large sticks that was erected to form a cone. It was Halloween Eve think it was for a bonfire. No witches or nuthin just think some kids were going to make a bonfire and party by the lake for Halloween. Um I also walked into a clearing a few years back and found a couple having sex. That was awkward for them but cool for me!  Um honestly cant say that I have had that. Probably that photo of the teenage girl that was found tied up on a bed next to some young boy. Also after watching Dahmer and seeing the back story of his victims then seeing the photos from the crime scene pretty creepy how accurate that film was. Houses in the neighborhood that are lived in by one old person or maybe somebody you just never see. My imagination always gets the best of me with those ie serial killer person has been dead for three years. Also slipping on ice and hurting myself really bad. I think I mentioned this in the last one. I had a light switch turn on in front of my eyes sounds of people walking on carpet but nobody there TVs turning on by themselves old group home I worked at. The news articles or film shorts. None of the stories I really look at see number one. Honestly I am pretty intrigued by the Native American stories about skin walkers. I worked with a lot of Ute Indians at a treatment facility some time ago and one day I joked with them and started walking around on all fours. The joke was on me because they all became extremely frightened and told me to stop. When I asked more about it they more or less stated it wasnt something they joked about. It was really creepy seeing kids almost adults with violent offenses getr scared over what our culture finds to be a ghost story. For them it was real and that spooked the shit outta me. There are sections of the amazon rain forest that have yet to be stepped on by human beings.,scaredshitless,cm3wkd2,8,t5_2t609
