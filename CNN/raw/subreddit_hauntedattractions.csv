2518489,0,t3_2ohjqp,I think surgeries are overdone. specifically surgeries that arent active and engaging. Having a doll or model on an operating table screaming or twitching isnt engaging and doesnt offer much in the way of shock value. I think chainsaws are overdone as well. Theyll scare the occasional newcomer to the world of haunts but for everyone else who makes a habit of going theyre pretty dull. You can hear them from a mile away so you know theyre coming and you know theyre dulled so they cant get you. Theres no shock to it because more often than not the operator is standing in plan sight when he pulls that chain.And zombies but I think thats going to be a consistently common answer.,hauntedattractions,cmnazkw,2,t5_2tllf
2540885,0,t3_2ohjqp,A charactereffectscene can only overused if there is no engaging storyline.  Make a story that the customers and actors can emotionally invest.  They wont be thinking about oh.... its another clown scene.... oh its another zombie.  They should be thinking this storyline rocks!,hauntedattractions,cmq8an4,1,t5_2tllf
