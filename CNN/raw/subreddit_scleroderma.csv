8889174,0,t1_d70r2fd,So just to chime in here because I am one of the rare birds that is male AND has scleroderma and am constantly doing research on it.  Your ANA is very low at .  Was it done with IFA or ELISA?  Also what are your Scl levels at?  What is the cut off for positive on your lab results.  Just so you know people can have Raynauds with other autoimmune diseases like Lupus.  Do you have GERD?  Has your doctor done a capillaroscopy? This is very important btw.  If you have Raynauds but DONT have a scleroderma pattern in your nailbed capillaries you probably dont have scleroderma.  Have you seen a scleroderma SPECIALIST?  Regular rheumatologists simply dont cut it when it comes to scleroderma.  Just so you also know scleroderma can be mild.  I have had it for  years now.  The st year sucked.  Ive been on methotrexate for  years now and am doing really well.  Still work full time and my lung function is still good.  I get pulmoinary function tests every  months.  ,scleroderma,d7gcpr2,2,t5_2xt2m
