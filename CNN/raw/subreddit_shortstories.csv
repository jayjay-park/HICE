953595,0,t1_chck7zo,He thought of all he had accomplished. Thousands of words dozens of novels. An empire could fall at his pen. He cracked his knuckles and began to write.He had always written by hand but the invention of the typewriter and computer made it seem silly to go back to such oldfashioned methods.But that was the problem wasnt it? Wasnt that the reason all this had happened? He never intended it to but he had lost all the sensibilities he had when writing by hand. Now the process was arduous hands plagued with blisters from a lack of practice.,shortstories,chcok2b,3,t5_2qhmi

1679590,0,t1_cjqs0pl,The story idea is intriguing and I like the time period you set it in. Have you had a chance to go through and apply any edits yourself?  Your posts subject line describes the character as a fat fifth grader but theres only hints right now. You may want to consider being more direct in addressing it.  In all it reads rough to me. The syntax also felt off.  I was was distracted a lot by the punctuation used in many of the sentences  the commas especially.  I also feel like you wanted it to read as conversational but I often had to reread segments to understanding what the narrator was saying. Perhaps try rewriting the passage and leave out as many adjectives and adverbs as possible. If an outline is a skeleton think of this as putting in the organs and muscles.  It can help you figure out the shape of your story. Then when those are all in place you can add the features adjectives adverbs that flatter the shape. ,shortstories,cjqvi44,1,t5_2qhmi

4262981,0,t1_cs5zzgf,Thats kind of what Im going for. Im trying to make it funny but I want it to be a serious scifi story.gtYour protagonist is at various times a  year old vice president of a Fortune  company a gym rat a highly successful corporate lawyer an electrical engineer the worlds most athletic intelligent handsome bravest fashionforward man to walk the earth. Plus he drives a Tesla on Tuesdays.I didnt mean to make him seem like a corporate lawyer. I was saying that he had wanted to do IP law as a kid but then his thoughts just wandered during that monologue in his head. Hes actually slightly based off my cousin who is an electrical engineer by education and a VP of a Fortune  company at age .Also what I meant by most athletic and intelligent was that he was the most athletic person for such a high level of intelligence.I didnt know how to approach how the US would use him. I understand its a weak plot point but what could he actually do for them? He could fight for them in the War of  Vietnam Iraq and Afghanistan but to what purpose? The only war that had resounding consequences was probably Vietnam but a win on the USs part wouldnt have stopped communism. I guess it could possibly stop the formation of Al Qaeda but probably not.I could make the government demand that he help America win every war and conflict so that they can become the only superpower but that seems too stereotypical.Regardless of what his mission for the United States is I dont think hes going to end up as one of their super soldiers. I planned on him insulating himself due to living through the deaths of many of his friends and loved ones. He then ends up traveling and is convinced to become an alchemist to find the elixir of life so that he can resurrect his loved ones or keep his new loved ones alive. After that hell run into a few mishaps and be regarded as a god in Rome or some other major society. Hell maybe give up and go rogue probably start assassinating whomever for money and hed begin to change history to his liking. Probably some conflict with the four other Immortal men. Theyll get back to  and their will be no time machine facility and hell probably try to kill himself.,shortstories,cs65mtv,3,t5_2qhmi

5038745,0,t3_3jwazq,I quite enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the use of she and how that tied in with the title. It seemed like overuse at first but then quickly became a device that really tied it all together nicely.In all really nicely done.For what its worth I liked the intro. It gave us an idea of what this persons life is now and making the reader do some catchup to work out what is going on is no bad thing. It makes us more invested in who the characters are.Im not sure about Canada but in here Australia the media never talk about HOW someone suicides. In any case I would probably lose the sentence She had shot herself as I think its a bit too explainy. I think the following sentence starting Her suicide... is enough to let us know what happened and is more newslike.Great first effort though. Keep writing!,shortstories,cutcyvy,1,t5_2qhmi

The only critique I have is the slight repetition. You used the word hellfire three times in six sentences though that could be just me. I try to come up with different words that have the same meaning perhaps ebony or onyx for the cane and I would say something more existential for the revolver something like engraved with animated torment hinting it could have been chiselled using a certain characters bones.As I said though this is a great beginning in its own right and your group is lucky to have an imaginative GM good on you!,shortstories,cyw9wti,3,t5_2qhmi

6769300,0,t3_48f3oq,What an interesting concept! This was a nice piece even with the short length. Opening with the spacers log and then finishing with the reality of an office job was a nice juxtaposition. I wonder though if the piece as a whole might not be stronger if you blended the two together. So begin with a few lines from the spacers log then follow with the alarm clock. More spacer log lines etc. so that the two are woven together. Just a thought ,shortstories,d0jkx6m,2,t5_2qhmi

10301128,0,t3_5nec2w,I like how the main character is just playing with the Nazis by throwing tomatoes and fleeing. It reminded me of Bugs Bunny trolling Elmer Fudd. One similarity in both these cases are Elmer and the Nazis have gun power but fail to use it because theyre too busy getting trolled. The ending was pretty good. The character was truly a monster hunter. I could imagine this as part of a fantasy storyline The young monster hunter started out by throwing tomatoes at soldiers now hes throwing grenades at monsters!Thanks for sharing your story.,shortstories,dcbosqh,2,t5_2qhmi
