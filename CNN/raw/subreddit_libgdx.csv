1234392,0,t1_ci8cvkm,That worked for getting the properties.  I was looking at the object hierarchy in the wrong order.At least I did it privately instead on a massively public web site ... ,libgdx,ci8hi9e,1,t5_2unus
1345217,0,t3_2310f1,Nice game However you appear to have the same issue as me when you cancel Google Play sign in the message Unknown issue with Google Play services. which is rather undesirable.I have been looking at this off and on for a while and havent found a solution has anyone else got this problem or even better a solution?I kind of hide it by only starting sign in when the user presses a login button so they are more intent on doing so and less inclined to cancel.,libgdx,cikyb88,1,t5_2unus
1502084,0,t1_cj4er2x,The point im trying to make is that the drawn graphics should have nothing to do with the game logic you might think that it will save memory or make thing simpler  but it wont.Pixel for game logic translate horribly and it doesnt scale!You can generate the graphics from the logic data but there should be no more connection.If the characters cant go on multiple zlevels so there are no tunnels than the z value can be reduced to increased movement cost and that goes for all the  data you should strive to reduce it to the minimum amount you can.Also remember Civilizations the tiles are HUGE there you only have couple of dozen of them in a map and the graphics have little to do with the gameplays tiles.This might by a good article for you  ,libgdx,cj4k612,3,t5_2unus

1766252,0,t3_2emzz6,Thanks for your helpinterest guys.I solved the problem by setting a TextureFilter to my skin. I am a little confused that I have to set the filter for every drawable texture. If anybody knows how I can apply a TextureFilter to a whole TextureRegion I would be very happy.EDIT Even though I only applied the filter to the play button in the not pressed state everything else gets rendered correctly too. Does anybody know why?If anyone is interested in the code,libgdx,ck1siyj,1,t5_2unus
1951416,0,t3_2h0d5j,So you basically want to do this  create a bullet object at the ships position move the bullet each frame by a certain amount check if the bullet is now offscreen and if so remove the bullet. The simplest way of doin this will e something like this on my phone so the formatting may be a mess p    public class Bullet           public Vector position       public float velocity           Public Bullet                  position  new Vector           velocity  f or whatever                  public void update                   position.y  velocity            Then in your level class you would need an array of all the bullets currently in the game like    ArrayltBulletgt bulletsThen each render call you can use the iterator of the array to loop through all the bullets like this    forIteratorltBulletgt itr  bullets.iterator itr.hasNext           Bullet b  itr.next          b.update          ifb.position.y gt Gdx.graphics.getHeight               itr.remove          Then when the ship fires a bullet just do    Bullet b  new Bullet    b.position.set ships position         bullets.addbThis is assuming that you havent transformed the screen at all such as zooming or scrolling. If so youll need to account for that when you check the bullet in the level class.Hope that can point you in the right direction! EDIT formatting,libgdx,ckockwp,3,t5_2unus
1958108,0,t3_2h3gev,try run it from command line and then you can see the error causing it to crash. What my first guess would be is a problem with loading assetsjava jar ltjarfilenamegt.jar,libgdx,ckp5kjz,7,t5_2unus

3704897,0,t3_32sxep,If you dont really like Unitys drag and drop interface go for libgdx all the way Moreover it uses Java which you already know while Unity uses CJavascript. C is quite similar but it has some differences you might not be aware of compared to Java.I tried them both and Unity is pretty cool to work with but I always get the impression thats its doing too much under the hood. Plus most of the tools are for D games.In the end your choice ! Pick what you feel most confortable with.,libgdx,cqel028,5,t5_2unus

4265248,0,t1_cs65s06,Thanks. I got the bodies and the joint revolute to work. All guess work from AS syntax and some trial and error. But I am still not able to moverotate the bodyhandle on mouse movetouch as happens in that tutorial the handle follows the mouse movement. I have no idea how they did it in the tutorial guess also because it uses an older API?.,libgdx,cs6eto7,1,t5_2unus

5805086,0,t3_3up2ok,You shouldnt care anymore about x devices. Most phones are now at the minimum of x. Just make your camera that size and use a viewport. Now just design all of your assets for x and use a filter on them so they will look the same scaled up.Scaling down in game will most of the time result in bad performance,libgdx,cxgoc4k,2,t5_2unus

7042935,0,t3_4c13dn,I literally just ran into this. You MUST implement resize to resize your viewport. Its called on resume and even creating a whole new viewport in the resume method wont fix it. ,libgdx,d1eo9ra,5,t5_2unus
7060534,0,t1_d1gmuzs,how does a camera work? so say I have an orthographic camera. I now have a camera looking at the screen correct? but where is it looking? also how do we determine how much is it looking at? also do I need another camera to look at tiled maps or spritesAlso I did check those out but I often have questions and it sucks when you are just reading and you cant ask questions.,libgdx,d1go7i3,1,t5_2unus
7397732,0,t1_d2io369, That is a really good idea  Ive played this game a lot obviously and I still send troops to my own base accidentally more than Id like. I think we will look to implement this. Thanks! You can play the tutorial again from the main screen though I think a lot of people tell us they dont realise this not sure how we could make it more obvious without having text saying tutorial or something. As to reading about the devs etc its not there for two reasons  laziness and not wanting to have more buttons than absolutely necessary on the home screen. Possibly something well review in future. Its a hobby for which we give limited time and so well probably end up prioritising other stuff ahead of it.Thanks again for your feedback.,libgdx,d2j2nkh,1,t5_2unus
8346998,0,t3_4twayx,If you havent already it helps to read the articles Fix your time step  and the LibGDX flavor  as well. This explains how to lock the physics update process to a separate time interval using an accumulator and feeding the accumulated time into the step. This technique can also be used in your instance by creating constant values for collisionUpdateRate physicsUpdateRate and whatever you might want to limit to something less than the speed of the update. ,libgdx,d5kxewe,8,t5_2unus

8753414,0,t3_4zyju8,It sounds like you want to make a multisprite body using a skeleton of some kind. Im imagining something like the big guys at the end of NES games like castle Vania.The answer is math. You have to figure out how to place each sprite connected to your joints then rotate the joints to make the skeleton move. If I were going to do this I would make a skeleton class where I can define joints and appendages and have methods to rotate them that automatically move the other related sprites.,libgdx,d6zu1da,1,t5_2unus
