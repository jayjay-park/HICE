5304221,0,t3_3nm4pt,Im about  sure its based on how much time you spend in a particular area of the map during the laning phase first  minutes of the game. I actually dont determine the role I get that from riot.Its usually pretty accurate but it can be off if you if you spend time roaming in and out of your lane. Nice KDA btw.,bluebaron,cvpocn6,4,t5_3a49c
