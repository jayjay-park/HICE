However this principle is not exclusive to carbon. You could apply it to other atoms in a similar matter but it can flip. e.g. BH hydrogen is more electronegative so H and B.Not sure what you mean by mask that specific fact.

Water or KOH can even act catalytically here as it is regenerated after the elimination and can be deprotonated by KOtBu again.Next time you should take care to use dry solvents and more difficulty dry KOtBu.

413029,0,t3_1yrfq3,The half reaction you have isnt done correctly and you need to think about the oxidation states some more.Assign oxidation states first then go into balancing each species in a half reaction.What are the oxidation states of the Mn and O in MnO?  It is a balanced molecule yes but each atom in there has a charge and you need to know what it is.  Elemental oxygen O will be zero but oxygen in a molecule will not be.Once you have figured out all those oxidation states then go ahead and write the half reactions.  Your professor added in some information about balancing with water and acid or base media but you should not need any of that for this reaction.  You can balance the equation just with the atoms present and adding in a couple extra e on the appropriate sides.For an example to work from Ill throw in some WRONG NUMBERS.  Dont copy this directly.Mn on the left has  charge.  Mn in MnO has  charge.  Therefore to start the half reactionMn gt MnAdd in electrons to make it balanceMn gt Mn  eIn this scenario the oxygen would have a zero charge on the left and  charge each on the right soO gt O  then O  e gt OPut your half reactions together so that the number of extra electrons on each side balance and you are good to go.Follow this process with the correct oxidation states and you should get a good answer.,chemhelp,cfnkr8w,1,t5_2s6e6

They use a very fine point attached to a fancy leaver force magnifiers and sensorsactuators to describe the surface of an object to atom level.  To my eyes the STM pictures even show the bubbles in space time pushed into existence by atoms.  Your electrons seem to be invisible in these pictures great example!Electron microscopes work by exciting space time as a light bulb does but more like a laser sending a highly directed wave in space time at the target.  The reflected waves are picked up by the sensor and imaged.  Electrons are still not needed except to put a name to the microscope.Magnetism and electricity is not something I have looked at much with this theory but conventional theories already struggle to explain this.  Let me give it a try every time I do it seems to make even more sense magnetism is a swirl or coil in the flow of parts of space time around an object that causes such a swirl be it a permanent magnet or electromagnet.  This also is how electricity would be transmitted in the very unlikely event that this theory turns out to have weight.  Certain types of atoms seem to have a propensity to interact with space time allowing us to harness magnets and electricity and see their effects in real time.  Other atoms seem to insulate transmissions of certain types of signals.In the large hadron collider when we see a collision and the spirals associated with destruction of particles into smaller particles this is a good picture of space time drawing the pattern of decay and pushing particles out of vision and existence by integrating them as part of space time again.,chemhelp,chbqdib,0,t5_2s6e6

1086879,0,t1_chrtwpv,ampampamp Bernoullis principle sfw gtgtIn fluid dynamics Bernoullis principle states that for an inviscid flow an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid potential energy   The principle is named after Daniel Bernoulli who published it in his book Hydrodynamica in . gtBernoullis principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow resulting in what is loosely denoted as Bernoullis equation. In fact there are different forms of the Bernoulli equation for different types of flow. The simple form of Bernoullis principle is valid for incompressible flows e.g. most liquid flows and also for compressible flows e.g. gases moving at low Mach numbers usually less than .. More advanced forms may in some cases be applied to compressible flows at higher Mach numbers see the derivations of the Bernoulli equation.gtBernoullis principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy This states that in a steady flow the sum of all forms of mechanical energy in a fluid along a streamline is the same at all points on that streamline. This requires that the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy remain constant. Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs proportionately with an increase in both its dynamic pressure and kinetic energy and a decrease in its static pressure and potential energy If the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir the sum of all forms of energy is the same on all streamlines because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume the sum of pressure and gravitational potential gh is the same everywhere. gtBernoullis principle can also be derived directly from Newtons nd law If a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure then there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume accelerating it along the streamline.   gtFluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure and if its speed decreases it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently within a fluid flowing horizontally the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest. gtgtImage i  A flow of air into a venturi meter.

Firstly the bond between your substrate and the leaving group breaks to leave behind a positively charged cation. This step is slow and rate determining and the rate only depends on the concentration of your substrate.To use this example the Br is your leaving group and the rate determining step is the breaking of the CBr bond to leave RC and Br .The next step in an SN reaction is an attack of a nucleophile in this case water on the positively charged cation  this is very fast so the concentration of the nucleophile doesnt matter.An SN reaction is different in this case the nucleophile this time it is Br  attacks first causing the CCl bond to break in concert note  you do not get a pentavalent carbon as an intermediate  it has three bonds to the R groups and two partial bonds to the leaving group and the nucleophile. The likelihood of this attack depends on both the concentrations of the substrate and the nucleophile hence the .Another important thing about SN reactions is that the nucleophile attacks from behind the CX bond seeing as that is where the lobe of the antibonding orbital into which it must dump its electrons lies  but thats probably going a bit too deep for the moment.,chemhelp,ckxed43,2,t5_2s6e6

2293151,0,t1_clv4kzx,Thanks.Note that the first two are good rules. No exceptions at least within the scope of common chemistry. And they are fairly simple and very useful. Hm you may occasionally find an insoluble Li salt. If you have been given the rule thats fine.  And if you stumble on the insolubility of LiPO someday so be it.Note that the first rule helps with the last two. The rules for sulfate and hydroxide are messy. But all alkali metal salts are soluble  and that includes these.The third rule Cl etc can be simplified some. Its halides in general  except F. That is we can make a pattern there tho not a perfect one.That leads to another little pattern. F there is special. And I hinted above that Li might be a bit special. Youll find that period  doesnt always do what you expect.Another little mess... Although group I salts are rather well behaved all soluble group II can play games with you. For sulfate they are more soluble at the top of the group. For hydroxides they are more soluble at the bottom. The trends in group II with those two anions are opposite! If nothing else it is a clue that solubility is more complex than we suggest at the start.A few of the sulfates may be familiar which can help you sort thru that rule. CaSO is gypsum or plaster of Paris. Insoluble. BaSO is the stuff they give people for stomach xrays. Ba is very toxic yet they give BaSO to people orally. Why? Cuz it is so insoluble you dont really get any. On the other hand MgSO is Epsom salts used for soaking your feet. Soluble.In the real world it is easy to look up solubilities when you need them.

Now reactions always go to equilibrium.  So since its running to the right the reaction doesnt have enough products and its making more to reach equilibrium.

Because there are  d orbitals and the general rule is that you have the maximum parallel spins before you pair up with those  d electrons theres  unpaired electrons and  paired. If it loses  of those paired electrons then itll have  unpaired electrons in an orbital each or in terms of oxidation state thats Fe with the configuration Ar d.With the rest of your question I actually dont quite know whats going on.

You can tell these by the structure of aspartate. Knowing that you are raising the pH from  to . you can assess the change in charge. At pH  only the alpha carboxyl is deprotonated we know this because gt. we also know that under these acidic conditions both the side chain carboxyl and the alpha amino are protonated because their Pkas gt . The net charge on the aa is  because of the  charge on the alpha carboxyl the  on the alpha amino and the neutral charge on the side chain carboxyl. Raising the pH to . will deprotonate both carboxyl groups on aspartate but not the alpha amino group which requires a pH of . or higher to begin deprotonating it. The new net charge can now be calculated for aspartate under these conditions by adding the charges on the groups  from the alpha carboxyl  from the side chain carboxyl and  from the alpha amino. . The charge on aspartate under pH . will be  and the charge will have changed by . You have  of them in the peptide so thats .

6367094,0,t1_czcsfe9,Okay so Ill walk you through NaCl. Ill refer to this siteNaCl  . so that means each atom in the NaCl unit cell has a coordination of . If you look at the unit cell diagram of NaCl you have the center atom either Na or Cl depending on the diagram and  direct neighbors of the other atom. If you have a picture of the unit cell then you can probably skip this step and just visually confirm whats going on in the unit cell.Looking at this picture bYou can deduce that there are  Na and  Cl just as youve said. Now it all comes down to math. The volume of a cube is given by s where s is the length of a side. When talking about crystallography we use a to denote the side s and it is called the lattice constant. So the total volume of the unit cell atoms  empty space is equal to a. From Wikipedia I get that the lattice constant for NaCl to be .pm or .   cm. I put the value into cm because wikipedia also has a value for the density of the NaCl unit cell So a  .   cm. I also look up the mass of Cl .   g and Na .   g and multiply both values by  for the  atoms of Na and Cl in the cell. I then add both values together and get a total mass of .   grams. So finally we know the equation for density is MV so we substitute our values and get a value of . gcm which is close enough to the Wiki value of ..Hope that helps. ,chemhelp,czdda6m,1,t5_2s6e6

6716853,0,t3_47j71l,I would not expect there to be a generally predictable relationship between the extinction coefficients of a strong field and weak field ligand at a given wavelength. Changing the ligand is going to pretty vastly change your absorbance profile. If you initially optimize absorbance for the weak field dd then it seems unlikely that you would have an overlapping dd in the strong field and wouldnt see much of an absorbance. You could also see a CT there and see a much larger absorbance instead. More or less you can predict where your dd band might migrate but all of the other bands are trickier.The primary factor in determining molar extinction coefficients is usually the type of transition e.g. dd or CT.There should be a weak correlation between the size of an anion and the molar extinction coefficient due to the wider area to intercept photons but the size considerations are probably small as compared to the electronics end of things.,chemhelp,d0e2x0b,1,t5_2s6e6

Id imagine that were the data available that tetramethylpentane would be still more stable.Generally  CH bonds are stronger than  or  CH bonds so maximizing the number of methyl groups and minimizing the number of  CH bonds leads to more stable isomers.

Because each mass corresponds to a mixture of unknown ratios there are too many variables to solve the ratios.

Where it gets confusing is this the high EN element is the oxidizing agent because it is the reason something else with a lower EN is oxidized the low EN element is the reducing agent because it is the reason something else with a higher EN is reduced.However I think I found an answer From what I can tell I think the pH of the cell is a major reason that zinc although a higher EN is being oxidized. Another reason to look at it is the oxidation numbers of zinc and manganese. Zinc starts with oxidation number of zero while manganese starts with oxidation number of . Thus it is extremely favorable for manganese to force out zincs electrons reducing manganeses oxidation number. Sure zinc is now at zinc II but at least manganese IV went to manganese III. You chop some heads off so some kids can see the morrow.This is why labs will write oxidizers on chemical safety warnings  high oxidation numbers basically means anything can reduce it because of how unstable they are which leads to really exothermic reactions  boom.Corresponding to what Wikipedia has I think you set up the cell as if it had zinc chloride solution. Which makes sense since I would classify the ammonium chloride cell as more acidic cell ammonium can only donate a proton it cannot act as a base.If you want more help understanding how the battery works I can try my best.
