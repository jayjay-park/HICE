11277337,0,t3_60xq9c,First off be excellent to each other. This first month is super hard no matter how much help you have and working together is critical to making it fun beautiful and not a complete shitshow. months is a long time. And being away from your newborn isnt really fair for a young dad. Its your kid too! The family help would be amazing for those first few weeks but its also important to learn how to parent on your own and to build those bonds while the baby is still very young. You dont want to feel alienated from the parenting experience when things are still forming.Our original plan was to have my wifes mom come out a day after the birth and stay for at least  weeks. I was psyched about this extra help experience someone to pick up the slack when I go back to work after a week or so. I work from home so its a little different. My MIL sadly fell and hurt herself just before the birth and couldnt come out right away. When she did she only stayed a week and could barely help. This forced us to really dig in and do it ourselves. I was more nervous than my wife but we made it happen. Its honestly better off his way because were confident parents independent of other peoples views on child rearing and were equals minus breast feeding.Id tell your wife to take the first month there but then ask family to come to you for a week. And also stress the importance of independence and learning as a couple and how important it is to you to be fully present for those first months.edit some words,Fatherhood,dfa9pzp,6,t5_2qmjs
