9779880,0,t3_5f9ib4,I am  years old and in June I weighed in at  pounds. I had a wake up call. Joined a gym have a trainer once a week for an hour. Go to the gym every other day. Drinking lots of water got rid of sodas. But I do enjoy a drink or two on the weekends. I have learned that you can still have sweets but in moderation. If you know you are going out to eat Go to the gym that day. Eating small healthy snacks every  hours helps. It is now November and I have lost  pounds! You can do it! It will be hard at first but I promise you it will get way easier. ,Weightloss_everything,dail2pu,3,t5_2ux4n

10346289,0,t3_5o2icv,Honestly you just have to change your habits What I do is when its easy to eat healthy  I do it. This is typically breakfast lunch and dinner Monday  Friday when Im working. Theres less temptation. You just have to think  or  meals in advance so you have enough for left overs and dont get caught off guardMy usual weekday looks like thisBreakfast Jimmy Dean egg white and turkey sausage breakfast sandwichLunch veggies  cup of rice  oz protein salmon patty ground turkey whatever was left over from last nightSnack protein shake slice of cheese and lunch meat Greek yogurt or fruits and veggiesDinner i usually see what protein is on sale at the grocery store and revolve a meal around that. i.e. Carne asada and low carb tortillas with avocado and pico de gallo chicken and veggies and rice taco salad etcWhenever you go out and try to minimize this try to order a level or two healthier than you normally would. Like if I want a burger and fries Ill get my burger wrapped in lettuce and get a small fry insteadAll these things become habits. Make sure you drink lots of water. I find it easier to drink from at least  oz water bottles that have straws. Try making exercise fun. Go on a nature walk go window shopping etcFind healthy substitutes and get used to them  most are acquired tastes lol. Like cauliflower instead of potatoes water instead of other drinks veggies instead of other carbs ,Weightloss_everything,dcgt7o8,1,t5_2ux4n

You are a guy so imagine if someone ripped out your testicles reattached then and smashed them with a sledge hammer because that is the equivalent of cramps,Weightloss_everything,dcmq3xa,1,t5_2ux4n
