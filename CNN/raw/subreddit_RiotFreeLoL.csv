3743661,0,t1_cqiq3pp,I wouldnt even call that a style... The question is. Do we seek good League or entertaining League. I understand the feeling of many that thE EU LCS has been super entertaining this split expecially thanks to UoL but I do not see them progressing EU as a region or LoL as a game. There is nothing to learn from them at best they sometimes bring out some odd pick and show the region that this might work. I prefer teams that focus on the strategical aspect of LoL expecially since for spectators who mostly cant just copy the mechanical aspect this is much more relevant. ,RiotFreeLoL,cqj0392,1,t5_37lih

Seriously many of the offensive items have defensive components  Zhonyas BT Shield Bork Slow qss does Dmg when finished Maw crit multipliers that add movement speed for some reason Ludens has  more movement speed oh and you have a flash! If youre a midlaner who can no longer oneshot everyone in less than a full cycle of abilities let me play the worlds smallest violin for you.The problem isnt cinderhulk or skirmishers or weird playstyles.The problem is ADCs are too strong early the top lane champions get stomped down as soon as they are relevant TP is too good to pass up in terms of xp loss gank potential and magic damage is too high.  When smite skirmishers cinderhulk is finally overnerfed top laners will retreat to ignite which means you will lose  of your health full dmgbuild mages adcs to one summoner spell.

4069896,0,t1_crk6sy4,i dont think most sports contracts have a changing your voice stipulation specifically because of the fact that most sports have players associations that protect them their images and their rights as players.  while sports can use their players for marketing they cannot alter a comment to change the context that which it was made to suit an agenda.  You have to remember that athletes in all sports are represented not just by their players association but their agents who in most cases are lawyers making a substantial fee to protect their client.  esports players are not afforded the same luxury.  thats a fantastic question. i dont think it changed the way we approached any topic.  i do think going into the whole interview we were definitely a bit nervous not to come across as too much one way or the other but prior to recording we all talked a bit were put at ease he said everything is in bounds and we just went for it.  Richard knows what he wants to say and like me loves to talk a lot of the things he said we werent fully aware of or they were put in a different perspective that we hadnt thought about other things i think we definitely saw eye to eye on and some things i may agree with but my co host might not which was the case on a couple of topics.  Were recording a show today that should be up on tuesday kind of exploring a bit of what went down in the interview and touching on a few things people have asked us since.Thanks for listening supporting and becoming part of the discussion!  We love being able to talk with you guys about this stuff!  TLDR  i dont think changing voices is standard in other sports i think using their voice and image is but their message is protected by the players associations and their agents.  I dont think having richard on changed how we view anything.,RiotFreeLoL,crk728s,1,t5_37lih

4423456,0,t1_cso9k60, Players control certain aspects of their behavior but when a system is designed with flaws that drive people crazy for years then I cant blame the players just the poor design of the system that sets players up to rage. If you knew you were going into a game  games in a row with  chance of winning you blame Riot the system covers up this by hiding the data that would show the flaws in it and this why people rage blaming other players instead of Riot. Its a good way to avoid the Rage being directed at the company responsible for creating the system. I am not asking to make an VOip system I agree with you but it does cause you too be over run by a premade group of  using VOip which causes anger at your team mates. I think Riot does a poor job in all aspects of policing the verbal chat system first the pre game chat is recorded but not used in the Reporting system. Second they do not allow you remove the chat option out of the game only reduce it size you can be reported for not communicating with team mates but they never make this clear using smart ping enough communication? Do you have type into chat what your flash timing are to be a good team mate never really explained. I do not believe in freedom of speech when it comes to a gaming environment that has a large age range should an eight year old boy be exposed to people  years old talking about life as they see it? Probably not in most cases it would be a very bad idea. If I was a parent and my son and I were playing and someone start spamming racist remarks and my son joined in I would have to set him straight on how to handle that communication better including removing his ability to play the game if needed. Riot can do a better job of managing in game chat.,RiotFreeLoL,cso9qnl,1,t5_37lih
4480075,0,t1_csvd09q,Forgive me if Im wrong here but I dont remember RL ever saying that Riot did influence or control rLoL only that there was potential for said influence and abuse. And I noticed you are fine with RL but not with Riot as if to say RL isnt in the same position? He used to use reddit to promote his work you know.. But Riot arent allowed to do that? Why? What about all the other game devs that do it? There are many.. And the other companies? there are even more of them. Im unsure whether youre under impression only Riot as a company is on reddit.,RiotFreeLoL,csvdq8f,2,t5_37lih

4840500,0,t1_cu4nq9g,Yeah pretty much this.  The LCS thrives off of drama.  Rioters try to build up as much drama as possible and also spout off the most stupid shit at times just to force some drama.  The LoL subreddit almost always has some sort of drama going on as well.  The community loves to explode things out of proportion.Riot already realized that the NA and EU scenes have no real chance at international competition so they just focus on storytelling and building up drama in order to draw people to it.   And it works.   ,RiotFreeLoL,cu4old7,2,t5_37lih

6323718,0,t3_419b6a,Detest Riot and consider them eerie and Orwellian and whatnot but thisgtScriptshacking  The ostensible purpose of this rule is to make it so nobody knows that there are ways to cheat in league but pretty much everyone knows at this point and if not Google can certainly point you in the right direction. Again this is another rule to prevent Riot from being exposed and criticized on the sub.I disagree with. Everyone knows what chemical and biological weapons are. Should we allow people to disseminate the recipes to them everywhere? Print them in the newspapers on buses put ads all over the internet? No. The point is freedom of expressiondiscussion is important but there are limits. Freely talking about scripting simply mathematically increases the amount of people who will go out and get scripts. Scripts ruin the game for everyone who isnt scripting and I believe its in  Riots best interest to stop scripting but thats another debate.,RiotFreeLoL,cz8frud,1,t5_37lih
