46782,0,t3_1uj05v,Here are some additional ideas for incentives other than speed to upgrade your device. I know wallpapers were mentioned but maybe some of these would be good additions rearrange icons? icon packs? loading animation change for different devices? maybe with customizable text? if a notes app is added maybe make it more feature rich as you get a better device? add a camera so you can have a profile picture on your phone maybe in the my device area maybe this could get changed as well  if youre worried about people abusing this maybe be able to select one of a collection of predefined pictures.,HackEx,cejr928,1,t5_2znpk

153374,0,t1_cevvnru,The money in HackEx is never ending. There will always be a revolving door of people to allow spam to be uploaded too as well as people who leave to create mule accounts.I do hope some form of inactive players bot is used to help with the mules tho.,HackEx,cevwfs8,2,t5_2znpk
171367,0,t1_cexy843,Mine did not this morning P And besides developers should have this check in place regardless to prevent people from using older clients that may still have bugsholes in them that could be used later.,HackEx,cexy9ch,3,t5_2znpk
174208,0,t1_cey7cpc,The game doesnt use an IP address. It uses a UID. Displaying a name doesnt just the functionality in anyway. You dont have to use it for anything. Just show it. Perhaps as a smaller font lighter color label next to the address ,HackEx,cey9xfa,1,t5_2znpk
179404,0,t3_1w5bus,This sounds like a sync issue. I do believe doing a scan and hack causes a process update. But really this is just an update issue. At least I think,HackEx,ceyvb04,2,t5_2znpk

273506,0,t3_1x8ozz,So if I hack a user I would have to download his wallpaper first? Heh never thought huge wallpaper could help deter attack Joking aside this would require the server storing users wallpaper. Thats way larger than the current storage requirement levels apps spams those would be less than KB I think.Or.... you mean a wallpaper only you can see? Extract the APK change the wallpaper repack. This can also be added officially to the game without much overhead after all players with client before . wont see the wallpaper of Nexus S device.Layout... that one should be possible without adding much overhead to the server but I dont really see the need for it I mean its just  icons in one screen its not a big deal. Hackers visiting a user would also see the new layout that would confuse them for  seconds. Also considering the layout is pretty dynamic maybe its possible to modify the APK yourself.,HackEx,cf93zkr,3,t5_2znpk

550551,0,t3_2091h9,So basically you ruined the game for him. No offense but once you reach the max stuff the game becomes less fun IMO. Its nice to have challenge and that vertical progression. Imagine starting the game new and not having that moment of Finally enough for the next device! And new wallpapers! because you were already maxed out?,HackEx,cg2ur3l,3,t5_2znpk

10016203,0,t1_d7u5az9,You dont need a bypasser hack the API is kinda dumb you dont have to have hacked in to someones account to change the log. They just iterate the  million ids and put it on every account. Takes a long time tho the server is slow.,HackEx,dbd51rj,1,t5_2znpk
