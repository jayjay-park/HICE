Just be sure to take an easier class as your third class that quarter and you should be ok. Dont be scared of multiple science classes at the same time.

2559018,0,t3_2p0n6m,I cant say that will be an easy quarter but its doable. The courseload by itself is fine depending on how PHYS  is thats the only one I havent taken. Youll be dedicating a fair amount of time to your studies but if you can structure your time properly youll be fine. Of course the amount of time youll need to give your classes will vary depending on your success as a student. Whether thats worth it to you is up to you to judge.Im generally a proponent of maxing out credits but I also know that Im probably an edge case. In my case Im graduating with two degrees in four years just barely and had I not maxed out on credits my first year here more than one degree wouldnt even have been a consideration. So my personal advice is to go for that load. Worst come worst just drop a class and take it another time.As for working parttime it depends on what the job is. I probably wouldnt recommend anything beyond  hours a week unless its something rather enjoyable meets another need e.g. socializing or you can also burn through some homework during it i.e. sufficient downtime. If the employment is flexible again Id say take it on and cut back if necessary.Sorry for the wall of text and feel free to ask further questions.  tldr Go for it but be ready to cut stuff out of your schedule.

Things like graduate student unionization Ive been told that negotiations have been going well funding living conditions graduate and undergraduate culturesall matter.Each program is different. Smaller cohorts are going to feel a lot like family especially if your field of study overlaps.Living conditions are going to vary on where you choose to live.If you want something quiet avoid living in the u district. I lived in Wedgwood and bused in to campus. A few PhD friends of mine lived in free same area or even further out.I cant speak too much on culture...because having lived here my whole life I had the luxury of being a commuter and still having a social life with people outside of school. However there were plenty of opportunities to bond with the cohort.gtIn terms of the city beyond where to move what are some good places to retreat to? Whats daynightlife like for someone in their mids? Best cafes to do work in and bum out in?Seattle is fantastic for hiking biking boating running climbing etc. If youre an outdoor enthusiast youre in the right place.Reminder marijuana is legal in Washington if thats your thing youre set. It is still illegal to smoke it on campus.The crowd around the university ave tends to be younger students. Id suggest checking out Ballard Ravenna or Fremont for great bars with a different crowd.

5001477,0,t1_cunvhp5,Registering for classes depends on your class standing in regards to credits. So lets say you came in with a bunch of AP credits and you have sophomore class standing you will be able to register ahead of all your friends by a registration period usually about a week. So having credits coming into college can be helpful and hurtful. It can be hurtful in the aspect of if you have too many credit and dont have a declared major then UW can put an academic hold on your registration. Usually you just need to talk to an advisor and they can waive that hold but had a few friends who had the holds. So it usually starts with graduating seniors seniors juniors sophomores and then freshman registration. It is over two days and cant remember how you can tell which day you will be on think it might be based on the last few numbers of your student id number. Yes it will remind you on MyUW so dont worry. And yes registration especially as an underclassman is HELL.

When you come to the IMA just take the lock from the basket and then use it on one of the lockers right by the baskets where you can keep your backpack and clothes. Unlike the baskets these big lockers are not meant to be locked long term though. I am not sure if they will get removed overnight. You are also not supposed to use your own locks AFAIK.

10238724,0,t3_5mheyq,Economics is probably NOT what you think it is. Economics is philosophy it is social theory it is art but it is also heavily reliant on advanced mathematics. If you dont have what it takes to get a BA in mathematics here then you probably dont have what it takes to practice economics proper.Applied economics is different. This is mostly data analysis and is strictly empirical. This is like working for Amazon or Starbucks as a data analyst or in some cases as a financial analyst. This also requires mathematics but not as much. It requires a lot more programming skills than economics graduate school though. It also requires a knowledge of statistics but so does graduate school.Is there nothing else you can do with an economics degree? No there is. But this is what youre primarily competing for. If you dont like math find it difficult to understand I would recommend selecting a different major.,udub,dc4m7ki,2,t5_2razk

An exception to this is if the receipt shows tip s then Id assume tips are definitely favored and thats when I feel obligated to give something. This is personal preference after all but as a general rule of thumb for me . if its a fast food restaurant like Jimmy Johns or Subway then no tips.. If theyre within a  mile radius of campus and are charging gt per plate then no tip. . If theyre operated by HFS Cultivate LocalPoint no tip.. If the food was bad the waitstaff didnt seem to care was rude no tip.In all other cases tip.,udub,dgo03gr,5,t5_2razk
