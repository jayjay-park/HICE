3746,0,t1_ceejxu4,Organix imo is a poor choice. I dont have any experience with Say Yes To but when I used Organix it dried my hair out and made it feel like straw. Organix products contain silicones which do all kinds of bad things to your hair.I recommend using Suave Naturals Conditioner if you can find it. Its only  per bottle and it definitely does the job of cowashing and detangling. If your hair is sensitive to protein then dont use the Coconut one but all others are fair game. Im partial to Everlasting Sunshine myself.Try to cut out silicones from your styling products as well I guarantee youll see a big difference!gtI dont understand cowashing though.Simplified Load up your hair with conditioner. It should feel kinda like seaweed. Use the pads of your fingers as opposed to fingernails to rub your scalp and clean off any product buildupresidue dry skin dirt whatevers up there. Spend as much time as you need on your scalp  minutes even thats really the key to cowashing.With conditioner still in your hair gently comb out any tangles with your fingers or a widetooth comb. Try to get the conditioner all the way from the roots to the ends. Rinse as much as you see fit. I leave a little conditioner in or I just add some more after rinsing.Theres an excellent rundown here too,curlyhair,ceev49z,2,t5_2t79l

50197,0,t3_1uhyv9,I used to use those Herbal Essences products when I first began trying out the Curly Girl method but I found that HE products tend to dry out my hair and make it stiff. I ditched their products once I decided to use only crueltyfree and allnatural items. Ive used the Pampering Conditioner and the Color Protection line for awhile. It was okay it did what it said but I felt like after a couple of months the effects waned. For the past  months Ive been using the SheaMoisture Coconut amp Hibiscus line and alternate the conditioner with the Deep Treatment Masque. These products have been the best thing for my hair. It makes my hair soft gets rid of tangles made my hair healthier and regain my curl shape I got keratin treatment for almost  years and I lost some of the shape and volume to my curls. Bonus its crueltyfree allnatural and the line goes on sale often at Target CVS and Walgreens.For reference I have a mix of bc hair with medium texture and high porosity. As others have stated everyones hair will react differently to the same products so try as many products as you can. It can get frustrating but its worth it in the end when you finally figure out the routine and products that work best for your hair. Good luck amp have fun ,curlyhair,cek58jl,1,t5_2t79l

217437,0,t3_1wlofc,CG isnt for everyone. You could be allergic to the ingredients in the conditioners you are using you probably arent cleansing your scalp properly or enough. Dandruff is a sign that your scalp is NOT happy right now and if you ignore this you could start losing hair. Whatever you are doing now is not working so you need to switch up your routine and probably use a dandruff shampoo until the problem is fixed.

627847,0,t1_cgbjzda,The Matrix So Silver shampoo has ammonium laureth sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate  both known to be very harsh basically one step below sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. Here is a list of harsh and safer sulfates Your hair feeling instantly tangled makes me think that its the protein content of your conditioners thats bothering your hair. I noticed that all of your conditioners have proteins in them. Here is a list of some common proteins. Usually you can identify them by the words hydrolized amino acids or protein obviously!. It seems like you could have overloaded your hair with protein. I would suggest trying something simple like Tresemme Naturals Moisturizing Conditioner. Its protein free and very moisturizing. See if your hair has a similar reaction to the Tresemme Naturals. This list also marks off which conditioners have protein and which do not if you want to try some other options. Or if you have access to a Sallys check out their knockoff of Matrix Biolages conditioning balm its really moisturizing and great.On the other hand color treated hair does need some protein to counteract the damage so dont rule out protein in the long run. My guess is you need to get some good proteinfree moisture into your hair with some deep treatments. Once your hair no longer feels as tangled you can try using a conditioner with protein every once in a while and see how your hair reacts. If you want to look into some more details about protein check out these articles . Sciencey Hair Blog on Deep Treatments . Sciencey Hair Blog on Protein and .

709359,0,t3_224im8,Conditioner is okay but there are some much better methods to protect hair. You could putting coconut oil in the hair which will absorb into the cuticle and coat the hair strands creating a barrier to the water. Also saturating the hair in water before you go swimming will stop the pool water from being absorbed as easily as the hair has already absorbed. I know a lot of people use conditioner but I just think that surely it will all wash out quite quickly? Also it will just get into the pool. I personally find oil I use coconut to be the best method. If you are doing a lot of swimming then making sure to do some deep conditions and hair masks just to make sure your hair is in the best shape will also help. I wrote a blog post on this a few days ago if you want some more ideas       its more for chlorine based swimming but should still be useful ,curlyhair,cgkwo6p,2,t5_2t79l

How can I get it back?Your hair CAN return to its former glory as long as its treated right. Try a few things before you consider chopping it all off.. Deep condition your hair you can use a regular conditioner for this try to apply it to damp hair and apply heat to help it sink in. It could be as simple as a plastic shower cap trapping your body heat ingood wrapping it in a warm towelbetter or using a blow dryer with a hood attachmentbest. Leave it in as long as possible then rinse.. Protein treatment. Try adding a protein treatment to your hair to replace lost proteins that naturally occur in hair. It also helps strengthen your fried strands. Homemade protein treatments work you can google this OR you can buy them from the store. Sally beauty Supply and Ulta have some great options just ask them.. Get a trim. Sometimes a light trimming of the ends can revamp those lovely curls. You may not have to do a BCBig Chop and lose all of your length.Hopefully one of these tips will help you!,curlyhair,cj51t41,1,t5_2t79l

2265795,0,t3_2l5cbk,Yall its normal. For everyone worrying you lose something like  hairs a day. When you dont brush your hair between showers those hairs get stuck in your hair and well as end up everywhere else you travel. Sure a few of you may be thinning but the wide majority is just not brushing those hairs out  times a day into your brush. And if you arent washing your hair every day or cowashing or whatever you will lose the majority in the shower when you wash and comb.Also be aware that when you switch to a method that defines your curls and you lose the frizz it can feel like your hair is thinning or thinner. While hair texture changes for a lot of people several points in their lives simply defining your curls and getting a curly girl cut can make it feel like youve thinned instead of maintained and managed your curls.,curlyhair,clrrt0b,69,t5_2t79l

3822340,0,t1_cqrvm78,well there are lots of schools of thought on this but what works for ME is to avoid any product that has sulfates in it look for ingredients ending in fate or silicones in it look for ingredients that end in cone cane or xane. silicones generally arent water soluble which means  they build up unless washed away with a sulfate and  the buildup can make hair sticky which can make it dull from dust and debris. and the sulfates required to wash the silicones and other nonwatersoluble ingredients away are harsh and drying. so i use stuff that contains neither so i can stay out of that cycle. i personally like devacurl products but there are lots of products that fit the bill. heres a list from another forum im on. its a little out of date so you should always read ingredient labels because the manufacturers reformulate but its a good startTry any flavor of Suave Naturals as a cowash product or any VO fruity or flowery conditioner. Cheap but good and easy to find. LOreal EverCreme Cleansing Conditioner and SheaMoisture Organic Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo are very mild lowpoos that are also very moisturizing.

4023892,0,t1_cret2x6,Since my hair is really damaged colortreated regularly plus straightening for years the first thing I do is a protein treatment. Some people are sensitive to protein so YMMV but Im not so its helped restore my hair health and prevent breakage. Anyway after the protein treatment is when I do the deep conditioningmasque treatment. I slop it all over my wet hair saturating it from root to tip... to the point where Im concerned it will be way too much and I see the whiteness and am concerned it will all drip off. My hair is literally gooshy and thick with the masque. I then twist it into a clip put a shower cap over it all then a wool beanie over the top to keep it all contained. The beanie over the shower cap is to keep heat in since I dont have a genuine hairheater.   I do this once a week and I leave the masque on as long as I can tolerate it  anywhere from  hours depending on what Im doing that evening. The directions say roughly  an hour but yeah since my hair is a hot mess and doesnt absorb very well lowporosity I leave it on way longer. One thing Ive learned is that I cant leave it on overnight. When I used silicone masques it was OK but not with this one. I did it once by mistake just fell asleep reading and after washing it out the next morning my hair was way more dry and crispy than normal. After some trial and error I found out that I need to wash it out while my hair is still damp at the very least.  Hope this helps! If you want any more pointers on masques feel free to ask... even though Im only recently CG Ive been using various masques and treatments for years because of all the styling Ive done.

Some cones are watersoluble and can wash right out but the most common ones in conditioners dont and require sulfate shampoos to get rid of them.The only time I use cones now is if Im straightening since it takes a lot to control the frizz and Ill be washing all the products out afterwards anyway.

4351045,0,t3_3au2vr,It may have something to do with the fact that your conditioner has silicones in it. Once you start shampooing more infrequently conditionerwashing alone wont strip that gunk out of your hair. This leads to heavy and frizzy hair with less definition.If you want to wean yourself off shampoo make sure you arent using any silicones. Also dont sleep with your hair wet or damp. I saw you mention it in another comment but it will lead to  nothing but more frizz and a lot of breakage. Try plopping for only  minutes instead of a half hour and make sure the fabric is smooth so it doesnt disturb the hair cuticle. When using a diffuser dont turn your hair upside down or flip at all. Find your natural part tip your head to the side and direct the diffuser at your head at a perpendicular angle for four minutes on each side. Then come at the curls from below for  seconds at a time. This will also reduce frizz while giving you some volume.,curlyhair,csg3foz,6,t5_2t79l

If they do I would try using proteinfree products for a while and see if your hair texture changes. If your products do not contain protein your hair might need more moisture.

4446745,0,t3_3bys1x,Hmmm. Thinking back to what I struggled with when I moved from Virginia to the Beach Cities in SoCal...is the water harder where you are now? You can usually look up municipality water reports and compare the hardness between your old home and your new. You can also look at whether the sink fixturesshower glass have hard water stains. If the water is harder then the minerals are building up on your hair too. Shower filters dont really affect hard minerals. I think a house watersoftener is the only full solution. Im a renter so I know what a crappyuntenable solution that is.If you want to test this you can try either just rinsing your hair with distilled water at the end of your shower or go allout and do your whole washconditionrinse routine with distilled water once or twice. If it does make a difference you will want to look into using a chelating shampoo occasionally Ion Hard Water Shampoo gets recommended a lot I think you can find it at Sally Beauty.

My hair isnt the biggest fan of it and it makes me feel really dry and stringy.Maybe see what happens when you eliminate the SheaMoisture smoothie? If its still super frizzy or dried out id try switching the conditioner next. It could be protein or aloe sensitivity... or maybe even just that the conditioners youre using arent moisturizing enough even though youre using a bunch of it.

4781017,0,t1_cttmudb,I wash every day also and found that alternating between sulfatefree shampoo and a siliconefree conditioner cowashing worked well to keep my hair from becoming too dry. As time has gone on Ive been able to introduce more and more cowashing cutting down on shampoo almost completely. This method also helped me to avoid the dreaded transition period where your roots look greasy for a few weeks. Using silicones isnt necessarily a bad thing if your hair likes them but in general its better to avoid them since sulfatefree shampoos will not get them out of your hair. It most likely wont happen immediately but you may experience buildup over time. If you do really want to use them though clarify afterwards. But keep in mind that clarifying sulfates sorta work against what youre using the mask for in the first place. My hair loves proteins so I cant recommend anything specific but heres a few links I found of people asking about proteinfree deep conditioners. Hopefully they can help!   ,curlyhair,ctx6rn4,1,t5_2t79l

4789894,0,t3_3gh6n3,Ive mostly been using SheaMo deep conditioners... all of them are supposed to be colorsafe. My favorite so far is the Raw Shea Butter with Superfruit being my second. Another I like although far more expensive is Davines Vegetarian Miracle. My hair literally feels like butter afterwards.  The fluffiness should calm down to being more manageable now that youve washed the cones out and once your hair restores its natural ph balance. Depending on the severity of damage that can take anywhere from  days to  weeks and then there will be a bit of transition for your wavescurls to start clumping together again. Postbleachcolor I dont change my rinseout conditioner leavein or stylers Ive been coloring my hair for years so theyre already fine. However I do change my deep conditioning regimen. I use them a few times a week for the first month sometimes even sleeping with them in then scale back to just once a week for maintenance. YMMV if your hair isnt as trashed as mine is though  Do keep in mind that bright unnatural colors are gonna fade no matter what. Red is known as being the toughest to deposit and one of the easiest to fade. To minimize fading wash your hair as little as you can get away with. Make sure that whenever you get your hair wet its using as cold of a temperature as you can tolerate. And of course no more sulfates. For the eventual touchup Id recommend these brands theyve lasted the longest for me Special Effects or Pravana Vivids. SE will stain the crap out of everything for a few weeks as it bleeds so take care with wet hair. ,curlyhair,ctyazvh,1,t5_2t79l

4808245,0,t1_ctz8tek,While I agree with  of this advice based on the history of straightening and recurling I am guessing there is quite a bit of heat damage. This means your hair would be high porosity for now and I would recomend conditioners and stylers with protein. If that isnt an option a protein treatment could do wonders. I say high porosity for now because as your hair grows out and you avoid the straightener the stuff coming out of your head will be healthier and maybe low porosity.

I saw your pic below ahhh... curlies with short hair can often have trouble with plopping. What you could do instead is use a tshirt or microfiber towel to scrunch your hair as dry as possible then clip up the roots and let it finish by air drying. I really recommend clipping for those of us with fine andor thin hair it really helps with volume at our crown and to give more of a curly texture at our roots. Heres a couple methodsDuckbill clips   Roller jaw clamps   I use a modification of roller jaw clamping. I have one giant octopus clip that I pull the hair at my crown into and I let all of my hair airdry before releasing it. I cant speak much to pillows honestly.

Also check the products link on the sidebar As for starting the Curly Girl method the overview in the sidebar is actually pretty great  The main things are to avoid sulfates in your shampoo and cones in your conditioners and styling products. Wash your hair with cone free conditioner instead of shampoo. Leave a little conditioner in the ends of your hair. Squeeze the water out with a tshirt instead of drying with a towel. Use gel for more definition. Air dry when you can.For me...the Curly Girl method took a LONG time to get used to. My hair felt heavy and weird because I was used to stripping it with sulfate shampoo. It LOOKED better but felt dirty on my head  it wasnt dirty it just wasnt stripped of all moisture. It was an adjustment in attitude for me. Also if I use ANYTHING with cones in it it makes my hair feel gross and greasy at the scalp and very dry and crispy on the ends. So I have to watch out carefully for that.,curlyhair,cv6wt4x,1,t5_2t79l

The picture of your hair up there looks like what my hair would look like if I didnt put any styling products in so we might have similar hair. Just make sure your hair is soaking wet when you try to put gel in it again scrunch it in from the bottom up tips to root and you will likely need to use more than just a quarter size to get good coverage. I sort of do it in handfuls of sections and each section needs about a quarter sized amount of gel. The light defining gel should not leave your hair sticky and it should feel soft and wonderful after you scrunch out the crunch. Layering gel over the SM smoothie was the second lifechanging moment for me and my curls. If you do get a gel and the smoothie try just using the smoothie and try over a couple of days with using different amounts. Same goes for the gel  try it alone first use different amounts see what happens. Then see what happens when you layer them. I think something will end up working out!!,curlyhair,cvd4v5i,2,t5_2t79l

5220978,0,t3_3mid04,I know this isnt exactly helpful but can you reschedule your appointment to a weekend? The whole thing about a Deva Cut is that you go in productfree with your curls airdried naturally. Any disruption to them via products hair clips etc changes how they lay and could impact your stylists ability to cut them correctly. That said you should check with your stylist. IIRC Ouidad cuts hair wet and prefers their clients come in with their hair styled as it normally would be so they can assess the after look immediately. Your stylist could be officially Deva but also skilled in Ouidadlike methods as well. An alternative I just thought of it may not be the most practical though depending on your job. Could you plop your productfree curls and then pull a beany or a hat over them and wear that throughout the day? After work you can release it all and it should hopefully dry before your appointment. ,curlyhair,cvfbill,4,t5_2t79l

5247282,0,t3_3mv5oz,Pick an inshower conditioner that you like and can afford to buy in bulk! You probably wont need to shampoo her hair every single bath but you do want to apply conditioner each time. liberally. dont towel dry it since that promotes tangles just wrap an old tshirt around her hair and press lightly to soak up the drips. curly hair should be practically tanglefree by the end of each bath so if youre not starting with really smooth sopping wet hair everything after is gonna be way harder than it has to be.    get a great detangling spray. I just googled best detangling spray curly hair and scan for one in your price range with good reviews from real humans. Use it anytime youre going to combbrush her hair. No tools on dry hair ever!    Stick to a nice wide tooth comb or something like a wet brush if you find it helps. Spray her hair spray the comb douse the whole room in detangling spray or leavein conditioner before you touch her hair with a comb or brush.    If youre staring down a total rats nest first thing in the morning or after the pool or something pick up all her hair at the nape of her neck like youd do to tie a low ponytail then spray and comb just from your hand to the ends of her hair. itll relieve the pulling on her scalp and let you tackle the worst of the knots less painfully. the same is true of parting her hair down the middle and taking on one side at a time.    also put it in a braid for bedtime to make it easier on yourself in the mornings. cant braid or dont feel like it? just use a few ponytail holders spaced out along a low ponytail s style. you got this mama!,curlyhair,cvihiow,5,t5_2t79l

5272387,0,t1_cvlcxam,if you havent tried a wet brush like those i linked i wholeheartedly recommend one. they have really helped my sister manage her youngest kiddos totally baby fine curly tangles. if you tried this kind of brush already just trust that the brush is the wrong tool and its not user error at all and move on!  id definitely try my damnedest to find a stylist who is great with curly hair and kids. this is like the hope diamond of hair stylists for sure and im not saying itd be cheap or necessarily someone within a  mile radius. but it really sounds like that could help. id avoid completely any sort of chaincheapie haircut emporium and id ask no matter where i took her for someone who is extremely patient and great at hearing your concerns.  maybe tying her hair is painful because the ponytails are tight? i dont know and kids will pick any reason to complain if they dont like something but maybe try a low loose ponytail with a soft fabric scrunchie. itd still help mitigate the worst of the knots and might be less repulsive to her.  id for sure try a different detangling spray if whatever you use now isnt making it easier to combbrush her hair. i have no hard facts but i feel like the ones marketed tofor kids have less helpful ingredients and more nasty stuff in them. try a johnson amp johnson a paul mitchell or maybe a curlykids one? you can kind of finger comb it in just a tiny bit to help sort out the hair before you combbrush.    and cut back on the shampoo if you use it the pic below of her hair when dry definitely looks like it could use more moisture and shampoos are pretty drying. lots of curly folks go without a shampoo for weeks on end using only conditioner. condition her hair  or  times in a row in the tub until you can get your hand or a wide tooth comb easily through her hair.  i know its a challenge and kids rarely make anything simpler but there is a routine that will work for you guys im positive. dont give up!,curlyhair,cvlluud,1,t5_2t79l

Bend forward to flip all of your hair over and pile it in the center of the shirt. Grab the bottom left corner of the shirt in your left hand the bottom right corner on your right hand and wrap them around to the back of your head to meet each other. So now you have the bottom edge of the shirt wrapped around your head  across your forehead and around the back. Take one hand to reach forward and pull the top part of the Tshirt around the top of your head so now the sleeves are draped over the back of your head. Grab the left sleeve in your left hand and the right sleeve in your right hand and stretch them around the sides of your head to the front and tie them together. Tada!

I have always had extremely thick dense hair. From the ages of four until twelve or so my hair was pretty much straight and a triangle because my mom thought that a blunt cut and lots of brushing would make it more manageable. It wasnt until I hit puberty that my hair started to get really curlywavy. Since then it has taken a ton of time and effort to convince my mom that curly hair is healthy and acceptable. At first she wouldnt buy me any sort of styling products because she thought they were what was causing my damaged just curly hair. It was during this period that I learned a lot of DIY stuff how to use stuff I already had at home to replace storebought products and how to do protective styles plopping etc. Im  now and while I still cant afforddont have access to a lot of nicer hair products I feel I have a good handle on hair care considering I had to teach it all to myself using the Internet and experimentation. it actually might even be a blessing in disguise because I save money and I dont have to worry about chemicals damaging my hair.

5674308,0,t1_cwxw456,I had to give up on finding a salon that straight up does curly cuts as they should be. Either the cuts are  which is completely ridiculous in my city no matter how good you are or they cut dry in the most assbackwards way possible that shreds my hair to ribbons. I suggest going to Yelp looking up high rated salons in the area first and searching for curl curly curls on each page for reviews. But also do the same on some of the smaller less well rated places just in case.If in the event you dont find anyone else that can do a Deva or a curly cut to your standards I might be able to help you communicate to someone doing a wet cut how to keep the curls looking nice. Ive had to learn to do so.When I first went to my current and lovely wonderful patient stylist I flat out told her everything not to do and that I knew would fuck up my curls. So no to all the basic anticurl things like razors and texturizers but also no to blunt ends I have to have some slight point cutting to get my curls to coil nice and having the back be shorter than the front since its looser in the back. Basically anything about your own hair that is relevant to the cut. Also you should absolutely tell them to not have any tension or use very little to prevent losing a lot of length when your curls shrink into shape. When theyre pulling the hair to cut they should be dragging the fingers to the cutting line and kind of bouncing their fingers down a teeny bit to let the hair go lax before chopping.,curlyhair,cx0gct9,2,t5_2t79l

Id have to see what your hair looks like now but Ill assume youre a level  so to lighten your hair to at least an orange stage youd need to use  volume developer at a minimum. You can try lightening the hair over two stages taking a week break or two in between to condition and repair. However theres no way to completely avoid damage. Like AGhostLP said why not try pink over your hair as it is now? Youll still get pink tone without the damage. ,curlyhair,cx623wr,1,t5_2t79l

I watched several videos for cowashes looked through the Holy Grail list a few more times searched on Amazon CurlMart etc and finally settled on trying out the EDEN BodyWorks Coconut Shea Cleansing CoWash  I bought it at Sallys the other day and used it that night.  I like it a lot nice subtle smell and very silky feeling.  I still had a lot of hair come out in the shower but hopefully with a few more washes thatll reduce to a more normal level.  I think it helped with my frizz a little but not as much as Id like. Since so many people seems to recommend it for frizz control last night I ended up buying SheaMoisture Coconut amp Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie at Walgreens.  Luckily they only had a small travel size available because the smell was horrible! Too sweet a sickly sweet smell that made my stomach turn and I ended up washing my hair again last night to get the smell out. I think it did help more with frizz than other products Ive used but I cant get past that smell.Ive tried leaveins styling creams gels oils all of which left my hair either too stiff or a strange residue in my hair that was very offputting to me especially gels.  However Im going to give these another go and see if I find a product that blends in well and makes it virtually impossible to tell its in my hair. Any recommendations here? Mainly just wanting one product thatll blend in amazingly and help with frizz.

The best way to combat it is to do an apple cider vinegar rinse. Fill a spray bottle mostly full with ACV you can also add a few drops of tea tree oil or peppermint oil and get your hair wet. Spray it all over your scalp then massage it in with your fingertips like you would when youre cowashing. Leave the ACV in for half an hour and then rinse it out. It shouldnt leave a smell and it will make your scalp feel so much better. I do it pretty regularly and it has basically eradicated my scalp problems. Its also great because ACV is a natural conditioner so if your problem actually is dry scalp it will help that. ,curlyhair,cxtmcya,7,t5_2t79l

6936012,0,t1_d12hq47,Copied from my first commentFrom what I understand stereotyping a culture to make fun of them which is what youre describing is less cultural appropriation and more..well racism. But dressing in tradition garb of a different culture to experience theirs is not appropriating at all! As long as one approaches the situation with respect and willingness to learn I dont see what the big deal is. Even on Halloween its clear when a costume is meant to be caricatural and deeming but I see no issue with a well thought out costume of a Geisha or intricate Day of the Dead makeup. I mean after all Halloween is all about being someone youre not for the night! But mostly Im seeing things like how gay men stole black womens culture with regards to certain ways of speakinggestures. How white menwomen shouldnt rap because theyre appropriating rap culture which belongs to black people etc. Or how only Mexican people should wear Day of the Dead makeup and if you dont overtly look Mexican then youre appropriating Mexican culture. You can only wear dreads if youre black etc. And to me this is all very stupid. Culture is meant to be shared. People arent meant to live in boxes and never put a toe out of their cultural line. If we did we wouldnt have the amazing melding of cultures we have now! I know many cultures and so many foods wouldnt exist if people never left where they were born and didnt bother to explore the world and spread knowledge and their culture. As this point one culture no longer owns a certain type of hairstyle or food because its been melded over centuries of intermingling. Im Indian and I can tell you religious people in India have been wearing dreads for THOUSANDS of years before it became a thing in Jamaica. It would be silly to argue that in fact Indians own dreads and no one else should be allowed to have dreads! Or insist that Caribbean people can no longer eat their style of curry because explorers brought spices to the East Indies from India. Curry is a huge part of the Caribbean culture just as it is mine. I cant deny their culture any more than mine simply because its a derivative of mine. I guess I wont ever understand. As an Indian Im always super happy to see people taking an interest in my culture. Ive never been offended by people wearing saris and bindis and I encourage people to try new things. But thank you for taking the time to respond and read my point of view! Youre awesome ,curlyhair,d12ivee,6,t5_2t79l

6958165,0,t3_4b07wp,The sulfate freesilicone thing doesnt necessarily work for everyone in the same way and the goal here is really to learn about your hair and what it needs to be its healthiest.    Its just like figuring out the right diet for your body and the right skincare routine!  Youll have to figure out how often your hair needs to be cleansed if it likes protein what kind of oils and moisturizing products it likes.  Im maybe a A as well and my hair is super thick with natural volume.  The number one game changer for me was realizing how much moisture and products my hair really needed and that my hair is protein sensitive. So the first three immediate things. Stop using shampoo every day. Use your regular conditioner as a leave in and youll probably have to use way more than you would think you should.. Use a t shirt or microfiber towel to blot and squeeze out excess water from your hair NEVER USE A NORMAL TOWEL AGAIN.  I use a low sulfate shampoo maybe once every few days a normal shampoo that pretends to be moisturizing but has sulfates to clarify every few weeks I add avocado oil or castor oil over my hair before I do this and cowash my hair just about daily because I just need to.  To a non curly haired person I use a shocking amount of conditioner as a leave in.  How much you need will really depend on how thick your hair is.   My current favorite conditioner is Yes to carrots but I alternate between that and the Herbal essence smooth collection conditioner. Its ten bucks and I have only found it at target.   Super into the kinky curly gel and the coconut hibiscus mousse from shea moisture. When I started out I too thought I thought expensive products were better.  Now I just cringe when I think of how much I spent on trying to find stuff that worked for me. Oh also for me growing it out was very important. I was like you I had it really long and then became overwhelmed by it and would cut it short but I need that length to help weigh my hair down.  I actually have way more control over it when its longer.,curlyhair,d151j6i,4,t5_2t79l
6971449,0,t3_4b228t,When you recolored with henna did you do all over applications or just the roots? Henna layers on the hair which makes it more difficult for moisture to penetrate the hair and will eventually cause curls to relax and straighten out. With henna from my understanding the only solution is patience and slowly trimming off the hennaed hair or doing a big chop and starting fresh. Also Ive found that its really difficult to get an even distribution of spray products. Id suggest switching out the spray conditioner and start using a gel to offer more curl hold using the palms of your hands to evenly distribute the product. ,curlyhair,d16juk2,2,t5_2t79l

7025500,0,t1_d1cd1w2,Youre welcome! I bleached my hair to hell last year so Ive got a lot of trialanderror experience in the proteinkeratin area    If youre already doing protein treatments every other week you might be overloading yourself having proteins in your regular products as well. You could try cutting down the frequency of the protein mask or try switching up your current products. If your hair isnt damaged by bleach or coloring Id say just cut down the masks first and see if that helps. Try once a month instead. That way at least youll get more use from the products you already have while you test things out.  Also on the subject of silicones... they Dimethicone mostly can coat your hair strands and not allow other products to absorb correctly. Using the Cantu leavein first may be adversely affecting your hairs ability to take in other products that are applied afterwards. That might be why your hair gets oily after you apply the creme its not absorbing? Id recommend cutting out the leavein and see if your other products are more effective afterwards. I leave some of my shower conditioner in my hair in lieu of a leavein these days and it seems to be better for my fineandthin hair.  ,curlyhair,d1coyvt,2,t5_2t79l

7140938,0,t1_d1ppxdz,To start off in the shower I just wet my hair enough to soak it. I wont vigourously go at it since you want to keep your locks from the moment you start your shower and because you dont want to scrub all the natural oils off your hair. I dont use shampoo at all. Some people here use stuff call nopoo which I might if I find my scalp getting to itchy but otherwise I just condition with this This is something I can get off the shelf at Safeway or Walmart. I use previously using a generic Head amp Shoulders conditioner which could get me good results sometimes but it wouldnt be consistent. This one has no silicates which is something thats important. You could use any conditioner that is siliconecate free I think.To condition I put the conditioner in my hands and spread it out. Then I put in in my hair both right side up focusing on the ends and also upside down also focusing on the ends. Ill get a bit through the rest of the hair after putting most of it at the ends. I will have my hair parted the way I style it postshower and it will essentially mostly remain with that part until my next shower. After that I dont touch my hair until I wash the conditioner our. You want to leave the hair in those locks and let them form even while in the shower. When I was them out I wash it out maybe like  so that a little bit remains.Post shower I towel dry no time or effort for blow drying. I use a microfiber towel used to use a terrycloth which was decent enough but also inconsistent and will essentially like slick my hair back with it. I wont scrub back and forth but rather move it only in one direction. If you do that you should notice that it kinda forces your hair into locks which is a good thing. This is an important step to keep locks without having to blow dry or wait  hours for the hair to air dry. The slicking shouldnt break the part assuming you want to style by parting.After getting it less wet the technique makes it very hard to get it anything close to somewhat dry and doing other postshower stuff I get some product this is what I use found everywhere get a decent amount in my hands spread it around and then put it in my hair like I did the conditioner focus on the ends and do it partly upside down. After that I slick it back using only the flats of my hands no finger combing so that all of my hair gets product on it I find when I dont slick some part of my hair can get frizzy. Finally while my hair is still slicked back I will spray it with this spray also found in supermarket shelves about  times or so and then against using flats of my hands I will kind of slick it back over my hair to get it to cover everything so that I dont get frizzy.After all of that I just delicately and carefully pull my hair back forward out of the slick and style it the way I want trying not to break the curls. When its styled I dont touch it for  hours until its dry. Then head upside down I push up on the curls to scrunch them which will remove any hardness from the hair and give it volume and really let the curls stand out.This was a longass writeup but it really is a simple routine. From the start of my shower to after spraying and styling my hair it only takes me about  minutes including the time of the actual shower. No blow drying no plopping no  products no deep conditioning nothing like that. This is what I can get after that short routine. Its extra tough for me to style too since I have a crappy hairline something not all but most girls dont have to worry about. And I had to rush this morning as I was sort of late. As I mentioned before you can get better curls than me for sure but it would take a lot more effort time and money.You could make a few changes from my routine since your hair is shorter and appears curlier. First of all the upside down hanging would be different since your hair isnt as long and wouldnt hang as low. Still do it when conditioning but you could probably skip it when applying product but still make sure not to rake product through your hair and instead scrunch it in and slick it over the top so as not to break the curls. Upside down hair styling makes the hair curlier something you might not want at such a short length. You also may or may not want to part your hair since it wouldnt really hang off either side of your head. What I did when my hair was shorter is after slicking it back Id kind of push it all forward in one motion. It would promote curls without destroying them. I cant really do that now with longer hair since my hair has to fall somewhere. You totally could though.If you have any questions at all about the routine feel free to ask. For products its not like I tried a whole bunch or anything. The conditioner was the first silicatefree one I saw on the shelves at the store. The hair product I bought on a whim randomly and after learning from this subreddit was the only one I had without a ton of dimethicone. The spray I just bought on a whim too. Didnt even know if I was going to need it. You dont have to buy what I did is what Im saying. Just stay away from the silcs.

7343497,0,t3_4fupsm,I get way more attention when I straighten my hair but I think thats because Im mixed race and having very long straight hair which doesnt look artificially straightened makes me look racially ambiguous in a striking way. I get lots of questions about my race when I straighten my hair that dont really come up when its curly. I also think some people may find it more attractive for whatever reason and those particular people might be inclined to take me seriously for that reason. However I feel so much less confident when my hair is straight. Im more worried about how I look whether Im going to get frizzies or flyaways the weather and how long my blow out will last. My hair is pretty thin which is much more obvious when its straight so Im more selfconscious. I touch and fix my hair more a huge nono with my curls and probably look more nervous. At this point i know how to make my curls look sleek shiny and put together without changing the curl pattern and so I dont worry about looking professional when its natural.

7486462,0,t3_4hwz9f,I wore extensions for years and i really wouldnt reccomend. I hate to be a party pooper haha but sew ins really damaged my hair. My hair is fine also and the gravitational pull of having them ripped my hair out. Also your own hair can get really dry underneath and the upkeep can be a nightmare your hair can start to smell musky and damp if the underneath braids arent fully washed and dried which is really hard to do as the extensions are in the way I have used glue sew ins clip ins and wigs and i would reccomend using a wig or clip ins purely because they cause less damage. Also that way you can wash and maintain your own hair whilst using them. That is just me though lol i am sure people have had better experiences! I guess just the once wouldnt cause too much long term damage but i really wouldnt reccomend getting into a habit of it. I got into a really bad cycle of wanting length and thickness and therefore turning to extensions without realising it was actually counteractive as it was making my own hair thinner and shorter!

7707039,0,t3_4kvqmg,I finally got a good routine for my hair Ill share and I hope youll try it. Youre doing good so far avoid heat sulfates... one thing I noticed was you didnt mention what kind of towel you are using a normal towel will cause your hair to frizz badly I only ever use a t shirt now but a microfiber towel will work too anything that is smooth. Also it sounds like youre doing good with the shampoo but I would suggest and look it up if you need to I did a lot of research on this cause I hated my hair I put a few drops of tea tree oil in the shampoo it will keep your scalp healthy and help give it volume and massage it into the scalp for a few minutes. Then add a few drops of jojoba oil to the conditioner and use it on everything but the roots then comb it out with the conditioner in. The jojoba will help with the split ends and make your hair shiny. And once a week or more I try to sleep with coconut oil in its messy so use a shower cap. It will be hard to wash out the next morning but once its done it will literally look like you just spent a ton at a salon. If you only take one piece of advice from me have it be the coconut oil its basically a wonder drug for your hair.,curlyhair,d3i8lxs,6,t5_2t79l

Once your daughters hair is longer I would condition everyday. I do for my mixed hair. Curly hair cannot distribute oil evenly because of the coil so curly hair does not get as greasy as straighter hair and does not need to be shampooed as much.As a reference I have medium length hair a bit past my shoulders and I cowash once a week or so and only shampoo my hair once in a blue moon. I water only wash and moisturize my hair with conditioneroil almost everyday.This Dominican youtuber really helped my routine and she has a video of her routine for her son She doesnt shampoo her sons hair.I would recommend to never brush her hair dry. Not only will it most likely hurt but it leads to hair breakage. Wide tooth combs are highly praised for curly hair but some other combs are also goodOnce you have your baby and her hair starts growing you can figure out her hair type and what works for her hair  not all biracial hair will have the same coil.

Like uqueendweeb  I was straight for most of my life up until last September when I ran into a reddit post that talked about deep conditioning. My drive for a solution to my over processed and severely damaged hair kept taking me back to this thread. My hair is a little tighter than your current curls are. I learned three things in my hair journey. . Never completely rely on anyone for your optimal improvement. Only you know what is best for you. Only you will carry any project out to your desired defining goal or continue to perfect you want want it to be.. Schools and methods can easily be outdated or completely dismissed. Stylists are trained by schools that sell a product. It is a business They are in it to make money. If a  beauty school said your hair is suppose to be by brushing it out damaging your hair using salon grade products sulfate alcohol silicone filled and chemical infused products cutting it wet and straight and blow drying or flat ironing frying your hair it on your way out.  It makes you believe that is how hair is suppose to be and you need them to look your best. Not True. . Awareness is key to any self improvement. Be aware of what you are doing as well as what you have to do. Know you are going to be out in the hot sun all day. Perhaps it will benefit you to plan your hair routine to do some deep conditioning the next day. what you do when you do it  Be aware of what you use and how it reacts. I love Shea Moisture. I live in a really dry climate so I use the Manuka Honey line. I use the Shampoo once every  days and just condition cowash the rest of the days if I do wash. I love Shea Moistures Curling Gel. I scrunch all the water out get about a tablespoon of get in my hand spread it all over hands evenly then scrunch the gel in. Too much gel will take a long time to dry. It will also have the same look as you have in the photo. I like my hair to look and feel softer so I use a little less. I pineapple my hair at night I also deep condition once or twice a week. I found an awesome dome hair dryer for  at Goodwill. That thing does wonders. I found organic Argon Oil a Burlingtons Coat Factory for .

But after multiple uses with no sulfate detergent washes in between the silicones will continue to deposit on your hair strands and those deposits will build up over time.Even some CG friendly ingredients can cause buildup and many people use a clarifying i.e. sulfate detergent shampoo every once in a while to get rid of any buildup.,curlyhair,d7l500f,2,t5_2t79l

Only my newer growth curls and since my most recent dye touchup my hair only sort of waves unless its insanely humid out. Your hair is probably friend beyond complete repair.  However I have had some success giving my hair a little more curl and bounce by slowly using less shampoo after the initial dyebleach washout until Im only using shampoo every  days and only on the top of my head not rubbing it into my scalp.  The natural oils on my head have worked wonders in restoring my hair to at least  what it is naturally. I also use the Yes To Coconuts curl definer which helps my hair somewhat hold the curls it forms while in the humid bathroom after I shower.  Good luck!

9458784,0,t1_d9ac7yq,Are you treating your hair everyday? Id give a minimum of  days for the hair to rest and the treatments to settle in before any washingcowashing. Pay a lot of attention to the leave ins youre using. If those saturate your hair in oils silicon or even keratin this will do more damage than good in the long run. Hair will look stiffer right after a keratin treatment though and in the next washcowash it should be better. I dont know if keratin would decurl your hair for a longer time though. Would you feel comfortable in giving more days between shampooing? I also recommend switching to sulfate and siliconeparaffinum free products I dont think using coconut hair before showering is necessary. It is amazing to protect hair while bleaching though! This could be saturating your hair with oils so Id drop it altogether or use it whenever I noticed I hadnt used any oilbased products in the last few days. Keep heat away from hair. Specially after using oils. Usually the routine for very damaged hair is a focus on reconstruction keratin and other proteins etc but it needs to be balanced at some point with oils and moisture or the hair will look stiff and lose shine. I felt my hair moved like a playmobil hat when it had a keratin excess. And then I added an oil excess to it and the thing looked like straw.

9546586,0,t3_5bkv8b,I had Japanese straightening for years and unless you have a very experienced stylist who knows how to apply the right protective treatments before and do it in a more mild way it is very damaging.  Heres my rundown on what it was like   Not sure where you are located but good stylists for this stuff go upwards of treatment...every    months. Each treatment takes  hours or more in a salon your Saturday afternoon if you work during the week.   Once it starts growing out enough if your hair is close to curly or very curly you have to blow dry a lot to maintain it and keep retreating it. If youre hair is like type a or more curly at about  months youll start having to put in more effort to keep it straightlooking.   Japanese straightenedhair cannot be lightened with any coloring. So if youre hair is already dyed lighter or you want to not a good choice.   Japanese straightened hair does still require styling. I used to blow dry it quickly and easily with a brush    min for my fine low density shoulder length hair.   The straightened hair is so straight you wont easily be able to blow dry in waves or loose curls. Takes a gallon of hairspray and a professional to get anything to that effect and it will last only a few hours.   I had a good experience with Japanese straightening for about  or  years and then the damage started to roll in despite all of the deep conditioning masks and heat protecting products I tried. Damaged and thinned out a lot of the hair along my hairline so my forehead got bigger and my hair was SO flat.    Avoid the Japanese straightening or else youll end up in an endless loop that Im now trying to get out of...Im  months into transitioning and still have another  months to go before I can cut it again.    Its not a good option! For what you invest in the straightening you could get a very good curly hair specialized haircut for    and spend another    on travel and sample size products try Ulta Birchbox Target best for your hair type. This group see the sidebar can help you find out where to start. Try detangling only with conditioner in using a widetooth comb or your fingers in the shower. Brushing curly hair is painful. I have many memories of hours spent as a child as my family members who didnt understand how to handle my curly hair brushed it while dry.    Ive never used Keratin treatments and cant say one way or the other there.    TLDR Japanese is not worth the cost or longterm damage.

The tangling and strawlike quality of your ends may be protein too much or too little. See this link  for example. Do some research. The sad truth for us all is that you have to experiment and observe. If you try a product trying only one at a time is hardest part take close note of the ingredient list whether your hair likes it or hates it. Keep notes. I actually keep ingredient lists of products by category in Evernote OCD I know. Its helped me realize for example that my hair loves conditioners with Behentrimonium Methosulfate near the top.

10400698,0,t3_5oxlqo,I go back and forth with it. It takes longer to get ready in the AM and I wake up at  as it is. I dont have a ton of time to squish and plop so I usually rinse normally and use curling cream for a halfway decent day. As soon as I pull my hair back into a tail my top layer curls straighten and frizz so usually day  is just my hair pulled back and no sight of a curl. I tend to go back to it because Ill look in the mirror five days in a row and hate how my curls look. In general I have particularly difficult curls any ways so its exhausting to maintain. Recently I received a bad devacut and am in a rut of wanting to make them look as nice as possible and not caring until it grows out again. ,curlyhair,dcmzhzi,3,t5_2t79l

10956467,0,t3_5wdrcm,Your scalp could also be transitioning. You mentioned that shampoo was your last holdout. Sometimes the scalp gets greasier than normal for a few weeks because it was compensating for the drying shampoo by producing more oil and then eventually it adapts to needing to produce less oil.However for a medical issue like dermatitispsoriasis medicated shampoo almost always triumphs over curly girl.

11126297,0,t1_det2wey,I use Deva No Poo. I rinse it all out then I squish in Paul Mitchel Round Trip Curl Definer which I get at Ulta. In your case squish your conditioner into the ends and flip your head up and arrange with your fingers then let air dry. Try the terrycloth before the squish  it might work.

Then I flip my head squeeze out the excess water and squish to condish. I keep my head flipped and then I plop in a tshirt. I usually leave it in for like a half hour and then I use LA Looks gel. Cheap blue stuff. Sort of squish it in. Dry with a diffuser upside down thank god I work with chiropractors. Hahah and Im good to go.

If nopoo isnt a thing where you live look for some cleansing conditioner suave is really cheap and has worked well for me and try alternating that with your sulfate free shampoo.

Today I used Living Proof Curl conditioning wash and followed it with sectioning my hair and using the detangling rinse. I scrunched and sort of squish to condished.

I then plopped for a few hours with a new tee shirt and after scrunched with Garnier Fructis Curl Scrunch controlling gel. My hair was still very damp during this step.I allowed my hair to air dry then scrunched the stiffness out. Flipped my head over and fluffed my roots with my fingertips.

Make sure that hair is detangled while rinsing out conditioner. Leave hair sopping wet no squeezing out!. With head back sopping wet hair use the devaCurl defining gel and scrunch. Also with head back sopping wet still use the devaCurl Frizzfree Volumizing Foam. With cotton tshirt scrunch out any excess waterusually not much left. Massage roots of hair with finger tips for volume  I forgot to do that in this picture. Flip hair over and diffuse top. Air dry!,curlyhair,dg8gxby,3,t5_2t79l

11755628,0,t1_dgsikxm,Well most people with curly hair do not have the same problem with oil that you seem to have. Most of us dont have very oily hair to begin with and need to add oil. Like I said you might want to try shampooing once every few days or once a week and cowash in between washes. Try it out I dont think your hair will get too dry. ,curlyhair,dgsj3av,3,t5_2t79l

11788039,0,t3_685mgg,Some people are sensitive to shea butter and their hair does unpleasant things when it has too much of it. I use she moistures  in  superfruit shampoo conditioner and mask which all have shea as an ingredient but not a primary one. The raw shea butter line does me no favors.If you try it again with the advice the other poster gave you and still dont like it Id try a different mask. If you like shea moisture and your problem is dryness the manuka honey and mafura oil mask does wonders for most people. I bleach my hair and using that one after a root touch up gets me back in good shape.,curlyhair,dgw7pa9,2,t5_2t79l
