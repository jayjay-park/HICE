2183491,0,t1_clh3nlx,YMMV  I work in an almost entirely tapeless facility. Everything gets ingested straight to Avid or EVS whether its from the studio or an incoming line so people can start editing straight away. Finished programmes get wrapped to DPP standards and sent by file transfer to our playout facility or occasionally played down the line by an EVS operator.The handful of tapes we do get are generally archive material  but a fair bit of stuff turns up on a hard drive.Most of the stuff thats been written about it seems to be about the KVM system which isnt very exciting but you can see a bit about it here,broadcastengineering,clhdi20,1,t5_2stue
