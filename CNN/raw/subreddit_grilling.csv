Wood chips went onto the foil. A pan meant to grill veggies goes upsidedown  over that and then my meet ribs in this case goes over that.  Keep things low enough to get a good air temp in your grill and watch for flame outs. Nothing lives up your experience like a grill full of gas...Full disclosure my wife got me a WSM . for Fathers Day this year.  There really is no substitute for a proper smoker.

If i were to do them again I think id forget completely about putting wood in the smoker and just enjoy the charcoal and the marinade.

In my experience shrimp especially small guys cook amazingly quick on a hot grill  where pork can cook for longer and still come out fine.

And you dont get the same flavors all the complex hydrocarbons from cooking it arent there. There isnt the same gradient through the meat. Its how I imagine lab grown meat would taste. And yes I finish it for  seconds a side on the grill. Its not that its bad its just different and not how I like my steak. There are a lot of meats that I really like for sous vide. Flank steak is amazing. Salmon so smooth and perfect it tastes like salmon flavored butter. Pork chops you can cut with your Fork. But ribeye just isnt the same. It lacks something that only being grilled over a hot flame can do. ,grilling,d0nimm5,1,t5_2rcvg

8464727,0,t1_d5z13ch,Just for clarification meat does not have to be falling off of the bone. Ribs should bend and the bark should look almost as if its bending. However falling off the bone cleanly isnt a huge problem.   If you want that nice smoke ring what you can do is use your smoker box fill an aluminium pan with about an inch or two of water and set your ribs directly over it. This should be on the unlit burner side of your unit. Youll get the tenderness youre looking for and a beautiful ring. Doesnt look too bad though and it seems you learned some things on your own.,grilling,d5zmm0w,2,t5_2rcvg

Basically you get the meat nearly done in a lowtemperature oven or on a cooler area of the grill then finish it off on high heat either on the stove or on a hotter area of the grill.  This is as opposed to the more traditional order of starting with the sear and then finishing it off in the ovencooler area of the grill.Dont worry about what color the meat is  as long as your thermometer is accurate go by the temp and not the appearance.,grilling,d6nnsl1,2,t5_2rcvg
