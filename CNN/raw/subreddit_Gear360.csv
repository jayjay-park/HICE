7573388,0,t3_4ixefb,The FAQ I get from my Korean purchase is the device in Korean? Surprisingly it is all in English in terms of what the device menu shows. The manual is in Korean but you can source the english manual online. Best of all the ActionDirector  degree video editor is fully in English except the Word Titles still need work as it looks wonky and stretched in the videosSo lets sum up the negatives In the device the lens labeled as Front lens is actually the rear lens ActionDirector App does not have proper Word titles effects made for  If you do not have an i and  gigs ram with a Geforce GTX  then the stitching times in your ActionDirector may take sometime to stitch There is HDMI output for the deviceI will add more to the list as I use this device more but you can see most of vids on my youtube vids,Gear360,d3322mk,2,t5_3cpoj

7906570,0,t3_4nhu37,This should point you in the right direction. The way I would do it is to convert the image to a cubemap which unwarps the image. Then do my editing.  Depending on the end use case I would either keep it as is convert to Gear VR compatible cubemap or convert back to an equirectangular image which is what the gear  images are. ,Gear360,d44ruym,2,t5_3cpoj

8721897,0,t1_d6t8hgp,Not true.  If I tag the photo with the projectiontypeequirectangular tag or tsf it as taken by RICOH Facebook WILL recognize and stitch it.  See  for detailsHowever the result is unusable as it is stitched using the Thetas thin profile and didnt account for gears ball shape and bulging lenses.I will test streetview but my test with Google Photo also get similar poorly stitched result that doesnt account for the distance between gears two lenses.In any case I would recommend against getting the gear at this stage until there is more native support for photo.,Gear360,d6vvm7a,1,t5_3cpoj

11228929,0,t1_df4pym9,hey that turned out pretty good. My only suggestion which youre probably aware of is sticking the camera on a tripod to get the camera to human height so when looking at the images the perspective isnt distorted.,Gear360,df4s8ox,2,t5_3cpoj
11462332,0,t3_63lyvg,great vid. I think the cuts on the merchants were great but on the dev demos I think they could have been longer to showcase the games a bit more.,Gear360,dfv8y1a,2,t5_3cpoj
