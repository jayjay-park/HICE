3349274,0,t3_2yebcm,Ummm... You only need to use the see saw twice actually. You put six on each side. One side will be heavier. But you dont know why. Then each islander gets off the see saw two at a time one from each side. Once the see saw balances you know that one of the last two people who got off the see saw is either heavier or lighter. Those two become the possible variables. You then clear the see saw entirely. You have to note which of the two Islanders who came off the see saw and caused it to balance possible variable came for which side.  Then have one of the possible variables sit on one side of the see saw and an islander who you know by process of elimination is not the variable sit on the other side.. If the variable islander is heavier and he originally came from the heavier side  the see saw goes down on his side and you know hes the odd one. If he balances and he came from the heavier side then you that it is  the other variable islander who is light. It works both ways. ,brooklynninenine,cpa1jgc,-1,t5_2x7x1

US shows tend to be what?  minutes without ads? So thats the equivalent of just over four US episodes per Sherlock episode. That then adds up to about  per series. Which seems pretty standard.
