7136766,0,t3_4dbdtu,Personally I would prefer having a place where friendly positive discussion doesnt get downvoted. Youre able to talk about the issues you have with the game and not get told that you suck ask questions and get answers which make sense. But also have threads maybe weekly in which people can just rant about angers them. Summoner School is a great group of guys who help eachother specifically with ingame problems maybe we can be a more general forum. ,LoLCommunity,d1pdey5,10,t5_2x02t
7217489,0,t3_4e68c8,I think the concept is good but the actual masteries are kind of lame.It was supposed to be about adding choice to the mastery system but in the end you just choose whichever keystone works best with your champion just like the old system. The closest thing to choice we had was Fervor vs. Warlords Bloodlust on ADCs and that didnt last long.I just wish the masteries were less tailored to specific roleschamps.,LoLCommunity,d1ykmln,2,t5_2x02t

10383123,0,t1_dckyrlk,To be honest this is why I said hypothetical because I failed to find any other sources. Please provide me with any other sources that might help with reaching a little bit of more accuracy Note Im targeting ranked so the number of unranked players wouldnt make a difference. ,LoLCommunity,dckzoy9,1,t5_2x02t
