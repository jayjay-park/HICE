90201,0,t3_1uremx,As a parent  judge  exdebater the current form of LD has messed up by belief that parents who participate in their kids activities are motivated to learn what they need to know to be useful participants in said activity.  In fact most parents who judge seem only to give a sh!t to the extent that have to which is not very much.  The only reason they show up at all is to fulfill the schools judge quota.  I mean not understanding arcane theory is fine but at least understand ValueCriterion and burden of proof.  This is more true on the local than the national circuit because I dont think there are many parent judges on the NatCir but parent judges are mostly worse than useless.  ,lincolndouglas,ceop5b3,4,t5_2rbui
124252,0,t1_cesiuyd,How? To simplify extraction is removing something resource is something that a country can use to get wealth. For the purpose of this debate which essentially centers around natural resources it is safe to say that resource extraction is the removing of something that a country can use to get wealth from the environment. That can include even the hunting of elephants for their elephant tusks. It can mean deforestation coal mining or oil etc... so by construing it in such a way that it limits resource extraction to JUST three things is very abusive.,lincolndouglas,ceskwvl,2,t5_2rbui

1215329,0,t3_27xbqn,A cool thing that I used to remember the Prima Facie issues in debate are the S.H.I.T.S. they are significance harms inherency topicality and solvency. Pretty much you can address an argument on those  different issues which helps in diversifying your arguments. If an argument doesnt beat back all five of those issues its pretty much a nonissue in the round. For example if an advantagecontention isnt topical the affirmative cant claim it. Likewise if there is an inherent barrier stopping the advantage from occurring then the aff cant get the benefits from the advantage. ,lincolndouglas,ci6ccyn,2,t5_2rbui

2959859,0,t1_co3hbux,Source? This just seems unlikely. I have quite a few friends who went to VBI LA. They certainly are not K debaters and they said that although there were more K debaters and more instructors who know K litstrat than at other camps K debaters were not most of the camp. They also never reported feeling pressure to run or to avoid certain arguments. Maybe other people have felt pressure but that could just be staff encouraging them to run arguments outside their comfort zones which is a good thing. NSD hasnt even announced a location or staff yet. It looks basically like a firstyear camp this year. ,lincolndouglas,co4jtam,1,t5_2rbui

6582801,0,t3_45ntbx,Theres in my experience roughly three categories a circuita judge can fall into regarding this Conversational  good where talking any faster than someone giving a speech on a stage will lose you points bias the judge against you and possibly lose you the round. Normal person speed  good where the judge doesnt vote off speed but most judges cant understand speech any faster than any other lay person could so you cant go all out. Progressive where you can basically just go as fast as you can manage while still forming coherent words. You could either observe a varsity round with one of the better debaters on your circuit ask a teammate or something like that to figure out which of these youre in. The second one is the trickiest because someone speaking with some measure of speed will have an advantage but going too fast could lose the round.,lincolndouglas,d007rso,2,t5_2rbui

Either they fuck up the framework debate and you win there or they respond to the framework then you trigger skep and the majority of their speech goes to shit cus all offense is now moot. They probably didnt make any presumptionpermissibility claims so that leaves the person who uses the trigger to claim why skep goes affneg uncontested. Also people sometimes put it in there cus they know the round will devolve to theory if it is in their case and they want to have that debate.
