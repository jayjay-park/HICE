9536790,0,t3_5bhves,Dont switch do both.  Youre limited by how powerful your computer is but multitasking several sites is the way to go.  InstaGC requires your first  in redemptions to be gift cards after that you can do Paypal.I abhor surveys so pretty much dont do them.  I prefer watching videos... as many as my computer will allow.  Watch IGC and toolbartv SB are autorun.  Run SBs apps on a phone.  The rest require clicking on a computer.  You can run ncrave SB and ncrave IGC at the same time.  Then add hypermx and volume IGC while also doing jun and ngage SB.   If you are going to spend time actively clicking you might as well do as many sitestabs as your computer allows.,InstaGC,d9olwmn,3,t5_2yuhr

11782746,0,t1_dguy49e,yea I was slowly upping my watching all of a sudden yesterday they did a mass  ban chat blew up with videos not working messages and a few people saying theirs was working and the mods admins  where saying they are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it with  the provider but its out of their control. Really rubs me  the wrong way is when they instagc tell people they are just out of videos for the user when most likely they are IP banned by the provider.... Also that we have no way to contact the provider ourselves to plea our cases.. People that had not even been using watch the last couple days was greeted by  yesterday. ,InstaGC,dgvm22d,1,t5_2yuhr
