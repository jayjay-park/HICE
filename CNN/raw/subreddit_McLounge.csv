3593231,0,t3_2s7spb,Pffft no. The biggest thing I can think of for advice for an interview is if they ask why you want to work at McDonalds do NOT say because of money or because you need a job. As for an open interview I am not sure. Just try to stand out in a good way. Good answers dress relativwly nicely be polite be honest and have good eye contact.,McLounge,cq1uszl,1,t5_2unmb

6494899,0,t1_czr3y10,THIS. My BEST friends have been from mcd. Some of my most fondest memories were at mcdonalds. From  am rides with everyone as we all carpooled to open the store to eating at a  hour diner after work. We would go glow bowling hiking and just EVERYTHING I could imagine. My mcd crew have all found different jobs and yet we all stay together.I was nominated and won crew memeber of the year in  for the entire boston region and that alone is the most proud moment of my entire life. I am now turning  and will have been at mcd for  years and honestly I dont think I could leave anytime soon. Ill probably have this big career in the FBI and still work there on the weekends. As much stress and as much of the bad days Ive had... I LOVED working there. I did. I still love it. some days im so frustrated I want to cry and never come back. Heck my boyfriend thinks im insane because when I come home from MCD I will shower and wash myself at least  times and still swear I can smell the grease but I LOVE it here. Its experiences I will take with me for the rest of my life. ,McLounge,czr4cot,1,t5_2unmb

10074146,0,t3_5jwma5,First off delegating jobs is an excellent start. If your in charge of the kitchen you need to have an eye or the big picture not doing all the little jobs.Secondly communication is key. make sure your crew are talking to each other and that you are talking with the shift supervisor to find any problems before they happen.Third Learn ALL the rules of three to spot danger zones before they become a problem and slow kitchen to a halt. Lastly grab the area management tool for the kitchen then get a manager or someone else who has used it before to run through it with you.,McLounge,dbkolsf,2,t5_2unmb

11090730,0,t1_deoeoa5,My place is actually in the office building so we have McCafe and we dont have Drivethru. We only have about fifty seats and you could imagine the chaos on weekdays noon. But for me Im a very clumsy person. I would have better slip and slide embarrassingly on the floor than putting wrong stuff in the sandwiches and get complained.Im only trained how to slit Chicken fry em and put them in the temperate chamber Not sure what they called. Not even trained how to fry the chips.,McLounge,dep4i1d,2,t5_2unmb
11541767,0,t1_dg3ysjq, at our store is normal management is shit here and owner doesnt give a fuck as long as he has money in his pocket. Already applied to new stores.EDIT Id also like to add my times are always under  and when I go on break and come back whoever was in there managed to get the time up  in under  minutes. The employees here have no discipline or respect for others they cuss at customers argue with managers call off to do drugs and much much more. ,McLounge,dg49emj,1,t5_2unmb
