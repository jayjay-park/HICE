8102269,0,t3_4q6dhg,Congratulations!  I also attempted to post on rbeyondthebump.  Luckily I didnt specifically ask about Ferber and I was guided this this sub.  It is definitely refreshing to find other who understand desperation.  We are on night  right now and it has been very close to smooth sailing since halfway through night .  Its amazing!  I hope it continues to go well for you. ,sleeptrain,d4qrnv1,3,t5_3f3ch
8201331,0,t3_4rjbty,As others have mentioned  I wouldnt worry about bad habits. Yes  shell get into habits but theyre pretty easy to break when theyre young. Might be a hard few days nights when shes  months old but nothing that cant be undone. My vote is to do whatever needs to be done now so that both of you get maximum sleep. She is still super young after all. ,sleeptrain,d52pxm2,1,t5_3f3ch
8413349,0,t3_4uogb9,So one thing I will mention is to ditch the projector. The main thrust of ALL sleep training methods is that the situation when they wake up in the middle of the night needs to be exactly as it was when they fell asleep. If they fall asleep with a soother projector playing music with cute lights they will need it to be turned back on when they wake up in the middle of the night same concept as needing to pop the pacifier back in. This really goes for all methods because the goal of most methods of sleep training is to remove negative sleep associations things the baby requires to fall asleep that may not be there when they wake up like nursing being held or rocked etc.,sleeptrain,d5t7nke,2,t5_3f3ch
8475148,0,t3_4vqy85,If you click on the green Ferber Success! flair next to some posts itll bring up this page that will show you allllll of the anecdotes you need. Also check out our intro post stickied to the top of the sub  my story is in there. TLDR  there is a light at the end of the tunnel! I promise! And there are a ton of fun resources in the sidebar including the How to Sleep Train Using CIO or Dr. Ferbers ProgressiveWaiting Method from NoobMommy that will go through it in detail... but I always recommend buying the book. Ferbers method isnt just about sleeptraining  the book goes through a lot of information about baby sleep and development that is really helpful.Good luck!,sleeptrain,d60xo72,4,t5_3f3ch
8623798,0,t3_4xxe72,Have you tried cutting feeds short at night too? Still cosleeping or in a crib?Its tough because hes probably in the thick of separation anxiety so hes gonna be upset when you leave.,sleeptrain,d6jkrnt,1,t5_3f3ch
8892528,0,t1_d7fmko1,Maybe you can try to read the book by Richard Ferber because it explains a lot about infant and children sleep. It can give an insight in how children sleep and also learns about transitioning to their own cribroom. I know it must feel like a long run but maybe it helps to understand the underlying theorie. Most ways of sleepcoaching are about changing the sleep associations indeed and while I guess you read and tried it all it can still be good to read about it from someone whos been researching sleep problems for years now. Its not strange your boy wants to do it as he has learned. It can help to play in his bedroom during the day make that a happy place. When he likes that place you can put him there for naps and after that for the nights. You can even sleep with him there so that its not  steps in one. I would not go full CIO when he vomits all over the place. It makes a strong negative association with sleeping alone. Because theres no consistency it might be he gets upset for not knowing for sure whats gonna happen next. Have you introduced a lovey? It can help using that in your play during the day and giving it him by night giving it as much cuddles as he gets so hell be comfortable with it.That being said it is best to try for at least  weeks. You dont have to change all the sleep associations at once but just gently towards his room together then his lovey then other stuff. It looks like you already have a steady bedtime routine so thats good.It can also be good to push for an earlier bedtime so he wont be overtired. If possible anything between .pm and pm can be good but try to avoid later. But the problem is especially with sleep problems theres much more to it than just plain bedtime routines. It can be stuff during the day or night that makes it hard and theres no way to cover it by a Reddit post. I really recommend reading Ferbers book for more background about sleep and sleep problems. And last but not least if you are happy with the arrangements as they are you can also just let it be. Theres no rule that you LO needs to be in his own room or in his own bed. Theres no rule that you have to stop feeding him at night. But I get it if youre not happy at all with how its going right now ! If you dont have the money to buy the book of Ferber you can subscribe at Scribd.com and read the first month for free. The book is available there so you can read it onlineon your phone. You can always PM me if youd like to talk about things being hard have questions or anything else. ,sleeptrain,d7gr7l0,1,t5_3f3ch
8930148,0,t1_d7l2y68,I was wondering shes been really clingy today. In a nice way sure but I work from home and its kind of inconvenient when she HAS to be on my lap  minutes per hour. Shell be mo tomorrow so it could be just the normal phase but do you think it could be because of last night?,sleeptrain,d7l9szs,1,t5_3f3ch
8962592,0,t3_530rcw,Hopefully smooth sailing! Naps can take a little longer to work out length usually. Teething always screws us up. Usually he can just be nursed for comfort and put back down oncetwice a night but occasionally even with Advil hell be awake and angry at am and nothing works we had  days in a row of this a few weeks ago while he cut  new teeth. ,sleeptrain,d7p62xo,2,t5_3f3ch

10501031,0,t3_5qcb1g,My daughter is breastfed but we did one at a time cold turkey and it worked well. We did cry it out but she didnt wail or anything  mostly just fussed and it only took a night or  to stick luckily.  We cut the earlier feed first and then the am feed which was the harder of the .What really helped for us was bringing her swimming the day we started because she was always so tired that she slept through the night after swimming.  Maybe theres an activity that would work the same for you?  So Sunday  we swam and she slept through on her own Monday we cut a feed do that for the week. Next Sunday  swim cut the other feed Monday..,sleeptrain,dcyeigu,1,t5_3f3ch
