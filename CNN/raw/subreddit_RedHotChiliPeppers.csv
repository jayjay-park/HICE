3809991,0,t1_cqq9k4k,One of my favorite memories happened last spring break. We were driving around Malibu with his son and my best friend and band mate. I was playing him a CD with a few of our songs on it and the last song came on Aliens so we took a longer route along the beach. It was playing and was already a very peaceful moment when all of a sudden my uncle slammed on the breaks and ran out of the car with his son right behind him toward the ocean. I was flustered but me and my friend followed. When we got to the beach two baby humpback whales were within  feet of the shore playing together. We stood at the shore and witnessed an awesome thing of nature. It felt like a sign of some sort since it happened during our song and gave me this weird sense of motivation. ,RedHotChiliPeppers,cqqki9n,10,t5_2s504

7755895,0,t3_4li790,Great topic OP! I love AK to pieces so I was shocked to learn there are fans of the band who dont enjoy him. That voice has been part of my personal soundtrack for the majority of my life I cant imagine a world without it and dont want to.Im going to try to narrow this down to five because his voice is one of my favorite instruments I appreciate that you mentioned Savior because its my favorite song ever hands down. But since IWY Ive connected Savior to Ethiopia another one in my top five I immediately thought of Savior when I heard Ethiopia for the first time and I like that combined they involve three generations of Kiedis men. I might be projecting. But I think of those two songs as a unit and I feel very moved by that. Show Me Your Soul! This track doesnt get nearly as much love as it should. Senntimentalll gennntlemennn is honestly one of my favorite moments. Its goofy but I like when theyre goofy. Skinny Sweaty Man is a masterpiece I feel very strongly about this. Im at my fourth choice and starting to freak out about all of the vocallyrical moments I cant fit into this meager list. Obviously this is not complete. But for my fourth choice Id like to suggest Backwoods. I love this song top five and I love the theme and I love his little solo where he shouts out some of the pioneers of rock. Backwoods like the rest of my top five makes me feel like I found a part of myself that was missing. Warped I think might be my favorite set of lyrics for now. I love how he sings on it too but what I like most about that aspect is that its so affected that you dont initially pay attention to the lyrics once you get a chance to its like getting punched in the face. People give him a hard time about his lyrics but no matter how absurd he gets there are more than enough moments of sheer brilliance to convince me hes actually kind of good at this whole writing thing.Whew!

Now why couldnt they have just found those two together?

10294139,0,t1_dc9nzkn,Honestly I always struggle with the last  FS IWY and TG. Im With You and The Getaway actually rank pretty much the same for me and I think theyre simply too mellow. FS is too much pure funk and too little rock for me. Obviously I still love them all but those  kinda stick out for me as the worst ones.,RedHotChiliPeppers,dcawad7,1,t5_2s504
10305917,0,t1_dcc7j4v,Im talking about it purely from a production stand point I cant believe he went along with it. Just the EQ and mix of it all was so bad. It was so thin and plastic sounding. I didnt mean his parts were bad they are always great but the end product didnt do him justice. His talent and beats deserve more from a tonal standpoint I love his shit so I think danger mouse did him wrong by recording them so awkwardly.  I think you may have misconstrued my statement. He deserves better than what the record produced in terms of sound not talent. Thank you for the input  ,RedHotChiliPeppers,dcc8bqa,2,t5_2s504

11706767,0,t3_66y7m1,If you were around the sub a few headers ago you might remember this I reckon that would be an amazing print.   If youre supposed to come up with an entire concept on your own well I always loved the image in This Velvet Glove of just another star falling in your yard like its some everyday event. I imagine it like theres a guy sitting on his back steps drinking a beer and wearing sunglasses and just in front of him is an epic bright fireball meteor thats just fallen from out of space. Maybe hes shading his eyes with his hand. ,RedHotChiliPeppers,dgmzohi,6,t5_2s504

11746893,0,t1_dgrersj,Ticonderoga hasnt been a well received track on TG probably bc its got a heavy hitting quirky and different sound than what people want to hear from the band. I dont know but I think Josh had some influence towards this one. I personally love it its honestly my favorite track on the album. Guess its not gonna get the appreciation it deserves.,RedHotChiliPeppers,dgrjg5n,2,t5_2s504
