6537902,0,t1_czutk6b,gt extortion powersAt what point and reallife examples would be helpful here does unions collective bargaining become extortion?gt they can quit and start their own business This is always the solution I hear proposed but it isnt a solution because if everyone did that there would be no labor force to support those businesses. Therefore everybody can just start their own business doesnt solve the problem because no everybody cant start their own business. You cant have a sustainable economic structure where everyone owns there own business but has no employees to produce anything. You need a realistic proposal that involves a realistic situation with both capitalists and workers involved not just telling the workers to become capitalists. Thats like telling someone if they dont like slavery they should go become a slaveowner and then the problem is solved.In addition to that not everyone has the capital necessary to start a business often because their wages are too low which brings us back to unions.

One of the weaknesses of democracy is that it produces leadership who act more emotionally rather than from a strictly logical point of view. Temporarily providing shelter for refugees gives you nothing but good will. Its a drawback we must accept in order to have representative government. The real crisis here is the failure of the EU. They found a pseudostate with the exact balance of decentralized and centralized power to make smaller members feel like they get no say and larger members feel like they have to carry everyone else. Its basically the Articles of Confederation come again. Plus most of the EU is a mixture of Social Democrat and Social Conservative countries.

It does appear that capitalism very slowly raised the living standards of workers at a much much slower rate than it does of capitalists but capitalists seem extremely determined to fight against workers rights and to undercut workers who are doing well by exploiting third world labor that doesnt enjoy the same protections as first world workers.Basically I see absolutely no evidence that capitalists want workers to succeed.  Their actions towards workers throughout the last three centuries seem to indicate that capitalists want to exploit workers the best they can and are happy to let workers die if it turns a profit.Since capital seems to want the worst possible outcome for workers I dont think its reasonable to claim that workers and capitals interests align.,CapitalismVSocialism,d02wm3f,1,t5_3cct3

Its mostly a bunch of overeducated mathematicians calling themselves economists and fiddling with equations and numbers all day to no real benefit.Economics is supposed to be a way of thinking. It starts with praxeology that human action is purposeful. That voluntary exchange benefits both sides. Everything else should follow from that principle or its not really economics anymore. Macro is a psuedoscience. As you said no one knows. So they need to stop trying. Just let people be free to exchange and things will work out for the best. As Henry Hazlitt said there is the seen and the unseen. Economists today spent way too much obsessing over what can be seen numbers charts graphs data. But the unseen is actually  of whats important in economics. What you cant see when you conduct fiscal stimulus is all the economic activity that got crowded out. But it would have existed nonetheless. What you dont see with minimum wage is all the jobs that are not created. But they would have existed nonetheless.Once you understand this basic premise  of mainstream economics becomes bullshit.Just stick to the basic principles and youll do fine. Take ECON  Principles of Microeconomics when you get to college and go no further.

It is more profitable to create another flavor of bubblegum than to give millions of people the medicine they need. This can and should be considered amoral.. The market is not logical. Just because something sells on the market doesnt mean people truly want it or need it as explained with the bubblegum example. Free market advocates claim that through supply and demand everyones needs are served but fact is a persons needs is only accomodated insofar he can pay for them. And so we have people producing expensive luxury products for the rich while people are starving or are in need of medicine. We like luxuries and we like people to have food. We want to reorganize the economy in order to produce to accomodate needs not to accomodate the market which distributes goods by an anonymous abstract scheme and by its own rules. . A lot of this serve your fellow man is only done for capital accumulation itself. I.e. you pay someone for making a marketing scheme for your product in order to accumulate capital. Your fellow mans needs are still not served with your work it is capital accumulation that is served. Which in turn can then be used to serve your needs  but not to an extent we want it to.. Capitalism distorts commodities due to capital accumulation. Planned obsolence for example. The culture industry. . It is not moral to assume that just because one person has nothing to offer to the market he deserves to die of illness in return even though we have the means to produce enough medicine for all people in the world. That is ideology.. Moral is to overthrow all circumstances in which man is a degraded hopeless oppressed and pitiful being. Not beng able to get basic goods because your work is unable to sell on the market at a high enough price due to pure chance i.e. the place you were born at definitely falls under this.BTW The free market is actually hugely progressive from previous modes of production and has a couple of great advantages.

It gives humans freedom to pursue their interests by reducing the socially necessary amount of labor labor theory of value where the value of a commodity is based on how long it takes make it and isnt subjective but objective. So everybody benefits instead of the few. In addition it allows voluntary trade of personal commodities while preventing socially important production from being controlled by the few.It is also the only system that takes human nature into consideration since many contemporary sociologists agree that humans are inherently cooperative not competitive. In addition competition is inherently more wasteful than cooperation  the resources that are currently used to suppress or outcompete competition could be turned to the public good. Instead of rewarding corporations that destroy the environment and the working class with profitseeking behavior.This system has never been applied in reality because members of the other system were so afraid of it that they sabatoged it with trade embargoes revolutionary support and propaganda..In the other system humans are not rewarded according to their merits because many of them are wealthy landowners from birth. Risk is collectivized through public trading of shares and bank loans that are bailed out by the state. While some individuals can increase their social status this system would fall apart without an underpaid working class to labor for the gain of the few. Human nature is assumed to be competitive in the face of scientific research and the entire system is founded on members exchanging in a market acting in their own rational selfinterest when there are many many reasons they would not and do not do so.This system will soon come crashing down around the ears of its proponents because it pits the working class against progress on purpose while leaving billions of people in poverty around the world.My post is not a serious argument.

It is an attack on command economies.Sort of. The ECP argument also posits that most forms of socialism e.g. the varieties that are hostile to markets  from state socialism to communism and so on  which most of the selfproclaimed socialists in this sub advocate inevitably leads to the need for some kind of centralized bureaucratic distribution method once the economy starts to scale beyond a couple hundred people. Once that happens the ECP rears its head and shortages waste and inefficiency are virtually guaranteed to start happening.Market socialism is an attempt to address this and Im actually quite sympathetic to it. All it does is state a preference for most or all companies to be owned directly by workers but still operate in a market context which is completely possible to do even today. Its compatible with mutualism Individual Anarchism of the American variety think Tucker and Spooner and anarchocapitalism.

But alas tis so....gt Nuisance laws comply with this logic and help solve difficult tort issues dealing with air and water.I agree.. but they cut both ways.  For example...gtand then you would be violating the property rights of everyone else with your atmosphere going into their property.Heavens no! Like a gas my atmosphere stops daintily at the boundary of their property!...but like a nuisance animal trampling crops their soil sometimes actively absorbs my property trapping it with its wiles!  I DEMAND restitution!Also I own everything from the mantle down.  Please remove your property within  hours returning any atmosphere it feloniously pilfered.gt To get some kind of restitution from me you would have to prove that I have materially damaged your atmosphereWhy I have a small houseplant and am actively trying to change the oxygenCO balance of my property.gtExamples would be oxygen tanks enclosed spaces with special makeups.You may be on to something here...The metal is not property.  Anyone could pick up a clod of dirt intermingled with MY purloined atmosphere! and have iron in their hand.The atmosphere isnt property of notme.  I have a few questions for whomever has been putting it there......but pressure and bottle... might be property.  Here is something which is no matter which was not the automatic birthright of discovery of a mythical first human suddenly sprung naked posessionless and miraculously knowing all human knowledge  the birthright of us all.  An act is property but a thing is not it is mere tragedy that matter is apparently the general substrate of an act the latter of which is the perogative and belonging of an actor.for a historical note at this point you can accuse people of blasphemy if they overstep a notion of property... from a eurotheologistic standpoint endowed with certain inailenable rights by their Creator ties very firmly with what is this thing property made of and who is the actor who created this?.Minus the historical notes this notion is semicommon among enlightenment philosophers.  The notion of earth as property is contrary to virtually any analysis including natural birthrightinalienable rights the notion of labor the principle that it is an improvement over the state of nature or a deed illegitimate to claim to be worth doing... while the notion of growing crops there can involve a human action.It also matches nearperfectly the freedom to travel laws which cover the vast majority of the greater european area.Its only one possibility... but acts not matter are property does have a bit of foundation if it is a possibility one would like to consider...Dont worry.  I only own the carbon dioxide in the air.  Unless were taking extra steps in the chain in property in which I also own the nitrogen and oxygen because I own a small houseplant.

6649683,0,t1_d06wj5v,I think that a big part of the problem is that people confused the governance issues with the economic issues. So I would go with something likeSocialism is an economic system characterized by cooperation voluntary or coerced rather than competition by sharing rather than private ownership. Socialism can exist on various level ranging from small household to large national and inbetween. Governance is a distinct question from economics. Politically socialism has been proposed and promoted from locally as communes to worker coops on a town or regional scale to national movements ranging from social democracies to full on international communism.This makes it clear that there are many things that are socialist and that socialism is not a political system. We can then move on to the discussion of what sort of systems might be good or bad without confusing a worker coop with the Nazis or Stalinism.,CapitalismVSocialism,d074v3n,1,t5_3cct3

In that case its a question of how we struggle and what our tactics are and I am firmly in favor of repossessing and repurposing this hypothetical factory. Since were talking about a small business rather than some venture capitalist firm lets assume that the owner is not absentee and actively works in that factory and is an integral part of its operations. We should force a change  in relationship between this capitalist and his or her workers so that they stand on common ground going into the future. If thats not possible then perhaps the factory can die a relic of a a foregone economic system and that would be fine too.

6735544,0,t3_47wysj,gtIf a portion of workers in an enterprise protest via refusal to work the capitalist possesses enough resources to get themselves by or they hire desperate individuals from the laborreserve thus making any refusal to work by the laborers for the sake of better conditions wages etc. dangerous and more difficult. One weird thing I notice is that marx is obsessed with factory labor. There is no way that any of his theories are even close to reality in anything other than factory life in the industrial revolution. A strike is very damaging to businesses and is very capable of destroying the business. There is nothing wrong with striking in my opinion however I prefer to just get a different job if Im unsatisfied in my current work. gtThis demand for labor is decided by the capitalistclass and with this control they decide who is given access to subsistence and who dies out.The labor is not determined by the capitalist class as capitalists as he uses the word are separate people doing their own thing for their own purposes. For instance if one organization decides to cut back on employment to a minimum and only pay as little as they can get away with another may decide to pay their employees a premium. Theyll be able to steal the best workers from the first organization and outcompete them in the market. gtThe laborer not only labors for their wage i.e. their means to subsistence but also labors in trying to even find an opportunity to gain access to the possibility of acquiring this wage.Getting a job is tough in certain job markets but this assumes that human capital in the labor force is less than the demand for human capital in the labor force. This isnt always the case in many industries there is a sore lack of labor and therefore the laborer gets a better deal. It behooves the worker to keep an eye on market conditions and try to learn a bit about different industries so they can exploit this.gtIn the workforces that employ a strict division of labor due to the need to produce capital the laborer loses more and more control of their labor  themselves  and are brought down to the level of a machine undertaking specific predetermined tasks.I find this to be the opposite of the case job tasks have a tendency to grow and laborers tend to say Thats not my job I want to do just what was in the job description.gtWith this the worker now regards machinery as competition and is quickly replaced by said machinery.Machinery does often replace people in their jobs but not for the reasons hes stated. gtIf the capitalist by some virtue is allowed to and does establish the marketprice of a commodity above its value only the capitalist benefits and not the worker who produced the commodity.I dont understand this sentiment market price is a measure of market value and value is subjective. gtf the material wealth of society declines the worker loses that which is their subsistence the capitalist loses luxury.The material wealth of society does not generally decline. gtIf the demand for labor exceeds supply the wages rise in value but give rise to overwork so as the capitalist does not pay a heavy amount for slow work in which the laborers shorten their lives. Id need an example of this actually happening in order to believe it. So Marx was alive during a different time and in that time he saw the industrial revolution. I think its safe to say the industrial revolution is in fact over for western nations and that were now in the information age if you want to call it that. We do not generally work for a wage based on our production but based o what were doing for the business in general. Factory labor is not as common as it once was and the most common job in the US is Truck driver. Truck drivers dont actually produce anything they allow material liquidity and allow for commerce across state lines and even national borders. Truck driving is also a very competitive industry relative to other industries and if you dont believe me check out the paper and see how many ads you see offering to train people in truck driving and how many people are hiring CDL.Marx wasnt an idiot but he was definitely wrong about lots of things and I dont think that applying him to the current times makes sense at all.,CapitalismVSocialism,d0g0i9i,10,t5_3cct3

6786269,0,t3_48o73d,Im actually a minarchist who believes in a particular kind of restricted natural duty theory of social contract Kants justification for the state but I was an ancap for a long time so I think I can give a good crack at an ancap answer.gtThe social contract doesnt exist as a single legal document that one writes up and then signs to be stored away for future reference.As you say the social contract is very clearly not a single historical event which establishes consent. However this is one very common way of arguing for a particular kind of social contract in particular its a common libertarian way of arguing for a social contract so its not as if ancaps are just strawmanning the position.The general problem seems to be establishing what the contract actually is how its establishedIf the social contract is supposed to operate like any other contract so that you consent to the terms of the contract by an actual act of consent then there are some pretty clear problems. For one thing its hard to identify what specific actions constitute consent  and if you didnt perform those actions would that constitute nonconsent? For instance if using government roads means that you consent to the government then does not using those roads mean you dont consent? Second it seems like the only way that a lot of these conditions for consent can get going in the first place is through something you did not consent to  for instance in order for the government to begin to provide services for the first citizens who benefited from those services the government probably coerced those citizens to make that provision possible for example by taxing them or by preventing competing organizations from providing the same services. This is most clearly the case with lawsecuritydefense. For example if the US government commanded the obedience of native Americans because they were residing on US government land this wouldnt be legitimate because the only reason the US government owns that land is by conquering and subjugating the nonconsenting Indians so the conditions for consent depend on a coercive act which invalidates the states claim to those conditions.This general approach to social contract theory which establishes some way of providing actual consent is called a transactional consent theory  the idea is that people have certain moral rights in a vacuum but that that transact or transfer those rights to the state by an act of consent. There are other credible approaches to justification of a social contract but I think its pretty clear that the transactional model which most libertarians criticize is not one of them. It ends up boiling down to you relate to the government by X which means you consent and libertarians saying probably correctly that the only reason X exists is because the government coerced me prior to establishing X!gt It exists as a state of relationships between people communities and societies. We observe its natural convention at work when we interact with our friends as opposed to strangers family members as opposed to foreigners and as one nation in contrast with other nations.This is a more associative theory of political obligation  the idea is that because you exist in some unchosen association with other people this establishes some sort of collective obligation for people due to this association. But it seems like the problem with this theory is that absent some more ethical work to flesh it out its only begging the question we have a political obligation to people based on X association family clan race nation humanity etc. because... why exactly? It seems like the answer is just because of the association we can talk about all the details of that association  the fact that you share certain characteristics or have a shared history or because you tend to cooperate together or something else but again it seems like it builds the conclusion unchosen associations imply obligations into the premise.I dont think its quite as simple as that because I think it is possible to mount a compelling defense of an associative theory of political obligation its actually a theory associated more strongly with conservative political philosophy  although your flair says youre a socialist the best sources for this sort of theory are imo Aristotle and Edmund Burke. But its not very compelling for most people today because people today generally think that consent is a morally important factor for the sort of stuff that the state does and the social contract is supposed to show us that consent actually exists. This associative theory might establish that we have a duty to obey the law and the state has a right to command us but it doesnt establish that this relationship is consensual for the theorists I have in mind who advocate this theory however consent simply isnt important for establishing political authority or obligation.gtIn any country you live in certain rights are accorded to you as a citizen that arent available to other people who arent.First ancaps will disagree with this characterization of rights. Ancaps think and I do too even though Im not an ancap that rights are logically and historically prior to the state even if there exists no state you have certain rights and these rights dont depend on their being secured to be morally important for instance even if you have no way of defending yourself and you live in a stateless island it would still be a violation of your rights for someone else to kill you.Second its unclear what the sort of positive rights youre talking about have to do with the social contract without at least some further explanation. The mere fact that you are given special privileges doesnt seem to imply that your relationship with the person who grants those privileges is consensual  for instance you might be accorded rights to water use against your neighbors so that your neighbors cant use some water but you can because of a local warlord who prefers you to your neighbors. But this doesnt mean that everything else the warlord does to you is consensual all it means is that hes nicer to you than everyone else.gtWhen someone talks about the social contract this is simply what theyre referring to  Yes yes we all know who John Rawls is. However the defense of social contract theory which youve provided is actually not much like John Rawlss theory of justice at all. If youre going to condescendingly posture yourself as better educated than we stupid libertarians at least be better educated.gtClaiming that youre not part of a larger social system because nobody presented you with a piece of paper is just a straw man argument you understand it in your public and private behavior every day.See all above.,CapitalismVSocialism,d0liedd,3,t5_3cct3

Gifts arent meant to compensate. If this were the case theyd be indebted. Gifts are meant to give without reciprocation of equivalency. Think of it as a oneway street.

In the scenario there would be NO damn choice. The employer is offering to save their lives. In real life few employers are not going to let people starve if they can help and it rarely happens. Individuals ARE entitled to the full fruits of their labor. The capitalist generally increases the value of that labor in return for a share. If they didnt then you can just go around them.  In socialism however the labor is so basic that that all the extra value that could be added to my labor by interacting with the capitalist does not happen.

6859526,0,t1_d0tsseu,I cant give you realworld examples of Socialism because every attempt at instituting it has ultimately failed though I guess Cuba is probably the closest. Socialism is a broad term but it is generally an economic system in which the workers collectively own and manage the means of production. There is a planned economy instead of a market in which some stateapparatus or other decides how much of X is to be produced for the people. This is my basic answer but there are entire subreddits dedicated to explaining Socialism and obviously other sources too so I think rather than listening to me you would be better off browsing rsocialism. In Sweden there is still a market economy with private ownership of means of production. There are still employers distributing wages landlords etc. gtHow would it be a system just like Swedens?gtWouldnt there have to be far changes to how the country is ranI cant come up with a specific point plan to shift Americas economy. There are certainly some systematic differences  I believe Sweden has  major political parties they have much higher voter turnout a much higher percentage of their working population are unionized and they probably have a different constitution and parliamentary system.The general answer is that America would need to lessen the political power of the corporations and strengthen the political power of the people. If America could break its  party monopoly and ended citizens united move to publicly funded elections galvanize its working people to unionize and become more involved in the political process and did various things of that nature you would see more policies come into place that would benefit working people  such as free healthcare and education.,CapitalismVSocialism,d0tu4bv,3,t5_3cct3

Additionally the communes should respect basic human rights and allow people to move in and out of them at will.If a commune wants the communal government to allocate economic resources then that is how it will be done if they want some kind of market mechanism that is how it will be done.

6939084,0,t1_d12u61c, The social product is the total output of society measured in material goods. Contribution can be measured by productivity labor or value. This point is very controversial among communists. Ive only just been made aware of the debate myself. For simplicitys sake and to answer your question lets say its measured by productivity. Most people would say thats a Stalinist deviation though. The piecerate wage system in the USSR may have been necessary at the time but in times of peace its highly undesirable. Measuring by value is difficult because without market exchange there really cant be any talk of socially necessary labor time. Brendan McCooney kind of goes into that here  Sure you have the right to find a better paying job. But its an empty threat if you dont have the means to do so. The point is that the wage youre given only covers what you need to reproduce yourself for the next working dayweekmonth. Its not tied to the actual labor performed. Peer pressure is a thing.

In fact throughout Marxs critiques of both bourgeois economists and other socialists he points out that humanity must continually appropriate from nature.In The  Manuscripts Marx argues that what separates humanity from animals is that we engage in conscious purposeful labor.  We labor to survive of course but we are capable of laboring well beyond that survival.  Elsewhere Marx argues against various ahistorical views of society by pointing to the fact that for a great deal of human history class society and coerced labor was indeed necessary to appropriate nature more and more efficiently.It is not quite enough to point to the violence and coercion inherent in capitalism even though it is there and widespread  primitive accumulation and proletarianization exploitation of surplus value so on.  Part of the point of socialism at least in a Marxist sense is that capitalist society that specific phase of class society based around the commodity form contains the possibility of universal human emancipation.  Its precisely because of past coercion and the products the infrastructure the social relations and so on created that the possibility of present liberation arises.,CapitalismVSocialism,d1fj42n,10,t5_3cct3

7141622,0,t3_4d3s2l,Well there are plenty of different forms of democracy. Generally youll see a lot of states that operate under representational democracy where the populace chooses representatives to act as government. States that operate under this representationalism or republicanism are known as republics.The alternative democracy to this would be direct democracy where political decisions are chosen by the populace as a whole instead of representatives. Youll generally find these democracies in communes and small tribes as historically direct democracies have been smothered in the crib sotospeak by larger states.Furthermore both of these democracies can operate under two forms Majority Rules or WinnerTakesAll  The vote is decided by a majority. Consensus or Preferential Voting  A hybrid system where votes are tallied by preferenceOut of all the information proposed above I find both direct democracy and consensus voting to be the best forms of democratic action. Not only does the populace truly command their government as they are their government but they can best decide what everybody wants at least more so than winnertakesall voting. This is further improved with a socialist economy where the means of production are owned in common with direct democracy the people have better say in where resources should be allocated and utilized.So why direct democracy over say monarchy or aristocracy? Because human societies are inherently cooperative. Civilization is the act of humans functioning as a hybrid organism in a way to have only one portion of that organism controlling the rest is not only dangerous but particularly immoral at that.,CapitalismVSocialism,d1pxcpw,1,t5_3cct3

It merely becomes market place force rather than monopolistic force. Having rules come from a market puts a higher degree of accountability on them and gives the society the mechanism to change rules as they see fit.If I want to force someone else to behave a certain way Im going to have to have a much more direct and sacrificial relationship with the application of said force. Im either going to have to risk my health or pay someone else to do so hence the accountability. What sorts of things would I be willing to sacrifice to enforce?

If an secularist doesnt want to live around insufferable Christians who dont want to allow prostitution or whatever then theyd be free to move to a different society that does.I think the conflict in ideas between anarchists is a failure to realize that people want to not only choose what to do on their property but have some say in whats going on in arms length from their property.

They refuse to.Where are the nonmarxist socialists today denouncing people like ChavezMaduro in Venezuela? They dont exist. You guys do not speak out against Marxist attempts at socialism.Thus we have to question how seriously you take this idea that Marxism isnt socialism.gt Because again to criticise socialism you need to criticise how worker control is a negative thing.

Socialist theory  of how to get to socialism is obviously wanting and defective whether it be Marxist or not.gt gt gt gt However I can criticise a society which had private control of the means of production as a way to criticise capitalism regardless of whether or not the aim has been achieved. You can only criticize those aspects of it which reflect private ownership. If you criticize it over public ownership then you are criticizing the state which is antithetical to capitalism you are not criticizing capitalism. This is the typical failure of critique socialists commit to condemn capitalism as if the state could in any way represent capitalism.The simple fact is that you dont need to criticize the failure of attempts to create a society of private ownership we already exist in such societies.

If you fail to meet that threshold there have to be consequences generally the boss is the one who faces repercussions if the group fails. They then make sure the group doesnt fail by making sure the people below them do their job. If no one has any ability to create negative outcomes for the lazy and incompetent why would anyone work? Youre absolutely right that a good boss balances the needs of his workers against the needs of his success threshold.

But I feel like the behavior you want your state to have towards others as well as you own towards that of your hypothetical daughter is one that misses the point of socialism on a fundamental level and a ideological one. Not to mention the idea you wish your state to maintain your existence. Thus I cant call you comrade.The goal of socialism is to achieve democratic control of the economic forces by the worker. Having your state be a controlled environment that denies its resources such as land or living space to the whole of the proletariat misses the main point of socialism being the social liberation of the individual worldwide at least until we have FULLSPACECOMMUNISM.The second point is one for your own hypothetical daughters respect. She should be free to be with whoever she wishes without abandonment from you. If you want to maintain racial purity congrats. Youve had children with a the beautiful woman whom youve made your wife. However your daughter is not you. She is a person individual of you and thusly I believe her life shouldnt be dependent upon that which you approve. It is your responsibility as a parent to raise and care for her so that she may go forth and become what she wills herself to be. Not what you wish her to be.I unlike many other socialists do not mind bigotry. I only care if it takes itself to restrictions or violence forced upon the individual due to the identity they had no control over creating.

Socialists believe that within this system businesses will be consistently created expanded and  of course  profitable for the community. So the question shouldnt be how does it expand without profit but instead it should be Why would businesses stay profitable when there is little incentive to do so?. Or Why would individuals spend their time creating or expanding businesses?.Of course most businesses that are created today are not profitable and fail very easily. If everyone has unlimited access they can continue to draw on the pool until it is empty despite their failure and so even if businesses were formed in this society that were profitable for the community the net gains would still be a loss and eventually either access to the pool would have to become restricted to certain individuals or individuals who drained but did not contribute would have to be punished in some way. ,CapitalismVSocialism,d2cadmv,3,t5_3cct3

This means paying close attention to any variables that might swing the data one way or another. One the key variables that was added was the tendency of satellite orbit to decay in time. As with other models under revision UAH data has now been falling in closer and closer to the data provided by parallel and rival institutions. This is NOT to say that they are identical.

7417471,0,t1_d2kze9f,Alright finally home so I can use quotes. This will also probably be a bit longer and more detailed. gtWhat if I want a summer house? I cant have that either? It doesnt really matter what the specific situation is my point is that there are so many specific situations where your system wont be able to fairly decide who gets whatSure I guess. At this point its Occams razor. Are there no homeless? Are there extra houses? Has the local community worked out a system for those extra houses where they rent houses to people who want to have them for a while? I dont see any more complex situations here than there are now. The points is to eliminate homelessness. Some city can then rent extra houses if it wants. Its not like there has to be some codified rule now. If you rent a house and then somebody needs it and you dont they get it. You might claim it for a summer or something which would be fine as long as somebody else doesnt need it. A community could rent it for moneylabor vouchers they could have a lottery etc. As long as you dont get the house based on inherent inequalities such as inheritance and nobody else needs a house. Your earlier examples also werent really different situations than what I have been saying this whole time. If you had three houses and you needed three houses I said from the start that would be ok. gtI already built my house in my community and now the community is turning against me. Should i just leave?How would they be turning against you? In a revolution yeah probably. People who fight against basic freedoms like having shelter should leave and found their own society. I dont care at that point if you think its fair it is. You can start monetarily with everybody else and work hard to rent a summer home but dont expect to keep any of your shit. Say this situation happens a hundred years after a revolution yeah you should just leave. You have the right to do that. Dont expect any support whatsoever but you and a bunch of buddies can go and make Ancapistan and as long as you dont start killing people and your citizens can leave youll be left alone. gtThat is in no way a fact or even a reasonable assumptionI disagree. If two people work hard they both deserve the same shit. Work regardless of its type is work. Is a CEOs work harder than a plumbers work? I would say no. The only people who can justify being paid more are in my opinion firefighters and maybe paramedics. They work selflessly risking burning alive just to help people. I wouldnt give them more because that sets a bad precedent.gtAgain not a reasonable assumption in any way but even if do you believe that two people who clocked in  hours worked equally hard no matter what? Please consider just how that sounds for a momentSure some people might be lazy. I think its clear that wasnt what I was referring to. This is clear because I For lazy people it would probably be solved by the society maybe you could report lazy workers or be graded by your peers or something I dont know. A million solutions for one problem an efficient one would probably take testing and time.gtHuge assumption again. If I sit around at my job all day literally not doing anything while the other guy is busting his ass making budgets or screwing a house together then people will not just say oh wellAlready answered this. gtYoure equation hours worked with difficulty of the work exhaustion and all other factors that combine to make a job have a certain value todayThis is certainly not true. Have you ever worked as a burger flipper? It fucking sucks. Seriously. Ive worked plenty of jobs chores school whatever and fast food restaurants are the worst. Do you really think CEOs are more valuable and work harder than a firefighter? Or that Tom Cruise deserves more than a paramedic? Obviously they dont. Neither save lives more often the contrary. Our system today equates salaries to supply and demand a dehumanizing system that underpays teachers and overpays celebrities. The difficulty of somebodys work while it may change is close enough to an average that I believe valuing somebodys work as being harder than anothers is valueless and problematic. I am not equating hours but I do believe the amount of hours at a job is the best determiner of somebodys work ethic. I believe all other determiners while important are insubstantial and do more harm than good. gtI contribute in many other ways. Society doesnt owe me any more than I owe themDo you contribute plumbing safety and education? Most likely none or only one. Again if you believe your contribution is equal youre welcome to leave with a bunch of friends and horde all the food to sell them once they get hungry thats your prerogative. gtAnd what would be done to them exactly? Youd take away some of the free stuff you gave them again or what? Put them in prison for being lazy when they dont have a single incentive to work hard?Sure. They could be fired put in jail downgraded in housing whatever the community decides fits. I would rather not force them to starve to death for not wanting to work as hard though. Thats no better than wage slavery or Marxism Leninism.gtObvious answers  no way in hell is anything obvious about thisI dont see how its not I mean not a single question has made me pause for a minute. Youre pretending that this is some computer simulation where we input the rules and watch it happen and every rule has to be predetermined with no margin for error or else the entire system and its ideas are flawed. gtFreedom isnt freedom if youre not free to do anything but what youre violently forced to do by your communityI see giving people food and shelter regardless of how they behave as significantly better than forcing them to starve to death because they dont want to work. If I have the freedom to buy slaves or shoot people is humanity more free or less free? Id say the slaves and the dead would argue that taking the freedom would make them more free to not be enslaves and not be dead. If I give somebody the right to deny somebody food or shelter thats less freedom for everybody what I would call privilege. Crime for anarchists is the act of infringing on somebody elses freedom. Evicting somebody or hording food anything that denies them a rung on Maslows Heirarchy of Needs is a crime. I know what youre thinking oh so is insulting somebody gonna get me shot? No but I regard it as in the same category. Not all crime is equal. also sex would be an exception and an easy case could be made for others but that doesnt change my point or my reasoning Im not really referring to that.Whenif you reply to this please make sure I havent answered it yet.

The reason it isnt bullshit is becasue it is a useful distinction to be able to differentiate different types of property based on the relationship that people have with property.

Even if I move to another country the IRS still legally claims some portion of the product of my labor and could punish me for failing to adhere to their claim.The landlord on the other hand has clearer terms that must be agreed to by both parties. They also control a much smaller portion of territory and could have acquired the property through what I would consider legitimate means labor or exchange. A landlord cannot continue to claim compensation from you as long as the initial terms are met. A landlord could also be filling a legitimate demand on the market and is no different from any other service provider in that regard. In other words their power is far more limited and in theory I cant find an inherent mechanism of wrongness.,CapitalismVSocialism,d332y0t,2,t5_3cct3

7600277,0,t3_4jevxz,I arrived at calling myself an economic noncognitivist because every time I hear people talking about economics all I can think is how they are perpetually and arrogantly declaring metaproperties about incredibly complex systems of human behavior that are riddled with biological facts of human nature that were only barely beginning to appreciate.  Why do people make the decisions in markets that they do?  As often as not we make the decisions we do because we are primates with instincts.  That means we are nothing like fully rational actors.  It means that systems built out of human behavior are shot through with artifacts of our instincts that distort their structure in profound ways and at every scale.How can I respect Marxs or Mises thinking when they didnt understand anything directly about the primate social instincts of our species and how those play out in real life in our behavior?  The answer is that I cant respect their thinking or the arrogant proclamations of anyone else who claims to have economics all figured out when the cold hard fact is that economics is a system made out of monkeys and we dont fully understand those monkeys.  Its like creating an entire theory about how computers work based on ideas of mice and midgets working inside the box when you know nothing AT ALL about the idea of computer programming.  It is absurd to claim certainty or even use words that claim to be firm definitions when were still only generalizing and approximating about complex systems made of components we should have the intellectual honesty to admit we dont understand.Some large part of the narratives that pass for dialog in these forums are actually based on fallacious ideas and premises and definitions.  Ideas that have no real connection to the natural systems they are trying to describe.  Ideas based on ideas that are clearly up for scientific challenge.  EG free will.  I happen to be a proponent but not in any way economists would recognize.  And how about causation itself?  Ever heard of emergence?  I suggest people interested in reality need to study enough philosophy to at least get some perspective on how deeply things are up for debate before declaring that one particular way of shuffling money is best suited to our particular species of primate.,CapitalismVSocialism,d364341,4,t5_3cct3

The presumption here is that people in an ancap society respect ancap institutions just like our current presumption is that people in a democratic society respect democratic institutions.Just like how in our modern democracies we expect elected leaders to step down every  or so years. By definition an ancap society would expect people to have rights insurers and that those rights insurers would act as rights insurers.On the other hand once these institutions are into play there is a networking effect here that benefits firms already in the market as you have hinted at. While I dont think this effect will but it might lead to a monopoly it certainly would disadvantage any firms that try to come late to the party.gtEither way youre not getting proper restitution.Thats a value judgement. We all have different ideas of what proper restitution is. As Coase pointed out in his theorem the important part here is that transaction costs are low. Allowing people to sell their claim to others who are in a better position to pursue the claim is a good way of lowering said transaction costs.gtAt best youd just have like minded companies pooling their resources in corporate insurers that normal insurers still wont be able to compete with. First this is what happens in modern democracies specifically because there are collective action problems with voting corporatism is a feature not a bug. Second there is a free rider problem here where I would make more money by letting all the other companies buy expensive insurance increasing their production costs while I buy cheap insurance and then undercut their prices. Everyone then makes this calculation and no one buys the luxury corporate insurance. Lastly even ignoring this free rider problem the outcome would still be efficient. Companys are just groups of people acting as people do if they pool their resources in a way such that they are willing to spend more money to have a law than others are willing to not have it then the efficient outcome is to have that law and have the people against it pay lower rates.That sounds alien to us because its not wrapped up in a lot of our normative intuitions but in most situations its quite clear that the efficient solution is the one we would prefer. Murder is a good example most people are willing to pay for laws against murder to the detriment of murderers. I dont think things change when people organize into a company.

The militias are part time and have an affinity to the communities they live in so are unlikely to attack their own communities.  This is what the founders of the United States advocated for.

Trade occurred mostly between these groups rather than within them.  It is likely these hoards were communal though possibly controlled by elites. Archeologists found hoards of ingots that were not standardized weight. LenerzdeWilde reference by Shennan did not consider these likely to be used as currency. She did think ingots of standardised weight that were found in hoards and also found broken in small pieces far away from manufacturing sites were likely evidence of currency that was broken into small pieces for smaller transactions. So these anthropologists are not just claiming every ingot hoard is evidence of currency.Money is not defined by whether is impoverishes some people or not.  Generally moneyless societies are poorer that societies with money.  I am not sure with you are claiming impoverishment as a necessity for money.  Money that is not debt based does not need an enforcement mechanism since the possessor of money is the owner.  You seem to be claiming the state is necessary for money therefor if there is no state it cant be money.  Yet if it is used as a medium of exchange even if only between communities and their is no state its seems to show the state is not necessary for money.,CapitalismVSocialism,d3gk8ql,1,t5_3cct3

7778300,0,t1_d3q8jjx,No. Youre making a false equivalence here. There is a fundamental difference namely that on the one hand taxes are enforced at the barrel of a gun and on the other hand nobody is pointing a gun at anyone to get a job whatsoever.The capitalist points a gun at no one for their labor. They give the potential worker an offer and he may accept or reject it. Upon rejection the capitalist does not put a bullet in the workers chest. He does not push or shove the worker into his factory anyway. When the worker does not choose to work there is no coercive means employed by this capitalist to force upon the worker what the capitalist has in mind. The worker can without contradicting the capitalist system even choose to be a capitalist himself since he retains ownership of himself his property and the property he buys he may choose whatsoever he may do with that property which includes entrepreneurship.Taxes on the other hand are forced exchange. Taxes occur when an individual or group of individuals go to another to request money and take it regardless of what the taxed wishes. Those taxing specifically act such that the only possible end is that they have the money. They are therefore morally liable for their action. Labor is voluntary exchange. Labor occurs when an individual or group of individuals go to another to request labor. When the laborer refuses he does not regardless become a laborer. The only possible end is not the labor of the person in question. There are no individuals forcing him to be a laborer the consequences of the refusal to work are not enforced by any individual action. They are enforced by nature. We cannot therefore place any moral weight upon any person or group of people for the consequences of the choice of the laborer. Yet on the other hand it is unquestioningly clear that there must be an individual enforcer of taxation. We therefore may place moral weight upon this individual or group of individuals for this action.So you see there are tremendous differences between the two.,CapitalismVSocialism,d3qbuaf,2,t5_3cct3

I think the furthest the comparison really goes is that ancaps at least on the surface are proposing the privatization of everything which as thats understood in our current system would mean theres no public land or works and no real public input into the operation of what remains it would just be a series of tiny dictatorships that call themselves businesses ruling over what people imagine would be a class of propertyless whatareeffectivelyserfs in the sense that theyre fully disenfranchised and to survive must labor for the people who own all the land.,CapitalismVSocialism,d40osit,3,t5_3cct3

8025486,0,t3_4p37iv,I doubt I could do much  by that time Russia was isolated and the revolutionary moment in Europe had come to a close.  Lenin and Trotsky recognized the probability of ideological decay in the Bolshevik Party due to its efforts to hold power in a society that had not realized the material prerequisites of socialism.Thus I would orient my efforts around three things. Slowing the ideological decay of the Bolshevik Party.  They need to remain aware of the task of world revolution especially given how communists throughout the world were looking to the Bolsheviks for guidance.  The impossibility of socialism in one state must be acknowledged.  Though this decay cannot be prevented  sooner or later the bureaucratic class would dominate  buying time allows more room for step .. Forwarding the world revolution by the means at our disposal.  The October Revolution was being praised but not analyzed.  Yet the lessons of October were the only way forward and revolutionary opportunities were being missed.  The project of building mass parties around the world  and mass parties capable of being active and ideologically coherent parts of the Third International capable of resisting the inevitable decay of Bolshevik rule would be urgent.  Thought taboos need to be destroyed as soon as they appear.. Leave the NEP in place.  Ultimately no matter how one rapidly develops an isolated undeveloped country its not going to be pretty.  But unlike the Five Year Plans the NEP leaves no illusions of socialism.  Thus as decay sets in the International can recognize the Thermidorian bureaucratic regime for what it is and not be misguided.But I say this of course with hindsight.  And there would be serious limits to my range of action  leaders even leaders like Stalin are not isolated strongmen but emerge from their environment.  There was pressure in the Bolshevik Party of the s to orient itself inward and the bureaucratic class was on the rise.  To hold onto power forever would be impossible  the Soviet regime isolated in a capitalist world would first decay then fall to counterrevolution.  What is special about the Soviet Union is not that this in fact happened but that it took until .  Whatever one says about Stalin he was good at preserving the Bolsheviks power.

It sounds like a package deal designed to use access to their economy to leverage certain nations into accepting whatever the other EU members want and if so I suspect this isnt just limited to migration but anything they feel like doing.

8101044,0,t1_d4qlfsb,gt What is the actual difference between a coop under capitalism and a coop under socialism?I think Ive explained this already and since you arent addressing that explanation I dont know where the confusion or disagreement still lies.No the market place is not extraneous to the operation of coops or any other firm under capitalism. Its the context that constrains what is and isnt possible. Whatever the organizational structure they still must maximize profit in order to have access to credit markets and legal protections both necessities under capitalism. The products they make are dictated by the market. The production methods are constrained by the need to keep costs low enough to sustain competitive prices in the market and the need to limit costs and maximize profits together lead to one natural conclusion exploitation.Thats not to say that all workers in a coop are presently being exploited just that the demands of participating in a capitalist system will tend to encourage exploitative practices and this has a corrosive effect even on those firms founded with a commitment to forgo exploitation.Its not unlike the unwinding of much of the New Deal. You can do your best to resist it but the logic of capitalism will eventually dismantle any effort to constrain it to make it respect and tend to the interests of anyone or anything other than capital itself.gt There is no bounty hunter trying to make a wage slave out of you.Am I not surrounded by capitalist firms seeking to destroy my coop from the inside and out? In the consumer market they will drive down prices by employing ruthless employment practices I cannot abide. In the employment market they will draw away my best managers with wages and benefits I cannot provide.The bounty hunter isnt the enemy. He is merely a feature of a system built on exploitation and which feels cheated when opportunities to exploit are permitted to passby. In the context of the analogy he is a metaphor for the constant danger that so long as the institution exists the forces of slavery may yet win out in spite of our best efforts to resist and evade them and it is the fear that comes with that which fundamentally undermines any illusion that we can be truly free from slavery without abolition.Thats the goalpost and it has never moved.,CapitalismVSocialism,d4qmpct,2,t5_3cct3

8251366,0,t1_d58x20a,gt Such mechanism merely address the symptoms not the root disease.The root disease in this case is the State. What a large number of Right Anarchists seem to get wrong quite often is thatthey think that Democracy will lead to a Socialist State were people simplyvote themselves raises. This creates all sorts of fallacious thinking that isobviously wrong from a outside observer.The reality is that Democracy is impotent. Political action is impotent. Thestate runs the elections counts the ballots decides the rules for elegability.Its trivial for them to control the elections and political parties in such away that the people in power always benefit from any outcome of any election.Here is how it all breaks downA Welfare or other schemes keep poor people docile and easily controlled. It isdifficult to understand the amount you are receiving from the state is much lessthen the state gains from exploiting you.B Welfare is used to justify higher income taxes. Income taxes are designed tomaintain the class structure and prevent competition for the wealthy elite. Income tax should be called wage tax and is very progressive. Very rich peopleonly pay capital gains tax which is usually very flat. Even in very socialistcountries like France this is true.To break out of wage dependence a middle class person must first pay income taxon their earnings. They must then invest it and then pay capital gains tax ontheir returns or invest it in secondary businesses which have a whole host ofother taxes.Very rich people only pay capital gains and they only pay based on what theyconvert to money for their personal spending. The bulk of their wealth isendlessly recycled and is never taxed significantly.Thus income taxes are designed to keep the middle class firmly in their placeand reduce the competition for the traditionally wealthy elite.C In the USA and I suspect most other countries there exist a Central Bank.In the USA this is the Federal Reserve Bank which is ran by board membersappointed by the largest national banks MorganChase BoA Wells Fargo etcThis means that the banks simply bailed themselves out.In addition to that they did this by through government bond auctioning schemes.Aka printing money. This means money supply is inflated. Lets not forget that the poor are continuously maneuvered into situations where theyincur crippling debt. The money received by the banks from their central bankis used to finance more debt and more extraction of wealth from the otherclasses.In a modern society this is how you tax the poor without them realizing it. Theysee the wealth gap increasing and costs of commodities increasing via inflationbut its difficult to see and understand the exact reason why.Which makes this statement you madegt while the proportion of legal burdens endured by the poor and homeless far  exceeds the legal burdens endured by the rich bankers.Possibly the understatement of the century. The Rich bankers do not have anylegal burdens that they have to endure that they dont want to endure. Theycan only exist as rich bankers due to these burdens. Without them they wouldneed to work for honest pay just like everybody else.This is why you have the somewhat puzzling situation were the ultrarichadvocate higher taxes. They benefit far more from higher taxes then they willever pay themselves! They gain significantly from the state government programs thatinvolves massive taxes increasing debt and corresponding spending.So in a large way I am certainly agreeing with you.Which makes this statementgt both are the old scheme take money from everyone and give to others because a  politician say soBoth correct and wrong at the same time depending on how you want to view it.All actions performed by the state benefits the people that run the state andpeople who are closely aligned with the state to the detriment of poor andmiddle class individuals.Banker bailouts cause the bankers to get rich and the poorer to get poorer. Thewelfare state keeps the poor poor and the rich rich and the middle class slavingaway for a comfortable future that is robbed from them through taxation.Just because the politicians say so is a true statement then. People go alongwith the program because they are convinced usually delusionally that somehowthe state can be exploited for their own benefit.,CapitalismVSocialism,d58z6a0,1,t5_3cct3

There people would include all those impacted by the crime the criminal and a person that is possible picked by the community to set a time for them to meet and make sure nothing happens and so on. Racism is a product of capitalism. I hope there are no racist communities as they would need someone to drop some science on them.

And where do I do that?about  different places the most recent being where you first say a minority of people couldnt control resources in a political scheme that idealizes common ownership and then admit there is need for an administration to control those resources.

Because as I stated already the issue is the corruption of the administration. Which is inherent in any political system. And which Im sorry you just cant escape no matter how hard you sophist.The USSR was the greatest attempt at communism. They failed.

I have a sphere of freedom which includes my body and I am entitled to make decisions about what is done within this sphere of freedom.

Come on dude...are you even trying or just trying to troll?gt Private property is still very hierarchical and centralizedPrivate property isnt hierarchical.  There is no hierarchy required to own property.  You dont need people above or below you and an infinite number of people can have the exact same ownership of said property.  There CAN be a hierarchy in property but there can be a hierarchy in personal property as well.Private property isnt centralized.  Property in America is made up of millions and millions of owners thats not what centralization means.  If property was owned or mostly owned by one grouporganization then would could say it was centralized in said area.Your definition of state Capitalism is a traditional definition of command economy and its usually associated with countries who claim to be Communistic and Socialistic.,CapitalismVSocialism,d6tos8v,0,t5_3cct3

Some good came out of it the rejection of the stranglehold on polity by bourgeois amp clerical groups the birth of a sense of nationalism distinct from the monarch the sweeping away of vestiges of the old feudal order. It was also responsible for the spread of a variety of Enlightenment values materialism rationalism universalism parliamentarism secularism the cult of the individual. Opposition or at least reaction to the legacy of the French Revolution is what drove the growth of both socialism and fascism. Conservative Revolutionary philosopher Arthur Moeller van den Bruck had some interesting things to say on it. His views are essentially the same as those of most radical conservatives fascists and traditionalistsgtThe materialist outlook is anthropomorphic. It does not lift man metaphysically above and beyond himself but rationalistically drags him down to what it conceives to be his real self. It was the rationalist age of enlightenment that saw the birth of this philosophy. Up to that time mans thought had always been cosmic it had found its justification in the divine justice and the divine holiness. It was conscious of a spiritual immanence. The rationalists pride was to see only the animal in man. The humanist had stressed the mystic tie that binds the creature to the Creator. The rationalist created lhomme machine a living automaton a miracle of mud. Creation was explained not through the Creator but through the creature and the creature was reduced to the sum of the matter of which he was composed and on which he was nourished. Rousseaus vegetative ideal which aimed at being philanthropic only added a sentimental touch. The French Revolution put these theories politically to the test and demanded rights for the enlightened man expressly based on his physical needs.gtGerman thought rebelled against this degradation of man. German minds took heed of the spiritual as well as the bodily needs of man and evolved the conception of the education of the Human Race by which all that had been lost might be rewon. Their interpretation of universal history had nothing to do with a mechanical Progress but passionately sought to recapture for man the ideals he had abandoned. Our escape from rationalism to idealism was signalized by the attentions being directed not to human rights but to human dignity...gt ...The value of a philosophy of life must be measured by its effects does it raise men or lower them? Reason turned thinking man into calculating man. It corrupted Europe. The World War was the shipwreck of the age of reason. It exposed the cunning of that practical calculation that is the national philosophy of England which gives a moral justification to an immoral conduct of life and state and to the tutelage of other nations which invented the word utilitarianism to cover egotism. It exposed the bankruptcy of the rights of man with which the French Revolution in the name of democracy cheated the nations of their nationality while it reserved for a political caste at the top the exploitation of the people. The fight against the age of reason which we are entering on is a fight against liberalism all along the line. ,CapitalismVSocialism,d6yhe7d,1,t5_3cct3

In my view everyone who does high value public service work like that should get incentives.I dont find your pointgt Education is readily available for anyoneconvincing. Becoming a doctor still requires a lot of dedication and work and certainly a passion for the field. For example I dont think I have what it takes to become a doctor.

Not sure how high value that is but in any way Cleaning toilets is a job you can do even if you dont have a lot of skills.

Yes theyre not saying it under the banner of capitalism but thats what it is. Imperialist wars werent carried out in the name of profit and capital accumulation they were carried out in the name of conquest and national glory. Colonies were pretty universally unprofitable and business interests except for really specific ones like arms manufacturers for example tended to be pretty antiwar throughout the th century since war is generally bad for business. The supporters of imperialism were conservatives and nationalists not liberals.gtSo to point to communist countries as the only political ideology to have a high death count is true if you just want to completely lack nuance in the way you analyze political economics. I mean if you just look at countries actively trying to implement a particular ideology communist ones pretty much have the worst results across the board.

They way you allocate resources is via a gift economy that works based upon the fulfillment of need.Let me try to break it down because I think I see where youre missing somethinggt Also without money and markets theres little way of knowing where its worth it to put your efforts to improve things.This is untrue. Plain and simply you put your efforts into producing things that humans need to live. Money is just arbitrary language that tries to make a number out of that. There is no need for either it or markets when your motive is no longer profit but is instead human fulfillment.You change the mode of production to actually ensure that every human has enough to survive and live comfortably. Since these are biological factors people can say what they need more or less of at the community level without the need for money to mediate it. Money only complicates matters unnecessarily and allows people to accumulate power and resources that others then do not have access to.

While I see the point your making and the point I overlooked Im still unsure it would be that clear cut. So yes breaking the agreement to gain market share would be in the companies self interest. Thats assuming it works. I dont have the time to find out what it was from but iirc I read something once that said back when TVs were still made in America the various Japanese companies started selling TVs at a loss on purpose. The reasoning being that by selling at a loss for a while which they could afford to do with Japanese conglomerates being  known for taking the long view and that the American manf. would be unable to compete and it eventually worked. So yes breaking the agreement would be worth itbut only if it works and by breaking it your risking the other  ganging up in some fashion like the above example of Japanese companiesSo if Im part of a  company cabal and you leave and try to break the agreement selling   I use the combined power of the other  companies to ruin you. Most likely the  have more cash than the  allowing them to afford a strategy like selling at a loss. Or the  companies start making closed standards only products from the big  can use a lighting port or some nonsense that then becomes the defacto standards bc we control more market share. So even if your product is better and cheaper you can be beaten just bc your cash reserves are smaller.,CapitalismVSocialism,d7k0dvg,1,t5_3cct3

Its the measure by which you can tell how much value a commodity has. The measurement itself is less important than the concept which is the basis for exploitation but it still exists and you can ascribe the value of a commodity on this basis.gtThe most obvious criticism of LTV is that labour time is only process to be socially necessary at the point of consumption do its not a labour theory of value any more than its a consumption theory of value.Your typos here make this passage hard to understand but if Im getting your point correct youre saying that the LTV posits that value is only obtained once the thing is purchased?gtBut its isnt really a quantification of value at all because if you dont personally care for someone to consume the finished product then the labor time has no value to you. If you dont personally care for someone to consume the thing  and Im not sure what you mean by this the commmodification process exists to exchange commodities so if it exists on the marketplace there was some hint of demand for it at some point and you do care that someone would consume it because that means youd make money off of it... but regardless if you dont care that someone consumes it then no... it doesnt have value. It has usevalue if you intend to use it for you and you only.gtValue cannot be determined in any objective senseYes. It can.

Matter and form substance and accident Ive looked at it all a ton and can tell that theres real philosophical depth there. If anyone can convert me I think its Aquinas because I genuinely love his work which is slightly awkward to do outside of Rome Ill admit.But in spite of all that for the life of me I just cant make sense of this doctrine. From how I understand Aristotle the substance is what places something in a category and accidents are just where they happen to be within that category. But if every possible difference I can think of between bread and flesh seems to be saying its bread I think I should just conclude that its bread. To try to look at substance any deeper that I can think of being food made of dough of flour and water as being accidental to it I dont think Im dealing with bread substance anymore but simply substance. It presents far too many issues and when there is a much simpler nonliteral readings that explain this all without problem and considering how much Jesus gave way to parables and comparison Is Jesus literally a lamb? Is he literally light of the world? The true vine? A gate? why should I not apply Occams Razor?This really does put me in a weird space spiritually then.

But Im not and no authority I do recognizes persuades me otherwise.

9162738,0,t3_55t0kv,gtIf anything whats wrong with my analogy?    Loans are made based on cash flows. No one loans to someone who has nothing produces nothing and then expects to be paid back with more. Similarly the banking sector loans to everyone else based on their cash flows and productivity or expected productivity in case of a college student or startup company.    gtIs it true that even if everyone pays their debt the there is not enough money to pay the interest?    No and this has been mathematically demonstrated by neoclassical economists but I fail to find the analysis at this time as its rarely addressed anymore. As I recall the rebuttal analysis correctly the setup is incorrect and goes back to the fact that debt is a liability stock and that repayment including interest is a portion of asset flows. Any repayment is used by the banking sector to buy their own goods and services and increase loans which flows right back to that debtor sector as income. Maybe its easier to think of it in terms of more concrete physiocratic terms. Imagine that a bank has lbs of grain which is all that exists in the world. The debtor sector borrows that lbs eats lbs to live and the banker sector eats lbs to live and sows the lbs in the earth. Come harvest times they are able to reap lbs. lbs is eaten again the other lbs is sown and lbs is given as repayment lbs interest   lbs principle. This process can go on for years until repayment is complete.   Similarly any loans to business are expected to produce actual goods and services that are of greater value than the cost of production  PampI payments.

It works in the long term never the short term. Decisions made today such as Obama changing the Oath of Allegiance to remove the vow to defend the United States works a subtle effort towards a true horror show in the future towards the gradual deconstruction of our military as an important guardian and expression of The American Will.Sweden is an example of the cancer when it works far along you see the Slippery Slope in spite of being accused of being a fallacy tends to be correct in a great many cases. When Conservatives said that you open up Marriage to Gays youll start seeing incest bestiality so on push to be socially accepted they were correct for the most partThe leftist concept of progress never stops and the most modern conservatives do is try and hold the progress off for a few years never roll it back. Most leftists however are caught up in the moment so barely any of them think to the future they so believe that what theyre doing is progress that they almost seem to think progress will end in their lifetime that all the civil activist groups that people spent years working for will seemingly just fade away rather than find new things to fightgenerally with more viciousness than before!No leftist ever thinks We create an environment more tolerant for Trans people and THEN what? Not a single one imagines anything coming after that they simply concern themselves with the here and the now.They do this because the fundamental argument the philosophy behind it always remains the same there is nothing sacred dignified or transcendental about human life. Humans are so undignified so secularized that one cannot stop something simply because it undermines the basically dignity of our society or violates the sacredness of the body.Instead of seeing Transexuality as something perhaps brought on by children not developing a healthy identity in society or the constant war against the Masculine that feminists are raging on about we see it as a permanent interest group that needs to be an everlasting part of our society.Let me give you an example of how absurd this has gotten theres a kind of body dysmorphia whereby a person may think one of their limbslike their armisnt really their arm and so they ask their doctor to remove it. In almost all cases the doctor naturally refuses. Its absurd to say that someone has someone elses arm patently insane almost... and yet at the same time we see people believe they were born with the wrong gender and so we can cut anything off to correct that mistake without the slightest bit of concern over the example were stating.A woman who wanted to be blind had Drain Cleaner poured in her eyes by a sympathetic psychologist she was born with perfectly healthy eyes but simply desired blindness for seemingly no reason. Now she can laze around and collect welfare for deliberately giving up her eyesight.Is it bigotry or intolerance to find this woman to be utterly fucking insane? Why is she anymore insane than anyone else when weve bought into this belief that theres no permanent features to a person that anything can and should be changed to make oneself comfortable?Have you read  no that isnt a typo by any chance? Its a good dystopian novel but theres one part that I particularly like Ill try to keep the spoilers to a minimum. The main character being a history teacher or historian Ill admit Im a bit forgetful is giving a lecture on the History of England where the novel takes place. Everything starting from the times of the first Saxon Kings all the way to their modern dystopia. One of the peculiar things he and his class notices is that as time progresses forward and forward to the present things seem to get ethereal. Whereas once there were genuine answers to questions a yes or no a this major event lasted from X to Y an easy understanding of history and the human actors involved it suddenly became hard to gauge anything about the modern times why people were doing what they were doing how what are the groups involved.Were moving more and more towards this strange new society where people seem to be dipping deeper and deeper into this great pool of absurdity and drinking until their bellies are full.Leftist politics thusly is the gradual progression of society down two dark paths classical liberalism and socialism each going to horrifically sinister places.,CapitalismVSocialism,d8f73cd,2,t5_3cct3

They build up their savings they start their business they live off of those savings pay costs including OTHER PEOPLES WAGES until such time as they achieve profitability if at all.

9269517,0,t1_d8qyst1,And a supplemental quote from heregtDeduct from the value of a commodity the value replacing the value of the raw materials and other means of production used upon it that is to say deduct the value representing the past labour contained in it and the remainder of its value will resolve into the quantity of labour added by the working man last employed. If that working man works twelve hours daily if twelve hours of average labour crystallize themselves in an amount of gold equal to six shillings this additional value of six shillings is the only value his labour will have created. This given value determined by the time of his labour is the only fund from which both he and the capitalist have to draw their respective shares or dividends the only value to be divided into wages and profits. It is evident that this value itself will not be altered by the variable proportions in which it may be divided amongst the two parties. There will also be nothing changed if in the place of one working man you put the whole working population twelve million working days for example instead of one.gtSince the capitalist and workman have only to divide this limited value that is the value measured by the total labour of the working man the more the one gets the less will the other get and vice versa. Whenever a quantity is given one part of it will increase inversely as the other decreases. If the wages change profits will change in an opposite direction. If wages fall profits will rise and if wages rise profits will fall. If the working man on our former supposition gets three shillings equal to one half of the value he has created or if his whole working day consists half of paid half of unpaid labour the rate of profit will be  percent because the capitalist would also get three shillings. If the working man receives only two shillings or works only one third of the whole day for himself the capitalist will get four shillings and the rate of profit will be  per cent. If the working man receives four shillings the capitalist will only receive two and the rate of profit would sink to  percent but all these variations will not affect the value of the commodity. A general rise of wages would therefore result in a fall of the general rate of profit but not affect values.And a final quote from heregtYou would be altogether mistaken in fancying that the value of labor or any other commodity whatever is ultimately fixed by supply and demand. Supply and demand regulate nothing but the temporary fluctuations of market prices. They will explain to you why the market price of a commodity rises above or sinks below its value but they can never account for that value itself.More of my own emphasis. Invoice in the mail.

In order for capitalism to exist there had to be a violent process called primitive accumulation whereby all means of production were forcibly privatized. Moreover these private property rights have to be upheld and expanded through coercion in the form of the police courts the armed forces etc.             gtalmost all socialists believe in personal property         Yeah. Personal property is not private property. Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labor of others by means of such appropriation.          Private property is any property used to extract surplus value from workers or exact a rent. Having a car or a house to use andor share with others is personal property hiring someone else to drive your car as a taxi or renting out your house are both examples of private property.             gtNot all socialists believe that private property should be eliminated.

My response is that youre wrong because the labor theory of value is right? Thats not an argument thats begging the question!

All of the participants of a production process must have access to the fruits of their labor. Otherwise you wont be very happy about it. This is especially vital to cooperative reasoning. When you dont consider you and some other person a we when it comes to rewards you also dont consider yourselves a we when it comes to executing some task. This leads to indifference low job satisfaction alienation and eventually corruption negligence depression nihilism... the whole affair.An illustration While they have a fairly good understanding of each others mental processes chimps are horrible at executing even the most rudimentary cooperative tasks. Bonobos on the other hand get that sort of thing figured out very quickly. Why? Because bonobos share chimps dont. Bonobos think less of the I and more of the we. Humans are even more amazing at doing this. We are the best at cooperating and especially thinking about cooperating. No animal reasons about cooperation like we do and we do it best when we distribute the rewards fairly.

9720906,0,t3_5ebp22,The Free World encompassed more than half of the world back then so you cant say it was an autarky. Few centuries ago autarky was prevailing in every single state especially in the Middle Ages. If we go even further into judging this we can say that even every single village was an autarky since all the people were trying to live with what they produced in their households. The kings and the noblemen would import clothes and books from other countries but besides them no imports or exports were made on a regular basis.Now that I have talked about the past of this regime I shall talk about the present and how it would affect me. First of all it would be really bad for me mostly because all the products I am using are not from my country  Romania. This very forum I am browsing now would not be available to me if I was living in an autarky. The music I listen to wouldnt be available either and I can also add video games and all the forms of entertainment. In an autarky only the basis of the needs pyramid would be fulfilled. So my opinion about it is really bad.Globalism and World communism is definitely not a form of autarky because we have nothing else to trade with and thus we are not closed. We could call it autarky if there were aliens to trade with us and suddenly we would stop trading with them but until then we are confined to this planet and thus globalism is not an autarky.,CapitalismVSocialism,dabbaho,3,t5_3cct3

The concept of US rightlibertarianism is a con. A truly free market is a perfectly competitive market. Which means that whatever you have to sell in that market so does your competition. Which means price war. Which means your price gets driven down. Which means little or no profit for you. Businesses flee perfectly competitive markets like the plague. In fact the fine art of doing so is a big part of what they teach in business schools.Thats why businesses use strategies like product differentiation so their competition is no longer selling the exact same product they are. Thats why they use strategies like branding so their buyers dont think the products are the same. Businesses will in fact do almost anything to get out of the hell of pure headtohead competition.They dont do it because theyre crooked they do it because they have an intrinsic economic incentive to.

9893006,0,t1_dawfy2s,Yeah I am. Studied it in undergrad too I just enjoy the subject.I wouldnt deny theres a logical possibility that a given public agency can be more efficient but that mere possibility isnt really that interesting to me by itself.The point is more that public firms dont really face economic competition at all its political competition. So for example its true the family restaurant in a small town may have some monopolistic elements e.g. facing a downward sloping demand curve. But theyre still constrained by other actually  potentially existing firms in the town producing close substitutes e.g. fast food and notsoclosesubstitutes e.g. buying groceries instead of eating there and thereby cannot just raise their prices as they wish. We can still think of markets as being competitive regardless of the number of firms once we avoid thinking only in terms of static models of perfect competition. Im thinking instead of something like Baumols notion of contestable markets which still exhibit competitive behavior even when the number of competitors is very small so long as we have free entry and exit. And its the constraints put on them by the need to make profits  avoid losses that accounts for this.Compare this with public firms. There is no competition in the sense of trying to increase profitability precisely because they are not constrained by the need to increase profitability and  or avoid losses.  Because theres no competition theres not even a tendency in the direction of making things more efficient if they do become more efficient its almost a matter of sheer luck. The point here is that while both public firms and private firms can make inefficient mistakes the institutions within which public entities are working do not provide reliable mechanisms to identify and  or fix those inefficiencies whereas market institutions do even if those markets arent perfectly competitive.,CapitalismVSocialism,dax2ymn,1,t5_3cct3

Also new information was very cheap before science and technology became so important but now we are getting very deep into the realm diminishing returns. It takes large effort of many highly educated and specialised people to discover or invent something new.My understanding of the concept of resource scarcity is that it involves the cost of distributing said resource to people thus requiring a limiting mechanism typically markets to arbitrate who gets how much. I do not see any physical resourcebased cost in distributing the fruits of knowledgediscovery freely. Is there some way that this is reflected in physical resource scarcity at least indirectly? If so that would be the only way I could conceive of through which the term scarce could truly apply to informationknowledge. gt Do you have any idea what kind of masive bureaucratic apparatus would be necessary to govern the whole economy according to some silly manual of professions? How could it possibly deal with pseudoscience or obscure fields with next to zero impact on the real world?A the products of art would be handled rather straightforwardly in the labor voucher economy not really any differently from other goodsservices. Labor voucher issuance would adjust supply to better meet consumer demand just like for any other product. B As far as obscure fields like in basic science research that may or may not be valuable several years later it could simply be made a social cost. Making some areas of basic science research a social cost is essentially how most modern nations deal with it. The only difference is that they do this with taxes while a labor voucher economy would do so with issuance of labor vouchers. Just like in a money economy that funds basic science research this will lead to some degree of waste but it is necessary to fund basic science research. Accountability for such areas of research could involve similar methods used currently. gt govern the whole economy according to some silly manual of professionsThat wouldnt even be necessary. gt Say I am a researcher and I want to spend my life developing yet another paralel theory in the fruitless fieldAddressed above point B. gt You keep spamming your ideas as if you have the perfect solutionI like discussing ideas of political economy with people and learning from them. gt but as soon as you get critical follow up questionSome of the follow up questions I get are critical from an intellectual basis.

Was that way for the majority of my life taught that way in school in University shaped that way by my culture by the news I read by the entertainment I consumed by the idols I cherished. I was not really a person yet I was a mishmash of other peoples ideas. For the longest time my life had no meaning. I saw the world a certain way but it made less and less sense to me. Id hear opinions that seemed alien to me and automatically assumed the people I was talking to were idiots malicious or brainwashed. I couldnt understand people that didnt think like me and that irked me for a long time.It disturbed me so much I started venturing down a different road. Id start reading media I once found horrifying. Started reading books that I would have dismissed entirely before. Though Id say what really fucked me up for a long time was George Orwells Road to Wigan Pier. How he wrote about the aristocratic Left made me realize... He was describing me. I didnt so much care for the poor for the working class I just hated those who had more than me. This wrecked me for a long time.That was about three years ago. I didnt realize it at the time but Id become so disillusioned that I started internalizing ideas I would have rejected before. I became a complete reactionary. Started obsessively consuming material from what most would consider alt right. It just clicked for me the lens I viewed the world before had blinded me to the truth and I was now seeing things clearly!Of course this was no better than where I was before I was just reading from a different script. It took me a long while to realize that but in retrospect it was an important part of my development. Seeing things from both sides has helped me become the person I am today.

Conversely if you refuse to cooperate on resources and share your abundance with other members of a societal partnership what is the point of even maintaining the partnership? What do they get out of it? In other words if others are getting less comfort than you out of this partnership for their participation what does that say about the partnership?If you deserve all your resources you must have created it all yourself and therefore do not need others or cooperative society. So why give them anything at all?,CapitalismVSocialism,dbonn9l,1,t5_3cct3

In this regard they fulfill one of the roles of money quite accurately.However because labor is directly social the value of good and labor vouchers are of equal measureproportion.  Therefore  hour of labor vouchers will only ever acquire  hour of the total social product.  While this does not mean that someone cant trade  hours of labor vouchers for something that only takes  hour to produce the  hours of labor vouchers which they traded will still only ever acquire  hours of the total social product when expended legitimately.gt Do you imagine that  billion people on the planet will use the same LVs?They dont need to use the same LVs whatever that means.  The physical from of the LV is irrelevant Im pretty certain they wont even have physical form at this stage.gt  Or there wont be regional or even national differences?Differences in what sense?  In the physical form?gt Basically when you get to the bottom of it youll find LVs are no different than money.The question is can they be used as money?

10146058,0,t1_dbtsj6t,gtBut if theyre different qualitatively then how is it that we can ever say that  bushels of wheat equals  bushels of corn? That is how can exchange of distinct quantities occur?Any capitalist would say through the forces of supply and demand which you admit are real and present.   But since your argument is that the amount of labor is directly proportional to the value of the producct why does it vary so much from location to location?  Why is it so much cheaper to buy anything in Taiwan than it is in the U.S. ?  Surely the labor needed to maintain an apartment in rural Taiwan is about equal to the labor needed to maintain an apartment in NYC?  Are capitalists in NYC simply exploiting their workers for more?  Or is an apartment actually worth more in NYC than it is in rural Taiwan for reasons other than labor?  Reasons such as convenience and prestige.  Now these you say may only reflect the items qualitative value but isnt that after already assuming the labor theory of value?  You cant use a theory to prove itself.  You also might say that the price is different but not the qualitative value.  But would you not give up more goats to live in NYC than to live in rural Taiwan?  Surely the commodity of exchange doesnt matter.gtIn bourgeois economics theres a lot of talk about equilibrium price. The question for Marx isnt what is the equilibrium price? Its what explains this equlibrium priceBut there isnt one set equilibrium price for everything.  A bushel of wheat may be worth . in Boston and . in Kansas City. gt But that it appears relatively stable at all is an absolute mystery and unexplained phenomena for subjective valuation.Its not a mystery the value remains stable because the capital needed to produce the object remains stable for a particular area it varies from place to place without the labor power needed to produce a waffle varying at all.  It takes the same amount of labor to produce a waffle in Belgium as in Antartica.  But why is the one in Antartica valued so much higer?  Surely other factors play  into its evaluation.  However if youre simply looking at the global average of all eveluations of Waffles then the labor theory of value might fit nicely but it doesnt actually affect the value of the object in reality.If the labor theory of value were true then why does fiat currency work effectively?  Its not backed up by any tangible commodity.  The labor that went into producing a hundred dollar bill is the same as the one but they still hold value.  Why?gtThe simple answer to this is that they must actually have a shared substance that is qualitatively equal which Marx determined to be abstract labor. This is then what constitutes value.Youre assuming this is true to make a point.  Youre always asking what if the labor wasnt there? well what if the entrepreneur wasnt there?  Those laborers would still be doing something that is less economically efficient than they would be if the entrepreneur hired them.  Just because an idea doesnt hold tangible value in Marxs definition doesnt mean it doesnt make a tangible difference on society.  In effect your banana idea multiplied the banana output x the labor didnt suddenly become remarkably better you added something albeit something that wasnt labor to cause that massive increase in productive efficiency.  Yet in the theory of labor it is worth nothing.gtSo while these things do not produce value they may constitute a higher share of the total surplus coming your way.How do they not produce value?  The value of a television is far less than what it was  years ago.  The labor was made more efficient not by their own ingenuity but by the ingenuity of someone else entirely.  Yet that person is exploiting his workers out of whatever profit hes making on the exchange.  How?  The value change was entirely due to him.  You cant just apply your theory and claim its true without adressing that things have value outside of labor  such as ideas.gt But simply because it is worthy does not mean it has actually produced the value.  Yes it did had he not taken the risk the value of the product would be different because the labor would not be there.  You might say that the workers could have done it themselves had they owned the means of production.  But really?  I imagine they would be far less efficient because theyre not actually working towards any personal advancement thus the entrepreneur at least brought the value of their increased efficiency by simply being there.  Again this is all assuming that the labor theory of value is true.gtIt is not worthless per se. The value is just not the type of value hes addressing.Your right hes only addressing labor value which is asinine in reality.gtsomeone whos job it is to fold clothes at a retail store does not produce value.Really?  I think an organized shopping experience is pretty valuable even if Marx doesnt agree.  In fact its probably worth paying a premium for.  I could just stuff a bag at the local thrift store but Id much prefer to go to a well organized shopping center.  The clothes may be more expensive.  I am willing to exchange more of any commodity for them so why is it that the folded clothes do not add value?  Is value only in tangible objects?  So does a masseuese add no value to society either?  Thats ridiculous.gt  but without those workers in Taiwan none of that would have been true and that conversation never would have been happening.Without your boss none of it would have happened either.  But for some reason only one party actually provided value according to a very presumtious definition by our friend Marx.  So without your bosss ideas it couldnt have happened and without the workers labor it couldnt have happened.  Yet only one has value because of some preassumed definition?gt Contrary to what youre trying to assert the market fails to address social crises. While it is true that individuals also often fail to address social crises the difference between capitalism and socialism is that once enough individuals do realize the greater social cost no individuals who beg to differ for whatever motives can stand in their way.The only reasons capitalism fails is because of incomplete property rights its impossible to own the sky.  If every piece of property extended upwards and were completely seperate from each other somehow people wouldnt pollute to avoid dirtying their own enviroment.  gtYou think DAPL would be building their pipeline if the major owners got their water from the Missouri river up there? No theyre off the scene man totally disconnected from the concrete value and risks and only concerned with the abstract value and risks.The question and your own response to your question dont align.  If they were personally drinking from the Missouri river no they wouldnt intentionally put it in harms way.  But youre right in that they probably wouldnt do that.  My point is that if you could isolate every externality then it wouldnt matter to anyone else what they do on their own property and they would at least have a pretty strong incentive not to destroy it.,CapitalismVSocialism,dbu1972,1,t5_3cct3

10185156,0,t1_dbyadjy,I have a bunch of fragments but theyre not really ordered or stitched together at all.Identity theory. What is the self what am I really? Am I separate from my environment or am I a part of it? Am I the bootstrapped source of my achievements or am I irreversibly beholden to everything that made my life possible the way it is? Is my consciousness real or am I just another thing? Am I one individual or are there multiple entities in my brain that add up to who I seem to be? Am I persistent or am I ephemeral thats to say are the past me the current me and the future me all the same individual? Ownership assumes the discreteness of the individual. Its dualistic and artificial whereas the naturalreal world is more variegated.Ownership is a spook as Stirner would put it. Stewardship is more of a descriptor of how things interact in a positive way.Community rights. This is also philosophically heavier and its the least developed part. Its a way of answering the question of who has a right to exist through time largely from an ecological perspective. It says that the communities that exist have a right to keep on existing with all that this entails. Its okay to hunt a few game animals as long as the herd survives and flourishes. Cutting wood is okay as long as the integrity of the forest is preserved. Its okay to mine as long as you dont turn the area into a barren death pit. Its not a tragedy if one species is lost as long as there are organisms similar enough to it and biodiversity is robust.It was not given to you by your parents it was loaned to you by your children. Uti non abuti. Stewardship.Its said that everything that you own in a sense also owns you. Keeping something for your own use means it exerts a pull on you whether through storing it maintaining it keeping it safe just keeping track of it feeling like you have to use it and even the psychological effect of associating oneself with it.There are many things that people say they want to own but what they really want is access. One doesnt need a garage with  cars sitting idle half the time and in parking lots for another third one needs to be able to use the car that they need. One doesnt need to buy ones own closetful of novelty outfits when theres easy community access to them. One doesnt need an extensive personal library when there are public libraries. One doesnt need a sizable yard if they have a good park and their own garden plot just a stones throw away. All this saves enormous amounts of time material and space reducing and in some cases eliminating scarcity and bringing people together. Access over ownership.Ownership says that something is entirely subordinate to you and that your will over it is absolute. Stewardship says that something is connected to you you decide how it is used but you have obligations as well. Ownership says that you have your house for example because you have a title to it and that title is protected by law. Stewardship says that you have your house because youre the one who lives in it maybe you even built part of it you have a personal attachment to it and you have a better use for it than anyone else.In stewardship theres still a my and mine but its more fluid and understood in a more relational way rather than an absolute one. My town my family my home my take on this these are all things weve always had an understanding of but never called it ownership. Ownership began at the dawn of settled civilization when people looked away from what they needed to live and focused on abstract concepts of wealth. These abstractions just kept coming and compounding money lordship and divine right the nationstate stock exchanges bona fide currency financial derivatives. None of these create the kind of value that enriches our lives rather they separate us from what we are ultimately dependent on.,CapitalismVSocialism,dbyjl28,1,t5_3cct3
10188149,0,t1_dbyrwxx,I already explained this above. I dont know what it is but you leftists seem to really love writing extremely long posts that tend to be obfuscating and beg more questions than they answer.To argue successfully against Hayek you need to show a the people computers etc. doing the planning have access to the tacit inarticulate knowledge that is dispersed throughout society and b the system generates information such that we know when resources are being misallocated in terms of consumer valuations and how we should respond to those changes and have the right incentive structure so individuals exploit that knowledge.You cited the Cockshott and Cottrell paper and its really an embarrassment.

I do not say this as an Austrian economist. Im just an economist with formal training in the subject at the undergraduate and graduate level. If youll notice even some of the marxists  socialists in the thread were highly supportive of my argument against LV style planning with some of them saying I had conclusively rendered it to be dysfunctional.

Its called Intellectual Property which is a state granted monopoly.

Since ancaps share your fear we strive for an armed society that could revolt against a company that tried to install a government.gt How you can be unconcerned by that is breathtaking and not a positive reflection on your thinking.We are not unconcerned in fact its one of the criticisms that we fully embrace and resolve. Please make a post where you raise your concerns wed be happy to debate them.gt So sayeth the Book of Ancappery amen.Which would that be?

You could call our library of economic thought a holy book but it seems like you have no intent on teaching yourself some basic economics. Instead of calling us bigoted believers and insult us you could make an actual argument  but unfortunately our ideology is highly consistent so you gonna have a bad time.At least we dont praise some German lunatic whos only achievement in his life was writing Das Kapital among other book I do not recall.gt I set the price of the good in question rent and I use my earnings to crush anything that looks like competitionI dont see an argument. How can I crush competition using profits? The only way to do that is to lower prices which reduces profits and thus prices cant be held low indefinitely or increase productivity aka investment. If I lower prices or increase productivity everyone is better off so theres no problem in that. Monopolies arent bad per se theres nothing inherently wrong with having only one supplier for Stephen King books they only turn bad once they raise prices or reduce quality. Then however competition arises that produces with lower prices andor better quality. Of course it doesnt follow directly that all monopolies will eventually turn bad and lose to competition but being a monopoly tends to make one lazy or greedy see government bureaucrat which reduces quality or raises prices respectively. Thus benevolent monopolies remain  as they should  and monopolies gone bad die. For more information on this topic you can have a look at this article and the additional resources Fear of MonopolyBack to Microsoft the claim that the free market made customers dependent and lockedin on technologies provided by Microsoft is not true. According to Independent Institute the book Winners Losers and Microsoft manages to explain Microsofts success from their superiority of products and refute claims regarding customers being lockedin regarding their choicegt Among their surprising findingsgt  Software prices fall dramatically in markets where Microsoft is a major player but prices show no strong tendency to fall over time if Microsoft is not a factor in a given market.gt  Claims that dominant but inferior technologies can lock out better competitive products are not supported by the data. This not only applies to software but also to other technology markets i.e. VHS vs. Beta video recorder battles.gt  Superior products tend to dominate in high technology even if inferior products are backed by lots of money.

10292643,0,t1_dcap4nj,You asked me for an example of just domination. Since just and unjust are normative claims I provided an example that in my opinion would be just. Murder means unlawful killing. It is possible to have an unjust police force which arrests people for murder in unjust ways or for unjust reasons. In other words they may arrest people whose acts of murder were just. However all I was saying was that a police officer forcibly arresting someone for murder is not inherently unjust as there are situations in which that action by the officer would be just. So regardless my example holds up as an example of a potentially just form of domination. My simple definition of just domination that I adhere to would be the followingForms of domination which actively prevent unjust forms of domination from occurring.

Except that here were dealing with a committee whose task is extremely limited and narrowlydefined. And this task doesnt include production decisions. Which is the crux of the argument here really. gt I think this is it. Bankers are just more lazy than anyone else. your comment....I dont agree. The main thing that bankers do for an economy is calculate efficient distribution of resources. The main thing I argued there isnt that it would be an arduous task. Its that the added value which WOULD justify that just isnt there if you compare to the way they currently do things. gt youre really talking about not that many bytes in terms of digital storageRight but theres more cost than just the storage. the translation of all of it and then the use of all the data to plug into models which would create credit scores predict creditworthiness ect. Were talking now about computing power which can to run continuously in real time. Then youve got the whole issue of its accuracy. If there were serious challenges to its accuracy then the added value from doing that would go south as fast as beliefs about the credibility would. Then itd all have to be backed up to prevent system crashes a flashcrash could be catastophic. While Im no computer engineer I can say that it sounds like itd be expensive enough that there would have to be real tangible added value from doing all of this to justify it all in the first place. In a classical economics sense you might eliminate some information asymmetry thereby coming close to the theoretical efficient market outlined by the Efficientmarket hypothesis but even then there are many who argue that the status que ie private banks and lenders investing the credit worthiness of their counterparties on an individual basis also achieves that at ZERO cost to the taxpayer rendering such an expense unjustifiable. And then there are the political ramifications. Many EU countries have standards about data privacy. And Merkels government in Germany has expressed extreme suspicion about the risk of flashcrashes in the financial markets. So itd be next to impossible to get the Germans to agree to a system which would increase their risk of flashcrash in exchange for possibly negligible economic benefit. And nothing in the EU happens if the Germans are opposed to it.  ,CapitalismVSocialism,dd5h7tu,2,t5_3cct3

I dont think anybody would agree with you.gtAfter about half a century of a consistent monopoly yes.Were talking about how industries will respond to the changing environment of automation and post scarcity. Im really not interested in learning the arcane history of the fucking diamond industry just to win some internet arguments. Maybe its a market failure maybe its not its really not relevant because I never said the market was infallible. Im talking about aggregates here. In general lowering the cost of doing business will lead to lower prices and increased access of goods and services. Thats how its been working for the past hundred years I see no reason to think that will suddenly will turn around.gtI mean they as in the people who hold the means of production..gtSo youre one of those who think private businesses simply operating constitute the entire ideology of capitalism? I was under the impression that a freemarket or a purposeful hierarchy or perfect competition was something youd at least try and intertwine in there. My interpretation of this subreddit is that on the far ends of the spectrum there are AnCaps and on the other there are Pure Socialists. Thats a rough guideline. Id like the think the majority of people fall somewhere in between. That is to say they support socialist policies in industries that have been implementing these policies for centuries or a somewhat centralised planned economy or removal of the class system. But they also support private industries operating and providing jobs. Not many people can say a midway point is particularly bad only that certain policies can be bad. My point here is that there are many people pointing out that capitalism does just fine on its own but it doesnt and it never has. There has always been a state guiding all of us consumers or producers.I can see this getting off into the weeds rather quickly but if you had to put a label on me I would suspect it would be something along the lines of a minarchist. I think the states has a a very defined and limited role and it is aimed at maximizing the principles that make free market capitalism such a great system People being free to take the best option available to them. The most obvious and important aspect of that is freedom nobody should be phyiscally coerced into taking the worse of two or more options and no that doesnt mean starvation is an example of the universe coercing you which is why Im ok with the idea of police a military a justice system. And the other is that people know what their best choice is. This is where it gets murkier and where it can taken to extremes that I wouldnt agree with but in theory I wouldnt be against the idea of antifalse advertising laws and things of that nature. Those two things are primarily what I care about. That being said the reason Im not an ancap or a pure libertarian is because I dont think the best way to secure those rights is through removal of the state. But Im very much against centralization of power and centrally planned economies.gtThe point I was making there was that there are failures in capitalism and there shouldnt be which is why I believe a state should be there to plug the holes. Never once have I said all capitalism is bad or that an entire industry has been a failure only that there are failures and they need to be addressed because the freemarket just doesnt cut it. In addition housing prices have been consistently going up since the last century. They used to be about  months income now they are  times yearly income. If you dont see how thats a market failure then I dont know what to tell you.Whats happening is you have the benefit of arguing for a system that hasnt and likely never will exist otherwise there would be tons of anecdotal instances of failures in it. Yeah there are failures in capitalism I never said otherwise. That doesnt mean any alternative you want to propose is automatically better.Housing prices PER SQUARE FOOT havent been going up. Whats been going up is the size of homes and the prices have gone up accordingly. In the aggregate at least Im sure there are some individual cities where real price per square foot have risen and some where its fallen. Not sure what youre referring to about the  months income vs  years income but that sounds wildly off base. Do you have a source?gtCapitalism operating within a moderately socialist state. None of the other things have anything to do with it. They arent nonfree markets but at no point were they operating alone.Do you not see the problem with the fact that half your post is talking about how bad capitalism is and half your post is talking about how we dont have capitalism? The connection between free markets  capitalism  private property rights has been shown time and time again to increase personal wealth in many countries around the world. If anything weve seen a long slow downward trend in growth rates in the developed world as the regulatory state has increased because it always increases.gtIt will generally mean lower prices but theres no guarantee of stable competition in industries which means there is a possibility for the creation of an artificial scarcity. There are no natural checks and balances to prevent oppression in economics unless you consider the creation of a state to be natural but at that point its no longer pure economicsThere are natural checks and balances the example you give is one where the only reason they were able to control supply is because there were a limited number of mining operations and they bought them all up. The problem with this is that most industries arent like that or at the very least not as susceptible to it and also that information is much more readily available to these companies. Its not so easy to sell the native americans firewater in exchange for land. If some company were going around buying access to all of the oil reserves the remaining owners would notice and react accordingly by demanding higher and higher prices. The fact that some dude was able to pull the wool over peoples eyes a century ago is hardly a reliable example for what will happen in the future in completely different industries. Its just not an argument.gtWhat point do you think Ive been making here? Because I was under the impression that it was artificial scarcities leading to higher prices can and do exist. They do so we can conclude that the same capability could be present in and industry especially given that these are  industries with surprisingly small operating costs.The point is about how capitalism will handle post scarcity. The fact that debeers have consistently lost market share is an argument against your position not for it.,CapitalismVSocialism,ddaqojw,1,t5_3cct3

10618597,0,t1_ddan5e0,Regardless of the degree to which private property wealth is composed of land as well as other capitalized rents e.g. the capitalized value of an anticompetitive laws shows up in the stock price of the benefiting company sides steps my argument. It does not address it.  I argued that such forms of private property are unjust. Similarly were this the s even if the ownership of the capitalized value of labor slavery was a minor component of private property it is still unjust. Its proportion of the total pool of wealth is irrelevant to whether it is just.Second land and economic rent in general is hardly irrelevant. Consider how much home prices are especially in large cities let alone urban centers. Compare a similar home in San Francisco vs Podunkmiddleofnowhere Indiana. The difference is the capitalized value of the rent.  The degree to which the tax code bias some companies over others is growing all the time. This too is an unjust form of wealth.With regards to Facebook it is an example of a network effect.

10726238,0,t1_ddltkap,gtAnticapitalists are more accurately against them being compensated for lending their stuff to others. Im pretty sure thats what you meant.Thats largely true but theres also good reason to be against people owning largescale means of production capital and land! in the sense that its possible for these people to sell this MOP and capital to others.  If its legally possible to sell non personal property its also possible to rent.  But obviously market socialism has no objection to owning and selling personal propertythis process is integral to the functioning of the economy.There are some blurry lines here that a socialist politysociety would have to work out by developing clearly defined norms delineating the boundaries between personal property and means of productioncapital assets.  These norms would need to be reinforced in our educational systems.  So for example I might own a vehicle for personal use but it would be considered unethical in socialism for me to rent this car out to other people at a profit to myself.  Now no one is seriously arguing that it should be unethical for me to ask for a modest premium for the use of my personal vehicle say filling up the gas tank or buying me some beer.  However it would be a threat to socialist norms if I started buying up cars and renting them in a systematic way.  The bottom line for socialists is that the worker should never be dependent on renting capital assets from another individual in order to work and survive.  The worker should if qualified be able to obtain those capital assets from a socially owned pot.gtWhy shouldnt capitalists profit from their capital contributions as well as their labor contributions? I suppose the classic example of this is a workplace where one of the workers ownssupplies the necessary tools and demands reasonably that since he is supplying the tools he should get a greater percentage of the future profits.  While this is eminently practical and reasonable in some contexts its no longer necessary in a society where the forces of production are sufficiently developed to socialize the means of production.  We dont actually need people to own capital....in fact there are very good reasons war ecological degradation imperialism to believe that largescale capital ownership and capital accumulation guaranteed by the state has had devastating effects upon contemporary developed society where an elite of capital owners has obtained control over the state and society and now threatens us with totalitarian class domination via technology.We dont need owners in our modern economy to get things done because we can socialize capital ownership so that if an enterprise needs capital they appeal to a public bank to obtain what they need from a socially owned pot.  This way we can avoid relations of subservience to capital owners in exchange for them supplying their capital because communities are wealthy enough to supply that capital socially.  gtKeep in mind that selling a finished product that you own but didnt produce is just as much an example of profiting off of ownership alone as renting something out. In a society characterized by justice and reciprocity you acquired that personal product via some kind of labor.  So by selling that product in this context you are trading that product back to society for the labor value you put in to get it which you can now spend on something else.  Renting however implies a classbased distinction between owner and renter that requires a state apparatus to maintain.  Alot of this may seem counterintuitive at first.  I would highly recommend David Schweickarts After Capitalism for a very clear introduction to the ethical and philosophical justifications for thinking this way including rebuttals to the standard capitalist objections many of which are continually raised on this sub.  Unfortunately the best way to obtain it is to get a cheap used edition via Amazon but the first edition can be read here  Schweickart is especially good when it comes to answering the query why shouldnt capitalists profit from their capital contributions as well as their labor contributions?,CapitalismVSocialism,ddmby2x,1,t5_3cct3

I guess a banks risk falls into one of these categories mishedged risk unhedgable risk unknown risk or purposeful risk. I suppose only purposeful risk would be caused by the profit motive. Which type of risk is the most dangerous?gt Well the trouble here is that different types of risk are difficult to parceout and disentangle. But in principle it is doable with enough data availability. As for risks which are unknown these are particularly problematic because the fact that they are unknown typically means that they also go unmeasured and also the do not get priced into markets. But also there is something to be said for the behavioral economics idea of bounded rationality here. A lot of market risks are complex enough and fastevolving enough that its difficult for individuals in the market to accurately deal with them unless they hire a broker of some kind....which is a separate can of worms. This is actually an issue that prudential regulation aims to mitigate hence the name. It IS possible to migitate the bounded rationality problem by simplifying risks and transactions marketwide.

10837172,0,t1_ddxs00i,gt Im not really a libertarian socialism but Ive been learning about it and just want to give some thoughts.gt In an anarchosocialist society people would still have incentives to do useful work. Many people are really just interested in technologymath and would work making things like computers because they want to. Ive personally contributed very little to open source projects for no reason other than supporting them and I would contribute more if there werent people better than me already contributing. gt If progress is slower or we have to live with crappier technology but we live in a world where we dont need to put up safety nets to prevent suicides I would be fine with that.gt As to your unionized factory example I work in a unionized factory and there are actual people who work hard for exactly those reasons even with plenty of lazy workers some with higher seniority who get paid more. Some people take pride in their work ethic. I personally work harder sometimes because it makes the day go by faster. Sometimes just to test myself. gt In any case the kind of socialism I believe in is workers ownership over the means of production which wouldnt necessarily enforce equal pay for the sake of equality.gt gtI also do not understand how people who favor socialism also continue to use these capitalistic products. In order to use the products you have now you would have to pay for it. If people are so against capitalism why do they continue to purchase products that only help support and drive capitalism further? Im not sure of the varying levels of socialism but from the most popular socialist subreddit on reddit many people seem to think that capitalism is a disaster and they refer to Fidel Castro as a fellow comrade.gt Because they dont have a choice. If you were living under feudalism and you knew everything you know today you would look like a hypocrite. The way unjustified power works is that you can force it on people who dont believe in your right to hold it.gt I also wouldnt call capitalism a disaster. I just think there are much better systems.gt gtIn summary most of these points are based on the fact that without incentives there would be no innovation. People would not create new products and services just for the good of humanity and those that do such as Bill Gates who developed malarianets for Africa often already have plenty of money and are doing it as philanthropists. gt I just want to point out that a lot of times whats seperating the really wealthy is that they have the freedom to pursue what matters to them. Lots of people volunteer time and effort for the good of the world but they do not have the resources to devote more of this time and effort because they have jobs. gt gtMany products we use today came from the incentive of making money and that goes primarily against the foundation of socialism in which everybody no matter the skill level or experience gets a fair share even though they dont contribute much to the pot themselves.gt Again this isnt the type of socialism I subscribe to but people who believe in redistributive policy dont care about everyone getting their fair share. Its Keynesian economics. Dont quote me on this but I think the idea is to have the rich give up luxuries to provide the poor with necessities. This isnt for ethical reasons.

Im not much for the nonaggression principle and prefer to summarise my worldview with phrases like the principle of equal liberty which sounds more humane and less autistic than the axiomata coming out of deontological ancapism.I dont see ancap as the beacon on the hill. I see it as a pretty good solution to the problem of humans living virtuously and fulfillingly in each others company. I like to think of my position as being like that of Michael Huemer as stated in The Problem of Political Authority or in his debate with some Bleeding Heart Libertarians guys Quoth Michael...gt As I understand it the notion of political authority involves placing one agent above other agents. It involves postulating a special moral status for a particular agent the state such that a other agents have duties to obey the state in a wide range of circumstances in which they would not owe obedience to any other agent and b the state is entitled to do things that would be clearly wrong for any other agent. This violation of the ideal of moral equality calls for an explanation. What is so special about this one agent?gt No parallel question naturally arises about property rights. In claiming that there are property rights one is not claiming that there is any agent who is special in those ways. When I say that I own a car I am not placing myself above all other agents and it is not at all natural to respond Whats so special about you?gt Now you might say that I am claiming a special status namely that only I and no one else am entitled to decide how the car is used. That I may use coercion to prevent others from taking the car. That others must obey my wishes with regard to how the car is and isnt used. But this would be a pretty contrived way of arguing that I have a special moral status since other people have exactly parallel rights with respect to their own property.,CapitalismVSocialism,deb3rx9,1,t5_3cct3

That doesnt mean that WW caused by a massive migration crisis that leads to explosive political tension is an outcome that should be overlooked simply because well it wont completely destroy the species. gt I dont disagree with this. The state has a role to play here appropriately pricing a commons which the market is not appropriately pricingGood an area of common ground for what to do in the context of a capitalist economy. gt Im pretty sure economic elites allowed for the New Deal because they werent ideologuesNot ideologies but merely looking out for their own selfinterest. The elites had power. They wanted to retain that power and not risk a violent working class revolution. Thats why they allowed for the New Deal. The elites picked reform over revolution knowing it was in their best interests. gt Socialism was purely ideological The Soviet Union existed when the Great Depression in America occurred. A society that labelled itself Socialist already existed and its economy was fundamentally different from that of the United States. In that time socialism was seen to be more than just a theory by many in the working class. And the Socialist Party of America in the early th century had rather notable political support from the masses for a rd party. gt Additionally the lack of competition and real price signals means they unwisely spend that money so yeahKind of a moot point when there really is no alternative in a capitalist economy but to have a government provide certain services if you dont want the bottom  of society to violently revolt due to crushing economic conditions. You either have those services paid for by government with whatever theoretical misallocations or you dont have them at all in any form resembling universal access. gt classical liberal ancestors who unwittingly laid the groundwork for capitalism by realizing their political ideals into lawClassical Liberal theorists didnt establish capitalism. The British government established capitalism through land enclosures and currency devaluations. Classical Liberals simply made a political philosophy defining human rights and the human condition in a way that was compatible with the material conditions of a capitalist economy. gt Theres nothing special about your magical Fed that makes it effective and good where an alternative born voluntarily from the fertile land of the market couldnt do just as wellI dont see how its even possible to have a central bank created by market forces. And even if it was whats the point if it becomes a central bank in the end anyway? It would take the same form. What youre talking about largely existed during the Free Banking Era. And it never produced something like a central bank. And its worth pointing out that my words about the Fed are not borne out of moral allegiance but simply an objective analysis of what works and what doesnt based on the evidence. I dont especially love central banks because I dont love capitalism  Im a socialist. But in the context of a capitalist system a central bank works better than any alternative that has ever existed prior within a capitalist system. gt but I havent yet found a set of rules that cant be interpreted where even a small exception can blow up in size to this massive overregulatory bloated welfare stateWell I just go by the evidence on what has worked and what hasnt. Theres no end to slippery slope arguments which is why they tend to be a waste of time. Were better served by just examining the evidence. gt Weve tried not having a central bank and all things considered? We did pretty damn well. No it didnt turn out that well. gt Sure but none of the proconsumption and proenvironment policies at the Federal State County or Municipal levels of government have any effect as profound as the Feds target rate  which affects every holder of U.S. currency. Since U.S. currency is the worlds standard reserve currency and since its use is prolific worldwide i.e. beyond the reach of the above mentioned government policies I dont think its remotely unreasonable to suggest that itsYoud have to provide evidence to support this view on comparing effects on the environment. Speculation isnt good enough. gt People are financially penalized for consuming resources. The more they consume the more they spend. If theyre wealthy or government employees then they have the wherewithal but not infinite wherewithal to engage in profligate consumption  but thats the overwhelming minority of people and even then to assume all rich people are like that is a foolhardy assumption. My folks did pretty well for themselves they also never once bought a new car or probably even ever spent more than  upfront not including cost of ownership for any vehicle they owned. So yeah Id argue that your request for evidence in this case is again selfevident. People dont just throw things away after one use especially people who do not have the financial means to. Poorer people have to stretch out and maximize the utility of resources they gain control of and they get exceptionally good at this. Societal mechanisms like credit and debt prevent people from abjectly consuming wanton amounts of resources.Sorry but this does not remove the need for evidence. A lot of what people consider selfevident too often turns out to be completely false when the evidence comes out. gt Its selfevident. People dont consume just to consume  the only way they do that is if theyre enabled to consume by people who think making everything free would have no consequences. Everything isnt free and people are hesitant to part with their resources without assurances that theyre getting something of equal or greater value in exchange for them.If people didnt conserve their resources theyd be socialists. The fact that people do conserve them by imposing norms of ownership on them suggests that they arent  by nature. If they trust the people around them to uphold the commons socialism can work  but they dont at least not in modern societies comprising thousands or more people.What youre talking about is a far and away tangent from the topic I was questioning you about. You do in fact need evidence to support your original point  the idea that people would conserve more on their own and that this would overall be a greater benefit to the environment than Fed policies plus social democratic energy transformation initiatives. gt Yeah I disagree with that. Fracking has made more of a dent on curbing climate change than every wind farm and solar plant in the country and thats squarely the market at work  even factoring in coal regulations. Public investment in green energy means fuck all when green energy produces an order of magnitude less power than fossil fuel energy.We wouldnt need fracking if we invested sufficiently in green energy. The fact that America has not done so sufficiently up to its true capacity isnt cause for praising fracking over public investment in green energy. ,CapitalismVSocialism,deejgrt,1,t5_3cct3

It manifests itself differently depending on psychology but its the same motivation. Rightists tend to be high in conscientiousness see the Big Five which makes them more ruleoriented. For the ancap universalist motivations yield universal rules i.e. deontology  universalism i.e. something like NAP or whateverbasically here are the rules and if those rules make some people starve then too bad the rules are what make it fair. Leftists tend to be high in agreeableness which makes them more empathetic.

Since minimum wage in many countries is barely able to cover that as it is youll have get the insurance company to pay out the whole amount each month. Usually they do a percentage of your previous wage as an incentive but since your unemployment insurance payout will be less than the cost of livingminimum wage its existence is superfluous from the getgo. Even if they did do a full payout then as I said and you once against conveniently dont seem to read? a person making minimum wage is not likely to be attractive as a prospective employee for many otherwise that person wouldnt be earning minimum wage in the first place so the unemployment is likely to last longer than a person specialised in a rare and useful skill. ,CapitalismVSocialism,degs92n,1,t5_3cct3

That it feeds more people over time does not mean that it has increased efficiency it just means that it has increased productive capacity  which it does.  No one is denying capitalisms productive capacity.  Increased efficiency of allocation would be feeding more people with the same productive capacity.You seem to not know what the word efficiency means.  For example this report estimates a  increase in food waste over the last  years journals.plos.orgplosonearticle?id.journal.pone.   thats not increase efficiency.  Now are less people starving in the word?  Perhaps I dont have the answer off the top of my head but that doesnt mean weve gotten more efficient at allocating food.gt Capitalism provably allocates resources with increasing efficiency...Then prove it.gt Uh no the state cant just do it on its own without needing to make massive calculations or starve and oppress half your population... Not only is this like econ  shit but youd have to deny a century of observable Communist Party atrocities to pretend states can just successfully direct command economies at whim without massive distribution problems.I said absolutely nothing about the wellbeing of its population or successful directing of command economies.  I said if the state intends to enrich itself.  That this comes at a great cost to is not particularly surprising.  That is results in political suppression and enslaving subordination to state demands is to be expected.Youve not explained why it needs a computer to do this.

It amassed insane amounts of wealth in a handful of decades inevitably resulting in demonstrable decadence of the state apparatus through military and imperialist expansionism.gt If it somehow wasnt clear in my OP I was hoping to imply that Marxbot  would allow states to legetimize their authority by successfully allocating resources without needing to perform feats of oppression rivaling the Soviets.Why would a computer automatically do this?  A computer is a tool.  If your goal is to enrich the state then you will use the computer towards those ends and if anything the computer will maximize oppression even more if it models things correctly.

Well they would avoid paying corporate taxes but theyd still have to pay individual taxes. And if theyre disbursing money into somebodys pocket then thats income mate. And income is taxable mate. And if its not income then they cant disburse it as a corporate taxdeductible expense mate. So if they do declare capital gains then it must have come from the profit of the corporation mate. gt Return on capital is way up relative to return on labor   Thats not what your other chart showed It showed that the investment share i.e. the input part of the GDP has become a bigger portion not the output part of the GDP profit.

I dont see how a market socialism of any kind can involve a free market as it must necessarily prevent marketbased allocation of ownership of the MoP. A restricted market is not a free market by definition correct? gt All of which are allocated by the government not by capitalists or by a marketThats objectively incorrect capital markets markets for the selling of land labor markets financial markets etc... Of course markets are the primary means of allocating the factors of production in a capitalist economy. gt private property is a violation of the free market since the only way private property was able to displace individual and common property is by state violence. A free market can be created by violence in fact youre all but admitting that a system in which factors of production and not just commodities are allocated by markets can only be made possibly through state policies that end common use of land and other onceshared resources. How is your definition of a free market valid if it necessarily involve markets being restricted to a narrow domain of mostly only allocating finished goodsservices? Perhaps the usage of the word free is where the difference in interpretations lie. The common usage of the word free market implies markets that are unrestricted. Your usage seems to be one that means markets that come about without the imposition of state violence. Correct?If so then I think I basically understand your point of view in which case theres no real basis for a continued disagreement. gt but markets arent central to my ideas I just dont preclude their existenceMy view is that the need for markets must be transcended.

11326623,0,t1_dfftfoc,gt LTV says value is invariant in respect to labour time.No value does change as SNLT changes over time. gt If LVT is true business owner has nothing to worry about. Produced value is constant as long as number of workers and working hours are constant so rate of profit can also remain constant.Which never happens in a market system because producers are competing for market share at all times. They can only become more competitive in the longrun by increasing their labor productivity. And of course all the producers working to do this over time decreases the SNLT over time. These labor productivity gains occur as the ratio of constant capital MoP to variable capital Labor increases. This reduces the proportional amount of variable capital aka labor which is the only factor of production from which surplus value can be extracted. Thus the rate of return on ownership of the MoP decreases over the longterm as the ratio of constant capital to variable capital increases. gt I gave you a example that illustrate this. You presented your example in a very unclear way. gt Value of those wallpapers is clearly independent from labour spend to produce it and it doesnt depend on technology either.If those wallpapers are no longer commodities on the market of course it has no commodity value. You havent really disproved anything here. I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Law of Value actually claims and what Marx wrote about it.

By all accounts we are privileged as fuck and that further proves my point you can make  dollars an hour doing what some other bloke spends a week doing. Why squander a golden opportunity? Theres very few real excuses for being homeless or poor here. Thats largely a result of your own shortcomings and general lack of dedication.

I could show you evidence supporting my claim which you deem invalid then you will show some evidence which I will deem invalid and both of us gained nothing.But to prove my insanity I will present my evidence nevertheless.gt In fact ... the entire concept of a market is simply a way to conveniently abstract a system of independent players property owners wage earners landlords etc.Ohh yes I agree. Economics is all about human action and with praxeology we can get a grasp of how individual choices determine the course of the world. Have you read Human Action? Its difficult stuff only got through half of it yet but it wouldnt surprise me if you read it as part of your curriculum.gt The abstraction allows individual actors to be absolved of blame.You rightly claim the free market is sometimes used as a tool for collective judgement but its not if you follow the Austrian school of economics. There only individual actors exist and all collective phenomena are just a collection of individual choices. If the market does something bad then its really just individuals choosing to act in a bad manner. In principle we do agree on that I guess....gt It is an effective propaganda technique and one which I would encourage you to examine more closely.Collective judgement? Hell yes and indeed I should look more into it when I have the time.gt Why do you think the free market is the best way to allocate resources?Because profits. When I waste resources I get fewer profits or even a loss and lose to competition who wastes less. If I use resources productively I will get higher profits thus I will be able to gather even more resources.gt there is no evidence to suggest that a market free from the state would provide a good outcome.We have Somalia which despite its average IQ of  is quite a success story Still full of statist though.gt gt There is no doubt that Somalia remains extremely poor today. However as far as living standards can be assessed they appear to be improving since the collapse of Somalias national government. In fact standards are improving faster in Somalia than in most of subSaharan Africa.gt And we have high correlation between economic freedom and happiness Of course you may say that this would go down once we reach even more economic freedom but Id like to see some evidence for that.gt First because we have never had stateless capitalism.All the things anarchocapitalists advocate have individually succeeded at some point in the past or present like private justice as in medieval Ireland and Iceland and currently in international business or private security as in every mall ever etc. a talk for an overview of private law so it would be very surprising and counterintuitive if these individual successes would suddenly become a failure once we combine them into fullblown anarchocapitalism. gt Second because many of the things that which allow a society to prosper come from the state contrary to what you may believe.Like roads yes. I dont think some of the stuff the state does shouldnt exist. I just believe whatever the state does would be better served if there was competition between transportation education health law security etc. Just think about the mess of public infrastructure public schools singlepayer healthcare government justice system and police brutality.gt Your iphone for example was largely developed by the state. So were computers planes and nearly every other major piece of technology. Your capitalist innovation is actually state innovation. The most significant scientific research is often done in state institutions.So? Before the state ran research we had a lot of scientific process by private individuals as well. We had the light bulb the steam engine the plane the car the radio aspirin nylon etc. Only because large corporations can get free research nowadays that doesnt mean it would mean less progress without the state. It would just mean that the incentive to make profitable inventions would go up whereas nonprofitable inventions would go down.gt The Soviets were able to industrialize and make scientific strides in a far shorter period of time than any capitalist country on recordIt would be nice to have a source there. You shouldnt forget that the Soviet Union collapsed in a far shorter period of time than any capitalist country on record gt To claim that the current data proves that a free market would provide the best outcome is simply nonsense.Well if I look at this map  how capitalist a country isAnd then this map  starvationI see some strong indication that less capitalism clearly means more death. Also capitalism is lifting insane numbers of people out of extreme poverty each day  . If youd really wanted to help the most amount of people youd celebrate what capitalism has done to help the third world.gt Evidence that capitalism rewards the more intelligent? In my experience the opposite is true but I suppose any evidence which contradicts your claims can easily be dismissed as the product of state intervention. GDP and intelligence There is something measurable called general intelligence g that differences in g are strongly influenced by genetic factors ... and that g is an accurate predictor of success in lifegt Even though I am convinced that stateless capitalism if it ever exists will simply collapse immediatelyLets see how Liberland performs once the Croatian police stops arresting its citizens. The president is a fullblown ancap. According to Austrian school of economics it would prosper so we can just wait and see. If local libertarian experiments fail then libertarianism will never become big and scary.gt your fringe philosophy is a convenient tool that is often used by ruthless state capitalists government bad market good.Same holds for state communism but with a  death count probably more market bad government good.

Slavery and Colonialism may be dead and gone but the differences in wealth that it produced live on. For Europeans this legacy is especially pronounced since we actually still have a lot of infrastructure and physical wealth which is connected to the wealth generated by colonialism in one way or another. But the real question is what do we do about it now? A lot of the originally plundered resources have been consumed or soldon while the people involved are longgone. The city where I live is the center of a railsystem originally built using both local steel reserves and plundered african hardwood which has since been replaced meanwhile the forests where those hardwoods used to be were replaced with rubber plantations and the people forced to work those plantations instead of growing food crops. so lots of starvation happened. Then the rubber was sold on to germany and england to fuel their industrialization since it was way more than we could use domestically. Thats why we had the budget to build such a fancy rail system and such a fancy capital city. And then we also spent part of colonial tax revenue on building parts of the capital. And then we conscripted a bunch of them to fight amp die in the trenches of the western front. Which ultimately led to the Germans having to pay reparations to US but not to our coloniesAnd thats where my citys wealth came from.

People will follow leaders if they genuinely want to but if they dont want to there is nothing forcing them to do so. gt I find it interesting that they wouldnt ever get intimidatedTheres no mechanism through which someone could truly threaten another to force them into doing what they wanted. The only intimidating factor could be the informal social pressure involved with leaving your commune or splitting it. gt What is the cohesion method to keep these groups from dissolving during times of discourse? They dont have to remain together. They should be allowed to dissolve and split apart if they want to.

Socialism isnt intended to be a better way to produce the outcomes that capitalism produces today.  The intent was from the beginning to let capitalism build the things necessary for society then institute socialism to allow labor to enjoy it.  There are necessarily tradeoffs.  Socialism doesnt create high skill employment nor does it promote innovation though I would not expect innovation to stop.  Some people enjoy innovation but not nearly as many as enjoy money.

11698150,0,t1_dglwcnc,gt Money is not special enough to need a different term. There is nothing fundamentally different between the price of a good in dollars gold hours of labour or bushels of wheat.Money is very special.  Also gold is a form of money.  Im not sure wheat ever has been.  But good money has a few qualities which differentiate it from other commodities relatively low use value with a relatively high exchange value so a little is worth a lot and therefore it can operate as currency being physically carried. being uniform in its character so it can be divided and recombined being highly divisible in the first place having properties which make it difficult to fakeNow while those are all interesting and important aspects of which commodities make good money.  The more special thing about money is the characteristics it takes on because it is money.gt If one bushel of wheat costs one dollar then price of a bushel of wheat in dollars is one and price of a dollar in bushels of wheat is one.This is true but a bushel of wheat is not money therefore it cannot be exchanged universally.  So to say that price is not anything special is rather naive.  Price unlike other exchange values has no concrete character.  There is no penalty incurred if your desires change i.e. if you exchange a bushel of wheat and decide later you only want half because then you need to find someone who wants half a bushel of wheat.  Without money in order for an exchange to occur you either need the right proportions of particular usevalues or need to spend time converting them to use values you do wantneed.This would result in a very different society.gt This is a discussion on terms...Well Im not particularly interested in that discussion.  Call these things what you want.  Im more interested for example in the difference between exchange for a concrete use value a bushel of wheat vs. exchange for an abstract value some portion of money... I dont particularly care if you dont think those are worthy of two separate words or which words you choose for each.gt But you still value them on the same scale because you can choose between them.Again I agree that it is possible to value two things in the same sense which are otherwise not normally valued in the same sense.gt If they were not on the same value scale you wouldnt be able to choose between them.That they can be put on the same scale is not being disagreed with.  That there is only one scale is what is disagreed with.  Iron is likely of much higher exchange value than friendship generally while friendship is much higher than iron in terms of emotional value generally.gt So value youre talking about is just price exchangevalue?No.  Exchange values are however expressions of value in terms of usevalues.  The reason value without any qualifier is because of dual nature of commodities as usevalues and exchangevalues.An exchange value is the realization of one usevalue for another usevalue. cups of wheat flour  a usevalue eggs  another usevalueAs concrete measures of concrete goods both of those things expressed individually are only capable of telling the observer of their use which is inherent to what they are physically in this case both are sources of nutrients and calories and thus can be used as food.An exchange value is when two such usevalues are equalized in exchange cups of wheat flour   eggsThis for Marx however presents a peculiarity because these things are different qualitatively.  In the case of two things which can be used as food this may not seem so peculiar but every commodity has relative values to other commodities as well so the following may also be true cups of wheat flour   yard of linenSo an exchange value is the expression of one use value  cups of wheat flour in terms of another  yard of linen.  But if these two things cannot be used equally then how can they be made equal?What Marx argues is that there must then be a third form of value i.e. that society recognizes in each of them such that despite their vastly different uses one could be equal to some portion of another.This is value unqualified.  Or as Marx sometimes refers to it abstract value.gt And labour for some reason is the only thing that can increase price exchangevalue of a good?Its not clear what you mean by increasing price.  If you are considering price to be the same thing I consider an exchange value then an increased price can result from multiple factor but yes all related to labor.Lets sayX  YIf I increase the amount of labor required to produce X the price of X in terms of Y goes up.  If I increase the amount of labor required to produce Y the price of X in terms of Y goes down.  Likewise if I decrease the amount of labor required to produce X then the price of X in terms of Y goes down.  If I decrease the amount of labor required to produce Y then the price of X in terms of Y goes up.So an increase in price of X in terms of Y could constitute a decrease in the amount of of labor required to produce Y.  No increase in the amount of labor required on either side.gt Thats objectively untrue.I agree see above.gt Or is it a separate value?Exchangevalue is an expression of value.  So yes what affects value socially necessary labor time affects exchangevalue.  However its also possible that the value of both goods changes and therefore the exchangevalue remains the same.Returning to our previous example ifX  YThen we say that X takes twice as much SNLT to produce as Y.  But if some advancement halfs the labor required to produce Y while some other advancement halves the labor required to produce X then their exchange value in terms of one another will remain precisely the same despite both their values having gone down.Relative to some third commodity you may be able to determine that this actually happened or what happened.For example ifX  YX  ZThen Y  Z.If we say after some time that X  Y we do not know whether or not this relative change was a decrease in the value of X or an increase in the value of Y.  However if we know the value of Z has not changed and we find that X  Z then we know that the value of Y has increased as the value of X relative to Z has remained the same.gt Your socialist rhetoric is confusing because you use value in two different terms usevalue and exchangevalue but then you use VALUE without any qualifiers in the next sentence.Its not very confusing.  Admittedly I may not be the best at explaining it but the difference between the three can be understood generally pretty well by reading just the first few paragraphs of Das Kapital.gt If it is not one of the two then it is a third separate term.Correct it is a third separate term.gt Where does it come from?It comes from the antagonism between usevalue and exchangevalue.  To say that  cups of wheat flour   cups of wheat flour is simple... the are equal in every possible sense precisely the same substance precisely the same quantities and can serve precisely the same function.  To say however that  cups of wheat flour   eggs is less simple... now they may serve a similar function food but not precisely the same function I cant for example swap the eggs I use in my cake with more flour.  So these are obviously unequal in some sense.Yet they have been made equal in exchange.  How are they made equal?  What forces have determined that in exchange  cups of wheat flour will   eggs?  What governs such rates of exchange between commodities?Now you will say that nothing governs it except individual valuation.  That is Bob decided hed prefer  eggs and no longer wanted  cups of flour and Mel decided she wanted  cups of flour and no longer wanted her  eggs.  So that  cups of flour   eggs in exchange was a matter purely of the chance that Bob and Mel met offered what they no longer wanted for exchange and bargained to particular quantities.Marx says no.  That  cups of flour   eggs is determined by the fact that  cups of flour takes the same amount of socially necessary labor time as  eggs.  Admittedly this is determined in a very round about way  it is not as if Mel has in mind how much time it took her to tend teh chickens and harvest the eggs nor does Bob have in mind how long it took him to seed harvest and grind the wheat.gt I think that above link is correct and you actually think that THE SOCIETY values things but youre just scared to admit it to me or to yourself because it is such an absurd idea.I dont even know what that could mean the society valuing things.  Social relations determine value but to say that the society values things would seem to imply some sort of social consciousness which is not the case.  In fact that SNLT  value is very much dependent on the notion that society does not consciously value things.If society consciously valued things the closest I could think that to mean is that society determines some metric by which cost should be determined that is tied to some objective property  this would far more resemble socialism a system where value is abolished than it would capitalism.,CapitalismVSocialism,dgm05c8,1,t5_3cct3
