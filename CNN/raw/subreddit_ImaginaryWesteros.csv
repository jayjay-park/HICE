Honestly I feel this is something I see often in asoiaf art and fantasy art in general theres a tendency to make the female characters pretty or sexy even in scenes where sexiness was not the original focus.

One of the most memorable things to me about her description was her crooked teeth. I thought it was adorable how Jon finds her beautiful despite her quirky features.Jorah is so completely different too. The actor is so handsome!

10596797,0,t3_5rp0zc,I know this is a repost I deleted the original and wanted to test out a new formatEddard Stark has been King of The North since  AC the first since Torrhen Stark knelt to Aegon Targaryen. He married Lady Cersei Lannister  in Riverrun Capitol of the Riverland Kingdom. This was in the midst of the Sundering Rebellion after the Battle of Bloody Bells where King Eddard earned his namesake Red Wolf. He was born the second son of the late Lord Rickard Stark at Winterfell. His father brother Brandon Stark and sister Lyanna Stark died during the rebellion. Leaving only Eddard and his younger brother Benjen as the last Starks.Spending most of his youth in Winterfell he fostered in the Eyrie and taught by the late Lord Jon Aryyn along side Robert Baratheon heir to the Stormlands. When news arrived of his sisters kidnapping by the Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen along with the executions of his Father and Brother Eddard and Robert raised the banners in Rebellion. The Westerlands along with the Iron Born soon joined as Lord Hand Tywin Lannister had been executed as well and the now Lord Jaime Lannister joined in alliance with Lord Quellon Greyjoy.After the Battle of Bloody Bells Lord Stark stopped at Riverrun and met Lady Cersei as after her fathers death she fled to the home of her goodsister Lysa Tully now Lysa Lannister. It was there that he married her and she later birthed him twins Robert and Joanna Stark. After the Night of Fire and the restoration of the Seven Kings King Eddard Stark and Queen Cersei Stark proceeded to have five more children Myranda Stark Edwyle Stark Jonnel Stark Tya Stark and the youngest Brandon Stark.King Eddards reign has not been without challenges. Now a new kingdom the North had to set up infrastructure it hadnt required in for hundreds of years. New trade agreements were struck an east and west royal fleet put to sea and coastal settlements raised to ferment population growth needed to sustain the North. Much of it considered impossible without the close relationship between the North and the wealthy Westerlands. Because of these numerous projects much of the internal struggle has been muted. Northern resentment of the southern influence the presence of a Lannister Queen presented though an obstacle early on was mostly put to rest after the Iron Kinslaying War of AC. The only true challenge to the Starks right was the Boltons Treason. Evidence surfaced that Lord Roose Bolton conspired with several of his vassals to overthrow the Starks and by marrying his son Domeric Bolton to the eldest Stark daughter Joanna Stark seal his claim to the Winter Throne. Roose and his conspirators where captured tried and found guilty. The lesser vassals took the black while the former Lord was beheaded placed on a spike by the Queen herself where it still sits. Domeric was granted mercy allowed to take the name Dustin as Lady Barbarys heir through their relation. Her husband dying the year before from a hunting accident leaving them childless. The High Lordship of the Dreadfort was given to King Eddards brother Lord Benjen Stark and his new bride Lady Dacey Stark formally Dacey Mormont. The Dreadfort forever renamed the Direfort.King Eddard is universally loved among his people his judgments fair and his right to rule respected. Reflect perfectly in the words of the kingdom.
