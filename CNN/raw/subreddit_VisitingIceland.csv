There are signs that warn you about actual speed cameras they look like this and the signs that warn you about m before look like this Icelandic roads can be dangerous for reasons tourists might not realize at all which is why ideally we want people to keep the speed low. There might be gravel black ice unexpected sheep on the road and untrustworthy sides of road that might cause you trouble or to swerve in which case the lower your speed the better. Local drivers are aware of the dangers but yeah most drive  some  though which is not really cool our roads arent built for that speed.

But I have nothing bad to say about Kuku and Go campers. They offer slightly more basic campers but the last time I checked they were cheaper. So if its primarily about price those are great options.In addition to some of the excellent tips already posted here I would check out some of the campsites you plan on visiting.

The campgrounds were nice  some get VERY crowded with tour groups.  All had bathroom facilities picnic tables running water  most had laundry  some had wifi and basic kitchen areas.

I also see mentions of two other companies doing this Sjferir and Freyds but Im not sure if theyre still active.But it is certainly hard and expensive to get there and not so many people that actually go.

8113399,0,t3_4puhch,I actually met someone that reversed their schedule and slept from ap and did all the sights at night. He said it was great because he had most of the places to himself. You have virtually endless daylight so it works out. I went on a  hour hike at pm and it looked like late afternoon. At pm it looked like dusk. I think the timing depends on where you go. Some places will still be busy at noon or pm. For instance if you go to Skaftafell for hiking the trails didnt seem less busy in the afternoon vs the morning. However some waterfalls might be thinning out around then because the tour busses are moving on to the next place.,VisitingIceland,d4s0pj1,2,t5_2wgkr

It was absolutely breathtaking. Also whale watching was pretty underwhelming for us since we barely saw one whale and just a little bit of its backfin we did the small  person rib boat which was considerably more expensive but the boat is fucking awesome! It was worth it just for the boat ride alone.Glacier lagoon was pretty underwhelming as well there wasnt too much going on there but its still a must see in my opinion.

8553249,0,t3_4wv4ha,Im a fairly serious cyclist and I too considered biking in Iceland. It really depends on your goals and what you want to see. All of the rough nature is well outside the city so you need to make sure you pack enough supplies to get you by between towns. My two cents is that youre not going to get very far away from Reykjavik casually biking for a week or two and so you wont see a huge number of what Id consider astonishing views but it kinda depends on what you personally consider astonishing. If youre the type of folks who like to find a big crazy mountain and camp there to appreciate it for a few days then youll certainly find a couple of things but youll have to put in some effort to get there. Some questions to consider if you havent already Have you ever biked with the additional weight of camping gear? It can get quite exhausting even after a few miles. May also affect your balance. If youre serious about bikingcamping you should do a test run with your camping gear around your neighborhood if you havent. Include some hills cuz Iceland has plenty. Have you ever biked in the rain? Its quite possible youll get caught in some rain regardless of meticulous planning. Also make sure to bring a dry bag to protect any electronics. Rainwind leaves very few places to hide. Have you ever biked any sizeable distance before? I say this because you say you cant really climb on a bike and some serious pain will likely creep up on your unaccustomed bum even if you spread the distance over a leisurely pace.My vote is to drive if you can afford it. You can be leisurely and see a lot more. As a cyclist I can totally dig the whole being more connected to nature while on a bike thing but I wouldnt do it in Iceland unless going all in so to speak. Sorry if Ive misunderstood any of the stuff you said just my two cents. Whatever you guys end up doing good luck!,VisitingIceland,d6aqac8,1,t5_2wgkr
