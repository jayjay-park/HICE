1344685,0,t1_cikvfaf,There isnt really any talking except for like  lines but theyre sort of spoken in theme. Although the music in it does vary and some of the songs are quite metaly such as when pickles sings mostly or when its the revengencers parts but it does seem to try and put lyrics on the screen sometimes. Ive also heard that it is subtitled well if you can find them.I love it because i love the music in it so Im slightly biased as harmony and melodic stuff appeals to me.,Metalocalypse,cikw5i0,1,t5_2rboq

6873725,0,t1_d0vfpbz,I was just thinking he could probably tell the story through the music like he did with galaktikon and  doomstar requiem just using different names and such. Would probably be the closest thing to closure we could get.,Metalocalypse,d0vg6t6,2,t5_2rboq

8095066,0,t3_4pz0nt,Honestly at this point Im more excited for Galaktikon II. I love the first album to death and now Galaktikon II is basically an outlet for Brendons anger towards AS fucking us over.I think it would be hilarious if there was actually a universe crossover between Metalocalypse and Galaktikon where the Doomstar is actually the showdown between Beastblade and Triton and the Metalocalypse ends up being Triton arriving on Earth to search for the most metal band ever to help him save the universe.,Metalocalypse,d4pyifk,2,t5_2rboq

9000262,0,t3_53gp87,All of the versions your heat on the show are essentially preproduction demos. Some songs arent finished and the production is pretty rough compared to their album counterparts. I cant say for sure but Id venture to geuss that none of the demos are speeded up but perhaps a different tempo since a lot can change once you enter the recording studio.  BPM can make a huge difference especially for music this complex and fast.,Metalocalypse,d7tox9m,4,t5_2rboq

As far as my research has led me Galakticon is the unofficial band name for DethKlok and therefore is the continuation. ,Metalocalypse,dftmjry,2,t5_2rboq
