126582,0,t1_cesu6kb,Although that is not always the cause of the fall of a democracy some political scholars including one of U.S. founding fathers thought this is an inevitable end of any democracy if something else does not kill it first. The notion is that the moment politicians realize that they can get votes by redistributing wealth and the moment the voters realize that they can vote for their own free lunch the downward spiral begins. Those who work are discouraged because they can get all they need for free and eventually the state runs out of other peoples money.As an example many would credit the fall of Roman Empire to the fiscal insolvency caused in large part by trying to appease the citizens that did not work but demanded bread and games.,NeutralPolitics,cesugmy,9,t5_2tk0i

254958,0,t1_cf758jv,I cant tell if youve understood my point. Of course the mail server needs to know the recipient of the email to deliver it. The server also needs to know the contents of the email to deliver it unlike old fashioned mail. The courts are forcing an envelope analogy that doesnt exist in email.You seem to be suggesting that we should presume a lack of privacy that because in one domain there is a clear dividing line between public and private data we should treat all communication as though it were a mailed envelope. However there is no such distinction. If we believe on principle that the recipient identity has no protection then there is no limiting principle other than an analogy to mail to protect the so called content either. I dont believe that quaint analogy is a solid basis for legal theory... and I dont mean to sound condescending by saying so if I am. I believe that there never was an analogy to mail for telephone calls or email and that the government has no business with any of that information without a warrant. In all cases the metadata and data were both communicated in exactly the same way to the third party and deserve the same legal protection. Edit A friend brought up an interesting argument. Because reasonable expectation of privacy is subjective then the mail analogy may have legal weight if most people believe in it regardless of whether it holds in reality.

571849,0,t1_cg58x7k,I can see your point and I hate to use the slippery slope argument overused on Reddit IMO but where do we draw the line? Who decides whats worth infanticide? Sure the US can legalize child euthanasia on a national or state level but whats to stop an unethical doctor from signing off on a case that doesnt meet arbitrary criteria? Whats to stop a parent from deciding they dont want to bother with their kid anymore because theyre too much work to take care of? Whats to stop a US state or even other country from using one legalization as precedent for legalizing or even mandating the euthanization of for example kids or adults with Down Syndrome or any number of disabilities? Making a moral judgment on who should be allowed to live and who shouldnt is abhorrent to many in modern Western society but at the same time making it legal to do so is bound to normalize this idea.And I disagree with your judgment that chronic pain is somehow worse than blindness or deafness. This is a symptom that many children and adults deal with everyday and while certainly a cause of suffering is to a certain extent manageable just as the other two are. On malformations I find it difficult to believe that a parent would rather directly kill their child than allow it to live as long as possible not to mention that doctors can be wrong about life expectancy. On the last point I think that falls under abortion rather than euthanasia which AFAIK is justified when it threatens the life of the mother.While were getting better at meeting the needs of disabled individuals theres still a long way to go in terms of access treatment and technologies. Surely its better to focus on helping people function in society than telling them they dont deserve to exist. I just think euthanizing children outright is very much in line with the quick and easy fix idea but not so much in line with the freedom and opportunity ideals.,NeutralPolitics,cg59vob,1,t5_2tk0i

The man is not dead.By the way X very much affected Y...to use your example.While there are a multitude of reasons why his support of bigotry clashed with his position at Mozilla Including the loss of partnerships with other tech business the inability to present a clear concise business plan to media outlets due to this firestorm the loss of confidence in Mozillas brand name in a highly highly competitive market the main one that sticks to my mind is thisTech companies like Mozilla live or die based upon the human capitol they are able to attract.  Finding gifted and envelope pushing tech employees is difficult.  Thats one of the reason the tech center not only pays so well they also offer perks for employment that are unheard of in ANY industry.Mozilla competes with Facebook Google Apple and Microsoft just to name a few to gain skilled workers from a relatively small pool of candidates.  Candidates that are usually young sometimes gay and almost always socially liberal.Do you not think that it hurts Mozillas ability to hire the best employees when in a job interview they are forced to say We know what you have heard in the news but we swear Brendan Eich wont treat you like a fag.  He only does that in his personal life.  At work hes all business!  Thats a hurdle that other companies like Microsoft dont have to overcome.  Eichs presence as leader of the company presented an extra hurdle the company had to overcome.  A lot of people work at certain tech companies because of their reputation because of the esteem associated with the job.  Thats part of the reason people work at the White House rather than make  times as much in the private sector.

706691,0,t3_226he9,As a gay man who was unable to marry my partner of  years until recently in part thanks to Eichs donation let me say this.I have learned to be tolerant of people who believe samesex marriage is immoral mainly because I realized that the belief alone causes me no significant physical or economic harm.  Had Brendan Eich simply had a moral objection to samesex marriage but left me free to make the decision myself as to whether samesex marriage is morally acceptable or not and get married accordingly then I would have no problem with his leadership of Mozilla.Brendan Eich went beyond simply deciding to believe for himself that samesex marriage is immoral.  He threw his support behind a movement which sought out to use the power of government to deny other people their right to decide for themselves whether samesex marriage is immoral and engage in the free expression of civil marriage if they choose to.  That is unacceptable to me.  Tolerating that kind of position would cause me and my family real financial harm in addition to harmful legal liabilities.In that context unless Mozilla condones the use of government force to deny individuals freedom of certain expressions or equal treatment under the law Brendan Eich should have never been offered the position of CEO in the first place.  After being given the job it was Brendan Eichs decision as to whether he would continue to support government oppression of LGBT people or completely renounce it.  Given that we heard no such renouncement I can only assume he continues to believe that government should step in and lay the hammer down on LGBT couples and that is unacceptable.,NeutralPolitics,cgklrb3,1,t5_2tk0i

That is an obscene amount of money. Shouldnt we ban that as a misallocation of tax dollars which is transparent propaganda regardless of whether you like ACA or not?Now Im not actually putting this forward as an argument but I should make a new thread and do the homework to find studies and multiple sources and all that. I think its worthy I just have four children QED.

Horrible sentence sorry.My real point is that to ask why something should not be banned is to take the position that the government should have few or no limits on its power and thus be able to ban that thing regardless of what that may be. Thats scary to me.TLDR  If the government should be able to make editorial decisions on ad spending its fair to think of what happens when your guy isnt in office.Self edit I know that we are talking about an industry which is already very highly regulated.

806072,0,t3_23d11c,I think that this is certainly not good news but I dont think it really changes the debate much. And it always seems that these attempts to uncover voter fraud leave out the most likely canidate  the noncitizen voter.I explain it at length hereBut the main gist isWhat type of voter fraud does the system miss? It is the noncitizen voter that is missed. The system does not ever verify citizenship. It does at times cross reference lists of people who have registered with lists of immigrants who have an ID that states NonCitizen or can otherwise be documented in the legal immigration system as overstaying the legal terms of residence. But this form of verifying is not the same as verifying citizenship. It only catches people who are fully aware of their presence in the system and does not even look for those who have never been in the system.For examplegtThe SAVE database was designed to verify immigration status in order to determine eligibility for various public benefits. It does not provide a list of citizens or noncitizens. Rather it compiles over  million records from at least twelve different databases about individuals who have interacted with the U.S. immigration system such as noncitizens placed in removal proceedings people with temporary visas lawful permanent residents naturalized citizens and individuals born abroad who obtained certificates of citizenship by proving that they derived U.S. citizenship from their parents.and alsoTennessee and Georgia do crosscheck with the DMV the rest of the country just requires you swear under threat of perjury that you are a citizen See link above.So what happens if a person is registered to vote and doesnt have a drivers licence that states noncitizen? The link isnt clear but it seems to insinuate that it isnt cross checked to determine who doesnt have an ID just who has an ID that states NonCitizen. Seems to me that person would know their ID says that and be much less likely to try and vote. A person who has no ID but registers to vote doesnt seem to get caught by the system in place.gtSupreme Court says states may not add citizenship proof for voter registrationThe entire point of an ID system is to verify who the person is that is voting but more importantly to verify the eligibility of the voter. How can that possibly be done without verifying the citizenship in a system that only allows citizens to vote?It is also important to recognize when touting the numbers what they are actually catching and what they are not catching. And no one really seems to report on this aspect of government in general. Instead the majoprity of reporters run with They say fraud doesnt exist so how could it?Illegal Immigrants number . million in the US that the government acknowledges. I suppose it could be less but suspect it is probably much more. This is a sizable portion of society that has already broken our federal laws has a vested interest in the outcome of elections has a specific belief that they should have a right to be treated as American citizens and really has no reason to fear getting caught. In interactions with our society Here in CA is my experience when an illegal immigrant without a licence is caught driving  the policeman must release that person by law. With Sanctuary city laws and federal laws prohibiting a request for proof of citizenship the current system is not designed to catch noncitizens  so how could it catch them? How could we have those numbers represented? How can that figure be relevant beyond confirming the system works if a person is somehow labeled as a noncitizen by the system?,NeutralPolitics,cgvwkgf,-1,t5_2tk0i

1157223,0,t1_chzls6g,gtWhy should money continue to influence politics in the way it does?Because campaigning is expensive. Elections are expensive. So I guess the real question is how can we make elections less expensive? Require media to allow equal airtime? st Amendmentth Amendment problem but you could probably get around it. Pay for candidates to drive around stumping with public funds? Publicly pay for their staff? What about incumbents that fly cross country? Should the government being paying fort hat as well. Should we force airlines to provide free transportation? Now what if EVERY SINGLE PESON decides to run for office? This is going to get real expensive real quick for taxpayers. Plus what if you dont support a candidate? Do you want your tax dollars going to support their campaign?I work for a US Representative in Washington DC. They are forced to spend most of their time fundraising because it is so expensive. I would actually argue that we need less limits on campaign donations. That way a candidate can pick up the phone one time each years and say as an example since they are well known Hey Mr. Koch I need  million or Hey Mr. Soros I need  million and then get back to work. Problem solved. That would make things so much easier. That takes  minutes.Limiting issue spending by wealthy individuals make sense in our heads because we feel like we have no power. You do. Its called voting. the Kochs and Soroses of this world only get one vote.As for banning money  again a tool  in politics? That sets a dangerous precedent because political speech even controversial is always meant to be protected. What if one day democrats decide to ban cars from driving on election day? Now rural people cant get to the polls. Are what if republicans decide to make public transportation not run on election day because its a holiday now? Do those scenarios sound unconstitutional? Sure but the argument is there that it isnt and lawyers would have a field day. Case law is written in an abstract way so it applies to multiple facts. Citizens United is a case that could be used to strike down these scenarios.,NeutralPolitics,chzsz7t,1,t5_2tk0i

1257867,0,t1_cib0hbb,What can someone do with a million dollars a year? Well they can invest donate maybe start their only little company.If Richard Branson didnt have so much money to use Virgin Galactic wont exist. If this maximum salary also exists for selling businesses then Elon Musk couldnt have made SpaceX SolarCity or Tesla Motors. Companies like Facebook and Google are a result of people giving large sums of their money to support them while they were still small start ups. If they didnt have this money then Google and Facebook might not exist.Sure nobody NEEDS  million a year but some people deserve that much and a hell of a lot more. If a person found the cure to HIV or Breast Cancer or whatnot they can save millions of lives. They deserve more than a million dollars a year and if they have a good business plan they can easily make this reality! Now if they had a maximum incomethey make about k a year why in the world would they sell this magical pill that cures HIV or Breast Cancer?Maybe theyre just good people but tons of people most people even would want something out of it. If it costs  to make a pill you cant just give it out for free can you? You wouldnt be able to sell more than  if we assume you need  to live off. There is no economic incentive to sell this pill because he cant make anymore money. How about someone who has a great idea a cell phone that never needs to be recharged. But this someone already reached the k and so he has no economic incentive to sell this phone.By limiting the amount of money someone can earn will hinder technological development due to smaller economic incentive. Moreover whos to say that somebody doesnt need  million dollars a year? Why in the world is that too much and who are you to say that it is too much? What is over consumption? What if I want a meal made by a first class chef three times a day? I might need a salary of  million to make this possible. Sure I dont need it but you dont NEED the computer youre typing on. You dont need that cell phone you have. You dont need cable television or streaming servicesyou dont NEED those nice shoes or that nice top. You dont need a book... hell you dont need a bedjust sleep on your mattress. You dont NEED spoon forks knives etc. just eat with your hands! Why can a governmentorganization limit the amount of money I earn? That doesnt seem fair does itand how does it help? If we have a salary limit Apple and Exxon Mobil will still be bringing in  billion each quarter. They cant pay their employees or executives anymore so it just starts piling up. If the government takes it whos to say they wont spend it on something trivial or unnecessary or something downright idiotic?  You and I both know that there are some financial loop holes that companies like Apple use to pay lower taxes or whatever. Whos to say that the rich wont find more loop holes and are bringing in billions every year but the poor now have this salary limit. How does that help? If anything it makes the divide even bigger!I personally disagree with maximum income but this is a controversial topic that needs debating.

1775514,0,t1_ck2v0xm,gt the entire premise of OPs question is based entirely on the idea that whites and minorities have different concerns. Republicans are not concerned about their concerns and that is why minorities dont like Repbulicans. Since youre arguing with me instead of OP it seems you accept this in some way. OP posted about the demographic shift without going into the reasons.  The demographic shift is a matter of accepted statistical knowledge at this point so I found the comments to be more interesting hence why Im arguing with you  youre interesting.I think you hit the nail on the head heregt Republicans are not concerned about their concerns and that is why minorities dont like Repbulicans.Im trying to argue that this is a bad electoral strategy in the medium and long term not so much the appeal to white males part its a good strategy to appeal to any large group but the part about doing nothing to appeal to any other group when the one group theyre courting is shrinking relative to the population and all others are growing.Though I think all the sound and fury about this is really the Republican Party in the process of coming to grips with the fact that conservatism as we know it is pretty much over on the national level.  Fiscal issues were always red herrings for the simple reason that the only effective difference between the parties on fiscal issues they only exist because the government has to spend money in order to do anything interesting the same as any other entity.  Put another way nobody runs on a platform of raising taxes and setting the money on fire.  Additionally very few people actually care directly about fiscal issues directly people are more concerned with as you put itgt We elect people to do stuff.We differ on what we think our elected representatives should be doing which is the domain of social issues.  The public took a hard left turn on social issues over the past decade or so for reasons I cant guess at but because people ultimately vote on social issues the Republican Party lost out and now has to come to grips with that and rebuild.  Politics moves slowly but it will happen or theyll cease to be relevant so it will probably happen.  If nothing else it should be entertaining to watch as they need an open ideological space to slide into you cant win elections without differentiating yourself from the competition which is also partly why their message seems so disjointed lately and the most likely one is somewhat to the left of the current Democratic Party it was mentioned elsewhere in the thread as a fusion of socialism and libertarianism.One final pointgt The stuff that whites care most about and minorities care most about happen to generally be different things.You keep iterating on this as though issues important to whites are exclusive of issues important to anyone else.  I disagree and I introduce the modern Democratic Party as evidence which seems to be holding a diverse coalition together.  Thus logically speaking it is entirely possible for a political party to address issues important to disparate ethnic groups.Basically it doesnt bother me if I vote for a candidate and once elected they work to the advancement of a group with which Im not affiliated.  Im not the only voter and whatever groups Im a member of are not any more important than the ones Im not so it would be pretty arrogant of me to change parties because the one I was supporting was doing something to help another group.

Romney Im glad that you recognize that alQaida is a threat because a few months ago when you were asked whats the biggest geopolitical threat facing America you said Russia not alQaida. You said Russia ... the s theyre now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know the Cold Wars been over for  yearsThis was the presidents confident assertion as of now and for the foreseeable future   will it be alQuaida or the Russian Menace that is in the minds of American voters?In fact with ISISs emergence in Iraq a situation that the GOP can also seize on in a continued criticism of ObamaThe Dems pressure for an early pullout theres really not much media presence to alQuaida on that front either.By the way Romneys remarks on Russia being our number . geopolitical foe were inspired by this exchangegtOn all these issues but particularly missile defense this this can be solved but its important for him to give me spacegtYeah I understandgtThis is my last election.

These things should the conflicts overseas that the US is  called to and is expected to be a part of in ending worsen   should that happen these things with this kind of framing will be a very large part of the offensive on Hillary as a competent president.Even this old chestnut long a favorite  I mean at least for me I guess might get brought back upHoweverWhat about jobs?What about immigration?What about gun laws?What about gay marriage equality?What about the financial services sector?What about student debt?What about the middle class?What about taxes?And what about jobs and immigration?These matter too and wont stop mattering and a warweary frustrated American public might just say Gah fuck it lets keep out and simply say We want a competent managerial style president who can do domestically all those things Obama didnt do well enough like we wantwill do the opposite as we desiredA Truman is pretty great.So is an Eisenhower.But people pretty much want a Bill Clinton or a Reagan every time and with as little foreign adventuring as possible and lots of growth and success and optimism about the future.Will Hillary be able to deliver what Bill could?Or is she just as much Obamas Secretary of State as ever?Itll be the interplay of characterizing her foreign policy with the American electorates expectations I believe that will determine how well Hillary is played against by the GOP.Its her race to lose essentially and the GOP is in a somewhat enviable position insofar as maybe picking up a majority and having their work neatly cut out for them in .The picture of preservation is a little messier on the Dems side.,NeutralPolitics,ck47y39,29,t5_2tk0i

2074743,0,t3_2il40r,The Atlantic had a pretty decent article a while back explaining why the current CEO pay is so high. Basically the argument is that CEOs lead up increasingly global companies that require a more refined set of skills than any time in the past  years. Because so few people have the combination of skills that major companies are looking for and because those companies are so massive the competition for that talent pool is fierce. There is another dynamic at play too that most people arent aware of. Back in the s the IRS made a major tax policy change regarding how income given to CEOs was taxed. Prior to a change in section m of the Internal Revenue Code CEO salary was deductible for a company. However once this rule was changed in  it was made so that any salary above  million was no longer a deductible expense for the company.  Michael Jensen and Kevin Murphy theorized that this made it very difficult for companies to reward CEO performance and use salary incentives to lure good CEOs. Almost immediately after this tax change CEOs started being compensated in nonmonetary ways particularly in the form of stock which would not be subject to the same IRS rule change. Another difference between stock and salary is that stock is a highly volatile asset whereas salary is stable and thus of a predictable value. Because stock could conceivably be worth little or nothing some time after a CEO left often through no fault of the CEO this meant that stock came with a risk premium To compensate for this the company would offer more stock to account for the difference.The other thing about stock is that it is a comparatively painless way for a company to reward a CEO. It is easier on the balance sheet to offer  million in equity than it is to offer  million in cash and in theory it provides an extra incentive for the CEO to perform since good performance should translate into higher stock prices benefiting the CEO the company and shareholders. Since it was a low cost way to offer a CEO compensation companies began to compete in the arena of pay by offering more and more stock in a way that they wouldnt necessarily offer salaries. In a sense the company was playing with Other Peoples Money namely the shareholders. Thus the idea of offering  million in stock compensation became a more feasible prospect than offering a  million salary. In many cases we see CEOs get exorbitant pay because they have to be lured away from another job. To account for the oppotunity cost of losing said job they naturally have to be provided a financial incentive to offset that cost. There was a big lawsuit between Disney and Michael Ovitz on this very issue. Ovitz was a very successful talent agent that had founded the Creative Artists Agency CAA where he was making boatloads of money. Eisner wanted to bring him over as an executive to the company. In contract negotiations he was essentially offered  million in stock plus  million in salary with almost no strings attached because there was no other way to lure him away from his lucrative position at CAA.  years into his contract it was found that he was entirely unfit for the job so Disney fired him. The shareholders sued to get the money back but lost essentially because the court found that the contract was reasonable given that it was necessary to entice Ovitz to come to Disney in the first place and given that the stock offerings were meant to entice him to come to Disney not as a regular form of payment.Now there are a lot of reasons to be critical of these trends. For one thing there is some evidence that CEO pay is not linked to performance There is the intuitive sense that the compensation is wildly disproportionate to the actual role of the CEO. Also there is the supposed moral hazard of CEOs engaging in an internal corporate raid to temporarily increase quarterly revenue at the expense of the long term health of the company though this last bit has been counteracted in recent years by more thoughtful contracts that keep shares from vesting until years after a CEO retires or if certain performance goals are not met as we saw recently with Jamie Diamond CEO of JPMorgan Chase So to answer the question I do not necessarily think this is a bubble primed to pop. I think CEO pay reflects market conditions and right now market conditions favor high pay. As long as we have a global economy with a few massive global corporations that are very demanding and as long as laws do not demand otherwise I think we can expect CEO pay to remain very high through the foreseeable future. ,NeutralPolitics,cl3jmv1,3,t5_2tk0i

2134476,0,t3_2jf5mo,I completely agree with you. Its despairing to watch problems become a scorched earth kind of topic where you cant even begin to discuss it without the entire thing turning into a screaming match before youve started.I think the origin of this problem is the idea that anyone who suggests a discussion or an alternative point of view is someone who is hostile. I.e. it becomes an usvsthem situation.In your example that would mean that anyone wanting to broach this topic must be some sort of apologist for child abuse which means theyre someone who must be attacked.So if thats the case then the only approach to this that I can see working is to build up trust as much as possible with the audience youre trying to talk to so that they cant as easily play the usvsthem card.This can be done by deliberately using voices that the audience already trusts to make the argument rather than yourself.For example when prominent sportsmen i.e. representatives of masculinity started to openly defend gay people thats when we started to see homophobia reduce significantly. Because the message was being carried by people like us rather than people like them.,NeutralPolitics,clb506z,2,t5_2tk0i

3327526,0,t3_2y9ao8,Lets break this question down into its logical propositions.  People elect candidates they believe to be confident.  The belief in confidence is informed by physical appearances.  The less competent a person is the more confident they often feel.  Conclusion Therefore voters are likely to elect incompetent people.  So the question is is this a logically valid conclusion? I think it is not. The first and most obviously problematic part of this argument is that of premise  and premise . In premise  we have established that people estimate confidence based on appearances. In premise  we have establish that less confident people often feel more confident than they are. However we have not established that a person that feels more confident must therefore appear more confident and thus we cannot know that voters would elect such a person. Therefore we have not made a fully valid argument. There is also the reality that none of these statements are actually deductive propositions because the actual evidence in this case is actually inductive in nature. At best we could create a statistical syllogism because it is not the case that all people fall prey to the DunningKruger effect nor is it the case that all people judge candidates based on appearance.

Usually when that happens they fail to mention that by law anyone working in the radio industry in the state of New York has to belong to the radio unionThe way the NY laws are structured is that industries can be unionized or not and the radio industry is unionized. There are also states that allow you to not be a member of the union but you have to still pay partial union dues So called Fair Share dues I do not know if NY is one of these states. The Argument behind the Fair Share fees are that since the union negotiates on behalf of all the employees the nonunion members still get a benefit. Though as pointed out elsewhere in the thread since the union gets to decide if it is going to file a grievance and the fact that they are much less likely to go to battle on behalf of a nonmember many workers choose to become members rather than pay a partial membership dues for minimal protection,NeutralPolitics,cpdytqz,7,t5_2tk0i

3474408,0,t1_cpni3cl,gt This notion ... that realworld application of capitalist economics doesnt prioritize some interests above others is absolute nonsense. Thats not at all what I said. Please read more carefully. The point I made which I backed with a peerreviewed research study is that economic consensuses exist and are based on data. This counters your idea that what is economically logical changes based on the perspective of the individual. Your assumption may be true in the absence of data but data can nonetheless answer the kinds of question OP is asking. Individuals have their own financial interests of course but asking the kinds of questions OP is asking can help usas a societyto make better economic decisions. After all Republicans and Democrats agree more with each other than they do with economists Why do you think that is? Because voters are going with their intuition rather than what the evidence says which is what economists do. Democracy functions better when the public is well informed. Kudos to OP for asking the right questions. Shame on you for derailing the conversation. gtI feel I made my point clearly in my closing.

US in .Whats interesting that children born to US parents in the zone !!!! were essentially stripped of citizenship.  The haste to prevent a flood of our little brown brothers from arriving at the US border and immigrating caused a very ill thought law to be passed.  So children born to US parents were stripped of citizenship by accident.  They actually had citizenship before via Naturalization Act  without question.  So congress passed another law in  and gave retroactive citizenship back to them.  It was that weird situation where people where actually actively stripped of citizenship who had American parents that makes the canal zone laws more interesting.

3476321,0,t1_cpof4ox,Is survival a right? Do nonsentient beings have rights? Weve chosen to make it illegal to intentionally harm them in the West but do animals inherently have rights?The fact is definitionally rights have to be created and enforced by society. Without a government of some type the term is meaningless. My point is that the natural rights such as life and liberty and derived from that the fruits of your labor commonly called property dont require action on the part of society for you to use them. Civil rights like voting healthcare shelter basic subsistence income are privileges afforded to us because we have a liberal in the original sense of the word and prosperous society. You can call them rights what will happen when there isnt enough money to pay for all of them? Was there a right to modern healthcare in the s? Then if so every government on earth was a human rights abuser and actually they usually were by modern standards but not for that reason. No they are privileges. Calling them rights implies that they are not something we need to work for but rather something we are entitled to as humans. As both of us have pointed out there is certainly nothing inherent in human nature that guarantees these rights outside of society.Just so theres no confusion the definition of rights from Google is a moral or legal entitlement to have or obtain something or to act in a certain way.However I think you can honestly say that from the first formation of society mankind had the potential to exercise their rights to life and liberty. They may not have been able to as the social order may have coerced them into certain actions to try and ensure the survival of society. But there was no way they could have the right to the internet or the right to healthcare. ,NeutralPolitics,cpoiy7l,1,t5_2tk0i

Today a police officer can affect a search after simply smelling the pot. If the officer finds any they can arrest the driver. Now this is technically an arrest for possession not DUI but given that the two notions will likely be strongly correlated the search and arrest in theory at least has the intended deterrent effect.There would need to be time place and manner restrictions on smoking weed i.e. no weed in the car at all for police officers to exert similar authority under the counterfactual where its legal.

5424601,0,t1_cw4yd73,Actually I think its great that you are voicing objections to something that sounds nice but hasnt been proven to work.  Whether or not you yourself believe in those objections is not important answering them is.There are smallscale studies that have tested the consequences of guaranteed basic income.  The most famous is MINCOME conducted in a Canadian town in the s for five years.  The results on whether it dampened or stimulated the labor force were mixed though all studies agreed that the measures that showed whether people thrive went up.Because of the renewed interest in guaranteed basic income there are a bunch of smallscale experiments under way.  The one in India is a randomized trial with multiple villages that involves giving money to all the residents in a village.  Their control is food subsidies.  The one in Denmark does not involve an entire city but randomly selects people who are currently receiving government subsidies and giving them guaranteed minimum income to see what happens.There are quite a few reasonable objections to guaranteed basic income. What effect has it on labor market?  What effect has it on inflation?  Would a significant proportion of the population spend that money on booze and drugs gamble it away?  Wouldnt a more targeted subsidy work better?  How would it work in a place like southern California where a substantial proportion of the population are not permanent residents?  And always How to fund such a program and what would we need to defund in return?For some of those questions we may speculate based on what we already know about subsidy programs.  But to really have answers we need more experiments to see what really happens.  Thats why I am glad of the renewed interest in guaranteed minimum income because it means such experiments get funded and conducted.  ,NeutralPolitics,cw51rxo,2,t5_2tk0i

Have a lower minimum wage for domestic corporations.This could incentivize companies to keep jobs in the country as well as reduce capital flight.

Whether you agree or disagree with Mills opinions his ideas are still very much alive in the political debates of any Western country and he argues them in a comprehensible and easy to read manner.  In that same vein Isaiah Berlins essay Two Concepts of Liberty is both interesting and thoughtprovoking.If youre interested in the history of the issues of politics that we still struggle with today basic stuff like the role of the state the individuals place in society concepts of freedom and democracy I would recommend reading Platos The Republic Hobbes Leviathan though it looks daunting in size you can skip quite a bit of it without losing the most important points Lockes Two Treatises of Government and Rousseaus The Social Contract.  Alongside Mill this should give you a basic overview of the development of the central ideas of modern politics though Ive obviously omitted a lot of important authors here like Kant Hegel Marx and Burke all of whom can be argued to have played an integral part in that same development.Getting into the th century you could check out Carl Schmitts The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy to understand a modern intellectual rationale for authoritarian government  the book The Concept of the Political is also relevant here.  Reading this book after Mills On Liberty can have great learning value as their ideas are quite opposed but in an intellectually honest way that forces you to think about the two positions.  Schmitt has been considered the crown jurist of the Third Reich but he also inspired central neoconservative ideologues in the US all the way up to the latest Bush era.If we come even closer to contemporary politics we have Jrgen Habermas and John Rawls both of whose influence on politics during the last  years has been remarkable though the influence is not very well advertised outside academic circles.Theres clearly tons of other stuff to read and just getting through what Ive listed here should take about half a batchelors degree worth of time.  It would probably be smart to get at least one comprehensive overview book to understand all the original thinkers in the context of their times.

The EITC program as it currently exists isnt a fix.  ,NeutralPolitics,cxah87b,6,t5_2tk0i

5800086,0,t1_cxg1kah,gt Theres got to be an overarching and possibly defeating as in making the counterargument null benefit to the fact that the minimum wage has increased in the past period.There doesnt necessarily have to be an overarching benefit for either side of this argument unless you can prove it.  Basic economic textbooks will corroborate what Ive said so far about price floors of which minimum wage is one deadweight loss competitiveness etc so I have that going for me.Most progressive types will cite the lack of a living wage for people making the current minimum which essentially renders their conditions to being slavelike i.e. cant save can barely afford to eat etc.  While this is a valid concern its really not up to businesses to provide basic living conditions for their workers.  Its either up to the workers or if they cant then such social welfare issues i.e. public policy are within the governments purview.  This means that the government should be cutting the checks to pay for social welfare but minimum wage forces businesses to do so...a bit of cognitive dissonance there.  EITC on the other hand would use government taxes to cut checks out to people so that they can make a living wage without rendering the business uncompetitive in the process.  So if the idea is that people should earn a living wage when they work EITC does it in a manner that doesnt have as many negatives as a minimum wage.  EITC is not a price floor.,NeutralPolitics,cxg20na,5,t5_2tk0i

Some states have higher gun export rates and others gun import rates which are determined by the original sale record of guns that are run through tracing databases.This is weird because its a government agency which Id expect to try to maintain neutrality but the ATF has a statistic called time to crime which ... as far as I can tell is not a time to crime but rather the time between a guns sale and when it is checked in the tracing database. Such a check could be the result of being considered evidence in a criminal matter even then not necessarily being used in said crime. Or it could be an informationonly check for instance in a gun being doublechecked for legitimacy at a gun show. Seems really ... NonNeutral to call it time to crime but if you can take the terminology with a grain of salt it gives you a in my opinion pretty good ballpark idea of how guns move around from State to State.

And that our children growup to own homes with a microwave and two vehicles. This is what I mean by subsistence. It isnt merely the life of the individual that has a subsistence but the nature and organization of the goods and services that interact with the individual. It is social and economic infrastructure.gtExplain how someone not going hungry would have a lifespan shorter than someone going hungry.There are too many variables to control for. For example there is this research that actually shows some evidence that limited starvation may increase lifespan. Likewise there are diseases that are associated with different levels of consumption and types of consumption.gtTheres not enough context from what you quoted in your source to assert that either Malthus or Ricardo believe that subsistence must include luxuries. In fact they seem to be making my point....that we should be focusing on bread and not flowers when it comes to necessary consumption i.e. a subsistence level of consumption.Reread Ricardo. He is saying that flowers constitute subsistence and bread does not if workers buyuse flowers but not bread for example if only nonworkers used bread.gtust because they are part of the general habits of the laboring population does not at all mean that they should be considered necessary consumption.Necessary for what? For reproduction of our current society? Yes. Necessary to prevent death? No. A subsistence wage does not merely prevent death it enables the continuation and reproduction of a society. Subsistence means to continue to exist. In economics we are not speaking about merely the existence of the person but the existence of whatever infrastructure facilitates human society. That infrastructure should continue to exist. When wages are below subsistence there is a decay of this infrastructure.,NeutralPolitics,cygqeh1,0,t5_2tk0i

6284268,0,t3_41o1nt,gtSo what now? How do we balance the internets potential for discussion with inclination towards the worst aspects of human behaviour.I try to remember that Im going to die and that theres nothing I can do about it.No matter how healthy I eat no matter how much I exercise no matter how wonderfully I take care of my body its going to keep getting older and slowly get worse and worse at doing what its supposed to with several systems deteriorating maybe all at once   and at some point the whole thing will just stop working and I will die.So if my body is so clearly fallible isnt my mind fallible?  If Im mortal why should my cognitive abilities be infinite? Theres stuff about my physical capacity and skill I have thats significantly better than average in places I dedicated time to and stuff thats significantly worse than average in stuff Ive neglected and most of it is frankly stunningly average.I think the same is more or less true about my mental faculty. Theres the same deal of experience training talent etc. that distinguishes mine from others  in a good way in a bad way and in no way at all and the same deal of fallibility.So thats kind of how I try to be in real life and on the internet when Im talking to another human being about things we might disagree about.Theres also moderation which requires a little bit of work and requires moderators to be willing to check themselves and other moderators willing to check each other.I personally tend to feel a little skeevy about removing comments and very comfortable not approving submissions because both tilt the threshold of me changing whats in the NP space to be higher than lower. But I also tend to run things by the other mods because I am a human being whos bitten the inside of his own mouth and tongue often enough just trying to chew food that I know I am fallible. gtgetting rid of anonymous accounts? NOPEThis is something where  Im willing to take a strong position.Even though Im kinda young I remember the preeveryone on the internet times despite growing up in the everyone my age on the internet times leading to the current everyone on the internet situation. Theres a definite degree of frankness to say nothing of information leaks to citizens and ease of self publishing of high quality content reaching a massive audience that exists when people dont have to constantly put their real social reputation at risk within a real life community they cant just leave or be kicked out of without severe material cost and a bewildering amount of perspective people are willing to share interculturally and intergenerationally when they dont have to feel vulnerable about it. It does lead to trolling perverse stuff fluff stuff amateur stuff masterful stuff etc. and it does lead to really toxic stuff sometimes but thats where I think moderators willing to check themselves and check each other and be checked by each other comes into play.Theres always going to be an individualcollective tension when it comes to whats good to have out there and whats bad  but I feel I know it when I see it.gtwebsites are not required to host your freedom of expression and can censor and moderate as they please.This is something Im not currently comfortable with I think the internet space should have some kind of analogue to people being able to shout and have the human ears around them hear what they have to say   humanity has had this for a long long time and the basic mechanics of logarithmic scale for volume physical people being required to join in amplifying coherent speech etc. have served us pretty damn well in effecting change in preserving traditions in displaying content and discontent etc.Right now theres nothing like the space that is human voice in the air where anyone can participate just as easily as being born without a physical deformity and being raised to speak thoughts in a language fluently.  Thats because theres a monetary cost to having internet communications there are laws governing those systems and that means internet spaces are basically never quite as free from financial or political interest as just regular person to person interaction.That has good and bad things about it but for now the internet is still mostly on the good side of things IMHO.Whatever you think about Alexis Ohanian and Reddits administration and Im sure someone coming into this thread has an opinionOne of my favorite subReddits actually interesting I think to this discussion is called Neutral Politics.

Also Americans do  years of posthigh school education until they graduate as a doctor while Europe for the most part does  since they go right into medical school.

The state literally has to require that they do for them to do it. To Ron Pauls point  gt No one has the right to force a healthcare provider to labor for themThis is the Kim Davis defense.

If Hilliary becomes President she will have Bernie and Warren making headlines as the liberal wing and then plenty of right wingers making headlines as the conservative wing. She would be set up to quite easily play her policies as the middle the compromise. The other part of your argument is that young voters will continue to come out to vote. Young voters making the difference in the election was the same thing that was said at different points in the    and  elections and it never came true. Dont confuse reaching a vocal minority of young voters with reaching the entire population of young voters. If history is any indicator young voters will not come out in large numbers. They just by and large havent ever been interested. Even if Bernie is the one politician to change that its hard to believe that he will also change the historically lack of success Presidents have in mid term elections.Even if Bernie is able to overcome the dynamics of youth voters in not one but two elections than he still faces the problem of the make up of congressional districts simply favoring Republicans. Unless he spends two years fighting gerrymandering or managing to pass new laws about congressional districts structurally he will face major problems. The Senate is not much different as the pure number of safe Republican seats makes it more difficult for Democrats to win the Senate as well.So what Im saying is if your argument rests on Sanders winning back Congress I think thats a very unlikely prospect for any Democratic President in the near term without structural changes.Edit  Sources Midterms Youth vote more on midterms and structural issues,NeutralPolitics,czvg237,5,t5_2tk0i

You should try researching her biography use multiple sources because her preFirst Lady career is very transparent about the issues she was especially passionate about.Her senior thesis was on the radical Saul Alinsky a marxist and a very farleft activist and reporters and biographers have speculated for years whether she sympathized with him fyi this was back in the s and early s when it was a bad thing to be called a socialist or a communist. This has been an avenue of attack by the GOP party for decades.as a law student she monitored the Black Panther trials for civil rights violations she interned for civil rights lawyer Bob Treuhaft in Arkansas she worked as a public defender and as Politico recently reported Hillary worked in the s to get a mentally handicapped black man off of death row. SourceMarian Wright Edelman a major African American activist Hillary worked for her out of law school is one of her major influential mentors. In her biographies Hillary has credited Edelman with being her most important mentor and a close friend  she has the endorsement of Edelman in the  campaign.This just scratches the surface. Hillary has many deep deep relationships and a long history when it comes to civil rights. Thats why it doesnt surprise me when the South Carolina Black Caucus endorses her for instance.On the other hand Sanders level of involvement in the Civil Rights Movement is substantially less in comparison he was vocal but not active possibly because he was living in mostlywhite Vermont.

6610659,0,t3_466nk9,Im going to argue against Linzs point because of some of my anecdotal experience in Peru. Im fully aware that Peru is not every other CentralSouth American country but the parallels are enough that I think I can use it as a basis for discussion at least.I posit having witnessed an election cycle here and another one underway as well as being informed on the history of the country and its neighbors that the instability of democracy rises from a lack of education among the constituency which permits manipulation and prohibits growth.In Peru about  of people havent finished high school. Most of these people live up in the mountains or outside of cities. When the last election came  candidates who were moderates gained the entirety of the educated vote the urban dwellers. The other two doubled down on the rural areas and as they held the majority of people they won. Those two were not the best candidates had no experience one of them had tried a military coup and he won in the runoff.The point of the example is that these disadvantaged populations turn into a source of voters for candidates who arent going to contribute as much to stability. They preach hard left values and lean socialist promising change only it doesnt come. Look at what Venezuela has done with Maduro in place of Chavez its the same rhetoric directed at the same class of people. The end result is those same people who were targeted in the election get ignored later allowing civil unrest to ferment and rise. This leads to more radical changes such as military governments and bigger swings from president to president which undermine stability. Contrast this with the US a nation founded by extremely intelligent enlightened men. Educations penetration in the US is greater.  ,NeutralPolitics,d033j8f,4,t5_2tk0i

6654406,0,t1_d07khba,gt The jobs number from point one seems large could you break it down in any way to clarify what effect leaving the EU would have on UK jobs?gt Similar for point two how would leaving the EU impact UK exports.The effect on jobs and exports is obviously very difficult to predict. The biggest problem is that it isnt clear what the UKEU relationship would look like in the event of a Brexit I really hate that word I dont know why we all seem to have settled on it. Countries like Norway and Switzerland have signed comprehensive free trade deals with the EU which make their economies part of the single market and guarantee free movement of people to and from the EU. They also provide some funding to the EU and have to implement various EU regulations. In other words for many purposes these countries might as well be part of the EU. Its very likely that Cameron or any other proEuropean prime minister and perhaps even a weakly eurosceptic one would seek to negotiate a similar agreement.gt For points four and especially five Britains not being part of the EU doesnt disallow these from happening.These things have to be agreed on an international level  its very arguable that the existence of the EU helps.gt Im not sure what point six is referring to since breaking the law is still breaking the law and Britain doesnt need to be part of the EU to enforce its laws.Ultimately if a multinational doesnt want to follow a markets rules they can just pull out. Its a lot more costly for them to pull out of the whole EU single market than just the UK so the EU can push regulation further. Its just another variation on three really.gt Number eleven seems to misunderstand the way common rules work. Its not like energy is wasted writing them down in the separate countries. If the rules really are similar theyll be similar anyway and theres no need for membership to remove membership. If they arent similar then the argument is bullshit on its face. Either way Britains membership has nothing to do with laws in other EU countries so see my first sentence.The point is that if different countries have different regulations businesses that operate in multiple countries will often have to waste effort in ensuring that they conform to all of them. For example a manufacturer might need to produce different versions of their products to satisfy the regulations in different countries or they might have to separately test their products against two largely similar standards.,NeutralPolitics,d07mg3o,5,t5_2tk0i

And both of these issues matter and both intersect because the most meaningful fights for LGBT equality healthcare housing suicide and mental health nondiscrimination laws also tend to be linked to economic oppression.    ,NeutralPolitics,d0ic487,1,t5_2tk0i

6764986,0,t1_d0ipnqo,Theoretically if Im queen and make the rules my thought process for my ideal society is that the most important thing is society.Taxes should exist to improve society.  Build roads build infrastructure build schools.  Provide health care provide social safety nets assure that no one goes hungry and no one is out on the street.  To me this is more important than foreign aid or military spending.Businesses should exist to benefit society.  They exist to provide jobs to provide goods andor services and to stimulate the economy.With that in mind one person with  Billion dollars benefits society less than  people with  Million dollars.  They in turn benefit society less than  people with  dollars.  The reason I believe this is because the economy is benefited by spending and a few people hoarding money arent spending that money.  That money would do more good if it were in the hands of a sociallyfocused government funding social programs and schools and work programs rather than sitting in offshore bank accounts.  Instead of a private citizen investing it to grow their wealth the government should invest it to grow THEIRS.Granted the big problem where this all falls apart is that such a system requires the government to be trustworthy and not heavily harmed by corruption.  And I dont really think thats the case.But I still believe that money does more good when its in more hands not fewer.,NeutralPolitics,d0j39xu,1,t5_2tk0i

6876074,0,t1_d0vmaoq,Obamacare doesnt provide health coverage it is a system for insuring citizens. For example the Kaiser plan my SO is on still has her dealing with Kaiser rather than the government. Kaiser simply has to adhere to regulations placed on it. Im oversimplifying it but thats my understanding. People who know better please educate me.Medicare for all under Sanders plan bypasses insurance companies and gives everyone direct access to healthcare as covered by aforementioned plan. Essentially the government itself acts as an insurance company and you deal with them.Essentially it just cuts out the insurance middleman in most cases.I dont know what it will look like exactly but I imagine it wont be too different from the Tricare system the government already uses. and I used for six years If that is the case then it will mirror my experiences in the DoD I simply had to pay about  per month for me and my wife deducted like a tax and that was it. Hospital visits medications consultations emergency care no cost no deductibles or premiums the hospital was just a place I went to when I was hurt and I would forget it when I left.I actually have never not been on Tricare so I dont know how that compares to regular civilian care. But I can link you what I as a government employee had and you can tell me if its betternot a fair comparison.Edit Doing a little reading it might be a fair comparison.

As long as you live there for  months and your parents dont claim you as a dependent you are a resident for tuition purposes Your friends parents probably just decided buying a house in Texas was cheaper than paying out of state tuition it is Texas housing is ridiculously cheap and still wanted to claim him as a dependent. In basically every state  months is the norm with a few at six months. As far as California goes so you have to support yourself for  years instead of one still a drop in the bucket in terms of a lifetime. You are also completely wrong about the marriage. As soon as you are married you are independent provided you are no longer claimed as a dependent on your parents tax returns. In that case you only have to be a resident for  days.gt Well the only way to do that would be to wait until hes far older gets married comes out of the military or basically sustains his family on his income.If by his family you mean himself then yes but that doesnt seem like a big deal.gtSo unless he wants to hang out waiting tables not going to work.Yeah what a hardship to spend a single year waiting tables. Im guessing you are still very young if that seems like a big deal to you. Think of it this way that year of waiting tables will save you k in tuition so it is an extremely well compensated year.gtthat means their parents would literally just get them an apartmentWhy would their parents be involved? It is pretty fucking easy to support yourself if you dont have other mouths to feed.gt If you maintain any ties to another state voting registration your license or registration on your car youre out of luck.No shit to declare residency in a state you have to become a resident. It doesnt seem like that big of a deal if you want to take advantage of service paid for with that states tax dollars.gtFeasible I suppose but Ive never heard of it happening.Then you have very limited experiences and most likely a very sheltered group of friends. I have know plenty of people who did this minus the parents pay for their apartment part of course. I did it myself in Hawaii along with at least  other people I knew there. I also know people who did it in Virginia where I got my second bachelors didnt have to that time since veterans get automatic instate tuition which is another way around that hurdle btw.It comes across as extremely entitled to expect free outofstate tuition someplace where you and your parents have never paid taxes.

6937161,0,t1_d126oq7,Well not quite. Yes if he wins  delegates he will go into the democratic convention leading Hillary by a single delegate but that does not mean he wins and as I said the super delegates would be very likely to give Hillary the win in that situation. In order to get  delegates he needs to win . of the remaining delegates meaning on average he has to beat Hillary by a pretty hefty margin from here on out. Anywhere he loses he has to win elsewhere by that much more and he really cant afford the kinds of big losses hes seen in the past months. So winning . of the delegates left puts him at the bare minimum where I estimate hes about  likely to still lose. I have postulated elsewhere that maybe around  delegates or so it starts to seem a little forced for super delegates to give it to Hillary. Many people would probably dispute that figure and they have every right to. I pulled it out of my ass. While the superdelegates were originally created more or less for this purpose they have never seen use in that capacity and are viewed by many I assume most? people to be an obstruction of democracy. That is my opinion at least but to each their own. In order for sanders to enter the democratic convention with a lead over Hillary by  delegates Sanders needs to win nearly  of the remaining delegates. A tall order for sure but not utterly impossible. Would a lead of that magnitude really not very large still translate into a win?

Presumably not nearly as effectively as Obama was able to capitalize on it but whether Clinton or seemingly less likely but not ruled out Sanders is able to acquire a greater share of minority votes than Kerry will presumably be telling perhaps with the exception of the Black vote which Clinton seems to be exceptional at winning. Im interested in particular in her appeal to the Hispanic voting bloc given that I understand theres been a higher birth rate among Hispanics such that her difficulty appealing to young voters may lose her votes.

Maybe Sanders was just sticking with an outdated talking point ?.gtIn fact over the past  years Verizon has paid a federal tax rate averaging just . percent on  billion in U.S. profits meaning that the company has found a way to shelter about twothirds of its U.S. profits from federal taxes over this period. In five of the last  years the company paid zero in federal taxes. While there is no indication that this spectacular feat of tax avoidance is anything but legal the companys consistently low tax rates are most likely due to overly generous accelerated depreciation tax provisions that Congress has expanded over the last decade few Americans would describe the company avoiding tax on  billion of profits as fair.Edit this is neutral politics so I should specify that when I say that they arent paying their fair share I mean that they are paying lower rates than they should be.,NeutralPolitics,d23nc14,36,t5_2tk0i

On the other hand people REALLY hate Trump and REALLY hate Clinton presuming she wins and will probably crawl through the sewage just to vote against them.

I think his party and probably his state are sick of seeing him.gtWhat does this say about the state of American politics today?I think a lot of people feel like the election system is broken. As a Bernie supporter Im questioning the wisdom of the public as they voted in a reality TV star with no political experience and a long history of shady business practices etc. The idea of direct democracy seems less appealing. However Im also questioning the judgement of the elites as they have strategically put their thumbs on the scale to force in their candidate of choice. So the idea of a controlling class now leaves an even more sour taste in my mouth than it used to. Whats interesting to me now though is how Hillary supporters will respond to the  person race. So many of them liked Bernie more but thought he couldnt win the general. Now that the general lurched forward on them and they can really weigh Bernie vs. Trump or Hillary vs Trump will they feel Hillary still has the better chance? Will Hillarys ties to Trump damage her image? I am excited to see the next round of polling. I think some Hillary supporters might decide Clinton vs. Trump is not really what I want to see.

But basically replace the kind of credit card based financing system that lurked in the shadows before  with a loose but more legit version thats similar to the student loan financing system. Supporting small businesses with ordinary SBA loans is impossible. The only practical way to get an SBA loan is if a business is really a foster child of a local government agency. Regular scruffy business owners cant usually get through the qualification process.

7718138,0,t3_4kvid0,In addition to what others have said its important to remember that MP was never intended to be a typical political party and was designed to be very inclusive and flat. Hence their use of spokespeople rather than party leaders for example. Because of that inclusiveness and because their membership is from all over the political map MP can easily be portrayed as being disorganized weak or supportive of fringe opinions when in reality its just a result of how the party was designed. This portrayal has grown stronger in recent years partly accelerated by a general rightwing shift in the political climate and picked up by media outlets as popular opinion.In summary  the controversies are real but a polarized political climate exaggerated them.

7830111,0,t3_4m9u6o,I certainly understand the practicality of genocide denial both from the denying state and its allies perspective. But it just encourages the kind of blind nationalism that papers over abuses and stifles the kind of discussions that allow nations to stitch together new more inclusive identities. I personally think the world would be a better place if states like Turkey apologized for what they did. But the apologies would literally never end. US apologizing to Japan for WWII Japan apologizing to all of Asia basically Europeans apologizing to basically the whole world To me this isnt a problem but it would certainly cause political unrest. People like to believe that theytheir nations arent capable of committing horrendous acts against others. If you ask a Belgian about the horrors of Belgian colonialsm theyd quickly say something like Oh that was then we dont do that now. But we still do just in different ways.  I think the first step to understanding human beings is understanding that you too are capable of committing horrendous atrocities. I got a little off track there but I personally believe the genocide was real. I believe scholars do as well. I feel that Turkey should apologize. Genocide denial is like killing someone twice. First you kill them. And then you kill their memory by telling the world that  Armenians simultaneously tripped and hit their heads on a rock. Its insulting honestly.

7831085,0,t1_d3vtho4,gt Serious answer why do you think spending time with your kids is a negative thing? Or a punishment of some kind? I do not believe it is a negative thing or a punishment to spend time with ones kids. I do believe it is a negative thing and a punishment for MOSTLY WOMEN ALONE to lose power pay career prospects social status and retirement savings in exchange for raising productive adults who constitute our society. Choice doesnt negate the fact that this is essential labor that our society literally would not survive without. And it doesnt negate the fact that this work is gendered so that women are left disproportionately impoverished in our society i.e. wage gap. The least we can do is stop penalizing people  mostly women  for raising children.gt Also many men would love to spend more time as caregiver but the current culture makes it very hard.Precisely. This culture is the root cause of the wage gap AND the inability of many dads to be real parents. When we speak of the wage gap it is this culture we need to fix in order to fix the wage gap so men and women have equal opportunity to choose paid work vs. unpaid caregiving. Status quo is a fakechoice where cultural pressures are weighted very heavily towards men being forced to seek paid work and chase power and women being forced to take on an unfair burden of unpaid caregiving instead of  and become financially dependent on men.  gt Its relevant because women trade money for time with their kids. Life is about trade offs. Im arguing in part that the only reason why this is a tradeoff is because of cultural devaluation of womens work. That is sexism.Consider if you will a truly matriarchal society where womens work is the only type of work thats paid... kind of like how in our world what is traditionally mens work is the only kind thats well paid.Women in such a matriarchy might argue that society would end if women didnt do procreative work so OBVIOUSLY we need to pay women kind of like how we currently argue that soldiers and police officers doing protection work deserve pay. Mens work is comparatively inessential right? Its the sort of work anyone could do the logic would go. So men should just do it because its their duty  sort of like how it used to be considered womens duty to have children. The matriarchy would enslave men at first for a few millennia and force men to do all kinds of other work to support the central enterprise of raising kids. Then mens rights would come along and men would suddenly have right to do paid work i.e. men allowed to be childcare workers.  Except other regular unpaid work would remain a  mandatory cultural  pressure on men to definitely still do it obviously without pay because its mens responsibilty to support humanity sort of like how we argue today that its monstrous for women to ask to be paid to do mothering work. If men complain about how little time they have to do paid childcare work after meeting their regular work responsibilities women would say well thats the tradeoff! You trade serious childcare time and money to do brainless truck driving and construction and mining... Thats your choice. But there really wouldnt be a choice not on a societal level. Most men would always feel incredible pressure to keep being miners and construction workers etc.Can you see what I am saying? There is nothing inherently worthless about child rearing. It is extremely useful work. You cannot simply argue this is a tradeoff the cultural assumptions behind the tradeoff is the very thing I am questioning. ,NeutralPolitics,d3wa4zp,12,t5_2tk0i

Clinton Foundation which is funded by foreign terrorist nations such as Saudi Arabia.Meanwhile Bernie gets his money from workers unions and average people. She is also friendly with the Democratic party establishment. The establishment and the proestablishment neoconservative media has done all they can to blackmail Sanders. These attacks include Bernie owes an apology to the school shooting victims because he once voted for a bill that protected the gun manufacturers from being sued if someone commits a crime with their guns. Constant pestering about why isnt bernie dropping out?. Before the California primary AP declared Clinton the winner claiming she has hit the required delegate count to become the nominee. This is false. Superdelegates havent voted yet. Shes the winner once they do. Whenever a Bernie supporter goes to for example CNN they treat them like children.  Berniebros myth Bernie is a misogynist for saying Excuse me im speaking. in a debate Bernie is a misogynist for pointing with his fingers at Clinton.Smug behavior by Clinton Hillary Clinton claiming to be the nominee before California primary.  Refusing to debate Sanders. Bill Clinton breaking the law by appearing in voting places. Talking about how young voters will fall in line to support her in the generals.  Talking about how Bernies plans are unrealistic. Ive lived in Germany for a year and spent time in other European countries as well. I can also look at statistics. How are his plans unrealistic when similar plans are common in dozens of other countries.Her untrustworthiness and voting record She was against same sex marriage four years ago. I will not vote for a homophobe. Now shes claiming she has always supported same sex marriage. Her poor judgement in important decisions like Iraq war private email server usage and intervention in Libya. Super predators. Using white noise machine against the press. She even changes her accent when in different states.I dont believe a word she says. She claims to be against the big banks but at the same time takes millions from them in donations. She could nuclear weapons against ISIS in the middle east and I wouldnt even be surprised. E Then theres the outright scary stuff.

7905580,1,t1_d44lvj8,gtCould it be that TV media cover more Clinton because the viewers prefer Clinton and internet media cover more Sanders because the viewers prefer Sanders? Obviously media are selfinterested and they choose their content to best attract viewership.It could be but that is still media bias the news is the news its supposed to inform people while catering to their audiences to a certain point.gtAs for the statistical evidence you provide above only that in  is included Sanders only rises to national recognition in late  so you are comparing the number of an intenselyspeculatedandcoveredallyear Clinton campaign and that of Sanders campaign which gets effectively no coverage during the st quarter of  mild coverage during the nd and rd quarters and rising coverage during the th quarter? Do you think youre biased here?Up until about  minutes ago that was the most recent study on media mentions I could find. Until I found a followup on the second study I posted done by Decision DataThis extends the coverage all the way to mid march which is what you had criticized me for. I can only show you what data is out there and this is the most recent I found.From the articlegt. People watching the news are older and older people are more interested in hearing about Clinton. gt. People using Google to do research are younger thus inflating the Google searches for Sanders.gtEven if explanation  is true biasing coverage to an audiences choice candidate is still media bias. I dont know the hearts of network executives but ultimately it doesnt matter whether theyre biasing coverage for viewership profit or to intentionally influence the public towards their views. When I speak of bias I simply mean that there is more coverage and it has nothing to do with poll numbers.This is precisely my view if you are catering coverage towards one certain candidate more than another regardless of your audience that is an inherent media bias.gtMore importantly a followup analysis between Clinton and Sanders seems to cast a lot of doubt on both explanation  and .Graph in question We can see that Sanders Press mentions per google search is paltry compared to Clintons up until we get to the end of the graph at March th. Now you and others may claim this is proof there was no media bias when in fact this very data point proves there was inherently a media bias in the beginning of the primary from September all the way to the beginning of March past when Iowa NH and Nevada voted of which Sanders tied  and Won  same as Clinton where she tied  and won .gtThis is one of the most fascinating graphs Ive ever seen simply because it shows a clear and unexplained trend. Im going to assume that the national TV audience and the demographics of Google searchers hasnt changed much in the last two months. Why then has Sanders gone from a  media mention deficit per Google search to a  ratio? In case youre curious the correlation between absolute coverage and Google searches is even stronger than before  for Sanders  for Clinton.My point was made above on this statementgtA cynical person might also look at the graph above and think Of course the media is covering Sanders fairly now that hes no longer a threat. I try not to infer human intent from data analysis so I have no stance on whether this is proof of intentional media bias. Id recommend all readers do the same. That said its clear this is further proof of media bias beyond demographic interest and I honestly dont have a way to explain the data above. Go ahead and light up the comments section again if you think you have an answer.This is what my view is according to the data we have on hand it is clear that up until March th when this study was posted that Sanders has been greatly ignored by the media until Super Tuesday which was on March th. Now I believe the media decided to start covering him due to the sole fact that they knew he was going to get blown out of the water in practically every single state which he did and the media expected him to drop out after Clinton had gained the insurmountable delegate lead which is why they had no reason to not cover him. However I will say I wont make this my concrete decision on this matter I will wait for more data to come in and hopefully we can fully get an answer on this where no doubt is left.But there is clearly something going on here where even the author admits that he doesnt want to make a stone conclusion.gtThe next interesting thing is that the late January and early March surges in Google interest for both scandals come at about the same time. Both spikes correspond with major email releases from the State Department. The impact is fully reversed this time. A spike in searches results in a lower coveragetosearch ratio meaning the media didnt seem as interested in the emails as online users were.Something else I find interesting as a point of bias for Clinton is that during her email scandal on days when searches were higher for information about her emails and scandal itself media coverage was in fact lower. Meaning that on days when the state department released emails media coverage was actually lower on it while internet searches skyrocketed.gtThe conclusion of the studygtThe narrowing discrepancy between Sanders and Clinton coverage is a bit of a mystery. Maybe network execs felt the Bern? Maybe it was just too hard to ignore him when he was winning states. Regardless the longitudinal data does imply neither young people Googling Sanders nor old people demanding news on Clinton are sufficient explanation for the historical  bias in Clintons favor.,NeutralPolitics,d44nv68,-2,t5_2tk0i

This method has never been used. Because of the heavy burden required to amend the US Constitution politicians who announce support for constitutional amendments to advance policies which are not broadly supported are seen as either naive or as grandstanding windbags. The Republicans Federal Marriage Amendment suffered this kind of criticism since it seemed apparent to most people that with only  of American citizens supporting such an amendment in  it would never pass.Proposed amendments may also be criticized if their substance is not important enough to warrant a constitutional amendment or if a federal statute would serve just as well. Opponents of the Federal Marriage Amendment pointed out that DOMA the Defense of Marriage Act was a federal statute which defined marriage as between a man and woman and thus the Amendment was unnecessary. Of course DOMA was struck down as unconstitutional more recently so I guess the Republicans were right in one respect. It was also criticized because if passed it would be the only constitutional amendment existing specifically to limit the rights of private citizens and the states ability to expand those rights for themselves since the th Amendment introduced the prohibition of alcohol and that this would be worse as it would limit rights of a specific and suspect class of Americans.SO... it isnt that advocating an amendment to the constitution is generally seen as a political sin but that amendments are viewed with a great deal of skepticism so far as whether it has a chance of passing and whether an amendment is the most appropriate tool to implement the policy change intended.,NeutralPolitics,d4q293b,1,t5_2tk0i

So the real context which the media and general discourse seems to be missing is that there very likely was an established and official way that Clinton as Secretary handled classified information. Using a personal email rather than a .gov email account intended for unclassified information was very careless and against State Department policy but not criminal in any demonstrable way. The small amounts of classified material that did show up on her server was likely an unintended mistake as would then be the delivery of such material to uncleared individuals such as her attorneys or IT support and given that the relevant laws require Clintons full knowledge is not an illegal mistake.Thank you very much for the discussion I learned a lot from talking to you.

Therefore one can quite easily view the terror attack in the shopping mall in neighbouring Kenya as a guerilla attack against Kenya who were helping in the war against Somalia.  These sorts of guerilla attacks are all you can do if youre fighting in war against a bigger power who you cannot match militarily.

8551669,0,t3_4wudoo,First it would depend on the actual singlepayer model Different models have different payment structures Often the government acts as the insurer and negotiates prices or salariesfor example in Canada the government negotiates prices with doctors and private medical associations. I think Canadian doctors are not allowed to charge more than those rates but maybe a Canadian can chime in if Im wrong. But many countries have a twotiered system in which doctors are free to charge what they want and if they charge more than the governmentset fee for a procedure the patient is required to pay the difference.The two most common singlepayer models mentioned in the U.S. recently have been Medicare for all and a public option that eventually grows and becomes singlepayer.The government sets fees under Medicare now and doctors incomes would surely drop if we went to Medicare for all.A public option is usually envisioned as a governmentrun insurance program and as such the government would negotiate fees with doctors. The larger the public option becomes the more powerful the government would be in the negotiations and the more likely fees would drop and physicians would make less.This Atlantic article has a list of U.S. doctors incomes that varies a little from OPs list. Yet all the average salaries in the Atlantic list and all but one in the list in OPs link fall within the top  of income in the U.S. and many fall within the top  Without making any kind of value judgment the fact remains that most doctorsand especially specialistsin the U.S. are well paid.If true single payer ever comes about doctors incomes would most likely drop. But I expect more help would be offered with education costs. Maybe forgiveness of some school loans in exchange for practicing in underserved areas maybe extremely low interest rates for schooling maybe better federal grants for school costs. It would be foolish to pull the financial rug out from under doctors feet without offering some sort of compensation for the very high school costs.,NeutralPolitics,d6aj5cg,22,t5_2tk0i

Second Ill admit that I originally misread the original comment as referring to the number of citations in the article not of the article. Three I dont think something as abstract as quality can be collapsed into impact. The best test of quality remains reproducibility. Id rather know that a finding has been reproduced than know that it has been referenced by peers. In the absence of other knowledge citations are a useful metric  and since theyre easily measured theyre good for making comparisons among large quantities of articles. It seems less useful as a way to think about one article. Im sure there are examples where two articles with contrasting findings are more often than not cited together because they as a set capture something important about the field. That tells you those articles are impactfull and contribute to the conversation which are elements of a quality paper but neither is authoritative. A hiring committee might be interested in hiring both candidates which isnt an endorsement of the findings of either. Thats just one example of how impact factor can be more complicated than it appears at first blush.So maybe its not a poor proxy but its certainly reductionist and incomplete.,NeutralPolitics,d6y49v0,0,t5_2tk0i
8751442,0,t1_d6zjnyu,Sure thing!The majority of people have always been ignorant of all the fine details of history government law and more. In fact pre education was a commodity and most people certainly never saw the inside of a university. Most people were farmers and laborers working in coal mines and very concerned with their very immediate survival. One mine opened and hordes of men lined up looking for work with most turned away in the end. And always politicians have misinformed them shouting about rights or morals or jobs telling them what they want to hear and then enacting policy that was not in their best interests after all. Railroads plowed through homes corporations ate up farms moral leaders fell from grace it wasnt so different than it is today.But the real difference is now entire television networks newspaper outlets and websites are owned or otherwise funded by billionaires who with their virtuallylimitless resources can crank out all the spin and misinformation they could ever want and it floods the media. Just as the s brought us scientist as hero characters in movies ss cinema gave us the newspaper man that plucky and moralizing hero who ran down the corrupt politicians and organized crime bosses and exposed their lies shining light on their darkness. Those days are dead and gone. Today the media promotes talking points and propaganda stories and so do our politicians. And both are owned by the same handful of rich men. How can we possibly hope that the average voter will educate themselves so fully as to combat all of these things. Worse much of the recent past is fairly invisible and in some cases unattainable. Sure I can find articles about Obama from  but finding them from  about Bush is catchascatchcan given how nascent the internet was. So if you were too young to remember or even know what went on in the late s world of politics for example youre reliant on what you can find. And all this research has to be done when youre not working to put food on the table or care for sick family members or whatever your personal burden is. Again like the past people today focus more on their immediate circumstances than becoming historians and lawyers in what constitutes their spare time.Thus most people depend on the media to sort it out for them. They graze the headlines in the grocery store or browse Google news for a few minutes now and then. And if all the headlines are spinladen bunk they really have no idea but they walk away with an awful lot of misconceptions misconceptions that greatly benefit those who proffer them. I think if we want to reduce voter ignorance finding ways even legal solutions to reduce the purposeful proliferation of the misinformation keeping them ignorant would be a really great place to begin. People have to know they can trust their media. Its not a joke and its not just some other show on TV. When massive crises happen these are the places we turn to for information to save our lives.

And they have made food cheaper no doubt. But they or their kids had other places to go because the other stuff hadnt yet been computerizedtechonlogized.Whats going to change in the next  years I think is that the displaced workers will increasingly not have that landing strip. Right now a lot of my Midwestern IT coworkers are farmers kids. But they could land in IT because IT was a thing. IT will go away eventually when the dream of selfprogramming computers comes to complete fruition. Computer I need a program that accepts inputs X Y and Z and turns them into A B and C. Even the design will be automatable at that point though and so the I need will be abstracted even further out. And not coincidentally largely placed in the hands of the big corporations who can afford the tech.

9486146,0,t3_5apy6l,Trump has  bullet points.  Going through them in turn.gtCompletely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.There is much more to Obamacare than the individual mandate.  The other key components are Guaranteed issue  community rating no denial or higher premiums for preexisting conditions Subsidies for purchase by households under  of the poverty line A large expansion of medicaid for persons under  of the poverty line originally intended to be national but mandatory expansion was struck down in NFIB v. Sebilius.The Trump plan does not say anything about the first two bullets and the later point about Medicaid seems to indicate a desire to reduce the scope of those programs.  Given the stated desire to repeal and the atleastnotexpansion of Medicaid that would mean about  million people would lose health insurance.gtModify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up.This makes no sense.Obamacare currently allows interstate compacts which do this.  Given that no two states have identically comprehensive regulatory schemes a law allowing interstate sales if the plan meets the regulations of the nd state is meaningless  it inherently wont.  This policy would in fact make interstate sales even more difficult than they are now since for it to work two states would need to make their entire insurance regulatory apparatuses mesh.gtAllow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldnt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.This would almost exclusively benefit relatively wealthy people who have enough deductions to justify taking itemized deductions.  Especially if Trump were to enact his tax plan which would greatly increase the standard deduction.The portion about review the basic options for Medicaid does not actually propose anything and therefore I am ignoring.gtAllow individuals to use Health Savings Accounts HSAs. Contributions into HSAs should be taxfree and should be allowed to accumulate. These accounts would become part of the estate of the individual and could be passed on to heirs without fear of any death penalty. These plans should be particularly attractive to young people who are healthy and can afford highdeductible insurance plans. These funds can be used by any member of a family without penalty. The flexibility and security provided by HSAs will be of great benefit to all who participate.This is already the law.gtRequire price transparency from all healthcare providers especially doctors and healthcare organizations like clinics and hospitals. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures exams or any other medicalrelated procedure.This is called allpayerrate setting and is by far the most interesting bullet point on the list.  Maryland has operated a scheme like this for hospitals since the s. though while it has kept costs per unit of care down Maryland hospitals had strong incentives to push a lot of procedures to keep profits up.gtBlockgrant Medicaid to the states. Nearly every state already offers benefits beyond what is required in the current Medicaid structure. The state governments know their people best and can manage the administration of Medicaid far better without federal overhead. States will have the incentives to seek out and eliminate fraud waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources.This would effectively be a large cut to Medicaid programs especially during recessions when demand for safety net programs spikes.  You would likely see something like you see with Section  housing now where people wait years to get onto the program and people often jockey just to get on the waiting list for the program.gtRemove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe reliable and cheaper products. Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America. Though the pharmaceutical industry is in the private sector drug companies provide a public service. Allowing consumers access to imported safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.Allowing imports of drugs is mostly a fine idea.  ,NeutralPolitics,d9idcxz,137,t5_2tk0i

9645468,0,t1_da1uwt6,Fine take our progress globally. Now what?What happens when there is a finite amount of man hours to make the world go round that doesnt result in everyone working full time? What do you do with the  when only the  NEEDS to work to keep the world spinning? I realize im taking this to the extreme and the time line could be  years or  years but wouldnt it be better to start planning for this optimistic future?  Some would argue the real unemployment right now is over  what do we do with those people? Weve already figured out that the economy doesnt need them to function. Do we really need people working in fast food kitchens instead of robots? If we can make a mcdonalds function using a few regional system techs instead of dozens of people in each store shouldnt we do it? Very few people would choose to work fast food and I would argue them sitting at home doing nothing is more valuable to society than them working at a job they hate. If some one has a passion for working fast food more power to them. They can work there as many hours as they want. The end game as I see it again time line is entirely unknown everyone has foodwatersheltertransportationconnectivityhealthcaresmall what ever budget that comes in the form of a monthly deposit to their bank. There will still be some crap jobs no one really wants to do but people would still do it for a day a week for a little extra spending money. When you free people from having to worry about the necessities they can focus on whatever they want. That guy with the idea to create that next big thing doesnt have to wait tables and put off tinkering in the garage so they have a roof over their head. People that have a passion for science can research what they want instead of having to research what they can get grants for. Yes this would require drastic changes and would necessarily limit just how much the person with the most has compared to the person with the least. If everyone made somewhere between  and  million in todays dollars a year with the first  just magically showing up in their account would we really be worse off than we are today?going into the next section without knowing the outcome of my hypothetical situationPersonal income in the US is around  trillion a year or about  a person. Note only about a two thirds of the population is actually working age and only  of those are working that inflates the  per person in the workforce is about . Youll notice only about a third of people in the US are active in the workforce.So lets assume from the day you are born until the day you die you get  as a base salary just for being alive. Yes this money comes from wealth redistribution. Yes I am stealing from the rich. so  people  comes to  Trillion dollars of the  Trillion in individual income. So you only have  Trillion left to distribute. Only a third of people are actually in the workforce. So that means you get to spread that  Trillion across  people. If you did it evenly each of those people would get  more for a total of  a year. Now this wouldnt be distributed evenly because obviously the fast food guy working  shift a week shouldnt make as much as the scientist creating new cancer treatments  hours a week. So lets say  people split  trillion. Each of them would get  a year. Lets say  million split the next  Trillion. Each of them get  a year.Were at the last million people. Sure we could divide them more but lets just say they split the last  Trillion dollars. They each get . Now we split up the total  trillion dollars in personal income from . Every person in the US makes between  and . We havent figured out how we pay to operate our government yet. Total LocalStateFederal tax spending was roughly . trillion in .So we need to figure out how to effectively tax the  Trillion paid out in salaries to get to . trillion in tax revenue. Obviously some of that spending would no longer exist because everyone is getting money. There shouldnt be a need for food stamps housing stipends social security payments ect. So even with todays total personal income it is feasible to redistribute so every one makes at least  a year and no one makes more than  a year before taxes. Hell everyone paying  in taxesfederalstatelocal would enable government spending to remain unchanged. No more super rich but i dont know that that is that big of a deal.In this scenario with a family of  not working their salary would be  before taxes and  after taxes. Of course you could say everyone under  gets less per year but the more complicated the rules the more things can be twisted one way or the other. We probably dont want to encourage popping out kids. So maybe after  no more money until they are  but the government has still covered all of foodwatersheltertransportationconnectivityhealthcaresmall what ever budget for them so they arent turning with any debt or anything. Maybe less for dependants in general. Average cost of raising a kid to  is  or roughly  a year in the US so maybe something like  a kid for the first . end hypotheticalYeah i made a lot of assumptions and people probably would be upset about the  kid limit but it was an interesting hypothetical for me to run through. ,NeutralPolitics,da204q0,1,t5_2tk0i

Look what the number one Urban Dictionary result is for white people. Media and social narratives about white people being racist or pathetic. Its a constant demonization of white people.

It honestly baffles me how people cling to the idea of rightleft conservativeliberal like the wide range of human experience values and policy stances can exist as points on a number line. For example as a leftist libertarian I believe in a strong safety net and UBI universal basic income but also in general disengagement of government from most aspects of social and interpersonal life  marriage religion and drug use for example.  I think the government exists to protect and take care of individuals not to tell them what they can and cannot do with their lives outside of preventing direct or inadvertent see environmental damage harm to other people.  I think there are times and domains the government should have a strong hand in unlike true libertarians I guess such as environmental regulation as well as its implicit responsibility to promote a positive progression of humanity so science funding gradual implementation of UBI handinhand with the upgrading of manual labor forces with increasingly sophisticated technology a serious space exploration plan.

Prior to that anyone who escapedor who talked about it assisted someone else or collected rafting materialswas subject to one to ten years in prison.While Albelos voyage was sensational it is a journey that thousands have taken mainly during four different time periods leaving imprints across the modern history of Miami. The first was after Castro took power in  and began confiscating private factories farms and houses. This spurred a person exodus to the U.S. largely of the business elite. The fathers of both Carlos the developer and Ivan my translator left during this period the latter under Operation Pedro Pan when thousands of Cuban parents sent their children to Miami alone to live with relatives rather than endure Marxist indoctrination in Castros schools. Another  followed from  after Congress organized Freedom Flights for Cubans. In  when Jimmy Carter reopened diplomatic ties with Cubaand just a week after Albelo was imprisonedCastro authorized the Mariel Boatlift exporting . The fourth mass exodus of  occurred in . The fall of the Soviet Union just years before had deprived Cuba of a major trading partner causing food and electricity shortages. When people tried leaving Castro punished them but finally let them go amid riots. Since then the U.S. has issued  visas to Cubans annually but theyre in such high demand that obtaining one feels like hitting the lottery and even applying for onemuch less buying a plane ticketis expensive on an island where many live on month.

9773386,0,t1_dahkqp2,Im downvoting your comments because your description of the economic problems of socialism are superficial and largely inaccurate due to overgeneralization.Most socialist systems e.g. USSR China East Germany attempted to undergo rapid economic development after socialization. They collectivized farms not primarily to produce more food but to make production more efficient so that workers could leave the farm and move into industrial production. The Great Leap Forward was a disaster for exactly this reason expecting massive productivity gains they shifted agricultural workers and capital investments into the cities and industry and the resulting famine killed millions. In this and many other cases being a farmer did not mean you stayed a farmer.Additionally in all of those countries being the child of the proletariat e.g. farmers and laborers gave you greater access to higher education and university. So being born to a farmer family certainly did not mean you would also be a farmer.Finally access to certain education paths e.g. becoming a doctor was restricted and allocated based on the planned economy in most cases. That sucked for people that wanted to become something the government didnt need but the doctorgttaxi driver phenomenon you described didnt exist. People couldnt choose their career freely based on where the money was because work assignments were usually not chosen freely by the workers. In many socialist countries at many points in time money wasnt worth anything and rationing coupons and other privileges were the primary economic motivator.Let me know if people need cites on all this and Ill come back and add them at a later point when I have more time. The above comes from studying the history of socialism in China Germany and to a lesser extent Russia.,NeutralPolitics,dahsb6g,1,t5_2tk0i

Unless CA or the federal government provides a free ID to citizens theyll be taken to court for strict voter ID laws and lose just like TX and WI did. So CAs New Motor Voter law still tries to make voter registration easier and the AB IDs encourage undocumented immigrants to get a government ID and could theoretically improve election security.

Prior to the deal Carrier was going to build a new facility in Mexico and eliminate  positions in America by hiring employees in Mexico. After the deal Carrier is still going to build a new facility in Mexco and eliminate around  positions in America by hiring employees in Mexico.Just on those two points alone I think a reasonable person could argue this is not an example of Trump keeping jobs in the US.  Carrier still has a shiny new facility in Mexico filled with people doing jobs that used to be performed by Americans.  Assuming they dont scrap their current facility design for a smaller one they will still have a facility capable of absorbing the work of those  total jobs. Prior to the deal Hoosier taxpayers were not going to give money from the public coffers their tax dollars to CarrierUnited Technologies. After the deal Hoosier taxpayers are going to give around  million out of  billion state budget but every dollar counts yes? to CarrierUnited TechnologiesJust on those two points alone I think a reasonable person could argue that this is not an example of Trump making companies pay when they move jobs out of the country.I believe there are other issues with the deal based on facts we know.  I am also extremely confident that the quality of economic forecasting is so poor as to be useless.  The only thing we can really know is what we have now not what magical outcomes Future Economists will ascribe to this deal like growth or longterm costsbenefits etc..

9886631,0,t1_daw0ivi,Well huff post is far from neutral. I still gave the article a read. The problem is there is so many problems that it would take years to fix. With the partisan politics of todays world I cant imagine there would be any sweeping amendment to the law anytime soon. By the time that the ACA would be amended to the point where Obama or the democrats would be satisfied Americans who are seeing increases for  at a minimum costs are expected to rise  would be going broke. Im a moderate conservative who did not vote for Obama but agreed we needed healthcare reform. Id be interested in an amendment that would allow for cross state competition to allow for costs to drop or an amendment of the sorts while keeping ACA intact. Im not aware of this ever being made an option. Never understood why they made it state only options. ,NeutralPolitics,daw91su,10,t5_2tk0i

9937444,0,t3_5hs15b,I can only speak for myself I dont know what the average opinion is because I dont really talk about this with people due to the stigma associated with it.I find it likely that the Earth is warming although there are issues with the data gathering processes and that humans contribute in no small part to this warming. However I believe that claims of certainty with regard to the effects of global warming are drastically overstated. As an economist I work with statistical and mathematical models including forecasting  frequently in my work and the largest thing that Ive learned is that modeling complicated dynamic systems with any real certainty is hard. Very hard. Stating that we know for certain all the relevant processes which drive something as large and complicated as the global climate and accurately model them despite potential unforeseeable stochastic effects strikes me as highly arrogant at the very least. Already many of the more dire predictions have been shown to be quite out of line with whats transpired. Given this underaccountedfor uncertainty measuring the costs and benefits of public policy to specifically address climate change is more difficult than most let on. Im very skeptical of something like a carbon tax which has almost no benefit outside of potential climate concerns whereas alternative energy programs can positively impact the environment and the overall economy in ways orthogonal to the actual realized effects of climate change.Further I believe that too little emphasis is placed on the potential positives of a warming world warm periods in Earths history are almost always wetter periods and while some areas will certainly be adversely affected vast areas of land will be positive impacted. Opening Siberia and Northern Canada to agriculture could be hugely valuable. That said its difficult to know exactly what the costbenefit split would be without having an accurate forecast of the effects of climate change.Therein lies the fundamental problem were basing potentially incorrect conclusions based on layeruponlayer of difficult to prove assumptions. If any of them are wrong the whole thing comes crumbling down.Lastly people underestimate the effect of potential new technology. Much like the demographic transition these things tend to work toward a natural equilibrium of some sort. Should the effects of climate change prove severe theres reason to think the market especially in political economy terms would naturally incentivize the creation of carbon scrubbers or some other largescale engineering works which could help alleviate or even reverse the effects as the aforementioned uncertainty would no longer be an issue.,NeutralPolitics,db2vhfq,82,t5_2tk0i

9938360,0,t1_db2vgzb,gtThese pollsters are good too and with so many doing it most biases show up pretty quickly. They have methods they do statistical analysis they calculate margins of error theyve been doing this for decades and there are clear ways to verify if theyre correct. And usually they are. They dont get peer review exactly but even if they did its tough to see how itd help in this case when nearly all were wrong.gtAnd heres the thingI dont doubt their methods were valid. I dont think they fudged the data. I dont even think their biases influenced their polling results. Yet if you told any of them the morning of the election that you werent sure Hillary would win theyd be totally justified in asking why you dont trust the science or why you thought you were smarter than  of pollsters.This is a totally false analogy in my opinion for three reasons Political polling is a social scientific endeavor subject to all of the foibles and unpredictability that come from the agency of human beings. For just one example people are becoming less and less likely to answer polls much as we were criticizing the study of a given phenomena within climate change or a given studost.comentrypollingwhenpeopledontanswerphonesusbbeebfbde and its very difficult to model whether or not the people answering polls are systematically different than the people not answering them Natural phenomena dont choose to participate or not participate in their systems in impossibletomodel ways. If we grant the premise that the polling was wrong in the  election or the interpretation of the polling by the experts the analogy would only hold up inasmuch as it served as a possible criticism of an individual study or research program within climate science. It would not serve as an effective analogue to critique of the whole field. Much like we wouldnt use one election that had been incorrectly predicted to discredit political polling in general one possibly misinterpreted study or even series of studies on a subset question of climate science shouldnt and from an empirical standpoint couldnt be used to discredit the overwhelming weight of the evidence as it pertains to humancaused climate change We have a lot more than a  elections worth of climate science. Third and most importantly the premise for number  is not accurate. This analogy completely falls apart because the polling wasnt wrong just the talking heads that conveyed the information The actual outcome of the election was well with the margin of error for many individual polls and certainly within the margin or error for poll aggregators it was only the confluence of the unusual nature of Trumps candidacy the late break of the polls towards Trump after a consistent and longheld lead by Clinton and the total lack of accountability among the punditry that lead to improperly confident predictions. Inasmuch as the polls collectively were off it was only by a percentage point or two  it just so happened that those percentage points clustered around a key threshold in a firstpastthepost winnertakeall election. So this analogy would only hold if one of two things were true  the difference between the science being right and science being wrong were both contained within an ex ante unknowable error term this is simply not analogous to natural science or  if pundits were boldly proclaiming that climate change is real or not real either way works while scientists were more mixed. Exactly the opposite is true. There is a huge constituency of the punditry on TV that speak for and against climate change seemingly entirely on the basis of ideology giving the impression the science is similarly mixed while the actual scientists across disciplines time cultures and nations are in for all intents and purposes universal agreement that evidence pointing to humancaused climate change is overwhelming Much of the punditry in media in other words is skeptical of climate science despite there being little reason to be skeptical and is conversely overly trusting of polling even when the polling itself contains statistical mechanisms that caution against its own findings.Finally the notion of being smarter than or not smarter than the scientists or the polls is absolutely not the type of language we should be using when discussing this topic. Just like you wouldnt have bet your life savings on a Trump win on November th given at best his victory was a coin flip ex ante which is borne out by the fact that he didnt win by more than a percentage point or two in pretty much any of the states that swung the election his way the idea that we would bet our species existence on the coinflip possibility were not causing climate change and you would need to find a  sided coin by the way shows in my opinion very poor risk evaluation. The benefits of winning that bet are basically nil and the potential consequences of losing it are obviously catastrophic.,NeutralPolitics,db2zs05,6,t5_2tk0i

9941145,0,t1_db30znm,You saidgt the conclusions they drew were wrongAnd I corrected you. The science said  probability not certainty.gt  bad assumptions can be made that result in incorrect conclusionsYou made the case that you distrust science because they get things wrong and you sited polling as an example. But the science in the polling was correct. Uncertainty in polls exist and thats why they conclude with a probability. Its easy to conclude that the science is wrong but thats not how probabilities work science doesnt predict the future with absolute certainty.So things that you can challenge are precise statements like this year will be hotter than next. Science cant answer that for certain. But it can say that with  probability making this number up this decade will be hotter than the last. Further as we look out onto longer time frames we can increase our certainty. E.g. If we continue on our path of CO production then in  years time we will have  probability that the planet will be  warmer on averageIf you distrust the science then perhaps youd gain an appreciation for it by reading something more in depth than news articles that truncate the message. Give Storms of my Grandchildren a read. It walks you through the science common objections and solutions all while being an accessible read for nonscientists.You might just come away having more trust in the science.

Moreover as far as Ive seen none of the leaked foreign surveillance practices were even remotely a surprise to anyone with a technical backgroundand there are plenty of gangsters and terrorists with technical knowledge. Likewise the surprises for foreign states should have been few and minor.Personally I still disapprove of leaking anything beyond the irresponsible and obviously unconstitutional programsbut I do so out of principle and because it undermined his more important arguments not because it directly caused any significant damage in terms of crime terrorism or legitimate intelligence collection.,NeutralPolitics,dcm9g20,9,t5_2tk0i

When Net Neutrality fails to pass and fails hard these point below are whats going to be considered not some gushygooey sentiment about the internet being a public service.TelephonyIts been acceptable from  to  for communications to be charged with a series of rates and tariffs dependent on geography and time of day. Telephones calls are not charged at a flat rate per call length. The type of transmission affects the price.TheatresFor over  years people have been paying admission for movies. Sitting in the dark and watching a screen is a commodity. You pay for the experience. Most towns in America have only one theatre. These may have multiple screens but there is only one venue. As long as there is an option to choose a specific movie people are happy and dont need the option of going to a different theatre in town.LibrariesYou dont have a right to read. Society puts so much value on education that every child goes to school and learns to read. Reading is a privilege of picking the right place and time to be born.Going further society puts so much value on raw knowledge that public libraries are available to many. But not every citizen has easy access. Having a local library is a privilege of picking the right place to live.Nor does Society have an obligation to put a bookshelf in every home. Internet Access is just a function of libraries now. Nice to have but not a right nor an entitlement.TelevisionThe FCC in America in the s established a set of rules and practices that governed Television standards. It had rules for fair conduct in political matters equal time. It even defined the social content required for the good of the community. The FCC in the s didnt have much room for ghastly movies with Shannon Tweed writhing to a Kenny G soprano saxophone solo that just went on and on and on like cmon just cut to the chase with the titties already.Thirty years ago Cable TV was introduced. The public was willing to pay private companies for content that did not in any way conform to the standards of the FCC. When the FCC tried to bring cable under the umbrella of broadcast both the cable companies and the public rejected it.

Its very common for laws to mirror language of other similarlypurposed laws. In the case of the FADA we have Mississippi House Bill Now this bill is currently enjoined by District Court awaiting appellate review.

My point is that Europe does not have the same history of slavery as the U.S. does. It had colonies but that may not be the same thing.  Once Europe does become concerned with racial issues as with Brexit perhaps it too can become polarized about right  left politics?One danger with citing this as the reason however is that it is tantamount to calling conservatives racists which is itself a polarizing issue.

If he says her language is particular for a reason Im taking his word for it. gtbut its contributing to a continuing narrative that hes making hasty poorly thought out decisions and is now on the defensive about basically all of them. Trump has a habit of trying to act gt react gt distractThis part I fully admit is based on me watching his campaign and media performance. I think its a reasonable assessment of his behavior but frankly citing it sounds overwhelming. I dont really want to spend an entire evening going back through my Trump folder and trying to show how many different times he used that exact tactic.But in general Ill just say this Trump scandals follow this formatTrump says something dumbprovocative or someone finds evidence that Trump once said something dumbprovocative. People get upset that Trump said something dumbprovocative. Trump responds by doubling down on the provocative thing I.E. saying about McCain hes not a war hero I like people who didnt get captured!. People get even more upset about what he said. Meanwhile hes moved on to something new.gtBut still links to some of those scandals you are mentioning would be golden.If you want to enjoy Trump scandals Id suggest googling pussygate McCain war hero Trump Trump Humayun Khan Trump Alzheimers. That should give you a pretty solid crosssection of the Trump is a horrible eeeeevil dictator vs Trump is a gibbering moron vs Trump is a rapey rapist! scandals. All of those were running often at the same time during his campaign. None of them ever managed to solidify into a coherent narrative beyond Trump baaaaaad.gtAnd if something sounds logical if something sounds good enough that it might be true we need to be extra careful before accepting it as truth as we might often be mislead by our own bias.Unfortunately I really dont have much to offer beyond my own logic and personal opinion on the stuff at the end of my post. I do believe it but its more of a hunchpersonal feeling. Ive been trying to sort out why Trump seems to have most of these scandals bounce off and Im increasingly certain its tied to the fact that nobodys been really able to get a Uniform Theory of Trump together.What I mean is  each of his scandals is isolated to some degree. The only real universal criticisms of Trump that have stuck well are like hes dumb but you cant convince his supporters to turn away with hes dumb you need concrete actual shit. And the  concrete actual shit is too spread out.But all of a sudden all the concrete shit is starting to come together into a single package. Instead of  distinct scandals suddenly Trump has one big scandal because people are able to put all his individual fuckups under the umbrella of Hes a hasty impulsive petty tyrant.,NeutralPolitics,dd64qcb,19,t5_2tk0i

10697010,0,t1_ddj6ms4,gtIs there an argument that a revenueneutral tax would actually not hurt the fossil fuel industries because the sales tax decreases would help them in other ways?It absolutely would hurt the fossil fuel industries because it would decrease fossil fuel consumption. That said things are not always as cut and dry as they seem. For instance an increase in carbon costs would accelerate natural gas substitution for coal in power generation which in the short term benefits the oil industry at the expense of the coal industry. In the long term the Republicans just have to convince the fossil fuel industries that this plan will be the less bad for them than whatever a future Democratic administration will bring the Obama EPA is a big help in that regard. That being said you shouldnt roll the dice and hope that a Democratic administration in  years will win and use the EPA to batter the industry again. Though Obama administration was a regulatory and bureaucratic nightmare for the industry its not clear to what extent that actually reduced fossil fuel consumption. Sometimes carbon reductions come from unexpected places just look at the reductions weve gotten from the replacement of coal with natural gas for power generation. Virtually all economists agree that a carbon tax would be a very efficient way to achieve real carbon reductions. ,NeutralPolitics,ddjbf7a,1,t5_2tk0i

See here gtthere have been several international comparisons made placing Sweden at the top end of the number of reported rapes. However police procedures and legal definitions vary widely across countries which makes it difficult to compare rape statistics. For example Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider in  which largely explains a significant increase in the number of reported rapes in the tenyear period of . The Swedish police also record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Additionally the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases in an effort to increase the number of crimes reported. Raised awareness and a shifting attitude of sexual crimes in Swedenwhich has been ranked as the number one country in gender equality may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape.,NeutralPolitics,ddzc37c,13,t5_2tk0i

It could be a bubble or it could be based on real things like improved market confidence and expectations of deregulation and tax cuts. These are all legitimate reasons for a stock market rise.I totally agree that a big factor in the meetings is PR value. Visibility of the presidentadministration taking the economy seriously drives market confidence and results in more investment as seen by surge in stock market. Basically even if the meetings are mostly show they become a self fulfilling prophecy.Unless Obama or Bush were having proactive regular meetings with industry leaders what Trump is doing is unprecedented. And if they were having these types of meetings they werent drawing attention to them like Trump has. So either way what hes doing is unprecedented.Its obviously too early to tell what Trumps legacy will be when it comes to the economy but so far he is objectively doing really well. Keep in mind it hasnt even been two months. Well see what kind of healthcare reform and tax plans they manage to cook up.

Youre making all sorts of assumptions about how education works and how successful a teacher can be in changing a persons habits. Contrary to the impression given in Econ  people very often do not make rational decisions about their finances no matter how much you teach them especially when under pressure. If you want to understand what works and how well you have to look at research on education. Otherwise youre just spitballing.And any change that can be a potential improvement could also fail spectacularly. I dont see why this merits introducing all sorts of extra risk to a system when the purported benefit is just more money.gtIm not a fan of unqualified arguments for the status quo just because something works pretty subjective doesnt mean it cant be improved.Yes but there are some basic thresholds you should meet to demonstrate that you actually have a decent chance of improving the status quo. After all its axiomatic that the status quo works as well as it currently does. Im thinking of the basic questions from high school policy debate Is there a problem with the status quo and is causedpreventable by the government? Are these harms going to be solved by your plan? Is it workable? Will the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and are the disadvantages be mitigated enough to justify the change?Imagining theoretical benefits before getting empirical evidence that such a plan works is an MO that has empirically been demonstrated to lead to disaster an example of which writ large is Bolshevism.

Warranties product guarantees secured financing and a host of other instruments are all subject to a significant nonzero risk  the issuer may default go bankrupt or through bad investing have insufficient funds to pay any judgement. And yet we still call those guarantees. BTW these types of assurances are of the class you are proscribing. So your argument is somewhat confusing.  As for legislators voting against SS I am again confused. Nobody serious that I know of is suggesting that SS is at risk of being legislated out  if thats what you meant by voting against.

Since its public you dont know who coded it and risk them finding a way to track you. For this reason it would be too risky for a STATE to use some anonymously provided hacking tool.

I think that China and Japans Island Disputes might have already erupted into armed conflict over the oil under them if it were not the fact theyre each others first and second largest trading partners. I think they would have already warred repeatedly since WWII if not for the stabilizing presence of the US in maintaining its hegemony in the region.  The US insists that Japan not project military force outside its borders and Japan has no choice but to comply.  China has up to now and most likely for the foreseeable future not been able to challenge US military supremacy and so it doesnt bother trying.

11059888,0,t1_delle46,gt Can you link me some previous EOs that are meant to override existing EOs specifically those that offer clarification to an existing EO without selfreference? I cant seem to find any so if its a perfectly normal thing a source would be nicegt All of my experience points to clarifications coming in memos by various administrative departments not to a new EO.Well I am glad to inform you that this is a very normal action! Always good to ask questions. Here is an example of Obama revoking several other EOs while at the same time amending and modifying a previous one. From just last year! This is very normal and not unusual. I can easily call up a half dozen examples of revokingamending previous EOs with ease if needed all by just Obama in just the last few years. gtWell no  it didnt specify how this EO was different only further explained the now defunct EO.It did though. It clarifiedamended the previous one. It is literally in the language. gtExecutive Order  did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups that priority applied to refugees from every nation including those in which Islam is a minority religion and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities  whoever they are and wherever they reside to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances...gtAgain this new EO goes in place of the previous EO so references to the previous EO without any selfreference are legally useless.Just because the courts struck down the previous EO does not mean that EO does not exist. References to the previous EO are perfectly valid. Especially when clarifying things that separate it from the previous EO that was struck down. Things that will be examined by the courts now. ,NeutralPolitics,delmcdr,2,t5_2tk0i

I want as much competition and invention happening with pharmaceuticals as possible side note  DJT vs FDA will be an interesting one to watch....  MOST people do not need the newest blockbuster drugs  they can get away with the much cheaper older drugs note I am a pharmacist.  Yes the new drugs cost an arm and a leg but who should pay for the therapy where they take out you blood cells genetically engineer them to fight cancer and then put them back into your body?  That is crazy advanced and right now CANNOT be made available to everyone...yet. And so many of the new drugs are VERY different from the drugs of the past they are x as big of molecules.  Thankfully the global market is starting figure out how to codify biosimilars i.e. generics for these new complex drugs.  Hopefully this will cause prices in these industries to drop.gtI dont know how to break this to you gently but uh according to the World Bank and WHO America already has fewer doctors per capita than Australiagt Australia is also already higher than the USA! We have more doctors we pay them more salary OK so you have more doctors and pay them more?  Agree or disagree less Americans would become physicians if the pay was substantially cut.Again my question is HOW DO WE MOVE FROM THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO A MEDICAIDFORALL SYSTEM WITHOUT SKYROCKETING HEALTHCARE COSTS?gtIn what way did your cousin lose benefits by being Canadian instead of American?My point was the American voting public would not accept this as the norm. It would be called rationing.  So if your everyone gets healthcare and it doesnt cost us a dime extra plan involves such rationing it would not be palatable to the American public.  Yes it is easy to ignore the people that dont have insurance at all when you are a single member of society.gtThis feels so much better than paying  tax on my income unnnnfff!Not sure what you are saying here.  The problem is the young generation is being sold a bill of goods.  We are paying for the next generation of retirees but do not expect to get anything in return.  So you take a decent chunk of my money  HA!   alone from my side then my company pays a matching  give it to the elderly but no one will be giving me money when I am elderly.  Who is going to pay for MY healthcare costs while Im on my way out?  Man it sure would have been nice if I could make an extra  throughout my life and plan for my own expenses. Medicare is a pyramid scheme and like all late arrivals in the scheme my generation is going to put in  and get nothing in return.Please please please point me to a study that shows we can move to a universal coverage model without breaking the bank AND not rationing care in the eyes of Americans as this would make the move unacceptable to the public.  It seems to me you are focusing on Americans put the almighty dollar first and telling us that is wrong.  I am trying to see how we get Americans IN THEIR CURRENT STATE with their current beliefs to accept universal healthcare.  What is the path forward for the USA?  ,NeutralPolitics,deo8s7b,1,t5_2tk0i

11179380,0,t1_dez0sqr,And then she appealed it to the supreme Court and won.     Held Title VIIs numerical threshold does not circumscribe federalcourt subjectmatter jurisdiction. Instead the employeenumerosity requirement relates to the substantive adequacy of Arbaughs Title VII claim and therefore could not be raised defensively late in the lawsuit i.e. after YampH had failed to assert the objection prior to the close of trial on the merits. The basic statutory grants of federalcourt subjectmatter jurisdiction are contained in  U. S. C.  which provides for federalquestion jurisdiction and  which provides for diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. A plaintiff properly invokes  jurisdiction when she pleads a colorable claim arising under the Federal Constitution or laws. See Bell v. Hood  U. S.  . She invokes  jurisdiction when she presents a claim between parties of diverse citizenship that exceeds the required jurisdictional amount currently . See a. Arbaugh invoked federalquestion jurisdiction under  but her case arises under a federal law Title VII that specifies as a prerequisite to its application the existence of a particular fact i.e.  or more employees. The Court resolves the question whether that fact is jurisdictional or relates to the merits of a Title VII claim mindful of the consequences of typing the employee threshold a determinant of subjectmatter jurisdiction rather than an element of Arbaughs claim for relief. First subjectmatter jurisdiction because it involves the courts power to hear a case can never be forfeited or waived. United States v. Cotton  U. S.  . Moreover courts including this Court have an independent obligation to determine whether subjectmatter jurisdiction exists even in the absence of a challenge from any party. Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co.  U. S.  . Nothing in Title VIIs text indicates that Congress intended courts on their own motion to assure that the employeenumerosity requirement is met. Second in some instances if subjectmatter jurisdiction turns on contested facts the trial judge may be authorized to review the evidence and resolve the dispute on her own. If satisfaction of an essential element of a claim is at issue however the jury is the proper trier of contested facts. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products Inc.  U. S.  . Third when a federal court concludes that it lacks subjectmatter jurisdiction the complaint must be dismissed in its entirety. Thus the trial court below dismissed along with the Title VII claim pendent statelaw claims fully tried by a jury and determined on the merits. In contrast when a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim the court generally retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to  over pendent statelaw claims.,NeutralPolitics,dez64vz,3,t5_2tk0i

11229261,0,t1_df4qqt5,This article speculates that Mulvaney may have been referring to the Child and Adult Care Food Program CACFP run by the US Department of Agriculture. That program does provide meals and snacks to children in an afterschool setting. The Congressional Budget Office offers more information on the CACFP in this PDFThat being said it is also entirely possible that Trump administration officials are either a confused or b intentionally misleading the public in order to justify cuts to both school meal programs and afterschool programs simultaneously. The evidence for b stems from the fact that Mulvaney himself claims theres no evidence that free meals afterschool school programs or some combination of free meals and afterschool programs work when of course there is a great deal of evidence as this thread has discovered that free meals afterschool programs or some combination of free meals and afterschool programs do work. So Mulvaney is already misleading the public in that respect and since the evidence that these programs work is so easy to find it is likely an intentional attempt to mislead on his part or at least a form of ignorance that borders on incompetence.,NeutralPolitics,df4tlgx,12,t5_2tk0i

11373349,1,t1_dfl493n,You maybe right Google is an unusual business but a business never the less. But if you are then why are people complaining? As long as ISPs whoever they are own the copper wire in the ground or whatever their method is our access to the internet belongs to them. As an example when you rent a car its still not your car. So if the car owner says dont smoke in this car even though you have paid to use the car you still have to accept their rule and not smoke in the car.If we dont like the rules to use their internet? Then we dont have to use their access. Right?,NeutralPolitics,dfl5cse,1,t5_2tk0i

The population of Israel is  Palestinian and those Palestinians are way better off on average being in Israel proper.Is there anything like this in the history of South Africa? No. Of course not.It is much more like a decent state with mild discrimination that also has a very problematic military occupation of former enemy territory that is causing a low key insurgency.I think we should be critical of all the states involved in the region but I dont think we should look at it through apartheid there are other more useful lenses to use.,NeutralPolitics,dfr67mk,11,t5_2tk0i

11473122,0,t1_dfru7jp,Its NOT just a peace of land in the middle east its an entire country that relies on a national religious identity for its own existence. good luck explaining to Jews theyre not special because you cant see Israel from the moon. Thats entirely irrelevant to the situation. Yes in many ways its a two sided coin on the argument over who owns what in the Middle East but that doesnt mean that the Jewish people of the Middle East arent going to fight for their cause and identity. If they dont then theyll undoubtedly face persecution just as Muslims in Israel face discrimination today.

11559098,0,t1_dg555t3,This is actually pretty easy to explain though the media seems to ignore the issue likely because it generates ratings.. Trumps transition team failed to ensure they had all the needed staff positions filled before the inauguration. Many Obama administration staff stayed on to help keep things running until they could replace people. Trumps staff then dragged their feet on hiring new people until the leaks about Russia smacked him. Then he started cleaning house. I believe this process is now almost done but there may be some folks left. . One of Tumps favored decision making moves is to surround himself with people that disagree with each other. This sounds good to get multiple viewpoints but is a double edged sword if members of your cabinet or staff are not happy that their advice is ignored in favor of a opponent. ,NeutralPolitics,dg687xr,44,t5_2tk0i

11750788,0,t1_dgruvii,The point that you were making about how it would be efficient for the government to handle the research is one that I very tentatively support.  Having the government own such copyrights in the name of the American people would and handling it as such would be beneficial.My biggest worry on that front is that these are subjects that span decades.  You absolutely cannot have groups losing political interest in curing a disease midway through.  You cannot have the Democrats spending a great deal of money on research the four years and then the Republicans cutting all funding for four years. This is a problem that we have in the number of governmentfunded agencies.  The feast and famine of government work based on political ideology would be poison.  And as many problems as the market itself has on this front for example so much focus on erectile dysfunction and baldness but less focus on actual diseases the fact of the matter is do we have the attention span necessary.  And I question if politics more specifically the public if it could be convinced by political players that research was wasteful would have the needed attention span.  Given how readily people jump to claims that taxation is theft as the wax and wane of political power allows them to make changes would longstanding research survive?     ,NeutralPolitics,dgrzc52,3,t5_2tk0i
