45294,0,t3_1ulrvy,I still have ibodger on my phone but I use this when building lists with new models not on ibodger. Its a great list building tool though many skorne theme lists cause it to crash.

73494,0,t1_ceme2x9,OP commented that Shae is foreign to him. Being that I love Shae in a manly way and I like talking or writing about Warmachine I figured Id write up a quick primer on the Captain of the Talion...without really talking about Shae himself. When people talk about Shae theyre really talking about Shaes tier listThe foremost reason for this is because Shae can only be played under Talion contract and Shaes tier list lets you take anything in the Talion contract except Dougal McNaille and Bloody Bradigan..given the bonuses you get in tier its silly not to go tier at this point in time. You get  free points pathfinder for stuff on turn  and the big one  to your starting roll.Ive heard a couple times that the  to go first results in actually going first better than  of the time when you account for tie breakers. For this list going first is very important. Synergies ahoy!So now that its clear that when were talking about Shae were not just talking about Shae we can talk about synergy..and most of the synergy in his list doesnt actually come from him..what Shae actually does Id consider is support and I think theres a difference.Its important to note at this time that Press Gangers are a Sea Dog unit. Says so right on their card. So anything that applies to Sea Dogs also applies to Press Gangers. However the solos in the list are not Sea Dogs but Privateers so they dont apply their bonuses to each other. First Lady Hawk. If youre playing against Shae this should probably be the first model you try to kill. She gives Sea Dogs in her command range an extra die on hand weapon attacks vs warrior models which is most of the punch this list has without a Galleon. Lord Rockbottom. Gives Sea Dogs Tough. Part one of the three card combo. Doc Killingsworth. Makes Tough Sea Dogs supertough. Part two of the three card combo. Bosun Grogspar. Sea Dogs cant be knocked down applies to tough checks. Part three of the three card combo. Dirty Meg. Doesnt actually do anything for Sea Dogs..if anything isnt going to be included in A Pirates Life its her. A single weapon attachment for the Sea Dog unit is a viable alternative. However she can repair so she has some use when you bring the Galleon at . Press Gangers. When Press Gangers kill an enemy warrior model under the right conditions they can add a Sea Dog to a nearby unit of them. Its awesome. Boarding ActionsSo now that you know what all the pieces do how do they fit together? Well for starters with Mr. Walls the Sea Dog UA the Sea Dogs have Advance Deploy and Press Gangers natively have it and Tough. So assuming youre going first they deploy  out.Turn one everything runs. Even the Commodore Cannon moves up. Youre now  across the board. If youre bad at math that means youve crossed the halfway line. Unless your opponent is fielding a lot of AD or movement shenanigans themselves you shouldnt be in their threat range but if you are you probably should not get that far up.Turn two Shae pops his feat and if necessary casts Coup de Main and youre charging into your opponent. Most of your solos will probably just run to keep up but with Mr. Walls minifeat the Sea Dogs have a  threat range and the Press Gangers have .So again if youre bad at math by turn two your units can have moved  across the board and are into your opponents deployment zone.Now that wont actually happen..but the goal here is really what you can do with the advantage you get from the first turn. Youre halfway across the board and your opponent knows there is no  real option for them to not get charged. They can move up and take the charge or they can try to back up but theres no good answer unless theyre playing jackbeast heavy then youre in trouble andor have lost.If things go badly and you dont have the option to charge you can still get the Sea Dogs  up by running and just engage hope supertough saves you for a turn and hold them down. Press Gangers will move  under the same circumstances.If they do back up or try to not get charged in some way you pretty much win by scenario because youve taken the fight three quarters of the way across the board. If they take the charge you still have good odds of winning by scenario even if you dont have the punch to clear stuff out quickly. Even if things go badly RockbottomDocGrogspar give you a  dude tarpit almost as good as Boomhowlers..and the Press Gangers bring your dead guys back! Thar ye beThis is just a beginner to intermediates guide to Shae..he does other neat stuff..if you can save his feat you can get your units into opponents backfields and just wreak havoc Phantasm is great for that and he even does a decent job of finishing a game on his own but I wouldnt recommend it. And at  hes fielding a Galleon which helps a lot with high armor stuff.I didnt really cover the Commodore Cannon or Aiyanna amp Holt..what they do really works independently of the list or is static regardless of lists..but I hope that helps.Edit Formatting.,Warmachine,cemsomr,2,t5_2s3ta

189970,0,t3_1wa4ci,Molik a Krea and a Tyrant commander for Hyperion is a fair trade though. Youve risked about  points to consume nearly an identical number of points. I think your bigger issue is figuring out how to do this without risking the Fury generation of your caster and giving up a primary assassination tool Molik. Alternatives to this solution such as the Bronzeback have a similar risk.To avoid that risk Arcuarii and Cetrati fit the bill nicely. Medium bases to avoid effects like consume and hit points with ARM to mitigate blast damage or autohitting damage. They also force the gargossals to burn lots of ffuryfocus consuming a lesser number of threatening models. Pair them Xerxis or another caster with a damage buff or ARM debuff and you wont have any issues at all. ,Warmachine,cf02sjg,4,t5_2s3ta

You have initial attacks all your melee attacks in this case that you can make during your combat action unless you used a special attack which will take the place of all your initial attacks.

If you like Trolls play Trolls because they work just fine. The three things that might speak against Trolls would be they are read can be played as the ranged faction in Hordes which slightly mirror Cygnar they somewhat require  points to play optimal lists due to their relative large support staff and being mostly medium bases they can be very expensive to buy. If the points above arent greatly detrimental to you liking them go ahead and play some Trolls. ,Warmachine,chntjxy,1,t5_2s3ta

1104861,0,t3_26roz5,A quick tip about varnishing from the folks at Golden Artist Colors.gtAnother consideration is the ambient conditions of the work area. Ideally the temperature should be above  F and below  F while the relative humidity is between  and . Excessive humidity or cool temperature may result in bloom a whiteness or opacity resulting from moisture trapped between the varnish and paint layers. If the surface of the piece being varnished is warmer than the varnish applied the varnish will become thinner in viscosity upon application. This may result in unexpected dripping or sagging particularly if working vertically. Likewise if the varnish and surface are relatively cool but warm significantly shortly after application the varnish may drip or sag. Prewarming the varnish in a warm water bath can help prevent this.Also to answer your question. It really depends on your painting. If you dont do things like highlights and dry brushing then no you dont need to varnish if you know you wont drop a model. But the act of moving models putting them in and taking them out of foam can cause the top layers of paint to be slowly eroded away. ,Warmachine,chtvo6f,2,t5_2s3ta

1346399,0,t3_29gj32,gtcustomizing my army and creating some fluff..I asked the same question or at least a similar question when I came here.  I love building customized miniatures and I really enjoyed having lore for my own marines in that other game back when i played it.A large part of warmachine is its characters be it the warcaster leading your army or the solos single dudes that may or may not wreck face that join the fray.  These characters already have their own lore associated with them and there is no way to really make your own warcasterarmy leader lore wise outside of maybe customizing the cygnar journeyman for fun but its still not the true leader.  So generally customizing those a lot isnt something you can do.However for the hobbiest and lore junkies who want their own special snowflakes this is totally me.. each unit has its own unit leader and sometimes non character solo models that you can realistically customize and give some fluff too.  Why is Bob the troop commander following ltInsert your favorite carnage obsessed warcaster heregt.  There are still conversion rules but iv found that I have more than enough leeway in doing little things like this to keep the part of me that likes making my own bits of fluff happy.Now that said for customization in army building?  There are no upgrade X dude to have Y for Z points in warmachine Save for the only example I can think of the ManOWar Drakhun Dismount.  The model you get is the model you get.  So there wont be devastator rocket squads compared to las squads or devilgaunts or anything like that.  In terms of painting.. well.. since you have Khador this link is appropriate.  Each of the little stick dudes represents a different colour scheme someone has painted their Khador.  You can look through different posts to see a wide variety of different colours people painted their dudes who are in lore normally exclusively red.  People even painted them blue! Heresy of the highest order in Khador  BLUE!   The TLDR here.. because i ramble is that you can paint what you want however you want and no one has any right to call you on it.  Unless you paint Khador blue.  In which case you can expect a friendly ribbing from every other Khador player who hates Cygnar.,Warmachine,cil33js,3,t5_2s3ta

1509528,0,t3_2bhypk,The problem with Minions isnt their agewe have multiple factions that are as new or newer that see more playbut the fact that theyre designed like Mercs are rather than like any other faction. A significant portion of their releases are designed as much to fill gaps and provide new options to the other Hordes and occasionally Warmachine factions. That combined with the no model sharing contracts means that Minion development seems very very slow.This means that not only do they have very little available to them but that any changes to that will come slowly. This is the real problem youre going to face if you play Blindwater and want to be competitive. Youre going to be running  max units of Gatorman Posse in every list. The only exception to this is the Barnabas theme force where youll take even more units of Posse.And the part that I find really turns insult to injury is that you wont have the best faction for Posse. Nothing any Gator caster can do will make them nearly as good as they are in Skorne.If neither of those facts bother you theyre fine. Everything in that Maelok box seems fine. All essential stuff. Id personally rather play Rask because he turns a lot of things in Blindwater up to  but thats just me.So yeah if you dont think youre going to get bored playing the same sort of thing over and over and you arent too worried that your answer to basically every question is Gatorman Posse theyre fine.,Warmachine,cj5htq1,7,t5_2s3ta

Privateer Press has always done a good job of making the barrels noticeable without the need of drilling.

2361525,0,t1_cm3gmgs,Again thanks for the comment MobiusFaiz.  I think I roll with the punches pretty well.  Even with the go kill yourself comment.People complained about me spamming videos.  So I backed way off.  Posting one every two weeks if it was a Party Foul original.  I have posted some WTC videos but we have no tie to that.  So I dont think those would qualify as spam. But again new to Reddit so correct me if I am wrong. Youve managed to do this primarily through your attitude of criticism and also by overdosing the subreddit with content.I was new to reddit when I was posting  videos a week.  Never daily.  And that was about  months ago.  And I still get flak for it.  Which is cool. I get it.  Reddit is all new to me.  So their will be a learning curve.  Hell I just learned how to flair my post.  As for my attitude.  Well yes I have one.  Everyone does.  I am sure some posts come of with more attitude then is intended but thats the fault of the medium.  There is no emotion in a message.  Its whatever you take out of it.With the internet you reach a wide audience.  And I know they cant all be pleased.  Some people like something we do and compliment us.  And at the same time someone will rip us apart for that same video.  Honestly all the hostility we get is here on Reddit.  Im not sure why.  But I know this and accept it.  And it gives us some great conversations at the hobby store we hang out at.  I have even had complete strangers come up to me at Warmachine events and ask me why the reddit community hates us so much.  I really had no answer for them.So I hope you dont think this is me replying negatively.   I really do appreciate any comments that anyone has.  Any suggestions to improve is always welcome.

2577325,0,t3_2pb1bj,It... should be working on its own. Use the Mitigator to KD their heavy beastjack with one focus then it can die because its done its job. Give  focus to the Cipher and  to the Galvanizer bouncing focus to the Galv where possible and charge the heavy and murder it. Once their heavy is dead most boxes are pretty much finished. The general strategy to use is to abuse Focus Induction your primary interesting mechanic for Convergence. This allows you to bounce focus to a nearby friendly faction warjack within  inches once a turn per model. So your first turn is spent with  on Syntherion and  on one of your warjacks. Warjacks go first Run bounce to the next warjack Run bounce to the next warjack etc. Synth walks up drops Reconstruct on the Cipher and casts Synergy on himself. Then you get to the crushing on the next turn using your Mitigator to KD their heavy the Cipher charging in then the Galvanizer charging in. If you want you can Feat for a free chargeWeapons Platform on everyone that turn which allows the Cipher to drop a Flare at its target if you missed the KD. Without a heavy and assuming you havent opened an assassination run on Synth you should win pretty easily.,Warmachine,cmuztaz,2,t5_2s3ta

2766852,0,t3_2rrelu,Im in the same boat the only thing stopping me right now is that Ive put some  into my collection.  It feels to me that Khador can only do single wound infantry well while everyone else can have good single wound infantry with buffs Defenders WardArcane Shield is worlds better than Iron Flesh for no drawback at all and it can be used on Warjacks too as well as run light and heavy Warjacks and often multiwound infantry too.  Beyond something like Black Dragon Pikemen Khadors infantry can get destroyed in the blink of an eye since the armor usually sucks.I wish I could convince you otherwise but Im feeling the same way and strongly considering Cygnar or Menoth as something that plays closer to how I want well I just like Cygnar because it was what first appealed to me when I wanted to play.  Also blue is my favorite color and I like lightning.  Menoth in particular get good infantry lots of buffs can run multiple Warjacks have some of the best casters in the game and get multiwound infantry that put our MoW troops to shame.  Khador gets what  more points of armor and  boxes which in my experience doesnt matter a lot.  Id trade it in a heartbeat for SPD  or RAT higher than  but casters that generally cant buff our jacks little or no support in faction and terrible to adequate multiwound infantry.For me though I think the worst part is that despite how awesome Butcher is hes put out as the solution to everything.  Butcher is basically presented as the solution to everything wrong with Khador.The faction feels really stale and outdated to me right now.,Warmachine,cnikwq0,1,t5_2s3ta

2841031,0,t3_2sn0uv,Cryx is a very infantry heavy faction. Youll want to put some investment into a unit of bane thralls and their unit attachment and a unit of bane knights. Youll get a lot of mileage out of them and make it into many lists. Youll also want a skarlock thrall warcaster attachment because it allows more mileage out of Dennys awesome spell list. Warwitch Sirens are very versatile and I would recommend picking up two of them.  Eventually youll want to drop the slayer. If the harrower works for you by all mean keep it but most Denny lists are ish arc nodes skarlock thrall and units to bash face in.As for beginning painting invest in quickshade. Youll basically just put down a basecoat of your colors put on some highlights throw quickshade on top of everything to bring out shadows and then a matte coat on top to remove shine and then final touches like glowing eyes.

2868103,0,t3_2sykm5,I dont have much experience running Strakhov or Kommados but it seems like youve got the bases covered.  Spriggans are great targets for Superiority.  Unfortunately you wont get much if any traction with Overrun with this battlegroup without getting Strakhov right in the middle of combat and potentially in the middle of some Doom Reavers.Youve got a collection of decent targets for Occultation.  Add it to the kommandos for some decent staying power when holding an objective give it to Strakhov if you are going to be playing him really aggressive and up the field or give it to the Widowmakers to really keep them out of harms way.The beautiful thing about Widowmakers is their ability to mop up a messy situation with little difficulty.  With this list dont forget how easy it is to peg your own models from the rear with an Aimed Sniper Shot.  I say this because youd be really surprised how much fun it is to pop your own flamethrowers after theyve moved into a good position and presprayed.  I guess you could also use them to do a little prep work for maximizing your Doom Reaver berserker targets as well.Youre going to have some pretty fair cloud coverage with this army.  This will cover a unit of Doom Reavers but the other might be lacking in staying power.  I think Id drop the Manhunter for a Greylord Escort.

Striker Sylas Wishnailer Ironclad Reinholdt Rupert CarvoloFull Trenchers  UANyss Hunters  MurdochB ptsTrenchers AD and Cautious Advance throwing up Clouds.  They block LOS to the rest of my army and are now Def  Arm .  With Rupert they can be Def  Terror or Def  FearlessTough.Depending on the threat in question I can upkeep either  ARM  with Feat for true WTF or  DEF from Striker on them to make them even more Tarpitty.  Def  Terror from Shooting w Blur up isnt anything to sneeze at.The trenchers can shoot stuff I guess but thats not really why theyre there...Nyss Hunters amp B can both shoot right through all of the Trenchers Clouds and B can strip shit like Stealth from key models looking at you Gorman.If the opponent opts for melee once they make it through Terror highly likely and Def ish the Nyss Hunters can Assault into the foe thanks Murdoch! and eff shit up.Honestly the model Im least excited about is the Ironclad who can still be a Knockdown machine.

Trolls are more direct and aggressive than Menoth usually is they tend to buff and then either charge or just survive anything your opponent throws at them. You can run a lot of troll warbeasts or do a number of trollkin troopers though as I understand it troopers are doing somewhat better at the moment look for lists called MMM or Miserable Meat Mountain.Skorne is pretty straightforward and hardhitting as well. They have excellent titan warbeasts that can charge in and kill just about anything particularly the Bronzeback and Gladiator. They also run troops pretty well particularly Xerxes. They have some buffs but they dont stack together as well as Troll or Menite buffs do.Legion mostly focuses on beasts although they have some good Nyss units. But theyre not the focus and theyre not all that straightforward. As a faction theyre glass cannons relying on getting the first strike and hitting hard enough that your opponent cant effectively counterattack.Circle is very much the tricksy Hordes faction and focuses on hitandrun tactics.,Warmachine,coyd2db,3,t5_2s3ta

3465535,0,t3_2zxwb3,If youre just getting into the game I would advise strongly against playing a Theme force of any kind.What you want first is a solid consistent entrypoint to help you become acquainted with the game.While starting off with a Theme force might be appealing at first learning the game while simultaneously trying to learn how to operate your Theme army to acceptable levels will put way too much stress on you as a new player.Id recommend the Battlebox or AllinOne Circle force as your primary jumpingoff point for Circle. Both are great tools for learning.After either of those I would first begin choosing your next Warlock based on which one you believe to fit your perceived playstyle the most as this will help you enjoy the caster more and perform better more quickly with them.The Circle AllinOne begins with Kromac a very inyourface type of Warlock. He plays very aggressively and is not too shabby either. The battlebox starts you off with Kaya whos a onetrick pony. While this makes her fairly weak and predictable in actual larger games it makes her extremely easy to learn with.From either of those points I would move to the next one looking at what you feel like would fit you the best.Bradigus and both versions of Baldur are fairly straightforward in a large number of their applications but offer a lot of subtleties to how you can play them as you progress in army size and skill. If you like the playstyle of Kaya or Kromac you can follow the same Vein with eKaya Grayle or Cassius. Theyre your other Circle Warlocks that fit in the same or similar archetypes.Of course these are just suggestions but Id still advise strongly against building a single theme list as your entry into the game.Id be happy to answer any other questions you have as well and welcome to Warmachine amp Hordes!,Warmachine,cpnanus,4,t5_2s3ta

3528623,0,t3_30owa5,Id say cut the mauler for a max warders. Your list is lacking a buffer and there is no better meat shield than a line of warders and the ksb. At this point youll have  points to spend. You might be saying that you want another beast at this point and Calandra can make it work but Id argue that you have enough beef for  points. For  points Id suggest either a min unit of champssorcerer or the new fire eaters fell caller.  Calamdras feat gets better the more damage dice you have. With both of these suggestions you end up with lots of dice.Champs and sorcerer bring you  pow  weapon masters who roll  damage dice each on a charge and follow it up with a second attack . They also have high armor when btb with each other and really benefit from the ksb. The sorcerer gets adjunct with your warders but is really just there for his magic attack for  point. The fire eaters are a neat mini unit. If you can light them on fire they get boosted atk and dmg rolls. They get  armor vs fire damage and have assault and pow   sprays which cause continuous fire. Youd get  dmg dice on anything you hit with your sprays and  more on the charge. Sprays ignore cover concealment and stealth. The fire eaters are not as good as the champs but they are cheaper leaving you with  points to pick up a fellcaller who at this point doesnt need an explanation but Ill do it anyway. He gives  mat to a unit or pathfinder or can make that unit stand up from knockdown during his activation. Slow warders hitting rough terrain soon? Dont care. Digmies cant hit shit? Now they can. Not to mention the dude himself is a weaponmaster with  atks. This option is not as simple as the champs but it offers a lot of utility that I think your list needs and will allow for more hit connections leading to more dice. Both options offer tons of damage dice its just a matter on how comfortable you are with setting your own firebreathers on fire. Just be careful. If you warp combat warding on the ksb before you set the fbs on fire they lose their advantage. ,Warmachine,cpuhju0,2,t5_2s3ta

Easiest would just be to assume you dont know how to play and start from the beginning because the similarities could mess you up. The most noticeable change is point costs. First warcasters cost nothing and in fact give you points you can spend on jacks in their battlegroup. They divided all point costs by like  ish. You can expect to see a lot of models with single digit point costs. Also the army size has dropped. A tournament size game is now  or  points.

3777147,0,t1_cqmt48l,Feora has a warjack bond.  What this allows her to do is bond one of her noncharacter warjacks in her battlegroup to herself.  This does two things it allows her to allocate it an extra focus and it gives all of those warjacks attacks the Fire continuous effect on all targets hit.  This means that everything under the AOE when the Redeemer or Judicator attack gets set on fire.  The Redeemer has ROF  meaning it can shoot off three attacks in a turn four with the Vassals ancillary attack.  This makes it a PHENOMENAL if focus hungry infantry clearing tool.  It also spreads more fire to make her feat even stronger.  The Judicator is arguably the stronger choice as it pumps out four AOEs a turn without any focus input but it is a colossal and is therefore very expensive.,Warmachine,cqmtmh7,1,t5_2s3ta

Its with an of the day pattern so it happens enough that flexibility is a good thing.I think for general regular discussion the themes work well.  I think going in to little used models can be good...its just that the base jacks that dont get used much that we were discussing dont get used because there often isnt much to talk about  theyre fairly vanilla in a game where people try to use and abuse special rules.I would echo kintexus comment on the character jacks.

3947573,0,t3_35o7z4,Thats a pretty decent start youve got. And the name of the unit I think you mistook for Soul Harvesters is actually Soulhunters. Heres a short but comprehensive list of key models youll want to pick up based on what you have already in descending order starting with your highest priority Skarlock Played in . of cryx armies. Its too good to not play. It slings your casters spells and takes a massive load off their focus pool. Deathjack The best jack Cryx has access to. It can heal itself its focus efficient it has the highest damage output of any single nonwarcasterwarlock model in the game and it can cast spells. Its also Cryxs heaviest and hardest to kill Helljack. Its not a mustplay model like the Skarlock but its a very frequently played model and for good reason. One of Satyxis Raiders  UA Satyxis Blood Witches  UA or Bane Knights Bane Knights are a great attrition and flanking unit Raiders are another tarpit and armor cracking unit but are much faster and better at plugging holes and using their mobility rather than sitting in one place for most of the game like the Bane Thralls will. The Blood Witches are another high damage outputsurvivable unit that has some fantastic utility. These are our  best infantry units. Warwitch Siren  of them would be best. Warwitch Sirens are one of Cryxs best support models. They hand out focus to jacks have a great spray spell and can lock down models without reach. They can also Seduce enemy warrior models but it should almost never be a relevant ability. Gorman di Wulfe One of the best models in the entire game. Gorman is another model thats played heavily in Cryx because he offers some arguably toostrong abilities to your army. He has a AoE  attack that hits everything with an automatic POW  and he can seriously debuff other models with Black Oil or Rust Bomb. Bile Thralls Another staple unit of Cryx. While they arent played in every list theyre still one unit you always want to have on hand. If you can find an old box of them that only has the minimum unit thats going to be the best deal as youre almost never going to play a full unit of Bile Thralls. After all it only takes a single Bile Thrall to kill an entire infantry unit and some solos. The other two units of the  above. Bane Knights Raiders Witches  whichever two you didnt get when you picked one. Darragh Wrathe Adds survivability and mobility to your undead models as well as provides a fantastic passive benefit to your Soulhunter cavalry. Mechanithralls  Necrosurgeon Our best tarpit. What they severely lack in combat prowess they make up for in its entirety in how much of a pain in the ass it can be to kill the unit and keep them dead. Its hard to keep this unit down use them as a cheap tarpit to halt your opponents advance but dont expect them to carry your combat. Blackbanes Ghost Raiders Highly mobile Incorporeal unit thats insanely good at bogging down opposing units that dont have Magic Weapons or some way to attack an Incorporeal model. They either sit there and think about their poor life choices or they move away from a Ghost Raider and take a free strike that automatically causes Fire. Withershadow Combine Strong albeit expensive support unit that can fit with almost all of our casters. Free upkeeps dice rerolling and spellslinging makes them a solid support unit.Hope this helps!

Ive played multiple games with both and taking info from other players as well its easy to see the Corruptor and Desecrator are our two worst jacks.If I were to give ranks to our helljackscolossals this is probably what my list would look like right now as of the current state of the overall meta and released models. Deathjack. Kraken. Inflictor. Nightmare. Leviathan. Harrower. Erebus. Reaper. Malice. Seether. Slayer. Desecrator. CorruptorEven though the Inflictor model hasnt been released its easy to see why it would be one of our best jacks. Its something Cryx has desperately needed for years. Ive been playing with a modified Seether model that has a puttied claw and a modded Reaper Helldriver arm. I used the Cankerworms armor plates as a point of reference for sculpting as well as the art to get that overlapping feel for the Inflictors arm.Were also still waiting on the stats of the Sepulcher and our brand new character Seether whos nicknamed Shovel Hands. If Shovel Hands is good I can see him replacing Nightmare on the board and pushing Nightmare down. The Sepulcher might take our  slot and push everything below it down a rank.

Like pretty much anything good Skorne gets these guys are silly expensive ameliorated somewhat by the fist of halaak list. Theyre pretty squishy when compared to Cetrati and dont hit as hard in melee. The big thing that makes these guys worth taking over more cetrati is utility. CRA lets them hit some key hi DEF models drag is great for clearing charge lanes and breaking up shield walls and while not as amazing as cetrati they certainly still pack a punch in melee. I end up using them a lot to get attachments out of formation and dead super helpful vs. trolls and khador less so vs other stuff.

4071433,0,t3_376gih,Some additional earthtone highlights would definitely make him stand out but its a solid job nonetheless. The rope could also use some touches of highlights to break their shape away from the wood. As for the stone some very light drybrushing of  shades of grays lighter than the one you currently have layered where the light would reflect brightest would do the model wonders. Dont leave the lightings work to be done by the real worlds sun or lights of your game store. It looks like you went a bit too heavy on the OSL around the Woldwardens eyesface as well.Remember OSL is a finesse technique you cant really just throw a light drybrush of color around a glow source and have it look niceneat. Keep the OSL around the Woldwardens eyes and try to avoid the center of his face. A subtle glow from his eyes wouldnt highlight that area of his face normally so dont paint it like it would it throws off the model. With OSL from eyes keep it limited to barely expanding past the models eye sockets. Having a bright OSL highlight on the rim of the eye socket then the faint OSL just barely beyond that down the cheek would give you a better look. You want the source of the glow and sharp edges closest to that light source to be the brightest parts of your OSL not the castoff glow itself.My final bit of critique would be the base. While its a nice start for a rock formation that has that rough of a texture the whole shape of the rock is a little too round. Shaving off the top of the formation to a flatflatish surface would have made it look tons better and would have given the feel of true stone.All said and done your choices of color were correct here the levels of color just need to be developed more.,Warmachine,crkdcne,1,t5_2s3ta

Not count for tough.If you dont have access to a good bit of long range shooting then you have to win on control. Doomies have an  threat range. With Spell ward there are not many ways to speed them up. You have to stay out of their range or bait them into yours.  Baiting is going to be easier for most factions. They are  models for  points. Throw a few disposable guys from a cost  man unit up field to get charged. Then the rest of that unit charges the doomies and kills them.

4662674,0,t3_3etkbu,I read usteeldracos post and Id say a few different things. I am the opposite Im a Trollbloods player who has never played Khador but have played against it quite a bit. Trollbloods have one of the more combined arms styles on the hordes side. We dont have a long ranged game almost all of our ranged shots top out at range  which is definitely short. We do however have a pretty good ranged game in the  range. We definitely have melee covered though. From Khador what I usually see in the ranged department is the socalled Winterguard Death Star which has a lot of sprays a few ranged aoes and some strong boosting options via a solo. I also see widowmakers elite sniping unit and very inaccurate guns on jacks. The thing is though that the Death Star is very ubiquitous almost every khador player will use it because it is very strong and versatile and wellcosted. So you see Khadors shooting a lot.Trolls on the other hand often have shooting as more of a matchup fixer than a core army strength. When it comes to removing tons of infantry that threatens us we usually build special lists to do that. We run our guns with a much smaller percentage of our casters than Khador does for example. However in terms of that shorter range of guns we actually have amassed quite a few good ones. We have scattergunners who only have RAT  but their guns are all sprays like the winterguard but with their unit attachment they dont hit friendly models. This is key. Scattergunners are very good as a second line unit to free up engaged units or even as a frontline unit separated into two rows. Removing friendly fire is great. We also have a newer small unit fire eaters who have very strong assault sprays that light enemies on fire. They have a  threat range at the farthest part of their spray. Sure they are made of paper but they hurt really bad. We also have the Dire Troll Bomber a beast with two potential boostable POW  AoEs. Still range  but  using an animus but thats quite high POW. Also our elemental light trolls have boostable range  attacks.So really trolls definitely can run a mixed arms list pretty well they just arent as factiondefining as the Winterguard Death Star and Widowmakers tend to be. Trollbloods can definitely brick better than a lot of factions. We have the ability to bring a lot of high armor and multiwound weaponmaster infantry andor we can run lists with  heavies and some lights that are all sitting around ARM  most of the game. We can definitely run more flanky or spreadout type lists with some of our casters namely Jarl pGrissel and eMadrak for the most part. Our cavalry longriders are often considered the best in the game and when played well they really sing. The main challenge is that like all cavalry they are expensive so small mistakes can lose you a lot of points. We have a very fast frontline unit Fennbladesthat can spread way out due to its reach medium bases and large CMD area with the UA. That said Khador does tend to spread out more IME just because they dont have auras to worry about and their small bases give them more breathing room. They do. I would say that the main thing about Trollbloods is that we are a faction that operates strongly on the synergy between our various support models and warbeasts when mixed with our infantry or heavy hitting beasts. Consequently our casters are often a less vital role in building the list. Sure some casters run certain things better but largely for any type of list I can point you to  other casters that can run the identical list similarly well just minus one caster benefit but plus another. The army minus the caster is where the strength lies.Khador has some interunit synergies but more often they are based around their casters providing them strong buffs. Khador has quite a few very powerful infantryboosting spells on most of their casters lists and in the cases where they dont have those spells the caster is a force unto themselves. As usteeldraco said Khador typically only runs one jack and a lot of infantry. Trolls can reasonably run anything from one heavy warbeast  lots of infantry to lots of small warbeasts  no infantry to a mix of a couple heavies  lights  a unit of infantry. We are more flexible in listbuilding in that regard.Also he is correct that we have some very strong Tier lists. Calandras Elemental Evolutionism and Doomshapers Runes of War are very strong and competitive though the other list he spoke of with the warders is colloquially called the Miserable Meat Mountain and it is not a tier list. We can also run well out of tier. They both have their difficulties. Khador has tons of small models compared to us so if you struggle with brush control that may be more difficult. Trollbloods often have very mishmash outfits with many layers of leather cloth metal and sometimes stone. While I visually love my trolls I get really tired of parsing through what each of these multilayered materials is supposed to be. However I think our models look cooler so YMMV.,Warmachine,ctiaawb,2,t5_2s3ta

When everyone is new theres a real sense of ugh this game is unbalanced! that only goes away with time and experience helping them see oh!

A beast must be in the warlocks control area to force.Beasts tend to be  more points with lower stats than Warjacks to offset the innate fury pool and animus.Warmachine infantry tends to be better overall allowing warmachine factions to rely less on Warjacks. Mercenary solos are more numerous and potent than the Hordes counterparts e.g. Thrullg vs Eiryss Piper vs Witch Doc etc....Warmachine Warcasters tend to be more powerful than Hordes Warlocks though not always Circle Warlocks are probably more potent than Ret Warcasters.A camping Warcaster can be mathematically invulnerable.

5825961,0,t3_3v0k7h,Convergence adds some extra rules and is not ideal for new players but that doesnt mean its impossible. Warmachine has a pretty steep learning curve and playing a faction like CoC makes it more of a learning cliff. If hes still learning play with  heavy  lights and a unit. Whatever that point value is you make a list at that value. It should be in the  point area. Stay there until he really gets the hang of the basic rules and induction. It may take a halfdozen or more games. Thats fine. Mix up which heavy and unit to keep things interesting. Dont necessarily go easy on him but remember that the purpose here is for him to learn the rules and the competitive part is not as important. This also really depends on  your teaching style and his personality. Convergence can be a very powerful faction but only if the player can capitalize on their special rules. Ive watched experienced players cost themselves games from forgetting the induction rule. Once hes mastered that and the rest of the basic rules then you can start playing large games and expanding. One thing in terms of purchases would be to get a Corollary. Its a light jack that acts more like the warcaster attachments in other factions.  Its not that useful in lowpoint games but nearly necessary for higherpoint ones. ,Warmachine,cxjb4oh,2,t5_2s3ta

The biggest problem with waders and errata is that assuming no numbers are touched on the card taking any one of the rules that are on their  card off severely hurts them reach wm battledriven am I missing any besides toughfearless?. For cinerators unless they got reach or some other monumental buff I wouldnt put them on the table unless they were obscenely undercosted. Man o war melee are probably a point reduction or advance move away from good.  For theme forces I think that the rumored changes to terrain placement in sr take care of it being an outlier if it is one. eVayl needs to have more choices or take a hit to a benefit  spd to nonflying beasts instead maybe?.

People never took them without the stone so its really hard to argue that they were undercosted when the warlocks taking them are effectively starting off at  points. The argument people should have been making was that Champs were grossly overcosted or that Champs and Warders should have switched dline and battledriven. At a  point package for stuff that has to clump up and die to infantry charges anyway its no surprise that people didnt want to run them  even if Warders had been  points theyd still have outclassed Champs.Champs should have been a  unit with a  point UA with their current abilities or keep them  with a  point UA if they had BD instead of dline.

7242386,0,t1_d20zmkm,The lists that remove FA are supposed to be meant for players that really like that units models. IE they dont want rules stopping a hobbyist from having a horde of their favorite game model when it wouldnt really be broken compared to what the faction could already do.  Doom reavers for example the first half of the doom reavers do nothing but die to shooting so thy dont really need to be doom reavers its just for flavor purposes.  That frontline could easily be cheap winterguard and woodsmen with two doom reaver units and IFP in the back and be about as strong and have better models per point ration.  The only difference is needing to force the opponent to focus on chaff.The problem with the strong lists were that the restrictions didnt justify the power increase.  After the change EE requiring a MK justified the increase because two heavies are better than one mountain king so an extra few points isnt a big deal.  I do think there are issues with current theme lists but I do think there is a place for them as purely thematic options that give a small bonus to justify the lack of ideal combinations of power units.  If a theme list is thematic but you would take that combination of models anyway then it doesnt justify getting a bonus.,Warmachine,d21eni2,1,t5_2s3ta

7321635,0,t3_4fnnk0,I sort of disagree. Its not missing much if anything. Youve got a clean paintjob with strong colors and contrasts. Its entirely fine and looks great. There are two things that I would consider optional sidegrades The model is very clean as in dude is factorynew and still smells like brandnew car. One thing you could do is mess him up a bit and add wear and tear. However if youve never worked with weathering techniques and materials such as pigments dont try it on your colossal. It is very easy to really mess your model up or overdo the effect. Here is an example of an army that painted featuring mild to heavy weathering.  It can add a certain something to the overall look but it should be done neatly and coherently! Youve got the purple and youve got the bright green might as well go all the way and add the yellow! Joking aside purple  green  yellow is a fantastic contrast Ive used it for my own stuff as well! Heres a suggestion for sneaking in some tiny bits of yellow You do your green highlights by adding white which is fine and looks great. Its also possible to highlight green by adding yellow eventually ending in pure yellow. Here  are examples of how this can look in practice.  BUT Considering that theres already gold in there you actually might add to much color. Im not sure. In any case it looks fine without adding anything. ,Warmachine,d2af44s,3,t5_2s3ta

7539729,1,t1_d2z3ksh,gt free  Def isnt too bad.Its not free. You paid  points for a model that has this special ability. And if you use that focus to run which you will be doing on turn  you lose the DEF boost from the focus that you spent.Phantasmal Field was a bad ability in mk and its a bad ability in mk. Without the ability to gain some sort of focus efficiency its a really awful dump for focus on a model that your opponent most likely wont be shooting at.You should be able to store focus focus battery or gain the defense bonus based on focus that you start the turn with  and it should work on melee. The way it is the stat line is basically blank.Spend a focus this model gains  DEF against rangedmagic attacks until your next turn. Do you think that this is an effective use of focus? Maybe on a model that was worth shooting  for example if it had its own ranged attack! Maybe if you could use that focus on top of just letting it sit there and go to waste!Phantasmal Field is total shit.,Warmachine,d2z8bc5,-3,t5_2s3ta

7734012,0,t3_4l7ry2,Well done taking the plunge! Ill split this up into positives amp negativesThe bad first  The paint is fairly thick. You cant fix thick paint with a wash the only way to fix thick paint is to strip and start over Im definitely not saying you should strip it! Its just important to know. You could however definitely improve this mini by cleaning up the lines amp washing it. You lose a lot of brush control with thick paint youll get much cleaner lines with thinned paint. You dont need anything special just a few drops of water will do. You dont even need to thin it that much just thin enough that you cant see brush strokes in it will do. Youre not painting display quality yet!.The good  Once you have your paints thinned for your next mini its going to look fantastic. You clearly know how to paint you just need a few little nudges to get you over the first hurdle. You made an excellent decision with the bone white which is much easier to paint amp shade than a pure white. A brown pigmented wash would shade this entire model really nicely as your colour palette is all warm tones. Combine the thinned paint amp shading from the wash with a little more variation on your base try some sand static grass etc to break it up and youll have a seriously good looking force. Dont be afraid of dips or magic washes either if you want a gentle introduction to easy shading. ,Warmachine,d3law8c,3,t5_2s3ta

8030213,0,t3_4p5tmq,Unfortunately Gaspy took  or  nerfs all at once to the point where he now has nothing going for him.Also unfortunately nearly everything Cryx that isnt a warjack also got nerfed both individually and by the new general rulesmechanics. While I agree Cryx specifically bane spam and gaspyskarre were in for some changes they really went overkill on the nerfs without giving much in return and basically turned Cryx into design space utopia. Everything feels rounded down just for safety especially when comparing the new cards to other Warmachine factions where they pushed the limits. Its like the other Warmachine factions were designed by a completely different team and standards.Due to this safe design Cryx feels really bland and boring to me rather like MK Cygnar. There are still  or  very good lists to be made but most infaction stuff is outclassed by mercs and doesnt seem to have a place in a good list.Anyway everything is still playable as long as you dont play for the high competitive aspect of the game. However if you do I recommend you to look into Machine Wraiths the Kraken the Withershadow Combine and a caster that suits your playstyle. Denny the Witch Coven Venethrax Skarre and quite a few other Cryx casters still look really good even with the nerfs.

ARM  is basically the breakeven point both are rolling dice against ARM  and dice on ARM .  The Defender will have the edge on anything lower and the Hunter will have the edge on anything higher.  Obviously the Defender has some more melee capabilities but it does kind of bug me that it has a point less of RAT.  As far as an AP heavy I think it could work as a ish point character jack maybe a pow  AP gun with reload.

Trollbloods Idk who youre talking to but they are wrong. Trolls are straight up strong this edition and are all about smashing with huge powerful units. Madrak  can solo armies through surfing moving and attacking and Ragnar and Gunbjorn are solid casters as well. These guys are maybe more like Deathwing than Orks.Cryx is also considered pretty weak so far.

I try to place them on the side my opponent doesnt have much and run them up the side to make them spread out.  If they dont I swing them behind and harrass.  Havent used bloodtrackers since mk since local meta has gone really jack heavy so cant give specific advice there but with the reeves you have a shooty unit already.  I would suggest adding the ua for the reeves and a blackclad wayfarerLanyssa Ryssyl for hunters mark.  Seriously those two models have won me so many games at worst a marked target gives you an extra attack charge for free  extra fury available  and at best someone leaves their caster a half inch out side your normal charge range letting you get a suprise assasination.  Especially since people like to leave their caster behind objectives jacks something lower defence so you mark that and use the extra range to get in melee with the caster as well.That would leave you with pts for a light warbeast or min unit of skinwalkers so you have something to screen with.,Warmachine,d6cp7rr,2,t5_2s3ta

8874773,0,t3_51srv1,Harbinger might as well not have a feat any more it just doesnt have the range to deny as much of the battlefield as her squishyness wants her to. That being said her spell list is still pretty decent. Crusaders Call and Guided Hand combo together to make a strong alpha strike and Purification is a  radius fuck you to any opponent who wants to make use of upkeeps. If you include an arc node then Rebuke has a potential  range which considering that the game is played on a  table means you can stick it on pretty much anything you want. Im honestly not sure what to do with her anymore while her spells are decent they arent good enough to make me want to play her as a strong caster like I would Sevvy nor are they great at defence and control like Kreoss. While her huge focus stat makes me think that she should be good at having a lot of jacks she also doesnt have any abilities or spells that make that seem particularly good like Amon or Tristan have and at least in MKII she wanted to keep a bit of focus to herself because of how easy she is to hit and hurt. She just seems to be pretty average at a few different things but not great at any of them.While I havent played him Reznik looks like a lot of fun Curse is great and Lamentations of Suffering is a very nice defensive buff. Boundless Charge makes your jacks surprisingly fast putting vengeance on things can be great and Lamentation tells the enemy warcaster to back the hell off or be useless. Also his feat looks like a lot of fun and at the very least forces your opponent to think carefully about positioning unless they want their guys to blow each other up when they die. I can already see a cool concept for playing him keep in mind that this is pure theory from me as I havent played him. A unit of Vengers to keep him company and charge anything that comes near a jack lineup of a Dervish or two Fire of Salvation and a Redeemer or two to make use of both Boundless Charge and his feat. Choir for buffs a pair of Vassals to help power jacks and a unit of Idrians with their UA for some extra ranged support or a choice of Temple Flameguard Exemplar Cinerators or Exemplar Errants for better melee tank and area control depending on what you are facing. Off the top of my head that would be my starting point for running him but it probably needs some tweaking that can only come from actual play experience.Thats my thoughts about those two specific casters if you want some more general ideas or suggestions on other casters to look at then please ask Im more than happy to help out as much as I can,Warmachine,d7emf96,5,t5_2s3ta

10060063,0,t3_5jtdnv,Also protectorate albeit casual. And Ive noticed people really dont like changes they find theyre one magic combination of stuff and stick with it. If something should change within their component its clearly bad. And well its easier to get mad at the gamedeveloperspeoplewhocausedthechange rather than accept they over invested in a skew.Anecdote time I played yugioh that other cardgame that isnt magic years ago and they released erratas  times a year banning cards that due to oversights that led to certain combinations working way too well and were basically impossible to beat outside of a hard counter.Theres a lot of parallels to the yugioh and PP erratas and fallout lots of people knew they were buying into a broken idea and go that was fun while it lasted. Others became salt factories of tears claiming that their collection just got invalidated.Those people never realized the most important imo point its not about your collection its about the game. Youre the one who made the choice to pick up  mad dogs which luckily Ive never faced myself and why in the world you thought it wouldnt get touched as an idea is beyond me. Thats where the parallels end since heres the kicker theres nothing stopping you from using them all still other than you realizing that it doesnt have the old magic in it. In yugioh banned cards became almost worthless other than being really rare. Also Konami hates its fanbase. Thats different too. They also hate everything theyve ever built up.So thats me. And yes as a Menite I bought into double bastions. I played  game with both. It was that moment I realized these are kind stupid.

11208541,0,t3_6008dr,I have been playing since MkI just before Legends. I had a similar experience with premeasuring but very different perspective on it. I got good at eyeballing distances quickly and I learned to always ask questions about my opponents threat ranges. I was sometimes off by a bit but over the years my eye got more and more accurate.Toward the end of MkII I found myself winning games because of this skill that existed entirely outside of the game. I could almost premeasure with my eye and using a little math including Pythagorean Theorem on a few too many occasions I could see threat ranges and make so many of my opponents charges fail. Winning games like that felt cheap. Why should my ability to differentiate . from . matter? Why should my opponent be forced to spend extra focus to charge a model thats only . away when she cannot be certain that the distance is less that . and in doing so give up an attack that would have ended the game?With the addition of premeasuring Ive lost some of that edge I had but never deserved. I still have a slight edge in timed games but it just saves me a few seconds here and there. My wins feel more like wins though and that makes me happy. ,Warmachine,df2h4ke,18,t5_2s3ta
