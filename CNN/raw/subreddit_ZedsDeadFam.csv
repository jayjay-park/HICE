9558378,0,t1_d9r8q3e,Thats a fair assessment. I dont entirely agree with you but there are some very obvious shots at the radio with tracks like Too Young primarily as well as some others.If those tracks are enough to turn you off to the album then there isnt much else to say on the issue. Personally I think some of what you are saying about it comes from the spacey vibe of the album as well. But if you break down the songs IMO you can almost  compare them to songs they have done in the past and hear very similar sounds.Blame would be similar to like Lost You or Collapse or any of their other Anthem songs.Me No Care is very similar to any of the Drum and Bass they have pumped out through the years. And I think you could do this for most songs on this album Im listening to other music right now otherwise Id give more examples.But on top of that the thing that I liked about this album is that it is a very complete work. They stick to a sound throughout the album and the songs all fit that sound. Listening to this album from start to finish is better than listening to any one song individually which is a skill thats lost on many EDM artists I think. ,ZedsDeadFam,d9r9lmv,3,t5_39mac
