2510036,0,t1_cmm6rbc,A few songs do Mindsweep Appeal I flows into one true colour Never let go.. flows into myopiaMyopia kinda flows into torn apart Torn apart goes into the interlude well but other than that not really. The only song that was really jarring when it started was the last garrison.I feel that the way the album is structured is strong enough to not need all the songs flowing into one another and the way shikaris songs are itd be damn hard for them to make every one flow without sounding a bit cheap.,EnterShikari,cmm77kp,2,t5_2sy5v

2844582,0,t1_cnmlbjn,Dear Future Historians. And Ill tell you why. Same reason why John Mayers Dont Stop is Train is great.If youre in your mid twenties done with school spreading your wings a bit working some job somewhere you cant help but feel is this it?. All those stories your teacher told you how you could be anything you wanted turned out to be lies. You are now in some job you may or may not like but youre most likely not going to do anything worth remembering even  years after your death.And Enter Shikari tells you thats fine. Its okay. You may not have done anything great nothing that will be remembered by the world but you can be there for the ones you love. Share the laughs and cries and generally be a friend. And that hit me harder than I thought. And that goddamn breakdown its such an awesome crown on a sweet song really hammering that its all fine feeling home.,EnterShikari,cnrferd,15,t5_2sy5v

2907191,0,t3_2tesrp,We went into a room with a bunch of people and filmed it then went into another room and pretended to play the song and filmed it then we followed this guy around and filmed it. Now theyre gonna do some editing.Very informative. Though I think such a powerful song deserved a more modest less attentionstealing video and it got it. Arguing With Thermometers had a huge message overshadowed by its silly but good video concept.,EnterShikari,cnyjz31,2,t5_2sy5v
