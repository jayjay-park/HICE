Your other classes will likely be much smaller around  people in total. Profs are generally quite accessible if you make an effort to meet up with them but this isnt a liberal arts college so you probably wont get a chance to chat with them in the grocery store.

The video clip in the article describes the crime as happening near campus but thats always kind of bothered me since as I recall it happened in an area no one at least in the s wouldve really considered remotely being part of USCs neighborhoodit was outside of the areas patrolled by USC. Its kind of like living in a downtown or other built up area block by block changes pretty quick and distances just arent really thought of the same way. EDIT I looked it up it happened on this block  Raymond Avenue Los Angeles CA I remember doing JEP at the Vermont Ave Elementary School several blocks east of there but I never knew anyone who lived west of the elementary school.

1549571,0,t3_2bz6jh,You picked the right place to ask! Ive got a few questions of my own though did you change your major to CS when you transferred? from which university?As for your questions. No. It all comes in and counts toward your class standingregistrationetc. Hopefully most will articulate to something or another without your involvement. Try to appeal for GE credit if at all possible after your TCR comes in. Appeal for USC unit equivalency for everything if you can support it. You might get a free minor out of it or something. You can only do this your first semester so do it now.      Youre technically obligated to supply USC with any and all academic records but I suppose you could accidentally forget to provide a community college transcript or something. I dont really see the point though. Just bring it in. You wont be able to at a later time without a massive headache. . It depends. SAP eligibility is actually calculated based on semesters and unit count.  total units units per semester   semesters.    Youre now enrolled in a single degree BS program meaning youre entitled to no less than  total units of aid before you start filing paperwork. SC units combined with all transfer units.     You now have  units to use before SAP becomes an issue provided youre a single degree candidate in CSCI. At the  unit standard youll have  semesters eligibility.     After that youll need to appeal for a SAP extension. Its no big deal the first time. Talk to your advisor ifwhen it comes to that. Thatll get you one more semester more or less automatically. Every student is basically guaranteed one SAP extension for any reason. Think of it as a get out of jail free card.    If you were to declare a double major special rules would apply granting you an additional  units to complete your degrees. Regardless you may also be able to stay longer on additional SAP appeals as a single degree student. This is handled on a case by case basis and since youre a transfer student that probably just declared CS youll probably be able to swing an extra SAP semester with an approved course plan and your advisors help. Minors are ineligible for additional SAP unit extensions. . No is no. Youre coming in with .    You should always ask the articulation office for stuff though. Theres no reason not to. Who knows if theyll grant it! Ask them about not transferring the elective units. USC has a wonderful bureaucracy for me anyway and no one really can keep up with all the rules so you might be able to get away with it. Again you shouldnt need to though. Id be willing to bet you can get your degree done in  semesters. ,USC,cjaig6k,2,t5_2qwwi

3465183,0,t1_cpmgc2c,Im sorry you feel that way about your alma mater and hope that the degree and experience was at least somewhat worth it to you. Again USC is not pocketing profits and it gives over a quarter of a billion dollars back to undergrads in USC scholarships and grants every single year before you count federal grants cal grants or anything SC does for any of its  grad students. The tuition that youre talking about is more often than not not paid in full by undergrads. Over  of them are on some sort of USCdetermined need based financial aid and  are on some sort of meritbased scholarship.  USC is expensive no argument there from anyone. But it also gives out more university grants and scholarships that virtually any of its peers and has increased need based grant funding by  since  and has made getting more money for those grants a major priority of the fundraising campaign that you complained about above. I am fine with USC having the audacity to try to improve when others are cutting programs and doing a lot worse than a . tuition increase to get more money from students while providing worse services. Again thats fueled by private donations not my tuition. Im actually impressed that they were able to get the pledges they did during that time and think its a testament to the Trojan Family thats a little more real than the cliches that you normally hear. I dont have a problem with the board having a nice lunch when every single member has put several million dollars of their money into the school nor do I have a problem with USC not forcing its faculty and guests to present their research in some basement with no food. Its always going to be a private school with all the positives negatives resources and inefficiencies that come with that. And not once did I say that USC needs to increase tuition. I just said that they werent jacking it up and supported that statement. And if you really think USC is simply taking advantage of  year old kids and their parents and transfers and grad students because they want fancier dinners then I would respectfully suggest you are ignoring more than a few facts to fit your preferred narrative. ,USC,cpn97rz,3,t5_2qwwi

They get a free ticket to every game and often give them away.  Also someone in the Band might be able to get you onto the field.I was in the Band this was  years ago and would have set you up.  Another angle you might try is contacting the Athletic Department and telling them that youre writing an article for your local Swedish newspaper.  They might let you on the field with a camera.  Though you might want to actually write a small column and take some pictures to submit to your local paper.  Maybe theyd find that interesting.Also I strongly recommend a trip to Tommys.  USC students and alumni have been going there for decades  it is a tradition.  Its not expensive.  Be warned multiple washings will not get the chili smell off your hands.  Which is OK it is part of the experience.I dont know if youre looking for other things to do in LA but here are a couple of suggestions.  One place that doesnt get mentioned often in tourist guides is Palos Verdes.  It is so beautiful up there.  You can hike down to semiprivate beaches and wander around the equestrian trails.  Or even rent a horse if you want.  It is a wonderful part of the city.You might consider a day trip over to Catalina Island.

6355304,0,t3_42ovaq,The internship week industry panels usually involve panels of professionals split up by industry e.g. real estate where you talk about what your firm does and how you made it to where you are now. Students then do QampA and theres a networking session that follows. This is one of many programs that happens on campus that puts students in contact with firms that hire trojans into their internship programs.I believe this is a cheaper way for smaller firms to gain access to recruiting trojans on campus versus hosting a private info session where it is just your firm with students for a similar panel  qampa  networking format. Usually these are done by bigger firms like apple google GE jp morgan etc.This will also make it easier to network and field a couple of interested candidates versus just dropping an internship position on the careerSC job website.USC has a pretty robust real estate development program that feeds into a lot of local real estate firms so I imagine the turnout would be pretty good.

6765290,0,t1_d0j47b5, of the school participates in Greek life. This is higher relative to the UCs and I think thats what gives off the perception of USC being school with large Greek presence. Greeks simply a concept that most Californians arent familiar with and dont like very much given the cultural connotations so its presence at USC is blown up a bit out of proportion. By comparison schools like Dartmouth have  of their student body participating in Greek.Realistically if you want to avoid Greek stay off of th street and you wont even know its there. If you want to straddle active night life without the commitment of Greek thats where it gets a bit harder because a lot of Greek parties are exclusive. There are so many clubs and societies that youll probably find a group of people youll like and share interests with. Whether or not theyre likely to want to get turnt up every night with you is a different matter. There are also professional fraternities that are a bit less intenseserious than social fraternitiessororities.Id say the people here are pretty nice but thats kind of a lame question to ask and a lamer one to answer. Youll have to see for yourself. LA is a pretty stuck up city as a whole though. People dress and walk around like theyre hot shit but if you actually talk to them theyre just normal people.

Ive driven through south central and skid row at night and can tell you the area around the USC campus doesnt even come close to being that sketchy. Though you might be coming from a sheltered suburban upbringing and this is your first time living on your own Id recommend refraining from forming such opinions until youve matriculated and had a chance to explore the neighborhood and DTLA. I think youll find it isnt really ghetto and the convenience of its location is actually pretty awesome. USC is on the southern edge of DTLA. Youre in an urban environment like a lot of other urban university campuses so that means living in a working class community with traffic and other aspects of urban life. Think of it as living in or close to downtown of most other major U.S. cities. The campus is literally down the street from the big offices which makes it super easy for students to take the expo line downtown for their internships and for big professionals to come to campus to recruit. This is one factor contributing to USC having the top accounting program on the west coast. ,USC,d958dag,2,t5_2qwwi
