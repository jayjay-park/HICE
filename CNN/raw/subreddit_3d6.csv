Actually this is true for any set of armor in order to boost the max dex to armor bonus but it works best with a chain shirt. As for the class I recommend RangerFighter into Deepwood Sniper. Pick up Improved Critical Woodland Archer Crossbow Sniper Darkstalker etc. Pick these up with them fighter levels. You should end up with a pretty large crit range and a x crit modifier along with some pretty nifty hidingstalking abilities. ,3d6,ceigkat,2,t5_2wkux

Especially if I have my end of stuff well prepared ahead of time.Part of the idea is this. I usually tend towards melee characters. Over the years I have played a lot of fighters barbarians monks and occasionally rogues. A while back I was joining a game that was already in progress and found that the party was already super melee heavy so I ended up making a wizard. Turns out I had a blast but I never would have played a wizard on my own.

While I picked two feats for th and th level these are a bit more open. Leap attack helps with charges but its not a must have for you. Arcane disciple is another thats not needed but it does open up your spell list. Choose a domain with lots of touch spells to channel.

2063112,0,t1_cl220v7,For DEX the AC adjustment is going to apply to your armor class. If high enough it lowers your armor class making you harder to hit. I dont believe this adjustment is applicable any round you are surprised. As for wisdom  I believe the adjustment apples specifically to illusions so if you have a high enough WIS you get a bonus to your saving throw vs. spell if that spell is an Illusion. Im on my mobile right now and will verify this information in a few minutes.EDIT Heres what the PHB saysgtA high Wisdom protects against illusions charms and other mental attacks. If it is an attack against the mind add that bonus to the Save vs. Spell saving throw.gtDexterity if high enough can give a character a slightly higher chance of avoiding the effects offireballs lightning bolts crushing boulders and other attacks where nimbleness may be ahelp.So it does affect your saving throws and not just your AC. Any save vs. spell saving throw where nimbleness may help also gets the bonus.gtIn some situations beneficial Dexterity modifiers to Armor Class do not apply. Usually this occurs when a character is attacked from behind or when his movement is restrictedattacked while prone tied up on a ledge climbing a rope etc.This doesnt specifically say surprised it seems to just apply to situations like backstab. My group has always played it as no bonuses when surprised but you and your DM should use it at your discretion. Hope this helps!,3d6,cl22evi,3,t5_2wkux
2075280,0,t1_cl38sdk,Just to clarify your point for uIrateMollusks sakeThe DC for a spell save is   the casters relevant ability mod  the casters proficiency bonus according to page . When you reach level  youll get spells to use. If you as a Ranger cast a spell on an enemy that enemy needs to beat a    your WIS mod of   your proficiency bonus of  in order to shake off the effects of your spell.If the enemy is proficient in the relevant saving throw it means hell only need an  to beat your spell. Thats not very challenging. So if you plan on using spells often you may want to consider putting some more points into your Wisdom stat. Rangers should have good Perception and Survival skills anyways and Wisdom will help you with that.On the other hand its always cool to build your characters abilities to your character concept and not in the name of making the most powerful character possible. I think having a suboptimal Ranger who happens to be a snobby brainiac is pretty cool.Lastly  its OK if you arent  on the rules. Its your first time.

2616797,0,t3_2ptxa3,Under Pathfinder there are no current ways to give a Barbarian class the Sneak Attack Class Feature. However A Barbarian is still decent at sneaking since they do usually have a bit more dex than a Fighter as they do not get Heavy Armor Proficiency in the Vanilla Barbarian.My recommendation is this for a level  Build pt. Buy Race Human.Str Dex  for Human Con  Int  Wis  Cha Level  Daring Champion Cavalier This gives you weapon Finesse as a feat that works with other feats. Then you take Weapon Focus  Handed Slashing Weapon I would use Battle Axes then the Feat Slashing Grace since you have a bloodrage I assume ACG is available. This gives you Dex to Damage with a  handed Slashing weapon which treats it for all feats and class abilities as a  handed piercing. Now that it is a  handed Piercing Champions FInesse will give you Dex to Hit.As for your Free Teamwork Feat you want Precise Strike so you get essentially Sneak Attack of d but you can share it with your whole party and it isnt limited as normal sneak attack is.You have now moved Barbarian from a Str to a Dex class.Level  Urban Mad Dog Barbarian. This Gives you more effective combat when fighting multiple enemies and an animal companion that you can flank with if need be. Since you have Rage your Damage is still really high as Urban lets you up your Dexterity instead of Str.As for the Wording in Mad Dog as written you get a second Rage since it never states it takes away the original one but that is at Mad Dog level .Level  Two Weapon FIghting. Barbarian level  now you get  to attack when flanking with your War Beast including the penalties the enemy suffers for being flanked.Right now you should be DC Cavalier  UMD Barbarian Level  Alchemist this gives you Throw Anything so you can throw Axes and that sweet Mutagen that can increase your Dexterity even more the other affects are pretty sweet. Plus by now you should have nearly every skill as a class skill and the Skill points to have at least  rank in all of them.Level  This level is sorta a filler as you can continue down Barbarian for Rage Powers Alchemist for a few more extracts and poison use or even go back to cavalier for a few more to get AC bonuses but that isnt necessary.So really what I would do at level  is DC Cav  UMD Barb  Alch  just so you can poison your Axes.Your Dexterity by Level  with Mutagen and COntrolled Rage is. if you put the level  point in Dexterity so you are very powerful with single attacks plus flanking someone with your War beast all but guarantees a hit.,3d6,cn05jte,5,t5_2wkux

2739172,0,t1_cnfdfcf,ehhhh. so at th level your pet can help for free. free advantage is cool and will improve your overall damage per round and at  when your beasty can attack twice for one of your attacks then youre catching up with the hunter and youll be competitive. beasts can get some really great attacks great utility from those attacks and have a bunch of outofcombat utility but thats a long time to deal with being relatively subpar.the general consensus is that rangers are a it outclassed across the board and my limited play experience with them agrees. dualwielding i assume thats what youre doing and not using a twohanded sword as you posted isnt the best in e imho either. switch to a bow and youll feel marked improvement in at least your survivability. keep hunters mark up and youll squeeze a bi more damage out and reliably keep it up when youre at range.but frankly youll get a big damage spike if you switch to hunter. colossus slayer i a consistent d of damage you just make sure youre letting other people open up on whatever youre fighting and then you tear into them. horde breaker is also great for damage per round but youll be spreading the damage out a bit. this one mostly just depends on the fights youre seeing from your DM possibly leaning towards horde breaker.really with a  in dex and either finesse weapons or a bow you should be hitting reasonably often and reasonably hard at low levels no matter what. youre pretty well ahead of the curve especially for a human.as for spells... again i have less experience here but i see some good options. i would say coordinate with your primary spellcasters see if theres anything you can keep on hand for them to free up their prepd options and  or spell slots. cordon of arrows looks like some ok offaction damage. cure wounds is always handy to have around you never know when someone nearby is gonna get messed up and even if you do take my suggestion and switch to a bow backup healing can pretty much always be appreciated. self buffs can be decent too longstrider jump etc. ranger spells seem to me to be split between utility  buffing and some interesting damage options. otherwise uegamma looks like theyve got a good grasp of spell choices for making big hp totals into little hp totals.all this being said... my only experience with ranger has been a highly nonoptimized dual hatchet wielding human with  str   dex  wis and  con who went beastmaster and ran around with a boa constrictor. he was a pirate and he was super duper fun. he didnt really lag behind anyone damagewise except the rogue and yknow. rogues do damage and skills and thats their bag. im well aware that this is a spot for optimization but you have to keep your DM in min if there are important things going on outside combat rangers till have a few really good options to bring to the table.,3d6,cnffkis,1,t5_2wkux

3417719,0,t1_cph6sm6,Point of information? Lockdown builds may not do a ton of damage but thats only if they are entirely focused on defense. There is another level to lockdown sometimes called crackdown which focuses on taking enemy attacks or AoOs to power up damage... it usually uses crusader since crusaders already have some of that mechanic built in. Stormguard Warrior is a good example... take a pass on one AoO get bonuses to damage next round. Karmic StrikeRobilars Gambit isare another example.As a demonstration consider a crusader with Stormguard Warrior Defensive Sweep Combat Reflexes Improved Trip Robilars Gambit and Stand Still using the Thicket of Blades stance and a guisarme and armor spikes. You hold your action to be after the enemy in the turn order. An enemy enters the first space you threaten then moves to come through it. You make a trip attempt ideally succeeding. On your turn you take a five foot step to get adjacent to him and use Combat Rhythm to make several touch attacks. Lets say . Other enemies shoot you or something for a few damage fueling furious counterstrike. On their turn they can try a few things but anything they do has to start with a move action to stand incurring an AoO which you will forego to fuel Channel the Storm. If they try to withdraw you forego the first AoO as they leave the space adjacent to you then hit them the second time as they try to leave your reach weapon... and Thicket of Blades lets you hit them even if theyre trying to foot step or full withdraw and you deal  extra damage from Combat Rhythm on that AoO plus Stand Still means theyre done... theyve used two move actions. Then you get to full attack them.If they try to attack you instead of leaving Robilars Gambit gives you an AoO which you can choose to either forego for  instead of  to hit and damage on your turn or you can just take the attack and smack them with the extra  from Combat Rhythm possibly tripping them in the process. Then because they used a move to stand and a standard to attack they are done and incur Defensive Sweep which gives you another AoO... again you can take it or not. Most likely youll forego the Robilars AoO and take the Defensive Sweep AoO to trip them again. Then you full attack them.On your turn when you full attack in either scenario you have  most likely to hit from Channel the Storm plus whatever bonus to hit you get from furious counterstrike plus theyre probably prone for another effective . And for damage you have your  extra from Combat Rhythm  extra from Channel the Storm and whatever bonus youre getting from furious counterstrike. If you have Power Attack you can dump most of your BAB into Power Attack since you have so many bonuses to hit. You can easily expect to deal a hundred damage.And the really fun thing? You can do all this while keeping other people locked down with Stand Still or tripping because all of those AoOs you didnt take to fuel Channel the Storm dont count against your AoO limit per round... you didnt take them. So you can still use your other AoOs to lock people down until you get round to focusing on them. Have a party member hit you with Enlarge Person to control more space and be adjacent to more tripped enemies while youre at it.Oh and since I neglected to mention it... never forget to scream HIT ME MOOOORREEE!!!! while playing.

Attacks per turn. xth Level Divine Smites.d Smites d Extra Attack d Bonus Attack d Hex  Strength  Hate  Lifedrinker  GWM. to  damage average of  damage overall. The scariest part imo is the  damage regardless of dice rolls. Assuming all your attacks hit anyway.For reference Meteor Storm does   on a successful save to  damage average of  damage overall.Thats some pretty solid Nova damage. Even without the smites every attack that hits deals  damage.Gross.EDIT Forgot the  from Dueling which brings the top end just slightly higher than Meteor Storm. Im not gonna edit the whole thing just to add  damage though.,3d6,d5zcifz,5,t5_2wkux

9776843,0,t1_dai2hw7,It works. Aint optimized but it works.Nitpicks You can only add  AC from Dex if youre wearing medium armor. AC should be  BreastplateDexDefense StyleShield. Consider picking up Medium Armor Master with one of your future feat slots.Per the multiclass rules you will have to take the  levels in Ranger first then the  levels in Fighter as you do not have the  Wisdom needed to do it the other way around. As such you would only have proficiency in Str and Dex saving throws multiclass does not grant saving proficienciesI should mention that just grabbing a regular melee weapon and picking up Dueling Style instead of Archery works out to a decent amount more damage as well as leaving a feat slot open good feats would be Medium Armor Master Shield Master Savage Attacker Sentinel Resilient Tough...,3d6,dai7mni,0,t5_2wkux
9899240,0,t3_5gzvdc,          Dont dump Cha as you promote your god so people should like you. You need  STR for heavy armor and CON is always important. If your feeling like Hard Core Mode Swap CON with CHA and then swap INT with CON. By Design healers are not made to outheal all incoming damage. This isnt a video game. If people are hurt their main goal then becomes Back out get refreshed and then go back in. Go with Life domain anyway over Light and Sacred Flame is now your blasty Fire theme. Id suggest grabbing Magic Initiate Druid for Shillelagh. That will handle any melee concerns. Produce Flame also nets you a fiery feel. As the first level spell since it never grows Id grab GoodBerry. This creates  berries that last  hours. With your Disciple of Life each berry heals  hp which is better than a potion. So a guaranteed HP healed on  cast that can be spread over  hours and you save your actual spell slots. Hand those out to the party so they can take care of themselves and if you drop they can actually bring you back.With your Melee Armor Fiery Range and heals covered your free to do as you please and spread the light of Lathander. There is always another dawn.At level  You can get Observant to max your Wisdom. Or even Healer to save your Spell slots between combats.,3d6,daxw71o,2,t5_2wkux
10058969,0,t1_dbhbgpm,As a barbarian you should be boosting CON before DEX.

10305987,0,t3_5ngdh3,With the DMs approval I want to fluff mounting the Mechanical Servant as entering an ExosuitPower Armor that I can fly around in a la Iron Man. Or be a mechanical webslinger with a Giant Spider. As for the mechanics I see some synergy if you pick up a Magic Initiate to get a familiar along with your servant to use their actions to place caltrops and ball bearings where you throw your tanglefoot bag. The baddies are in difficult terrain with their speed halved and if they dont move at half of THAT they might be proned and or damaged and stopped by a caltrop.Also Giant Spiders have blindsight which synergizes well with smoke sticks.,3d6,dcc8lzw,3,t5_2wkux

Do you want to focus on smiting heathens or keeping others safe from harm?For your first e campaign I recommend playing either a Vengeance Paladin with the Great Weapon Master feat offenseoriented or an Ancients Paladin with the Polearm Master  Sentinel feats defenseoriented. I think that Variant Human is the best choice for race in both cases as paladins want to max both STR and CHA ASAP but also benefit greatly from feats.,3d6,dcxb5wb,3,t5_2wkux

10656404,0,t3_5sg28a,I dont know much about Vigilantes have you checked out any of the archetypes? It seems they already get a lot of skill ranks per level so I wouldnt worry about Int. With  ranks per level you can put a rank in diplomacy bluff sense motiveintimidate stealth perception and linguistics every level. Im sure your party wouldnt expect you to cover any other skills.  If you plan on staying at range and stealthing a lot I wouldnt focus con much either.  Personally Id go for something like  Str   Dex  Con  Int   Wis   Cha        You could swap some from Cha to put more into Int Ive found that social aspects of the game are usually handled better with roleplay rather than rollplay so having insane Cha might not be necessary. A GM rarely punishes a player for delivering a good speech then rolling a crap check on the occasion they do itll be funny!  Race wise Id go for something that has no negatives to stats Aasimar for Wis and Cha Hobgoblin for Dex and Con etc. Or something classic like human halfelf or halforc.  Its hard to give much more advice without knowing the rest of the party composition if they have combat pretty well handled you could drop some from strength and put more into Int  Cha as you see fit.

I found one of the best things for the build was picking up the feat sentinel.

Keeping CON at an odd score to take Resilient CON at level  which helps immensely with your concentration checks. For spells at level  Id go Bless which is an absolute must.Healing Word for InCombat Healing.Command for its versatility namely in provoking OAs through the Flee action.

11373577,0,t1_dfl4lpw,You make a good point about Commanders Strike but it eats up one of the two attacks and then also a bonus attack. I dont know for sure what other characters Ill be playing with but unless its another rogue Im not sure one of their strikes will be better than two of my own. Ill have to consider it though.The other thing I didnt list here that I was thinking about for Trip Attack was knocking down enemies who are trying to flee though with my Cunning Action for Dash it is already somewhat difficult to escape from me by just running. Being able to shoot them with a crossbow and knock them Prone would make it very difficult to run away from me.You also make some good points about Disarming Attack I hadnt really considered that one. My DM does like Wizards a lot so knocking their spellbook out of their hand would be pretty amusing.I think you might be right that Disarming Attack would be better than Trip Attack.,3d6,dfl6ahe,1,t5_2wkux
11442486,0,t3_639xvm,Whatever you do get to paladin lvl  ASAP. A second attack is just too good to be delayed for long. Maybe take a single warlock level first but no more! I went fiend vengeance with sword and shield and like it. The temp HP from fiend are really nice for a tank. But you need to get the finishing hits so a potent offense is a must. I will go paladin lvl  for the aura and the rest warlock. ,3d6,dfszua9,3,t5_2wkux
11672799,0,t3_66jt3j,first off Id decide what exactly it is that you want him to do.artificers are nice because their main focus is making magic items. There is a lot that you can do with magic items. magic items can make someone a better combatant. this could be the party fighter making his already good fighting skills even better. Or it could be used to turn a meh combatant like an artificer into someone able to keep pace with a dedicated fighter. Artificers dont really need to invest in many feats and as such can get some combat feats without messing any thing up. If you go this route expect you to play like a war cleric using your magic items and enhancement abilities to make up for raw BAB. alternately magic items can be used to play caster. If you do this you would end up like a well armored wizard with an even bigger focus on preparation. Anything one of the full casters can do you can do earlier but with prep time. While other casters prepare each day you prepare during downtime. this has the advantage of allowing you to stockpile. This playstyle requires really good forsight and planning but depending on the pacing allows you easily prepare for the worst and tailor your abilities specifically to the challenge at hand. If you go this route youll want to focus your feats on crafting faster cheaper and with less xp used.If the battle artificer sounds your speed Id take a look at the racial substitution levels in races of eberron. Youd lose your hommonculus along with your ability to get crafting reserve from breaking magic items in exchange for casting on yourself better double reserve usage for magic arm armor constructs and get an intelligent weapon familiar. Id basically just ignore the substitution levels if going a castificer.general advice dont be afraid of crafting. Noone likes spending xp but if you dont then the reserve just goes to waste. dont e afraid of trying to talk people in the party into providing the xp. Also dont forget that you can use your infusions on yourself. People can lose stuff. You cant lose your bodyeasily anyway,3d6,dgj4m7d,1,t5_2wkux
11711746,0,t1_dgniw4h,Yea seems like the stats are hard to make work even though dex based paladins are pretty effective. Having to do  in str and Cha is just too much. Quarterstaff  is able to be wielded with two hands for the hit and let go of for the unarmed attacks. But even using it only one handed still is a d for with the fighting style and then  for each unarmed from martial arts or flurry. Ive seen people suggest dipping fighter for it as well. Dont unarmed attacks count as melee weapon attacks? Or does that not count for smite? Why do you need to go the unarmored route for AC? Do monk features not work in armor? MAD means the unarmored wouldnt be super helpful due to mediocre dex and wis but medium armor and shield of faith could help no?Its definitely not optimized I just saw some potential synergy but the stats make it unworkable I guess. ,3d6,dgnk0v5,1,t5_2wkux
11740332,0,t1_dgqsfia,gtgiven that the net is a weapon and youre saying an unarmed strike is a weapon why would a grapple attack not also be considered a weapon?Good counter point.
