Do you think its possible that the reason is Crashplan taking up too much bandwidth which causes issues with Steambattle.net . I mean I was actually wondering why my download speed is much lower when all I am doing is uploading data? I am not very well versed in computer networking so maybe this seems like a silly question.,Crashplan,cuur1c6,1,t5_2zjyx
