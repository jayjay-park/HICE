529540,0,t3_206hnp,Ive looked into the mandocello to use in a more band setting as well seeing as its fretted and easier to play chords on. Ive never seen one under a few thousand dollars either and most are much much more expensive than that. I honestly think its a shame since the instrument sounds really beautiful when played well!The closest I came to buying something similar was buying a mandola since the strings are tuned the same. Those are cheaper but I dont think that the experience with the cello would transfer over  to a mandola as easily as to a mandocello.,Cello,cg0grxj,2,t5_2qpfi

1089021,0,t3_26j0o9,If youre practising during the day after am and before pm I doubt youre going to have many problems.Because of my job I did most of my practising in the evenings except on weekends. A mute never really made it quiet enough. I bought a Yamaha silent cello. Really great investment but it was expensive back then .One additional point. Neighbours aside David Finkel in his youtube videos says he practices with a mute the  string metal one so he doesnt trick himself into thinking hes making a big sound just because of the small room.So .. try it and see how you go. I do recommend the silent cello in the unlikely event you get any complaints.,Cello,chs2oyb,3,t5_2qpfi

Not sure if its ideal for cello but theyre my general purpose recording mics. A cheap Maudio Presonus Tascam or Focusrite audio interface maybe used to fit in your budget and youre set.

1240857,0,t3_26t1ba,Ok. I assign this study to my students quite a bit. Let me try to give you a bit of advice based on what youve said is the problem. You feel a bit lost in the melodic flow of things yes? First simplify. Play the last sixteenth note of each group with the first sixteenth not of the next group. The will define the beats. Thing ta DUM. Do this in tempo and keep the idea of an off beat moving to an on beat. Do this  or so times. Just enough for you to feel comfortable. This will also make you aware of the large shift. Now rhythms. A great way to gain fluidity in a passage of running notes is to create a bit more structure to hang on to. do dotted rhythms. long short long short. Think galloping. Then reverse it short long short long. Then change it even more. Pretend youre in  hold the first note for three beats and then play the following three notes as one beat each. Reverse that. Do you know the sevcik?  take a look at number  in this collection and you will find about  or so rhythmic variations for groups of four sixteenth notes. not only does this give you a better hold on the form of the passage but it speeds up certain shifts and motions while slowing down others. This trains your hand to know its precise location while letting your brain have a bit more time to think about what youre doing. Once youve done all that do each large slurred gesture individually. As nycellist pointed out there are certain instances where the conclusion of a gesture is the beginning of the next. You must be aware of them individually while you are keeping the whole in your mind. As for string crossings this is where my students never practice enough. Thankfully the technique is simple. Put your left hand down. Do the string crossings on open strings. Write it out on a separate sheet of paper if you have to. It will be hard as youve removed the melodic foot holds so to speak. But the majority of messy passages come from late string crossings and overly quick left hands. Alternate between playing with the slurs and without. Vary the slur groupings similar to the way we varied the rhythmic groupings. Give this all a go and remember practice is not playing for pleasure. When you sit down to work you can either waste your time by playing your pieces over and over again and always dreading those tangly bits or you can spend fifteen minutes a day just working gently at the tangly bits so youre never afraid.Anywho I hope this helps. Feel free to ask me anything cello related if youd like to. BestIsabelle,Cello,ci97nnw,2,t5_2qpfi

1506763,0,t3_2bg520,You should find a store that offers renttobuy almost all of them do.  Then if it doesnt work out you have not spent that much but if you fall in love with cello playing then you can pay down the balance until youre ready to own the instrument you have been learning on.   Buying a poor quality instrument would be bad choice because a waste of money plus might make you hate cello just because the instrument is hard to play and sounds bad. ,Cello,cj55bty,1,t5_2qpfi
1543557,0,t1_cj9hl49,Perhaps this is a bad idea?  Anything that scratches or scrapes the wire windings on the strings if it changes the uniform density of the string even ever so slightly will change the sound adversely.  Depending on the exact location of the scraping certain higher harmonics would be emphasized others deemphasized and some detuned.  The result I believe would be a less desirable sound.  The whole reason people buy new strings regularly is to replace strings that have minor defects with fresh ones that are uniform from end to end.  I guess if you are a student you dont care too much about this but if you are a serious cellist trying to get the best sound from a good instrument such things matter a lot. ,Cello,cj9rbqv,1,t5_2qpfi

2866628,0,t3_2suvio,One thing that helped me was thinking about bow pressure as being a vector towards the center of the cello.  Playing light doesnt necessarily mean lifting the bow from the string but not pressing into the center.

4718608,0,t3_3fistu,As others say it is difficult to be precise without seeing you but such pain is very likely both from squeezing between the thumb and fingers and an awkward wrist position. The wrist should not have a significant angle either up or down in relationship to the forearm and knuckles. The best thing you can do is stop playing any repertoire for a few days and play only slow soft scales. Concentrate on playing with as light thumb pressure even without the thumb as possible. Try to place the fingers to the right side of the string as you look down the fingerboard so that you are touching the side of the string. Think of dropping the fingers rather than putting them down and rotate the forearm towards the next finger that will play ie. on st finger the palm sort of faces the floor and when placing the th finger the palm faces your body kind of like the way a pianist rotates the forearm to play a melodic octave. Once you are comfortable and consistently able to do this then take the same approach to your repertoire slow soft and deliberate practice. You likely have a very wellpracticed habit of squeezing and only slow patient methodical work will establish better habits. Use a metronome to keep your tempos under control.,Cello,ctpbhw7,1,t5_2qpfi

5830338,0,t3_3v2wjy,Left hand is not quiet  lots of unnecessary hand and finger movement rather than a secure position with efficient movement.Bend in the left wrist with left elbow held too close to the ribs.  Tension in right shoulder resulting in a jerky pinched sound instead of relaxed with the arms weight going into the bow. Not reading the correct rhythms e.g. playing quarter note same length as eighth note.  Missing sharps or flats that are in the key signature.  Inability to read intervals on the staff and produce the sounds.  E.g. seeing an octave and making sure the note actually sounds an octave from the prior one. Cockeyed bowing angle.  Bowing in the UH and tip only while the bow is riding up the fingerboard.  Wrong bow grip resulting in trying to move the right wrist hinge joint at  degrees to how it bends in a way that is anatomically impossible.  Rotating the left hand toward the nut so that all the fingers are angled to the strings with the result that intonation when crossing strings becomes problematic.  Just not hearing that their Bb and F natural are sharp.  Getting so used to the sound of the wrong intonation they have been doing that it sounds right to them. ,Cello,cxjvsym,3,t5_2qpfi

I know somebody else who began around  but performed a concerto with orchestra and won an undergraduate place at a top school at  albeit having played a different instrument to high level prior to that age.My advice would be to find a good teacher measure good by how fast you progress not by their reputation  dont be afraid to try several until you find the right one  and work hard not just physically but also mentally.

6351820,0,t3_42jz32,Does your high school offer lessons if youre still enrolled? Are they during before or after school? Talk to the conductor.One thing that might help is taking your cello to a music shop if you can. You already have an instrument but it doesnt fit you. If its a student cello ask the friend where she got it the shop might let you trade it in and put it as credit toward the proper size. This might not be common practice but the music shop we had that supplied pretty much the entire school districtgrades  through  with instruments lets you rent them and trade them in as needed the years you spent renting it were put toward an instruments purchase if you wanted.If thats not a possibility have a string shop just take a look at it. I still have my shitty student cello but it doesnt sound like one anymore. It wasnt in great shape when I got it and the bridge was backwards...but I didnt know that. The shop did. They fixed it up and it sounds just as nice as my friends cello her family did not have a lot of money but she was talented so they took out a freakin loan to get her a cello to go to school with...still blows my mind.You say you want opportunity. Wanting isnt enough you have to seek it out make it yourself. Everyone here who has suggested community groups lessons in university and making connections had the right idea. Unfortunately like so many other things in life money makes this easier and opens up more opportunities than not having money. I found a professional cellist to take lessons from but I could only afford a lesson maybe once a month. I couldnt play in my high school orchestra because I had trained under the conductor through school provided lessons as a violinist and he wouldnt take me as a cellist. Outright refused.Its so easy to get frustrated and angry in this situation but try not to. You begin to resent your instrument playing it all of it and you grow to hate it.

My simple answer is if you live in a city find a teacher and get their feedback on how to start. Then find a music shop that rents cellos. Do that for  to  months. More enterprising shops will apply your rental fees to the purchase of an instrument. The teacher andor shop will recommend the size based on your height and hand size. I only let myself worry about buying one or getting the right one after I knew I was putting on the practice required and wanted to continue. For example I rented a Primavera  with Jargar strings. Served me well for  months. My teacher said not to bother with anything less. Sort of had to trust her and Im happy with my decisions so far. I upgraded two months ago. ,Cello,daaqqdt,6,t5_2qpfi

10040897,0,t3_5ji0kk,It is more a mental picture than a muscle memory thing. You need to be able to map it in your mind. My first cello teacher introduced it to me in this way imagine your A string is broken and you have to play everything on the D string only its really your A string. You could try playing beginner level music that you already have which should be on the A string up to F above middle C. Play it on the D string. This will give you a mental image of the fingerboard for tenor clef as the difference is a fifth the interval we tune our strings to. So when you see that F  lines above bass clef and you play it on the D string it is right next to the C that is  lines above Tenor clef so the notes look the same and relate to the notes around them the same way you are just playing them a little further to the left. I suspect you might not be all that familiar with the notes in that region if you are seeking beginner tenor clef there really isnt any that I know of. I suppose that you could look through Klengel Technical studies etc. to see how he introduces it. Might take some digging those are long books but you can scan it online using the preview button once you find it on IMSLP.org     Which part are you playing in Tell there are  lines in the opening?,Cello,dbgcsjc,7,t5_2qpfi
