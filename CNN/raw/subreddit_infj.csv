8081,0,t3_1u5w8v,I can think of one occasion where I was legitimately surprised a birthday lunch a week before my bday with a cake. Aside from that I dont think I am an easy person to surprise... plus how often do people try to do that? As for excited I guess it depends on the context. When I am watching a TV show I can get pretty excited. It isnt sports or action movies though. Usually it is caused by an unexpected twist some great character development a couple moment or simply getting a combination of madexcited during a scene. Some people would interpret that as getting excited easily but I will let you guys judge that.,infj,cefcu47,2,t5_2r39a
11062,0,t1_cefn9y4,How does photography improve me?  Trust me I have seen the reality of photography and it is not what you think at all.  I think you are just falling for stereotypes and believe that what people commonly feel must be true.  Boys like video games but men play sports?  What is this ?Ive read a thousand books.  INFJs are from what i have read not good at putting thoughts into words so I apologize that my writing is less than perfect.  Do you feel better because you used a bulleted list?  I think you are trying too hard.Ahh wait I get it.  You played Dota?  The warcraft  spin off thing?  Ok so the reality is that YOU feel like you are a better person for leaving gaming and doing other things.  Maybe you couldnt balance gaming vs other parts of your life but not all of us do that.  Im married with two kids so outside of work the few hours i get to game since i dont watch tv gaming and photography are really the only hobbies i ahve time for are the one time I get to really socialize with people outside of my family.  I work alone... in a cold warehouse which along with not having patience to capilize my Is in a sentence is probably why my typing sucks... its  degrees in my office right now. Pick a subject I can talk to you about it.  Want to talk politics?  Noam Chomsky?  How about some FA Hayek and some Economics?  I rarely find anyone talking about any subject that I cant chime in on... except sports.  I have no use for it.  So dont think I just spend every free moment playing games.  HOnestly i shouldnt even have to defend myself you made a HUGE amount of assumptions as to what type of person i am.  And do you realize that MBTI is really an outdated method of characterizing people? Psychologists dont even use it anymore there was an article here on reddit awhile ago that said it is only still talked about because it is approachable for people who have no idea about personality types.  its simple and easy to understand.... but no real professional uses it.  So is your free time spent learning MBTI really helping you grow?  From what I read they arent much better than reading a horoscope.,infj,cefozya,4,t5_2r39a

Not sure if a lot of people would agree but I wrote a long rant about it one day.

238715,0,t3_1wuheh,This happens to me during meditation sometimes. If I get to a certain deep level of relaxation and focus I can think of yes or no questions I have about ordinary aspects of my life. Like work school my friends and relationships or whether or not Ive made the right choice about something. I dont always get an answer but when I do I can hear it in my head either yes or no and I can feel somehow that the answer is correct. I can also sometimes pinpoint a rough time frame for something happening. Sometimes information comes to me not as answers to a question but as symbolic imagery that only makes sense after the event occurs. I dont know where its coming from if Im just tapping into my subconscious or if its something else. But Ive never told anybody in my life about it probably because I halfway dont want to believe its real. Most of the time I come out of a meditation and it just seems like me imagining things. But then events actually happen the way Ive been told or shown they would and it seems too spooky to talk about with anyone I know.,infj,cf5hs7n,3,t5_2r39a

396097,0,t3_1yme6m,Thank you that was really interesting. The discussion about INFJs expressing strong convictions was really helpful for megtThe INFJ starts its functional stack in Perceiving mode i.e. Ni which is open and uncertain although this openness is often concealed from the outside observer since Ni is introverted before it begins to converge into a judgment a la the auxiliary Fe at which point INFJs sound more convincing and strong in their convictions.I actually have very strong ideas and convictions about certain things but when others disagree with my beliefs or bring up a point I hadnt considered before my first response is always You might be right and then I have to spend some time thinking about what theyve said and weighing it against my convictions. It makes me seem actually more wishy washy or hesitant to take a stand in conversation because Im not willing to tune out conflicting ideas. Now I see that its just part of the way I form judgments Perceiving mode is always open and uncertain.Also heres a chart of functional stacks if you are more of a visual thinker. This helped me understand just why we get along so well with INTJs we function more like them than any other type.,infj,cfltl1g,10,t5_2r39a

468221,0,t3_1zel7x,Sorry to have taken a bit of time to notice this.  Im an one of those and Ill try to respond to your questions.  Now I probably come from a different politicaleconomic perspective than you and I dont want to make my response about that.  Ill try to stay general.   Whats different about INFJ thinking in economics?  Honestly I dont believe very much at the fundamental level.  If you read the foundational treatises youll probably find a lot of stuff that resonates with you.  You may well already have of course.  Smith and Marshall and Keynes may or may not have been INFJs but the way they each differently marry logic and insight and deep human understanding is powerful.Theres a delightful difference between INFJs and INTJs when it comes to economics.  I feel that  of the crap written about economic systems is INTJstyle system building.  INFJs are much handier with dealing with subtlety.   Economics is expressed in simple examples.  Proofs or arguments or models rest entirely on the assumptions made.  Assumptions are necessarily imperfect or flat out wrong.  Simple examples necessarily glaze over fundamental complexities.  Nothing is  right or  fully explained.  It takes some finesse to hold on to the importance of a point or a concept and to honestly work it out.  You have to learn when you are leaning too heavily on the seams of an idea or overusing an assumption.  Logic doesnt carry all the water.Now the modern practice of economics may be something different than the stuff Im speaking of.  In a typical PhD program the first year is entirely quantitative and formal.  Programs that follow the Chicago model have an attrition rate of over .  Its math and formalism and everything but the beauty and depth of economic thought.  But it is vital.  I cant do much of it anymore but having learned it and forgotten it is different than never having learned it.  There are heterodox programs out there that are obviously heterodox.  I went to a conference once in Kansas City where they had a notable heterodox program.  If thats your thing thats your thing.To me economics is a deeply intuitive discipline.  It is damn complicated.  And its personal.  The stuff you find in journals is occasionally interesting but almost all of it is superficial details.  Its rare to bump into something penetrating but when you do it can be glorious.  As far as reading I have a couple things Id suggest.The first is Adam Smiths Theory of Moral Sentiments.  It is not Wealth of Nations.  I feel like people who read WoN without a sense of ToMS miss the point.  All of Smiths work is predicated on a deep understanding of people and relationships.The second much more of a throwaway is Bastiat.  All the Austrians are big fans of his which may persuade you to avoid him.  However there is an honesty in Bastiat thats hard to discount.  He is a master of taking simple examples and fairly gently working them through to conclusions.  Some of his work is a masterpiece of the kind of nuanced logic that can be the best of economics.My personal hero is Armen Alchian.  As far as doing the economics that was left to do at the time there has been no one better in my opinion.,infj,cfthl9c,3,t5_2r39a

Remind yourself that no one is paying attention to you not nearly as much as youre paying attention to yourself ESPECIALLY because these people are extroverts.

1072106,0,t1_chq56o4,I think Taoism and Buddhism are only by limited definition religions.  They are more accurately a means of exploring the inner workings of ones own mind.  My father is a Buddhist monk and I have spent some time in the monastery with him.  If we observe one thing at a time then we risk placing blinders on ourselves with regards to the whole of the thing.  Speaking for the whole of religion one might define it as any system for establishing a world view or alternatively any system wherein a person defines themselves in relationship to the universe at large.  I find these definitions too limiting.  They dont speak to the realities underlying what religion does.  That pushes us into the purview of philosophy and biology.  Belief by itself is not a positive.  People believe all manner of demented dangerous unhealthy things all the time.  Religion is institutionalized belief.  It is belief spread across a group.  That definition neatly encompasses the whole of what religion is while being specific enough to allow for individual cases where religion fails to meet our moral and intellectual expectations.  It doesnt mean whole groups wont believe demented dangerous unhealthy things.  Globally belief spread across a group can be positive or negative depending on  as you say  local conditions.  The same can be said for weather patterns.  Typhoon season is quite looked forward to in some parts of the world because it waters crops while in others its a holy terror.  Religion is not inherently positive.  If it is solely the establishment of a society were looking at then what that requires is a willingness to spread information into a new ecosystem I.E. moving from one place to another taking your geneticsocialcultural understandings into that place and supplanting whatever is there and a vector.  Religion is that vector.  It is a good as any way to do that.  Its an especially aggressive way of spreading culturegenetics insofar as it allows any action committed by a person of God or Zeus or whatever their particular flavor of deity is to be supported morally at the time theyre committing those actions as part of their particular religious group.  It allows for terrible terrible horrors...but it also allows for the establishment of a society.  It is a system for creating cohesion within society during the early phases of development but then many of the behaviors children adopt imaginary friends tantrums thumbsucking are also coping mechanisms to deal with early stages of development.  These things DO scale.I do want to say one important thing.  You have NEVER...at any point...had the mindset I do.  Im not offended and I dont want to offend you but I do want to make you aware of that fact.  Ive read your post history and were EXTREMELY different people.

But its normal to get back with an ex these days I suppose. Simply put if you want to make it work this time you need to  make sure what happened before doesnt happen again. Im an infp male with an infj girlfriend and heres something that Ive learned the mood of an infj and how they feel is very very heavily influenced by their significant other. If youre sad they will be sad. If youre enthusiastic and warm they will be happy and feel comfortable. If your boyfriend knows that youre happy then hell be happy too. So if he feels that he cant give you what you need or that youre unhappy not only will it make him sad but hes going to think its his fault. And thats every infj.So why dont you try just being happy and chilling out?

Just using the basic MBTI dichotomies will bring up a lot of cases of mistyping.Once you know how the different function combinations dom amp aux manifest the patterns just sort of fall into place. So for example TiNe for INTP look for someone who will constantly judge your statements or ideas if they fit into the persons preconceived framework of how the world works. If you say something they dont agree with theyre apt to ask you why or disagree and say no because xyz. The xyz might be where the Ne comes in and theyll offer arguments that makes sense but may seem completely unrelated to one another read Platos Euthyphro to see some examples of TiNe combo or NeTi thats debatable haha or youll see theyre just random as hell at times when the Ne brainstorm explosion of ideas comes into play.,infj,ci0o3n9,4,t5_2r39a

I end up with friends more than I end up with a date.I think part of my problem is that Ill ask questions get answers but the one question I am afraid to ask is Would you like to go out sometime? or an appropriate question similar to that. I use the rr subreddit in my area and get replies and they end up getting me a friend but not a date.Now I know that being friends before dating is a great thing but I take it to such an extreme that they no longer see me as someone they would want to date. I remember one girl said that I was more of a brother to her another said I was more like one of her girl friends. I get sad upon hearing that.Nowadays its looking like every girl in my area has a guy and soon theyll all be taken by the time I have the courage to approach a girl.I use dating apps to put myself out there since I dont go out much.

Its all so much more subjective than we make it out to be it seems like. It makes threads like these so close to pointless in my opinion.Thats not to say we shouldnt talk about these two types and how we interact with each other. As an INFP male with an INFJ girlfriend my feelings arent hurt dont worry Im always interested in this stuff. But a thread discussing how INFPs arent good friends isnt quite the discussion Id like to have. Some INFJs will love INFPs and some will hate INFPs.

So I think you may be on to something with this one. I think your word choice thinking patterns there is dead on and has a lot of power to it if more people realize what these thinking patterns can do to them emotionally and socially. We have the power to change our thinking patterns and choose our emotions.Personally my therapist doesnt like to give out or focus on diagnoses but on my receipt he lists a diagnosis code which I looked up once adjustment disorder with anxiety. Also on the MMPI he said I tested for depression. I love that you ended this with a question that promotes positivity.  My favorite way to stop myself from going mad Ive got a few. I think my favorite one is to aim to win. Doesnt matter what youre doing just pretend life is a video game like fallout or something one of those games where everything you say or do dictates who you are and how the gameplay goes. Focus on what to say to win the conversation. If this moment were a video game what would your next move be to get your desired outcome? My husband INTJ taught me to think this way and at least for me it helps a lot with anxiety in social situations. Have a winning attitude and appreciate the impact of each moment.,infj,cj4fbqs,3,t5_2r39a

2320057,0,t3_2ltn59,Yeah this is no longer a friendship. You obviously want out but are going along with it because of past loyalty and his feelings of being alone.  I can respect you wanting to do the right thing by him but its not a relationship based on healthy giveand take but instead pity and nostalgia.If you are going to continue seeing this person casually youre going to have to be more outspoken in who you are as a person and what things you want and dont want.  Dont let him change your music if he wont let you influence his choices.  Stay in the car and just roll down the window if he wants to keep talking.  Someone getting upset if you dont do exactly as they say is not a healthy person to be around. Theres a chance that if you speak your mind the friendship can adapt into something better but it sounds like he has a very set personality.  The only thing you can do is try.  Age  and the next few years are when a lot of older friendships youve had are going to fall away. Its natural. There are some relationships that were sustainable in childhood which simply do not work anymore.  Youre going to have to be the one who changes the dynamic here because he wont. If he cant or wont accept who you are as a person now then thats pretty much it.  But you have to be the one who starts vocalizing your feelings and preferences.  I mean whats the worse that can happen he stops being your friend? Either way you benefit. Theres also no shame in leaving something behind that simply isnt good for you anymore.

2390550,0,t3_2ms3eb,gtHow do you keep relationships from being onesided? Well thats pretty simple actually. I dont actively maintain relationships beyond a certain point. If the other person isnt interested in staying friends with me they usually just fade out. gtAnd how can you be satisfied with relationships in general no matter how deep or shallow they are?Thats much tougher because I think INFJs tend to have an issue with letting people be who they are. We have the ability to care deeply and we dont understand why were not receiving that kind of care in return. This leads to a lot of disappointment for us which leads to resentment which can further sabotage the relationships that were trying to maintain if we let it.Step one is recognizing that as youre getting to know someone they will tell you who they are. For example lets say Person A didnt follow through on the plans you made with them. You could take that as Person A telling you I dont care enough about you to do the things I say Im going to do. That may be but it might be a bit more useful to spin it as Person A saying I cant always be trusted to do the things I say Im going to do. Taking it personally isnt usually helpful. Step two is being grateful for this new information. Its hard not to be resentful that A isnt who you thought they were or want them to be. Theyre not someone who follows through on plans or who is respectful of your time. Thats a really really good thing to know about someone!Step three is adjusting your expectations. Take the new information into account rather than forgiving and forgetting. But dont confuse that with holding a grudge. I know thats a mistake I make a lot and Im sure other INFJs have the same issue. Grudgeholding is toxic. Its taking poison and expecting the other person to die. If you simply cant not take it personally or if it was personal then you need to let go of that relationshipfor their sake and for yours. I actually agree with your proposition that you focus on the two best friends that you do have. Thats what I do. Id say I spend about  to  of my time around people that I dont care about and who dont care about me. I think thats true of most people. Some can continue to put their nurturing instincts out there without the expectation of reciprocity but thats never been me. So I keep to myself or I connect with people on a shallow level. Conversation rarely goes outside the realm of the weather or what were watching on TV.  Id say Ive picked up maybe three lasting deep friendships over the last five or six years? All while working in the service industry and going through college. I see myself as a valuable friend to have and Im not going to waste my energy on someone who doesnt recognize that. ,infj,cm76glc,7,t5_2r39a

2507020,0,t3_2ocazt,Thats no key to the kingdom either. Feeling involves emotion. NonINFJs will pry their spleens out with spatulas rather than take leaps of faith and trust someone without a safety net to some other decision maker than the brain. If you understand INFJ at all you realize this is the problem. Nobody wants to grapple with meeting someone or knowing someone that makes them feel and then expressing that only to find out that the farthest they ever got was the brain and it was easy to maintain the boundary.Try needing to make sense to be worth anything to someone else. Needing to be an easy choice where the only thumbs ups you get are from people who carefully checked to make sure their end including nothing more than showing up. Messes with the confidence just a little bit. Nothing about love bows to logic. To use a football analogy if the defense can be sure everything the offense does is going to be done in front of them its a lot easier to dominate on defense. Thats the box most need to put INFJs in and if you only make sense when predictable and EZ and emotion is running into an easily maintained beachhead? Its gonna hurt.Most of these people who sound sad are disoriented and confused because the last thing they expect to feel when they make caring about others look easy is that the people they care about so much will be fine with your absence if it means not needing to earn or justify your regard for them.,infj,cmlt0yn,4,t5_2r39a

This way you avoid the damage you are speaking of and at the same time sort of naturally limit yourself in what is perceived and what is not.This converges with what Im playing with right now. Basically using Fe as some sort of pivot point. For me the main concern in this is getting too immersed in their perspective. So for me there has to be a second part. Being able to stand in their perspective without losing sight of my own reality. Like lucid dreaming or something. I need a resource for that. Andor I need a way to understand such a stance that keeps Fe from defining reality that never goes well with me. gtIt can also turn out to be quite insightful as you might understand why they do or do not do to themselves what they do or do not do.That part might be a trap for me  understanding the why for them etc. I feel like theres something flickering right beyond the edges of my consciousness related to this thing.,infj,cneejhy,2,t5_2r39a

2942717,0,t1_co23m0h,I think you do a great job of describing Fe. For myself and my Fiuser friends its not so much that we are slower to take action. In fact Fi folks can be very quick to react and quite volatile. The thing about Fi is that its about how the individual feels and what the individuals personal valuesethicsattitudes are. Fe users are independent people sure but the focus is on individuals harmonizing together. Fi doesnt give a flying fuck about that. Fi users have no reservations about going against the grain. Being outspoken. Standing up for their values even if those values are terribly unpopular. With respect to sponging emotional reactions I disagree there. I think what youre describing is mirroring which is something that everybody does. Some people do it with more finesse than others but its not that an Fi user bottles it up so much as they maintain a degree of independence. Like if someone is crying an Fi user will wonder why theyre crying what the appropriate response is and follow through with that. Maybe thats being comforting. Maybe thats telling the person theyre crying for no good reason and would feel happier reexamining the issue. But an Fe user is more likely to see the tears as a natural human response to stress. An Fe user is more prone to setting aside their personal judgements in favor of being helpful. And of course there are downsides to both Fe and Fi. I find that Fe users despite their reputation for being warm and caring can sometimes be deliberately cruel and ostracizing. If theres someone in a group setting who isnt following the rules Fe users wont hesitate to hurl abuses until the offender conforms to the group standard. Some Fe users in my personal experience ESFJs are like this the most also get way into power structures and use their social skills to manipulatedominatebully into a high rank in their particular social clique. On the other end its no secret that Fi users can be assholes. If you violate something important to an Fi user theyll want to make. you. pay. And the other danger of Fi can be a narcissistic my way is the best way attitude. Fe inthenow sees valuesexperiences as universalobjective tries to authentically advance the interests of the group. It doesnt matter what I think about it  what matters is the reality of the situation here.Fi achronologicallyoriented  sees valuesexperiences as personalsubjective tries to authentically be oneself. Think for yourself and draw your own conclusions about what matters to you. ,infj,co2lm4a,6,t5_2r39a

I personally enjoy being a little affectionate and enjoy seeing others who are caught up somewhat in their chemistry with each other. To me its a life affirming thing. I think the French and many Latin and European cultures in general may have a more mature attitude about this than many of we often prudish Americans to be honest. We sometimes become so caught up in being proper in a social context that we forget to live.

3192344,0,t1_costfta,Im not following the second part of your comment. To me it sounds like you struggled until you indirectly recruited support at which point you made great strides for yourself. I also dont understand the dialing back thing. In my view Im not being pushy at all  Im merely pointing to an effective solution thatll help alleviate her situation. If shes been on and off with this guy for the last  years then saying hey break up and your life will get better isnt helpful. She already has split with him repeatedly and is still in the same bad boat ergo a new approach should be taken. I also feel confused because I see two different criticisms being presented here one is that Im too pushy and the other that Im too mean. I can kinda understand pushy  theres a sense of urgency because I dont want OP to suffer any longer than she has to. But in my defense I did take great effort to explain that Im not making a personal critique against OP as a human. I feel frustrated when I clearly explain that Im not making a personal criticism but still get talked down to like Im making personal criticisms. Are you sure there isnt some misunderstanding?

I have always felt like I am on the outside looking in at others amp their relationships. It feels like I am looking into a window of someone elses life amp my identity is invisible. As I have grown older I feel like this less. I feel more grounded. My advice is to try to ignore their friendship. Even if you did get together with this guy they would still be friends amp you would feel this way every time they communicated. Work on what interests you. The more you focus on yourself amp what you are passionate about the less you will have feelings of inadequacy. Jealousy is the opposite of self confidence. It is believing the worst about yourself amp believing the worst about others. Sometimes I think other people will try to make someone jealous on purpose.

Like if somebody is new to type for example they will massively overestimate their ability to type people at first because they dont realise how complicated it is. So a guy who has known about mbti for two weeks will be like my friend is a J type its impossible for her to be a P type because she has a really tidy desk and P types are untidyIn their head working from the knowledge they have they are indisputably correct. So theyll be very confident about their conclusions because their conclusions lead perfectly from the information that theyre working from. But because they have very limited knowledge and they dont even realise how limited their knowledge actually is the conclusion theyre coming to is incorrect even though the person thinks that theyre right.Whereas somebody who is more experienced they will be factoring in more information and in their head there will be lots of different possibilities as to what it could be and that leads them to be less confident about their conclusions even though the methodology theyre using to work towards those conclusions is more accurate.,infj,cpj49o0,1,t5_2r39a

From what little you said about your attacks they sound like panic attacks. Taking a walk will definitely help just doing good little things for you not in the sense of treat yoself but still things that you know have a good chance of comfortingsoothing you will help. Breathing exercises might help. Maybe take a walk and listen to some instrumental music or something? Whenever I listen to instrumental music I always get lost trying to figure out how to play it  it helps if you play an instrument and have something you can do that with I play guitar been listening to a LOT of Daniel Bachman lately. Breathing exercises help too. Hope that helps! Let me know if theres anything else I can do to help you out.,infj,cqdyzgt,1,t5_2r39a

It could be construed that were stubborn but were really just being polite by sharing the problem with you probably because you expressed some interest in it by asking. We actually really want to be left to figure out the solution on our own which we will do eventually even if your help might have got us their quicker. The other aspect of it is even though we share a problem out of politeness its frustrating that you offer suggestion after suggestion in a somewhat random and arbitrary fashion almost in hope that one of which will be the solution our process may  look stubborn to you but your process is kindve infuriating to us when we didnt want an onslaught of extra confusion and the the sensory overload makes us lose our cool a little.

3923767,0,t3_356zk4,I am a jewellerjewellery designer in training and also run my own label whilst juggling a part time job in retail the least favourite part of my life but which was necessary in terms of making some sort of regular income but Im really trying to make this jewellery thing work out so that I can finally leave the horrid world of retail. Ive always loved to create things and be imaginative. Making jewellery is a time consuming and laborious activity and although it can be physically tiring the most appealing part of the work is being able to sit there for hours by myself and quietly concentrate on very intricate details. Besides making jewellery I also love to draw  which is an activity that is really similar in nature  I get the same feelings when I do both  Im very in the zone and am really happy to be sitting there quietly working on something for a long period of time and seeing the piece from start to finish.Its interesting to relate it to being an INFJ  a personality type who enjoys taking care of people and things who likes to put a lot of time and be attentive to one thing. I also rarely have to speak to people because the work itself is meant to be done independently behind a work bench with tiny tools and materials.When I finish a piece it makes me feel like Ive created a very tiny living thing and imagining whose hands it will land in gives me a lot of satisfaction. Theres an idealistic element to it as well as a physically and emotionally satisfying feeling to it. I love knowing the history of the jewellery industry and how it crosses cultures and time. I like to imagine the pieces lasting through generations and become important artifacts to people I will never live to meet. ,infj,cr3jn7m,2,t5_2r39a

3963921,0,t3_35sm3w,Sigh I know. And how embarrassing is it when it happens in front of other people? Who wants to be the person who doesnt have a plan for their future? Not us especially...we seem so capable of intuiting where everyone else is and what everyone else should do. You want to seem so sure of yourself so passionate about SOMETHING and you just want to have an answer when people ask you that Godforsaken question...and obviously when you ask yourself. Heres what Ive figured out. There are  of  ways you can deal with this question when it comes from other people . Just be honest. Its ok to say I honestly dont know right now. I havent gotten to a place where I feel passionate enough about any one thing or area to confidently says its what I want to do. Youre figuring it out and thats ok because you probably want whatever it is you end up doing to be meaningful and if it takes time to find it then what could be more worth it? How could that possibly be something to be ashamed of? . Have an autoresponse or  different ones. Im considering joining the Peace Corps... Ive really been thinking about going back to school to obtain my masters in ...You know I would love to become a pilot...etc. Have fun with it. And if they ask you again in  months its ok to have a different response because you know what? Frankly most of the people who ask you arent going to remember or arent going to care about however inconsistent you may be. And the ones that genuinely care about your future plans are the ones you can be honest with I dont know yet. In fact these could also be the people who shed light on your unique qualities the things youre naturally good atbetter at because well they come naturally to you. Utilize those people! They love you.Meanwhile the issue remains that you dont know yourself. How do you discover the things you like? You do them. How do you know what things to do? You do them all. What if you hate something? GOOD! Everything you dislike reveals just as much about your personality. Do. Everything. Volunteer. Do not shrug something off because you just know you wouldnt enjoy it. No. You dont know because youve never done. DO IT and see! And do it optimistically and shamelessly.  ,infj,cr84cdo,3,t5_2r39a

Years later I picked up a job at a restaurant and while others found the work difficult I found it a cakewalk compared to working at fast food. It turns out the growth is in the appreciation one can hold coming out the other side the character one then owns to appreciate how far theyve come. So in your case theyre looking to you to be their go to person but I think theres more personal growth to that then youre realizing in constantly having to be that girl that can get things done. I think networking while youre being invaluable for these entrepreneurs can help you longrun wherever you choose to go if youre going to be running your own practice or starting your own business as their success is your success.

I took philosophy of ethics a couple of years ago and really enjoyed the class ended up getting an A and we discussed things like this all the time so let me respond and give you some insight.gtEvil and its opposite do not exist.For this to have any sound meaning you have to first define what is evil or else the whole discussion is pointless.gtMost people are overwhelmingly awful at making optimal decisions.Most people? why is this? you would need to back this up.gtWhat you call evil is not a property of their selves but is actually a property of their decisions. So what is the self then? Who is the one that is making the evil decision then if it isnt them? This isnt philosophically sound.gtGoodEvil actions are never inherently goodevil but dependent on perspectiveSo you are an Individual Moral Relativist?gtAre you a soldier fighting overseas and your buddy just got killed? The other guy is evil. Are you instead the killer? Him and his buddy are evil.According to Utilitarianism the ones who produce the greatest amount of happiness is the ones who are doing the good.

So I dont automatically believe a humanist bent is in conflict with an investment career.  Its just going to be about who your clients are who you work for whats the result of the money youre investing etc.  So for example if you help a widow organize her finances to ensure a decent retirement that has meaning. I know thats a really basic scenario but its what Im getting at.I dont think INFJs are miscast in business but like with everything dammit we just have to dig a little bit to get to the right placeformulation to feel good about it since having meaning amp harmony in our lives is a driving force.

4549280,0,t1_ct3hs19,I shared this article because of some comments on the article on empathy from the NYT.  Grazianos theory of consciousness is based on attention.  Whats missing from the article is the role of awareness.  We have awareness of the attentional states of othersbasically we can perceive and reconstruct the attentional states of others.  We can also perceive this awareness emanating from others if you will.  You can sort of understand consciousness as the ability to turn attention and awareness on yourself giving rise to the feeling of selfawareness.  In this feeling we perceive our own rich complex inner worlds and localize them as emanating from within ourselves.  The thing I love about it is that my image of myself my image of other people my image of the world are all useful but inherently incomplete models that I store access and update in my mind.  The models are changeable and can be improved.  To me this is freeing and comforting.,infj,ct426wc,1,t5_2r39a

Remember the wedding is a day no matter how it goes if you are married at the end of it you succeeded.

We have different tastes in hobbies and music but our values sync up quite nicely. Aside from both of us being reclusive by nature we tend to balance each other out in most areas.gtbut lately Ive been thinking about what a retard I am and I dunno if INFJs will be havin thatTo be completely honest I dont think many will be havin that regardless of type. If its very obvious in your interactions that youre insecure youre not going to attract many. Common interests is generally important when dating but confidence is also key. Try and at least act like youre selfassured. Actual selfassurance will follow based on achieved result. You said this girl is interested in you so youre already halfway there gtNo offense I just realize as I get older Im never growing out of my messiness so I probably need to figure out what kind of person is a good match.I wouldnt assume this person isnt a good match for you just because youre messy.

Having a journal or even making quick notes on your phone to come back to is an excellent way of making the most of your thoughts and ideas.I used to have a notebook where I wrote about thoughts ideas and feelings I still have it and read through it somewhat often as a way of dealing with negative thoughts but also as a way to elaborate on and solidify thoughts and ideas.Making the decision to write down your thoughts and ideas about life will give life to them in the sense that they are not pushed down but rather brought upwards. Its vital that you express yourself adapting to this method will probably make you more willingbrave to share in the future and if not you can just journal.

So instead of jumping out and rejecting other ideas Ive learned to rephrase things. Ive learned to ask questions rather than state what comes to mind. This helps in professional environments where if someone knows a person is an INFJ they have to reason with changes because we are able to accept new info but we need to understand why things are so they fit into our worldview. So while what you say above has some truth to it there are ways an INFJ can manage this defensiveness and turn it into a strength and I dont see a lot written about that. The INFJ needs to learn to catch themselves and ask questions rather than be dismissive so they are not come off so much perceived as being evil on a warpath to defend their worldview.,infj,cu2vja5,1,t5_2r39a

Sensors are more straight forward and concrete so dont really get all in their own heads about the much heavier things in life. Ive noticed that they dont like to dwell on this area of vulnerability on a regular basis as INFJs do. The mark of a true deep relationship for me as an INFJ has always included being emotionally vulnerable. But this is not really the default for sensors that are thinkers. You the OP will have to be the part in the relationship that sends up the signal first and shows an open vulnerable hand.

But I think I figured it out I moved to a city without knowing anybody and have been slowly making friends but havent made any great friends or connections because its hard for me. Since the move Ive noticed I have a hard time putting sentences together and finding the right words. It almost feels like a stroke because its scary how I cant recall simple words. I become the most awkward person in the room.When I go home to see familyfriends or they come out to see me Im back to my normal self and can hold a conversation easily! Im funny smart and confident again. And thats what I realized its confidence. Moving and not connecting with people easily must have stripped me of my confidence and now I second guess everything I say. Im working on it... I know that if I can really connect with at least one person out here and foster that relationship I can get back to seeming like a normal person. Good luck! Its tough.

Because we tend to think before speaking we think others speak with intention and sincerity.  However the truth is that there are a lot of people who just blurt out whatever pops into their head no matter how thoughtless or blunt.

They often dont think theyre offensive because they are not easily offended.Its hard I know not to take things personally.  However try to assume its not about you.

5467982,0,t3_3pq3so,I was the supervisor of a shift of people in a high risk job where decisions literally meant life or death at times not to sound overly melodramatic and as an INFJ this wore me down to the point where I had nearly  months off work on stress leave last year.  Ive done a lot of courses on leadership and management and the thing that worked best for me as a control freak also was to delegate tasks but have the person come back to you as soon as the task is completed so you can review it and make sure its what you want.  It helps us INFJs to have that high level control over what is going on.  I used to do everything myself until I realised not only did it wear me out but my staff resented the fact that I did and felt I didnt trust them.My advice in the long run is .... dont be a leader.  Be an advisor to a leader.  Were far more creative and see things outside the box.,infj,cwal44x,1,t5_2r39a

5524388,0,t1_cwhpy8h,gtIts a function where ones evaluations are based on the emotionalethical premises that the Fe user interacts withI agree but to add to that and clarify my statement on Fe I believe that Fe especially with Ni gets its evaluations from the collective as I gave an example of in the OP. So sure in a broad sense Fe may have been interacting with people who blamed immigrantsjews for their misfortune but in an even broader sense Fe still knows core truths. However as you went on to explain Hitler spent time in jail which could explain the Fe going haywire NiTi loop etc. I definitely see what you mean. This was a very good explanation. Just to be clear I wasnt implying that INFJs are the good guys. Its plain that every type has good and bad people in it.However I didnt really see any evidence about why Hitler didnt use Te just that his Fe was under developed and under used. Isnt possible that he could have been in an NiFi loop? That he started indulging Te to unhealthy amounts? You even mentioned Bobby Fischer was in an NiFi loop.I guess Im asking for evidence that He used Fe not Te and Ti rather than Fi.

5568692,0,t3_3re5tw,I think theres a difference being in touch with emotions vs. in touch with ones personal emotions.  Im constantly taking in emotional data from the world around me what Im reading watching experiencing etc. I can feel them and experience them but they arent mineIm just borrowing them for awhile. Remove the stimulus and the feeling will fade although it can resonate.  After doing this for a lifetime its easy to recognize the nuance of feelings like a sommelier with wine. There are some I can get drunk from but for the most part I appreciate the range and complexity of the human experience and understanding those feelings helps me understand others better.  But there is a cost. An incredibly emotionally charged environment can make me really on edge and want to be by myself for awhile. When it comes to my own emotions that Im generating myself thats a completely different story. The command and nuance is gone and Im just wrestling with pure feeling that Im not sure how to define or contextualize. I have to think about those very hard to figure out whats going on and I often dont like it. I tend to take a mental approach to my own feelings and an empathetic approach to the feelings of others and my environment.Perhaps this is the reverse for INFPs who have an incredibly rich inner emotional life which they can then use to extrapolate how another might be feeling compared to their own personal experiences. I think INFPs are actually a lot more genuinely warm because their emotional temperature doesnt fluctuate with their environment like ours does.,infj,cwncibw,31,t5_2r39a
5569017,0,t3_3rc976,Youre on the right track on a few parts. For example masters have failed before. Thats true.You just have to become aware of how human psychology works in this and having a defeatist approach is a loss from the start. I reckon you understand this already.Let me share a few secrets its just a bit I dont know everything yet as Im still learning as well but just to give you a few hints to get you into the right direction. Because of our DNA we are programmed to be afraid of rejection because in ancient times it would most likely mean we die. Being cast away from the group meant death. This is no longer true. So we know that now We dont die if we get rejected but it still feels as bad. Or at least the fear of it Another thing why were afraid to ask is because if she already has a boyfriend also in ancient times it could mean we get a huge rock crushing our skull and we would die... Again this is very very unlikely in these times. . You can train to get less and less negative effects by simply talking to as many people as you can every day. You can take several approaches Talk to the very first person you see that day no matter who it is just talk. Or go for a girl for her looks and talk to her. st approach is easier. Talk to at least  persons a day. And if you really find it hard  person a day. But make sure you keep it up everysingleday... This way you train your brain that it is indeed NOT dangerous. You actually have to train your brain real hard before it will recognize its okay. Its of course not only your brain its also reflected in your body. You will eventually get more and more confident and thus more relaxed making it easier and easier. But a very important disclaimer here If you neglect to do this for  or  days you lost what you had built up. It takes around  months AT LEAST to make this experience more ingrained in your system. Consider that you are basically overwriting Ancient DNA fears that have been built upon generation after generation! That cant be overwritten overnight!. Exercise. You will look better. Feel better more healthy. It boosts confidence. It gives you better posture. You will be less in the mind your inner slavedriver and criticism and more in your body. Some variety is even better. I currently do a bit of fitness with weights some yoga and actually quite a few other things.On a sidenote People tell so often Well its what is on the inside that counts! Yeah... But really? Really really? We all like good looks. It certainly helps to take care of it. You will also feel better about yourself because you actually care about your looks. You care for yourself. Besides we all love aesthetics whether we admit it or not.. On that note I would actually say dancing is very good as well. You dont have to dance for someone else all the time. Just dance for yourself. It helps align your mind your heart and your body especially your sexual centre. You will become more aware of the actual importance of this gtwhenlt this actually gets more aligned. You need to notice the difference. Move a lot give attention to all your body parts. Thought it doesnt matter HOW you move if you dance for yourself just really dance the way you want toHowever when you dance to impress a girl do Exactly the opposite of trying to impress her. Being laidback less Oh I want you so bad I would do anything for you. Make her work for you rather you for her... Its just how the psychology works you know. If you work for her it makes her think youre not very important. Its really messed up but thats how it works.. Cut away all thoughts that do not serve you. Be very serious and real about this. How the hell does it help anyone that you think low of yourself? Every single person on this planet deserves the most optimal life. Its one of the biggest lies out there that for some people to be happy for some twisted altruistic form of reasoning you have to be less. Thats BSfirst class. Go be happy with or without reason.Use the mirrorneurons in your brain actively if you smile you will become happy. If you frown you become unhappy thats how the neurons work. It also works when seeing other people if you smile they are very likely to smile.There are so many things I could talk about but Ill keep it at this for the moment.  I hope it helps in whatever way!Oh last but not least kind of a rehash but you dont have to be a good dancer to get the girl. The guys who get most girls arent the guys who try to impress on the dancefloor.,infj,cwndymu,2,t5_2r39a

I understand the feeling of being too abstract for a therapist or having more knowledge than them. Dont worryThis can occur and it doesnt make you come off as egotistical.  All what it is really is that the therapist and you arent the right fit.May I ask if you tried to talk to your current therapist about this?    Client feedback is always appreciated amongst good therapists even though it feels intimidating for the client to speak up.  Your therapist may not even be aware of how they are coming off.If a therapist is the right fit a client will feel better after leaving the session. You will feel heard validated and feel like you are making gains. Sure therapy will uncover some painful stuff.  But you will learn new ways of thinking and coping. If something doesnt feel right listen to it.   This is your time and your money.  You deserve to get the most out of it. ,infj,cxaw78f,1,t5_2r39a

5803828,0,t3_3uohsl,Ive often found that many enneagram s are probably INFPs mistyping as INFJs. Not to say thats always the case but many times it is. But to answer your question Id imagine an INFP  to be more dreamy emotional and in touch with their emotions. Id see them prone to mood swings know that theyre happening and just want to experience the emotion so do less to hide or stop the mood swings from happening. INFPs are quite empathetic so combined with the s romanticism I imagine theyd be drawn to books stories movies etc. They also enjoy the uniqueness and championing of the underdog and character development present in fictional works and the possibilities springing from such works. INFJ s on the other hand seem more reserved in a way almost with a  or ish flavor. They dont really feel like theyre in control of whats going on inside of them so they attempt to judgecontrolevaluate the external world instead or at least how they appear to the external world. They seem more melancholic in a flattype way rather than a Romantic type way. Not to say this is always the case but when extreme emotions happen for INFJ s theyll probably be confused afterward or feel that their extreme emotions are out of character for them. I think theyll also be more criticalsarcasticpassiveaggressive when theyre stressed whereas an INFP might go into full stubborncontrol mode.,infj,cxgipy8,6,t5_2r39a

Mostly I can tell the I from the E first and then I can tell the F from the T and fill in the blanks on S v. F by interacting with them.Where I get stuck mainly on Reddit of all places is that the fourth dichotomy is new to me and it doesnt really fit into my perceptions of Cognitive Type Theory. It was an addon. So...my brain can go Oh INF.... or EST for sure but then it puts up a wall. I can do it all day long in person with interactions and observation but on the internet typing externally is difficult.

A lot of sensors Ive met dont quite get that because theyre so focused with inthemoment sensation and they often lack the intuition to understand just how different people are. I guess if theres one thing Id like for them to understand its that who I am isnt an act.,infj,cy4xa56,4,t5_2r39a
5991056,0,t3_3xipl7,Growing up I used to feel different and I initially attributed this to being gay but at about  I realised that even within the community I didnt fit in either in fact I felt more uncomfortable and out of place in the gay community than anywhere else. Then when I found out I was an INFJ I understood whyAlthough I dont disparage it at all casual sex and drunkendrugaffected partying for hours every week is seriously not my thing. What I do disparage however is the many gay people I know whose entire personality revolves around their being gay and I cant stand the shallowness of that. As much as I hate to make generalisations I will anyway because its the truth. I do not connect to gay people whose identity is made up of sex being a bitch watching drag shows listening to shitty pop music talking about pointless vapid shit and being flamboyant. Im sure for some people this is just their personality but Im certain that for the majority its all a show and it is suffocating and creepy I would love to meet some other gay or bisexual men whose sexuality is just that  their sexuality and nothing else ,infj,cy4yihv,18,t5_2r39a

Why do we coddle them and tell them its not their fault when they dont? We dont do that for men. We hold men to ridiculously high moral standards when it comes to selecting a sexual partner while the woman is just expected to enjoy herself and feel empowered for having sex at all.

A note on happy lights for anyone who may be interested You dont have to spend mega bucks. If you dont needwant an LED you can pick up daylight CFLs for a couple bucks at your local grocery or big box store. GE is a common brand but any will do as long as its in the neighborhood of K color temperature. Can also use them to grow plants  basil in winter is fun.If you want something on a timer pick up a  timer when buying the bulbs.On the LED front Ive found that most  daylight LEDs just plain suck. Probably best to stick with the  fancier ones. Same K daylight range as well.EDIT the colorkelvin temp is usually printed on the package of the bulb.

Im sorry if Im nitpicking you though because while most religions arent Abrahamic most religious people are in an Abrahamic religion.Yes a lot of misunderstanding of the Genesis story. Also why the hell are people taking behavioral lessons from a creation story? Especially one where everyone is behaving badly? Oy vey.But while the interpretation you cited is definitely in vogue now its not necessarily the intended meaning. Ive heard that a valid translation of the Hebrew rib is also side. So when the Hebrew says that Eve was made from Adams rib it could also be saying that Eve was made from Adams side or Adam was split into two. IIRC in the Hebrew the he pronoun is only used in reference to Adam after this split.My aunt is writing her seminary paper on an egalitarian interpretation of the creation story and I am looking forward to reading it. Theres actually a fuckton there that Christian tradition has ignored.Edit Its so weird reading over my comment.

6574955,0,t3_45ords,First off dont listen to uTalkingBackAgain Im going to guess hes never actually set foot in this city and has absolutely no idea what hes talking about.Okay so I dont know if Im breaking your boards policy because while I havent taken the MBTI in a while I know Im not an INFJ buuuuuuuut I have lived in Chicago for almost my entire life.  And when I say I have lived in Chicago I have actually lived and worked in the city proper Im not some twat suburbanite who says theyre from Chicago but turns out theyve only lived in the burbs like Naperville.So a couple things about the city.... Yeah there are a lot of people here.  That is pretty unavoidable its the third largest city in the country and the economic powerhouse of the Midwest.  You will eventually get used to the hustle and bustle but the thing I can tell you is that . of the people you see will not care about you.  Like I see hundreds if not thousands of different people everyday even the crazy ones basically dont get put into memory any more at this point.  There are just too many of them there is a true anonymity to being in a crowd.  Youre just one face in a sea of people.. The violence here is overhyped.  Okay yes it is a very large city that does have some real issues with crime that I could write about forever but the really scary crazy shit the persistent gang and gun violence that makes headlines across the country is largely contained to specific parts of the city and contained within small networks of people who know each other  Im not trying to say that random acts of violence dont happen to unfortunate people this is still a city and you have to respect it can be dangerous and be careful but the really intense war zonelike violence is just not a universal thing here.  Ive lived here for almost  years and the only times I have ever heard a gun were at the shooting range far outside the city limits.Without knowing your budget and needs for a place to live I cant be much help there but I will say that if you plan to commute downtown every day of the week I would highly recommend looking into living somewhere near a train station.  There are two completely different train systems the CTA Chicago Transit Authority which runs the famous L trains that circle the Loop and the subway system and the Metra which is a commuter rail system that primarily serves the suburban areas around the city.  I personally live in the city walking distance from the Blue Line and ride it to work in the Loop everyday and I love it.  Driving here is in my opinion soul crushing.  I hate driving I havent owned a car in almost a decade and as long as I work downtown I see absolutely no reason to buy one.That said I get that public transit can be intimidating at first.  And depending on where exactly you want to live and how much you want to spend.  If you want to live in the city Lakeview or Lincoln Park are a pretty traditional spot for transplants I would say almost everyone who lives there is not from Chicagoland originally and from either downstate Illinois or the Midwest.  That said its very dense lots of people and parking is a nightmare.  If you want to live closer to the city Downtown River North the West Loop and the South Loop are all very popular residential neighborhoods with a number of large luxury apartment towers or cool converted industrial lofts.  Since many of the residential buildings are also pretty new getting some kind of offstreet or garage parking is usually easier though it can be expensive.  Finally if youre looking for a neighborhood that is still in the city but a little quieter and a little less heavily populated places like Lincoln Square Ravenswood North Center Roscoe Village Wicker Park Bucktown or Irving Park are all on the NorthNorthwest Side and are safe near public transit and traditional residential neighborhoods.  If youre lucky you might be able to get a reasonably sized deck patio or yard space.  It can be hit or miss a lot of the housing out here is older so sometimes youll find a beautifully maintained or renovated building and sometimes youll find a shithole.  Gotta do your homework.I dont know the suburbs as well but again if youre looking at coming into downtown Chicago everyday I would highly recommend a town near one of those Metra stations.  Im telling you unless you have wits of steel you will not want to sit in stop and go traffic twice a day five times per week.  The Metra is also probably a little less intimidating to start with because its really designed for other downtown office workers.  Commuters only really very few kids going to school homeless people sleeping or beggars asking for money.Oh yeah thats another thing there are a lot of homeless people who spend a lot of time on the CTA L or around downtown asking for money.  Dont be afraid to tell them you dont have any cash. Almost all of them arent looking for any trouble.  Dont give them cash many of them are obviously looking to scrape together enough money for drugs or alcohol.  If you really feel obliged to help I usually carry a couple of granola bars in my bag and offer them to people when I can.  Many of them take it some of them dont.I dont really have good advice on getting over your general anxiety about city life.  Like I said Ive lived here for my entire life I absolutely love it and cant really imagine living anywhere other than a big city.  My wife was raised in the very far suburbs and never really came to Chicago until we moved here a few years ago.  She also had some anxiety issues but she worked her way over them because I would force her to go out and experience things and eventually living here really grew on here.  There are a million things to do here we have some of the worlds best cultural institutions some of the countrys finest restaurants some of the best live theater outside of New York dozens of microbreweries a milelong lakefront park that is amazing in the summer thousands of concerts in every genre of music imaginable and dozens if not hundreds of neighborhoods full of interesting people quirky shops and cafes and quite literally almost anything you can imagine.  I love it here this is a fantastic place to live.  And if youre from Minnesota then youre already prepared for the only thing that sucks about here winter.So the best advice after all that I can probably say is if you choose to live in Chicago try and embrace it.  Dont be dumb dont rush into things too quickly but dont be afraid to challenge your comfort zone a little bit either.,infj,czzekuf,5,t5_2r39a
6582040,0,t3_45sbg3,I did some scribbling in high school but I started my first serious journal in my freshman year of college and looking back I can honestly say that it was one of the best choices I made.

But dont let your perfectionism hold you back! It really doesnt matter what it looks like so long as the things you put in it are honest.My journals started off as a collection of quotes and song lyrics I collected then slowly morphed into some semblance of a narrative.

They can also analyze almost anything but do tend to fail a bit when it comes to certain emotional analysis at least my INTJ friends and S.O. sometimes do.

As a family unit we have a lot of shared qualities and a similar way of interacting with the world but when you break down the motivations by person you can really see the difference in the thinking. NFs in general tend to have a unique interpretation and approach to the world and whether its through Fes adaptability or Fis individualism it can be hard to get a clear understanding of who they are. Its funny when you get a bunch of them together how that particular quirk can then become part of the culture of the family unit as a whole.

6663333,0,t3_46u45u,HiIm a trauma survivor INFJ and a therapist. I can say that trauma survivors have a tendency to shut down when they feel like someone is lecturing them. Its just a natural response that we learn from trauma. We freeze cant express ourselves and feel like were at the other persons mercy.  What works for me is having someone ask me to write my thoughts down or giving me time when Im ready to communicate. I also like being asked questions gently and kindly. Unfortunately every trauma survivor goes at their own pace. Things dont happen overnight.  I have had people try to hurry me up or fix me and it pushed me away from them. I actually dumped an ex and a few friends for this very reason. I dont like it when someone is trying to cure me.  Im  a lot happier when someone can just respect my process and be supportive.  Just be my friend or intimate partner.  I will respect my partner more when he sees me as a functioning and capable adult.It possible that maybe this isnt a good match but I dont know you or your gf. I only know based on my experience with trauma survivors.  Many trauma survivors want a patient and understanding partner that is aware that trustconfidence is going to be a lifelong journey for us. We are going to have our good days and bad days with our healing.  The best gift one can give is reassurance and listening.  If I think my partner is going to break up with me I would like him to just tell me that its not the case.  Im not saying youre not understanding or patient. Just letting my thoughts out here. If someone is frustrated with me I dont want to be with them. Even my own sexual attraction towards them shuts off.Good luck with everything. ,infj,d08jntt,5,t5_2r39a

So Atheists at least in some sense have their own religion.  Old Buddhist monks had the smallest responses of anyone studied.  Had a really great discussion with my friend as I mentioned.  She is highly spiritual and I asked her if she could live forever if she would.

INFJs can see immature ENTPs as superficial and fake just not worth their time. ENTPs probably see INFJs as overly vigilant and stubborn.But if ENTPs quit rough housing for a second and open up a little bit we will realise there is a whole lot more depth there.I think INFJs and ENTPs tend to put on a faade of closedmindedness when we really are very openminded  to the point of amorality and disobedience of accepted norms in certain cases. Its not common for the INFJ or ENTP to come across other divergent thinkers people are often stuck in their ways or  if they are openminded  just dont give a shit anyway.Over time Ive accepted that most people dont change their minds easily so Im not going to waste my energy or risk upsetting others unless Im sure youre willing to listen and discuss with civility.,infj,d16elps,3,t5_2r39a

I think what most people are saying here is something along the lines of there are different kinds of knowledge so no one is really more knowledgeable than anyone else. I could theoretically know everything about mathematics but if I got stranded on an island I might not know how to survive. There are also different kinds of intelligence. Some people can learn things faster and more indepth than others and apply those things to their advantage. If you happen to be one of those people who has aboveaverage intelligence then by definition the average person will not understand certain things as indepth as you do and will also be unable to pick up on new ideas as quickly.

7038280,0,t3_4bzjvq,Not to go off topic but just wanted to say that.. I do think its totally normal for someones attachment style changing... not just as they grow oldetc but with each different person. I feel this way because you feel differently about each person. They way you feel about your parents who raised you from the beginning till youre an adult and know that no matter what theyll be there for you  about your friends you can have one or two really close friends and a few more just friends  even events in yourtheir lives can change the relationship and how you feel about eachother your SO you know you can trust them and tell them things you dont even tell your best friendparents  but overtime even this can change...and etc. The point is everyone is different and they mean differently to you and that feeling will last forever or change overtime. Your mind calibrates itself based on the these external changes as youthey live yourtheir lives. You can feel anxious with one SO and secure with another if the other didnt work out.Change is constant because you dont have control over anything..except maybe your mind.

7198152,0,t1_czftw0m,Absolutely true. The trick is to keep yourself motivated I guess. I was on the fence because I was concerned about which path would more likely get me to the person I wanted to be. But something I realised is that your career doesnt define you you define your career. I just need to develop the courage to defy certain norms in a commerce career should I ever face those instances.I feel like I have to clarify this. Being female is an important factor because Im originally from a third world country heavily involved in cronyism racial discrimination and gender discrimination. I havent decided for sure if Im going back to work there but Id very much like to keep it in my options as my family are there. If youre from America or any Western country you will not believe the idiotic shameful things that are allowed to happen in my country. Going back there in a traditionally maleoriented job would most probably defeat the purpose of sending me overseas to have an education in the first place to live a better life. Id very much like to change that in my own country perhaps by working overseas for years until I go back to work in a senior position and change things slowly. But what if my family members get sick? What if I cant go back home to actually take care of them because I need to provide for them financially especially if the medical bills are high? I cant compromise my family for a vision that may not even work. Id rather get a stable job back home that pays relatively well in the worst case scenario. I can be very anxious and that would really impact my quality of life.So I really believe that its just my circumstances and my priorities that have made me think this way. Its not that I dont believe females cant succeed in engineering  I deeply believe they can and they are  its about if I personally will be able to contribute to such a movement.Thank you for your message anyway!

I basically just followed my passion down that route. I wasnt really into making game art when I started because there are many limitations compared to cinematic production. After getting my animation degree I didnt really want to live in the hot bed areas for film California  Texas  Europe.I love the Northwest of USA and there are a lot of game industry companies here. It became an obvious choice to try to get a job doing that as I needed money and wanted to use my degree. I fell in love with the culture once I was in. Its a very small world industry where youre likely to run into people youve worked with before. Everyone is Kevin Bacon only better.As for the veterans and juniors the industry is very teamoriented and the projects last a while. Within a team theres always need for a few experts that understand the technology and can polishmentor the work of everyone else. In addition there is always a huge influx of new blood from schools looking to cut their teeth so juniors are hired for the more tediousrepetitive work. They gain industry experience and access to midlevel and veteran coworkers. Im at the upper end of midlevel now so I get mentored by the vets and get to pass down what I know to juniors.

I have gotten alot better with this nowadays and has just made me feel closer to and more grateful for those people in my life.You will so much better when you tell them that is my experience anyway!I would suggest having an organized timetable even though I hate them myself just so you can plan your work over time and then by the time it comes the deadlines it is less stressful. I know this piece of advice is abit late for your current situation but you can bear it in mind in the future.Unfortunately I think the only way youre going to overcome this problem is by facing it head on. If that means youre late handing in work then take responsibility for it but dont overthink and beat yourself up for it. You have to move on from this experience and promise yourself that you will try not to let it happen again.Hey we all like attention I find especially as introverts we recieve less attention so when we do get some we enjoy it even more. I know I enjoy attention to an extent so I wouldnt worry about it too much. But this something I can definitively relate to.Honestly I think youre just overthinking this it is something I do all the time as Im quite self conscious in some ways. At the end of the day overthinking often holds me back and I think this is what youre doing and it is just making you sound stressed.

7311279,0,t1_d28z6b7,I can totally relate to this. To be honest I didnt know this is a INFJ thing but now when I think of it it makes perfect sense.My hobbies tend to go too far even to the point that I have hard time enjoying them anymore after all the research and practicing I invest in them. I enjoy the ride but it does not always lead anywhere.And like meantioned this doesnt go well with drugs or other things addictive by their nature. Not to add that even though Im somewhat good taking care of others I seem to have much lower standards for myself when it comes to health. Basicly the story how I started to smoke regularly. Smoking momentarily reduces stress and makes me more comfortable with my surroundings when Im under pressure in distressing environment. After a while I start to like it and nothing in my brain tells to stop untill real addiction is generated. Maybe a bad example considering that might be how it works for pretty much everyone who smokes but for me this does not limit to smoking cigarettes but more like everything I like  everything Im addictedobsessed to.Relationships are the worst though. Obsession is obviously never healthy for either person in question. This is something I want to keep in mind in my next possible relationship.

7393371,0,t1_d2g6g39,Hey thank you for trying to explain. This is not your usual this weather eh? type of conversation. Its deep stuff that most people never truly talk about. gt To me idealism is essentially one of two things the ability to look past all that is bad and ugly in the world and see the good and beautiful things anywayI am not sure what my version of idealism is. I have always considered myself a realist. Give me the truth. Whatever it is. Pursuing the truth or the better truth given the circumstances has always been a life philosophy of mine. In that sense I do not think I have had that idealism that ignores the bad and sees only the good. I think I have had the former the one that looks past the bad and ugly and focuses on the good anyway.In that sense I would say I am an idealist thank you for illustrating the  categories. However I would say that I am more of a realist. I have called myself a hopeful realist. Not an optimist. Not rosecoloured glasses. Not nihilist. Not pessimist. Not naive. BUT and heres the big but I keep falling in the same whole. You would think that by now I am cured as I am not afraid of looking at the bad. The problem is that I hold other people to the same standards that I hold myself. Heres an example lies. I.do.not.lie.... at.all.  To me its simply not acceptable. and heres my mistake I expect the same of others.Thats a moral quality and in that I am stupidly idealistic. Why? because if I can do it why cant they? I could give other  examples not all moralistic. Work ethic intelligence ability to understand things effort authenticity the list is huge. gt Life happened so now I am forced to look the bad and the ugly straight in the face. I see it I know it I live it. And its hard. Its an unhappy and miserable way to see the world. I think this is a gorgeous quote of yours. Bravo. gt The kind of idealism that acknowledges the world and everything in it as ugly and impure and beautiful all the same.This is what I want as well. Thanks for putting words to that. gt I suppose what I want is an upgraded version of the idealism I once had. Idealism for GrownUps so to speakThat is my goal as well. The big question for me is how does one stop being stupidly idealistic even when one is already a realist?or am I deluded somewhere?,infj,d2iks7l,1,t5_2r39a

7422114,0,t3_4gxrsv,This is so true. Has happened to me in the past many times. Its another NiTi loop scenario. You use some good intuition to suss her out and form an idea in your mind of what shes like. But you dont insist on talking to her even to be nice etc so you skip the Extraverted Feeling function of our minds and now you skip straight to the introverted thinking. So now youve formed who she is in your mind and are always thinking about her possibitiy of being with her wondering what shed be like in different scenarios wondering how youll get along and really just enjoying these thoughts in your mind. Like a really nice dream. But...  Once you do meet her even talk for a bit. Certain features of her made up personality will change in your mind as you begin to paint the real picture of her. Get to know her even more find out what she likes she may be incredibly boring or just have no similarities. Your mind will then begin to paint the real her in your mind and youll probably start losing this obsession. Or she could be even more amazing than your version of her. This is how our mind works. Its amazing. Do some research on INFJ functional stack and this will all make sense. ,infj,d2lugpy,6,t5_2r39a

7614374,0,t3_4jjpls,I think in work situations a lot of it is down to confidence.

We have  people here for  minutes and youre telling a personal narrative about how difficult it was to get legal to sign off on this?  Irrelevant!  Or people will just want to make noise in meetings and demonstrate that they know things motherfucker I dont have time for your politics... i have work to do and redditing besides.  Is there a pattern or patterns to when youre being cut off?  Are you embellishing the story speaking slowly speaking without certainty?  Are you devoting a lot of speech to personal ish?  Are you approaching the topic of discussion from a point too removed from the thrust of conversation?  A problem that a lot of N doms have which I used to struggle with at work is that well start from the intuitive leap and work backwards to the topic at hand.  Most people cant follow this and you have to start at the topic and get to the insight.  ,infj,d37pqio,8,t5_2r39a
7617748,0,t1_d38254x,Well.. what I think is that I happen to engage my tertiary Ne a LOT. IT gives me an intuitive edge and Si can be very pattern forming on its own.Im theory crafting a lot of the time. I use the patterns I notice to craft elaborate ideas and theories.I make wild stories based off of what I observe and use them to fuel my imagination.Remember ESFJ is FeSiNeTi and a tertiary is like mental candy. Ones who are willing to explore such candy are well rewarded with a fun time using it. INFJs should in theory really enjoy using their Ti and pride themselves on it even if it isnt their primary function.MBTi doesnt work on scales like that. However each person has an intuitive function and a sensing function in their type. Technically when Im engaged I become sorta an ENTP. Your preference for each might be reflected in a percentage.Extroverted percievers and introverted judgers are about the purest forms of their types. They have their perceiving dominant and strongest and their opposite is inferior and underdeveloped.introverted percievers and extraverted judgers are more mixed. Extraverted types are even more so and when well developed can appear to be hybrids because of their well developed extroverted opposing function. extroverted functions are highly visable and thus why an ESFJ who loves her Ne can look very intuitive with being very imaginative and creative and an ENFJ who loves his Se can look very sensory with flashiness love of extreme stuff and impulsive acting.The problem is that you have to be willing to engage those functions and people use it differently.After all openmindednessintellect is only mediumhigh correlated with Sensing and intuition. I think the degree of openmindedness matters.Plus people just have different interests and that isnt relegated to type but just to behavior differences and exposure growing up. Interesting though Ni vs Ne. To you intuition is about the meaning of things and for me intuition is about generating ideas and possibilities that are often times very very abstract. I assign my meanings by Si instead. I guess differences in functions ,infj,d383jws,2,t5_2r39a
7621698,0,t1_d3825dn,gtYou are a brave woman to survive that.Thank you. We all do what we have to do to survive though. Id say the brave part is deciding to still be here trying to get better rather than long dead from suicide. Its incredibly hard to turn away from an end to pain and keep trudging along alone and in the dark with nothing but the faintest most fragile ember of hope to guide you. Frankly I have no idea how Im still alive but Im glad I managed to hang on.gtWhenever someone talks about their abuse unfortunately most of the time they dont mention the shame and the sense of believing they deserved itI cant speak for anyone but myself but I still struggle with it. Maybe others do too and thats why no one talks about it. I mean I know logically that I did nothing to deserve it and that I was really just unlucky to be born into the life I was. But the world still feels hostile to me and I struggle with a very strong sense of general inferiority or at least the strong expectation that others find me to be inferior. So Im hypervigilant of peoples facial expressions for the slightest sign of rejection whenever I leave the house because I expect to be despised on sight. I scan faces obsessively to spot the loathing I know Ill find in peoples eyes so I can steel myself for the everimminent onslaught of ridicule. The only difference is that now I dont think I deserve it so the blatant injustice of it hurts even more.It sounds stupid but just being in a position to be seen and thus judged by another human is so terrifying to me and so triggering of that old shame and belief in deserving my abuse that I avoid the situation at all costs. So I am not able to leave the house much. And that causes even more shame because what kind of worthless loser cant even leave the house?Anyway not everyone is like me but I would bet that there is a similar holdover  feedback loop in many people with an abusive upbringing.gtthey always sound certain that they always knew it was abuse.Hindsight is always . My abuser slowly upped the ante over time so I distinctly remember being confused when I felt it gradually crossing over into this is obviously wrong territory but still not being sure whether or not it was bad enough that anyone would care or if complaining about it just meant I was weak and deserving of even more ridicule.Even after I was out of the situation I didnt want to call it abuse for a long time because I felt like it probably wasnt bad enough to qualify which I can see now was totally absurd. I just called it a rough childhood because I felt like that was general enough to not step on any toes. It wasnt until I read a lot of legit psychology journal articles about child abuse that I really figured out that I have a right to call it abuse. And that made it a lot easier to understand my resultant mental illnesses which actually didnt just spring up from out of nowhere. This was another tactic used against me in the course of my abuse using my unstable mental state as proof that I was defective  that it was my fault that my craziness drove her to it that I deserved it.Anyway Im sure some people are probably lucid enough to realize its abuse while theyre still in the thick of it but I would assume the ones whose psyches were fucked with the most take a while longer.gtI think this is because they dont want to sound like they are wavering in their statement of the facts and dont want to give societypeople any reason to doubt them.Thats probably true. But then youve got lunatics on Tumblr screaming about being triggered by lack of social privilege or whatever and everyone hates them so much for making such absurd strident claims that I dont think it even matters what you say at this point. The water has been muddied beyond repair. If you publicly claim to have been damaged by any kind of hardship there always seems to be a tremendous wave of assholes claiming youre just making it up for attention andor trying to be a special snowflake. If anything the more you hedge and downplay the more likely people probably are to believe you at this point.gtThe Mask You Live InI would highly recommend that film to anyone who actually reads this far down.

I find the stick approach is extremely draining demoralizing and makes me think Why would I want to do anything for anyone who has this much antipathy towards me ? Are you my friend or foe ? I also think that people who use the stick approach dont have a good way of gauging whether it is in the persons ability to do the task that they want. I mean if someone was using the carrot approach its highly unlikely that if they werent getting results with a small carrot they would go for a gigantic carrot and keep getting bigger and bigger carrots if they continued not getting results in an effort to convince the participant however with a stick approach it seems like when people dont get results they keep going for a bigger and bigger stick possibly because they are getting frustrated or because of the urge to dominate and feel power. ,infj,d3v2mew,3,t5_2r39a

If Im just an acquaintance with someone who invites me out like that Im more likely to say no even though I enjoy spending time with that person in a group setting. Only my good friends who are perceivers can invite me like that AND get me out of the house to do them.Id try talking to her in person more so she feels safer hanging out oneonone with you. Im disregarding the daily onlinetalking as a sign of interest to be honest just because I think people are chattier and more casual about being chattier electronically. See her in person a lot even if its in a group setting. I think how verbally direct you are is going to be based on your comfort level and not hers. Cant speak for every INFJ but in my experience we appreciate candidness but will offer it right back to you. Be as verbally direct as you want just prepare for a direct answer back haha. Id hang back on being physically direct.Which brings me to the touching! For me the touching is hard to read without more details. Its confusing but I touch people Im interested in and people I have no interest in dating but am comfortable around. Bottom line once she feels comfortable with you shell want to spend oneonone time with you to talk if shes interested. Just keep spending time with her and see if she opens up. If she doesnt just sit down and be direct with her about your feelings and see what she says.,infj,d3ykdsj,5,t5_2r39a

You might never be and thats the truth ask me how I know.So finding another person whos like that with whom you have that bond... where you have the mental emotional and physical spiritual connection feels impossible however as youve said youve changed so who are you looking for now...?Like him but maybe who he could be... without the addiction issues maybe thats the guy.

But the city somehow wasnt completely destroyed after three years of constant bombing? What would there have been to bomb for three years straight? I mean there are pictures of the ruins left after the Soviets finally took the city and Berlin wasnt bombed for nearly as long. This is actually really simple. Nazi bombs were vastly inferior to allied bombs allied bombs were exponetially larger and more explosive than Nazi bombs.

Basically we have just had to accept that we cant do anything about it . . . she just cant see it as an issue it is part of who she is.So one option is to simply plan for your friend to be flakey. Realise beforehand that she will  be changing the plans at the last minute or not showing up. This way you can make your own alternative plans that you feel comfortable with and you might not get so put out.I have no advice for the fact that she makes everything about her . . . perhaps it would be best to try and find someone else to support you and see if she matures on her own in the meantime? ,infj,d4tgl28,1,t5_2r39a

8141722,0,t3_4qnrau,Theres no straight answer here.The main reason is because becoming interestedattracted to someone is easya single good and in depth conversation is enough to make me start thinking about someone.Actual attraction to me is like a switch I go from having interest to being attracted almost without warning. Once that line is crossed thats it... the person has me if she wants me. This is actually a bit of a sticky situation because it seems like most people lose interest once the chase is over and I cant hide my feelings so that tends to be that.I cant say that Ive ever fallen in true love before though Ive dated women and had strong feelings for a few. I dont think any woman was truly in love with me though so by default I dont think I could have felt true love eitherit has to go both ways in my mind.So instead I guess the best way I can answer this is that I recognize that a woman is someone I can love in a very intricate way. Its almost like the emotions are roots digging deeper into me. Once they get deep enough they have covered more of my inner workings than not.

If someone like my boss or a teacher asks me to do something I will nearly always say yes even if I really dont want to do it Im talking about extra responsibilities not my actual job.Choosing a place to eat out or something is ok though I would just pick somewhere that I knew everyone including me liked. I also make sure that I weigh in on group decisions especially if I know Im not going to like what they decide on. I mean I would never make my friends eat food they dont like so why should I eat food that I dont like? This is obviously simplified but you see my point  you have to consider yourself an equal part of the group. To be honest I am surprised by how little this bothers other people but then I remember they want me to enjoy what we are doing and they have other friends to do the activities I dont want to do. Im not the center of their universe so who cares if I dont want to go watch the newest romcom? Do I get pissed off that they dont want to watch scifi? No I dont care!The thing is that you know you can do what you want but you feel guilty afterwards. So I would suggest finding a way to stop the guilt. Perhaps you can ask your friends to remind you that they had a great time doing what you wanted? Or sit down and meditate for ten minutes and clear the emotional slate so to speak.

Do you feel like you are somehow obligated to forgive and forget before shes gone?

Ns seldom apologize and more seldom mean it. But I think I understand your situation.

I would say something likeYou will not achieve success professionally unless you achieve happiness personally first. The best way to be a good leader is to show your subordinates that you care about them. Respect their personal needs even if those personal needs conflict with their work. This will earn respect motivation loyalty and a lifelong desire to deliver for you. Ask the three magic questions on a regular basis  What do you want to do more of?  What do you want to do less of?  How can I help?Think in terms of systems and always get to root causes of problems. Promote a culture of trust and positivity where others feel free to share their ideas on how to make systems they work within more effective and efficient. Your subordinates will often have the answers before anyone above them.Always start with a clear vision of what your end aim but be flexible in the path to reach that aim. Ensure all in your team understand contribute to and buy into this vision. Eat well. Sleep enough. Exercise. You will always be below your best if any of these falters. Never ask anyone to do anything you would not do yourself. Dont be afraid to apologize. Show others that you recognize when you have made a mistake and that you learn and improve from your errors and are willing to listen and change. If you get frustrated or if others get frustrated it is time to take a break. Pause assess then reengage. Be a good man,infj,d5grz61,6,t5_2r39a

I get nervous and overthink things and stop acting like myself which makes me both less likely to attract anyone bc being nervous then looks like instability or to attract the wrong person for me bc I am not being myself. Whereas if I just meet someone doing my thing and they catch my interest I can actually just let things evolve without getting paralyzed. So it seems to me if I can find the overlap of things I naturally do with places this type is likely to be I have decent odds of meeting one in a way that wont make me torpedo any chance and also wont cause me stress and upset just by attempting it.,infj,d5nph5s,7,t5_2r39a

8379640,0,t1_d5oyi5z,We do! Sometimes if were lucky well knowfind someone in the area who can give us recommendations or even go so far as to help us with arrangements. But most of the time its just up to us to do our research and figure things out. We usually book locations through Airbnb or VRBO and often times the hosts are super duper helpful in answering any questions we might have. The rental property often plays a large part in what other things we do as it can be difficult to find a place thats within budget large enough to host  people and also aesthetically appealing. We focus mostly on food and lifestyle photography so a photogenic residence is kind of a necessity. Once we have that booked well try to find some neat things in the area to do since we like to do a couple outings per event. Lonely Planet in particular is one of my favorite resources for this.As far as getting people to sign up for the event we do our primary promotion on our instagram accounts as well as through blog posts and a mailing list from our site.  My friend is a wellknown food blogger and has a pretty big instagram following so the primary signups are her followers. I used to be a blogger as well but thats fallen to the wayside in the past couple years. All in all these things are a TON of work especially because we cook all of the meals ourselves as well but super fun!,infj,d5p0556,1,t5_2r39a

8413048,0,t3_4ur9yo,Yes. One so far. She has  years on me. Our timing was just bad in many aspects when the door was open  years ago. It started with me helping her recover from the aftermath of NPD parenting. Eventually we turned into best friends and were becoming more. But she wasnt mentally healthy at the time due to that baggage from her childhood and it made me unsure about things even though I felt the chemistry. I was also a bit insecure due to a long running string of layoffs and my own baggage from an NPD parent that I wouldnt become aware of until recently as a year ago. The insecurity clouded my feelings and judgment.  Being the INFJ I am and insecure at the time I decided it was better to keep things to just friends and make sure I could give her the chance to recover from the aftermath of her childhood. Rather than risk entering into something that was a mistake and destroy that chance for her to recover. Eventually she mellowed enough to meet somebody else that is also a good person and I was happy for that. But as time has went on Ive come to realize I made a mistake when I held our relationship back.  Our friendship still persists to this day as a nightly thing. But we maintain our geographical distance and keep it online only. Cause we both admit our feelings far surpass just friends. A mistake wouldnt be worth ruining what we do have and hurting everyone else involved in the process.  Obviously Id go for it. But that door will probably stay closed.,infj,d5t6avv,1,t5_2r39a

I hated my old employer so much I went through all manner of emotional pain just to walk through the door. Id get there a half an hour early and peptalk myself into showing up. There were quite a few days where sitting behind the building in my car I called off and just went home. They paid very well so much so that I had a hard time finding another local job where the pay would be competitive. And if I didnt have my fiancee grandmother and sisters relying on me financially I would have quit for a lower paying job.Send out resumes quietly. Look for ways to make a career change into something youll enjoy. It might takes you months of looking to find something but once you do you can focus all your energy on it.And dont sell your transferable skills short.

8772773,0,t3_507ejz,I am an INTJ Male dating an INFJ female and it is easily the best relationship I have ever had past Relationships being with an ESFP several INFPs an ENTJ and another INTJ. As a disclaimer I should state that I believe I have a highly developed Fi so I do not necessarily fit the INTJ stereotype of being out of touch with my emotions so my perspective could be skewed bear that in mind. Anyway the positives mostly come down to shared Ni. We are both long range planners and have really meshed well with our plans for our futures. We are at our best when we are envisioning together whether that be career decisions planning for a trip or just our daily schedule. We have a lot of truly wonderful conversations about the world and philosophy and whatever. Our physical chemistry is great we rarely fight and we share a lot of common interests in the places where it matters most. She is extremely kind and supportive and backs me in every decision I make as well as encourages me to think more empathetically. She has also helped me to improve my Se by suggesting I pay more attention to what is going on around me something I have been terrible at. On the flip side it can sometimes be difficult to handle how sudden her emotions seem to hit her and it often feels like a struggle to try and keep myself from saying anything that will offend her. The one place we consistently disagree is on social norms for example in her current living situation she always wants to give parts of the things we cook to her roommates before we have eaten whereas I believe we should eat our fill first and then share what is left over. I also sometimes get with how much she consorts with people she hates because she is incapable of just telling them she does not like them. Ultimately I feel like the good outweighs the bad and her and I are moving in together shortly after a long period of dating. While there are some problems I really think this pairing is a great one and would highly encourage it. However keep in mind Personality type is never a one hundred percent predictor.

8912697,0,t1_d7j1mli,I dont think you can define hypersensitivity. Its just to subjectively universal in that one definition would conflict with another and so on. I just simply see it as a term that has different meanings depending on the point of reference you use. Its like trying to define happiness or the truth or having everyone come to one conclusion on a piece of abstract art or a song. Individuality has too strong a subjective pull on the nature of certain ideas and concepts that trying to holistically define or understand them would be like trying to comprehend infinity. The most you could hope to do is concoct some heavily convoluted web of different understandings of an idea but even then I have a feeling that the general consensus of all these subjective terms would just simply lead back to the broad dictionary definition. Its so easy to dictate the proper level of sensitivity between a person and a computer because that computer has no say its programmed to do what we what it to do. Then we are instructed to interface with it to the degree that was intended. If these machines had individuality then it wouldnt be so easily defined it would then just be a mechanical mirror of your current interpersonal conundrum. Instead of trying to find the prefect broad understanding of a universal terms I would say that people just need some perspective. Try to understand where someone is coming from subjectively to understand their truth because when we can all understand eachothers truths theres no longer any real need for definitions. ,infj,d7j6c8n,1,t5_2r39a
8914925,0,t3_52d9f3,Yep. The worst part is when I meet new people such as when I started my current job . years ago I go out of my way to be friendly and wear a smile even though its not natural for me and can be exhausting. So when I feel comfortable letting that facade go and just wearing my normal to me neutral but apparently to others coldslightly melancholy expression I get asked all the time if Im okay. People assume Im upset when Im not because Im not as cheerful as I used to be even though Im actually happier overall than I was back then.The other side of this is that in early efforts to be friendly I come across as way more extroverted than I actually am. I met my boyfriend of a year and a half at work and he was surprised when the topic of introversion came up because he INTJ thought I was an extrovert.

Id like to know if this is something other INFJs can relate to. Any sort of help or insight would be appreciated.A telltale sign of being influenced in my book is a change in behaviors that cause consequences. Mirroring someone only involves superficial changes. Ive found that INFJs mirror as a way to identify with those around them to promote harmony. And mature Fe strives to harmonize on things that can be genuinely harmonized with. So while INFJs may seem to be changing constantly based on who theyre around they really are only projecting parts of themselves are really there which just happen to harmonize with those currently around them. Ideally of course! Im not saying its not possible for immature Fe to get itself into some troublesome areas. It is COMPLETELY possible.Now it took me a LONG time to figure that out. And I know as a teenager I definitely did not understand this about myself. Id say as far as telling the difference the guideline I talked about earlier changing nonsuperficial behaviors is a good start.

What you said makes a lot of sense because I feel this anxiety bubbling up whenever I have to do something involving a lot of people or people I dislike with no easy escape route.

9149492,0,t3_55c0tf,I relate with most of the posts here on rinfj but reading this actually made me feel worse. It seemed condescending whether or not it was intended that way  which most likely it was not.It was as if another person was saying you might as well give up because you only got half way through and will never be good enough  so just do yourself a favor and give up and accept that alrighty. While I strongly agree that perfection is not attainable in anything and that there is ALWAYS room to improve and learn something new  to me it is still important that one strive for perfection in anything that they try  whether or not it is reached thats not the point. I believe that people should put in the proverbial  into everything that they do  be it work family and so on.And saying someone has achieved something halfway is like saying well you have peaked and here you are at midpoint...at the halfway mark as was suggested above  so you did alrightish and might as well not try to go the full length and stop here now. It suggests the journey needs to end at averageness and we all need to stop at this point of the hike and no longer try to ascend to one of the mountain tops.For those of us in this world who have had a handful or many naysayers in our life  it can be read in a different tone of voice  one of complacency and mediocrity.It not a good idea for me to accept mediocrity as okay unless I know that I have truly tried my very best over and over again. There is no peace in accepting things in this way  stopping short  of continued tries and never achieving ones full potential sounds like a sad existence and merely settling for second best.,infj,d8brj5a,1,t5_2r39a

9228424,0,t3_56pvjr,I didnt see your other post Im just curious what caused this kind of abrupt break? Of course feel free to not go into it again if you dont want to. You know the pattern with this? Its that we see so much potential in people and we can feel just so good when we are in a loving dynamic its always really painful when both of these end. And because we are feeling emotionally empty or sad our feelings influence our thoughts so much that we can start to think some very scaryhopeless thoughts.. like ill never find that same connection again or no one else will understand me like that or no one will ever be as great as that one. For me any negative beliefs about myself any past failures will rise to the top during these times. And I can kind of ruminate in negativity and hopelessness. I think hopeless is the absolute worst feeling! Like Ill take a gutwrenching sadness over hopelessness any day! But you have to try to remember and its hard boy do I know that these feelings are not true. Out in the world there are thousands and millions of people around you. Out there is someone that you will connect with deeper someone who will understand you better someone that can love greater than you probably can even conceptualize at this point. They will have all kinds of uniquefunny quarks you will share all kinds of new and exciting experiences and you are going to be so ridiculously happy you might not know what to do with yourself. Youll look back on where you are now and be stunned at how much things could change. This isnt me blowin smoke up your bum to help you feel better its like a very high statistical probability. How do I know this? Well for one its a pattern Ive observed in myself and others life over and over. Secondly if your a person who values connection wants to love and be loved wants to understand and be understood the mere momentum of this desire will bring opportunities and potentials in to your cognitive radar constantly. So try to keep some perspective on it. The lows are inevitable I dont know why  it involves duality and a bunch of other crap. But once you ride this out for a bit your going to see things change. They always do you can bank on it. ,infj,d8lrqnt,2,t5_2r39a

Was aggressively selfmedicating with cannabis for the anxiety and depression. Now am trying to quit as it can also bring out the manic side. TLDR when I was too bummed to be around people the high gave me a less bleak and selfcentered perspective on life. It allowed me to detach from my emotions so that I could get my work done. Nowadays its all about my mindset and consciousness. If I have a high quality of awareness and clearheaded presence being high is a silly delight.

9403842,0,t3_596zas,Im a survivor of a very bad ugly and unethical example of polyamory. Sure it looks good on paper but in practice? It can work for some ill give it that and i know  people that actually are healthy people in poly dynamics. But for the most part i saw women that couldnt distinguish between being fucked and being loved. I saw men that sought conquest after conquest. I saw both sexes constantly pursuing new relationship energy NRE as the buzzword is called and people that had to use a whiteboard to manage their dating life because nothing... and i mean NOTHING terrified them more than the prospect of being alone for a night. In my case my ex entered into a master slave relation with a guy that she forced me to accept as her roommate when i lived  hours away. They quit using condoms and i would find out later that not only was he into gang bangs but his primary girlfriend was into being gangbanged on a regular basis. With my ex he dropped her into subspace on a daily and nightly basis and eventually she decided she was going to live out her newly realized life long dream of being gang banged as possibly a one time thing or as a lifestyle as she said and this was part of her femininity her word and self actualization again her words. Our relationship was going to henceforth be that we would each rut and fuck anyone we wanted and if i didnt want to know about her being gang banged or going to swingers clubs with her master and his other girlfriend or anyone else she was fucking then i wasnt to ask. She broke up with me over the phone four years ago this week. Wed been together for four and a half years. She knew her master at that time for less than half the time she knew me. Her last words to me were Weirdsauce Im oh so smart and there are so many things that I want to do and experiences that I want to have and I just dont see that you have a place in my future anymore.I cannot make up any of this. Anyway do what you want with being considering polyamory. As for me im done dating poly women. My future relations will be monogamish  but poly? If its inclusive possibly. Exclusive? Hell. No. Side note Poly and INFJ have nothing to do with each other per se. What i WILL say is i am conflict adverse despite being  and . I found myself adopting coping strategy after coping strategy in that relation because much to my shame and profound realization i learned that i would do nearly anything to preserve the illusion of love. Even after she told me she wanted to be gang banged you know what i did? I didnt run away from that rolling dumpster fire like i should have. I offered to help her get it organized and participate. She... she did not like that idea in the least. She screamed at me That is EXACTLY what I dont want!!!. I was the safe public face she could be seen with. I wasnt to have anything to do with her other personality. Side to the side note i am so much better now and so much better with her gone from my life.

9452068,0,t3_5a55sj,You sound like me. Im wondering if Im an INTJ or an INFJ because I often get caught in the trap of overanalyzing stupid characteristics that have no concrete reflection of MBTI. I have some traits from INFJ and INTJ but INFJs seem to care far more about people and helping others whereas I just want to be alone to work on my research  projects and when I do socialize I do it to find out information or to discuss important ideas etc... I do however smile a lot and dont think I have that stereotypical INTJ stone cold face. Im very warm hearted when I want to be when I think its appropriate but usually it requires acting. ,infj,d9e475s,1,t5_2r39a
9463215,0,t1_d9fg61x,Me? Ni but it took me a long time to realize that since I was so hell bent on finding TiSe happiness. The point is figure out what is more important to have in a relationship and what youre willing to make small sacrifices for since no one person can be everything. I thought having a logical partner who I could learn from was most important but I realized being understood was more important. For me personally I feel NFs understand me and my NiFe better than NTs. Thats not the most important thing for all INFJs though some like my friend want a partner who will join them on their work and have a joint cause is most important. I know one who its most important he has someone who shares his hobbies.My advice is simply date who you fancy to help you identify what it is you need dont use your partner to crutch TiSe desires and be realistic about what needs a partner can fulfill. Once I realized how important it was for me to have my Ni understood by my partner sensing types werent as attractive. Once I realized having a partner who cared as much about my emotions as I cared about his was important INTPs were less attractive to me. Some INFJs however are content to have their Ni needs supported through their career or work so perhaps a relationship with a sensor could work for them. Some INFJs have strong support systems in their families or friends so its not as important to have a partner who has very high emotional intelligence as well. ,infj,d9fj23w,1,t5_2r39a

9499885,0,t3_5aubi1,I understand  what you write.  I could have written your post last week as I had an anxiety breakdown about feeling lonely.  I dont get lonely often but last week I felt SO utterly lonely.  It was triggered by a friendship that has been falling apart over the past few years just losing touch for various reasons no fighting or conflict.  Worrying about my other friends and my boyfriend leaving me although there is ZERO indication that will happen.  I have  friends  if I include the one Im losing  boyfriend and no relationships with family or parents.  I attend a support group in my city but were not friends...but I think I need to change my perspective and consider them as family because I think I can count on them for some support.I worry about ending up utterly alone.  I had a group of friends a few years ago.  One of the women started to exclude me and it eventually pushed me out of the group entirely.  I am still bitter about that especially when I see her in public and she waves at meas if you DIDNT do this to me bitch.  I worry about my current group of friends excluding meI dont really fit in with them but I know they love me the way I am.  And I dont think I have any reason to worry.I am currently trying to be more social and meet new people but its not easy as an introvert who is also frugal and doesnt like to spend a lot of money going out to dinnersdrinks.  I would LOVE to be part of a friendgroup again and I would love to make just one more close friend.  ,infj,d9k2a76,2,t5_2r39a

Even if not all the people who voted for him are racist  i actually disagree with this in my book enabling that behavior pretty much makes you a racist what the fuck they are willing to excuse his racism and make him arguably the most influential person in the world.

9599401,0,t3_5cf84b,So.. INFJP here my wife is strong NTJ with split IE. We just passed our  year dating anniversary and have been married . years. A lot of this post strikes a chord with me. Our relationship has been a very rocky road at points but I always tried to stick it out for many of the reasons outlined above. I have always felt that she is less emotionally involved than Id like and over time she has agreed that she probably isnt as invested as I am. When we were younger our school work and lives offered enough distraction that I just told myself that that things would get better in the future. And they did. We have both very gradually and often painful trended towards the midline between our personalities. However a couple of years ago stresses in our life and differences in how we wanted our lives to further progress caused those differences in personality to reemerge and produce conflict. I finally decided that it was time to leave and start my adult life by my own terms I was twenty when we met and have lived with her since the start. It was the most painful feeling of my life. I felt like I was betraying her but I just couldnt spend the rest of my life without fully reciprocated passion. Then of all things I got her pregnant days before I had planned on telling her my decision. After all of that inner turmoil I again decided to stay as I didnt want my child to ever view me in a tainted light nor did I want their life to be tainted by a broken family. Well as the months went by the thought of our future became easier to bear as the thought of our family seemed to have softened her heart again. And then we learned that our baby would be born with congenital heart disease. We have spent the past calendar year with our daughter in the hospital. In that time stress has taken its toll and as my wife is working again while I stay  hours away with our girl we only see each other half of the days. I often wonder if this scenario has as much effect on our relationship from her perspective as it does from mine. Yet again I find it difficult to raise the motivation to push forward with our marriage. However now the stakes are so much greater and I just dont want to be a shitty person for all the reasons. So with her I will remain and put as much of a lid on my feelings as I need to all the while feeling like my soul is pulled in disparate directions. Who knows what the future will bring as for now it is still just day to day but I still worry that I may be stuck for the rest of my life without emotional fulfillment. TlDr maybe it is a death spiral we shall see but I truly do love her and she is an amazing person. I hope we can work back towards that middle ground that we were finding. ,infj,d9wbm7z,5,t5_2r39a

Im just butting in because I had this related argument with  Fi types ESFP INFP and ENTJ. To them taking offence to an insult the person insulting was responsible for their hurt. I thought well just ignore them. Chosing to put weight to their words was your choice in the end and that one shouldnt be responsible for the feelings of everyone they offend. Anyway ESFP resorted to trying to make her point by speakingscreaming louder than me INFP wanted to understand my position and then went into inner contemplation mode and ENTJ and I tried to continue the debate. Then a good slow dance song came up and ENTJ and I started to dance... the other two started asking why we were dancing after arguing for  minutes.

10012549,0,t3_5j16ud,With MBTI and relationships I feel people put the cart before the horse. I do love knowing peoples types but its not going to prevent me from moving forward with them it simply informs our interactions. The different personality types develop over time and other features emerge as they learn major life lessons. Depending where you are in your own selfdevelopment a type that would have been perfect for you in your early twenties might not be the best match when youre in your early thirties and learning new things about yourself. Conversely types that would have been a horrible choice early on might make a really compatible partner further down the road. It really all depends on what youre looking for. Some people like the mind reading aspect and extreme familiarity and comfort that comes from dating someone of a very similar personality type. Other people want to balance out their weaknesses and find a complimentary opposite. Some people are subconsciously looking for something they did or didnt have as a kid and might choose someone whos got that one trait in spades despite it not being one of the conventional combinations.  Ive seen posts in here about INFJs datingmarrying INFJs ENFJs ISTPs ESTPs INTPs ENTPs INTJs ENTJs INFPs ENFPs ESFPs ISTJ and even ESFJESTJs. And I bet someone out there is like You missed my wifehusband whos an ISFJISFP!!!. Any combo can work although some might be more common than others. Each one of those posters said their partner was perfect for them but they also admitted to having their challenges. It is far less about MBTI type and far more about the individual youre with. Some people and types were going to click with right away and some take time to develop that strong bond.  IMO just find the person thats going to helpsupport you becoming that best version of yourself that youre looking to achieve and I guess whatever type they are is the one you should be dating haha. ,infj,dbcnwy9,9,t5_2r39a

10032413,0,t3_5jcvpn,I see this posted a lot or INFJs posting about losing friends and its something I have a difficult time wrapping my head around because Ive never really lost a friend before.Im  and I met  of my best friends in middle school who I still talk to weekly and then  more girls in high school I went to a private school in a different city and I also still talk to them.  Not to mention I spent  years traveling and didnt get to see some of them for the entire  years and when I came back we picked things up like I never left.  And even when I traveled and moved states every year I still keep in touch with all the people that I met.  I feel like I cant help myself from making new friends and even though I like being super close to just a few there is always room for more.  From posts I see often there are a few things that could explain it.  . INFJs hate shallow friendships and have pretty high standards for what they consider a friend..

There have been depressions and recessions and wars and poverty and corruption and violence and disease and horrible labor conditions all throughout the USs history and these issues have affected everyone.  Obviously a lot of these issues have plagued some groups more than others but the country was never super Great for anyone besides those with money. I think the points they bring up are good overall minus the celebrity talk but these points should be directed towards everyone not just a specific group since there are plenty of nonwhite males who are guilty of perpetuating those failings. ,infj,dbfhz0k,5,t5_2r39a

10408031,0,t3_5ozlvk,INFJs and INTJs are  different kinds of villains.INFJ villains have been addressed. INTJ villains are like Smaug. Which makes sense since Cumberbatch plays Sherlock an INTJ protagonist. Sauron is also likely an INTJ his blind spot for the motivations of his enemy being key evidence  his patience was endless Numenor and his plots appealed to logic not feeling. On the other hand Morgoth is likely an INFJ...internet seems to think hes an ENTJ but the way he identifies the only way to truly torment the indomitable Hurin and his house by afflicting them with subtle but constant tragedy is far too emotionallyoriented for an xNTJ who would just bash their skulls in and leave them for dead if the end goal was to be rid of them all...no reason to delay the inevitable. His leadership involved shaping the world to his imagination and he holed himself up after overextending himself early on.What INTJs lack in INFJstyle subtlety they replace with elegance of thought and ingenuity. They differ in how they appeal to their adherents...Hitler as well as Speer convinced his followers to follow him out of passion for the cause and the person. The evil INTJ is the most likely to convince their followers on the basis of their plan being flat out better than the good side regardless of the aims. Emperor Palpatine is another evil INTJ. xNTJs can identify weakened emotional states but they are not adept at exploiting or changing the emotional state itself.A simpler way of looking at evil INTJs and INFJs and the difference between the two is how you defeat them  it is a fools errand to try to beat them at their own game but one is perfectly suited like no other to defeat the other. INTJ can develop a strategy so rock solid the lessnuanced thinking functions of the INFJ will not be able to match it. The INFJ Frodo must operate in a way that is outside of logic at least of the narrow view of the INTJ Sauron fortunately the INFJ will hone in on exactly how to do that. Gandalf knew he could not serve as Marshall of a war against Sauron because he is also an INTJ and knows that on a level playing field Sauron is likely vastly superior to him in strength only the divine inspiration and intervention from Eru gave Gandalf and his crew the upper hand. He had to do something completely different thus sending an INFJ Hobbit with his ESTJ companion Samwise.,infj,dcntgon,3,t5_2r39a

However I dont want to tell you to discount this piece of constructive criticism from your girlfriend. You prompted her for an opinion on your relationship and she gave you an honest answer. From what I understand she alluded that you are being judgmental about other people and this is something that you do not deny. You might attribute it to you being a pragmatist but she perceives it as negativity. Its a different viewpointalbeit inconvenient to your feelingsbut its not rejection. Take this as an opportunity for selfreflection and selfimprovement OP. Its nothing to overanalyze after all shes told you that shes happy with you and had no immediate complaints. Like you said you guys are in the discovering each other phase its natural to find out about one anothers imperfections and its the tiny glitches like this that will foment relationship growth.

Your place in this world was bought through sacrifice by the hands of PEOPLE and a result of evolution that gives us reason to celebrate our lives and work to provide the same standard of living that has been afforded to you by our ancestors. See the big picture and travel in time backwards to see how much better it has become on all levels for people overall today and then see which places of the world have fallen behind on this trajectory and identify your role in furthering the mission our ancestors have started.

10713262,0,t3_5t7jss,INFJ M here. I worked thru this for a long time. Yes I was the nice guy. Yes I thought I was too sensitive. Etc Etc Etc.What works for me is this Be a romantic but keep it subtle at first. Let the girl discover the romance in you. Dont hold it back. Dont show it all at once. Most women have the same dream of a beautiful life. Hell most people do. For me owning my sexual amp masculine side is huge. Romance is so emotion heavy that the game and sexual tension is not in the forefront. For most girls under  game and sexual tension are super super key to a satisfying relationship. But breathe your romance into these  things. In other words use romantic game like subtle nextlevel flirting and use romantic intimate sexual tension like touch and eye contact rather than all the bullshit and hypersexual machoismo of dominance and ego posturing.Im finding a balance between injecting macho horsing around and gooey romance. Someplace in the middle is the sweet spot for me now. Give but dont give too much. Be giving but remain independent. Focus more on the girl herself and relating rather than the idea of it all which is what Romance is its an idealization of relationships.,infj,ddkzr8x,11,t5_2r39a

10829898,0,t3_5uqfez,You need distance. I really relate with this.One thing Ive learned about myself is for both friends not acquaintances and relationships I need to have a sense of stabilitygroundedness from my partner. This is why traditional online dating has never ever worked out for me. To me there is an implied sense that most people are dating around on stuff like that. I hate feeling like I have competition or arent valued for who I really am deep down. I like to invest in friends and lovers who I know can actually hold onto that investment. Some people are naturally this way and I quickly can trust them in this manner others are a lot more flighty or uncertain so Ill need to establish trustworthy history with them before I feel comfortable thinking of them in this way.Heres the cold hard facts She likes you but not in a deep way. You do even though you arent technically dating. Even if you were going to be friends youd feel crushed every time she got a new hot date.Give that connection some distance so you can avoid hard feelings by expecting more than there really is between you. Something could balance out in the future letting you actually be friends but you need time to distance yourself from the feelings you have now. And in my experience INFJs need a lot of time. Im not sure youll ever end up encountering her again in your future though since you really only know her through a handful of dates.Be open say you have feelings that she probably already knows about and that you might need some distance to keep things balanced. Dont burn the bridge or door slam because youll never know if you have to cross that bridge again.,infj,ddx107j,1,t5_2r39a

Poor guy has depression and half this subreddit can understand that but God damn you do not tell your significant other leave or not I dont really care.But two OP youre right this also isnt about you. Hes got depression. Hes gonna act like that.  This is not new behaviour considering the context of the conversation. Since youre the better equipped decide to stay with him for the long haul or leave.  And I have serious problems with two contextual things about this conversation. One it sounds like youre guilt tripping him for not being present. Yikes.Two. Dont softly cry in front of him. Did you imagine it would move him into holding you or snapping out of his unhappiness?  Thats what I picture when you do thatId be incredulously wondering if thats your cry for help for me to become prince charming.  If you did that to me after Ive clearly stated my numb emotions plus my clear vocalizations that you doing so makes me feel guilty I certainly would interpret it as a manipulation tactic and no longer just an admission of you expressing valid emotions.  Yours is cant you see Im trying cant you just tell me what you want which I feel forbelieve me Ive dated a guy like this and its torture. But his is Ive told you when you tell me that it makes me feel like I cant love you enough to match your expectations and now Im even more exhausted. So there you go.I sound cruel when I say these things.  Please note Im about  sure you are emotionally exhausted out of your wits.  But if i had a dollar for every time an xnfp reacted to my displays of sadnessdepression with Why are you doing this to me I would be a rich woman. Depression turns someone into a cage. They are the cage and all they know is the cage. That romantic FiNe will put both of you through hell if you keep it up with someone this heavily depressed like him.My advice break up. He sounds like he needs to work on himself.  You cant save him and he cant save you.

I had been drinking until I fell asleep most nights for the past two years trying to cope with everincreasing anxiety. Its not been easy but things are definitely getting slowly and steadily better.Alcoholism arises from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors but I do wonder if as INFJs were particularly susceptible to addiction when were unwell for other reasons. Im not an MBTI expert but I know people talk about being in the grip of inferior Se. When Im not doing well I become obsessed with how Im feeling and it seems like any kind of distress is a harbinger of doom. Its helped me a lot to prove to myself that really difficult emotions are eventually going to fade naturally and I dont have to drink to escape them.

10997894,0,t3_5x0lss,Great post! I find the topic of memory very interesting and have been developing my own theories and thoughts on it. Here they goWhat Ive experienced is that I am very very bad at real world things like remembering the color of someones shirt even if you were to ask me about it  minute after seeing the person. Like you said with the numbers thing I need to be able to visualize it or make some sort of connection to something else.I tend to remember things in relation to other things. I dont need it to have been physically drawn out per say but there needs to be some kind of mental web in my head that I connect it to. If Im remembering someones birthday I can remember Oh thats exactly one month after my other friends birthday which is exactly  months and  days after mine.If someone like an ENFP first prompts even  fact from the past the rest of the story can often be filled in in my mind. I view my memories almost like a computer encryption system. If someone else gives me an encryption key all of a sudden I have access to all of my scrambled memories.Ive also noticed that people tend to remember things that matter to them and because of that I think thats how personality types tend to determine how we store memories and choose which memories to store.Going off of my last theory Ive tried to a put a lot of effort into valuing certain things more. For instance I really want to get good at remembering first impressions in detail so when I finish an encounter I try to go over the event in my head to store that memory. I want to be able to have a fun story  with a future friend saying remember on that day I first met you and you did ?I too remember feelings intensely from the past. I remember not only what I felt in an instance but also what everyone around me felt and how that played into the group dynamic. This is a bit of a side tangent but Ive had another theory that the ability to recall past emotions is linked to empathy. My rational for this is that in a way you were a different person in the past. You feel bad for that person who did not know as much or see things as clearly as you do now.Phew. Anyways Im going to wrap it up here. This is such an interesting topic! The brain is so ridiculously complex. I cannot even fathom it.,infj,deekt13,8,t5_2r39a

11012574,0,t3_5x8sk4,Hi there! Another Christian INFJ here I understand what you mean. Unfortunately the church draws in hurt people and just like populations of people in any other place there are people that talk the talk without walking the walk people who are fake judgemental meanspirited those who want to use religion to abuse others etc. Theres also just so much variation in what Christian means today. So many different denominations that believe soooo many different things.There were definitely a few roadblocks in terms of my personality and my religious beliefs. If I didnt have the crazy unexplainable experience that I did when I was  I wouldnt believe in God or be a Christian I also wouldnt be alive right now but I guess thats besides the point. One main issue I had with Christian ideas is that some of it conflicted with my theorizing and empathy. I was hung up over how a compassionate allloving God could condemn some people to hell for eternity not every church even believes this but again I suppose its besides the point. Even those who are good people but just never accepted Jesus? Or didnt believe there was only one way to God? It hurt to think about and I couldnt wrap my head around it. I remember watching a documentary on Youtube about Jeffrey Dahmer the serial killer who would target gay men. One of the comments struck me deeply and I still think about it sometimes. It read something like you Christians disgust me. According to what you believe Jeffrey Dahmer is in heaven right now because he said sorry to God and accepted Jesus before he died but all those gay men he killed are burning in hell because they died in sin right? I can spout out the rationalizations and church stance on this stuff because  years of bible school will do that to you lol but it still gives me pause and I could spend forever trying to wrap my head around it. But this is still my favourite topic to debate with my dad weve come to the conclusion that we dont have all the answers but we know God is real and we trust Him to be fair and just when it comes to each individual case. The other thing is that its hard being an INFJ Christian saving yourself for marriage again not a thing all Christian groups believe I feel like you have to be more specific than just Christian nowadays P what type do you mean? I feel like our type is already so introverted tentative and lonely that when you tack on extra requirements youd need out of relationships like they have to be Christian they have to be willing to wait it shrinks the dating pool even more exponentially. Im not willing to compromise my values or my faith just for the sake of being in relationship though so I guess Im at an impasse ,infj,deg8t81,16,t5_2r39a

11054016,0,t3_5xlao4,Sometimes we look at people with the same lens we use to look at ourselves which is a problem.  When examining ourselves we might use a macro  lens which magnifies all of our own problems and shortcomings how weve failed why were so bad. We use this lens to find and eliminate our faults on a granular level. So to us this magnifying glass might be a wonderful tool but to turn it on others is highly unfair.Basically what youre doing is saying hey I have these faults and have seen bad undesirable things on a very intimate level and then youre using the very tool made for finding faults on other people. Of course youre going to find them! Or maybe the lens is so zoomed in and distorted that you are finding things that look like these faults even if theyre not there or are just latent. Stop using that lens. What you need is more perspective and empathy. Turn it around and look through the other end of the telescope. See yourself from far away. See everyone else from far away. Look how similar we all are from up here.  Look at how were all trying so hard. Look at how we all want to be loved and are confused and frustrated at the nature of the world and what it demands from us. Look at us all struggling to connect struggling to be our better selves struggling with the idea that we might never achieve our dreams and what we want. Were all lost and confused and making mistakes well regret for a life time.  Were all imperfect were all trying were not all bad were not all good were just humans. Extend some love and understanding to that suffering. Extend some love and understanding to yourself. Know that everyone has bad tendencies but they are as equally as capable for good amazing and wonderful things. Make a new lens for yourself. Its a lens which highlights the positive things in people where they made the hard choice where they did their best against difficult circumstances. Its going to feel weird and distorted for awhile and you might not trust what you see but practice using that lens on yourself and others and you will see and experience and entirely new world.      ,infj,dekycs6,3,t5_2r39a

11223633,0,t1_df3pq20,I agree. It depends on who. The healthy people in my life have the common sense to not step on my boundaries so I dont have to assert myself. If someone continues to step on me they are the same people who dont like it when people assert themselves. ,infj,df46o4g,1,t5_2r39a

11277020,0,t3_60fjub,In the past  years I went through  points in that time where I was smoking TONS of weed. I recently started cutting down by just not buying. My mindset for that is If I have it Im gonna smoke it. So I usually dont smoke at home now. Sometimes Ill pick up just a gram and conserve it. My friends will occasionally offer me a bowl or well smoke a joint which I think is ok. The point when it becomes a problem is when you feel that you NEED to smoke. Sure it isnt as fun being sober but we need that part of us more than we need the substance.,infj,dfa8fgc,1,t5_2r39a

11379525,0,t1_dflr8wb,THANKS FOR THE CONCERN AND REPLY.. These dark thoughts scare me though Ive never ever acted on them. I think they exist because I dont lash out at people its like I dont have an outlet to release my anger so all the bottled frustration brews something morbid.I might have something call misophonia hatred of specific sounds? At work Ive got some mindnumbingly dimwitted colleagues who think its fine to conduct a finger drumming session every  minutes. They will be tapping away on their table stomping their feet. One guy has a medical condition where he burps every few minutes as well like really loud sarlacc pitlike burps. And when youre trying to get work done its infuriating as hell dealing with this and people whistling sinusbreathing gargling coughing without closing their mouths etc. I get thoughts of chopping off their arms and beating them to death with it. I am able to sit still and do work quietly thats why I get mad because HAS NOBODY EVER TAUGHT THEM SOCIAL WORKPLACE ETIQUETTE? I wish I was an assertive NO FUCKS GIVEN type of person who can harshly tell these guys to STFU. . Will definitely look into the attachment style you mentioned. Yes I definitely yearn for association. Kinda sucks when you feel like your antenna can receive many different wavelengths but nobody can read yours.. I would say that there isnt much risk of me acting on my dark thoughts. I do speak to my parents about this but they dismiss this and tell me to stop watching violent films. But I think it will take a serious to push me over the edge.. The more bothersome thing is the dating most friends I have seem to be getting attached and have less time to hangout which makes me feel lonely and depressed. In my idealistic mind I thought I wouldve find someone right for me by now. ,infj,dflum2t,1,t5_2r39a

Also he intps have a tendency to copy people they are close to subconsciously this occurs due to a lack of self confidence in your own personality.You could try telling him that you like him the way he is give him some confidence but honestly Ive never managed to get out of such a loop with even my best attempts so I doubt anybody can. Worth a shot though.Im pretty sure I skipped over most of the important pointsEdit so o read in a bit more detailand I noticed that hes trying to become like you because anxious about your relationship.

11425984,0,t1_dfpkifo,I used to see it this way too! Yuck! Ive gotten better at networking since I started seeing it as building a resource for myself. Im a virtual administrator and project manager. So I find myself needing a list of awesome copywriters graphics designers etc. I really see it as a who do I know who could fill this position or that I could refer to that I know and believe in. With my business I approach it as deep connections mean everything which means with networking Im testing the waters to make sure Im working with people who match my brand and my approach to work which is warm and fuzzy. Yes I am getting something from it but I like deep connected etc. Often I look to make a friend too. Recently I did some online networking for market research. Now one of my respondents is a weekly check in for hows it goings etc. Also we talk about doctor who a lot. Maybe this approach could help you? ,infj,dfr4gpe,2,t5_2r39a

11618809,0,t3_65sete,Its going to be a longhaul. You have a gift and I encourage you to develop it. So many of us shy away from it and it can become stunted if not practiced. That may seem good but as you mature and learn to use it to yours and everyone you loves benefit you may regret not using it sooner because it wont ever go away it will just stay in an undeveloped state if you push it away too aggressively and it may reap havoc on your personal life as you forget how to control it.For tuning it I like mindfulness practice. It plays on our relief function of introverted thinking so thats another reason it can really bring a sense of peace and groundedness. Over time it gives you the tools to recognize which emotions are present. Then you can study them.Will it immediately help? Probably not but I find that recognizing the emotion and observing it diminishes its power over you. How to feel an emotion? Feel the physical heartracing sinking feeling etc and name it despair or sadness or heartsinking feeling or rainy umbrella. Whatever you want. Put it in your mental bestiary of emotions. Observe where your memories and thoughts for the future go when experiencing it. You may want to write it all down. Keep the notes and turn them into something beautiful down the line.,infj,dgd03vo,6,t5_2r39a

When you can see how the future is realistically going to play out or what is truly within a situation the things you think about and want are going to be close enough to what was going to happen anyways.

11716051,0,t3_67392w,i am an infj female dating an entp male. there are so many strengths weaknesses and some of them are both the strengths are the amazing conversations you two will have. infjs are very people minded realistic and can be quite emotional or at least this is my experience as an infj. i feel very strongly about people and have lots of theories about how they work i can be very centric in my thinking. however he is ALWAYS thinking of such big things. he considers the whole world and the effects of everything on it. its so cool to talk about religion sex people aliens even.the sex is phenomenal. both of us are always so concerned about giving to the other. you also feel very comfortable with them. in these relationships it is easy to get really close very fast and its likely the entp will be your best friend as well as your boyfriend. so the sex is great. additionally he will make such a good friend. he will always bring new perspectives to your thinking. when you overthink jump to conclusions and idealize everything he will make you step back consider it objectively and give you a calm head. there are weaknesses too. often communication can be difficult. infjs and entps are very very different and it can be so hard to relate. sometimes the infj will feel like something is very important and be very emotional about it whereas the entp will not see the worth. as an infj you will be hurt sometimes by what comes across as insensitivity but is rather logic and as an entp you will be confused and overwhelmed by the infjs emotions often. additionally emotions can be very overwhelming in these relationships. make SURE in a relationship with this you two make time to be affectionate and loving to always share love and admiration for the other. compliments affection and physical contact are vital to this relationship. infjs have a lot of love to give and entps will thrive when shown this love. entps have a strong drive to help and the infjs will thrive when supported like this.its a beautiful relationship.,infj,dgo1kr8,2,t5_2r39a
