3425222,0,t3_2zgn2o,Im surprised no one linked the VoD here. Im really excited to see where this goes. Ive met Matt and some of the other voice actors and theyre amazingly talented people. What do you guys think?,geekandsundry,cpip841,2,t5_2ufsx
5871454,0,t3_3vone8,Link to the video if you want to watch Wil his son Nolan Meredith Salenger and Kelly Hu play.  I waited until last minute last year but then couldnt find it locally and Amazon was out of stock ended up ordering it in March.  Dont make my mistake if you want to play this with your family and friends.,geekandsundry,cxpa2e1,2,t5_2ufsx
5977948,0,t3_3x8osc,Loved the episode the whole season really this may be the best web series so far.The story arc appears to be complete though with a very satisfying ending makes me wonder if there will be a third season and I could imagine the actors being ready to move on to other projects  would love to see them appear in feature films. Especially Charlotte Rogers and Elisabeth Neale they need big leading roles stat!,geekandsundry,cy38nee,2,t5_2ufsx

9116401,0,t1_d87m05c,I say just take the free  months and watch Alpha slowly die while no one subscribes.,geekandsundry,d87n6xg,2,t5_2ufsx
9169121,0,t1_d883afg,I can  understand creating new content and putting it on Alpha. I can understand adding tieins to existing shows on Alpha. What I cant understand is taking existing content that was available to everyone freely is something families take great pride in enjoying together and then telling people they have to pay for it.,geekandsundry,d8e95u7,1,t5_2ufsx
9677037,0,t3_5dnkg4,So since Alpha decided to launch yesterday I thought I would try my  months from Twitch subbing...It keeps telling me the same thing that my address doesnt match anything in postal records.  My address... the same one I have used for the past  years... is unknown.  Thanks but no thanks LDN.  You even delayed the launch for a money generating platform I would think the least you could have gotten right on day  was the payment form.,geekandsundry,da5wcer,3,t5_2ufsx

10586822,0,t1_dd7ul31,Yep! Star Realms S E debuted on Alpha live last night on Alpha we air the new episode as a livestream and its then available on Alpha as VOD. On YouTube its the Monarch episode S E. So new episodes of TableTop are available on Wednesdays on both Alpha AND YouTube with most of the season available already on Alpha.A bit confusing to explain  let me know if you have questions!,geekandsundry,dd7y6vo,2,t5_2ufsx
10843953,0,t3_5txlcx,Im super excited that Ill be able to see the entire season without an Alpha subscription. This is good news. ,geekandsundry,ddyh78a,2,t5_2ufsx
