24289,0,t3_1ueced,The penultimate highproof sherried Scotch would probably be Aberlours Abunadh. Its a cask strength dream. If your GF doesnt like high proof shes probably not going to like a cask strength Scotch either but Aberlour is very wellreceived. They also made a  abv  year non chillfiltered expression which runs  and is fantastic. Make sure you buy the NCF edition the normal s are lackluster.Macallan used to release a cask strength sherried edition as well but they discontinued it in . Its a shame that stuff was amazing. There are many others Aberlour is just a wellknown crowd pleaser. Enjoy your Scotch journey!

29329,0,t1_cehqj03,Its worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it. Many sites list scotch at outrageous prices that never sell HTFW im looking at you. This one may be worth  GBP more or less. Selling it may not be worth your while doing it solo is tricky depending where you are with licensing laws and the sale of alcohol etc. Selling through an agency or auction house is fine but the commissions will diminish your return.If it was me Id take some time with more entrylevel malts over the next  months get to know whisky a bit more intimately then open this! Whisky is to be opened and enjoyed in my opinion. Learn more take it slow then open this in a couple of years with some likeminded scotch buffs and enjoy all the flavour profiles youve spent time developing.Best wishes.EDIT just a side note if youre not that experienced at this point please dont store this bottle on its side either.

79599,0,t3_1uzqru,I have a  year old sherried Bunnahabhain from Signatory thats pretty freakin good.  Paid just under  for it and I saw another bottle recently at my local store.  The problem of course is that this is not a starter scotch.  Its got a pretty intense flavor profile that I would not have liked if I hadnt had a pretty broad exposure to single malts... the sweet spot for most scotch and bourbon is like the  year range.  Once its older than that it can turn funky in the barrel if the distiller doesnt know what theyre doing.  If the point is to drink something older than you find a good whisky bar and dont blow your wad.  If your goal is to drink something truly exceptional I might be able to be more helpful if I know what you really like.    ,Scotch,cenhoqq,3,t5_2qq65

Floral honey. Orange and mango juice concentrate. Overripe pears and nectarines. Ginlike botanicals juniper lemon peel coriander. Fresh parsley. Icing sugar. Floral and grassy. Light oak spice. Saltiness at the back. Taste Medium bodied and moderately viscous with a crisp cereal character. Junipery floral notes. Almond oil and marzipan. Apple and orange juice. Dried mango and kiwi. Vanilla essence. Barley sugar. Again some salty minerality on the back palate as well as slightly bitter grassiness. Finish A bit short but pleasant with lingering citrus peel parsley salt liquorice and light oak spice.A nice floral grassy and fruity Speysider thats what it says on the bottle but I think its a Highlander? with some unexpected saltiness. The juniper notes almost makes this taste like a whiskygin hybrid.

315174,0,t1_cfdezod,What Ive learnt about whisky as Ive tried more and more is that each one is entirely different it is all about looking at the subtleties. Because of this the range of whiskies is near endless and as long as you continue to try more then each one will be its own experience.A basic talk of range might boil down to bourbon cask dominant sherry cask dominant and peat dominant. However like I said if you enjoy sherry dominant whiskies doesnt mean you will enjoy them all as they are all their own unique whisky. As for the recommendation If you are interested in Ardbeg Uigedail then I would first pick up something with big sherry notes before hand such as Aberlour  or Glendronach . This way you will not only be able to appreciate the peat from the Ardbeg but also the beautiful sherry fruitcake notes that are throughout the Uigedail.,Scotch,cfdfqr2,2,t5_2qq65

516630,0,t3_20145i,Since no one really seems to be answering the question of why but rather just saying that there are Ill take a crack at that.There is a big difference between fortified wine casks and red or white but its a bit rarer wine casks. The big thing is that unfortified wine is much drier and that carries through to the whisky. Sherry is very sweet and rich so the casks tend to impart big fruity notes. Fruitcake apricots raisins  that type of thing. Red wine is much less sweet so what you tend to get is a much drier more bitter and tanniny whisky. It often becomes very overwhelming as well which is why you rarely see whiskies that have spent their entire lives in wine casks but rather are relatively briefly finished in them. The best wine finishes tend to be from very sweet mild wines  Sauternes gets used quite a lot and rather successfully for example. Im perhaps overly sensitive to bitterness so I find most wine finished whiskies offputting and overly tanniny.,Scotch,cfyztdf,3,t5_2qq65

528705,0,t3_2070uf,Ardbeg Uigeadail . ABV nonchill filteredIve been waiting to try this out for a longgg time. I bought the Ardbeg Explorer pack a while ago and it came with the  and a mini of Uig and Corry. Finally decided to open it up! Nose Smells like a mix of Laphroaig  and Aberlour NCF. Smoke peat incense sweet the jam in strawberry pop tarts thick.  Palate I always have a hard time with this part. Oily tangy bold heavy bittersweet. Finish Take some mexican candy from the liquor store light it on fire and breath in the smoke. Prunes plums wood smoke and peat of course.I am glad I got a miniature of this. I like the contrast of flavors and am in love with the nose. To me its a combination of the two most distinct flavors of whisky. I would rate it higher however I expected the palate and finish to be as distinct from other Islays as the nose is. It fell a bit short in the scoring because of this. And so I think I am one of the few who would legitimately prefer Laga  over the Uig.,Scotch,cg0dcjy,6,t5_2qq65

684668,0,t3_220d8g,Okay Ive been reviewing a good mixture of Higher End malts and lower end ones. Gotta steady myself start into some good priced malts that arent rare as heck...Before I dive into the rare as heck ones. Nut on the road Prick on the Pavement Taint on the Tarmac lets do this!First up thanks so much to umentel for the swap of this one. Its like a whole bunch of whiskies not available in Ontario at the moment and if it were Id probably have to trade my first born for a bottle.Not that I know where or who that first born is but it would be rough doing the trade none the less.Port Charlotte An Turas Mor is yet another malt from the Bruichladdich distillery this one being the first NAS under their Port Charlotte Brand. Dont blink they may come out with  more whiskies while your eyes involuntarily shut.The Port Charlotte line is their Heavily Peated ones the ones that give you coal miners lung and you love it.And... well thats all I could find out about this one. Its the first of the PC that isnt cask strength so some people think its the redheaded step child. Sure its not loved but mostly just because the other brothers and sisters all work for NASA.Enough jibberjabber lets try this!Price NA in OntarioRegion IslayAbv Nose Peat  chocolate dried chili pepper flakes vanilla melon leather campfire baconWow. You know looking back its been awhile since Ive had a nice peaty whisky and this has a nice smooth smell to it. Just a little heat some vanilla a little fruit and then leather campfire bacon.Giving up that random kid I dont know about for a bottle is sounding better as I nose this.Taste Sweet corn peatsmoke bacon BBQ ribs custard toffeeAlmost a bourbon taste to it yet with that heavy I just walked into a Southern restaurant and my pants hate me taste as well.Its a good thing but I wish that the sweetness wasnt just from the corn or a little fruit or chocolate elements or some more spices.Finish Peat yoghurt raisin anise cloves cracklins brine Tiramasu orange juiceInteresting finish. Cracklins are fried pork pieces like bacon.Yet theres a nice spice and acidity to it as well not just a peat bomb.Conclusion I have no idea how any of the hard to find Port Charlottes taste but given how good this is I can only assume amazing. What Im saying is Say hello to your new parents the Liquor store if it ever comes to Ontario.That all said the taste while nice need a little more going on to be Yes I will commit human trafficking level of good. Id buy this instead of Ardbeg  as its just that little bit better which is saying quite a bit.Scotch review  Islay review Other Bruichladdich reviews Bruichladdich  year  The Laddie Ten Bruichladdich  year Old Bruichladdich  year Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask Bruichladdich DNA th Edition MCMLXXXV Bruichladdich Octomore .

Im not well versed in BenRiachs though Ive had a couple.  In fact the whisky list didnt even list the age so I had no idea what it was until the next day when I emailed them to ask. Color golden Nose Smokey Vanilla pleasant plastic rubber.  Peated motor oil. A Mezcalness. PaperCardboard. Taste Brown Sugar honey.  Peated Oaky Toffee.   Deep Sugar Maltiness.  Molasses kick of Root Beer.  Finish longing end in sweet peat. very pleasant surprise.  I noted that I should buy it then went to look for it only to find two different bottlings one  and one  for a hefty price... of course!  I was thinking it was a regular bottling for maybe  but I wont be buying one figures  I find a new bottling that I like and its uberpriced.

This Ancnoc is peated to  ppm. Lets see how it turns out.Colour Light goldNose Light fragrant peat smoke quite delicate Vanilla and sweet spices sweet malt orchard fruits. Mellows out a little over time.Taste Very malty almost overpowering subdued peat toffee and sweet chocolate with caramel filling. Some pepper and apples at the end. A little astringent.Finish Medium spices with pepper and cardamom peat smoke but no longer the delicate kind I found in the nose. A little harsh and not too long. Conclusion This reminded me a lot of the Ardmore Traditional but slightly better. Im a little underwhelmed by this one and seem to have a hard time with very malty malts funnily enough. I will try to source some of the more traditional and older AnCnocs as this one seems a little too young and unrefined.Score Review ,Scotch,cinweix,3,t5_2qq65

1530289,0,t3_2br6vj,For my th review Ive got something that I dont think has been reviewed on rscotch. This is William Grant and Sons Grangestone Thirty the oldest whisky Ive ever tried. Im hanging out with a close friend and former roommate this weekend and he was kind enough to share a dram of this bottle with me. As a bonus he took tasting notes that Ive included at the end of this review. It had its red flags its a blend low proof old enough to be overoaked its  for a  year old whisky and finally theres no Grangestone distillery and its not obviously an IB. What to make of such a scotch? The price and age statement independently set higher expectations but the combination of the two seems wrong. This brand is pushed pretty hard at Total Wine which makes one worry that this is more show than it is substance. Lets find out!Grangestone ThirtyStrength Color Golden brown. Nose Citrus and oak. Smells remarkably like an old bourbon to me. This has an elegant nose and subtle nose almost colognelike. Theres a faint watermelon note which is a first for me from a scotch. Grassy notes. Palate Dry and thin but very smooth. Prominent malt character and a bready character. Some oak and light chocolate and caramel. Finish Warm and lingering. Graham cracker and a little oakiness. Summary This is quite nice and a reminder not to judge a book by its cover. It doesnt taste  years old or like a blend but it tastes good.  good? Well thats up to you. If I had to compare this to something Id say its most like Old Pulteney . The barrels this was aged in must have been tired since  years havent given it nearly the oak character youd expect. That being said its quite balanced and malty much like younger spirits like OP or the lower proof Amrut single malt whisky. Want a bottle of Thirty year old scotch that doesnt involve taking out a second mortgage and doesnt taste like liquid tree? Give this a go. Want this flavor profile for half the price? Get OP instead.

In fact it will tend to grow better but less peaty watch out for that more complete and put together after  months after it has been opened and at least a little air let it. Once you get past the halfway point the race is on. Well its a slow race. From experience you have about  months before it becomes noticeably  for lack of a better term  flat. As you drink more from the bottle the oxidation process speeds up and so must your imbibification if you want to drink it while it is still in its prime.So doing the math  months if you drink fast  months if you drink slow.

Increasingly difficult to do. A gamble might be great might be shit.   Buy casks at bottling age from the distillery. Might just not fit the house flavour but likely to be bad  Buy on the open market. Again a lot of these casks are likely to be second rate Do they have their own dunnage wharehouse or keep their casks at the distilleries? Do they rerack  finish their whiskys? Bottle as CS  NAC  UCF? Single cask  vatted? Resell bad casks  bottle  blend?

Also if youre really lucky then they ran out of the newer barrels and had to dip into some older ones which would be much darker and the darker than normal color may be missed at first if they just add X amount of coloring and then go from there rather than looking at the whiskey first.As a blended scotch it should be above and beyond more consistent than any single malt from bottle to bottle so they screwed up.,Scotch,cl8dp6c,-2,t5_2qq65

Before this Ive only had the Nadurra so my Glenlivet experience is fairly limited. Nose Very sweet amp rich seasoned oak. Lots of vanilla  almost bourbon level vanilla. Honey topped barley with some delicate spices sprinkled in. Mouthfeel MediumLight weightPalate Again very sweet up front with marzipan honey and vanilla. Malt blended with black pepper and other spices toward the rear palate. The oak emerges in the rear palate as well but takes a bitter turn for me after a few sips.Finish Short finish full of seasoned oak pepper becoming slightly astringent at the end.Balance Some interesting oakspice notes but falls flat for me due to the . One of those cases where even  more ABV would help out here.Rating   Not bad. Certainly an enjoyable pour but it doesnt have the depth to keep me coming back on a regular basis. Its sweet spicy and interesting in its own due to the french oak influence but the proof holds this one back.Value for the money This isnt a bad buy for  by any means  I could think of a few things that are pricier than this that I would pass over in favor of this.

Im a cheap ass too. My pal loves a good cocktail. Hes a self described Gin Hound. The idea of drinking a spirit neat was a foreign concept to him three months ago. I shared some Laphroaig Ten and Aberlour  with him. Drank out of glencairns. Let the spirit breathe. Focused on the nose. I asked him questions made him think about what he was experiencing. He asked me questions. Started to see whisky as an experience not as a shooter. Long story short he had a housewarming party and asked for Scottish whisky instead of your typical gifts. I assembled a whisky list and he went from a single bottle of Glenfiddich  to a sizeable and impressive collection. Im reaping all the benefits.

And then I went to Wales.Ever been to Cardiff? Well as Whovians my wife and I had to go. I mean its where Doctor Who and Torchwood takes place for the good seasons!Well let me tell you about Cardiff Its not the jewel of Wales. Its more like the Windsor of Wales. Nice enough place though theres some rough spots. And we may have been the victims of some casual racism at a pub named after their greatest hero. Not to mention there seemed to be a general poop and scoop disconnect among the populace. That second part specifically.None the less Ill always remember Cardiff as the place that actually had Kilchoman Single Bourbon Cask  year old the single cask bottle I had tried in Edinburgh and hunted for the entire trip. So I loved it there but was that just because I was tired from walking up a mountain and happy to be in Scotland? Well see. This is a rereview however there are some mitigating circumstances. This isnt the same bottle. This is my bottle. I reviewed Kilderkin Houses bottle before.. Im not on vacation Im actually pretty busy at work and US Thanksgiving while a nice vacation for Americans is pure stress for people in the Marketing Research Industry.. This is the last dram of the bottle. Ive done my best to avoid oxidization even changing it to a smaller bottle however it has oxidized since I first had it.Lets see how it stands up.Region IslayPrice NA in OntarioCask Number Bottle Number Cask Type BourbonDistillation Date ..Bottle Date ..Abv .Colour Light YellowNose Peat vanilla lemon gingersnap cookies smoked pork tobaccoThe spice isnt as forward as it was in the last bottle. The BBQ notes smoked pork the pear has gone a little more acidic and its less sweet than before.Still I love this nose.Taste Gingerale lemon nutmeg grassy mushroom anise tannic baconNo earthworm taste this time which is odd. I remember the Machir Bay having that taste as well though the meaty gummy and earthy notes arent as complete in this bottle.Less fruit as well. Im guessing its lost some of that due to age.Finish Spritey pine mushroom Swedish berries pepper lemongrass peat dark chocolate hamVery similar finish as before. Again the meat isnt as forward though its still there. And its long sugary and wonderful finish.Conclusion Before I gave this a  and I think some of that was because it was a higher Abv the bottle was freshly opened and I was on vacation. And excited. And maybe a tad drunk. And maybe in the middle of a bender in the UK Next April fingers crossed!.Anyway I still think this is an amazing dram. It has notes that youd swear could only come from a wine cask or specifically a sherry cask. The vanilla is amazing the spice is great and the juice is that signature young Kilchoman excellence.   And finally we come to something I ordered because... well who doesnt want to try a Kilchoman IB?A little about That Boutiquey Whisky Company. It sounds like such a throw away line yet they serve a purpose in the Scotch Ecosystem. They take miniscule parcels of forgotten stock or lost casks all NAS and then bottle them.Does this always create something good? No what are you kidding? Its basically random vulture grabbing. And at least its NAS because it has to be.Kilchoman Batch  That Boutiquey Whisky Company is the first Batch from Kilchoman to this company that theyve been able to grab up. Its covered in Science because Kilchoman grows  of the grain used in their drams save for the  Islay which is all of it. Theyve been figuring out the right types of grain that survive.Wish OUR distilleries would take that much pride in their work...Theres  bottles of this one so lets see if its as good as Jimbo Murray said it was.Region IslayPrice NA in Ontario I know Im surprised tooAbv .Colour Sunflower yellowNose Soft bacon strawberry fresh pastry lemon zest vanilla smoke gingerbreadBy soft bacon I mean its not a punched up huge bacon note more so a light eating at a waffle house bacon note.Sweet and somewhat different than regular Kilchoman it has notes that remind me of the Bourbon Cask. Very nice.Taste Brown sugar vanilla smoke pear oak aniseVery sweet. Almost like a Rum. Or a Rum Cask Whisky. Or almost a Caramel. Much strong. Wow.Also this bottling really shows off the anise after it sits for awhile. That note is pretty consistent for Kilchoman however here its up front banging on the door.Finish Peat chocolate raspberry cinnamon ginger appleBig chocolatey spicy finish. Not complex enough to make something out of it Like a Mexican Hot Chocolate or a Spice Cake however just enough to keep me interested.Conclusion This is a pretty nice dram. Id go so far to say its the poor mans Bourbon Cask. Given that the Bourbon cask is sold out Id even say this is a good replacement.Heck Id even go so far to say Buy this over the  Islay rd edition. Both are nice yet the additional Abv and I suspect time in an Exbourbon barrel really makes this one a contender.Scotch reviews  Islay reviews  Whisky network reviews Other Kilchoman reviews Kilchoman Machir Bay Kilchoman Single Bourbon Cask  year old,Scotch,cmckmvv,6,t5_2qq65

A peat monster? Laphroaig Quarter Cask and Caol Ila  Year Old are often rated very well. And Glenfarclas  high abv Nikka from the Barrel Japan or Redbreast  Year Old Irish pot still might be excellent choices as well.

2484382,0,t3_2o1n65,Repost of my Ardbeg  post from a year ago  The first scotch I ever really truly enjoyed was a peated Scotch. This is not a review of that scotch this is just a tribute. Or rather this is a review of the Scotch that took its place as my favourite for a short time Today I will be reviewing Ardbeg . It has since been dethroned by its successor the great Oog which you can check out here however I still love the .Warning If you never wondered what a campfire would taste like if you could swallow it whole then you may not enjoy this Scotch.Price . CAD for a ml however I picked up this ml sample in Scotland for Abv Region IslayColour Pale apple juice. No colouring here from what I can tellNose Bacon sea salt violets jerky peat peanuts fresh cut crass fire almond extract sour pear.When I order this in a restaurant everyone in the restaurant knows that Ive ordered a Scotch. Or perhaps that Im on fire. The smoke takes center stage. When I first asked for the smokiest scotch the store had they handed me this one... followed by the great Oog. The violets and the almond extractsour pear pop up in the background which is a nice contrast.Taste Smoke currants jerky tartness lemon pie vegetation. The taste itself is light with the smoke tripping you up at first and then leading to the vegetationlemon pie flavours. If you arent ready for an Islay peat bomb you arent going to be ready for this one. Took me awhile to really appreciate it.Finish Paprika smoke sour candy cherries nutmeg bacon burnt sugar.The finish lasts a decent amount of time and the flavours pop out again under the smoke that stays throughout. Yet again it takes a long time to fish out the different flavours beneath.Conclusion I love smoke and peat and most of all Islay whisky. This is the whisky for me however there is some room for improvement. The smoke takes a LOT of your attention and while thats what I like it is almost one note. You have to try it a few times to just get those currant and citrus flavours. Id recommend anyone who likes big bold smoke to try this and really to anyone who wants to see what the Islay smoke is all about to try this.,Scotch,cmiuhzh,10,t5_2qq65

2486983,0,t3_2o1n65,Ardbeg    Medicinal Ashy Flan Nose Thick vanilla in a pillow of leathery peat with a little fresh seaweed and wood chips.  After a while I get some yellow apple too. Palate Salty leathery peat hits the tip of the tongue entering elsewhere softly like briny caramel custard flan with a followup of char brulee on the tongue and exhaling through the nose like burning leather.  This saltchar peat grows somewhat salty ash and tangy green apple.  But the flan sweetness keeps any of it from being overpowering I like this balance. Finish More noticeably medicinal with lingering leather and vanilla in the back and some salty tang around the edges of the tongue.I really like this quality of peat the leathery kind.  The experience was pretty much everything I expected but more medicinal and a bit more ashtang.  Happily this component is kept in check by the mouthwatering flan sensation.  Although quite good the Ardbeg  is just a bit onedimensional for my tastes. Compared to other prominent entrylevel Islays of heavy peat character...Crisper less industrially dirty than the Laphroaig  better balanced than the Lagavulin  more balanced and better peat quality than Caol Ila  less malty and haylike more vanilla and leather.

2959086,0,t1_co3h9s5,You have mistakenly inferred from what I wrote that I meant wine and liquor were sold in separate stores from each other. What I said was wine and liquor are sold in a separate store from beer which is undoubtedly true. As far as the licenses its a matter of perspective I suppose. If you want a license in NYS you have to buy an existing license from someone. No new licenses are issued so the owner of said license can sell it for whatever they choosewhat the market will bear. If you walked into a highly successful and heavily trafficked store and attempted to buy the storelicense the owner could quote you a price of M of course then its up to the buyer to accept refuse this offer. Basically what I am saying is that there is no baseline price to purchase a license and open a store you are at the mercy of whether or not there is a licensee currently looking to sell which often is not the case and therefore makes the acquisition of a license difficult...and to say that the purchase of a license is easy is downright wrong. I do not know whether I could go to NJ and get a new license issued but as far a price goes its irrelevant in NY if there are no licenses available to purchase.

BampBs especially decent ones were significantly higher everywhere in Scotland when my wife and I toured last fall.The least expensive BampB we were able to book was about  in Campbeltown. Average was in the low s. Islay and Skye were higher than average.Cheaper BampBs do exist but youre going to have to book well in advance and be prepared to make lots of calls. Many of these places only have  rooms each.Our favorite BampB on the whole trip was in Islay at the Bridgend Hotel The rooms are comfortable and the proprietor Charlotte will stuff you well beyond comfort every morning. We had the cheapest room which was   night for doubleoccupancy. Also its relatively close to the Port Ellen distilleries and Laphroaig was our favorite distillery tour.Edit Wanted to add another recommendation. We really liked our stay at Albyn Townhouse in Edinburgh and it was closer to your price range as well.

3412404,0,t3_2zaxr3,This sample was graciously provided by uMentel and completes a trio of Caol Ila offerings I have reviewed.  You can find his review here.I didnt read his review again before writing this  seeing it now this is a sherry bomb and not a fruit bomb as I called it  same thing?This offering is unpeated has no age statement comes in at .  ABV which I assume is cask strength and uMentel reports as costing .  Both of my prior reviews were peated so this will be a slight change of pace.  The glass sat for about an hour before I touched it.   Nose Light Clay Peaches Lemon Meringue Pie Tomatoes Cooked PastaWhen I first smelled this one it was very reminiscent of what I would expect Caol Ila  to smell like without the peat.  Quite young and a little subdued for the proof.  Gratefully the hour in the glencairn brought out some really nice notes.  In my opinion this is a fruit bomb.  What I mistook at first for peaches became a full lemon meringue pie and once that note stuck I found it very difficult to transition away.  After some digging I came up with tomatoes malic acid? and the youthful grains turned up with the scent of pasta.  Later in the tasting the younger nose shows back up. Palate Citrus Pine Grains Peach Lemon Buttercream Icing CakeThe palate makes a great showing of the nose with a lot of sweetness and some spices.  Im very glad they decided to go with a cask strength offering on this one. Finish Dry to the point of being sour fairly long it starts off on a ginger note and develops into darker root vegetables towards the end.The finish is good but there isnt a lot of development.  It makes me quite thirsty as most highproofers do. OverallThis is a very good scotch.  It wont be right for some people and it takes a little work but you can tell a lot of time and care went into its development.  I dont know if the price point is correct.  At  this would be a must buy.  At  I think its a good buy if youre into the style.  The people at Caol Ila definitely know what theyre doing. Rating ,Scotch,cph8m4r,3,t5_2qq65

Overall I like this malt a lot. The sherry influence adds plenty of fruit fudge and spice up front on the nose and the palate but its not overdone and beneath those flavors the earthy springy freshness that I get from the Tobermory  still comes through and gives it a quality that feels distinct to this particular distillery I think the Tobermory  is pretty unique stuff. It is a bit pricey for a  year old but its distinctive and interesting and although its not right at the top of my wish list Id have no qualms about buying myself a bottle. ,Scotch,cpu2n9m,8,t5_2qq65

Thanks to uLetThereBeRck for the sample!There are huge gaps in my scotch knowledge and every time I start getting a feel for a new to me distillery I hear of five more I have to try.  So its not surprising that I didnt know anything about this whisky going into the review no idea if it was a peat bomb sherry bomb or just a nice malty dram.  I could have done some research before pouring but why not make this effectively blind?  Its better not to know if my girlfriend will be avoiding my face all night not a peat fan. Nose Raisins at first.  Given some time to open up juicy berries fruit cake licorice cloves.  Very silky.  After letting it sit longer sugar crystalsPalate Salty cocoa spice.  Dark winey fruits.  Its sweet and a bit dry.  A very meaty center to it nice and rich.  Licorice. Finish Wood dry wines cloves cocoa... mmm vanilla and theres that licorice again. Notes Its been a while since I had a sherry bomb this was an excellent reintroduction.  If I could change one thing Id take out the licorice but I enjoyed the juicy nose the richness on the palate and the finish was excellent.  Im not comfortable rating this from a single sample Id like to spend more time with it...  No idea what availability is like but the only sherry bomb I have in the house is the Macallan CS so perhaps Ill consider picking up a Bennrines expression.,Scotch,cr1agt7,4,t5_2qq65

3955677,0,t3_35qhub,I tend to categorize singlemalt into four categories namely Peated Sherried Both Peated and Sherried Neither Peated nor Sherried. I like to have  open in each category for a little variety or more like  in the Neither category since theres often a little more variety therein. Usually got about  open and currently have about  closed which makes it easy to select one to open to offer the most variety when I finish off a bottle. I tend to have two drinks per evening and my girlfriend will have one or two. However we also drink beer and cocktails. Bottles tend to last about a year. We also like to host friends for dinner and share generously. System works really well for me.

This applies to nonJapanese whiskies as well. Would say a tasting that includes the latest Belgian bottlings or an grain whiskey from South Africa be enough to draw you in?Also for  middling whiskies in a tasting were not talking Benromach  what would be a reasonable price to you? Is  too much for you to sign up or a bargain youd jump on? If you knew that there might be a surprise whisky or two at the end would that change whether youd sign up andor how much youd pay?

Fresh cut cucumber and beef jerky. WeightBody long fast legs cask strength no surprise Some oil and silk on the palate. Palate surprisingly sweet and malty up front. Develops quickly through some intense seaweed and salt water spray. Finish finish is drying. Peppery. Conclusion I would buy one at Christmas if I saw it.

If you like that waxy paper and oily profile of Clynelish then youll likely enjoy Brora.Brora was a distillery inside a distillery almost a bit like Malt Mill inside of Lagavulin. One of the worlds biggest Brora nerds Serge Valentin has an excellent history write up here Also yes the flavour profile of Caol Ila is in many ways quite identical to Port Ellen whether the PE nerds want to admit that or not. People tend to forget that Port Ellen didnt close up shop because it was too wondrous and beautiful to handle it closed up due to inconsistency and poor spirit production values. Thats why some Port Ellen is really quite nice but much of it especially stuff released now and in the past couple of years has been really substandard juice thats riding on the romanticism of a closed distillery from dud barrels.

My  favorite distilleries so far are Lagavulin Ardbeg and Laphroiag Id recommend sampling their various expressions if you like full bodied drams.It sounds like you are a peat fan but maybe not so much a fan of Laphroaigs overpowered burninghospital peat.  Their NAS offerings are quite good and trade off the pungent raw medicinal smoke for a more refined amp nuanced palate and finish. Laphroaig Triplewood or Cairdeas are probably what youre looking for.  Id also recommend giving Ardbeg a whirl and see if its to your liking.  They tend to be more boggymossy smoke as opposed to Lagas keppery beachy smoke and are quite good IMHO. Maybe try to get your hands on some Uigeadail.,Scotch,cu2s28b,2,t5_2qq65

5070644,0,t3_3kgk6r,I did a google search for an image of this whisky and up popped the picture taken by uNotABadassOverHere from his review  years ago.  It is an awesome picture and I want to give credit where credit is due. Glenfiddich    Review ABV Color Jurassic Park AmberNose   Glenlivet  is to apples what Glenfiddich  is to pears.  That is to say that Glenfiddich  is heavy on the fresh ripe pears.  The pears are the dominant note of that traditional Speyside fruitiness but there are others hiding in the background.  I get some apple a hint of citrus and the faintest whiff of sherry fruits.   Other than the pear note Glenfiddich is pretty subtle.  I get some hints of caramel vanilla and sugar cookies.   Palate I wouldnt call it watery but it certainly isnt thick and mouth coating.  Sweet soft and unassuming.  The pears are right there.  I think of pears as a delicate fruit and this is a delicate whisky.  I taste what I smelled.  The sherry cask influence is there but muted as is the bourbon cask influence.  Noticeably missing is any woody note.Finish  I am going to say it is short because there is not wood pepper dryness or bitterness.  I have found one or more of these notes is present in whiskies I have tried with long finishes.  With the Glenfiddich  there is a lingering sweetness and that is all.Impression .  Sadly my impression is basically the same as most peoples impression of this malt but I am going to try and express it in my own way.  I have only had a handful of blended malts but my initial reaction to each was that the distinctiveness had been blended out of them.  I feel the same way about the Glenfiddich .  It is sweet but not too sweet.  It is fruity but not too fruity.  It has the bourbon influences of vanilla butterscotch and shortbread cookies but they are also muted.  Warning philosophy coming  I am the type of person who likes harmony and consensus but I wont censor my opinion to get it.  I have never been the type to try and please everyone because I think it makes one boring.  If you were trying to please everyone with a scotch youd likely come up with Glenfiddich .  It is delicious but it isnt memorable.       ,Scotch,cux7d4w,6,t5_2qq65

5182638,0,t3_3lzp1j,Ive been reflecting on why most of the reviews around here fall into this  pt band. After some self reflection I realized my own reviewing habits contribute to this trend. Namely the whiskies I dont enjoy tend to be one and done. A single glass which I never revisit.

5388576,0,t3_3ou27l,Scotch dudes and dudettes!I come from an alternate universe where the only scotches are Glenlivets between the ages of  and . Gather around my campfire and listen to the story of my drinking life! You may stumble onto a somewhat heretical admission!Glenlivet Nose Lemon and orange citrus emerges immediately from a fresh pour. Then subtle scents of caramel and toffee. A bit of mulling spices to boot if youre hunting for it. Nose is pretty weak with this one. Coming back to it after a few sips I get some baked apple the Peewees Playhouse word of the day for Glenlivet and definitely cinnamon. Better than I initially gave it credit for but I had to work at it.Taste Starts with the familiar apple of Glenlivet  but then becomes more malty and spiced. Definitely caramel and brown sugar on the palate. Tasty. Flavor stays mostly at the tip and top of the tongue. Over the course of the bottle I found myself drawn again and again to the smell and flavor of the classic applesandcinnamon combination. At  this doesnt need any water. Alternate translation Yeah its thin on the mouth. That said its drinkable and comfortable right out of the bottle. Adding water will only cause the malt to become diluted without the benefit of any additional nuance. Finish Quick but mostly pleasant. Nice blast of orange and light chocolate going down. Bigger gulp gives up the oak and the tiniest bit of smokedefinitely didnt detect this on smaller sips. Rebuy Did already after I killed my ml taster and will again. Glenlivet  is a major step up from the in my opinion bland  year old and will occupy the slot on my whiskey shelf for a very tasty but completely unchallenging dram. At less than  this is a good daily sipper.Food Analogy Can of Dennisons Chili. You could eat better but youre not in the mood for any bullshit after the day youve had. Heat it up and go to town.    Glenlivet Nose Straw maltiness butterscotch fig almonds hazelnuts. Theres a lot going on here unlike the . Bitter underripe tangerines seem present to me in a big way. But then theres the inexplicable scent of fresh laundry. Some water brings out some nice aromas of nutmeg and cut grass with the familiar Glenlivet apple making an appearance. Taste A mixed bag here. The initial sip seems woodforward but subsequent tastes bring out those nectarines  peaches from the nose. At the same time the dram is a little medicinal somewhat like oversteeped tea. Water makes it much sweeter now with more tastes of honey and candied nuts though some tart raspberries show up along with baked apple. Definitely more complex than your average Glenlivet but theres a lot here that causes confusion rather than harmony.Finish Harsher than I would have expected and especially so after trying the . The good news is that the  becomes a little more buttery over time... a bit reminiscent of the aftertaste of a good waffle. Its long and warming after the initial shock but rough going down even at . And yet at the very end theres a Robitussinlike quality I dont really enjoy along with some pronounced dryness.  Rebuy Probably not at like  to . The  stands out to me while this does not. The  is as precisely as good as it needs to be for this price point. Glenlivet says this malt is a combination of age and elegance but Im not getting a tremendous amount of depth here that would put it above anything like the Benromach  or Bruichladdich Islay Barley for example that I would say are far more transformative and unified in the tasting experience. Food Analogy Going to one of those buildaburger places and realizing after the second bite of your supposed masterpiece that a fried egg salsa ranch dressing and a slice of pineapple are just not working together.    Glenlivet  NadurraNose Apples immediately. House style anyone? Some white grape and cinnamon. Burying my nose in it gives me the faintest bit of cut grass and earth. Other than that rather uncomplicated. Taste The Nadurra is assertive and brash at full strength but interesting. Sourness slowly begins to evolve into apple cider and mulling spices. Black pepper prickles the middle of the tongue. Theres a tremendous amount of a Glenlivet signature here. Its hot at first but the  ABV sip mellows out fairly quickly. After that point its apples apples apples. Hope you like apples! Id say the Nadurra does benefit greatly from some water. Now you get some extremely bright Jolly Rancher sweetness with a bit of honey. Id say its more flavorful when less of the raw alcohol is doing the talking.Finish Big apples with that Jolly Rancher taste going and going like the energizer bunny. Cinnamon does finally enter into the finish. Very drying on the roof of the mouth. After a while the apple sweetness did strike me as a bit cloying.Rebuy  Cant! But I probably wouldnt roll the dice on the NAS versions if theyre considered to be inferior. The Nadurra is flavorful but it is a onenote flavor to me that can wear out its welcome. Loved the dram I had of this at a restaurant with good company but a whole bottle left me underwhelmed. I think chardonnay drinkers would really appreciate this but chardonnay has never been one of my favorites.Food analogy Living through November rd as a year old. The honeymoon of eating Halloween candy whenever you want has worn off so now the thought of having your fifthmostfavorite chocolate bar for the ninth time fills you with an adult level of exhaustion.     Ultimate verdict Maybe the Glenlivet  is out of this world but I dont think people normally look to Glenlivet for ascendant tastes. The  was a surprise to me and Im not going to say that its lifechanging but of the three most affordable steps up from the  it ticks the widest variety of boxes for me. The  has a better nose and the Nadurra has a longer finish and intensity but its the flavor of the  I like and will buy again.,Scotch,cw0g92y,7,t5_2qq65

5603155,0,t3_3rv8bm,Okay at this point Im pretty convinced that I like writing triplicate reviews organized by theme. Lets put three entrylevel OB highlands on the chopping block for today. Unlike last weeks smattering of awful stuff or shit that I can whiteknight just a little bit here weve got three pretty good drams the Dalmore  the Glen Garioch  and the Glendronach . On one hand I come to associate the Highlands with big bold tastes. However each of these tastes attempt to be big and bold at a pretty reasonable price point in a slightly different way. Lets see how they stack up. Dalmore  Nose  Honeycomb milk chocolate bread pudding toasted coconut and pistachios. Theres also a wonderful smell of caramelized bananas with nutella. Coming back to it after a few sips it now has a boozy kind of raisin scent with a slight hint of anise. Water brings forth a little glazed orange and makes this more fruitforward.Taste   Big bitter chocolate with tobacco and leather. As you roll it around on the tongue youre treated with more dark chocolate. Then a bit of plum dates and raisin just before the finish. Repeated sips grant some faint wisps of orange and vanilla. I think its wonderful. I didnt want to add water to this but I did for the sake of the full experience. Even after its pleasingly bitter. Theres still tobacco and cocoa but just a tad bit of grapefruit just at the tip of the tongue. Water makes this mellow without being flavorless or boring.  Finish Water or no honey mixes with a little bit of bitter chocolate. Its dry and slightly astringent but not unpleasantly so. Perhaps a little thin here.Rebuy  Ive had a lot of other things people said were as good as the Dalmore  or better but this is still a winner to me at . I cant argue with my palate and I know that Dalmore is villified along with Diageo for coloring and chillfiltering and the whole gamut but even after all of those indignities the Dalmore  comes out as damned good juice for the price point. I will cede the point that if the  was put on the market as an NCF noncolored cask strength version I would hurl money at it. As a Ninja Turtle Michaelangelo. Sure hes onedimensional and could make a lot of different life decisions but at the end of the day hes someone you can depend on. But maybe more importantly where you might see an awesome twirling weapon youd have a good time swinging around some cynic can always come along and say its just two sticks attached to a length of rope. The world is big enough for both of you to be right..  Glen Garioch Nose Intriguing. Malty caramel with cornbread and marzipan nuttiness. Its rubbery as well with a bit of leather. Later a bit of peanut brittle. Nevertheless I keep getting notes that are similar to grain whiskey.Taste  Sweet caramel but hot on the palate at . At full strength I find it a bit grainy with some mustiness and earth. Its hard to get past the alcohol even on the second sip. Im thinking that maybe this dram would benefit from some more time in the barrel. Adding water makes this much more agreeable. It absolutely positively benefits from water. Now Im getting buttercream cake frosting angels food cake and demerara sugar. There are some larger bourbony tastes that dont have the residual sourness of most bourbons. These are good dessert tastes. Not pop tarts mind you high end stuff youd get from a restaurant. Balvenie  drinkers form a line Id say for a bourbonlike Scotch this is better. Nevertheless I keep thinking that this had to be bottled at  to get the same flavor that most drams are putting out at  or less. Finish Very hot at  with lingering maple syrup at this strength. Afterwards it turns grainy and peppery. It sits on the tongue and comes across as dry with water or without but doesnt give me a long warmth at the back of my throat. Its a little disappointing.Rebuy Rebuy Probably not. Its certainly not bad but theres too much thats great at this price point. Pleasing but not  pleasing. In my local market its the most expensive of the three bottles reviewed here. We root for the underdog when we know theyre capable of taking the big dogs on headtohead. Here?  ....well. Uh.As a Ninja Turtle... Raphael. Okay so youre the upstart and constantly run your mouth about how youve got all of the answers and how nobody likes Leonardo. Still your smug sense of superiority never stops you from getting your ass kicked. .  Glendronach Nose Dates coconuts raisins and mulling spices. Coming back to it I get tart grapefruit with cinnamon and vanilla. Burnt sugar. Carmelized banana. Theres also a little bit of potpourri in there as well. Among all of these flavors is a nice biscuity malty scent. This is really something you can dig your nose into and explore.Taste A big sherry hit no buts about it. Raisins and plums and a very chewy mouthfeel. Theres some wonderful burnt sugar as it rolls around on the tongue. As I dig into this theres also some dried fruit on the order of apricot and papaya. This isnt hot at all and sip turns into sip. Adding a little water brings just a touch of licorice  anise into the mix and its quite welcome. I think in comparison to its yearold brother theres a little bit more playfulness and complexity that I like a tad more. Truly a hugely flavored sip you want to experience again and again.  Finish I immediately noticed a burst of cinnamon. I like that this is warming without being abrasive. The fruit and wine on the back half of the palate fades to the background to make room for spice and rum. About the only knock I have against the Glendronach  is a small sour note lurks in the background which I usually get from sherried whiskeys but its no mortal sin and less than that of its contemporaries.Rebuy Undoubtedly. Great value at  and at  NCF with no colorant. My friend and I were turned onto this at KampL when the spirits buyer for the Hollywood store said People arent drinking this... and we have no idea why. Id say it slightly outbats the  in terms of a valuetotaste ratio. I bought a whole bottle after a friend and I split it killed it a few months back and Ill be replacing it soon.As a Ninja Turtle Shredder. Youve seen ninjas and youve seen spikes but heres an example of something becoming more than the sum of all of its parts. Everyone loves Shredder.

5753141,0,t3_3tydra,Laphroaig  Islay  ABVLaphroaigmaybe more so the Quarter Cask than the  but the  definitely played a huge partrepresents my first Islay love.  Being able to first experience the peaty smack in the face that Laphroaig represents was one of the first major steps in my evolution as a drinker of single malts beyond Glenlivet  Glenfiddich  and the like and for that Laphroaig has my eternal gratitude.So I went about my merry whiskydrinking way until a year ago when my wife bought me a bottle of Lagavulin  for Christmas and I realized just how much more there was to Islay than just my beloved Laphroaig.  Since then Ive quite enjoyed offerings from Bruichladdich and Caol Ila in addition to Laphroaig and Lagavulinwhich brings me to Ardbeg which in terms of both an age statement and a price point has the most comparable entrylevel product to the Laphroaig .  I must applaud Ardbeg for its steadfast refusal to chill filter or artificially color even its entrylevel expression Laphroaig does both IIRC although for its other expressionsQC PX Triple Wood etc. it does not and the absence of chill filtering was eminently noticeable in the process of producing this sidebyside review.Well start with the Laphroaig Nose The expected odors of peat iodine and earth but equally remarkable are the strong notes of bandaids sea salt and surprisingly rye.  Mostly exactly what youd expect from the Froggy .Body Quite pleasant but admittedy light relative to the big brash flavors that its packing but for a more subtle whisky the body would be perfectly appropriate.  It definitely doesnt have the fullness of Ardbeg.Palate More of the same medicinal peat from the nose plus some black pepper brine seawater and smoke.  Islay through and through.Finish The sea salt from the nose returns to make for a saltandpepper finish although the peat really does dominate throughout.  Theres a reason it gets referred to so frequently as a peatbomb and that title is wellearned.Price Right nowUSD  at the nearest Total Wine which is really rather steep it used to be  not too long ago.  Boo.  It also means its now a few bucks more expensive than the Ardbeg  which isnt ideal.Overall I love sushi and I sort of think of Laphroaig and more broadly the Islay peated potions in general as the mackerel of scotchits definitely not for everyone and its taste is unmistakable but it has a deservedly devoted following.  Laphroaig  is the biggest in that go big or go home camp of Islay whiskies and my inclination when presented with a glass of it is to go big.  Ardbeg  Islay  ABVAs I noted earlier Im a recent convert to Ardbeg but even in its entrylevel expression its easy to see the differences imparted between it and Laphroaig or Lagavulin Caol Ila etc.  The lack of chill filtering makes the biggest difference in the body and mouthfeel but theres also simply a definite discernable difference in the role the peat plays between the twoNose Much earthier than LaphroaigLaphroaig really is all about the medicinal notes but Ardbeg seems earthier to me.  Fewer bandaid odors more salty and mossy smells along with some loamy soil notes.  After letting it sit for a while a few faint wisps of vanilla extract or birthday cake emerge adding a surprisingbut relatively slightveneer of sweetness.Body Superlatively goodthere is definitely more heft and feel to it in this department than Laphroaig and because of the higher ABV and absence of chill filtering it is very easy to see why.Palate Lots and lots of sea salt and seaweed but also some seriously oily savory notes that almost taste like olive oil that has been used to saute a protein like fish or pork which along with the oily mouthfeel might be the best part of the dramits seriously delicious.  Some malt and smoke round things out quite nicely.Finish The salt continues to run roughshod over the whole thing almost to the point of being a detriment.  But after the salt does its thing the earthy slightly sweet notes from the nose return and linger a goodly length without much burn which more than makes up for the overly salty transition.Price USD  at the same Total Wine outlet was  until recently.  Still good value for the money though especially as Islay whiskies go beyond cult status and become increasingly popular but a  price hike still doth sucketh.Overall The depth imparted by the oiliness of Ardbeg is what ultimately convinced me of its quality and character and at least relative to the Laphroaig  it just tips the scales in its favor.  I still love Laphroaig and will continuing loving them for as long as they keep cranking out the quality peatbombs but let this be a lesson chill filtration makes scotch worse.  ,Scotch,cxa8dbn,4,t5_2qq65

5822660,0,t1_cxis1kz,Hey I am from the area and have similar taste! Have them try a bottle of Clynelish  The short reason is that the Lagavulin  is peat made strange and interesting by fruit from the sherry casks. The Clynelish  is the flip side of the coin. It is fruity made strange by peat on the after. If you want to stay closer to home give them a bottle of Laphroaig Quarter Cask. Not too expensive the standard peaty Laphroaig but aged in quarter sized casks for a higher interplay of the oak with the stack.

The thing is according to the SWA they cant even if they wanted to. I think it is disgusting that the SWA came down on Compass Box for disclosing the ages and percentages of Lux and Flaming Heart.

I promised to be punctual in reviewing them I am dubious that I succeeded but here are the results.Mystery A Initial Impressions a nice mild malt with a sherry influence Nose as noted above beyond this the impression is one of freshness a clean green oak twig. Freshly dug earth for a second there I lost the sherry and thought I smelled peat. Cereal grains  Post shredded wheat cereal Taste Speyside apples with a mild sherry cask influence. A nip of sulfur a bit of baking spice.  Finish a mild to medium burn thats some cinnamon and some black pepper. Fruit salad fades through a few oaky tannins to a sherry sulfur aftertaste.Its scotch. There not all that much more to say for it. Theres nothing bad to say about it even though sherry cask isnt my own personal favorite. An easy drinker to be sure. The only distinctive that I picked out was that sense of freshness. As I worked my way to the bottom it persisted there were a few sips with a taste of fresh picked wildflowers.Score Guessing games  .  proof. Speyside. Sherry Cask.  yearsTheres just too many to choose from foregoing a guessOK nevermind I cheated and looked at his inventory. Official Guess Cragganmore Mystery   Initial Impression mildly peated Nose a ton of ethanol up front getting around that sorry I know we hate that tasting notes that mention smooth and alcohol burn. Starting over then...  Mild earthen peat with a bit of brown sugar.  Lemons too and some kind of oak. Taste earthy peat with a sweet entry and a goodly burn on the midpalete.  Finish surprisingly brief. It is consistent with whats gone before  that same peat earth and a hint of fruit lemon. But its gone very quickly leaving only an aftertaste with a bit of peaty smoldering lemons.Not a lot going on here but I do enjoy a peated scotch so a bit of a bump up in score. Its warming and pleasant Id happily drink a ton of it.Score  Official Guess One of the Kilchoman  Islay releases bourbon barrel  proof.Please do take note that I created this second guess before peeking at the inventory.

6201462,0,t3_40j5av,Review  Jura I had never had any Jura before this pour at a hotel bar in Copenhagen but I tend to like Island malts quite a bit.  I find them to be high quality and each has something different to offer.  They also tend to have a funk to them like Islay and Campbeltown whiskies.  Jura seems to be polarizing to the people of rscotch with the haters describing the scent and flavor as sweaty socks so lets see what shes all about.DKK    .ozNose  Opium sea spray apricot caramel soft sweet grains yeasty funk floral vanilla a whiff of cinnamon indistinguishable red sherry fruits.  I can see why people think this smells like feet but being a more shall we say experienced person I readily recognized opium as a major scent in this with some nice yeasty scents like youd find in a fino or amontillado sherry and then some nice fruits spices and flowers.  Very nice for .Palate  Thin silky.  Caramel salted leather apricots coffee peanut brittle buttered walnuts ancho chile opium tobacco.  Delicious it gets really salty as it goes but I love that in a whisky so I dont mind.Finish  Medium length warming to hot very drying.  Peanut brittle salt soft grains dry oak rounded out with a whiff of smoke.The Verdict  I really like this.  It has a watery mouthfeel and the finish is hot but I really like it.  I may have to search out some IBs at  and UCF.  I can see why its polarizing with some really unusual flavors but I like me some funk.  Awhile back I set myself a quasigoal of trying as many different distilleries as possible and at points it has felt like more of a grind and less of a pleasurable hobby especially stumbling through a plethora of uninspired Speyside whiskies.  If youve reached that point like I did this is a great whisky to search out for a very different experience.Score  ,Scotch,cyujg3d,4,t5_2qq65

6605101,0,t3_4658x4,Howdy Reddit! Buckle up because its time for some WHITE KNUCKLE reviewing. This time three Island whiskeys have CALLED DOWN THE THUNDER so now its time for them to face the storm. Do these three whiskeys BRING THE HEAT? Does anyone know a computer repair center that can help with the RANDOMIZED ITALICS that seem to be happening here?Arran Nose  Fermented apple with honey and caramel. A little bit of candle wax that should appeal to Clynelish fans. Water brings out a bit of chopped parsley. Taste Good viscosity. Apple and oak spice arrive at the same time for a very nice onetwo punch. Rolling it around in the mouth brings out more honey. Theres a little bit of cedar and aromatic wood here as well. Note that theres a mealy quality that really does remind me of Korean pears. Thats not a bad thing if you like that texture and expect it with the taste though its unusual to be reminded of it in a liquid.Finish Warming and brandylike with apple and cinnamon tingling the roof of the mouth. A big burst of oak as well. These casks must be pretty active! The only negative is that there is a little bit of a cloying component on the exit thanks to that honey.  Rebuy Unqualified yes. Didnt like the  but as a fan of the Glenlivet s applecinnamon onetwo this is a more mature take on orchard fruit flavors. Also  NCF and at a pretty appealing price point of about .  Equivalent Manly Flavor Assault Six Delta Force operators vigorously snacking on Korean pears as they rappel down the side of a building.  Talisker Distillers EditionNose  Smoked meats for sure. Good waves of seaweed mulch and a little bit of baking chocolate. Eucalyptus for sure! Just a bit floral on the nose. Lingering. I can still smell it in my nostrils even with the glass on the coaster. Tingly! Taste A perfect marriage of flavors. Theres beef brisket smoke earthy peat and brine. However theres a beautiful transition from savory to sweet as the drink shifts to pastry cream and chocolate mousse. Water makes the drink a little more umamilike with the initial tastes reminding me a bit of sweet seafood like panseared scallops. Easy to enjoy but complicated enough to pay attention to.Finish Gentle. Just a little smoky a little spicy a little salty. Ends finally with nice winelike tannins leaving a dry finish on the sides of the tongue.   Rebuy Yes. To me this is a great example of peat being used to enhance flavors rather than steal the show. Pricey for an year old whiskey but worth it to me. Note that some may find this to be oversherried especially those who consider themselves peat heads to the point where too much becomes just enough. To my tastes the Talisker is a bold enough spirit to be able to stand up to the Amaroso finishing beautifully. Equivalent Manly Flavor Assault A laserguided hellfire missile filled with peat and brisket striking its target. Jura SuperstitionNose   Ahh that familiar Jura funk. A little barnyard. Fresh cut hay. Skunky. Slightly pizzalike with combinations of mushrooms and breakfast sausage. Some damp tobacco. Interesting! Taste The peat shows up only near the middletoend in the form of ash. This is by far the ashiest whiskey Ive had to date. Additionally theres kind of a bitter acrid taste in there thats oddly appealing in a masochistic kind of way. Odd combinations of metals minerals grass and flowers that border on the dishsoapy. To make this a little more cordial and marry some of the odd flavors together Id recommend a splash of water to bring the sweetness forward. Finish Characteristic Jura heat comes through at the back of the throat. Initially theres another blast of ash but after the spirit goes down theres actually a very pleasant tingling on the roof and bottom of the mouth that lasts for quite a long time. The tingling cinnamon and clove spice just goes and goes. Best part about this dram.Rebuy Probably not. Its interesting but I wouldnt call it good given the copious amounts of offnotes. I enjoyed my time with it but its very very hard to recommend. Hey man try this one. It tastes like ash and like putting your tongue on the terminals of a ninevolt battery.Equivalent Manly Flavor Assault Biting into a chicken parmigiana MRE.

I was warned that I shouldnt buy a whole bottle before I was sure I would like it but I am extremely pleased with the flavor this bottle has. I tried some Johnnie Walker Black and found the slightest hint of smokey goodness in the finish and wanted more. I think my original desires for scotch are summed up in the experience I have had with Laphroaig QC. About a year ago I decided to try scotch for the first time. I was happy with the Glenfiddich  I got but wanted something more from it. I think I found that here taken neat at room temperaturePrice AVB Color A darker amber than some other scotches I have had possibly related to it being nonchill filtered.Nose Oak Leather bonfire smoke mild vanilla salted caramel fertile soil. Overall a kick to the nostrils when I first scented it.Palate Slight medicinal taste Like the stuff is good for me! salted caramel a gentle spiciness more smoke. The mouthfeel is affected by the increased ABV but feels warm and smooth. The powerful flavor compared to the more gentle speysides I have had was a welcome change.Finish I didnt expect how long the smoky leather finish would stay with me. Vanilla sea spray light oak flavor.My profile may be clouded by the increased alcohol in this bottling as I didnt mix this with any water. However I am incredibly impressed with the smoke ocean tones and length of the finish. This is easily my favorite scotch so far.I would rate this scotch at an  on my variable sliding scale of subjective relation to other scotches.Slainte fellow Scotch fans!Edit My most sincere apologies for misspelling Laphroaig.

7016736,0,t3_4brgcg,Ive had very few whiskies from the Balblair distillery. And personally I think Im missing out.So before we get into the whisky I need to ask myself Why is that? Well probably due to my own biases.I love Islays and Lowlands. A lot. They are tasty as heck to me. And I tend to not enjoy Highland Whisky that much. Or put much stock in Whisky books or awards.And then comes along Balblair . A whisky that has won many an award and was even in both of the whisky books Im working through.Its NAS with a year to tell us which Vintage it is.  So half NAS I guess. Or maybe Im missing when it was released and therefore I dont know the age. Please correct me and since this is the internet call me a jackass and do it in a negative tone.EDIT I have been corrected its  years old.Its from a region Im not too fond of. Its nonchill filtered and has no colour added though. Yet its not cask strength.So Im at an impasse. Theres some red flags. Not she screams out daddy in bed kinda red flags more so all of her female friends have only known her a year kinda red flag. Or for those of you who date men not the he says hed kill everyone if I left him kinda red flag more so the he gets angry at random moments kinda red flag.But maybe just maybe I should. So I bought a sample last summer and now have time to try it. So lets see how it tastes shall we?Price NA at the LCBORegion HighlandAbv Colour .Y Nose Mango cereal corn syrup honey caramel pudding peach cobbler ginger peanutWow. Im actually surprised. Big nose on this. Takes some time to grow really. Very syrupy like sex with a maple tree joke stolen from CaH.Given some time and patience the sweet complex side comes out. Its really quite sweet.Taste Orange peach peppery cereal lemongrassSo two things I can see why people love this. The mouth feel is great. Thick even. Not too hot. More fruit like before and the lemongrass is always a complex nice treat.Thats the only thing complex about it though. It doesnt match the nose for complexity. Its consistent though. And that mouth feel is like oil but in a good way not a Im dying in tar way.Finish Caramel salt lemon wood coriander pepperarugula smokeAnd the finish amps it up a little. The wood notes arent over done and any combination of salt and caramel is so hot right now. Dont believe me? Check out the yogurt section some time.Again not as complex as the nose yet its well balanced and the little wisps of smoke at then end are nice. Im guessing thats from some random thoughts in my head taking wood influence to be smoke rather than anything else.Conclusion So this surprised me. First off the rd edition of Balblair  is actually a higher proof than older versions. And thats after they won awards. So Im impressed.Also the nose is really a treat for a sweet lover like myself. Really enjoyed it.So is it worth having? Id say yes. Its a good dram all around. nice dram. The kind of whisky you can give to a snob like me or a newbie and they will both find things to love.So I was wrong. Gotta try more Balblairs moving forward.

7026240,0,t3_4bvfqn,Bruichladdich Port Charlotte  Scottish Barley Heavily Peated Scotch NASAnd now for something completely different from my previous review Glenfiddich  Bourbon.  From the fruity and bourbony sweetness of the Glenfiddich  comes a very young Id imagine around  years maybe a tad bit younger very powerful very aggressive Islay.  My first Bruichladdich the Port Charlotte Heavily Peated distilled with all Scottish Barley if the labeling is to be believed.  Bottled at  ABV  Proof it promises to be aggressive.  With PPM Peat it promises to be very peaty smoky.  It promises to be a burning hospital fire drink.  And I do like nay love agressive Islays.  Alright here we go Scotchit.Nose Peat though not monster peat.  Iodine Seaspray   Water Seafood BBQ Roasted Shrimp muted peat citrusCompared to Glenfiddich the Nose is rather simple but powerful.  But theres a more meat to it so to speak.  Lots of Peat but not overwhelmingly so.  Add water and you get more of seafoodshrimp BBQ than the toffees and caramels that the website suggests.  But roasted shrimp is very sweet on its own so it maybe more of that to you.  I get more seafood sweetness than dessert sweetness.Palate Really sweet fruity peat smoke Firey and peppery.  Water Less smoke but still present slightly oily turns more medicinal.Peat continues to makes its presence felt.  Really firey and peppery at the end revealing its higher than average ABV.  With water the smoke is muted somewhat and more iodine comes through.  Its firey and peppery.  Simple perhaps but its an Islay with heavy peat.  While not Peat Monster its peaty and smoky and it lives up to its name.  With some fruit flavors its sweet smoke and bbq on the seaside.Finish Peaty Smoke shrimp bbq seaweed soup peppery warm enjoyable  Water sweet warming finish long warming sweet and smoky seaweed? Sweet and leatheryThe finish is where the character really shines.  Shrimp BBQ Seaweed soup.  Peppery Finish gives away to rather long and enjoyable warm finish with smoke lingering on and on and on.  With water finish becomes warm and sweeter.  And adds a touch of sweetness and leathery finish.Grade AFirst of my reviews to break the A Barrier.  Sweet with a bit of BBQ in my mouth.  Its coherent from start to finish.  It lets you know that its smoky and sweet on the nose and palate reveals that smoke and sweetness throughout.  The finish is long and warm even with water.  And its still smoky and sweet.  And it lingers on and on.  Damn this is good stuff.  Simple and coherent and thats what makes this a winner in my book palate and liver.  NAS but damned if this thing wasnt delicious.Edit Sweet Cajun Fire if I had to sum it up in  words or less.,Scotch,d1cs004,7,t5_2qq65

7105073,0,t3_4cvldl,In my last multireview of  Glenmorangies I promised to follow up with the recently release Milsean.  So here it is!  I will also add it to that earlier thread for documentation.Expectations Ive noted the decline in the Private Editions but this one intrigued me because I do tend to like whiskies on the sweeter side.  This turned out not to be as sweet as hyped certainly not like a rum and unfortunately its just not that interesting.Glenmorangie Milsean Nose Mostly a normal malt smell but weak Vanilla and hay sweetened by honey but also dried by a chalkiness.  There is also gingerlime tingle and the wine cask brings a faint berry smell lets say like old red Twizzlers. Palate There is a thin honeywater feel tasting like sweet hay with a tart lemongrapefruit and ginger tingle. These intensify midpalate with more hay and a big oakyhot ginger and lime fizz that overpowers most of any redberriedness.  Finish The oaky ginger heat subsides and then not much lingers but some grassy honey.Imagine you had a limeginger amp raspberry soda which has mostly gone flat but still has a little fizz and then you mixed some of it into the Glenmorangie  Original.  The Milsean does not bring any leap in quality rather it makes a small variation on the underlying spirit just like the core range.  Its not bad its much better than the Tusail and it would be a fine casualsipper for half the price but a definite pass for enthusiasts.Similar Malts Glenmorangie yo Original Glenmorangie Nectar DOr Glencadam  Portwood Glen Moray  Chardonnay Cask Tomintoul  Portwood.,Scotch,d1lqepa,6,t5_2qq65

7142050,0,t3_4ddnmv,Glen Grant is a Speyside distillery that has put out a lot of very old and very sherried malts in addition to their standard OB range that is the best selling single malt in Italy. Ive always been interested in trying their stuff given that reputation though their current OB range doesnt seem to excite anyone. years old bottled at .Nose  Vanilla malt like what youd get from DQ pineapple ginger clove almonds black pepper maybe a hint of smoke or char in the background. Really really sweet almost overwhelmingly so. Water brings out a bit of drying oakiness.Palate  Quite a bit drier and spicier than the nose suggests. Ginger and black pepper are most prominent with vanilla a bit of honey and golden apples. Medium body though it feels almost a bit sticky.Finish  Ginger honey black pepper and a hint of lemon. Fairly spicy but still pretty well balanced. Water tones down the spice but doesnt change much.This is pretty nice but I guess I still need to try one of those old sherried ones Glen Grant is known for.  This is still a pretty nice bourbon matured Scotch that hits all the notes it should but theres nothing terribly memorable about it.,Scotch,d1pz3yn,2,t5_2qq65

Id say hes around for at least  months contractually or until BF is satisfied they have a suitable replacement. In the shortterm  months I dont think a lot will change. Longerterm I think the things people are worried about will start to happen Id guess that BF will want to Macallanize GlenDronach and Livetize the rest.

It could be batch variation or just the fact that it is perhaps a divisive malt for one reason or another.  Funny story with this one. I had a small sample oz after having a few other small pours and I enjoyed this quite a bit.  Several nights later I poured myself the same sample and I didnt like it as much as I recalled.  I could taste the youth which is fine but Im not sure how I would score this one.  I think I need another sample.  I think mid s is a fair score.  If I had scored it the first time I would have given middle to upper s and the second time low s to high s.  So odd.  Could just be fluctuating tastes too from one day to the next.   I think I need more time with this malt.   Overall though Im leaning towards liking it. ,Scotch,d505ly0,2,t5_2qq65

But for those like myself who dont know too much about this this Octomore is  years old and was aged in Limousin Oak from Acquitaine that once held one of the worlds greatest eaux de vie.  As it is an X. this was a travel retail exclusive. ampnbspRested  minutes  Glencairn with a bit of waterampnbsp Region Islay Colour StrawampnbspNose Neat  Very strong and almost a little overpowering with a blast of spirit.  Allowed to breathe a bit this settles down with notes of a nice gentle cherrywood coal fire used for a BBQ bit of wet plaster.  With water this opens up some.  Pepper herbal note salted and candied citrus rind. Exotic spice mix I cant put my finger on.  Taste Neat  Incredibly gentle for cask strength.  Lovely oily mouthfeel. Smoke brine BBQed meat.  With water intense BBQed meat vanilla extract.  With time mellows out relatively but still pretty intense some sort of stone fruit and some citrus fruit stewed in cognac.Finish Neat  Blast of fresh smoke some brine pear juice and a dryness to this that is refreshing. With water cognac more smoke and BBQed meat faint pear.  Nice contrast of sweet and saltysavoury notes.Conclusion Ive somehow managed to shield myself from pretty much any knowledge of the Octomores up until now.  Not really sure how that happened.  I could see myself becoming an Octowhore as my first love were peat bombs.  So incredibly put together and all the pieces work very well in harmony.

Surprisingly the initial notes I get are malt and citrus. The dried fruit notes and spices from the sherry influence come later. The nose is pretty closed not as expressive with some sharp alcohol notes that dissipate after  minutes or so. Quite balanced though the flavours seem more reserved tastewise. Dry and peppery finish. Purely speculating but weaker casks in the mix this time around maybe?ampnbspComparisons to Batch  previously reviewed hereThe variance between batches is quite interesting to see. While Batch  was loaded with bold PXheavy sweet and fruity notes Batch  skews towards more oloroso influence with its dry and spicy notes.  Ive gone back and forth between this one and batch  to see if I have a preference but its pretty close. I think I give a slight edge to Batch  for being more memorable the more expressive nose the bursts of fruit and sweet stickiness though the sherry notes in Batch  feel more in line with the Glendronach core range. At the end of the day it will likely come down to personal preference. They are both good... just contrasting sherry experiences.

You will find some good deals on some quality intro scotches but by and large better will often mean more expensive.  This is for several reasons not the least of which is that it is an import.  The scotches most starters have tried and decided they like bourbon more are really basic starter stuff.

I even went so far as to ask a few of the more knowledgeable scotch salesmen if anyone else hated the Corry as much as I do. They shrugged and said it was just a matter of taste and as the Romans used to say in the matter of taste there is no dispute. So here I sit with a slightly opened bottle of Ardbeg Corry from which I will take minute samples now and then just to remind me of how much I dont like it. I used to live in DC. CalvertWoodly and some place over in Georgetown used to be very good places to buy. I went up to Baltimore on occasion but generally went to those places where they were making their own craft beer.

All the taste descriptions were of smoke BBQ leather and while those were certainly present they werent the main flavor and I wasnt terribly impressed with the peat flavor itself. However after spending a few months with the bottle I acquired a taste for it and its now one of my favorite scotches.  My advice is to invest in a bottle and come back to it every once in a while.

9416107,0,t3_59m1q2,Laphroaig Scotchit Review  | Whisky Network Review Here are my thoughts on my first Islay single malt! Sample courtesy of ubuckydeanABV Served Glencairn neat. Rested  minutesColor Light goldNose wow... heavy smoke. Its vegetal in nature. I cant really get anything other than the smoke. But it wafts up in waves rather than being a single stagnant note.Taste Kinda neutral not really sweet or spicy. Just smokey. Swishing pops up strong hits of that vegetal peat and a hint of oak.Finish Medium. It taste like I drank just the smoke component of smoked meat. Not an artificial smoke or even a bonfire.Score Thoughts I knew this was a heavily peated Scotch. I was expecting some other flavors along with it but didnt detect much. Its not love at first taste but I do find it interesting. Its not like any other smoke Ive experience. This isnt wood fire smoke or liquid smoke. Its closer to smoking a cigar than any food example I can think of. Like a cigar the joy comes from swirling the whisky around and letting the smoke play across the palate. Ill be looking to add a bottle of something peated to my whisky collection. I feel like I should try a few other Islays first though. ,Scotch,d99k2cs,4,t5_2qq65

9555830,0,t3_5bsuve,Thanks to uSchockwaves for this sampleSo close to  Scotch reviews. But why arent I reviewing something ridiculous like a exArrack cask Scotch that was aged in the Hebrides after having cherrywood smoke used to dry the malt.But lets get away from my insane fever dream of a whisky and get to why oh why I chose to review Mortlach  Gordon amp MacPhail so close to my milestone reviews?Normally I do review a lot of high ends whiskies when I come close to my divisible by  review numbers. However in the past few years I kept swapping for a variety of samples. Some I planned to do large multi reviews. Some I wanted to do by themselves.None the less I ended up with about  minis that needed to be done. My wife who is ever so patient explained I may want to catch up.To help this out I resorted my entire collection in an order of groups of similar whiskies trying to make it so I went through highs and lows.And as the smart person who understands and loves numbers I of course completely disregarded which ones would be my milestone whiskies.Thats not to say that Mortlach  Gordon amp Macphail isnt a special dram. This whisky is bottled by Gordon amp MacPhail and was the closest thing you could get to an OB Mortlach for awhile.And what an interesting dram. Its aged in refill and first fill sherry casks. Theres talk that Mortlach specifically gave GampM the rights to sell it. The bottles themselves look very different than the stag headed bottling that GampM does.And now that Mortlachs are quite pricey to try its interesting to see one that wasnt that expensive and try it.Also I couldnt get to any other samples. So... thats why.But lets not worry about numbers for the moment and get on with the review.Price NA at the LCBORegion SpeysideAbv Colour YR Nose Raisin orange light brown sugar cinnamonginger lemon rind thymeThis is rich enough that smelling it goes right to my hips. But heck what doesnt these days.The sherry note is evident as you could imagine from the mental image of my hips. Lots of spice raisin and Xmas notes. Somewhere between good homemade cranberry sauce and healthy cranberry sauce without the cranberry elements.Taste Brown sugar anise extract mint raisin ginger underripe pineappleSpicy. Quite spicy. However thats about all. Save for a flavour that tastes off. Something that signals not ready to eat yet or this fruit wants you to wait. Which I always do as Im a gentleman. Its strong enough over time to take over the seemingly stronger spice elements that dominate the taste.Not fun.Finish Lemon cranberry black tea underripe kiwiFinishes quite bitter which Im known for whinging about. Has this acidic bitter flavour that is overpowering. A little bit of bitterness is good. Nothing but bitterness and Im out.Conclusion All in all an interesting dram that has suffered from either too much water bringing out the rougher elements or too much sherry influence erasing the Scotch elements.Mortlachs are worth trying. They can be hit or miss. Its the nature of the juice. This one exemplifies that belief for me. The nose is quite nice as long as you want something heavily sherried. The rest becomes too spicy and too bitter.Id try this one before you buy.Scotch review  Speyside review  Whisky Network review Other Mortlach reviews Mortlach   Signatory Cask Strength  Mortlach   Vintage Signatory Unchillfiltered  Mortlach  Gordon amp MacPhail  Mortlach  Blackadder Raw Cask  Mortlach SMWS .

Most of my experience with virgin oak casks have been with peated spirits so this should be fun.   Nose You can smell the virgin oak right off the bat. Tons of vanilla cinnamon sweetness oak spice. Reminds me of a bourbon hints of cherry. Brown sugar.  Palate Sweet oak black pepper rye spice cinnamon vanilla. Heat from the alcohol. Apples and cherries. Nutty with some caramel.  Finish Little bit dry spicy with lots of oak. Medium in length. Pepper also present. Still some sweetnessvanilla though less than on nose and palate. Some bitterness from the wood to add balance.

I picked this bottle up at the Oban distillery this summer after tasting their lineup and feeling like it stood head and shoulders above the core line. They first matured their spirit in the same exbourbon casks used for the yo. They then finished the spirit in specially charred casks to enhance woody flavors before marrying in another type of cask. It is approximately  years old. While this may all sound a bit vague its about all the information I could get out of the staff! Release limited to  bottles you may feel a bit of sticker shock at . Color Honey yellow.Nose Spiced apple cider. Burnt orange. Sweet vanilla. Very distant smoke.Palate Pepperiness with a bit of salt. Creamy rich. Green apple spices some dark chocolate. Floral and vanilla. More green apple.Finish Moderate to long. Lingering apples and oranges. Warming. A hint of sweetness and smoke is all that remains a minute or two later.  General Impression Very good and complex. While it certainly has the unmistakable Oban character this is a different beast to the yo. It is perfectly bottled at . If you make the trek out to Oban I highly recommend asking for a taste and considering this bottle its a unique and delicious Oban offering.

ABVFor a while many people have suggested I may find some interest in Ledaigs take on peat. Im excited to see what all of the fuss is back.Color Deep goldNose Dirt sherry fruit plum forest fire very mineral heavy and oddly field like more grassy than floralTaste Oily mouth feel and instantly smokey. Kind of an oatmeal note. Sherry is very prominent with fig date plum. Apples raspberry jam. Burning things  very mineral heavy and very woody. Not ashy but a very strong forest note with wood and smoke and herbal grassy peat. Like a goddamn forest fire. This is really something elseFinish Long thick and rich. full of smoke but also well blended with the added complexity of the sherry.Overall This is crazy unique and also crazy good. Im really enjoying how the peat here is presented  very prominent and different from other big peat bombs. The sherry plays along very very well and makes the dram thick rich and syrupy. All in all Im a fan. Im giving this a Rank  and Im now feeling an urge to pick up a bottle.TWAT REPELLANT For those that may notice the words price  and expensive in my reviews and therefore feel their panties beginning to bunch fear not.

10216126,0,t3_5magm1,Review  Bruichladdich The Classic LaddieSample courtesy of uEthanized. Thanks again! Image borrowed from Bruichladdich.The whisky Part of Bruichladdichs core range this is an unpeated single malt that was matured in American oak casks. Non age stated but I could give you more info on what went into this bottle with the bottle code and Laddies website. Bottled at  abc non chill filtered and has no added color. This is a dram I have no experience with previously.Nose Sweet grain treacle nuttiness lemon zest toffee.Taste Bitter oak green apple salted crackers seaweed citrus creamy marzipan dry vanilla bean. Light alcohol burn sets in late. The dram is a lot more savory than the nose indicated. No one flavor stands out there is a variety of flavor experiences for me on my palate.Finish Long oak mostly which leaves quite a bit of bitterness for me. Slight salt and citrus.Yum! I liked this quite a bit. Distinctly marine in some ways and full of interesting bordering on odd flavors. Personally I do find the flavor makeup appealingly strange and there is some high bitterness to MY palate here. Not  my cup of tea but it is well worth a look and consideration.Score Thanks for reading! Whisky Network review ,Scotch,dc220cv,4,t5_2qq65

They create some good highquality malt but then they neuter it by delivering at low proofs chillfiltered.Every caskstrength delivery of Glenfiddich Ive had has been amazingly rich and tasty with a great sense of depth. At the very least they should go back to their s amp s bottling strength of  for everything but ideally  NCF should be the minimum. I get that they make more money and its more massmarket friendly at    but I think everyone would like it more at  and NCF.

10578544,0,t3_5rdnnw,My totally nonexpert opinion is that  drams nightly will not cause major health problems. It is slightly more than doctors recommend but since whisky is fairly slow on the uptake and leaves your body slowly you arent getting the shock to the system that beer drinking or binge drinking result in. If you skip a few days a week then you are right around the healthy habit mark. My biggest issue with whisky drinking is that it comes on so slowly and gently I just get a calm relaxing feeling that never ventured into drunkenness. When I was exploring the range a normal night would be three drams but a more social night could result in  with no ill effects and no hangover. But then because my body was so used to the baseline presence of alcohol taking more than a few days off would result in fairly severe anxiety. It was not fun. I have since changed my habits fairly dramatically. At least  no alcohol nights per week vigorous exercise regimen which generally makes me less inclined to drink alcohol healthy diet....when I have whisky its generally  drams. Its more rewarding overall because I can taste and smell better and everything about the experience is more heightened after a short period of abstinence. ,Scotch,dd73exi,-1,t5_2qq65

10648127,0,t3_5sds2p,Thanks to uwhiskylads for this sample.Got these samples from a guy who isnt active on here anymore. Tried hunting him down. Dog the Bounty Hunter I am not.So Ive decided I am going to review these with the names they have on them. If thats ever proved wrong cool. Ill change these up.So next we have another old one Caperdonich  Duncan Taylor Rare Auld. Caperdonich has been mothballed fairly recently in whisky years in . Its owned by Pernod Ricard and we dont know if its every coming back.Granted weve been there before. This distillery started as Glen Grant . Glen Grant used it to keep up with demand... and then was closed down  years later. Because of a credit crisis.The more things change ladies and gentleman the more they stay the same.In  the distillery was reopened and rebuilt by Glenlivet and given its current name. It gained some upgrades and could be run by  people. In  some Canucks showed up and bought it and they kept it until  when Pernod Ricard ended up with it. Then closed it. So far of the three they closed at the same time Caperdonich is still closed.Granted it took  decades to reopen it. The bottlings pop up and can be quite random which includes a peated malt made in .This is not that malt.The Rare Auld bottling series is no longer on Duncan Taylors website. Im going to assume this means its all fake and Ive found a way out of the matrix.Or rather they no longer make this specific bottling series. Either is possible.So lets see how this tastes shall we?Price NA in OntarioRegion SpeysideVintage .Bottled .Cask Type Oak CaskCask Number Number of bottles Abv .Colour .Y Nose Sprite pine on fire pastry turnip butterLight simple nose on this one which is a surprise. It has this distinctive smell of fire lemon and earthy.Good amount of butter. Its okay but I want more.Taste Caramel mineral green melon lime zest cola ribs that have been cooked in colaHey look its me your friend more.Lots of caramel notes on this one. Fruity good amount of acid more acid and a bunch of caramel.Meaty at one point. If I was having this blind Id guess Mortlach because Im bad at mystery drams.Finish Butterscotch cinnamon buns coffee white chocolate passion fruit raspberryAnd this is why we drink this. The finish is the best part. Its sweet earthy buttery more butter I love butter oh god I have to stop eating so much butter.Also some fruit. Tart aspects to bring it all together.Conclusion Its hard to rate this one because honestly its really quite all over the place. The nose really never opens up. Its unique but... just that. And then the taste is a caramel bomb which is great.Then the finish shows you that its actually an old ass malt and deserves your fucking respect dammit.As such some might find my score odd. If this had the nose like the finish my score would be a lot higher. Or if the taste was just a little more insane I may have increased it.As it stands though I feel that this is the kind of dram you enjoy for the finish. And somewhat the taste.

The question is since your example was bottled has it changed possibly for the better? Im guessing not but itd be interesting to know.The most recent example of a Dalmore expression Ive had was that Cigar Malt thingie. It wasnt bad but it sure was silly and contrived holy smokes it was colored like it was nothing but  year old firstfill hogshead just silly dark. It also had a blend quality almost like a malt blend as it seemed like there were competing malt profiles. I dont know how much the stuff costs wasnt my bottle but it tasted like  dollar whisky but Im guessing from the fancy presentation that its probably well north of a cnote.,Scotch,ddndap4,1,t5_2qq65

If you havent already please review the collection of guides in the sidebar that weve created to address the constant stream of recommendation posts we get here. Specifically Scotchit Gift Guide Recommendations for Beginners Next Level Malt Recommendations Whisky Review Archive Malt MapThe malt map can be an especially valuable reference for exploring different flavor zones or for identifying scotches similar to a particular bottle you have in mind.ampnbspIf youve still got questions after reading the guides please try to be as specific and detailed as possible with your request in order to get the most personalized and relevant responses. Tell us which bottles you or your giftee have liked  Tell us which bottles youre considering now Tell us where you live because pricing and availability can vary dramatically by region.  Let us know if your shop has a limited selection of whiskies so we dont recommend something that you might have a lot of trouble finding Provide a price range that youre comfortable spending on a bottle.ampnbspA Few More General Tips    As far as exploring new scotches we generally advise novices to sample as much as possible by going to a bar splitting bottles with friends attending festivalstastings or getting minis to ensure you buy bottles you enjoy. Most people need to try  scotches to understand their preferences and tastes. It may make more sense for you to buy smaller portions of different whiskies rather than full bottles.Youre going to get the most flavoraroma drinking it neat in a tulipshaped glass like a Glencairn but most new drinkers prefer to water down their whisky a bit. If you do end up adding water Id recommend adding just enough to make it tolerable and take small sips. But really theres no right or wrong way to drink so as long as youre enjoying it youre doing it right.Searching rscotch may yield some additional insights as well.

10877223,0,t1_de0o5ux,Yeah its over. But then again GlenDronach which was the heart of Benriachs meteoric rise always smelled a bit like a bait and switch program. Here was a distillery with a ton of fantastic premothball juice aging. They took that great older product instituted a good wood management program and proceeded to build their reputation on this older product.Yes Billy Walker did a great job making use of what they had but the truth is that their core lineup was built on the back of old juice with specious age statements and incredibly good Single Cask releases which resulted in a rabid following of which I count myself a member. But it was never sustainable and frankly the newer postmothball GlenDro juice is good but its not even remotely comparable to the older  and earlier stuff. I suspect well be talking about the last bottlings of the  the  etc. even the mid  and earlier  along with prerestart SCs with much the same reverence as mid to late s Macallan.

More spicy and acidic now.  Cinnamon and candied ginger. Finish A big robust finish.  Not for the faint of heart.  Not a wide variety of flavors but very big in their intensity.  Oak tannins.  Robust lemon.  Some slight salt with a nice alcohol note pushing the flavors to your palate with very little subtlety.I found this to be similar to the  year official bottling.  It shares many of the same flavors and aromas but is not as well rounded and complex but still quite nice.  The arrival is very nice and the finish packs a good punch.  Another enjoyable Arran.,Scotch,de2reen,3,t5_2qq65

10991960,0,t3_5wyvu5,Background To be upfront this bottle was a challenge. I just started taking scotch seriously a few months ago and had progressed along the standard track from Glenlivet  liked to Glenmorangie  really liked to Balvenie Doublewood loved and to Highland Park  loved. I really wanted to try an Islay after the HP and chose the Laphroaig over the Ardbeg . I was really excited and really wanted to enjoy this since I knew I was stepping my game up and playing in the big leagues. However one sip in and my dreams were crushed. Its peatysmoke potency was way beyond my wildest expectations. I had a hard time choking it down. It wasnt that I hated the taste it was just too overpowering. Needless to say I did not view this dram too highly the first go around. However I was determined to stick it through and treat the bottle just like any other bottle I owned and I kept the Laphroaig in the rotation. Over time I really started to enjoy the unique flavors compared to my other bottles and I can now say I am a fan.Cost  at Total Wine Color copper Nose There is a lot going on here. I feel like I could count endless aromas. charcoal gasoline smoke wood nuts lemon salt seaweed honey Taste wood shop paint thinner salt water oak spices cream and vanilla Finish smoke and rubber that stays with you for long time and I mean hours later I still can feel the taste on my tongue. Conclusion My dedication paid off and after about half my bottle gone I finally started to really enjoy the vast complexity.  There are so many flavors I can identify it is just hard to drink since many of the aromas and flavors are not something humans associate with something that is consumable rubber paint thinner band aids etc..  Rating after first dram  after second dram  halfway through the bottle    Would I buy another bottle Yes Would I order it at a bar Yes Beer I would compare it to I had a hard time coming up with a cross comparison. I have to say it reminds me of a seasonal winter micro brew. Something with a lot of exotic spices and flavors that come together but not something you can drink in mass quantities.,Scotch,dedwjq3,7,t5_2qq65

11311893,0,t1_dfe56b3,That Mortlach Rare Old is the biggest ripoff on the market today. Luckily when I bought it it was at the introductory bargain price of us. Tried a couple of drams in different ways to see if it got better but no. It served a purpose though  brought out the fancy bottle for guests who are impressed by thick glass and fat corks. Poured them as much as they wanted while I sipped Ardbeg  and saying that Ardbeg might be too smoky for you but this is really smooth while making sure they got a good gander at the fancy container that says Rare Old on it. I celebrated by smashing the empty at the town dump. That experience completely turned me off on Mortlach since it was my first pass until last year when someone on this sub provided a sample of a yo Society that was amazing. TLDR  dont waste your time on the Old Rare. And if you did do not let it be your basis of judging their juice. ,Scotch,dfe6ou3,3,t5_2qq65

11375146,0,t3_62bxk4,Now for my second IB attempt at finding a Comus replica.  This was bottled by Rest amp Be Thankful.  Distilled in  and aged in a Sauternes cask for  years.  Bottled at cask strength . ABV.  Nonchill filtered and Natural color.ampnbspNose  Lemons and ginger.  A more refined and sweet peat.  Vanilla butter cream frosting.  Sea salt.Palate  Thick and rich incredibly rich.  Oily and creamy at the same time.  Lemon meringue pie.  Some raspberries and strawberries.  Earthy peat as well.  Sauted shiitake mushrooms.  Honey ham.  Iodine.  Lactic funk.  Honey.Finish  Long long finish.  Caramel flan.  Creme brle.  Sweet sweet smoke.  Lots of smoke.  Some earthy hay and mushrooms lurks under the surface.  And strangely enough after awhile the sweet caramel honey notes come back out and overpower the smoke.Score ampnbspYes.  Fuck yes.  Now this is on the same level as Comus.  I wish I had them side by side to compare.  I also wish I had two girls at the same time.  But you cant always get what you want...  Anyway this is just incredible.  So much going on.

The former has some sherry matured ardbeg thrown in and the latter virgin French oak matured ardbeg. The Oogie is generally sweeter and fruitier while the Corry is dry spicey and a little woodier.

Right now single malts are sexy and blends are B O R I N G so there is some good value shopping to be done in the boring section if you know what you like.The problem is so far as I can tell getting good value out of the blends actually requires a more advanced level of knowledge and palate training than just sticking to the single malts.,Scotch,dgjqsss,2,t5_2qq65
