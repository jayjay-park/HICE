1057235,0,t1_chog72u,I was thinking maybe when a support team plays a jungle team for the duo lane to clear wolves  golems to deny a full clear from the enemy jungler on our side thus preventing the chance of him getting ahead. This then gives the duo lane a slight advantage over their lane as well.Any other thoughts is appreciated.,LoLTwistedTreeline,chognd2,1,t5_2y1f3

I believe one of the hardest skills in this game is shot calling and this post really opened my mind to why my shot calling and play making is so balls. this post is pure gold and there needs to be more of it.

4310993,0,t3_3acz6n,I personally really like machete and a flask. It gives you an incredible amount of sustain letting you leave jungle at full health at lvl so that you can gank of invade.

4724342,0,t1_ctq19oj,Not realy insane as  of challenger teams have one composition that play and if you ban them one champion they are more likely to do shit. We litteraly can see who are we playing against by looking at enemy bans as every team that plays one composition will banout champs that can counter them. Also most of challenger teams dont play at their main team and are more likely to smurf in that elo so you will play against them more often than you should.,LoLTwistedTreeline,ctq1k9w,1,t5_2y1f3

6894829,0,t3_4a4by7,Against Darius adc top is fine he should be easy to kite. Maybe get kalista the slows wont affect her passive ezreal is fine if you know how to get him going. Vayne lucian or any adc should never be touched by darius.Same goes for Olaf but requires a bit more finnese to kite him. Also its a nightmare for Olaf to fall behind especially because he falls off in the lategame so maybe camp him.For Graves I like Pantheon maybe some Lissandra just easy point and click stuns to chain him up and make the game a v. Against duo tops my advice is to look for when you can force or setup a v. Duo top comps mostly rely on getting ahead in the early game then staying ahead all game.I assume you dont ban these  champs because you have more priority bans. ,LoLTwistedTreeline,d0xuidc,1,t5_2y1f3
