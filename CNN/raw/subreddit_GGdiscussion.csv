5222132,0,t3_3mixj9,gtDo you think demonized groups such as GamerGate and MRAs would receive good PR if they tone policed more?This is an interesting question. Do I think GamerGate would get better coverage from major news organizations for this? Nah not really. Just not enough connections and Damsels in Distress is quite a potent narrative. That said I feel like one of the major problems with GamerGate and possibly MRAs although Im not nearly as familiar with them is that people can be almost... aggressively possessively uncivil at times. The idea that Oh this is just changamer culture we say what we want and never tone police.  Which I mean okay I understand that argument but at the same time... it doesnt play well with neutrals. And my personal opinion is that the best tactic in this sort of situation is to try to convince neutrals by being civil and reasoned. That sort of politeness in my opinion would go over a lot better with unaffiliated third parties.Maybe this amounts to tone policing. I dunno.

5238928,0,t1_cvhbne2,gt This is a complex question. Im not willing to say that it happened this simply but Im also not willing to just brush it off like aGGs do. If you look into it youll agree that its the right approach. In my opinion GGs are about  split between agreeing with my sentiment and agreeing with that statement outright. I think youll have a difficult time finding aGGs who will agree that its not something you can just say no that didnt happen about.As have said elsewhere if its a complex question and theres no proof and even if it did happen the advantage obtained for these unproven sexual favours which even Gjoni said didnt happen was five lines of weakly positive mention for a game she was giving away for free that all adds up to something which isnt worth starting a movement over.As a kind of abstract epistemological puzzle Im happy to agree that its possible but extremely poorly supported that in one way or another some kind of chemistry between Grayson and Quinn in some way influenced that brief and weakly positive coverage. The question is who cares? This isnt highlevel corruption with millions at stake its the tenuous speculation that just maybe someone got a tiny amount of free publicity for a free game. There has to be something more going on if hundreds or thousands of gamergaters were so outraged about this they thought it deserved crowdsourced action.gt Journalists colluded to attack gamers!Same again. Its another motteandbailey argument where the exciting version is put about until the truth police arrive and then the boring version is used as a shield until the heat is off. But who cares? Im a gamer if anyone is and Im completely indifferent as to whether a handful of web sites posted an article about demographic change in the gamebuying community.It seems to me that these are either outright lies or deliberately misleading claims which are as deceptive as outright lies and hence equally deserving of condemnation. Moreover the truth which is easily accessible does not even begin to justify the existence of gamergate.This is why the alternative hypothesis that gamergate is fundamentally about misogyny and entitlement rather than ethics seems well supported to me. Theres just no reason to care about the claimed motivations of gamergate. Theyre utterly trivial. So the real motivation must be something else and its a heck of a coincidence that the main targets of gamergate attention are feminist women who criticise or participate in gaming culture.,GGdiscussion,cvhhbl1,5,t5_3a3as

If theyre not the same which one do you believe to be more important and why?I personally mean equality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity puts all people on a level playing field and then allows them to make their choice as free agents. Their choice and the responsibility for that choice always lies on their own shoulders. There are many problems with equality of outcome. For a start equality of outcome relies on active discrimination for superficial results. The state directly interferes in the freedom of an individual  preventing them from making meaningful choices  purely to fulfill an arbitrary quota of XYZ people in a position. On a more practical level it means people get employed and promoted not based on merit but based on who they are. Not only are they then unjustly in the position that they have not earned the government has actively discriminated against better candidates to get a lesser candidate into the role. As a liberal I simply cant stand equality of outcome its the antithesis of actual equality  which is based on personal autonomy and ensuring the states power is limited over the individual. Giving the state power to actively discriminate against the individual based on arbitrary factors is by very definition inequality. ,GGdiscussion,cvkx59j,5,t5_3a3as

And see if like.. while in criticizing Homer and Moe for having homophobic views shaming Bart for liking a toy and enjoying the friendship of a gay man did it feel like the writers were criticizing all of men or the concept of men?This is a red herring. Go look at the way the term toxic masculinity is used. It is consistently used to say this man behaved this way because this is the way men encourage each other to behave  which is just a different way of saying simply this is the way men behave. Toxic masculinity assumes that men encourage each other behave negatively because thats just how men are. It is framed as encouragement to behavior rather than behavior itself because it puts a cognitive layer between feminist theory and the admonishment of men simply for maleness.The only way toxic masculinity can be framed as a result of patriarchal culture rather than maleness in and of itself is if you argue that women would exhibit identical behavior in a mirror matriarchal culture. They dont ever make that argument though. They will usually admit that there would in fact be problems just not the same ones. Thus toxic masculinity roots in patriarchy but patriarchy causes the effects it does because of the nature of maleness. So toxic masculinity is a criticism of males that looks like its a criticism of a single male.tldr Toxic masculinity is used to criticize the behavior of single men not all men  but using a framework that men in general are toxic which is why this single man behaves this way. Its a way to criticize men in gerneral without seeming as if youre criticizing men in general.,GGdiscussion,cvmvn6s,2,t5_3a3as

Then they were basically abused. Cut of from contact. Monitored when contact was made. Punished by shoveling cow shit in the freezing cold. If they tried to run their wasis a dude with a helicopter. Have a church member be a police officer. One person accused them of murder. I think it is actually better now but under no kind of law. Religious boarding schools are exempt from regulation. And almost solely because of this place. Also a couple kids were raped by an employee. Because of course if you are a member of the church you wouldnt do that. No need for back ground check. Warning a total SJW source but if you want to make a difference this is a good place The legislature only meets every two years.

In any case what does that have to do with the modern st world? You argued that these sorts of differences seem to be applied societywide I was countering with an example where it was not though it was admittedly a crude and blunt way in which it was done.Our society is evolved from those societies. Why as individuals swimming in it is it implausible to think that there are therefore tons of socialization signals built into the world we live in? Were conditioned to barely notice them and it takes effort to see where they are. And among these I dont include just the genderbased ones theres classbased ones theres beautybased ones and much more.gt Dont tell it to me tell it to the researcher in the video who was giving a presentation based on her research.If I knew the researcher I would. gt much of that mixing is due to absurd analysis fueled by Gender StudiesIm not referencing any of that stuff  its not an area in which I claim any expertise at all. Im sticking to plain old cog sci neuroscience and psychology stuff.gt I think what much of the social scientists thanks to their refusal to look at biological aspects are drastically misattributing results and its ruining their models.Quite familiar with Wests work. Ive been digging into those patterns since around  cf You should look into complexity science. I recommend Yaneer BarYams work especially gt I think your ethical system is utopian though. I have long disagreed with you on how empathetic your outlook is  Two quotes one from a year ago where an antiGGer was telling another antiGGer why I was talking to GGgt Ive been following Raph for years and if there is anything that defines him its his faith that theres always common ground.gt Id say he takes its stupid to try to reason with them as a dare but that implies way too much malice. He takes its stupid to try to reason with them as an honest mistake but he understands why you made it.To quote Haidt back at yougt Step out of the moral matrix just try to see it as a struggle playing out in which everybody does think theyre right and everybody at least has some reasons  even if you disagree with them  everybody has some reasons for what theyre doing. Step out. And if you do that thats the essential move to cultivate moral humility to get yourself out of this selfrighteousness which is the normal human condition.Thats basically been the MO I have tried to stick to in this whole thing. That to me is what empathy is and does. The fight is in many ways about a largescale failure of empathy between the two sides.I grew up outside of the country living in fourorfive different cultures before the age of . I perpetually feel like I live outside the moral matrix to be honest. I am not utopian about this. There are times when potential cant be achieved but gosh if we cant fix some of this stuff in one of the richest societies on earth cmon...!. I also happen to believe that subnetworks clashing within the larger scale graph of humanity is how society thinks and that means that groups live and die ideas ideals and ideologies are simply wiped away sometimes as groups snap into phase transitions and all align and storm off in one direction. That much of the time what we think of as independent thought isnt. That the way all networks function is that subgroups mature into specialist subsystems and that often does subsume individuality and turn members of said group into cogs in a machine. I also think of those who can step out as sort of like the white blood cells of the system racing off to deal with inflammation. One can be a humanist and also well frankly have a really damn mechanistic and fatalistic view of the largerscale processes. But you know what? We can still make it better here and now why not?

No way.

He was literally answering the question in the OP. He was asked if he thought there was a backlash and explained why. Punishing people for their opinions and rationale when directly asked what they think is a really shitty thing to do.Ill wait a while for a response or until much later today whichever comes first before acting there. Overturned the second as per swingshifts second opinion.from swingshiftM via rGGdiscussion to TeuthexM sent  day agoIts not the opinion I object to. The opinion is fine though I disagree. Its the tone. Ive modded others from both sides for less. Change the tone to be more polite and less snarky and Id overturn right away.from TeuthexM via rGGdiscussion to swingshiftM sent  day agoIm not seeing it but this is what third opinions are for.to TeuthexM via rGGdiscussion sent  hours agoIm in agreeance with swingshift on this one.

5399107,0,t3_3oybew,gt What do you think about the merits of this theory the arguments for and against it?I think its a waste of time. If somebody is spending all day watching TV and doesnt go outside enough to know the difference between reality and TV they cant possibly cause harm either way as theyre only ever in the private sphere. If somebody who is a heavy tv watcher then goes outside they will have the notions presented to them on the TV challenged assuming the TV is inaccurate and realize the flaws in the TV. This theory also relies on a pretty insulting notion  that people who watch TV are so incredibly stupid that they couldnt tell the difference between reality and media. Frankly Ive yet to meet a single person who couldnt tell the difference  stupid or not. gt  In what ways has video games or other media influenced or shaped the way you thought or reinforced previously unexamined prejudices or biases?None consciously beyond making me interested in certain things leading to me actually studying them to find out more. Id never know if it had affected me unconsciously but if it has it certainly isnt noticable. I.E my political views were formed from engaging with political philosophy not a TV. gt Do you consider yourself insusceptible to sexist ideas in video games?Yes because I can tell the difference between reality and a video game. Youd have to be beyond unintelligent to not understand the difference. Also yes because there is no notable sexism in videogames to begin with. gt Do you think there is even sexism in games culture to begin with?Entirely different question flipping from media which is what is relevant to cultivation theory to a culture. However as I dont think people generally are sexist  and there is nothing notably sexist about videogames on the whole  it stands to reason that videogame culture is also not sexist. ,GGdiscussion,cw1sn6y,3,t5_3a3as

5474179,0,t1_cwasyc4,Clarence Thomas seems to care why racists denigrate the accomplishments of black people.  His opposition to AA in informed in part by that very thing.And of course I agree that success should ideally depend solely on merit.  But it doesnt.  And AA is an attempt to push down on a scale thats already skewed.I have to question the notion that its bad for a person to succeed by leveraging their privilege though.  If a person could reject such an advantage it wouldnt be privilege.  In an ideal world being named Rockefeller wouldnt be an advantage over being named Somed or whatever but short of drastic action that Rockefeller cant turn their advantage off.  Im not going to say theyre in the wrong for enjoying what the world gives them.  I just want the world to give a few things to other people as well.  In other words systemic problems have systemic solutions.  I know its an article of faith among antiSJW types that the concept of privilege is nothing more than an excuse to attack white people but neither I nor any feminist I respect uses it that way.Heres a video game example of what I mean Richard Garriott a.k.a. Lord British creator of the Ultima series had an extremely privileged upbringing.  His family was wealthy if not toptier filthy rich and well educated and his school had access to computers at a time when this was rare.  Without either of these unearned advantages Garriott never would have been able to create Akalabeth as a teenager and thus would never have created Ultima.  Am I really supposed to think less of his incredible accomplishments because of this?  I think thats an absurd notion.  But at the same time it sure would have been nice if some poor innercity kids could have had a nice computer to play with back then as well.  Maybe one of them could have created an even better game.  But they never had that chance.  Thats the tragedy here not that a white boy made good.,GGdiscussion,cwbdlvb,1,t5_3a3as

5529065,0,t1_cwi66om,gt I think elaborating towards those questions could get pretty complex. I used to think that I was egalitarian because I was arrogant privileged and didnt really have more than a passing understanding of either egalitarianism or feminism. I thought feminism was basically the feminazis that film and television had shown me and didnt really come across anything different.May I ask how you view yourself as privileged? I just ask because the feminist view of privilege I see is a very biased outlook on the world that pretty much does not acknowledge any form of female privilege and if they do its benevolent sexism reinforcing what I see as a silly notion of women being oppressed and men being oppressors.gtand even moreso allowed for flexibility which is a big part of why I can identify as such and not worry when other feminists disagree because that just.. is the nature of it.And thats a reason I dislike it. Not everything you believe with has to fall in line with an ideology so trying to do such a thing creates this monstrous mess of things that are only tangential related through the thinnest of strings. You have feminism being sex negative and sex positive trans exclusive and inclusive say feminism is equality for everyone and feminism is bringing women up to men. Its all a bunch of conflicting BS that makes it hard for feminism to mean anything to me outside of a very biased view of society that it hurts women to a greater extent then men and when you call people out they say thats not feminism and absolve themselves of any relation.gtEgalitarianism honestly there wasnt a lot out there about it when I was looking into things. I find that its usually a pretty passive ideal and much of the creed that it advocates can already be found in bits and pieces of feminism anyway.The thing I see about egalitarianism is that it really is just an ideology not activism. Its about the base treatment of people and if you are trying to treat everyone fair you are falling in line with it. The thing is for every bit and piece you find similar in feminism you can also find ones that do not align with the concept of treating everyone equally due to the inherent bias involved in feminism.gtFeminist views on social power structures is probably what drew me in the most. So patriarchy theory? I find it to be an incredibly biased outlook on the past using values of todays society to judge decisions of past societies ignoring the context of those decisions and applying an extremely biased and inflammatory intent. I mean feminist will go on and on about how women arent top CEOs no parity in ELECTED POSITIONS or theres a wage gap that they continually misrepresent etc. to show women being disadvantaged to men yet will then ignore all the men that arent CEOs who are the majority of homeless people and victims of violent crimes the men that are below them.gtIve always been an urban lefty who was interested in social and political issues. Some might consider me a socialist to an extent  but I felt like when I did look into egalitarianism it was a little too marxist for me applying equality to everything even in cases where I didnt think we needed it because I have no problem with a socialistleaning capitalist democracy. Every political system has its place and Im not big on absolutes in that regard.Are you saying some people should not be equal then? Because thats what Im taking from this? And while thats fine I would like to know how youre applying this to people who are the people who should not equality applied to them?Also I feel like youre confusing feminism and egalitarianism here. Time and time again I see feminism fighting for full parity when men are above women. Equal amount of members in political offices equal amounts of CEO equal amounts of pay despite different amount of work equal amount of women in STEM etc. These are all situations where not having equality is fine for me but definitely not for feminism and cases where I feel there should be equality aka boys falling behind in education feminism shut their damn mouths Egalitarianism seems much more inline with equality in opportunity then feminisms equality of outcome that you say you dont align with so why do you align with it?And maybe youll say thats not my feminism but its what everyone else sees. You call yourself a feminist theyll apply their understanding of it onto you thats how association works.,GGdiscussion,cwidxm9,5,t5_3a3as

If you remember I wasnt online then and didnt see that conversation until afterthefact which I apologized for. Which was also the basis for me saying should revoke both AGG and Hokes. Although in this case your recommendation to discuss the rule came after Hokes had broken R not before. gt The AGG and hokes thing happened because we did not deal correctly with mod consensus or mod objections.Correct. The AGG thing specifically is what led to my proposal. gt The old standards were not standardsWere they applied consistently? Yes when I was a mod. They were standards then. gt This line of argument doesnt really work considering we flipped flop on some things while you were a mod at your expressed consent.Flipflopping was specifically relating to retroactive application. If you recall I strongly opposed any and all retroactive application of new rules even when I didnt like the rule. I have no issue with reform I pushed for plenty myself. I absolutely have an issue with retroactive application of new rules to old violations. That isnt fair period. gt It should have beenI agree but it wasnt. gt We never applied the  day ban to anyone elseIt was already established though. Thats the thing. Youd publicly stated it. Others had acknowledged it in slack. It was the standard. You didnt question it until after the rule was broken not before. If you had questioned Rs application and severity and changed it before Hokes broke the rule twice I wouldnt have any issues. gt That is why hokes is still banned the only change is to the length of that ban. If we had applied the  day ban to another user based on R and were reversing it just on hokes you would have a very valid point I would agree with but that is not the case.This is the problem though. The scale was already established publicly. Youve changed it due to Hokes. That isnt appropriate. There are many complicated factors in moderating Hokes that arent there when moderating a normal user which shouldnt be the case. The leak Their modmails and the AGG deal come to mind immediately. It isnt that I dont understand why youve changed it Im contesting the change because youve done it for a user as a special concession that youre now going to apply. You shouldnt be changing entire rules linking to subreddits etc for one user. This wouldnt have happened with any other user. It literally doesnt matter if you hadnt already banned someone for  days.

Yes its shit that people get on there to rant complain or even bitch at you for their frustration at a game but that is what block features are for Ive used them too amp in one or two cases HAD to use them. Well that is where we can both agree or disagree on Ellie she is just a great character over all that she can mean something different to everybody you see her a certain way amp so do I. Shoehorned in sexuality is not opposed? what do you think the GG argument got dragged into. A bunch of people complained that characters in games they dont like are oversexualized amp the others are perceived to be sexualized. Take for an example Maria in Silent Hill . She can be considered a very sexualized character in the way she carries herself amp the way she is dressed. Is that demeaning her? I dont think so but some people will amp they want that gone. Even though there was purpose to her being the way she was in that game. Nobody supports GG. The issue here is it was never about gaining support from the media because the issues raised concerned the media. Looking for support is to stop the media attacking the gaming community as a whole whether you a agree with that or not. Youve seen Fox news amp other right wing outlets support antivaxxers. The thing is only certain people in those outlets support gamers in this arguments amp that is the difference between outlets amp individuals. Fox News cant be bothered with Gamers amp the Left Wing Media which I was a follower of dont see it as important enough to report on the facts of BOTH sides. Gamers as you know are mainly apathetic but they dont like the gaming media at all most dont give a fuck one way or another. Its just gamers who wanted more transparency amp got shit on for it.

They have a structure they have leaders and that structure those leaders tell us they stand for working families but despite this fabulous structure and leaders telling us that is the case is that how you see the Republican party? Or do you consider them to push legislation that more often than not enriches the wealthier denizens of the country and reduces welfare and economic support to the poorer inhabitants of the country. They certainly dont explicitly state that they are the rich mans party do they?So how has it come to be that they are generally perceived  even to one outside the country such as I  to be a group more inclined to give tax breaks and the like to the rich than the Democratic party if their leadership and structure isnt telling us thats the case? Oh thats right we judge them based on their actions we look at the historical record what laws theyve supported what laws theyve blocked and what is the outcome the end result of that legislation. Its actually a pretty common technique you probably use it in all areas of your life  you might have a sibling that is undependable and will borrow money and never pay it back i do anyway and he doesnt tell me he wont end up reimbursing me but Ive experienced him not doing so in the past. All you need to do is take the same principle that you use in all other aspects of your life and apply it to a group known as Gamergate.prediction of the same tired argument  we cant know what is or isnt gamergate because I lack the ability to distinguish between a petition with  signatures from people all identifying as GamerGate talking about ethics in games journalism amidst a years worth of other GamerGate campaigns relating to ethics in the games industry and this one guy who called Anita an ltexpletivegt providing an example would have me sitting in modmail for  hours due to the moderation practices of this subreddit and used the GamerGate hashtag once a year ago.gtPopularity is not a metric for anything but proving some people in GG care about somethingHere youre almost right popularity is a metric we can use to make several conclusions but in this case one of them  that it proves people care about the popular thing  is all we need to put to rest this silly argument.Gamergate isnt one person so one person calling someone an ltexpletive again because an example would have this comment moderated due to the moderation practices of this sub although come to think of it Ive alluded to an expletive before and had that comment banned so even this precaution may not be enoughgt isnt reflective of GamerGate. However if something is popular say if  people identifying as gamergate are strongly in favor of something or conversely against something then you can attribute it to Gamergate.Its actually remarkably easy to figure out if there isnt consensus or if Gamergate does not stand for something  they will say so. As before when I mentioned someone using the Harper dox to contact her supporters Gamergate not only didnt support that action but strongly rejected it  and the number of people passionately saying so on KiA twitter and other mediums is how you know. Its not a secret its a fairly vocal group.Fair warning Im done discussing the topic of whether we can know anything about what GG is or stands for due to it being a leaderless group with no joining barriers.

It would hardly be surprising to see a k upvoted conservative post andor a k upvoted liberal one on the same day. Its also important to note that KiAs enemy  progressives  basically launch off from the fundamental flaws of liberalism. Namely the harm principle but expanded abusing social tyranny as liberals have few answers to it private property being able to nullify free speechexpression due to how public vs private spheres work in liberal philosophy etc. Its not really too surprising that even liberals have alot of issues with flaws of liberalism I say this as a Mill liberal given that progressives are the political group that consistently abuses the flaws and loopholes in liberalism to their own ends. All the while smirking and claiming theyre trying to protect minorities from a perceived tyranny of the majority and are totally  liberals. With all that said liberalism allows for people to be critical of it and still liberal critique is actually a key value of liberalism in the first place. People can be both critical of aspects of liberalism that are realised negatively and a liberal in their own right. There is no real reason why any liberal would accept the label of rightwinger when they are socially andor economically liberal and follow liberal philosophy. To answer the last bit Im not a GG supporter but Im absolutely a Mill liberal. More importantly the current crop of progressives are absolutely not liberals by and large they knowingly or otherwise abuse loopholes in liberalism to minimize liberty and autonomy collectivize people rather than allow individualism dont have any respect for political liberty bar there own nor indeed any freedom of expression or speech bar their own.

7101859,1,t1_d1lcmal,gt Sex is bad desire is badOkay you fundamentally dont get her points nor her assumptions. At all. Sex and desire isnt bad  its the normalization of reducing women to objects of sexual desire by presumed straight male players thats bad. Theres plenty of pornsex games and many of them can be feminist too. The key issue is agency  whether the female characters have an inner life have desires that grow organically from a wellrounded threedimensional character not token attributes to flimsily justify walking around in bikinis for the presumed straight male players gaze. Like Quiet. Literally no reason to be almost naked and the plot contrivance to legitimize it is hilariously dumb.Now Miranda gets a lot of flak in the ME series and the suits for women are always far more on the skimpy side than they are for men but the series still treats its female characters better than its peers  the women have agency and an inner life. They choose to romancehave sex with the protagonist out of real organic motivations. They can have deep romance or oneoff flings and flirtation because they are realistic threedimensional women. That kind of sexdesire is good.gt  I mean even if I WERE a person who agreed with her basic beliefs I would think TVW had just outstayed its welcome by now she just hammers the same basic logic again and again and video after video she brings nothing new to the table except and this only slightly different aspect of something to do with women being sexy is also bad for the same reasons and never really breaks new ground.Seriously?

7164654,0,t3_4dm87s,. I suppose I like it. I havent played Overwatch and thus I dont really have an opinion on Tracer but I do think this is a more dynamic and interesting pose to strike compared to the old one. Well done Blizzard.. Not particularly. While its definitely still focusing a little on the butt but Ive never felt that sterilizing everything sexually provocative from a game was a productive position to take. Theres enough people out there that someone will take offence to anything though and Im certain some will feel that this change doesnt go far enough.. I dont think it was any more sexist than any other slightly flirty or provocative pose. What I do think is that it was dull and that perhaps it relied more on a passive sexuality that some of the original complainants felt was inappropriate for the character. If Tracer is indeed filling the role of the punky pixie girl trope then its reasonable to view the old pose as out of place.. I see no reason not to believe them. People have been dissecting the two posts looking for evidence that they were somehow deceiving everyone and had actually caved to the dreaded SJWs losing their backbone. Those people are wasting their time. . Calling this a marketing scheme is giving it far too much credit. I think the initial post was an attempt to appear more accommodating than they may actually have been. I dont think Kaplan anticipated the ridiculousness of the pushback and then had to reveal the reasoning behind their capitulation by responding to the post and reopening the thread. Was it deception? Not really. At the most it was a lie of omission. More likely it was a hastily written post that garnered more criticism than was expected.. I think it was hypocritical and idiotic. There was some reason to be genuinely concerned about the initial post but rather than assume that there was more to the decision than a four line forum post could convey people responded with a massive overreaction. People cancelled preorders because of their disgust with Blizzards hypersensitivity the irony of which seemed to be completely lost on them. Even after the second post which provided a perfectly reasonable explanation for the decision people continued to rage looking for holes in their logic. People simply couldnt accept that perhaps Blizzard doesnt want to design the game as a big fuck you to the SJWs.. I dont think most of them really knew what they wanted to see but rather what they didnt. Like I said before some people cant be satisfied and will find a problem in anything so they wont be changing their tune. Others will be pleased. Generally speaking I think that both sides are going to look at this and claim that they won. When you ask either side however theyll say the other one lost. I suspect that the real winners will be Blizzard.Just to cap this off I want to talk about what irked me about this whole controversy. If the forum post hadnt been made in the first place and Blizzard had simply patched the pose in with no fanfare whatsoever no one would have cared. The outrage wasnt because a pose was changed or that Blizzard had listened to feedback. It was because they displayed sympathy to one group in particular and GGKiA doesnt like that. Edit Misread question . I have no idea how they feel about the new pose and dont care enough to look for myself right now.,GGdiscussion,d1sjwne,3,t5_3a3as

7172698,0,t1_d1t952u,gt Being sexy is alright in itself. If most female characters are sexy thats a problem. If they all follow a narrow ideal thats only eye candy for boys thats a problem.If gaming has too many sexy women widowmaker is adding to that number and should be changed in order to reduce the harm caused by this problem. Even just looking within the game none of the women are super unattractive like some of the men are. Something still needs changing. I thought people just wanted more variety at first but then people kept criticizing individual women in individual games and I havent seen anybody do some sort of analysis of all the women in last years biggest games and figure out how many of them are sexy or sexualized. Not even an analysis of women in just the games one individual chose to play last year. Are we making any progress to having enough notsexy women in games? Has anybody thought about roughly what percentage they would consider enough to make the remaining sexy women nonharmful? Id like to point out that if you look at what Anita said about movie tropes most women in movies do not suffer mystical pregnancies but she still criticized the trope as harmful and requests that writers stop using it.

10767822,0,t3_5twk4w,gtWhat is Gamergate to you? How relevant is journalism to Gamergate now?To me GamerGate is the gaming communitys pushback against corruption censorship and gatekeeping in the industry. In regards to journalism I believe that GamerGate should continue to serve primarily in a watchdog capacity and hold journos feet to the fire when they behave unethically.gtHow did you first find out and why did you take the side youve taken on it? Have you refined your view over the past year and a half?I got involved with GamerGate around February or March  after discovering Internet Aristocrats video series on it. It seemed really fascinating to me and so I signed up for a Twitter account and reached out to people on both sides. The proGamerGate side was almost always super friendly plus willing to explain their position and provide evidence to back up all of their claims. The antiGamerGate side was often very quick to block and generally refused to back up their claims no matter how polite I was.Over time I eventually became more and more sympathetic to GamerGate as I saw how the antiGamerGate side behaved and how badly the proGamerGate side was misrepresented. What really won me over to the proGamerGate side though was seeing how many antiGamerGaters were calling for censorship with things like ChangeTheCover the Pillars of Eternity controversy the Lionhead Studios controversy etc.gtHas Gamergate achieved its goals?Id say that we have largely achieved our goals in regards to exposing and largely putting an end to social justice attempts at gatekeeping the industry. The antiGamerGate and social justice community in gaming has largely lost their influence outside of a handful of game journos. They dont have the ability to get their hashtags off the ground or to call for offensive content to be removed from a game. On top of that game developers largely refused to adopt pretty much all of the crazy stuff that was being proposed.In regards to journalism I think we won some victories but ultimately games journalism remains a hot mess. Im not sure anything can really save a lot of these games journalism sites now not without a lot of the most egregious people losing their jobs. However just like with our opposition to censorship and social justice gatekeeping we should remain vigilant and call out stupidity when we see it.gtHow important is feminism to Gamergate and how do you feel about it?Feminism is definately a part of the GamerGate conversation in particular feminism in the games industry. Personally I feel that feminism has largely lost its way becoming very dogmatic hostile and authoritarian. With that being said I have no issue with anyone who supports actual equality and there are some feminists who are alright. In addition there are plenty of antifeminists who are psychotic and I try to call out stupidity no matter who it is.gtIs discussion of harassment relevant to Gamergate or is it a red herring?Its a red herring especially if the person discussing harassment only focuses on the harassment antiGamerGate people have received. Just a couple days ago a young woman who supports GamerGate was doxed and harassed complete with her being impersonated on social media with the fake accounts giving out her address and saying that she wants to have sex with the men in question. And the fake account impersonating her brings up her support of GamerGate in the pastebin it is spreading around which implies that the doxing was at least partially because she is proGamerGate. Yet where is the media outrage? Where are CNN MSNBC The Huffington Post Polygon Kotaku The Mary Sue and all of these other outlets?The fact of the matter is that there is no proof that the GamerGate community supports harassment. If someone in our community was outed as doxing someone or sending death threats we would condemn them and most likely ban them from most of our communities. Multiple studies prove that very very few people in GamerGate have engaged in harassment. We dont believe in silencing our opponents through the very tactics that theyd use on us we believe in defeating our opponents through the marketplace of ideas.gtFinally what makes an ideal game review? What in your opinion would a game journalist do to win your trust as a source of information? Or is trusting a journalist a bad idea?I dont think I really have an ideal game review. I am largely fine with people reviewing games as they see fit provided they arent being unethical about it. However I would like to see journos move away from using their political views as the benchmark by which to review games. And personally I would prefer journos be less condescending to gamers who have different tastes from them.,GGdiscussion,ddqmdad,7,t5_3a3as

You can use it to frame the conversation around anything you want to talk about.He couldve written a novellength piece about how the games lack of simulated dogshit makes a political statement about Australias public cleaning services because he happened to tread in some earlier that day and that would be just as valid an observation.By not writing about the literally infinite number of other political topics he could potentially write about in relation to Forza Horizon  he has in effect forced his own politics into it.As a blog entry or oped soapbox rant whatever floats your boat I guess. But its using video games as a thin pretext for talking about the unrelated topics hed rather talk about it doesnt have much legitimacy as actual criticism.Personally I think its a bit of a waste of time writing a whole response piece just to basically say get a load of this garbage but the Heatstreat guy was just as entitled to do that as the Vice guy was to publish the original article.gtBut you cant take a look at that published for public consumption response that backloads insults against that writers livelihood and personal politics simply because theyre disagreed with and tell me that the text itself may not be apolitical casually while others are being thrown under the bus simply for having these interpretations.By thrown under the bus you basically mean criticised right?This is exactly what I meant when I was talking about obligation.

11615298,0,t1_dgbxo2f,gt You cant subvert or satirize something by presenting it at face value just as it is. Its like chan satirizing racism by becoming actual racists.Except we see it already in other areas.For example there was this recent journalistic masterpiece When people called them out for allowing this sexist and racist filth on their website here is how they responded But if you go looking for it now its been deleted because whoops it turns out it was a trollSo here we have a case of someone satirizing the viewpoints of the Huffington Post then the HuffPo defending these viewpoints as pretty standard for feminist theory and how there was nothing in the article that should have shocked or surprised anybody before realizing it was satire.,GGdiscussion,dgclrft,3,t5_3a3as

11742681,0,t1_dgr0mau,gtIf anything that reinforces my pointWhat is your point? Im not entirely sure what it is. That these people wont permit discussion? Thats fine but your response was already a bit of a non sequitur in response to my own. I have to wonder what the point is. Its nothing that really relates to my comment. All I said was in response to this guy asking what I was going to do to Atlus I just said Id criticise what they do and you went along and started slagging off the writers of the article in the response.Fair point but not really a relevant one. Happy to talk to you anyway just...confused.gtpeople who demonstrate bad faith who are not amenable to discussion really cant complain when after they have tried to shut every viewpoint except their own out of the conversation others label them as extremists and cease to give them the benefit of the doubt.Bollocks. Everyone has the responsibility to treat arguments based on their own merits. If you want to say I dont like the way you act therefore dont complain when people disregard everything you have to say thats fine but I doubt youd be fine with people treating you with that same standard and it makes the discussion that much poorer.Thats why I brought up that I agreed with these people in their criticisms of Atlus. Usually whenever an article is posted here that has the same bent its utter garbage but I feel like I have a responsibility to be fair and keep an open mind because thats how things move forward. This is a topic that I think is worth thinking about. Its a minor thing and its nothing I would have thought of even as someone of a minority group so Im happy that someone who cares more about it offered up something worth thinking about.And whats this label them as extremists? What does that mean exactly? Treating their arguments as worse than they because of the behavior of a person is bad enough but to then say that they shouldnt complain if others are going to define a person based on that mischaracterization is a bit beyond the pale to be honest.,GGdiscussion,dgr29qu,1,t5_3a3as
11767775,0,t1_dgtrxyo,gt Elizabeth is an example of a female sidekick who is reduced to a tool.I mean you might not agree but thats not inconsistent. Shes a door opener and the source of whats effectively  the players tear power since the player decides what where and when for most of the uses of the tear ability through the game.I think the claims a bit hyperbolic but not terribly far off base or inconsistent with the earlier statements.And I feel shes overlooking the developments of Elizabeth as a character that happen during the games downtime. But in terms of mechanics? Elizabeth is pretty much what Anita described her as.gt She also still doesnt understand what sexualisation means and uses it to describe any and all female characters who are attractive or show a little too much skin or cleavage like Elizabeth.I mean... Elizabeth is sexualized. I dont object to it because I think its tastefully done but her designs clearly meant to sexually titillate.,GGdiscussion,dgtwozq,3,t5_3a3as
