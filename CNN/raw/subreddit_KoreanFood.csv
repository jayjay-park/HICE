9050851,0,t3_53qqof,I love that dipping sauce too!Question for everybody though What type of sesame oil is it? It tastes completely different from the kind I use at home. I buy the pure sesame oil thats darker in color and stronger in flavor. The restaurant type is lighter in color and flavor. ,KoreanFood,d7zro14,1,t5_2s1t9
9219803,0,t3_52ovsi,Some tips on making this dish. Taste the broth of the soy sauce sugar mix at the beginning. If its salty and or sweet at the beginning itll be magnified when youre done. Also factory in the color. If your broth is dark at the beginning your potatoes will be super dark by the end. Anticipate the water evaporating. Restaurants make it way tooooo sweet. They drench it in corn syrup. I personally do not like this and prefer it more savory thank plain sweet. Frying the potato before hand helps with the potatoes not having the dissolved look. ,KoreanFood,d8koegg,1,t5_2s1t9
9638296,0,t3_5d0x9t,I just thought of one for you. I cook a lot of Korean food and gochugaru is mostly just added to stuff in my experiencefor more red brightness color in dishes spice level depending on how spicy to gochugaru is and little flavor. Korean cucumber dish you can tryIngredients youll need  Persian cucumbers  fresh garlic clove sesame oil sugar or any sweetener you like salt gochugaru. Slice thin but not too thin so you keep the crunch the Persian cucumbers round and thin draw out the excess water by putting it in salt for couple minutes rinse and squeeze. Crush fresh garlic. Add should half tablespoon sesame oil and half tablespoon gochugaru. Make sure you dont make it pasty as the gochugaru can make things pasty if too much added. Add salt and sweetener to yoh liking. Sorry this is in such messy format. The flavor profile is good. I usually add this to nengmyun  cold beef broth with buckwheat noodles I know it gets complicated. You can make the cucumber dish just to add gochugaru lol . You can maybe even eat this cucumber dish with rice. Basically if you have sesame oil and garlic in your pantry you can almost make any Korean side dish and add gochugaru to your liking.Dishes heavy with gochugaru ddukboki rice cake with fish cake kimchi jigae kimchi casserole yookaejang spicy beef soup kimchi fried rice anything  thats a red dish! Theres also amd Korean fish cake side dosh that you can add gochugaru too fish cake they call is tempura in japanese or uhmok in korean sliced up to the shape of your liking garlic onion green onion jalapeno sesame oil sweetener soy sauce fry that all up and add gochugaru to make it red. Eat with rice thats one of my fav dishes to eat with just rice. Sorry for the overload I guess I love gochugaru too. Ha,KoreanFood,da14a2k,6,t5_2s1t9
