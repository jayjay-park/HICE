3098927,0,t3_2vm7gq,If its going to be teambased we could just use the team page when assigning flair. The problem with that and any RES tag is that it becomes redundant on this sub where we already have nicer flair.The only solution and not a very good one that Id suggest is moving subreddit flair to the left so that it doesnt interfere with RES tags,LaserTagLeague,coj7apr,3,t5_36kbg
