139502,0,t1_cee4fgm,I use exclusively pipe tobaccos. Most all are easy to roll even flake cutyou just have to break it up a bit. I was a pipe smoker long before I started rolling and I find pipe tobaccos depending on the brand to be cheaper than most other tobacco options.It wont be as cheap as a big old bag of Criss Cross or something like that but the taste experience and ease of rolling is worth the few dollars more.,handrolling,ceubhyl,2,t5_2ut0e
