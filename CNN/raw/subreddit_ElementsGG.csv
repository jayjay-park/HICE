4401770,0,t1_csljn28,Now I have made a rd team!  Since the first team is now ranked Im limitied to  invites to the team pweek.. So that one is locked for furhter players but the  others are not ranked which means that I can kick and add players as I want. Youll stay on the team that you play the most on and get to know those players! ,ElementsGG,csltbbh,1,t5_35sgt

4498333,0,t3_3cp2eh,Finally! Tabzz is playing well and Dexter is always on point! Am i dreaming? Im not saying that they played bad before but they definitely stepped up. I was so scary when Jwaow get caught... But Tabzz with Dexter were there. Very nice game in whole. Just still some miss communication. Jwaow died solo twice. If we beat UOL it will be awesome. Lets do this guys! bELieve,ElementsGG,csxo4s2,1,t5_35sgt
4558036,0,t3_3df7z0,They were suppose to be ready but we faced an unforeseen delay from the vendor due to the playerjerseys being unique in each their colorscheme something that makes printing the jerseys a whole lot more tedious.

4944962,0,t1_cuhsmgf,Thank for the news can you give us a little more about the jersey that will be coming to the store. We know that they wont have any sponsor on it. About the name on the back country and number. How many version of the jersey will be available ?  as expected one for each member from top to support. Or only  with the star player on it Froggen ? Can we expect some jersey with Krepo  Wickd  Shook on the back ? Can we expect the jersey to be custom we could write our name on the back and chose a flag  number ? So many questions as you can see.,ElementsGG,cuhuox6,2,t5_35sgt
