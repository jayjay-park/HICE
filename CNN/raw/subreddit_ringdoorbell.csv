8189705,0,t1_d5101tr,Thanks. Unfortunately I was still in the free trial of the subscription and forgot to pay for it before it expired. As soon as I realized what happened I paid for both the doorbell and the stickup cam I have but by that point the free trial videos had been deleted according to Ring.com customer service. Fortunately I was smart enough to download the video of the delivery from FedEx and the theft two hours later and have them on my phone and up on the Facebook neighborhood pages that I belong to so theyre not lost I just dont know where to put them online so I can anonymously share similar to imgur but with video.,ringdoorbell,d519jc1,1,t5_38crn

8725458,0,t1_d6k4mfn,I was thinking the same thing till I saw nestcam was  dollars a month.  I wanted to switch over to August and nest cams to have just the same ecosystem but there online service is x what ring is.  I wish ring would open up the Api so it would allow me to do local storage if I choosed to but for  bucks a month Im ok with it.  Recently cancelled Netflix so have the cash for it.,ringdoorbell,d6wboog,1,t5_38crn

9383326,0,t3_591rvk,Bought the pro.  Broke  months in.  Called ring and they replaced it. Had the band issue which is now rectified.  Yesterday had to reboot it as it was not timing the inner chime anymore.  Besides that I still like it. its working well.  ,ringdoorbell,d95ei4v,1,t5_38crn

10189214,0,t1_dbyjfqr,My door and Ring face west. I get CONSTANT motion alarms when a car passes by and reflects the sun off its side window. Maybe its the same for you? The sun reflects off the glass of the passing car and whites out the entire sensor on the Ring and triggers an alert. Nobodys fault Im considering tilting it to the right to see if that fixes it.,ringdoorbell,dbz05js,1,t5_38crn
10968556,0,t3_5whlxl,While it CAN be done from the customer support end and it looks like a feature request may be approved from the appside soon? be careful because if you expose for the area closest to a very covered entry area itll whiteout everything farther out and it can also misbalance the view at night vs. daytime.,ringdoorbell,debbup6,1,t5_38crn
