1480457,0,t1_cj1mjzu, year deal doesnt matter because none of its guaranteed. Its essentially the same deal that any UDFA or futures contract player would get. Gives them a shot at coming in and making the team but nothing is guaranteed. Im not as high on Ball as many seemm to be as many like you seem to think he is a lock to make the team. But realistically weve seen nothing from him yet and hes done nothing at the NFL level yet so hes on the same level as any other UDFA or camp body who is going to try and prove themselves in camp and I wouldnt project him right now to make the roster either based on the fact we havent seen him yet.

2314799,0,t3_2lsr6x,As best as I can tell we lose games because the other team scores on their turnovers and we dont get any.  This game and our season would be very different if Brees didnt throw so many interceptions and consistently had time to throw good passes.I also think Paytons playcalling has gotten a little strange.  Why are we running the ball on nd and ?  Why are we frantically running up to the line of scrimmage to spike it instead of calling a timeout and saving all that time?  Why are we calling the offense conservatively when we have the necessity and weapons to be more aggressive and spread the game out?  Dont get me wrong Ingram is awesome but if were down  with time to score before half we cant do little rinkydinky little plays that get us  yards each time especially when Colston and Graham do their best work  yards out.Oh and giving up big plays in the th quarter doesnt help naturally.  My father swears we have the worst defense on rdth and long.  Gotta play all  minutes.Alright.  Im done.  To be honest Im not holding my breath for playoffs.  If we do get in it will be because we hung on to the top of the division somehow.

Prior to that he was the defensive coordinator at Florida and his defense carried us to our only successful season under Muschamp. His second half adjustments that year were simply the best Ive ever seen in football.When it comes to transitioning to the head coaching role all bets are off though. I know hes a great coach there are other guys like that too see Muschamp Rex Ryan Lane Kiffin etc but history has proven that the head coaching role is more of a managerial spot and less of a coaching spot.,Saints,co9543h,2,t5_2s1wf

5245821,0,t3_3muul4,Frankly I imagine your line will have its way with us and then well make Weeden look like the st round pick he was.  The long version our pass rush has been ATROCIOUS.  We get next to no push up the middle and our ends while generating varying amounts of pressure fail to harmonize that rush into anything meaningful i.e. Kikaha gets a good push and Jordan may as well but the QB just steps back and rolls out.  Carson Palmer and Jameis Winston were just rolling out not too differently than Cam Newton did this past week.Our secondary has done a commendable job outside of on Tight ends.. so Witten is going to look  again but the pass rush has just been beyond awful so theyre struggling to provide coverage for upwards of  seconds on some plays.McCown actually played pretty well last week outside of underthrowing Cooks right at the end for an INT.  I expect him to more or less manage the game again.Our WRs sadly are continuing to fail to make plays and even drop wide open passes.  We have no TE play in the passing game.  The backs are trying and by and large are a talented squad but teams are getting to the point of daring us to pass  since the running backs are the only targets of any consequence.  The Oline has been a mixed bag.  The pass protection was good weeks  and  but  it was bad.  The run blocking hasnt been good but I think thats a function of teams beginning to dare us to pass since our nonRB targets struggle to win  on  matchups much less catch the ball even in soft spots in zone coverage.In short its a pretty dismal outlook.  We have however inexplicably been in every game despite the shortcomings.  I think our secondary could be pretty good if we had any sort of pass rush.  Likewise if these receivers could just reliably catch balls when theyre wide open the run game would likely improve.  So eh yeah we could win if we make less mistakes but Im expecting Witten to have a  yard game and Randle will bust a series of  runs due to Anthonys tendency to overpursue hes young yet but its yielded some painful breakdowns in the run as far.  We wont get blown out but I imagine were going to find ourselves in a hole somewhere in the third quarter that well struggle to battle back from due to the events above.  Barring some overachieving we basically are just a very notgood team right now.,Saints,cvib6pm,10,t5_2s1wf

8768247,0,t1_d71nf9g,yeah but that was also  years ago. He hasnt kicked in an NFL game since . He was about at league average on longrange kicks when he was with us but he was really inaccurate inside of . In the last three years with us he was  on kicks  yds  on kicks  yds  on kicks  yds and  from . So again really good on the long ones but its really tough to justify a guy whos only hitting  of his FGs from inside  yards.  An interesting tidbit I found while looking into the details of his statline is that he actually has a lower career FG than pretty much every other guy weve tried since then and before him Barth Forbath Graham Kasay even John Carney. Meanwhile Dustin Hopkins . finished th in the NFL in FG last year while Hocker . and Forbath . finished nd and rd respectively out of  NFL kickers with  Field Goal Attempts last year.Maybe hes cursed us and we need to give him another chance to snap it?,Saints,d71p0pp,1,t5_2s1wf

10081219,0,t3_5jzfyb,Yea the best thing about this rivalry is having the opportunity to watch Brees play. That opportunity has allowed me to see a Saints team we all know is going to throw the football yet he still finds his targets with a high completion  and low INTs. What really stands out about Brees is his awareness in the pocket. He also displays excellent quickness able to get rid of the ball quickly and accurately to avoid sacks. He has to be one of the hardest QBs to sack.With that said Brees is the most disrespected QB of all time. The reason for that is because he plays for NO and not one of the big media cities that the talking heads adore. If Brees played for the NYG then they would all be lining up to give him MVP trophies while giving him a handjob.,Saints,dbllpjp,5,t5_2s1wf

The trading partner isnt giving up any high draft picks for the guy. So you lose your starter at a decent price and only would garner a th round pick if youre lucky.  There isnt any NFL team that is dying for Mark Ingram as their final piece to the organization.meaning.....we may not have the prettiest girls but they are the only girls in our neighborhood sooo....Who are your star players for the Saints?Brees Cooks Jordan Ingram Vaccaro Byrd Armstead Unger.Of those I believe the addition of Vonn Bell gives the flexibility of making Byrd or Vaccaro expendable.  Byrd as tradebait is not likely as his contract makes it prohibitive and he has underperformed for New Orleans. Vaccaro could provide value how much? to a team particularly some place like San Diego who lost a similar  styled player last season.

Edit Thanks to uzeeyellowdart I know know Im wrong. Ill post my reply to him here as well to further spread the message of my idiocyThats my bad for believing things I read on rNFL.

10800617,0,t1_ddu00ra,Exactly how I was feeling. Ingram is a hybrid monster. Clean with his movement and fights hard with his hands.

10815289,0,t3_5uhft6,I understand that this is a wishlist but Donta Hightower should not even be mentioned. There is no way New England is letting him walk. They purposely traded Chandler Jones and Jamie Collins so that they could focus on long term deals with Hightower and Butler.Now Melivn Ingram is more likely of a scenario because of the emergence of Joey Bosa. There is a chance they could let him test the free agaency market. I personally would love to sign Ingram seeing he has accumulated for . sacks over the last  years.Also I think Logan Ryan could be sneakily the best move in free agency if we can get him at the right price.,Saints,ddvird6,2,t5_2s1wf

11741211,0,t3_67jgpe,I really dont understand alot of the hate for this move by the front office. We have very little to lose and everything to gain from thisFor starters youre getting a player who teams have had to game plan against for years. Sure he hasnt played a entire season since  and even then he put up close to  yards. If teams gameplan around the fact we have both Drew Brees amp AP on the field thats really hard to adjust too. You stack the box and Drew is going to torch opposing secondaries you hang back and play zone and Adrian is going to run all over defenders.Second of all . million guaranteed for a guy on the other side of  is amazing value for what skills AP can bring to the team. If anything AP goes off this year and his ceiling is still AP at worse his basement is potentially another Tim Hightower.And thirdly this has potential to help the defense. We had so much trouble closing out games last year they practically always turned into shoot outs where we easily could of ran the ball to close the game out where instead we lose by a either a field goal or touchdown. Going forward this is going to make for a very strong RBBC that could potentially help us take control of the game clock with more run plays when we gain a comfortable lead in games.Even with us needing defense like crazy this year this also opens up more picks for us use on defensive starters in the first couple of rounds. I feel like this is one of the better signings weve made in the past couple of years. The upside to signing Adrian is immense with very little downside the way I see it. ,Saints,dgqw9sw,33,t5_2s1wf

11769549,0,t1_dgtvlsi,It is that simple. If our issue is at linebacker you solve it by drafting a linebacker. If our issue is at corner you solve it by drafting a corner. I get it Hooker is a highly rated player and you want to get the biggest bang for your buck but drafting him does nothing for us other than improve over a guy we traded multiple picks to draft last season. ,Saints,dgu3y64,1,t5_2s1wf

11775450,0,t1_dgus35c,Thats what I was assuming.  Im fine with or without him now anyways if he fell that far something must be wrong.  Although I must say if we get him I probably wouldnt complain.,Saints,dgus6yj,1,t5_2s1wf

11782509,0,t1_dgvjwlg,We shouldnt have drafted Ram because our Oline is solid already after the addition of Warford. That is where he fits in. All of this said at our spot at  there was no obvious choice to go over him. It just sucked watching so many people jump up for people they wanted and getting em in the last  picks before us. Sounds like were on the same page at QB. hopefully SP doesnt get crazy.,Saints,dgvl37t,1,t5_2s1wf

11796604,0,t1_dgx6emt,Would be a pretty cool thought. If hes smart he goes in and learns the game from his incredible coaches and peers. He knows he is ready physically now he turns the nuances of the game into his study and takes all he can in quickly.My only qualm is that how can we know if he really has a passion for the game? The drive to make those big plays?  You want to know this is his desire and purpose not just a job hes been practicing an interview for because of the pay.  You want to see the love now too.,Saints,dgx6ohn,2,t5_2s1wf
11797794,0,t1_dgxap75,I got sad and happy when he was picked. Glad he got picked so that he can reach that dream of being drafted but I wanted him so bad. ,Saints,dgxbjit,2,t5_2s1wf
