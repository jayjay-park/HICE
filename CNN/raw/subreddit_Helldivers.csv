3615712,0,t1_cq4dxis,I get where youre coming from but still can lead to harassment by doing this. And again Id like to point out that there is a bug the Devs acknowledged and is listed on this very redit that says people can get the Youve been kicked message when you actually were not kicked but simply disconnected from the game. Really the only troll like thing you experienced from this diver was the kick at the end no team killing Im assuming no trash talk or anything as well so this could very well be just a bug with the game and this guy is being labeled as an asshole for what very well could be a simple connection drop.The majority of disconnects people report are near extract so its hard to tell whether it was an actual kick or bug just saying. Without much more evidence besides the kick it could be that is all Im saying. If the guy did other crap like team killing harassing stealing stratagems etc then go for it and post a video of hisher transgressions for all to see and judge if they want to play with them or not ,Helldivers,cq4f110,0,t5_2ya0t

Youre glitched? leaving the game so another one can be the host is pretty overdramatic and unnecesary just abort and restart its not like youre a savior or a prophet just because youre the host. If you want to keep playing just screw the other players and abort.. Black box dropped? None of your teammates can pick it up? I dont know what youre talking about. I have never seen a situation where the black box cant be picked or is lost. Leaving for the next host to decide sounds super stupid as it doesnt fix anything. Just abort. I was in a situation once where the extraction code thing wouldnt appear and no enemies would appear on the map in the end we all killed ourselves after a few minutes. If a game seems unwinable because of a glitch just redo it.. Hosting a helldive and out of ammo? Why the hell would you not bring an ammo stratagem? Thats where you made your first mistake. Either way unless you have some really spammable and useful stratagems youre useless just kill yourself and get more ammo nobody really cares that much for a third star.. Your teammates just want to be reinforced in the spot theyve been continuously dying for the past  minutes? If you think you can make a run for it to the next objective without dying and reinforce them there do it. Ignore their requests of reinforcements remember youre the one who knows what youre doing and your judgement is most of the times above your teammates and that sometimes means leaving a capture objective for later when there are less enemies letting a teammate die say no to the path your teammates are taking so you can take a better route etc.Most of these issues sound sorta of meh to me.

4484929,0,t3_3chiyh,Just bought it. Only used against the bugs so far. The new pistols seemed pretty solid two of the three impressed me alot just on the bugs so far. The pistol perk really helps with ammo management and is basically like having five stratagems some may call that weak? Well see...The Flamethrower pistol was incredibly useful against bugs. And on the ground its a very powerful weapon to have. might even be the best ground weapon in the game. Stun grenades being my favorite ground weapon but since they dont deal damage I consider them defensive rather than offensive like the pyro pistol is. Its basically a one handed  level  flamethrower. Probably my favorite of the three so far fire and poison mix very well together so with the Paragon Avenger or even a weapon with stun this is good pistol to choose.P Gunslinger. Wow this gun packs a punch. If you like using weapons like the Camper or the Punisher then this is the pistol for you. One shot one kill basically and you get a free laser sight. Like the flamethrower you could feasibly do the whole helldive using only your perk pistol. I pretty much did tonight with bugs. Holds alot of ammo its just a solid gun and this will probably be the most popular of the three I suspect. The only negative is this gun and the flamethrower both have slower reload times compared to the standard default pistol which against cyborg hounds is very important. I cant remember what the reload time was for the third gun SingeSo the last gun Singe sounds like a magic sword out of a fantasy novel like the Hobbit. It has pretty blue lighting effects which look really cool. Against bugs it was my least favorite of the three for several reasons. It was difficult hitting with it not just because you need to be accurate but also because the plasma fired from it travels slow. Very slow so what would happen is my team mates would kill the enemy before the pistols plasma had a chance to hit its target. Also its not a weapon you want to fire close range it explodes when it hits. This is not ideal for using against bugs who like to rush. I suspect it will be much better against cyborgs and Illuminates though. Its meant for firing into crowds. So the fact that the shots explode make this a less than desirable gun for using when youre on the ground. When enemies are swarming you and youre trying to fight your way to your feet the last thing you need is a gun firing explosive rounds. For fighting on the ground when surrounded by enemies youre probably better off with the other two perk pistols or even the default one. But again this gun is meant for crowd control so well see how it handles the other two factions.,Helldivers,csvzmzg,6,t5_2ya0t

Now we need a frisbee to pass the time.A backpack full of Claiden Nerf Footballs from the movie Three KingsUnfortunately I cant provide a video reference so youll just have to take my word for it if you havent seen this amazing movie.

4855022,0,t1_cu6ggfw,Arrowhead has to be really careful doing a buff like that. First of all you can carry an EAT so having the same cooldown as Airstrike would IMO make it much better than airstrike. As you can call it down and equip let your timer recharge and hold on to the EAT till its needed. And a EAT is much safer to use than a Airstrike anyway and without the  second activation time the Airstrike has. It would also hurt overshadow the Recoilless. Why would you ever want to use a Recoilless that you could lose and that takes your backpack spot and deal with autoreload and all that stuff when you could just run EATs?The EAT does work well with a Kinetic shield. As most vets are probably aware one problem in the past with EATs and the problem now with Demolishers is you would go to fire it and then get knocked down by enemy fire before you could trigger the weapon. The Kinetic shield gives you that safe shot. You can do it with Demolishers too of course but the EAT I think has a bit more synergy with the SH as you dont have to get in quite so close so you can always stay facing the enemy. If you look at the boss fights or at least what I see is more players running EATs over Demolishers. Because with EATs you can keep more of a distance and so it has a tendency to be safer than when using Demolishers. I see alot of players running EATs with Jump Packs.,Helldivers,cu6ifsm,0,t5_2ya0t

5524391,0,t1_cwhe01l,Hes saying before the last patch nerfs. The Knight used to be one of the better primary weapons in the game. And fire used to damage heavy armor enemies just not tanks. Combine them with like a SH and you were a force to be reckoned with. Currently fire doesnt really work well against anything. It works on weak stuff but you probably wouldnt want to run it over a pistol because of its limited range and currently questionable use.What I would do though if I was running a Knight would be to run a SH and a Dum Dum as my secondary.

5961045,0,t1_cy0rgqu,The grenades far more flexible. You can use it for an escape or to avoid detection hold your ground or at least make enemies take a longer approach cook a tank that your available weapons arent hurting. Its faster than any comparable stratagem in a clutch situation and with a couple ammo boxes or a teammate wearing a resupply pack you can use it far more frequently.EDIT in open maps Stun Grenades are more useful. Drop one on yourself or toss one at a teammate to buy time for rescue  escape. Theyre like an autoinjector only you can also use it on someone else. They work for calling stratagems down on enemies as well.,Helldivers,cy10v3m,2,t5_2ya0t

6056544,0,t3_3yh1q8,The cool thing is there isnt any real right or wrong just trying out new things. Upgrade weapons you enjoy using strategems you find useful so on and so forth. If you pigeonhole yourself into only upgrading the right ones you lose out on the chance to experiment an find whats fun for you.A couple of strategems what are extremely useful to have are mentioned below. The Humblebee drone UAV for short is great at finding samples when fully upgraded which gives you a research point every  samples. Early levels will give you at least  samples a map and Helldive difficulty  can net you  per map. Having the UAV early is great for running easier levels and getting samples.Ammo and Respawn strategem are great for solo or party play. Of course Respawn only works with other players but if youre constantly playing with people who die which can happen more often when first starting out its great to be able to call them back sooner than later. Ammo is always great to have if youre shooting constantly which when starting out can happen quite often.I say experiment and find whats good for you. There are definitely some strategems more useful than others but it depends on the situation. Like the Minigun turret is great for mowing down large groups of enemies with little to no armor but the Railgun Turret ignores armor at the cost of firing speed.Dont really worry about research points. As you get better at the game the higher difficulties will net you more samples resulting in more points. Its part of the fun experimenting with different weapons and strategems. All the guns are good they just work differently.,Helldivers,cydie2r,1,t5_2ya0t

M Rumbler deadly as hell. Recommended but LEARN how to use it! AC DumDum works quite good against Illus after they lost their shields and borgs.Edit I am not sure about the RangerPack on PC because for us PSgamers it was a preorder and stweekpurchase bonus but Ill post it anywayRanger Pack  LHO Camper a Sniper Rifle works only with perfect aim or laser sight not very good low ROF makes it useless against scoutswarms and illu shields will soak the first shot anyways.

6672392,0,t3_46wdct,Youre misinformed about the problem.The only time you are connected to Arrowhead servers is on the mission results screen. The rest is handled via PSN and PP connections.Not being able to join a multiplayer game is based on you not having a good connection to the host. It would be nice if you could filter games by region so you would have better connection chances but usually not a big deal to try to connect to a couple of games at this screen.Getting kicked back to the menu is a PSN disconnect issue. You can see the side effects in other games Dying Light for me and other games have no issue with it Destiny for me. Likely Arrowheads hands are tied when it comes to this. The things they could do are make it so when you drop from PSN it boots the other players and leaves you in mission but in single player. Or make it just boot you back to your ship in single player or have the option at the menu to play offline. These changes would probably take a lot of time to implement though.Arrowhead has released plenty of information on this already.

6740372,0,t1_d0g5lzs,The nice thing about the Jump Pack is you can share and its obviously quite powerful. Although I have seen alot of bad behavior with some of the people who use Jump Packs. Such as leaving team mates in a precarious position or even leaving them behind to die. One thing I find annoying is when theyre blocking you from killing the enemies trailing behind you and not even bothering to kill them and then when the enemy is too close they jump out of the way leaving you to deal with the consequences.The Bubble Shield is very useful though and you can certainly protect team members from killing attacks and from charging hounds. But I do think having an Angel on the team is useful. What would you say is stronger  SHs or  SHs and an Angel? That one Angel is going to be able to handle all the healing needs of the group minus mech and vehicle maintenance in which case youd be better off with a Rep. Obelisks block Rep beams but dont stop Angels. You know its like the resupply pack a good all around utility for the group. Certainly carries a bit more personal risk though than using a Shield or Jump pack but the team benefits can easily outweigh that.,Helldivers,d0gigf7,1,t5_2ya0t

6776275,0,t3_48k8n0,Nice info. A couple Ive seen or used that I havent seen mentioned not only can you shield the damage from miscoding Disarm unexploded ordance you can apparently dodge it by diving prone.  Saw one diver on a recent dive vid posted here doing this deliberately behind his sweeping teammate  if this was you congrats on the nerves of steel! If using an ammobased loadout normal grenades are handy for deshielding groups of Tripods.  The followup from Breaker or Justice right after is quite satisfying as unstoppable suddenly becomes very relevant.Borg patrols are annoyingly tough but they do seem slightly more susceptible than the others to range tricks shoot some then kite out to reload or let a laser cool then run back to shoot seems to work for me. Cardio is quite good for this.Line of Sight caused by terrain can be a hassle but it can also be exploited well around objectives or extraction to make dealing with patrols easier or setting up fire corridors or combined with area denial. It can be handy coupled with being a bit away from the objective making it much easier to control approach lines and alerts.  I was not aware how useful putting napalmstaticmines out of alert range could be sometimes either  I need to work on that.  Im still pretty bad at controlling Defend and Geological surveys solo.Static to catch a big bug followed by Napalm is really rather fun.This one pretty obvious but Hulks can be persuaded to stand and shield still fairly easily even with the peacemaker making them ripe for a stratagem or even just a hellpod. Or just to gain distance or perhaps let a teammate shoot him in the posterior.Question Do the Arc weapons damage objectives? other than the hapless evac guys natch,Helldivers,d0kdhln,3,t5_2ya0t

If the stratagems are designed right certain stratagems benefit other stratagems to create complex interactions and multiple builds or playstyles would be possible.gtplayers only going to be interested in a subset to begin with so you can only consider combinations within that groupThats entirely my point variety and balance are woefully lacking in the stratagems and perks.,Helldivers,d15quq6,0,t5_2ya0t

7144015,0,t3_4decqu,The REP to me is a very situational tool. You can use it for so much more than teammate healing. Especially if you have teammates in a vehicle or a Mech. You can also bounce it off of various shit yadda yadda. For Level  missions for inexperienced players defense objectives such as the Rocket Launch Pad and the Geological Survey you can drop a Tesla tower ontop of them without killing the objective. You can use the REP to keep the Tesla alive while it zaps down enemy bug tanks and cyborg big dudes.Cyborg tank will always drive over it.Basically its situational. Depending on how you guys want to play you can choose to have a dedicated healer just make sure to pair the REP with the personal shield and have your team call in ready to go if you are the last man standing.

8396610,0,t1_d5qxkdj,Well keep in mind the flame throwerflame pistol is good for several reasons. Most players just look at damage and quickly dismiss it. However like the Railgun damage is deceptive because youre hitting multiple targets with a sweep. Not only that its one of the few weapons in the game where you can hit the enemy and run and the enemy will continue to take burn damage. This is very useful with stall like stun weapons or poison like a Paragon andor Avenger.And another reason the flamethrowerpyro is so good is because its extremely safe. Two of the safest weapons youll find in Helldivers. Its so safe you can actually use it from behind a team mate and if you keep your burst short you can actually kill the enemy or set them on fire without doing any damage to your team mates or even triggering their displacement field. Its that good. Worst case scenerio it will only knock a team mate down and once theyre down the fire from your weapon is put out. I love it for dogs just nicking them with a flamethrowerpyro means instant death. So just spray and dodge till they die. And sometimes they may knock you down before they die but theyll be dead seconds later. You wont get stuck in a falling down loop with the dogs you should be able to kill them regardless of the initial outcome. Does almost no damage to objectives mechs and sometimes no damage to vehicles.You can drop the free Hellfire Bombs and instead of detonating them as most like to do. You actually use it as a distractor beacon. Now heres the thing most weapons will one shot the hellfire bomb or put it at almost no health. The flamethrowerflame pistol do very little damage to a hellfire bomb you can actually do this trick multiple times. Same goes with an Avenger which does no damage to objectives or hellfire bombs. But whereas as an Avenger is extremely dangerous to team mates the flame pistolflamethrower is extremely safe. Great for trains great for sweeping great for getting enemies off a manned turret and not doing significant damage to the turret. Does like no damage to a HAV or not enough to worry about anyway.Its great with the railgun or smgs. I like using flame weapons with snipers. Flame a mob run back and use your sniper. Like I said works well with the Avenger. One really cool thing about it the flame pistol is it gives you an antimob weapon but you can still run your antitank secondary. I love it its just really good.Generally I prefer the flamethrower and a defensive perk. But Ill run the Pyro on occasion because I really like it. If your running stall with it should be fine.Flamethrower and Pyro are also excellent with barbwire. I use them quite often for retalitory strike. You basically take down everything quickly except the heavies.,Helldivers,d5r4g49,1,t5_2ya0t
