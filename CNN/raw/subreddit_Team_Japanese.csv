22139,0,t3_1ub6ge, hours a week is solid study time!  It may help if you start reading aloud to yourself to get a little bit more comfortable talking aloud   find a short dialogue and read it through until you can recite it fairly fluently  its a good workout for your reading and your tongue  Good luck this year!,Team_Japanese,cegycmk,1,t5_2vuty

253511,0,t3_1wztb4,gt Carry on from where I was last? Keep going with everyone else? I would say keep going with everyone else. Most people will miss a week or two sometimes.gt Im trying the pomodoro technique this week rgetstudying seems to plug it a lot. Simply you do  minute sessions one pomodoro with  minute breaks and a longer break every  pomodori using a kitchen timer to track it. Hearing the clicking combined with the visual feedback of progress being made is actually really great. Everyone should try this technique. I tally up my pomodori each day. Current record is  in one day but Ill be trying to beat that over the coming month. pomodori is really impressive and it sounds like a technique that could be helpful if you need to study a lot but I dont think its anything for me. With the amount of time I have available for studying Ill never be able to do more than one pomodori in one sitting and maybe two pomodori in total on a weekend when I have a little bit more time on my hands.My method is instead to try to take advantage of any small breaks I get like visits to the toilet and do a bit of Anki on my phone and that way rack up some study time over the whole day.,Team_Japanese,cf714d0,1,t5_2vuty

2959020,0,t3_2tvt4b,I use the TRY series for grammar. It has short explanations with a handful of examples and some practice after each point as well as a quiz at the end of every chapter. Super simple. Of course its not good enough on its own but the lesson points get reinforced for me when I see the grammar in other places.I have the hardest time putting new grammar into practice so I just focus on one or two points a day and try and apply it in the rest of my studies ie. look for it in writing plug new vocab into it use it in conversations.If anyone has good advice for quickly digesting grammar and putting it into practice I would hear it.,Team_Japanese,co4ge54,1,t5_2vuty
2991214,0,t3_2uc8pw,Previous weekI started reading the novel  on Tuesday and it turned out to be much more vocabulary that I dont know in this book than it looked like in the bookstore when I looked at it. It has a fantasymedieval setting so there are a lot of vocabulary on that theme that I havent seen before.The characters in the book live in the village named  and I assumed was just a name and when they talked about  it was just a shorter form for the village. But then after a while it didnt make any sense at all and I realized that  is actually some large snakedragon like animal.Ive only read about  pages or so of the book so I think Im going to start over from the beginning again and to try to understand it better now that I know what  is. I think Ill try to look up all the words I dont know as well to actually understand everything a little bit better and pick up som fantasy related vocabulary even though it might be up to  words per line. I did that when I read on Friday and it felt like it went better than when I only look up very few words like I normally do.Graph of WaniKani progress Anki Summary Type|Number of cards|||Young  Learning |   | Mature |   | Unseen |   | Suspended |     | Total | | Next week Ill restart with  and try to look up a bit more unknown vocabulary as I read it. Hopefully I should be still able to read about two pages before I have to get off the bus. Its a pretty slow pace but at least its something.

3373374,0,t3_2ylosq,One thing that I learned within the first few months of learning is that its important to not spend all of your time learning how to learn. I spent my first couple of months or so just spending most of my time browsing rLearnJapanese and bookmarking resources that I didnt spend much time actually learning the language.Then theres also those what did you wish you knew when you started? threads like this and this and probably more over on rlanguagelearning. I always love those type of threads.,Team_Japanese,cpcsfik,3,t5_2vuty
