6959168,0,t3_4axgjv,Hey man! I was the rechartering president at Beta Psi up at UCLA. Feel free to PM me if youd like to chat or Skype. I probably can offer a unique perspective on the process in Province  and why theres frustration present. Id like to say that its normal to feel that way. There are a lot of things to do at the beginning of the process that are not rewarding. Get through your first night. Listen to what the brothers have to say and look within yourself to see if what they say rings true to you. At that point take stock. Get there first. Like I said earlier Im happy to talk. Lmk if youd like to. I obviously strongly discourage anyone from dropping and there is a reason that the brothers are saying what they are. Theres a lot of truth that youre simply not aware of yet and that process of awakening takes time.,Sinfonia,d155n24,3,t5_2sntl
