Of course they did pick voker and he handled it shitty and left the lobby once cap had a horrid nd pick but the guy knows his shit even though he handles it poorly.If youre honest with the guy he wont be a dick I ganked his lane as a shaman and he was either a weaver or a klinkz or some bursty offlaner that needed farm more than I did and we were against dp and dazzle.  He got pissed at me because we took so long to kill the dp dazzle used grave less than a minute earlier and I shackled dp I ended up dying and he had to head to base.  He overreacts as usual and asks why I didnt ether shock and I just respond calmly with oh it looked like you had enough burst and I was hoping youd get the last hit not even sure how dazzle shadow waved him at like  hp and he didnt rage the rest of the game.Hes actually a pretty smart player that can teach you quite a bit he just has a temper problem that gets in the way sometimes.  Honestly it shouldnt be too hard to put up with or easy to change once your teamwork gets better as the season goes along.

1609736,0,t3_2cqmlp,I dont think anyone blames you for wanting to play with your friends.  We all want to play with our friends.  I think what got people to go after you was the combination of a few factors There were a bunch of really low activity accounts that all had links to you.  Youve explained them now but as a captain looking at prospects I saw a bunch of questionable accounts that all mostly play together.  The obvious conclusion was that youre trying to stack with smurfs. Having these accounts so linked puts the other captains in an awkward spot.  For one its harder to assess the skill of an account with only a couple hundred games especially when they play with each other a bunch.  They may also quit or not give their all if they dont get with their friends.  You are yourself one of the better players in the league which means your team had a bit of a built in advantage anywayThe bottom line for most of us was that it was a no win situation.  Sure we could have picked your friends but their skillinterest was hard to determine based on such inactive accounts besides Wonderbread.  There was also the added risk of getting someone who flat out wont play without their friends.  Since theyre all pretty low activity accounts its not like they lose anything by bailing they can play on another account if they really want to RDL again.  I dont begrudge you what should be a fun season of playing with your friends but do try to understand how it would appear to go against the spirit of the league to most of us based on what was in the player signups.I dont think you need to give up your playoff spot.

4105307,0,t1_cro0gny,Let me tell you a tale a tale of a young boy who wanted to be a man.There was once a boy who had a dream. He dreamed that he would find happiness among his friends and bring justice upon the world. He worked hard day and night to become the hero that the rdl needed. There were times when he threw there were times when he had to play drow ranger but those times did not hinder his progress to becoming the embodiment of justice.One day however the boy witnessed something something that would change his whole life. As he walked down the lane caressing his newly bought wards like they were his babies he checked mid lane to see if Treebeard was doing alright. Thats when he saw it. Before his eyes Treebeard was drinking his bottle.... WITH HIS STRENGTH TREADS.Then something magical happened. A little bit of the boy died inside and the boy learned that efficiency turns into poison as it slips through your fingers. The poison tainted him changing him into a being unknown to him or mankind. The boy realized that while the rdl may have needed him rdl sure as hell did not deserve him nor the wards that he was carrying around. So then and there he threw down the wards into his fountain and did the only thing he could do to save mankind from certain destruction.He opened the player tab.Then he reported FUCKING EVERYONE.,redditdota2league,cro89ze,6,t5_2w8vi

They have a great attitude and it was actually FUN playing with them. I dont think I could have asked for better teammates. What do you feel could have been done better? I think for our division there are too many DNPs. I think to prevent this from happening SO much we should only let captains who played in previous seasons be captains. I also think we should take note of ppl who miss a lot of games and ban them for a season or two. If you are the captain and your first pick guy quits then that ruins that team and the balance of the division. Do you have any ideas for the upcoming season or inhouse league? I played around  IH matches from ss. It was OK at the beginning but it went to shit quickly at least for me. Too many egos fighting flaming and etc. The last IH I played our team was losing and around  mins in Guest starts intentionally feeding. I mean isnt that ban worthy? How are people suppose to take inhouses rules seriously if modsadmins do this. Maybe ppl enjoy memeing clowning around and flaming but its just not my cup of tea.

9028060,0,t3_53vuon,Just want to make notice the very last point gt Axial.gg  This is a team management platform that has multiple tools that are at your disposal  for absolutely free. You can schedule scrims with outside teams that are around your teams average mmr fill out an easy to follow schedule and much much more. Check it out and let us know what you think RDL is currently copromoting with Axial.gg and we know theyd love feedback form our captains and players on the platform.These guys are trying to do something that hasnt been done to my knowledge for gaming. I suggest at least signing up and taking a look at the system. There are quite a few tools they provide that you may find useful. Some of the teams on the site have been using our discord to find scrims too! Axial have been really kind to reach out to us and offer all of this. They will also have tournaments for prizes! ,redditdota2league,d7x14ag,1,t5_2w8vi
