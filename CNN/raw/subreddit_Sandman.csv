281708,0,t1_cf9aagg,Endless are the embodiment of whatever they represent therefore I feel that the safeguards that Destruction set up when he left could not have resulted in anything but destruction. I am not sure about Death having to or wanting to experience life she does die by the end she says something along the lines of there being no other way of ending life. Since Death does experience deathI am not sure about birth since she does have a conversation with a person before heshe is born Dream does or may choose to experience dream. Dream was locked away in a binding that did not let him leave anywhere I do not see how he could then have dreamed in that situation when all doors to any dimension where locked from him,Sandman,cf9ynpg,1,t5_2u0xa

1460104,0,t3_2aslo5,Im glad to have more Sandman but the delays have definitely been disappointing. And sadly Im also not too impressed with the first two issues so far.,Sandman,cizasf4,1,t5_2u0xa
1618307,0,t3_2cujkl,Thats incredible ,Sandman,cjj5k0j,3,t5_2u0xa
1871425,0,t1_ckeokhc,That would be the one. I was like Neil at this stage in the series trying to figure out what this series was going to be about.  When the kids show on TV advised the proper way to cut ones wrists I knew this series was different from any other series I had read and was going to be reading the whole thing. ,Sandman,ckep7kd,3,t5_2u0xa

2333752,0,t3_2m1f6r,It is the most intelligent comic I have ever read. But you dont have to be into highbrow shit to enjoy it.If you enjoy good stories its all about stories which make you feel things you will love these books.Something I get frustrated by with most mainstream comics is the way the story arcs seem so forced and final. With Sandman I found all the smaller arcs to be part of a tapestry which created a beautiful epic. And we havent been told even the smallest percentage of what has occurred in this world. I can never encourage anyone enough Read It! You will be so glad you did!,Sandman,cm05xcl,4,t5_2u0xa
2482677,0,t1_cmikv21,Yeah he would make a good Dream. Really liked him in Watchmen. JGL just seems so young to play him.,Sandman,cmimhjd,2,t5_2u0xa
3201506,0,t3_2w930j,Can anyone tell me where i can get the latest info on Sandman? I really like the series but since its like a trimonthly thing i never know when the new issue comes out.,Sandman,cotu385,1,t5_2u0xa
4016287,0,t1_crdw0kq,Yeah I already saw the trailer. I dont know whether its an adaptation of the comics though.So at best its a terribly bland fantasy copmystery series  l Forever and at worst its copyrightowning Fox execs trying to grab onto the license until someone wants to buy it. Can you even trademark the lord of Hell though?,Sandman,cre35bp,3,t5_2u0xa
4092743,0,t1_crms3wt,She was definitely my first thought.  I just think opposite sex twins being swapped out through every scene would be too perfect though plus cheaper.,Sandman,crmsqfy,1,t5_2u0xa
4192026,0,t1_cry33c6,There is something amazing about a good cosplay and them doing everyday things.  I have a pic somewhere of Gambet taking money out of an atm.  Also I just looked for it and I have none of me in cosplay.  I did see a really good Del a few years ago she had the crazy hair wig and everything.,Sandman,cry38ta,2,t5_2u0xa

5703803,0,t1_cx401i3,Its a good movie if you take it as inspired by hellblazer instead of based on it. ,Sandman,cx4423f,2,t5_2u0xa
5720590,0,t1_cx5xax0,Neat!,Sandman,cx671te,1,t5_2u0xa
7313656,0,t3_4fgeva,maybe like Googles Deep Dream? I tried it out!,Sandman,d29ih64,2,t5_2u0xa
7904140,0,t1_d21yz31,Hello thats the one I mean And yeah i decided to go through with the comics since they were the original format theyre not a disappointment so far,Sandman,d44i1gt,1,t5_2u0xa
9878724,0,t3_5gt6rj,P. Craig Russel is an outstanding artist outside the Sandman series as well. Check out his Gotterdammerung series.,Sandman,dav7ypq,3,t5_2u0xa
