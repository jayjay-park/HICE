101233,0,t3_1v8iml,As to  I find it helps to hold the banjo neck more parallel to the ground.  If you hold it elevated your brush and bum will be at a bad angle to the strings.  Even though so much is made about bumditty most things I play only have an occasional frail.  I like what I think is called double thumbing where instead of the frail you just go from the melody note to thumb to melody note with no brush stroke.Like this,banjo,cepyfrv,1,t5_2qlrg

520273,0,t3_2036m7,For the moment dont worry about tuning to a specific source tone. If you would like to get a feel for the sound of a banjo tuned to itself then read on. For this tutorial the th string will be closest to your face and the st string will be closest to your feet.. Put your finger on the th string at the th fret. Pluck it and make the rd string sound just like it.. Put your finger on the rd string at the th fret. Pluck it and make the nd string sound just like it.. Put your finger on the nd string at the rd fret. Pluck it and make the st string sound just like it.. Pluck the rd string open. Make the th string sound just like it but one octave higher.. Repeat these steps a few more times because adjusting the string tension can affect the head tension which can indirectly affect the other strings tuning.Listen for the waves getting longer as the notes get closer together. This is hard to explain. Its sort of like listening between the lines. As the two notes become more similar their waveforms go through dissonance This resolves when the notes are identical. The THX link above is not a perfect example but it works I guess. When you cant perceive the waves anymore then they are tuned to the same note. ,banjo,cfzeqw0,6,t5_2qlrg

But the trip from Nashville to South Dakota will definitely mess with this set up. Drastic temperature and pressure changes from air shipping. Mine was ice cold when I took it out of the box. So I would recommend ordering as is and while you wait find a good luthier in your area and make an appointment for right after the expected arrival date. Bring it to him and have him check it over and make any necessary adjustments as well as putting on new strings and a better bridge. A good set if strings and a good bridge will be about  bucks. Plus you can have him add spikes while youre there. The entire thing should cost less than .  ,banjo,chkngo5,2,t5_2qlrg

Their Blueridge guitars are incredible for the price.Definitely Gold Stars are an option if youre looking for that  to  range. As I said Im a fan of the satin finish so I tend towards the Recording King banjos in that range. But there is NOTHING wrong with a properly set up Gold Star. Its important to note though that Toms Gold Star is a little different breed from the current Gold Stars being made. One of the lesserknown coveted banjos out there is an early JD Crowe Gold Star banjo Theyre pretty rare but beautiful instruments and would be a similar quality to Tom Adams. For those who may not know Toms a monster who now suffers from focal dystonia where there is a disconnect in regards to nerve endings from brain to fingers.

My personal belief is that they are a vital part of the learning process and they are always followed by a huge burst of advancement.Some of the ways to get through them Brute force Take a complicated or challenging piece and simply work on it. Set a specific amount of time every day to work on it. It will be like work for a chunk of it. But eventually something will click. Change of pace. Learn something completely outside your element or interest or comfort zone. It doesnt matter how silly or useless you think it is. Rediscover. Go back to what initially got you interested in banjo. Study it with your new found knowledge. Sometimes you can see something you missed when you were just learning. That can sometimes cause a breakout. Keep trying to find someone to play with. Doesnt matter what level they are at. Doesnt matter what instrument they play. Go to some open mics. Go to some jams. Seriously good luck.

6147450,0,t3_3ygpzc,Ive always argued that theyre a banjo because of the way they make the sound. You must ask yourself what makes a banjo a banjo? What is the essence of the banjo?  strings? Well string tenor banjos rule that out. Tuning? Banjos can be tuned dozens of ways. Vibrating string move a floating bridge on top of a drum head. To me thats the essence of a banjo. Anything that produces sound with that method is a banjo regardless of number of strings shape or tuning.So by this logic a string banjo is just that a banjo. Just like a banjouke or a tenor banjo. One thing to note Theres actually two types of strings. Theres the typical string Banjitar basically a guitar neck on a banjo body. But theres also a lesserknown string banjo tuned in Open G with an even lower G string between the lowD and highG.

6616567,0,t1_d03ewhq,Yup! You can go an octave higher yes. The entire scale restarts at the th fret and you make the same chord shapes for the same chords. However you dont have to be a full octave higher. For example if you make the F chord and slide it  frets up thats another G chord. And if you make a barre chord at the th fret thats your next C and then you can slide that up to the th fret for another D. Alternatively you can make the D chord shape and slide it up to the th fret. Thats another G. Then go up one more fret and make a F chord again and thats another C. Slide that same shape up  more frets and youve got another D. You can do this with all the chords. These are called movable chords. And once you know the chords well you can make partial chords or play individual notes within the chords for melody. I think thats called chord theory if you want to look it up a bit. Its a nice way to change up your sound without knowing melody though. Play once through from the open position then the second time through you can play from the rd position. Same chords but different voicing. If you know the three major shapes FDBarre you can move them anywhere on the fretboard and get any major chord you want. Then you can also learn the minor chords and move those around too for the same effect. For example Aminor from the th fret is another Eminor. Combine all this with your basic chord progressions above and youve got a pretty good base for being able to play along in different keys.,banjo,d03pjya,2,t5_2qlrg

6954874,0,t3_4ayual,Ive been playing for a few years and have only recently met real live banjo players. If youre prepared for some frustration I recommend learning Banjo In The Hollow as arranged by Douglas Dillard. My banjo sensei threw it at me a few weeks ago and I wish I had learned it before anything else. It teaches really good practices like pickingrolling efficiency and makes the advantages of open G tuning super obvious. Im no expert but I encourage the hell out of new pickers. PM me if you want a banjo pen pal ,banjo,d14o2ck,3,t5_2qlrg

7346166,0,t3_4fqelt,Looks like most of the best technical players have been mentioned already. Im assuming that it goes without saying because apparently no one has? that you should listen to Earl Scruggs himself. When interviewed by Tony Trischka and asked the question what he thought he brought to the banjo his answer was syncopation. Its worth listening to his playing with that in mind. Though it isnt often hugely inventive melodically his timing and syncopation still sound fantastic.I think its also worth mentioning Ralph Stanley who always seems to get left out of discussions like this. Most people will say that what he does is very basic indexlead mostly forward rolls but Id say that those people havent listen to that many Ralph Stanley instrumentals and that theyre disregarding his tone. No other banjo player before or since in my opinion can hold a candle to Ralph Stanley when it comes to tone though check out Matthew Henderson who appears to be getting damn close... He also does some interesting things rhythmically too and uses some quite unorthodox rolling patterns check out Bully of the Town Midnight Ramble and Hard Times in particular likely because of his start in clawhammer and finger style playing. Not to mention he wrote the best banjo instrumental of all time the Clinch Mountain Backstep.Its always worth looking at the inspirationstutors of the modern great banjo players to get a good feel for what they were building on. Greg Cahill taught Noam Pikelny and is a fantastic banjo player with tons of drive. Tony Trischka taught Bela Fleck as has been mentioned. Both Greg and Tony are huge fans of Earl of course but also of JD Crowe and Bill Keith.Personally as well as all the above I think Blake Williams is a pretty great banjo player that isnt often mentioned. He played with Bill Monroe in his later years and still plays now. He plays some extremely inventive breaks that manage to stay away from some of the more common banjo cliches but without losing that drive or syncopation.,banjo,d2d7ilg,1,t5_2qlrg
