237147,0,t1_cf3mx5o,I was just thinking everybody here seems to use Keon except you. Can you check with another ZTE Open owner? That might be a device specific issue.Also do report a bug or find an already existing one in Bugzilla. At least it might tell you if you are the only one having this issue. If it is so you can try to speak to ZTE customer service or try to reset your phone but you might have done this already. If you are not it might give you an idea of how to fix it...,FireFoxOS,cf5bw9z,0,t5_2uf82
443804,0,t1_cfqfzwv,What I dont understand is why would FF at least on the technology level collaborate anything with the carriers on OS updates? Shouldnt that be the device makers? ,FireFoxOS,cfqrk2q,1,t5_2uf82
581965,0,t3_20svgs,I dont have a device right now but I love to see new useful apps being created so kudos!One thought I have is that many users arent tech savvy and would avoid using an app where they have to markup their own text for formatting.  I think theres at least one open source WYSIWYG editor for markdown no?.  My thought is that once text selection lands in FxOS . hopefully use such an editor and make a radial menu for quick formatting changes.,FireFoxOS,cg6f9k6,1,t5_2uf82
1035723,0,t1_chm04ab,Not sure what to tell you. Works for me. Im on ..Be interesting to know if anyone else on . has the same experience.  It might be worth filing a bug,FireFoxOS,chm0lvg,1,t5_2uf82

2987292,0,t1_co7imbf,Im stuck with the infamous ZTE Open. They havent released the closed drivers so AFAIK not even Mozilla can compile the latest version for the device.I really hope they work out something but right now its still difficult.,FireFoxOS,co7moqg,2,t5_2uf82

3044058,0,t1_codhva8,Understood Geeksphone is appealing because its cheaper but I can at least use multirom on the Nexus  and since Flame is EOL then I will probably go with the Nexus.,FireFoxOS,codikxh,1,t5_2uf82

4559371,0,t3_3dfsds,As a Mozilla Reps i can say that the Firefox OS community is different for the other because is a Mozilla project.Not exist a mainly center of aggregation in Mozilla there are local community like in my case Mozilla Italia.I see the enthusiasm on twitter and in the local community that organize many events that the other system that youve cited dont do.As an example in the last year for Firefox OS in my country ive organized other  events for Firefox OS I suggest you to follow the suggestion of klez,FireFoxOS,ct5brjt,2,t5_2uf82

4924924,0,t1_cuf26im,gt I would think that this would be limited to what Mozilla puts on the device. Mozilla may be working with them but I imagine Panasonic who seems to be making this device will be the most significant driver behind what apps ship on it other than the basics obviously.,FireFoxOS,cufbq7h,1,t5_2uf82
5787948,0,t3_3uf92h,gt I have never built an android or Firefox OS image before thoughThe only hard part will be getting device tree stuff for the LGL. Mozilla has the trees for all of their other devices but they have none for the LGL I suppose theyd refer to it by the codename madai?. When I was building for the LG Volt they had to borrow from the G Mini and LG F devices trees  along with ganking the init etc. from the Volt  to build the device tree. Something similar can be done for the LGL. Its not fun though and I was not able to get a good working setup by myself but others on AndroidForums were able to bring that Volt up with aplomb.This is just another LGQualcomm device it is possible its only a matter of effort.Once you have the device setup you toss in the kernel then you can build for FxOS and Android with ease yes?gt  I also feel that the availability of a custom recovery like Clockworkmod wouldOnce you have the device setup down building CWM and TWRP is simple.gt A forum like XDA Developers would probably be a better place to continu If you dont like XDA you could try AndroidForums. Its okay.gt I think there is a post quota to reach before one can create new threads tooI think the quota is only  posts. They do have a FirefoxOS subforum there it seems to be alive. Im really surprised at how little info there is out there on the LGL. Hasnt it been out for nearly a year now? I would have expected its ways and means would already be exposed and welltamed.,FireFoxOS,cxejsfe,3,t5_2uf82

6166199,0,t3_3zzszx,I thought Mozilla turned in the towel on carriersupported FirefoxOS Phones. Their focus may shift to other connected devices like routers TVs but they appear completely lost as to their next move similar to Palms WebOS.From the beginning I had hoped they would focus on TabletsHybrids similar to ChromeOS. With their shift to support Chrome Extensions killing their own XUL Framework in the process I halfexpect that we might see a ChromeOS alternative on tablets pure speculation on my part. Honestly though without a better mousetrap strong local support offline apps offline storage I just dont see FirefoxOS doing much in the foreseeable future.,FireFoxOS,cyqj777,1,t5_2uf82
