1253640,0,t3_28b7am,Ye this is strange. This shouldnt be the case. I received a short training Only three days but thats because they saw I was catching on quickly and afterwards starting working all of that being payed. I dont know why you wouldnt get payed for the training. But of course you will have to go to another location for training because thats what I have to do. Since Subway can be franchised some owners can be total douchebags. But yes like someone else here said call corporate andor talk to your manager or supervisor about this because this isnt right. Come back with any more questions and good luck!,subway,cianecx,1,t5_2s1gj
2645813,0,t3_2q6t96,This used to happen to the sandwiches we made because there was something broken with the toaster. After we got it fixed it started heating the meat all the way through again. Its either that or the employees are using the wrong setting the meat is frozen and not thawed or you have a crap load of extra stuff on your sandwich before you toast it. Im guessing its just a broken part though. And yes I would complain. It wasnt that hard of a request and they should have better customer service than that.,subway,cn3xuk4,2,t5_2s1gj

3437619,0,t1_cpk0gr0,Its not punishment. Its the simple fact that ordering a second sandwich with the same type of meat makes ABSOLUTELY ZERO DIFFERENCE than ordering a second sandwich with a different kind of meat than the first. LITERALLY NOTHING CHANGES. You reach in the cooler extract a meat scoop or  pieces of meat or whatever and you put it on the sandwich and proceed to make the rest of the sandwich according to their specifications.  DIFFERENT  INCH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  OF THE SAME MEAT AND  OF DIFFERENT MEATS. NONE.,subway,cpk44ck,0,t5_2s1gj

8222507,0,t3_4rvy2x,Yeah your anticipations are probably correct.  Weve never had a location within a hospital but we have a few hospital locations.  The demographic at our stores is mainly hospital staff but I imagine youll get a lot more patients and family members being located within the hospital campus.  They can be a bit grumpy.As a lowly sandwich artist you make an impact on the lives of dozens even hundreds of people every day.  Most difficult customers are just decent people having a bad day  this is especially true with the hospital demographic.  These are the people that approach the counter pissed and leave the register with a smile on their face.  Giving these people a pleasant break from their hard day will give you much job satisfaction and the positive attitude you maintain in doing so will take you places in the future.  As for customers that are simply jerks I like to call it sadistic grace.  Nothing says screw you like a big smile and a show of overthetop hospitality.  ,subway,d55dbfl,6,t5_2s1gj

I mentioned this because it is super easy to ingest a fuckload of sodium at Subway and as such you should be conscious of the decisions youre making re sodium if youre looking to maintain a healthy diet including frequent subway sandwiches.Good talk.,subway,dasyi3q,2,t5_2s1gj

10166667,0,t3_5l8f2c,gt How late after close are you other closers usually at your store?  My store closes at  and Im the only person working past  during which time were drivethru only. Unless someone comes by after  I can usually finish up by  or  if the computer decides to do an automatic restart which is stupid because I always restart it anyway but if its automatic I cant clock out first. Other closers are usually gone exactly at  but thats because they turn off the lights and stop serving customers early.gt How do you deal with drunkvery slow customers without being rude?  Fortunately I havent had to deal with that. Probably after ten minutes Id tell him that he needs to finish his order quickly or leave.gt Where the hell is this free time and how do I get some?

10217470,0,t3_5m7dkt,It does suck to own a store and I have been trying to stay positive.  Unfortunately as owners we are working to go broke.  Way too MANY stores combined with some upper DAI management that out of touch.  Upper management does not have a hunger to produce higher sales as many are reaching the end if their careers.  Close stores get rid of dead wood from upper management from the top down and involve franchisees in sales building.  Above all remember PROFITABILITY!!!!  Still using BOGO coupon logic from decades ago???  ,subway,dc27hqy,2,t5_2s1gj
