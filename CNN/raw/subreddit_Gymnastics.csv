If you are only able to go to a gymnastics class once every few weeks and without good coaching it probably isnt worth it and you might want to try some sort of martial arts or yoga instead. If you can go once a week or more is always great! and you have a coach who is willing to work with you to improve what you want to improve then I definitely think you should try it out. Although some people have been able to self teach themselves gymnastics I really do believe it is a lot easier with an adult class or a coach. ,Gymnastics,cm9p4l0,5,t5_2r0th

Mikulak  should not be used on hb in tf due to his massive inconsistency. On floor Dam and Jake were above . except for Sams disaster of a first day which unlike hb I think was an anomaly.

8561030,0,t1_d6bomz9,So I guess this is an area where MAG and WAG rules differ.  If Im reading what you said right Simone has a Routine Skills Form filled out and it says something like Wieler Kip with or without  turn thats approvedsubmitted by the Teams head coach and reviewed by a panel of judges before she competes and she can do either skill without a deduction other than execution errors?  If thats the case that totally makes sense.  In my case it would have been sort of impractical because If I were to write down my routine back then it would have had  planned fullturns and a total of  times passing through a handstand.  It was a pretty short routine but depending on how close I played it when trying to hit handstands it could have been  turns and  giants and still started from .  I couldnt write out all the possible ways it could have played out...that was what the judges were being paid for and that was fine with me because I was paying for them to do their job.I wasnt aware that Japan would have won in  without this rule and I agree that its fairer.  I should say that I was pretty successful for myself without ever breaking the rules.  I did more than my fair share to point out how messed up their rules were and I was met with what I would describe as dire consequences.  I guess thats a story for another time though.,Gymnastics,d6bpf6w,0,t5_2r0th

9817187,0,t3_5fu7dv,Here are some hopefully helpful questions and answers to considerQ Do they have the armgripcoreback strength to do what youre asking of them?A Without strength there will be no skills. Try making light conditioning into a game! Who can hang on the bar longest? Who can climb the rope the highest? Who can do the most swings? All of these can also easily be transformed into less competitive versions like Can you climb higher than before? Can you do more swings than last class?Q Have you taughtbeen teaching progressions that exercise the body position handwrist position and muscles needed to do a front support on the bar?A If theyre practicing front support on the bar I will assume they have mastered the front support on the floor. Some ideas for simple progressions include front support with a tight body on a floor bar added challenges move shoulders up and down move thumbs over bar and back and incurvebananahollow body rocks on the floor.Q Are they leaning over the bar? Are their handswrists in the proper position?A If their wrists to arms to shoulders create a vertical line above the bar physics by default will bring them down. Their hands should be gripping more over the bar and their wrists should sit the weight slightly over the bar past vertical. Thumbs should go with the rest of the fingers. This will have their shoulders leaning over the bar forward with their hips resting on the bar their body balancing on a tilt.That should be a good start  goodluck!,Gymnastics,dan74rb,8,t5_2r0th
