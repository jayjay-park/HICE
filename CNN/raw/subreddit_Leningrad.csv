526265,0,t1_cg02ddg,Well get better bud!I know there are a bunch of plans for rails coordinating efforts would be a good thing! We have some proposed plans Ill try to get people to post.I think we can work out some sort of system where every city has an equal representative in the united Military. Because leading defenses is not to difficult coordination should not be that bad between the number of heads. Again this will need to be hammered out probably over mumble or something.I agree that the combined vaults will be tricky at times but a large proponent is that this alliance will not interfere with sovereignty. If a nation part of this alliance has enough proof to sentence a criminal then there should be no question from other nations. I am all for a  accountable system no breaking your friends out if they are guilty. On that stance if there is not enough evidenceno evidence then the charge should be dropped if the other nations ask of it. This I agree also needs to be talked about over Mumble or other open forum with all member nations.Im always glad to have you guys on my side I look forward to working with you guys. Get healthy.CheersMulificus,Leningrad,cg03c4v,2,t5_2uhei
