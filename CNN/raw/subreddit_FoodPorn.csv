409,0,t3_1u4qsk,Heres the album.I got a dessert book as a Christmas present and decided to put it to use for New Years! I made a strawberry marmalade and coulis from frozen strawberries since they arent in season. I used the marmalade in the ice cream a very fatty ice cream I might add. The crpes were made quickly.I placed two balls of ice cream on a crpe and tied it up like a pouch using the vanilla plants from which I got the vanilla seeds. I found that they werent long enough sadly so the ones showcased here are actually double length tied together.I added a bit of red fruit colouring E iirc since I didnt think the ice cream looked red enough from just the marmalade. The strawberry taste was pleasantly nice and fresh however!,FoodPorn,ceehhb1,12,t5_2rd9v

893057,0,t1_ch5huir,Nurses have trouble finding jobs??  I have always heard there is a constant need and shortage of nurses.  I know several nurses and they say they can pretty much work at any of the  large to medium sized hospitals in the area as long as they arent picky about the department.  One of them does float pool and another motherbaby so obviously the float pool friend has more options.  The rate for them St. Louis MO I think is about hr give or take  with  years experience.  They both do nights and weekends for the extra  and  differential pay.  So it all depends on cost of living dictating wages.  That Oakland rate seems good but I bet there is dangerpersonal safety risk that jacks that rate up a bit.Banks are cautious about handing out loans after the Great Recession.  You have high demand careers going for you so that will factor into their decision to give you a loan.  The smart thing to do is to buy a starter home for five years that you can easily afford while putting aside money for retirement and your next home.  The rule of thumb is never take on a mortgage that is more than  of your take home pay.,FoodPorn,ch5smep,1,t5_2rd9v

From     Ingredients  For the Empanadas         poblano chiles       tablespoons canola oil       cups shredded chicken I used rotisserie chicken       medium onion chopped       cloves garlic minced       cup chicken broth       tomatillos finely chopped       oz baby spinach      Salt and pepper to taste       cup sour cream       tablespoon lime juice       pack of  empanada discs defrosted       large egg lightly beaten with  tablespoon water    For the Dip         Hass avocados       cup sour cream      Juice of  limes       jalapeno pepper finely chopped and seeds removed       tablespoons chopped cilantro       cloves garlic minced      Salt and pepper to taste    Directions        Roast the poblanos directly under the broiler turning every  minutes until all of the skin has blackened and the pepper is soft. Place the roasted poblanos in a paper back and fold the top to close and let cool for about  minutes or until cool enough to handle. Peel off all of the blackened skin and pull out the stem and seeds. Slice the roasted peppers into thin strips.      Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat and add in the chopped onion. Cook until the onion browns about  minutes.      Add the garlic and cook stirring for about a minute and then add in the broth and tomatillos. Increase the heat to medium high and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.      Add the spinach and cook until wilted and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Mix in the sour cream lime juice and chicken and stir until well combined.      Preheat the oven to  degrees F.      Lay out the empanada discs and place a few tablespoons of filling on each round making sure to leave about  inch open on all sides to seal. Fold over the empanadas to make a half moon shape and pinch and fold the edges to seal much like you do with a pie crust.      Place the empanadas on a parchmentlined baking sheet and brush the empanadas with the egg wash avoiding getting any of the wash on the sealed edges.      Bake for  minutes then turn the tray and bake for another  minutes. Remove once golden brown.      While the empanadas bake make the AvocadoJalapeno Dip.      Combine all of the ingredients in a food processor and pulse until smooth.      Serve the empanadas with the dip and enjoy!  ,FoodPorn,cha44bm,6,t5_2rd9v

995595,0,t1_chh65og,Last time I went at Grand Central they had the same crinkly fries but at other locations they have hand cut fries. Personally I didnt see much difference between their crinkly fries and the frozen crinkly fries I find at a lot of other burger places crinkly fries are still awesome though. They were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside but were still the same kind as bulk frozen crinkly fries. Their hand cut fries are much better than InnOut in my opinion but not as good as a fresh batch of Five Guys cajun fries.It could just be due to variation in how long they had been out of the oil also but Ive never had a bad batch of fries at Five Guys since they cook them to order. Anyway our difference in opinion on fries could just come down to preference. Either way I now have a huge craving for Shake Shack that wont get satisfied until Austin opens up theirs and I can make the trip . Five Guys and InnOut and definitely not Whataburger just dont cut it anymore after I had a Shake Shack burger.,FoodPorn,chhgftn,1,t5_2rd9v

1948095,0,t1_cknxtzs,They arent used for texture. Theyre used for flavor. Specifically they are added to hot oil to flavor the oil with chili flavor. Chili oil is produced by adding warm oil to lots of ground up dried chili flakes to infuse the oil with chili heat and red color. Also scorched chili flavor is a key flavor in Sichuanese cooking and one of the defining flavors of the dish known as Kung Pao Chicken. Many people do not eat them at all just eating around them. Personally I like to eat them in a dish like this one because I think they taste great after being fried and I like the extra heat but other people think Im crazy.,FoodPorn,ckny5ms,4,t5_2rd9v

Tocino as commonly used in the Philippines often refers to meat which is processed to be sweetsavoury. The most popular and common form of Tocino here is made with pork belly rump butt. You can also find chicken variants of Tocino in markets.Not related to food or anything but I just thought Id share another Filipino language quirk Salvage which is typically associated as a positive term save has a negative connotation here it means to kill someone eg A policeman was salvaged by local rebels. It stems from a confusion with a Spanish term savaje Savage which is adopted as salbahe which again means save in Spanish iirc so most to Filipinos Salvage  salbahe  savage,FoodPorn,cmlrh3q,8,t5_2rd9v

2682583,0,t3_2qr7j5,Sorry about the picture quality! I was too hungry to worry about it. I followed Gordon Ramsays recipe with a few tweaks. I added a shallot to the duxelles and also refrigerated the wrapped wellington sans pastry for about  hours instead of his recommended  minutes. I think the colder the it is before wrapping in pastry the better because you dont want a warmish wellington melting the butter in the pastry  it will get greasysoggy. Let me know if you have any questions.,FoodPorn,cn8qfk1,7,t5_2rd9v

I was thinking shaved serrano chiles next time and a little more acid probably add some lemon juice to the pesto and finish with lemon zest. May want some more color pop so I might add in some tomato concasse or sundried. The costco brand pesto is seriously so good very bright fresh basil notes and real parmesan might have been the pesto you used. ,FoodPorn,cs6oh3a,2,t5_2rd9v

This was not so much a recipe as it was using what was fresh and at hand. The pasta was Alder NYC inspired but just replacing half of the flour in a regular pasta dough with fine rye. Maitake mushrooms were pulled into strips then fried with garlic and braised with stock and scallions. We were given six Asian eggplants that were roasted with a little oil and seasoning then skinned and blended with basil and walnuts. Plating such long sheets was interesting and I just folded back and forth alternating puree and ragout. ,FoodPorn,cu95y83,2,t5_2rd9v

It looks pretty convincing and looks like the animal products that would be used but there are no animal products or byproducts in it. It just seems very obnoxious to list everything with vegan or plantbased before it as its not how I or other vegansvegetarians talk in their usual everyday life.People also dont say animal in front of everything they say or say cows cheese with pigs bacon when describing their breakfast in the same fashion people dont say Im having gluten free cookies with some lactose free milk. They would probably just say theyre having cookies or milk.People will say you cant rightly call it what it is. Its just made differently. Different potatoes make different fries but theyre just fries. No one says they cant call one of them fries. People with severe dairy allergies eat plantbased cheese and if they called it cheese no one would bat an eye. No one would tell them to call it faux cheese.All I am saying is I think I can pretty rightly call it a crab cake. It looks feels and tastes just like crab. It and the animal version are interchangeable. ,FoodPorn,cuu95r3,-2,t5_2rd9v

The blog post has lots of pics and a printable recipe and also the recipe for the Salted Caramel Sauce that goes on top.Serves IngredientsButter for greasing pan cups allpurpose flour plus more for dusting pan cup vegetable oil cup sour cream room temperature cup granulated sugar cup brown sugar packed eggs room temperature teaspoon salt teaspoon cinnamon teaspoon baking soda teaspoon vanilla cups apples preferably tart like Honeycrisp or Granny Smith peeled cored and chopped into   inch chunks cup pecans or walnuts roughly chopped  cup toffee or butterscotch chipsSalted Caramel Sauce for drizzling optionalVanilla ice cream Creme Fraiche or whipped cream optionalMethod Preheat oven to F. Butter and flour a inch tube pan. Beat the oil sour cream and sugars together in a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment for about  minutes. Add eggs one at a time beating each until creamy. Add vanilla and beat for anther minute.In a medium bowl add the flour and cinnamon salt and baking soda and whisk to combine. Add to the wet ingredients beating on low speed just until combined. With a rubber spatula fold in apples and nuts and toffee chips until they are dispersed evenly. Dont overmix. Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan.

5257155,0,t1_cvjcfxo,Text recipe  Heres what youll need for about  pinwheels large chicken breasts or one whole rotisserie chicken shredded see note below cup hot sauce of choice I recommend Franks tsp cayenne pepper optional cup crumbled bleu cheese or shredded cheddar if youre not a fan of the blue stuff green onions large clove garlic Tbsp cream cheese packages of crescent rolls look for the ones without seams  specifically for recipes. Start by shredding the chicken and tossing it with the hot sauce and cayenne if using. This time around I poached two large chicken breasts in chicken stock then shredded them up with two forks. That being said the purpose of this type of food is to be easy so grabbing a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shredding it up at home is a great option as well. I like to let the hot sauce sit with the shredded chicken for at least a few hours sometimes overnight.. Preheat the oven to  degrees. Crumble the bleu cheese slice up the green onions and chop the garlic. Mix everything in with the chicken.. Add the cream cheese and mix it in with the chicken as well.. Pop open your first crescent roll tube and plop it onto the counter or a cutting board. You really want to the dough that is made specifically for recipes since it doesnt have the precut seems running throughout. If you cant find it just use your fingers to crimp together each seam. I add a little flour and use a rolling pin to make sure it comes out as one cohesive sheet of dough.. Spread out half your chicken mixture over the dough. You can go pretty much all the way to the edge on the sides but keep at least half an inch of dough exposed on the top and bottom of your rectangle.. Starting from the bottom carefully roll the dough into a tight log. Its not as hard as it sounds once you tuck in that bottom inch of dough it easily rolls into a pinwheel around the chicken. Finish with the seam side down.. Cut the log into   inch sections. Then flip them upright flatten them a bit if your knifeaction squished them and place them into a baking dish sprayed with nonstick spray. Repeat with the second tube of dough and the rest of the chicken mixture. Put them into the oven for about  minutes. You want the dough to be nice and golden brown with signs of bubbling and deliciousness happening in the filling.. Garnish with additional green onion if desired serve with ranch or bleu cheese dressing for dipping. ,FoodPorn,cvjobid,10,t5_2rd9v

5617169,0,t1_cwt2tsz,Depends on the person. Some people vehemently swear by rare beef but Id rather have a slowcooked or braised roast. To me rare beef has a disgusting metallic taste that is on par with sucking on a fistful of pennies. Slowcooking gets rid of that and allows you to use cheaper more flavorful cuts like chuck or round. Theyre much tougher than your average steak but  hours of lowtemp cooking will make them more tender than rare beef which is soft but still chewy.,FoodPorn,cwtd4br,2,t5_2rd9v

6273915,0,t3_41fwkt,This reminds me of the bread they served at a place in Wisconsin called Stewps. It was a place that did soups and stews and every soup order came with a literal  loaf of bread. Theyd just take one of those boules and cut it in quarters. If a family of  or  ordered theyd just throw in the whole loaf. They baked the bread fresh all day. You could buy their day old stuff for  cents to a buck depending on how much you were buying. It was the best stuff. Super soft fluffy inside and nice crunchy crust.

6292431,0,t1_cz4oqhb,Well I cant tell you the exact measurements I used because I just kinda play it by ear but heres a rough estimate   .lb deboned salmon fillet skin removed and cut into small cubes  cup finely chopped cilantro  tablespoons finely grated ginger root  cloves of garlic finely minced  green onions finely sliced  tablespoons Japanese soy sauce  tablespoon toasted sesame seeds  teaspoon toasted sesame oil Juice of  lime wedge   egg whiteCombine all the ingredients and form into small balls. Arrange on a baking sheet or cutting board covered in wax or parchment paper. Refrigerate and allow to set for half an hour.Pan fry in a little oil. Preheat your pan and oil on maximum heat til you see a wisp of white smoke appear from the oil. Place two or three cakes in the pan and reduce the heat to medium high I set mine to  out of  and sear for two minutes on each side. I like them to be a little rare in the center but thats up to you. Do  minutes for fully cooked.These are very richly flavoured umami from the salmon and soy pungent ginger and garlic nutty sesame. As such it really needs this spicy mango slaw to cut the richness to create a more balanced flavour profileSpicy Mango Slaw  mango peeled pitted and julienned  tablespoon finely chopped cilantro  large clove of garlic finely chopped White and light green part of  green onion finely sliced Juice of  lime Glug of olive oil Sriracha to your tasteCombine and set aside. Benefits from a bit of resting so make this first or while your salmon cakes are setting in the fridgeIf you want the complete meal I usually serve it with a light salad made with Israeli couscous or Orzo. Just boil the orzocouscous and when its cooled off toss with cilantro quartered cherry tomatoes cubed feta a few cloves of finely minced garlic lime juice olive oil salt and pepper. Just use your best judgement and adjust the seasonings as you see fit. Orzo and Couscous are like a vortex of flavour Ive sat there for  minutes adjusting the lime and other seasonings before I felt satisfied but be careful because the flavours become stronger as it sits. ,FoodPorn,cz4vn7b,1,t5_2rd9v

Do not insert sticks at this point. Allow puree to set for only a few minutes landing the timing takes trial and error to get a rhythm then pull from cooling source and pour out the unfrozen puree in the molds  leaving just an outer shell. Finally pour in the center flavor add sticks and freeze the rest of the way.Next time I want to try a Vanilla pop exterior with a molten chocolate filling ,FoodPorn,czqowk2,2,t5_2rd9v

Or old stores and warehouses that used to ship furniture and gifts to their family members back in Ireland that were actually full of concealed bullets guns or stuff like that that just attract republican supporters noe and then.

6972026,0,t1_d16lq13,You can definitely sous vide meats for too long. Its continually breaking down the proteins making the meat more tender which is something you can absolutely use for cheaper cuts of meat. But at some point you cross over to a kind of tenderness where all structure in the meat has disappeared and what youre eating feels more like a pate than a piece of meat. There are optimal time windows with sous vide but its obviously a hell of a lot more forgiving than the traditional methods. ,FoodPorn,d16m79q,4,t5_2rd9v

8767293,0,t1_d71jvsv,The mozzarella cheese used in sting cheese is nothing like the mozzarella you find in Italy. And mozzarella being an Italian cheese which is not proceeded much if at all. I think it is safe to say that the highly processed mozzarella derivative that string cheese is made of which I have not ever encountered out of the United States is American version of the Italian cheese. Many other classic foreign  foods abalone in the is have been changed significantly see pizza. The difference between the example you gave and mozzarella is that in this case the product is different to classic Italian mozzarella in which in this case is a fresh almost nonprocessed vs a highly processed which I believe share very little in common. ,FoodPorn,d71kpfl,-27,t5_2rd9v

9714354,0,t1_daaequh,If I may make a suggestion or two. Remove your sausage dont add the flour.  Gently sautee some diced opinion until softened and lightly browned. Add about two pinches of kosher salt. You can use table salt but its not as easy to cook with and doesnt taste as good as kosher salt. Kosher salt is great. Its cheap maybe box at most but it goes a long way and never expires. Lasts forever too. Easier to pick up with your fingers. Easier to eyeball. Has a nice crunchy texture when served on top of things. Cheap. Readily available. Add some fresh sage if you have it. If not thyme or parsley work. Just be careful with sage and thyme as a little goes a long way. You can always add more you cant take any out. Add enough butter to ensure the onions are moist.Add enough flour to just barely absorb all the butter. Gently cook on med low for about  minutes. Add milk slowly at first and fully incorporate into the flour before adding more. Start about  cup at a time. After about two of those start adding a little faster. Helps to ensure fewer lumps. Increase heat to med to med high and stir regularly until it comes to a simmer. Failure to stir regularly will result in burned gravy. Add sausage back to gravy and add milk if necessary. Remember it will thicken considerably upon removal from the heat so you want it to be just thick enough that it coats the back of a spoon and leaves a path if you run your finger across the back of the spoon. Adjust salt to taste. Make sure to undersalt it at this point because you will notice the salt more as it cools and the salt fully incorporates. Add freshly cracked black pepper to taste. While you can add those pencil shavings that come in a tin rectangle I urge you to get a pepper grinder and grind some peppercorns. This and the kosher salt are two of the best ways to get a big jump in the taste of your food without doing anything different. And theyre both cheap and readily available. Take off heat ladle over anything you can think of. Fresh buttermilk biscuits savory not British are always a good pairing. Fried chicken or steak. Mashed potatoes. Dressing. Any roast fowl. Game. A savory waffle. Hash brownsfried potatoes. The skys the limit. ,FoodPorn,daai6ap,2,t5_2rd9v

10275054,0,t3_5n5cnh,Heres the recipe from INGREDIENTS   sturdy Italian loaf or French baguette   ounces cream cheese softened at room temperature   cups shredded mozzarella cheese   cup pizza sauce plus more to serve   cup parmesan cheese plus more to top   tablespoon fresh basil chopped plus more to top   teaspoon dried oregano   ounces about  cup thick pepperoni slices chopped divided   tablespoons butter melted   cloves garlic minced  Crushed red pepper flakes optional to top  DIRECTIONSPreheat the oven to  F.  Cut the loaf into  equalsized pieces. Use a long knife to remove the insides keeping some bread along the edges. Pull out the loose bread to leave hollow bread quarters. Set aside.  In a large bowl mix together the cream cheese mozzarella cheese pizza sauce parmesan basil dried oregano and  cup of the chopped pepperoni. Mix well to combine.  Stuff the baguette quarters with the pizza dip mixture using a spoon to help pack the dip in.  Once the bread is stuffed transfer it to a cutting board. Line up the quarters so that they fit together as they did before the loaf was cut. Slice the bread into pieces that are approximately  thick.Tear a piece of heavy duty foil that is about  inches longer than the loaf. Slide the loaf slices off of the cutting board and onto the foil keeping them together.  In a small bowl combine the butter and minced garlic. Loosely cover the top and microwave for a minute or until the butter is fully melted. Brush the garlic butter over the baguette allowing some to drip down between the slices. Make sure to get all of the minced garlic on top of the bread. Top with the remaining pepperoni and sprinkle with additional parmesan cheese.  Wrap the foil around the bread and bake for  minutes. Unwrap the bread and bake for  minutes or until the top browns slightly.  Remove from the oven sprinkle with crushed red pepper flakes and basil and serve with pizza sauce for dipping.  xposted from rmorganeisenberg,FoodPorn,dc8qece,185,t5_2rd9v

If I even suggest that that magic amount has been surpassed everyone doubles down and suggests that bulldozer of onions needs to be dumped onto the plate to really be enough.Realistically though even if you like a buttload on your sandwiches you still want the onions properly cooked like you say and then mixed into the steak.

Minced meat however is ground animal flesh. Whatever you call mincemeat pies is not the same as mince pies although during the Tudor era it was.

11704286,0,t1_dgm99g2,Relating to your second comment Latin American horchata isnt made with chufa its made with other ingredients. For example Mexican horchata is made with rice and cinnamon and optionally vanilla  That being said its very common in Texas in any of our cities where we have a lot of MexicanAmericans and immigrants such as San Antonio Austin Houston or El Paso. I can go to any Mexican restaurant here in Dallas and get horchata. I can get it at most TexMex places and even some restaurants that dont specialize in Mexican or TexMex.
