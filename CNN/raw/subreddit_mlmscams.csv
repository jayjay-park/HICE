If you have a good product that has a large demand in a market with low supply and are charismatic and motivated enough then it is likely youll be successful with direct sales. Shitty MLMs usually market products that the market is already extremely over saturated with and that there is a low demand for. Of course they arent really selling the product theyre selling the proposition of easy money which is always in high demand and in turn making a profit off of individuals who want nothing more than to work hard and make an honest wage.,mlmscams,cel2pn4,3,t5_2zecf
