5633283,0,t3_3s8c97,Ive been trying Fedora in my vm and I have to say Im really impressed by it. Its really nice. Apart from GNOME I also tried LXDE and XFCE but I didnt really like those. Im not exactly a fan of GNOME but here I really like it and I have to say e been thinking if I should perhaps use it as my main system. Its as you say its very easy to control it from the command line. The dnf is very easy just switch apt for dnf and done. Really tempted to switch it for my Mint.Great review Chris! ,ChrisWereDigital,cwvd1od,1,t5_39xzb
5843992,0,t3_3v9g3m,NIce video!I did once try Privacy Badger but it crashed my Firefox and it wouldnt load anymore. Had to delete everything and start from the beginning. So Im careful about itBut I do use some others you mentioned. I like my privacy. And I really dont get people who dont care if their lives are public or not.,ChrisWereDigital,cxlo9nc,1,t5_39xzb
