8956598,0,t3_51ns2u,Shh dont tell anyone I gave you this link... This is from the graphics course I used to TA for. He doesnt focus on shaders much until semester  so scroll down to the Advanced Computer Graphics section at the bottom and choose the most recent one.The very first topic is procedural textures so exactly what youre interested in. Handouts contains the lecture slides which are very useful and Example Programs has source code.Just keep in mind that youll want to skip over all of the OpenGL and Vertex Shader stuff since Shadron does that for you. Fragment pixel shaders are pretty much the only thing youll be working with.,Shadron,d7og64u,2,t5_3elff
