3691474,0,t3_32loew,I inquired about this when I was in Tanzania but I never went through with it. I was told that its easy enough to hitch a ride from the Ugandan railway authority forget what theyre actually called if youre going Uganda gt Tanzania. I presume the trip should also be possible in reverse. As always Id expect to have to grease some palms.,tanzania,cqd1vrv,1,t5_2rhfq

I just jump right into your questions.You have to travel by car to get to Morogoro from Dar es Salaam.  There is no airport in Morogoro.  A a public bus is about TZS  and a taxi is about TZS .  Hotels are all around Morogoro.  I havent been there in a couple of years  I live in a different part of the country   but New Acropol is one that comes to mindThere are also cheaper hotels and guest houses available around town that can run as little as TZS  per night.  It just depends what your budget is.There are Barclays banks in Morogoro so you shouldnt have a problem pulling out TZS using a debit card from your bank or credit union.  Just be aware of the potential surcharges  I pay about USD . per withdrawal of TZS .  There are four big telecoms in Tanzania Airtel Tigo Vodocom and Zantel.  You will probably find good g coverage in town for all of these telecoms but I would recommend either Tigo or Vodocom for Morogoro.  These two networks also have great coverage around Tanzania.  Sim cards are available from either street vendors or from the offices of the telecom companies.  I think a sim card is about TZS  or .  In order to purchase your sim card you will have to register with a photo id  a passport works fine.  I would recommend purchasing your first sim card from the office of the telecom because they will be able to provide you with the apn for internet a g dongle as well as the available MbGb packages that they offer.  You are going to want to join a MbGb package before turning on g.  If you just pay by the shilling you will lose money FAST.  Ask them what packages they have available pick that one that suits you and join it.  For example I use Zantel they have decentpoor coverage in Morogoro and I pay TZS  per day for Mb of internet.  I also have a dongle that I pay TZS  for Gb per month.  I have an ASUS g travel router that I connect my dongle to for wifi in my house.  It works great and I love it.  You may or may not want to pickup a g router to bring with you if you want your own wifi access.  Each telecom has their own offers available but theyre all pretty comparable.The hard part of Swahili is learning the noun classes kivi mwa lima nn un mmi etc.  The verb conjugation is also a bit of a mouthful  one word can be an entire sentence.  But once you learn the rules of constructing sentences there are essentially no exceptions.  If youre really interested in learning the language try to get out and talk to people at least once a day even if you dont want to.  Let me know if you have any other questions.,tanzania,cr8rn5x,3,t5_2rhfq
