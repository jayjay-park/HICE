1150003,0,t3_278xa3,West Beach is a good location but not if you need to get it done soon. The seaweed is thick with no end in sight.. If you need to get it done soon there are sections of shoreline on Boddecker Dr. that would work to mimic the beach also it faces east so you could catch the sunrise with no seaweed. You could also go to the small section of beach right next to the south jetty there is usually little to no seaweed right there to the left of the jetty.,galveston,chyzm63,3,t5_2riby

That said it does look like an awesome house. We stayed in one this year that sleeps  with a sister house attached by a catwalk that sleeps another .
