That same night at the end of the show Mick was throwing guitar pics to the crowd and a fan fell over the barricade between the fans and the stage. The security guard started pushing the fan around instead of helping him get back over the barricade. Chris ran across the stage and started kicking the security guard in the back of the head. When the guard turned around Chris started wagging his finger in his face. The guard stopped pushing the fan around and helped him back over the barricade.Favorite song is probably surfacing or vendetta.,Slipknot,ckmaqk9,3,t5_2s7bp
1972205,0,t3_2habfy,I think Coreys masks have always been more selfreflective than the masks of the other people. His first mask had his own hair embedded into it.

2090519,0,t1_cl5jlwb,I like to separate their songs into one that would be played on radio AKA the lighter songs and then there heavier songs which not many people like due to the lack of change and chorus for me I think AOV is a great song because the song changes a lot and the chorus totally fits which doesnt make it less heavy. Songs like Nomadic remind me of My Plague which is one of my lesser favourite songs in Iowa while still very playable it feels like the chorus throws off the whole song.,Slipknot,cl5juh0,1,t5_2s7bp

It also talks about the other bands he was in.  It also comes with a tabbook with some Slipknot and Stone Sour songs and the nd half of the DVD is Jim explaining how to play the songs.  I didnt really watch that part because I figured it out just from reading the tab.  It also comes with an awesome Root signature pick with his signature on it.  Unfortunately I used the pick and rubbed the signature off. Theres a sticker too.   ,Slipknot,cn4ak90,2,t5_2s7bp

7658060,0,t1_d3bn9lt,You should do some more instrumental remixes for sure! I really thoroughly enjoyed this. Particularly Iowa that album just has some of the heaviest most creative shit theyve ever done. Would LOVE to hear some instrumental beefedup heavy af remixes from that album from ya great way to practice  get your chops up particularly The Shape or Disasterpieces. I find the older I get the less Im into the lyrics  vocal delivery but the music is as strong as ever. Also instrumental hecticheavy versions of some of the shit on All Hope Is Gone would sick as hell. If you do lemme know  post em here. Either way good work mang.,Slipknot,d3cofim,0,t5_2s7bp

Vendetta was in second last time I checked and it has  votes so Sulfur got quite a few in just an hour.Also rBabymetal had the same thing happening during their survivor where one song would get  votes out of no where usually to just barely take the lead. I didnt think strawpoll was that easy to manipulate though. I really dont understand why anyone would do that either...,Slipknot,dav6jcs,2,t5_2s7bp

10340343,0,t1_dcfh2kx,Thats true but one of the points he makes in the video is that Slipknots first albums were all about sending out rage and hate through their heavy music but their newer albums fail to do that as they have more of a sad theme rather than an angry theme which is why he started listening to heavier and more aggressive bands.,Slipknot,dcg4xly,1,t5_2s7bp

10763186,0,t3_5tz47f,Statistically speaking theres quite likely to be a better performance by the band. Theres probably recordings of less than  of Slipknots concerts out there which makes the existence of a better perfomance quite likely as this one is the best of that  available. Not every show gets recorded which makes the chances youll find it quite low. ,Slipknot,ddq55pm,5,t5_2s7bp
