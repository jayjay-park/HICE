5684752,0,t1_cwx26zz, If thats truly the case i have to wonder why we choose to come back to living in physical bodies. To be totally honest it feels like i should never have been born human.,spiritscience,cx1qyf2,1,t5_2utzn
5791993,0,t3_3uh1v0,Are you a very opinionated person and someone who talks a lot? Or tend to always give your opinions and interrupt people? IF that is the case it is possible that there has been a shift within you that is opening or closing? certain chakras.    It is possible you hare having those problems in your throat area because you are a vocal person and this is a physical sign of it fading away from your personality. It means you are going through an awakening. If you feel it then you are. Simple as.    Does that make sense? My mind does tend to go a bit out there I guess DEdit Typo,spiritscience,cxf1v6o,2,t5_2utzn
5812480,0,t3_3u0ate,I have found this to be very difficult being someone who is a bit younger as well. Many individuals are just not open to these concepts even though there is a lot of evidence that points towards a spiritual aspect. The best thing I have found is to understand that everyone is going to have their own point of view. There is no need to try to change their viewpoint just try to lay out the facts as you have come to know them or from your personal experiences. If they try to argue their point of view just tell them that your respect their point of view. The worse thing is trying to have an argument with a friend about different theological points of view. Just live and let live when it comes to others beliefs. Just let them know you are open to talking about it with them if they would like to.,spiritscience,cxhlcq8,1,t5_2utzn

6387754,0,t1_cxpuweq,I hope this isnt to late but I can relate to your brother. When I started to first learn about this stuff  though not through spirit science I was very enthusiastic and I never hounded anyone but I was eager to not be alone with all this and when i got started it was hard to calm down because you despertly want people to wake upwe all want someone to resonate with.And if spirit science  was the first thing I was exposed to I might have been like your brother.but I started with meditation and some things I learned and maybe you can share with him because if he into spirit science Im sure he will respect meditation is that Id he wants to change the world he has to start with himself.tell him that he shouldnt be spreading fear he should be spreading love and for him to do so requires him to accept people unconditionally the way they are and to do that he has to accept himself truly.maybe ask him to pull back from spirit science and dive into eckhart tolleram dassand Don Miguel ruiz.it is all intertwined but it kinda brings it back down to earth.people wake up in thier own time.peace and props to you for caring in a way that isnt judgemental but empathetic .,spiritscience,czfpz2y,1,t5_2utzn

11034266,0,t1_deipbol,I cant answer for him. But I can for me. That the truth is always within me.  Now slowly Im bringing it out.  Used to not be aware to spirituality AT ALL.  Doesnt mean I didnt have a soul the entire time.  So in a sense we all know know the truth deep down its just a matter of revealing it to ourselves as in becoming conscious of it ,spiritscience,deipjcs,1,t5_2utzn
