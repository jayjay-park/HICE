1534647,0,t1_ciyj009,So I install xen on my arch gave it mb ram as described on the arch wikiwiki says mb but I went higher to try.So after a reboot the xen kernel boots and I essentially get my same arch system with mb ram. if I choose the arch kernel I get the same system with all of my system ram that is  gig.So can you explain what this functionality is?I tried to give all the memory to the xen kernel and then make grub config again but this leads to kernel panic and xen wont boot.So how much memory should I assign to xen kernel ?The problem is if I give my xen kernel less ram the system runs with a heavy load and swapping takes place too. Since I have plex sabnzbd etc running.Sorry about the lengthy post. ,xen,cj8n71f,0,t5_2rv69
