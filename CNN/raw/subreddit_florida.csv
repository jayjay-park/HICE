I run a store where I make hiring decisions about how big my staff should be and let me tell you if minimum wage gets that high i guarantee my company will NOT allow me a proportional payroll increase. New minimum wage will not increase the amount of money that corporations want to spend. I will have the same amount of people or less doing the same amount of work but in less time. My minimum wage earners will be scheduled less hours putting more pressure on the supervisors  who will probably not receive proportional raises either to produce the same results with less help. ,florida,ceoh8g3,0,t5_2qh7q

However our countrys dirty past still lives today whether people want to admit it or not. gtwe have unfortunately in the black community embraced a thug culture foul language shooting cops abusing womenWho is we? He cannot include himself in that we because he is not part of the black community. Neither do I think that the black community has embraced the thuglike behavior of some of the members of their community. I am white but I have  black adopted siblings and I have lived within what you would call a black community for  years. The socalled thugs that I have encountered crime is going up again in my area so I am encountering people sadly mostly young boys and men who would be labeled as that much more often than recent years are not encouraged by the majority of the community the majority being black Americans. That type of behavior is highly looked down upon.To understand what the word thug really means I simply looked it up on the internetgtthug . a cruel or vicious ruffian robber or murderer. . a tough and violent man especially a criminalYet he goes on to describe thuggish behavior as things such as foul languageshooting copsabusing women I wont cover that because that seems to be outside of what the topic is which is race. We all use foul language well at least most of us FUCKING do. So far in  in Florida one cop has been killed by being shot on the job Officer Jared Forsyth may he rest in peace. However it was an accident during a firearms training session when the firearm went off by mistake. In Florida since the beginning of  data is updated up to April th   black males  latino males  white males  males whose races were unidentified have been shot by police. These are all case by case things I do not have the time right now to check each article to see if the killings were acceptable based on the situations. However lets say that all  deaths of these men were justifiable. For them to be justifiable they would have most likely been violent threatening criminals. A thug by one definition a tough and violent man especially a criminal. The killing of black men and white men not including the latinos or the ones whose races were not identified by cops are even in score  to . So wouldnt that mean that those white men are also thugs? I find his word choice to be extremely insensitive and just simply silly. The black community does not support thugs nor does the white community support thugs. Only thugs support thugs. So for him to say things of that nature its all simply outlandish. He then talks of blacks hurting whites and asks where the outrage is about that is. Check out this chart from the FBIs  records of the races of the victims offenders as well as the sex of the offenders which I again will avoid discussing because this talk is about race and I really need to go to bed.  number of whites murdered in   victims number of whites who murdered whites in   offenders number of blacks who murdered whites in   offenders number of blacks murdered in   victims number of blacks who murdered blacks in   offenders number of whites who murdered blacks in   offendersSo more whites in  were murdered. Around  of those killings were by fellow whites. As for the blacks about  of blacks murdered were murdered by fellow blacks. Around  of killings of whites were by blacks and about  of killings of blacks were by whites. So yes blacks are well in  killing more whites than whites are killing blacks. As far as killing one anothers races there is only a difference of  in which the black on black crime is higher than white on white.   black offenders and  white offenders in total only a  person difference. This is only from one source and Im sure there are more updated ones. My point is that people are killing people whites as well as blacks without too much of a number difference in total offenders. This man needs to just choose better words and do more fact checking before he speaks. The thug thing is really the only thing that bothers me.

6485960,0,t1_czq6icr,Im guessing youve never had someone commit suicide. It sucks. Especially when it happens for short term problems or when they have decided to get help for a mental disorder.And this fight is about a very real problem of suicidal people committing suicide after getting help for depression. Antidepressant medication causes a change in behavior which can increase the ability to commit suicide as the body and mind deal with the change in body chemistry. This means that people who dont really want to commit suicide will be more likely to actually commit suicide. This isnt about keeping people from having the ability to control end of life decisions but about ensuring that they are making that decision while they are lucid. Depression keeps lucidity at bay. Having the ability of a doctor to give advice and care to their patients is the goal. What you are pushing is the idea that doctors cant recommend that their patients stop eating cheeseburgers to prevent heart disease or diabetes. Sure they have the right to eat whatever they want but their doctor should be able to give medical advice. Proper eating is proper advice. Removal of dangerous items is proper advice. ,florida,czq72wx,5,t5_2qh7q
6535384,0,t1_czv94tw,You have the family coming in for a Holiday Dinner and you want to make sure you leave a lasting impression on them when they come over. You have a great looking Granite counter top that you had installed years ago but yet you feel that something is missing. Your Granite counter top has lost some its glossiness from over the years and it might be about that time to shine it up a bit. Do not worry and welcome to this list I composed of some of the best ways to clean or shine up your Granite counter top for when that time comes when you have to have guests over and you wish to leave them in awe at the beauty of your kitchen. After all you did spend money to have a spectacular kitchen. Now remember to be careful at all times about what you apply to your countertop and please do this at your own risk especially if it is a homemade remedy.Always remember a few basic rules like try to avoid any cleaning solution whether homemade or store bought that contains acid or is too acidic. Some things that come to my mind would be more like Lemon and Vinegar based solutions. Also avoid try to avoid harsh cleaners that may contain bleach or perhaps ammonia. Your main friend here is the sealant and you want to make sure your sealant is up to date to avoid your countertop absorbing liquids. So you are best to avoid cleaners that can harm the sealant of the Granite.     Here are some of simplest ways to clean and shine up your granite countertop and help restore some of that shine.. Over the counter products  One of the simplest ways to spruce up your countertop is to go to a store like home depot and purchase products created for that specific purpose. We do caution however that you read and follow the directions on the label or packaging to avoid any issues.. Natural or homemade remedies  Using a microfiber cloth and wiping down the surface good is a good way. Some people say that if you mix half a cup of water and half a cup of rubbing alcohol it makes a great cleaning solution. For a lot of folks usually this does the trick. Just be careful that whatever you apply is not going to damage the sealant.. Stay on schedule  Exercising regular maintenance usually does the trick. Like a car that needs an oil change regularly you should always remember to do maintenance ever so often. However this is a practice that you must never go long periods without. Regularly maintaining your countertop and making sure that nothing too harsh is coming in contact with the surface is the best way to prolong the life of your sealant and help keep and prolong that shine.. Hire a professional  There are professionals out there that you can hire to do occasional maintenance on your countertop or reapply sealant. If you do not have the time to this on your own then you can find someone who can. Some people say that staying on top of the cleaning of your countertop can actually reduce the wear and tear on it.. Regularly seal it   Making sure your countertop maintains the sealant is very important. Without the sealant liquids and oils can be absorbed. Make sure to never go too long without resealing it because over time this sealant can wear off. There are a lot of good article around the web that can show you how to apply this on your own. I caution that no matter which route you take that you be careful and try any solutions you attempt to do on your own at your own risk.One thing is for sure and that is with at least regular annual maintenance and making sure nothing damages the surface you should be able to prolong the shine life of your countertop.Thank you for reading this and if you have any other recommendations please feel free to comment below. If you are not to sure about how to maintain your Granite countertop please feel free to stop into our showroom in Orlando and one of our specialist will be more than happy to give you tips and assist you with almost anything granite.

7900071,0,t1_d43tdlj,I am going to respond to this but I am also going to include a response to your commentgtYes but reddit also freaks out if a  year old kid sends a dick pic and gets prosecuted so we better figure out the right answer.As the article talks about bullies and such so I am assuming she didnt consent. But I stand on the assertion that if you obtain nudesexually explicit photos or videos of someone under the age of  consensually then that is a very gray area.  However if the photosvideo are obtained without consent that falls under child pornography.   If you distribute those photosvideos regardless of consent you have distributed child pornography. I think thats a completely fair answer.To put it in a situationSarah and Ralph are dating Sarah is Ralph wants a dirty picture of Sarah so Sarah sends him lets him take a picture. This is a gray area depends on Ralphs age and other things but I feel its mostly harmless.Ralph takes the pictures of Sarah and forwards them to his buddy. Ralph is now distributing and creating child pornography.Lets say Sarah says no and Ralph uses some subterfuge I really like that word to get his picture of Sarah violence drugs alcohol spying hidden camera blackmail etc.  Ralph is immediately guilty of creating child pornography and if he shows anyone he is also guilty of distribution.  I guess my point is that if there was any bullying or any distribution that wasnt done by this girl they should be punished. ,florida,d441iw1,1,t5_2qh7q

8174137,0,t3_4r94q7,St. Augustine would be my pick. You can wind up with fairly private beaches but because of the historic area there is a ton to see and do when not at the beach. The conch house is more pricey but if its still around you should go for dinner. You can sit up in the air in basically raised gazebo picknick tables over looking the water. I have read numerous times for years the gypsy cab company is great for food but sadly of all the times I have been have yet to try it. Check out trip advisor for food ratings there is seriously a bunch. St. Augustine is by far one of my all time favorite  vacation spots. If you stay multiple days and are really interested in the historic side I would highly recommend the narrorated trolly tour parking can be a pain in the ass and the trolly has like  stops and runs all day plus it tells you a bunch of neat history and is usually a  or  day pass so it can end up being very convenient. Or try their ghost tour! I have done both a walking one and a trolly one they are the best and we do ALOT of ghost tours. The guides dress up and seem to really care about the history and acting side. My personal favorite place is Flagler college the architecture is just so worth the tour.

The unintended consequences of GMOs havent been studied very well look at the recent links to GMO pollen and bee health decline.That being said GMO mosquitos have nothing to do with GMO food so OP and you making that connection is ridiculous. I think GMO mosquitos are a godsend reducing populations with a genetic timebomb cant really have an impact on much.

8881845,0,t3_51tvrv,Every Florida resident should be aware of this!  Naled has been linked to microcephaly!  So spraying it in the air where We will breathe it in is going to cause the very thing We fear the most!  So based on outcome that would justify more spraying!I urge everyone to contact Your City County and State Officials to notify them of the controversy so that we are not so quick to kill most of the species in one of our trophic levels.  They are important to the entire food chain.  Not to mention the lost agriculture production due to reduced pollinator populations Bees and Butterflies and the added bonus of poisoning our families in the process with a neurotoxin!It isnt that hard to put on bug spray use mosquito netting or stay indoors If you are at risk of injuring your unborn child..  For everyone else the symptoms of the Zika Virus are very mild!  Like a flu.  WHO World Health Organization Zika Virus Factsheet  Ever wonder why there arent as many butterflies and bees anymore?  It is largely because of widespread use of pesticides particularly Neonicotinoids and mosquito spraying which also use Neonictonioid chemicals.As the article SNM posted mentions  Florida  sprayed these chemicals aerially over  millions acres in .  That was in  counties.This is a serious threat to our ecosystem!  Naled kills most aquatic life many insects including the predators of the mosquitoes thus making the problem worse in a multitude of ways!  It is also a neurotoxin to mammals including humans and causes respiratory problems.I feel like We as a nation are responding to Zika like We need to use a sledgehammer to fix the issue when really a feather duster amount of force by comparison would be much better overall!Ask this  Why do agricultural workers have to wait  days before reentering a field treated by naled but somehow it is OK to put it in the air over our homes while We sleep and get ready for work or school in the morning?  Anyone who is out early in the morning will be at risk of breathing it in.  Thats the last thing someone breathing deeply while exercising or working wants in their lungs!Check out this excerpt from CornellTOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTSACUTE TOXICITYNaled is moderately to highly toxic by ingestion inhalation and dermal adsorption. Vapors or fumes of naled are corrosive to the mucous membranes lining the mouth throat and lungs and inhalation may cause severe irritation . A sensation of tightness in the chest and coughing are commonly experienced after inhalation . As with all organophosphates naled is readily absorbed through the skin. Skin which has come in contact with this material should be washed immediately with soap and water and all contaminated clothing should be removed. Persons with respiratory ailments recent exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors impaired cholinesterase production or with liver malfunction may be at increased risk from exposure to naled. High environmental temperatures or exposure of naled to visible or UV light may enhance its toxicity.The organophosphate insecticides are cholinesterase inhibitors. They are highly toxic by all routes of exposure. When inhaled the first effects are usually respiratory and may include bloody or runny nose coughing chest discomfort difficult or short breath and wheezing due to constriction or excess fluid in the bronchial tubes. Skin contact with organophosphates may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Eye contact will cause pain bleeding tears pupil constriction and blurred vision. Following exposure by any route other systemic effects may begin within a few minutes or be delayed for up to  hours. These may include pallor nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal cramps headache dizziness eye pain blurred vision constriction or dilation of the eye pupils tears salivation sweating and confusion. Severe poisoning will affect the central nervous system producing incoordination slurred speech loss of reflexes weakness fatigue involuntary muscle contractions twitching tremors of the tongue or eyelids and eventually paralysis of the body extremities and the respiratory muscles. In severe cases there may also be involuntary defecation or urination psychosis irregular heart beats unconsciousness convulsions and coma. Death may be caused by respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. From TLDR?Zika is a minor threat poisoning our nation with neurotoxins is a VERY MAJOR threat.See also  EDIT Sources Formatting.,florida,d7fh0dl,1,t5_2qh7q

11163249,0,t3_5zde88,Thats a  hr drive time assuming youre trying to end up in the MiamiFt Lauderdale area since you mentioned Key West. Even if you dont stop at hotels to sleep youll need to stop for gas leg stretches food etc. Thats  hrs easily. Not even accounting for traffic or construction set backs. The first rd of your journey will be mostly mind numbingly boring desert. Hopefully your friendships are strong. General rule of thumb if youre  full on gas but see a gas station or gas station exit stop and fill up. You mentioned places to stop and rest. If your goal is to make it to Florida in that time frame you simply dont have time. By the time you get to southern Florida youll be exhausted. Also from MiamiFt Lauderdale a drive to Key West will be an additional  hrs at best case scenario. Let alone the traffic headaches of Southern Florida and a lot of Florida in general that will undoubtedly arise. Florida is a long vertical peninsula state extending out into the ocean and while certainly not as big as California I think out of staters can neglect to take into account the size of the state and driving times that incurs. And on top of that the drive to Key West while lovely and quite an experience can be quite a rage inducing headache at times. Any South Floridian will tell you horror stories of backups on the hundred mile stretch SINGLE LANE highway especially during holidays or peak hours. And its along thin islands the Keys and over the ocean. So you either turn around or keep going. No alternate routes. While I commend your ambition I might rethink the destination. Im assuming this is a spring break plan considering the timing? Both Miami and Key West are generally best for a  crowd. Again making some assumptions on your age you didnt provide that info That being said we do have beautiful beaches here in MiamiFt Lauderdale. But A LOT of Florida has beautiful beaches. Thats why people come to vacation here. Id suggest somewhere along the Gulf Coast side of Florida. Depending on your timing Panama City Beach is lovely and would shave several hours of your drive. That being said this is Northern Florida and may not be as warm as youre looking for depending on when you come. So check the weather forecasts. Theres also the option of Clearwater Beach. This is kinda the greater Tampa area. Again beautiful beaches. Admittedly these places arent as exciting or have the name recognition of other Florida destinations. But after the ambitious drive you plan on taking youll want to just chillout on a beach and relax anyways. At least for a day or . Hopefully this gives you some insight. ,florida,dexcc8s,1,t5_2qh7q

I dont know about your family but there arent any sexual offenders in my family nor his mothers family nor my current wifes family nor among our friends. Hes stood a much greater chance of running into someone willing to hurt him for his wallet or car than being diddled by some faceless pervert.I dont think these lists of sexual offenders are actually doing a thing for public safety. It might be nice to know but really these offenders are already well known to the local police. My knowing about them is doing little for my safety. But if were going to have lists honestly knowing about nearby violent criminals who have taken life or valuable property would do me a lot more good. Those are the people I want to keep an eye on.,florida,deyjksn,3,t5_2qh7q

11446599,0,t1_dftf8jo,Wow. Not in the same league at all. Allowing the death penalty does not mean its obligatory. State law says that prosecutors can seek the death penalty in cases at their own discretion. Theres no law that says prosecutors are required to seek the death penalty in criminal trials.,florida,dftgn4g,18,t5_2qh7q
