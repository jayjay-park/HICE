634184,0,t3_21dt4r,My Ex and Is marriage had been broken for quite a while. We definitely werent honest with each other or respectful. I put up with the physical and verbal abuse the affairs the lies.I really suspected when we went to couples counseling that she directed the sessions to be solely about me and my problems we never discussed hers. I was blaming myself for the problems of the marriage and she was AOK with me taking all the blame.I discovered her LiveJournal account that documented her affair with a coworker. It killed me to read dates and times for the things they did. While I had a  month bedconfining health problem she was busy blowing her coworker in the server room at work then coming home to tell me how worried shed been about me all day.I think what sealed it was during our second separation I came by the house and found someone elses brand of cigarettes in the ashtray. I confronted her on it and she just gave me the most pleased smile and didnt say anything. She was honestly happy I had found it and was crushed.We got divorced in January of . I was a complete wreck at the court date. To twist the knife I was walking out of the courthouse sobbing my eyes out. My Ex comes up to me and says Do you want to go get a drink and talk? You seem really upset.I had to learn a lot from that marriage. It was a giant size scoop of Suck but I figured I DESERVED all that that I wasnt worth being in a good relationship. I went to a lot of therapy sessions and got my head on straight.One thing that clinched it was my Ex and I started screwing around in . I was hoping wed get back together and she was just passing the time in between men. She announced at the end of the year that she was going on a date with some other guy. Finally my spine had grown back. I stood up and said Thats it. Im done with this. and walked out. She looked so pissed off that I stood up for myself. I felt great that I finally stood up for myself.I let myself turn into a doormat in that marriage. It wasnt all my exwifes fault I allowed myself to give up and not stand up for myself. Im in a MUCH better relationship now. My girlfriend and I are very honest and open with each other. We always talk things out. I think me becoming OK with being alone after the divorce allowed me figure out where my boundaries were and to keep them in one piece. Theres just some things I wont tolerate any more.

If he is called in for questioning the police will be able to see that you reported this and  know that this has happened before. I hesitate to mention this last point because it is an extreme scenario but I feel it must be said because it has happened before. If he comes after you in retribution for him getting kicked out of school. If he hurts you or worse... There will be a record of what happened and the police will know the first person to look at. Reporting it not only helps to protect you but also gives others who might dealing with him in the future the ammunition against him should the need arise. Your school obviously thought that there was enough evidence even if circumstantial that they believe your claim.

Im also working at a high school currently and if you think impending middle age is annoying on its own I assure you its only worse when youre surrounded by people who are on the very cusp of adulthood. To be fair its also a great place to gain perspective on how fucking awful it was to be that age so... yeah.But I remember feeling pretty much this same way at   and honestly after my s  seemed as looming a brick wall as  does right now. And yet my s have been mostly pretty great. So Im taking it on faith that my s will be brighter than they look from this side of them.And I feel you on the kids angle. Im not all torn up about not having any but it seems unfair that now that Im finally more or less ready Im already well on my way down the declining slope of my fertility. Human life span has been extended drastically and our metaphorical childhoods have extended along with it. And yet that biological imperative remains stubbornly stuck in place. Ive mostly gotten used to the idea that there arent any biological kids in my future but it still seems like a raw deal. I intend to vent my frustration at time by making dark jokes to my similarlyaged friends about kids these days and the many ways in which they suck and by taking every opportunity to irritate the younguns with my oldandinthewayness. Theres nothing I enjoy more these days then watching them get all worked up over shit and Im endlessly amused by the likelihood that prior generations were doing the same thing to me when I was a kid.

4580251,0,t3_3dqdcf, Ive been in the restaurant business since . Currently run  restaurants. I started as a dishwasher learned everything I could as fast as I could worked my way up and have had a great career. Ive seen people from every imaginable way of life come and go in this business for almost  years. Heres my conclusion Opportunities are still there as they always were for people who want to do the work and excel. The amount of people who want to do the work and excel are far far fewer than there used to be. Part of this problem is corporate America. Ive been fortunate enough to work for the same company for  years and they treat people very well and pay them above average compensation across the entire spectrum of job positions. Most companies do not WILL NOT do that anymore. Mostly because people will accept less money to do the job so they have no incentive to pay them a proper wage. Seriously the first time I made over k a year running restaurants in salary and bonus was . Holy shitballs there are practically NO companies that will pay a general manager HALF of that TWENTY YEARS LATER.  So why should people want to do the work for a job that pays shit?? rhetorical. Something needs to change in that equation and it isnt going to be corporations until they feel pressure to increase wages. Therefore it needs to be either people willing to do the work or it needs to be people not accepting a shitty wage to do a shitty job. Or maybe both or a combination of the . Either way it needs to be the people that change for the corporations to change. Now I look at the people we have in most of our restaurants I read young peoples comments on reddit and elsewhere talk with younger people at work talk with my kids who are early s and I think who are these people?. And most assuredly they are not the ones who are willing to go out and fight to change this. But yeah theyll be the first ones to tell you how they are online protesting for new rights like legalizing marijuana. Wheres the fucking logic in that??Slacktivism rules now. You dont have to go out and actually protest stuff anymore just change your Facebook profile pic and you did something. Thats the attitude of most kids I see these days. A lot of complaining and not a lot of doing. Sorry but we didnt like the world we grew up in so we went about changing it. Now all I see is a lot of complaining about how the older generation fucked it up for the younger one. Well that was the exact same way we felt. But we took care of it. Sorry you dont like it.

4817632,0,t1_cu1qxzv,What an interesting difference between those two articles.In OPs article we are told about the coddling of the American mind and how students are demanding protection from words and ideas they dont like.In the other article they seem to be introducing many ideas students dont like but with as you put it a warning label on it in case someone in the class has been traumatized by real life events mirroring the subject.Thats an enormous difference.I see no problem telling students todays topic deals with rape and incest. I think we have all in our every day lives had situations where bringing up such types of issues can backfire severely because you didnt know person X had been raped etc. We learn theres a time and place to discuss such topics and that not everyone has led a life without these things. Those kids who are beaten mercilessly by the parents for a couple of decades and survive will end up in your class. If youre going to discuss brutal family violence it might be wise to bring this up in the first session.But thats not protecting them from ideas they dont like. That notion conjures up images of students being given As for no work on subjects they disagree with or teachers having to not teach their subject because the students want to be molly coddled.However I get this in reference to serious issues like rape and abuse etc specifically in relation to PTSD. Emotional triggers for PTSD are real and can really suck for the sufferer beyond what people might expect if theyve never experienced it.But I have to believe only a tiny minority of students have PTSD. Obviously if they were veterans coming to school after their tours on the GI Bill I expect some degree of PTSD but for the remainder the vast bulk of students the incidences are probably quite low.So we have a twofold issue Trigger warnings if we must call them that are fine if we are talking about a professor addressing their course content on the first day or before a specific lecture. AND it seems like many students particularly a new wave of feminist are attributing PTSD symptomology to themselves when it is unwarranted. I havent figured that one out yet.But this notion that this constitutes molly coddling the american mind to protect if from ideas it doesnt like to me is rightwing reactionary propaganda making mountains out of molehills as usual.But when I delve deeper into this rabbit hole I cant help but laugh at what I find. If we decided to tell students that christianity might be harmful rather than helpful they are the first to protest citing the constitution and crying persecution. At no point to do they think they are asking to be molly coddled or that they are protecting students from ideas they dislike. Its much like the you are too PC debate the right likes so much. You have the right to be offended but you dont have the right to not be offended! they say and frankly theyre right. Pity they disinvited Trump for his nonPC comments about women because they were offended or how McCain demanded an apology for Trumps veteran comments. Seems they understand perfectly well when they are the ones offended. In the end I find all of the uproar over this to be hypermagnified as an ah ah I told you liberals were bad from the right and not really based in any substance at all.,RedditForGrownups,cu1svr4,2,t5_2sh93

Cocksure hes the smartest kid on the block. Clearly not the case. Unable to keep his conversations straight so he ends up looking like a clown. Doubles down when his error is pointed out. Preaches about being master of your own life but unable to nutup enough to apologize for his mistakes and rudeness. Preaches about being master of your own life but is clearly a slave to getting the last word which I will continue to exploit for ironic fun General allaround liar bullshitter and internet tough guy with a delusion that hes somehow qualified to preach to total strangers whom he knows nothing about but simply imagines how they live thier lives. Makes Jon Snow look briliantly insightful. Unable to understand that if someone wants to take an elective class that isnt offered in the first place or at least whenwhere they have access to take it that its NOT the end of the world at least not to an adult. Doesnt understand that moving on and trying again later are how adults deal with minor adversities like being unable to take an enrichment. Doesnt even seem to understand that adults have large responsibilities to their nonalleged families and jobs and that they may have good reasons for placing others needs in front of their own play time desires.

Her memory is imperfect and those flaws in her memory are clearly rewritten to help her deal with her grief.If the standard of knowledge is direct experience we can never know anything because time turns experience into memories and those memories are flawed. The problem with these identity politics is that they attempt to take away the power from others judgment. The truth is sometimes an outside perspective sees things more clearly than the person experiencing them.To negate my empathybased opinion an opinion earned from a similar experience to hers just because Im not a parent or a woman or white or not from Colorado etc. only limits the free exchange of knowledge and ultimately all of our collective ability to learn as a species.,RedditForGrownups,d01dpqx,-4,t5_2sh93

Walk down Bourbon St so you can say you did itthere will be jazz bands and rock bands along the way then cut down Esplanade to Frenchman St where the locals go for live music. There are about a dozen clubs there mostly with no cover that put on unreal shows practically every night.  Night life Friendly people. Tons of bars.

7092557,0,t1_d1j9o44,Most parents my age are pouring the money that could be used for their retirement into their childrens education.  College aged children asked to pay their own way through school are currently bitterly complaining that their parents are not funding their start in adult life well enough. So what is a parent to do  funnel money into their own retirement so their adult child doesnt resent them later or funnel money into their childs education so their young adult child has the best possible start and doesnt get saddled with debt? There are people on this very thread citing student loans as one reason they would resent caring for their parents the financial burden necessitating long hours at workless disposable income. So it seems like a no win for the parents here.   Also what possible preparation can a person do for their old age? What are we posting here right now doing to ensure our own childrens freedom from responsibility for us? If I stashed away a nice sum to retire on then yes I suppose Ill be financially able to hire a stranger to listen to me ramble about the s and share family stories wipe my butt feed me watch me die. If I stashed a huge sum of money I could maybe find that one in a million caregiver who will live in my home and help me stay in familiar territory once I lose everything else I recognize in life. Maybe. More likely Ill get one of the familiar stories of a series of caregivers who impersonally and perhaps irresponsibly babysit me for money show up if Im lucky not steal from me nor harm me through neglect if Im very lucky and when I cant make financial decisions for myself anymore my adult child will look at my bank balance and be asked to funnel that money  their inheritance  into the best possible old peoples home? Is that preparation?   I dont think theres any good way to prepare for nonfamily to care for you in your old age. Money and luck might get you safety and dignity maximum but it will still be a very lonely way to die. ,RedditForGrownups,d1kb6bj,1,t5_2sh93
7113766,0,t1_d1mp6s2,Yes she knows how unhappy I am with her moods. Over the years Ive had a lot of sit down heart to hearts about this. Usually I let things calm down after a bad day and when things are normal Ill sit her down and have a conversation. Before the kids I had one large conversation where I said look we are having major arguments over nothing every three weeks. I dont care who is to blame Im not pointing fingers it might be your fault my fault or nobodies but Im not going to live like this. If this keeps happening then were going to have to make a very tough decision here and were going to go through a lot of pain that neither of us wants but we will not be together anymore. That stopped the arguments for a while.Now we dont have blow up arguments every three weeks but there are definitely regular issues where I bite my tongue curl up into a ball and wait till it passes. Having the nuclear option discussion isnt something Ive done since we had children because I honestly dont know if I am serious about following that through. In many ways Id rather just curl up and take it sometimes and still have a family than break it up. I dont like it I dont like that she does it it makes me very upset but I dont want my children to suffer over something that I can deal with.Regarding domestic labour  thats an interesting one that it would be good to hear your opinion on. If you asked her she would say that she is shocked by how little I do and then she takes on an unfair share of the domestic work. If you asked me Id say that I work a full time job I have to leave the house before am and get back around pm in order to work to pay for the mortgage and our lives  thats pretty normal. She is a full time stay at home mother with the children in day care or with relatives three days out of the week. I do all my own domestic chores  wash and iron my clothes etc. She does the majority of the childcare although I bathe the kids when I get home every evening look after them whenever required at weekends. Cleaning the house we have agreed that we will do a big clean once a month and we agree that we should split that . I do all the things agreed in that  split vacuuming cleaning windows mirrors although every month we have the same conversation where she tells me that she feels I havent done my share and that she feels she has done more than me. I always say the same thing  Ive done everything we agreed on if theres anything else left just let me know and Ill do it and if you want to swap a task next month if you feel it will even it up no problem. So thats a tough one! Overall for the whole lot child care domestic chores she does more but as she is a full time stay at home mother and the children are either with relatives or in day care for three days out of the week and I literally am away at work most of the time and only have weekends I think its an insane discussion to have. Of course I cant do domestic chores or child care on a Tuesday when I am at work  but here you go. That is a common discussion we have. ,RedditForGrownups,d1mqoy6,3,t5_2sh93

Youll probably have all your old unsuccessful habits triggered and will have to make an effort to build new ones if you want to succeed with women.  And from the sound of your post youre likely to be thinking of yourself as an unsexable loser the whole time  that certainly wont help. PIts much much easier to become good with women when youre young than it is when youre older  that is absolutely true.  But its a skill that can be learned as an adult too.  I dont think language acquisition is a good metaphor but it could be for some aspects of it e.g. emotional acuity and various social skills may have comparable easy windows.But I think most of what makes it easy to get good with women when youre young is that everybody around you is going through the same developmental stages as you and youre all expected to be bad at it and stumble and to keep trying.  So theres this easy opportunity to gain a huge amount of experience very quickly which never repeats itself.So Id expect it to be fairly difficult but attainable with effort.

It took us  year from extraction to final tooth installation to get it all done so you could possibly start in the fall of one year to make use of the benefits over  years. That may help.

8895478,0,t1_d7gvexe,Just google some basic instructions and start. Its really simple. Close or half open your eyes sit straight and take slow and deep breaths and only focus on your breath. But you have to do and try it for at least a couple of sessions before you start to feel you know what youre doing. Perhaps enlist in a beginners course. I started a zen course. Its a pure and simple form of meditation without a lot of mumbo jumbo. And definitely buy a meditation cushion filled with kernels. You will be able to sit in the typical meditation position which greatly enhances the experience.After a while you will care less about your attitude and accept it and youll start to enjoy stuff a  little bit more. Also the rate of returns is simple the more you meditate the more benefit you receive. And as an added bonus youre intellect sharpens which will benefit your work. And your sleep will become more restful. The hardest part is keeping it a regular habit ideally after and before bed about  minutes. But dont let that frighten you. Just start with  minutes and keep that up. Slowly increase it over time.Good luck!,RedditForGrownups,d7h3y51,1,t5_2sh93

9034880,0,t1_d7xmwi5,Dont be unfair. The ideal is to not have a roommate for most people Im sure. That being said Ive known quite a few people who I admire and consider grown ups and they choose to have roommates because for them it makes sense financially. They could pay more to live alone now but choose to forego a level of privacy because theyre are shooting for financial independence at an earlier age than most. I say good for them. Not for me but I can still see that its a smart move. Not saying this is the case here just saying you never know the reasons for a situation so no sense in judging. As for the dog issues well OP should probably also state what shes done to address the situation with the dogs owner. In my experience dogs are usually destructive not only due to poor training but because theyre bored.

9996233,0,t3_5irq6n,I understand that this is probably not meant to be taken seriously but  for the fun of it lets think about this a little bit.The way I see it the inherent problem with this kind of metaphorical thinking and thinking that modern Western men are somehow domesticated and diminished compared to our ancestors in general is that were actually living in an age when its easier for an average Western man to do what they will than ever before. Want to have sex without marriage? Its possible. Want a divorce not to support your family or your aging parents from your wages? No problem. Want to not have children without your neighbours thinking youre queer? No big deal. Want to heaven forbid choose your own wife? You can! Pick up a hobby? There are endless possibilities and nobody is going to force you to give up unproductive pastimes like Reddit or computer games. Want to travel? The world is your oyster. Your rich neighbour wants to steal your stuff and bash your head in? You actually have a decent chance of getting justice. Want to go clubbing in your s? Nobodys going to judge you. Want to go hunting? The kings foresters wont hang you for the offence.None of these things were possible for the vast majority of men in the past. When you think about the past you seem to visualize a situation when every man was pretty much free to act like Genghis Khan. This has never been the case. For most of our species history the majority of men have been more or less forced to  bow and scrape and lick the boots of other men in order to maintain themselves and their family.  Think about it in the past the majority of men were servants bonded labour slaves seasonal workers farmers most might not even own their land or tradesmen. Very strict societal norms govern the behaviour of such people. In most historical class societies there was very little upward mobility or possibilities for improving your lot in life. Most people lived and died in the place they were born. Means of production were limited meaning that survival of the community was dependent on every member of it behaving in an expected manner. Vagrants antisocial people and deviants were heavily punished. Sure you could beat up your wife and children the only people you could treat like you wished but your community would still think youre a total bastard. Everybody would know what you get up to at home. The downside of having this power over your family was that you were expected to provide for them which means more bowing and scraping to sell your services or labour.And thats not even counting the moral and religious norms enforced by the society i.e. other men. So how far back would you say wed have to go before the majority of the men in any society were still wolves? I guess youre thinking of huntergatherers? It just so happens that the huntergatherer societies tend to have even stricter behavioral norms for male behaviour than agricultural ones because survival is a lot less certain. Imagine living with your parents and grandparents and elder aunts and your wifes parents and grandparents for your whole life... in the same tent or hut. Thats pretty much what itd be like. These societies often have complicated initiation rites for men and women to suborn them into the same societal norms as their parents. Being cast out of your tribe or clan pretty much meant death.So to go back to your idea.

10591167,0,t3_5rlrpp,No its really helpful for the most part.  There was a time when I was a big proponent of a multi party system but the reality is America is a winner take all system and the sharing of power between groups is a subtler affair than in other nations where all the groups on one side of the aisle might team up.  For one thing it allows votes to be for grabs in a better waydemocrats or republicans could have candidates that pull in moderate or libertarian or just independent support.  So candidates and party platforms can find a wide variety of ideas to support.  And if youre worried about getting stuff done just understand the two party system is the fast one and any other option would likely take even longer.  The thing about the political divide in the country is that the government is supposed to work for everybody.  Read Haidts The Richteous Mind for an analysis of why people believe the things they do. The important thing is the posthoc rationalization for beliefs that seem to be based much more around feelings than reason.

And in the great book of my familys genealogy that covers  there is a blurb on my great great grandfather who was a serial homesteader during the midtolate s. It reads as followsgt He was an Abolitionist before the Civil War and a Greenbacker after. Now everybody knows what Abolitionist is and the obviousness of their position. Few people know what a Greenbacker is. The Greenbackers were an early populist group who supported the radical idea that changes in the money supply should reflect economic growth rather than the arbitrary amounts of precious metal available at any given moment. This was not only the essentially correct position on monetary policy it was also the position that was in a debtladen homesteaders best interest. In contrast deflationary metalbacked currency was usually in the best interest of the rich.My point here is not to brag about my woke ancestor. Quite the opposite. My ancestor was an uneducated dirtfarmer from the ass end of nowhere. His birthplace is still the ass end of nowhere. Nevertheless that dirt farmer was engaged enough politically to be  years ahead of his time on monetary policy. No internet. Spotty access to the telegraph. Abysmally low literacy rate. And nevertheless somebody managed to reach out and organize a whole fucking generation of dirt farmers and get them on the same page with respect to fucking monetary policy. Here is my point A nation full of high school educated people with access to the internet has absolutely no excuse. None. Its not that people are dumb or uneducated in any kind of fundamental way. People were even dumber and less educated  years ago. The problem is that almost nobody is reaching out to the people. Dont believe me? Go to a local meeting of your Democratic Party. You wont get any meaningful discussion of why you should be a Democrat and how that ties into local political issues. All youll get is a bunch of Who wants to run for X? and What do we want to do for Candidate Y? and most prominently Why dont people know whats good for them?Well bc you dont fucking talk to them thats why. You dont talk. You dont ask. You dont listen. So of course theres no fucking connection between the Democratic Party and the people it is supposed to represent. ,RedditForGrownups,dd8qmpf,12,t5_2sh93

I didnt reconnect and have a healthy relationship with her until I was  four years ago.I can say all I needed then was acceptance love and time spent together that didnt involve watching shitty TV. I rebelled because I didnt feel any of those things and because of that I felt depressed hid my feelings and smokeddrankwas promiscuous then moved on to acid a couple times ecstasy and cocaine a LOT instability and dysfunction...What really helped for our relationship was while I was in treatment. I wrote her an honest letter telling her how I felt all the resentments and I read it to her face to face in front of a group. We talked honestly and cried. Maybe you could do this but have the family be the group. Thats just my two cents theres a lot of variables in any situation like this. But from my experience negative responses just make it more negative. I never stayed home when I was grounded I just rebelled more the more I was disciplined.
