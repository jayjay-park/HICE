6876170,0,t3_49wqir,Crystal Focus is on its . iteration and is the flagship card.  It is loud detailed  bit sound with a whole lot of customization options such as volume sensitivity duration storage for separate sound fonts colormixing capabilities room for several accent leds etc. etc. It can run bar graphs for power levels does gesture control comes with  sound fonts preinstalled with more you can add...  All the bells and whistles and they DO clang and sparkle.  My favorite card.Crystal Shard is in its . phase just added  bit capability itself. It is the little brother of the CF and can do almost everything the big brother can do only cheaper and with less of the frills fewer accent leds stuff like that. It too will store separate sound fonts up to  at a time and has colormixing for up to  profiles. Its a great card and VVs go to for its combat class. Perfectly fine for the champion class too.Petit Crouton is in V and is the wee sister of those two boards but sings just as sweet with  bit sound too. It can colormix in a tiny form factor delivers good sound in a tiny size for very reasonable money.  sound fonts and  accent LEDs. They just updated it to activate  sideblades and one main ala Kylo Ren.  Very impressive little card for tight spaces. Made to work off  batteries.PRIZM is in V and is a variation of the PC with all the same capabilities and made for  battery instead of . Allows real time color changing of  profiles in a sound font using the power and aux buttons.Really you cant go wrong with any of them. Ive played around with some competitors and I dont think anyone really comes close. Motion detection is very good so sounds are natural its infinitely customizable for your own sensitivities and wishes. It really is just a matter of which card works for the saber design you are wanting.When I can I prefer the CF just because I know I wont ever throw more at it than it can do. But thats just me because honestly Ive never come close to exhausting the capabilities of any of the other cards.  In all cases sounds better doesnt really apply too much. You can add the soundfont that speaks to you you can customize how it responds. Loudness is a function of layout speaker capability etc. not just the card but all these cards provide clean full signal.Naigons Spark cards are the only ones that Id consider if I couldnt get my hands on something from Plecter Labs.  The Nano Biscotte from them is OK but doesnt allow any color mixing. Cards from SF and US by comparison are junk.,lightsabers,d0vq75t,4,t5_2uc83

7716595,0,t1_d3j80q1,It isnt. Issues with SF go back many years though they certainly arent  bad. The owner of SF is banned from both FXSabers and IRA the two major lightsaber forums for fraudulent activity. In the long past he ripped a few people off. In the more recent past he has taken the original work of other smiths and reverse engineered it to a price point and sold it as his own. SF has certainly come a long way from their humble origins but they havent gotten their solely by honestly and hard work. The quality of their work is MUCH better than Ultrasabers and a lot better than it used to be but ethics wise SF is certainly questionable. ,lightsabers,d3jbob4,4,t5_2uc83

You can add speakers and soundboards to the hilts that Parks uses. The Graflex . is big enough to take whatever soundboard you want. Its not worth getting a hilt with electronics from Parks to try and add sound because youd be using literally none of the Parks electronics components for that. Youd need a new blade and a new battery.  ,lightsabers,d91cf4b,2,t5_2uc83

9429026,0,t1_d9atl86,Its not necessarily about the weight than the balance of the weight which you touch upon. Balancing near the hilt is what makes spins and stuff relatively easy you use the weight of the blade to carry against the weight of the hilt. It means rather than having to focus on constantly guiding what the hilt does you just set the blade in a direction and its own momentum will help maintain the direction. ,lightsabers,d9b6zee,1,t5_2uc83

Yeah its daunting at first but watch a few youtube videos carefully and dive in give it a shot and you got it! Theres lots of DIY install tutorial videos on youtube where you can pretty much make a list of everything they use first ones that come to mind are shameems and Rob from GCSs tutorials on TCSS youtube channel.
