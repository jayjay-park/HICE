I dont care what anyone personally feels about Deron I would hope that anyone that is or ever was a CKY fan could see that. Theyre right up there with the best that CKYForeign Objects has ever put out. The rest of the album is really good as well and I would imagine it will get better with repeated listens. ,cky,cw5bizv,2,t5_2sopg

Their influence has been most noted in the music Ive been writing recently which features some halftechnical riffs a la Inhuman Creation Station and Sink Into the Underground. Deron is one of the best riff writers of the modern age thats a fact. I guess the difference between me and you is that I love every other element of CKYs music as well.,cky,czw0rw2,2,t5_2sopg

6839191,0,t1_d0rf5cu,I dont have time at the moment to address everything here but I will just say that from talking to certain members of the band I dont get the impression that they arent interested in carrying forward and doing it right.Of course money is a motivator its their jobscareer after all. My point is that cig jess and deis are truly trying to move forward and rebuild CKY.  Without them outright showing proof of that to the world I can understand why someone would perceive that its not a priority.  Especially considering he doesnt post much of anything on social media in regards to what he is doing on that front.  I fully understand how you come to that conclusion but theres more under the surface to be considered.As for the Alliance mission statement and whatnot you are right that does apply to other communities outside of the Alliance...but those are not relative to this subreddit and the conversation at hand.  Its a mission statement that was the backbone of our drive to support this entity. And I thought I mentioned that yes the band is what bringsbrought us together. Myself nor anyone else would deny that.  But to deny that it developed into a much bigger community with deeper meanings just seems ill informed to me. I also would never say the music industry is dead but it definitely has changed.  Certain ex members of the band fought that change and its hurt them.  Others hate the changes but theyre rolling with them.,cky,d0rixuf,3,t5_2sopg

10380879,0,t3_5omw4a,I know Deron wanted to do the KISS thing here but why would Jess amp Deron go off and say that CKY albums take too long and then try to make four cds? Even if every band member made their own songs how the fuck is Jess gonna do that? it would quadruple Chads workload. Not only that but Deron would STILL have to write the skeleton of  songs regardless of the fact that  other cds are going to be released with it.To one of Jess points if there are four records made you just made four times the stolen music. Instead of releasing four records over the course of several years you release one cd album that took a fuckton of effort that will get stolen and not do well again.I seriously dont know what those two were thinking during this period. Didnt Deron leave around July  and then come back later that summer just self immolate in a blaze of embarrassment in December?,cky,dckqje2,8,t5_2sopg
