I got freaking  healersboth luthor and  valiant healer with HERA faith. Your Shizu may have weak faith but her second job the samurai goes really well with that faith unless you want her to be another class. Even if you start anew the heroes you get maybe worse than your current one. ,valiantforce,d9eo7f7,1,t5_3dexs

10365485,0,t3_5oeoi2,Honestly Leon is the best of those three you mentioned. As uaveneyer said youll bench him when you get a   guardian. But Leon has good stats for being a   comparable to a  actually. Zealot Leon could also come in handy.Speaking as someone who uses him as a placeholder obviously. You could keep all three for expedition for later down the road though.,valiantforce,dcizn7w,1,t5_3dexs
