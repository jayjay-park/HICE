5363954,0,t3_3ohrj3,I heard this one before in a class I took.....from what I remember the prof Phyllis Culham told us that archaeologists actually found a sherd with the name Aristeides written on it a few times but each was misspelled and crossed out and then finally the name was properly spelled but with a clear difference in handwriting....which means it could very well be the sherd from the story. I would provide a source if I could but cant find anything online. ,HistoryAnecdotes,cvxb0pf,1,t5_38uq1
