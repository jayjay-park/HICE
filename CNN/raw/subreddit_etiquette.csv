You can ask or invite people to help do things...  Take a turn at the grill half an hour at the bar but you need to be prepared to find outside help for those especially the bar maybe not the grill people love grilling.  Or you can put out an offer If anyone wants to work the party instead Im paying X for Y.  Or split the differencehire the bartender have people who will enjoy doing so take turns at the grill and on the music.

For a start  of ECigs have a horrible smell from the vapor and you clearly havent got a nose or havent been near many before if you think otherwise then you have the matter of them already being banned in many cities because as many studies have shown the vapor may be just as bad as second hand smoke. Dont believe me? Google it. There are multiple studies and reports about how they contain several carcinogens despite not being as bad as normal cigarettes and contain potentially harmful particles not to mention the vapor still contains nicotine and any near bystanders are going to be getting that. I dont want to breathe in that s full stop let alone when Im paying to sit down and have a comfortable meal.

If ever asked by the intended donee or the significant other why you didnt come through after all that effort and expense you could say that you figured that your friends avoiding your party which had rescheduled twice to meet hisher calendar when the friends significant other was charged with the knowledge you may have gone overboard was your friends way of politely declining your gift without a confrontation because heshe surely must have thought it was more than heshe could accept so you made other arrangements for it.

8361479,0,t3_4u4c72,Here in the more rural areas of the south you commonly see cars pull over a bit and stop while the procession goes by.  It is a sign of respect for the dead and for the friends and family even if you do not know who it actually is.  I have seen in other areas that it really depends more on the traffic situation.  In a heavy traffic area people may only slow down and not stop you also may not pull to the side of the road at all.  On a three land highway safety would trump any perceived etiquette issues I would guess.  I would simply evaluate the situation yourself and of course observe what others are doing.  If it doesnt appear to be safe to slow down stop or even pull over then you probably shouldnt.  However if others are doing so then it would of course be unsafe to go against that as well.  Do what you can but do not create an undue hazard.  ,etiquette,d5mqj90,7,t5_2r6p3
