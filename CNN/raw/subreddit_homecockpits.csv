3640441,0,t1_cq75a8t,Thanks.Basically Im interested in building a LEM like simulator for two people. Cockpit design like the real LEM meaning  or  windows. Ive been thinking that since sitting would be preferable a onewindow design would be better. This means that I probably want to have one contiguous window.What seems like the best plan at the moment is a LCD TV in portrait view between the two pilots. Multiple monitors is another option but I dont have an easy way to hook them all up to the computer driving it.Would love to hear your opinion.,homecockpits,cq78kg8,1,t5_2uf17
3668370,0,t3_32dsjv,Im actually working on laying out the panels for a MiGbis currently. Working in Sketchup and I have zero background in drafting so it doesnt exactly look pretty but it should have a fair amount of the info one would need to start building.Not ready to be put out there just yet still needs a bit of fine tuning.,homecockpits,cqaf3dt,1,t5_2uf17
