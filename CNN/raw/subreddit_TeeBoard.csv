1680431,0,t1_cjqtm6y,Oh sorry what Im saying is that I dont need the image to pop up on different spots in my browser I need it to pop up on different spots in OBSon my stream. I might be misunderstanding you though. Id like to be able to move and resize the animations freely on OBS. I want the donation animation to be prominent and topcentered and the follower animation to be small and off to the side. Currently if I make a separate source all of the sources are activated whether I get a new follower or donation. Which makes sense since I dont know how to tell Teeboard to differentiate. How would you for example make an html file that animates ONLY when I get new followers and NOT when I get new donations and vice versa.,TeeBoard,cjqzbxs,1,t5_32jac
2058195,0,t3_2iebpc,gt Any ideas? Does it have to do with that Adobe thing?In a way it does. And without getting too technical the CLR Browser now uses the default Chrome Flash Player aka PepperFlash which comes with its own set of security restrictions.Long story short make sure the path to the html file is prefixed with  which the CLR Browser plugin does by default if you use the browse for file button. Its the ? button in the CLR Browser source properties.    For a complete explanation of the issue ,TeeBoard,cl1fwnx,1,t5_32jac

4569551,0,t1_csupt3y,Sorry it took me so long to respond.I cant find a test donation button on the Streamtip website but I looked at the timestamp for my most recent tips and they dont match up. Teeboards is correct Streamtips is off different timezones it seems. But theres no way to change my time zone in the Streamtip website or on Teeboard itself that I can see. How can I resolve this issue?,TeeBoard,ct6lqo3,1,t5_32jac
