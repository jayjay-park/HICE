1627643,0,t1_cjk27wg,You have the correct picture but I dont think this is a very helpful interpretation  the function field at a point is closer to what you are describing but well get to that later.Sheaves were invented because people realised that it was much better to study functions on a space smooth functions on smooth manifolds holomorphic functions on analytic varieties etc than to study the space itself.Geometry as oppose to topology is characterised by the fact that you want to keep tract of two things global information and local information. The functions defined globally can tell you a lot about the space eg on affine varietiesschemes they tell you everything! But on some spaces eg the projective line they dont tell you very much at all  we need to know what the functions are on a more local level functions defined only on some open set to understand the space completely and how these functions match up on the overlap of these local regions. So a sheaf is a way organising this information. Local always means in an open set. To understand the structure of our space around a point we might look at a small open neighborhood and just functions defined only on that. To get an even finer picture of the structure around our point we might get a magnifying glass out and find an even smaller open set.The stalk is simply the natural limit of this process of considering smaller and smaller local neighborhoods of a point. So the stalk is telling us about an infinitesimal local neighborhood of the point. The stalk expresses the ultralocal structure of the space you are studying. In differentiable geometry terms the stalk is telling you about a function and all its derivatives.,mathbookclub,cjkbv95,3,t5_32uo5
