2336349,0,t1_cm0e050,I was looking on Glassdoor for this company Zillow and it sounds like they use these questions extensively.  I imagine that whoever is reading them has seen the same solutions  times and has a strong preference towards certain techniques and can spot at a glance things like a no package b did not use NumberFormatException c did not use Char.isDigit or ddoes not handle codepoints UU,codereview,cm0hhji,1,t5_2qvds
2733402,0,t3_2kl55z,Ok I did a little fiddling and found something that you may find interesting. In the regex used to see if a person is naming their UID I inserted an immediately invoked function. All it would do was alert hello however. When I submitted the function didnt run but cause an infinite loop of invalid message errors to emerge. At around the  error in the console . minutes later the site became unusable.,codereview,cnery9v,2,t5_2qvds
2980303,0,t3_2ttdhi,Assuming the list is properly linked just keeping a pointer to the root and iterating forward until it  root and counting should do the trick. Dont think there is a need for Tortoise and Hare here. I also dont think your algorithm would be any faster then this as it still has to go thru the n nodes.,codereview,co6vjol,1,t5_2qvds

4652224,0,t1_ctgxn8z,Whatchu think about this version?  Ill probably revamp the key system    Edit Changed key to password and from randint to input So the seed is a string the user inputs,codereview,ctgz26m,1,t5_2qvds
6416188,0,t3_43kq6m,functions have multiple returns.  It is best practice to have one return that returns a variable,codereview,cziyey4,2,t5_2qvds
10179248,0,t3_5lqf0p,Your win method is doing a lot of redundant checking. You are iterating over every cell on what I assume after every entry. Instead you could keep track of how many cells you have marked safe so far and do a simple arithmetic check to determine if you have won or not.,codereview,dbxvgyh,4,t5_2qvds
