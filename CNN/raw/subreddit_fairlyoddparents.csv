8980906,0,t1_d7ra2n4,Well I agree with you to a degree People take it too seriously especially the poorly done first episode. Shes supposed to act as a yang to Timmys yin. Though the Mary Sue  Perfect thing is I think still wrong. People get the terms mixed up. She is more of a Parody Sue rather than the former. Shes not perfect rather shes an extreme perfectionist And Perfectionism is a real thing actually. Especially in episodes after her debut its obvious that Chloe takes her good traits to such extreme levels that they often become flaws as well. Shes gone so far in the other direction of Timmy shes become just as messed up.May be spoilers belowIn Marked Man Chloe becomes so fixated on Mark Chang revealing his true self because shes so sure that people will like him for who he is. And of course as Timmy warned her there were literally government agents in the classroom waiting to take Mark down. Ultimately it takes Timmy disguising himself as an alien and threatening to wipe out Earth to get them to leave Mark alone.Girly Squirrely is another She again becomes so focused on getting a badge that she flat out ignores the fact the rest of the troop cant do anything eventually she cracks under the pressure and awakens a Bigfoot.Booby Trapped Last nights episode is another major example. Chloe has a panic attack and essentially shuts down on multiple occasions when her parents simply mention she may have made a bad choice.And those are just a couple examples theres a ton of other examples I can come up with.,fairlyoddparents,d7rd91a,2,t5_2tscn
