455033,0,t3_1z9sbo,Listen I know you are angry and I cannot even imagine what you are going through but taking your life is not the way to alleviate your pain. You have so much potential to make a difference in this world and be something greater than you can even imagine. At the very least if you are going to do this maybe do some of the things you have always wanted to do first. Travel the world go to Disneyland go to some cool wrestling events bungee jump whatever it is you have always wanted to do as long as it harms noone else go for it. What do you have to lose?I have always promised myself that if I ever tried to commit suicide again I have tried once before that I would first travel the world. At the least you have experienced some amazing things and at the most maybe you find purpose in life.If you need to talk you can message me. I am so sorry for what you have been through and what you are going through.,buzzardbrigade,cfrzi4l,5,t5_2zg21
