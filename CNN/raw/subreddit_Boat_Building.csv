10361609,0,t1_dchfrma,Ok will do but Im scared to soak all my bare wood handy work! Ill use it as an opportunity to clean and scrub all the smut off the inside of the boat. Its not really a fair assessment as Im off work at the moment so I have lots of time to work on it.  I work on a contract basis so I sometimes get a few months off at a time before the next contract starts which I have right now...hence the boat to fill my time!  Did you get anything accomplished on your pirate ship this weekend?Im still on the fence about paint or varnish.  At this very moment Im leaning towards painting the bilge and then topcoat varnishing over the existing varnish everywhere else after a light fine grit sanding.  The varnish is in pretty great shape inside and out for the most part so I figure Ill just add a few coats over top to bring back the shine and seal it a bit better.  I can always strip it down to bare wood at a later time if I wanted.  I think thats a decent approach no?  Also do you have a stain recommendation?  Ive read about powders concentrated drops etc.  The only thing I learned was to use waterbased stain under CPES and oilbased stain under varnish.  Im going to try and match the stain of the new bow decking to the sides so Ill be likely mixing a few colours together.,Boat_Building,dcijshi,1,t5_2wbg2

Haha.Thats what I will do to my motor just refresh the paint after I make sure it runs!When you fit your deck planks how do you mark the curved edge on them all so they perfectly follow the bend of the covering board?  When I do them next week I want to make sure the sikaflex seam is as uniform as possible.,Boat_Building,ddqb8kx,1,t5_2wbg2
