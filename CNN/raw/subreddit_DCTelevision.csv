483576,0,t3_1zfx83,I think it will depend on how much of an origin story they plan on doing. Ollie suited up pretty much right away on Arrow but the flashbacks to an ongoing origin make that easier. Im thinking Barry will take a while to get his powers under control which might mean a midseason suitup.Does anyone know who it is that killed Barrys parents or whatever? I only vaguely remember his story in the Arrow episode and I dont really know the comics. Didnt he say someone with super speed took him out of his apartment? Is that a villain or might there be a previous Flash to mentor him?,DCTelevision,cfv8i4y,1,t5_30pab
