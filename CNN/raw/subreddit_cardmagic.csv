5041692,0,t1_cut7nah,Unfortunately Im with Ian on this one. Overhand shuffle is your primary weapon for most of royal road. Double lift seems like a basic technique but amateurs pull it out too often and too loosely so spectators catch on. You do many basic sleights then rarely pull the DL so they dont expect it.,cardmagic,cutpqzp,1,t5_2tdo2
5338590,0,t1_cvlak84,Cardistry is geeky. But imo it is easier to practice in public. Because you cant fuck up too bad unless you drop cards with magic you can flash people fucking up your performance.But I like hoe you stayed respectful cuz a lot of magicians I spoke could only talk shit about cardistry.,cardmagic,cvu2b3m,1,t5_2tdo2
5446951,0,t1_cw7inh1,It makes sense. I but both options have pros and cons and I guess it depends on the move. How a certain tecnique works depends on the magician using the technique but on the other hand you can probably trust someone with  years more experience than you to come up with a more efficint way to do a move. So i guess there is something to say for both.,cardmagic,cw7wfo9,2,t5_2tdo2

10223530,0,t3_5med5z,It looks like a roller coaster.  The pass should be smooth and not a jerky motion.  Trying doing it very slowly so that the rock is natural. Practice it standing up.  Be in a position similar to how you will actually be performing it for people.  ,cardmagic,dc2w7ea,3,t5_2tdo2
10224428,0,t3_5med5z,Thanks for the tip! Will definitely be working on it. ,cardmagic,dc2zvgm,1,t5_2tdo2
10711869,0,t3_5t7d8k,Well theres always something to be said for the cups and balls. You can do lots of cool effects with them and are relatively easy to come by.,cardmagic,ddkuku3,3,t5_2tdo2
11281803,0,t1_dfarnvm,Thats one long way to do it. If he just wanted to learn the transpo its a stupidly long way. Vernon said you only need one good trick. Think about it kid. ,cardmagic,dfarxpa,1,t5_2tdo2
11601048,0,t3_65k1ht,There is an iphone app that has a built in stack training program.  Its mad useful and comes preloaded with a lot of common stacks.  You can also customize it.The magic tricks included are okay but the stack trainer is boss.,cardmagic,dgazkgo,2,t5_2tdo2
