10342939,0,t1_dcd3xxa,I think that its possible that if a show gets high ratings the broadcast company decides to extend its airing time thus generating more revenue to the production committee which might also improve BDDVDmerchmanga physicaldigital sales by giving the anime more visibility and as time goes on popularity I think its easier to get a feel of the characters personalities in the manga and reading it since the beginning up to the chapter where the anime ends    takes a while but eventually people could do it discuss about it on the internet or IRL and through word of mouth the manga and anime can become more popular. Not saying that many people will start buying the BDsDVDs which are expensive even for otaku but giving the anime more exposition time can help that. I also heard that chinese streaming is a new market that seems to be doing very well  Keijo has surpassed  million total views   and that the ratio between streaming revenue and BDDVD sales have been gradually shifting towards the former for every video in general and that for anime streaming is speculated to overtake BDDVD sales in   NSFW alert for yaraon  ,Keijo,dcgfiqp,1,t5_3fw27
