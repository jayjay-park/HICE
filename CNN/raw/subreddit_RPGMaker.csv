39171,0,t1_ceggrpd,I agree with this assessment. I am messing around with the VX ace engine right now and I was... very underwhelmed to say the least. The user interface is slightly more user friendly but they gutted a lot of the useful little features that really to make a difference to me such as the layering. But beyond tightening up the features theres not a whole lot of places this can go without making some dramatic shifts like DD.The chibi stock characters dont actually bother me that much mostly because if you want to move beyond hobby games you kind of have to do your own assets anyway to have a chance of standing apart from the rest of the stuff out there.Think of it like the same problem that Mugen has with fighting games or photoshop has with the professional photography community. Just because the tools exist doesnt mean that the pros go away. Sure it means that youll see a lot more glut but it also means that the real pros can do so much more with it with so much less effort. And thats a good thing. ,RPGMaker,ceiw2ez,1,t5_2sc9h

1207520,0,t1_ci5g5h0,I guess on the base level but from the looks of that link it seems for more extensive and easier to organize with Chat Mapper than typing out  conditional branches in a single event in rpg maker to make a really complex dialogue tree.

1214402,0,t3_27ypiz,Its feasible enough. Youd need to remake the appearance of the maps and click on all the events to change to any new sprites. More of a pain in the ass than preventative. Its my understanding that major professional studios dont wait on the final version of assets before getting into the mechanical construction of the games core... Or even the initial assets in some cases. Seems no different than writing a novel at least in the sense that you dont need to get everything in the final completed form first pass.

1343563,0,t3_29eg92,Id say I have a slight preference for sideview but Id also say that the choice should depend on other factors in your game like party size and troop size. For example the frontview system worked perfectly for your game where you were the monster and had v fights. As I said in my review I believe the frontview battle system was one of the strong points of your game.Im usually on the fence about active input systems. I think that they can be excellent if done right and doing them right involves balancing just how much time the player spends inputting commands. A huge combo ability that takes long to input should not be able to be used every turn for example. To relate this to your monster game Performing the Confusion combo attack over and over would be a bit tedious its a great ability but should be limited somehow to only be available every few turns imo. A few games that do combosinput right Xenogears Super Mario RPG Gladius. Xenogears has awesome combos as a core battle system. Super Mario RPG has an excellent crit system Simply press A when your character connects with the enemy to do more damage. This simple system ends up adding to the pace and player involvement of every battle.For games where you have a party of  people I generally prefer sideview. I never really liked imagining seeing the enemy through my partys firstperson perspective and much prefer seeing all my actors sprites on the battlefield. Games like Earthbound have done it successfully but I dont think it added anything to the game. In my opinion the only reason that I might go for a system like this in a party based RPG is time constraintstechnical limitations.,RPGMaker,cikrlgm,1,t5_2sc9h

If youre new to git use SourceTree to make it easy. This will allow you to make backups of all of your changes. That way you can make experimental changes without worrying about messing everything up.Edit The ability to control if someone can alter files is useful for including playtesters or people you want to take a look at your code without being able to change it.,RPGMaker,ciwbxdd,1,t5_2sc9h

3931931,0,t3_35g4q6,   First of all I would like to congratulate you on completing this project. Most RMers never see this stage of their projects.   I do have some criticism which you can take or leave coming from a professional in the industry.    From the screens youve shown and the video on the site the mapping looks abysmal. I see mapping errors the tiles dont seem to be flush with one another and theres nothing done to remove the feeling of a gridbased map. This is to be expected for any RPG Maker projects but if you are looking to sell the game even for . it needs to be a whole lot more polished that this. Have you seen Ash on ios? They used the same rpgmaker rtp graphics but gave the game a great overall polish that really makes that game stand out from any RPG Maker projects. I saw in the cutscene that the art styles for the characters faces dont even match another strike against the polish.gt This looks like your run of the mill RPG Maker game. What makes it different than any other RPG?    This is a statement you really dont want any player asking if you are going to charge any amount for your product.    Honestly RPG Maker games just dont go over well as a sold product. The only ones to ever make any profit and that profit being small didnt even use the rpg maker graphics let alone the amount of custom scripts written for the game to help it feel less RPGMakerey. There are at least  games that look just like yours on steam that make the same promise that the Story is unique or that the Mechanics are new and fresh But those projects hardly see enough revenue to make selling them worth your time.TLDR Congrats for the completed project as my personal opinion as a professional in the game dev industry your game just doesnt look polished enough to be a sold porduct,RPGMaker,cr4h4lc,5,t5_2sc9h

4016986,0,t1_cre4lxf,Thats right the stuff that comes with the game is open to use even for commercial. That base of the assets that comes with the game is usually referred to as the RTP. Any paid DLC will also be open source for commercial use. Majority of my assets are by third parties in the RM forums   most of these people have a all you have to do is credit me policy so I nab their stuff and make note of their name assuming my games ever go anywhere lol.Do consider developing a very simple art style and perhaps implementing it ingame. A guy that somewhat frequents this forum made a game called Friend a  minute puzzle game using RPG Maker. Just google Friend RPG Maker.I thought the game itself was pretty meh still better than my released games  I have none but the art style was fantastic and a great example of what Im talking about. It is not hard stuff to draw at all but instead of coming off as this guy cant draw it comes off as this was a stylistic choice. And a slick one at that.,RPGMaker,cre60lf,1,t5_2sc9h
4019569,0,t1_crefghv,gtI am talking about the look of the system. RTP is going to look a certain way unless you modify the art.This is completely true. Some games will not work in the RTP style. I would never make a gritty horror game in the artstyle. But for the majority of not super gritty RPGs its a style I like.gt There are some commercially successful games using this platform but many consumers on steam criticize them for using RTP.This is what I mean about not respecting the RTP. People dont bat an eye at the sound effects major companies recycle but visuals get people in an uproar.gt People want something fresh and iconic its really difficult to convince them that mechanics alone are enough reason to justify the price of a game which is essentially what you say when you create no new art or music.Hmm really? Crap. I honestly feel like that sums up everything I think has gone wrong with the game industry in the last  years.Personally I am all about the mechanics. I do not mind when a sequel uses the same art assets and I feel like companies are wasting huge amount of money on new graphics to the detriment of gameplay. Then again I play things like DwarfFortress and NetHack.gtTiles would be the least of my worries. I am talking about generating objects characters and an art style that are unique. I think thats the thing. I could really care less if the art style is unique. Old RPGs dont look super distinct from each other and new ones all have the same over the shoulder Skyrim look. Usually with a muted palette these days.I always found Never Winter Nights awesome precisely because it gave you numerous games and campaigns within a single style of engine and art.When it comes art I feel get it right and stick with it should be a valid alternative if your games themes dont demand something different.I really like horizontal rather than vertical expansion of art. Making  expansions for a game and showing off tons of environments in that style is going to interest me a lot more than a sequel that starts from scratch in higher poly detail. So while I acknowledge your points though they frustrate me I have to wonder if another part of this is branding. People love Lego Harry Potter despite it looking almost the same as Lego Star Wars. The thing is those products are good. The RTP itself may be less of a concern here than the number of bad games made using them that spoil the association.Also since youre point of view is so different Im wondering if I can get your opinion on the RTP style in my current project Do you think the inclusion of new graphics helps or do you think the RTP style spoils the effort? My goal is to counterbalance the familairity of the style by expanding it to include the details of the game setting. It doesnt hurt that the setting itself was largely inspired from FFT and DampD type games and I like high saturation palettes.,RPGMaker,cregmdu,2,t5_2sc9h

4531212,0,t3_3d4q7l,I use a spreadsheet. Edit your EXP curve I put all the sliders except for Extra all the way up so as to have a steep curve and write down in your spreadsheet the EXP required for each level not total exp. Label that with Actor level   etc.In a separate column estimate how much EXP each monster at that level should give. Label that list of XP with Monster level   so on.Now just use those two columns to make a table which shows how many monster kills does it take to level for each ActorMonster level. Adjust the monster EXP values as needed to give yourself a nice flow you want the actor to be able to level up after killing a reasonable amount of monsters within their level range but it should be slightly unreasonable to level up off of monsters below your level.For instance if you look at my sheet it takes . Monster kills for a level  actor to level to  when killing level  monsters thats pretty reasonable  battles. But it would take . kills for a level  actor to level to  off of the same level  monsters now were getting grindy.Ultimately your player can always choose to grind and were also limited when using the sliders on the EXP curve so its never an exact science. But this should help keep things a bit balanced.Heres a copy of my sheetThe yellow highlights represent when an actor is defeating monsters their own level and the orange areas represent an actor attempting to level off of monsters one level below them.Its not all about just the curve though the next step is balancing exactly what a level gives you. Its much harder to balance if going from level  to level  doubles MHP for example.

6388204,0,t1_czehvtx,Thats what I though as well when I get MV. However the performance on MV game run in Android is really disappointing. What MV does is make the game as HTML app. You then have to convert this HTML app into Android APK so you can install directly to as APK file on Android free or upload to Play store setup fee. The setup took me about a morning a few hours I know because I did it twice as I did a flash install of Windows not too long after the first time I setup. Once you setup it took only a few minutes to convert the game to APK. The result game have some performance issue due to the poor support of HTML audio on Android. I got randomly between  to  fps depends on how many things happening on the screen andor is it loading audio file. I try both ARM CPU device and x device and result are about the same. So if your only mean to get MV is about about to export the game to mobile then you may want to reconsider. When I get MV I had the impression of it would be just push a button but it turns out its pretty far from it. ,RPGMaker,czfrte2,3,t5_2sc9h

6607604,0,t1_d02ru74,Yes Ive toyed with that method as well however that limits a onehanded weapon to be classified as either offhand or weapon main hand meaning you couldnt wield  of the same weapons or a weapon designated off hand could never be equipped in the main hand and vise versa. This was actually my first approach and scrapped it for the reasons above. Actually if it werent for that one issue Id have gone this route due to simplicity.Sorry if Im being picky and possibly over complicating things heh. But thank you for taking the time to look at my issue.On a side note I also have shields set as weapons instead of armor. It works because when I equip say a H sword itll grant dual wielding allowing me another slot to equip something say a shield or another sword. Of course the player could also equip a shield in the main hand but since it isnt set to grant dual wielding they wont have access to another weapon slot.,RPGMaker,d02s5uk,1,t5_2sc9h

6930869,0,t1_d11km6g,Alright I agree with you on graphic designing and vector art. I tend to use my mouse for stuff like that too. But I believe it to be a bit different. And I clicked your link but closed it rather quickly due to the NSFW so I apologize that I cant view it.The thing with using a tablet is the pen allows for a certain precision that a mouse doesnt have. With the tablet you can raise and lower sensitivity and size of brush by the way you press down. To do this with a mouse Ive had to sort of fake it by using the eraser tool but its a very tedious process and takes a lot of extra time. In the end the results are always worse than if I had just done it with the tablet. I used to draw with my mouse before I got my tablet as well as when my tablet was broken.I wont deny the mouse can be used to make decent stuff with enough time and dedication. But if you can make something good with the mouse imagine how much better it could be with more than double the speed and precision. So my opinion just stands as this Theres no reason to use a mouse over a tablet if you have the money. For art other than vectorpixelstuff that just involves mostly flat shapes. And if someone is generally new to art and doesnt have really high dedication they would be better off finding free art assets instead of making their own with a mouse.,RPGMaker,d11xtnw,2,t5_2sc9h

7771475,0,t3_4lrbq3,My system is glaringly basic. I didnt want players to have to grind but there is in fact a line between grinding and fighting enemies to get stuff. For example from a players perspective having to fight an enemy or two to get enough money to buy this thing they really want is fine.Fighting a hundred is not.So I started off small. Each item was about g to g. Enemies dropped around g a piece so an average encounter would yield g to g. Then I did a play test. What did players buy? What didnt they buy? How much gold did they have floating around? In my case players bought Potions a LOT and gear a lot with plenty of gold left over. So upped the gear prices by a tad Potions almost doubled in price. Next test showed players skipping gear to buy Potions so I knew that I had gone a bit overboard.From there the question is why are Potions more valuable to a player than gear which ended up being that I had given players gear as a quest reward but never Potions. So inherently they viewed them as more rare. Lowered Potion prices upped gear prices and added Potions as drops. Next test showed much less gold left over so from there it was just creating the thought in the players head of do I have enough? Even though I knew they would. Pretty much dont worry about it so much. Start small. Figure out what players do how they react. Think about why. From there make changes to see how it warps your environment of play. So long as you dont over stay your welcome in combat players wont view it as grinding.,RPGMaker,d3pjymh,5,t5_2sc9h
7774892,0,t1_d3ptf7m,There are a lot of good takeaways from this post. Thank you.Ive been thinking of how to prevent a hardcore grind while simultaneously preventing the player from becoming a billionaire and this is what Ive come up with Firstly youre comment about gear. My game takes place in the gritty fantasy world akin to the viking ages. It would be pretty easy to implement high prices for good gear as metal was pricey and skilled desired itemcraftsman we not available in every town. Having an equipment setup for many pieces helmet chest legs boots gloves main weapon offhand etc can allow for significant investments before a character is maxedout.Another good way I could keep the bank account in check is durability. Implementing gear with limited durability could work as a moneysink as you progress. Especially with my games  playable characters keeping their gear in good repair will cost a lot of money. In terms of drops Im currently doing this you kill a monster it drops an item. That item has a limited resale value. If you collect enough and with the appropriate additional components you can craft items to sell for a decent profit. Example You kill a Wolf you occasionally get an Animal Pelt  Gold. You take that animal pelt and process if into Soft Leather  Gold once you learn that skill. You can then take that  Soft Leathers and with a more advanced skill create Leather Armor  Gold. Each step up the value chain yields you profit and youll want to train your characters handle these tasks. My only worry is the risk of grinding on this method to make easy money so I need to devise a limiting factor. ,RPGMaker,d3pxxlc,2,t5_2sc9h

That way you know who youre summoning in this case.Make a common event for the skill that way whenever the party member is added whenever the skill is used in battle. Be sure to set up a conditional branch checking to make sure that the member is or isnt in the party already that way you dont end up adding the same party member a ton of times. Be sure to make the skill call the common event.Add a state in the game that activates whenever the skill is used and whenever try to make it so that whenever the state disappears the party member vanishes as well.Be sure to have the skill disappear on battle end and if needed have an auto run event on your maps to make sure the party member is removed if theyre still present after the battle.If all else fails theres always scripting. ,RPGMaker,d766pp3,1,t5_2sc9h

9179620,0,t1_d8fkbju,There is No Trigger party swapping Menu option is there? I didnt see one on the event page. I should have mentioned Im pretty much clueless when it comes to eventing so when you say its easily done I think you mean its easily done for people who know how to event. lolLike I know some things like I think Id have to make a conditional branch to check whether a party member is in my group. If they arent in the group their sprite will appear on the Airship but if theyre in the active party it wont. Though honestly Im still not even sure thats how youd go about doing it. as I said Im still kinda clueless when it comes to eventing at least eventing properly.,RPGMaker,d8fl12p,1,t5_2sc9h

9328322,0,t3_588i1j,gt Does MV have any super great advantages over VX Ace?Its my understanding that people have made some pretty cool stuff with MV already. One advantage is crossplatform. MV is designed to make games that work on mobile devices as well as Windows and other operating systems. Ive seen people post that you can change some basic things like tile grid sizes and such fairly easily.,RPGMaker,d8yflp2,3,t5_2sc9h

9741533,0,t3_5eo0qw,For room height you have to figure in the height of the walls as part of it. I wouldnt overthink it too much. You can get away with pushing the interior sizes a little just dont make anything super unbelievable. ,RPGMaker,daduual,3,t5_2sc9h
9751261,0,t3_5etl8o,Script language of choice even if it is Ruby please state CWhat is your level of experience? Nonprofessional some college courses.Have you made your own scripts before? Yes though never released any to the public. Most advanced one I made was a crafting system that created custom equipment and appended the database with the creation as opposed to a crafting system where the result must be defined in the database before it can be made this script dynamically created the equipment based on the materials used.Are you keen on editing other peoples scripts? Thats how I started and often what I did if I had an idea for a system and found a script that was close to the idea but not exactly. No need to reinvent the wheel.Other script language of choice Ruby CSince when did you start studying scripts? Back in RPG Maker XP prior to  since I was still in high school.Advice for those new in the field of scripting? If in relation to RM start by editing and studying other peoples scripts. Look for wellcommented ones that explain what the functions do and how it works. Youll get a good basic understanding that way. Then create basic ones on your own. My first was a simple one that gave me a second accessory slot but it taught me enough to move forward.Coding in general practice and start with ANY code. RGSS is great for beginners to learn basic syntax. Dont think that what you learn is exclusive though. I learned RGSS first then jumped to GML Game Makers launguage and finally to C for class with some C for Unity. What I learned in RGSS carried to GML making it easier to pick up and that transfered GREATLY to C near identical syntax. The basics and ideas are the same even if the methods are different.Committed or hobby only? To coding or RM? RM is a hobby at best for me since I see the flaws in it by design that other engines dont have one of the reasons I switched from RM to GM. Coding is my second favorite part of game dev after the actual design. I love being able to envision a system and then code it into existence its like an amazing puzzle.And about your edit everyone starts off bad at code. No one is just born with it. Even people who have a knack for it are tripped up in the beginning when learning. The difference between those people and others who stay bad at it is passion and drive. If you continue to push to get better and truly enjoy doing it you will get better. If you push but dont enjoy it you may get better but at a much slower rate and be miserable the whole time. So only push yourself to code if you actually enjoy it or youre honestly wasting your time. Dont do things you dont enjoy lifes too short.,RPGMaker,daf24qd,3,t5_2sc9h

10906569,0,t1_de4q1j9,That is a good piece of advice. Always helpful to have other people look at your map to spot mistakes and such. Can also just step away from it for a while couple days or so and then look at it. Youll usually catch a few little things that way.And yea tilesets can be a big source of frustration but luckily if you dont mind setbashing a little bit you can get something that is pretty workable fairly easy. Just gotta experiment and play around a little bit.,RPGMaker,de4xohr,1,t5_2sc9h

11394992,0,t3_62jy7u,MV and VX Ace are almost identical. The only few features that are different you wouldnt know how to use if youre at beginner level anyways. Whatever tutorials that may have helped you with VXA will also apply in MV unless its a tutorial for a ruby script. If you go to the rpgmaker forums tutorials section are tutorials for pretty much everything. Here is what I referred to when I started using RPGMaker And then i played the variables game by Celianna and that teaches a lot and it teaches it very well. Youll have to open it up in VXA but the knowledge translates over to MV.E i actually just opened the MV tutorials and this is specifically what youre asking for.

11400211,0,t3_62n23u,It sounds like youve never finished a project. If thats true start with something small. Really small. Like  town and  dungeon. Jumping into something big right off the bat is a very common beginner trap. Your first game is going to be shit. Make it short so you can finish it and learn from it before investing lots of time and energy into something longer.,RPGMaker,dfo76wc,2,t5_2sc9h
