5181422,0,t1_cvahbmc,Its a thing you can observe about human nature often people dislike people who look too much like a mirror image. Tomoko in particular doesnt want to be known as an otaku doesnt want people to find out she spends a lot of time watching anime and such.This may be her biggest obstacle to making friends shes deliberately pushing away anybody who shares her actual interests because she wants to be somebody completely different than who she is. If she would only start hanging out with those gaming geeks in her class shes probably even have a boyfriend already  but hed be a boyfriend like Kotomi somebody who reminds her too much of who she really is herself.So she reaches out to people who are completely unlike herlike the delinquent. So she gets punched. ,watamote,cvajunm,1,t5_2wshs

6043731,0,t1_cybu5go,I didnt think she shot directly at the door we do see her shooting in the air but I guess her shooting at the door is represented by the flurry of pellets we see in front of the door knob.Maybe she was trying to shoot the lock off with a pellet gun! Anyway it seems to be another case of Kuroki coming out relatively unscathed after doing something dangerously stupid. Firing at stuff at close range like that she could have very easily put out an eye or worse. Another recent news story just this year a guy got killed when a toy gun shot a projectile through his brain.Such things arent dependable enough for actual defense but they arent safe.

6163159,0,t3_3zz31h,I hate to admit it but things are looking too great for any anime continuation. A lot of us thought that if Watamote had any good chance of airing a second season it would have been this spring. And unfortunately almost all the anime for spring have already been announced. Not to mention Silver Link the studio that made Watamote has already announced a handful of anime they are working on.There probably will not be a season  of Watamote. However if you havent already I recommend reading the manga. It has a lot more content than the anime does and is still being released.,watamote,cyq6s06,6,t5_2wshs

God forbid it does because right now all I want is a constant watamote stream of content.From the information youve told me it seems like they are pushing watamote quite a bit and hopefully something sparks a second season! ,watamote,cz9fsb5,3,t5_2wshs

8028583,0,t3_4p4b4j,If your aim is to help DVD sales then there is a more realistic path and thats what Im trying to do which is to promote WataMote on YouTube with the DVD trailer. It doesnt cost anything it just needs participation.Im not trying to promote mine in particular but either help by making another one or help this one get more eyes. If you have a Tumblr blog the trailer post it through WordPress tweet it etc. None of this is hard sell or spamming as long as youre not doing it over and over.There is an official trailer for the DVD but while its not bad I dont think its effective. If you dont know the series already you cant really even tell what its about.If somebody has an idea for a trailer that might do an even better job of clinching sales let me know. The technical difficulty in making a trailer with the dialogue is that I have no way of eliminating some of the louder bits of incidental music so I tend to have to select scenes where the background noise has gone away.If you think a trailer on YouTube cant be effective...

8126004,0,t3_4qiphc,The anime covers most of the material in volumes .So the quick start is Volume  which begins about the time Tomoko attends graduation ceremonies then quickly starts her second year of high school which is also a new trajectory for her life.A full start would be Volume  which begins with her trip to the red light district but includes several chapters the anime didnt get to including a marathon her th birthday and the reason why her brother will not speak to her once he starts going to the same high school.Start with Volume  and youll find the anime actually did a pretty good job of including everything except the structure is different. The manga is in shorter bites. The anime tended to be about three chapters perfectly stitched together but sometimes with some time shifts.Most fans recommend starting with Volume  but personally I had a hard time reviewing her Isolation Theater so soon after the anime. I dont see a problem with skipping ahead then going back and reading the earlier stuff when youre better acclimated to the manga style. You really wont miss too much starting with Volume  or .To help you decide you could browse the fan translations which are organized by volume. WataMote is an online comic so the idea is to buy the volumes when you can. When you see us keeping up with the new chapters the only way to do that is through the fan translations usually posted within  hours of the online version at GanGan Online.,watamote,d4tfprg,3,t5_2wshs

8916864,0,t3_52aar2,No Tomoko growing as a person and subsequently chumming with more people might improve the anime. Really its Tomoko improving not the anime. It seems the secret was putting herself out there since it turns out plenty of people are willing to hang out with Tomoko even if they do think of her as an...eccentric. I doubt Tomoko sees it that way though based on what she thought at the beach trip.

10165243,0,t3_5ljxes,Still almost three weeks to go to the next Watamote update!We left off before the Christmas special with a bit of a role reversal Tomokos little brother coming into her room for a change.When we first met Tomoko she practically couldnt speak to anyone in public anymore. She wanted to use her brother to try becoming comfortable with conversation again but he seemed incredulous that she didnt have even one friend that she could talk to instead.A year later and shes made several friends one way or another through the class trip and other encounters. She is still mostly a weirdo outsider but things are getting better in some ways even though she now finds having to comingle with others a bigger pain than being alone.She has become particularly aggressive in defending her little brother from girls. This is probably not just love for her brother but also the possessive streak she always displays such as when she discovered Yuuchan made another friend while she was off one day sick in middle school.,watamote,dbwabme,14,t5_2wshs

She didnt seem to be one of their group during that year and according to Komiyama the group basically dissolved the next year because she was assigned to another class.She would have been more likely Komiyamas replacement the next year except that in every flashback she appears Komiyama is there as well. I suppose this should be dismissed as Kawamotosan simply being a classmate who sat with them sometimes and not so much a friend in the sense that Yuuchan was friends with Mokocchi and Komiyama.,watamote,dcaram4,3,t5_2wshs
