4402551,0,t1_cslvkb6,Gerard raised an eyebrow at Johanins tone wondering what his King was thinking. Something is bothering him tonight that is certain. He usually ignores remarks like that.Apologies Your Majesty I meant nothing by it. He frowned slight as he uncrossed his arms assuming a slightly more formal stance. If things were up to Gerard he would rid the world of all the formalities and posturing replacing them with honesty. But they were not so he would observe them whenever necessary. Beron will make a capable ruler I think but he will require capable advisers around him. Perhaps a strong woman by his side as well. He stroked his chin thoughtfully wondering what made Johanins thoughts wander to this subject. Teresia will do well wherever she goes I think. Perhaps you can position her to be a strong ally for her brother when the time comes.He paused for a brief moment before adding Of course those are only thoughts from a lowly Captain. I do not mean to overstep my bounds. And if you dont mind me saying something seems to trouble you this evening.,wheeloftimerp,cslwhse,4,t5_38u4l

We all assume hell want to take Tear to prove that he is indeed the Dragon Reborn. Everyone knows this and this makes him predictable.

Going above on the deck she found the Brown Sister nearby and cautiously approached. It would not do to barge in if Adrinne Sedai was busy with something.

4849756,0,t1_cu24p61,Adaran read Lady Avileas invitation with great interest. He generally never took part in the politics of Cairhien. Murandians dont have any patience for the Great Game but with the False Dragon at his doorstop making friends in high places is now a necessity. King Laman is one of the more powerful monarchs of the Westlands. Adaran was certain every King or Queen on the continent had received the same invitation. It was a great opportunity for making friends in high places and possibly getting the help he needed to unite Murandy under his rule. Theris send a reply to Lady Avilea. Thank her for the invitation and let her know Ill be in attendance. Adarans manservant bowed and left the study leaving the King to make plans for the event. ,wheeloftimerp,cu5uin3,2,t5_38u4l

He gave a grin that seemed more like a grimace to Avilea and a deep bow. Marewin with cheeks reddened by heat and wine surreptitiously straightened her bonnet and inclined her head gracefully to Avilea.My lady! It is a pleasure to finally meet you. I thank you for the invite. It is a pleasant thing to know we have friends in other Kingdoms. A slender finger tapped on his arm and Marewin started to sign to her brother finishing it with another happy smile at their host. Ailron translated.You also have my thanks my lady. The celebration is wonderful. I dont exactly get out much due to my disability. Not the best company. So thank you so much.,wheeloftimerp,cu853ay,4,t5_38u4l

5184541,0,t1_cvavi52,Nicoli pondered this for a while. It was ironic. With these people on his side he could achieve what his brother only dreamed of taking the Stone of Tear something which had never been done before. On the other hand these people were probably mad and he would be torn apart by a mob for letting these people in. At this rate he had to march if only to distract the populace. But this time the odds would be much better than when his brother decided to set out on his foolish idea. It was truly tragic that he ended up dying because of Nicolis assumption that the other council members had everything in hand. Yes he would work with them and he would be able to maintain that he was forced if things went south surely any reasonable person would see that the choices were to submit or die. There was no way Tear would agree to such a deal they were very opposed to channeling. Nicoli always viewed things pragmatically. The very fact that the Niendaani offered this meant they wanted to minimize bloodshed Amadicia was just an unfortunate casualty of a misunderstanding. It do be agreed. I accept the Covenant. I ask one thing though. To the east there do be a nation which we have fought for generations. They do not have the same opinion of channeling as we do they are unlikely to accept the Covenant so I fear we must take Tear by force obviously with a minimum of casualties. The armies of Illian do be ready as this war has been coming for a while. No need to mention the details. I will inform the people of the Covenant and the upcoming grand triumph.,wheeloftimerp,cvaxeeu,1,t5_38u4l
5511782,0,t1_cwfua3y,Your lands? asked Nicoli. Certainly you mean her lands? We do no have an agreement. I thought that you were the lord of this place and you do no seem concerned about your niece.I agree said Dallin. You do no be trustworthy and your words here have proven this. I did be against this venture from the start saying that any loyal lord would not go for this. Now we find out this man do no be head of his house!Hold on responded Gregorin. Certanly we need more time to think about this. There do be many benefits of getting more territory one of which is more trade revenue.If you agree to this we will help you said Ellara. What would be the point otherwise? I will try to convince these fools that this do be in the best interest of Illian.But this man has no standing! shouted Nicoli.He do clearly be the real power responded Gregorin. And if you do be worried so much about his niece why not go rescue her yourself?Stop shouting youre disturbing my rest said Spiros.Spiros pay attention! It seems the deciding vote will be up to you said Nicoli.Oh? Well of course I vote yes said Spiros.Then it do be settled said Gregorin. All that remains do be is for Mianin to agree.Hold on a second Nicoli responded. Spiros what exactly do you be voting yes to?To lowering taxes. That do be what we were talking about? Spiros asked.What? Thats not it at all! We do be voting on whether to offer this man a seat on the Council and protection under Illian! Nicoli shouted.Well why should he get to be on the Council? I say we do it but only if he is not offered a spot. I see. Nicoli responded curtly.This do be our offer. Jump off the sinking ship of Murandy and join us. Ellara turned from the man. And before you speak up Nicoli remember that you do be only First Councillor and not a king. The deal goes through regardless of whatever worries you have about his niece. And Spiros what does it matter if he do be on the Council? Certainly he would make a beter councillor than you.,wheeloftimerp,cwg6hvc,3,t5_38u4l
