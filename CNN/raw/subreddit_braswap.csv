324226,0,t1_cfedgsz,Not sure youd have to know a bit about mathematics.On bratabase you can measure the bra and it tells you what bras in what sizes also have that measurement diameter of like a hemisphere depth and underwire length kinda like a mix of an ellipsoid and a hemisphereOn wikipedia if you search bra fitting then scroll to the bottom of the page it tells you the breast volume for certain sister sizes. Maybe if you had small beads and filled the cups or something it might work?,braswap,cfedkjc,1,t5_2u5gg

Another review says its good for tall roots as well. As for depth yes it is definitely not as deep as Freya plunges.
