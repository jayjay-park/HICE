71564,0,t3_1uwele,As far as what the characters want for the personal goal at the start of the film I feel like that should be an unconscious want. There had to be a personal NEED that is separate from the plot goal. John Mclain NEEDS to realize that hes been a bit of a selfish jerk to his wife in order to be willing to possibly sacrifice himself for the plot goal. However at the beginning of the movie he WANTS to just get his wife back by saying I love you not Im sorry. He doesnt want to find his flaws and change them at the start of the film but thats what he NEEDS to best the bad guys. There ought to be two character personal goals at the start that are unrelated to the plot goal  a conscious WANT and an unconscious NEED. When these two things are opposite from each other pulling the character into act two is much more difficult and filled with personal conflict. Either way there does need to be a personal goal outside of the plot goal. Great post. ,Screenwriting,cemkri7,2,t5_2qupf

349635,0,t3_1y29df,I havent read the other comments here yet but right away I wanted to respond  Im sympathetic to this situation because the same has happened to me but ultimately I feel that once youve handed over your script the project becomes part of a collaborative medium unless youve negotiated yourself some incredible amount of control via becoming an EPDirector on the project.  Its important to know when you start a project whether you really want it to be yours or whether youre okay with others having creative control.  If youre uncomfortable with the latter on that particular script then pursue making it yourself.  If youre comfortable with the latter it can be a liberating experience to trust in the creativity and intelligence of others because its very easy to get too close to your own work.

They may ask you to do X but what you need to figure out is why they need you to do X and see if theres a better way to handle that.To be fair there are also notes which are utterly blunt.  I sat in on a meeting for an action film.  A sequel to a movie based on a video game which has a host of characters thats all Ill say.   The head exec had this note  You can only have one black guy and he cant be the lead.Sounds unreasonable?  Well the vast majority of sales are overseas and in particular Asia for this kind of movie.

Your character has a problemflaw and he must grow in order to properly deal with this plot andor its antagonist. But its not that simple of course. So the subplot or romance is another reflection of internal conflict. This is where you dramatize his problem outside of the main plot. And these two stories are connected by a common theme. So if his problem is he cant assert himself or hes afraid to be candid and thats why he cant solve the main problem its also a problem in love. And B learns this in the love story which informs him how to deal with the main problem or antagonist. At least thats one way to approach it. ,Screenwriting,cgru0r3,2,t5_2qupf

In a sense its certainly a good thing that Hollywood has a tiny bit of conscience even if its  years late and mostly dishonest.

1062769,0,t3_267ggh,  You have that  wrong.   Your script should be predominantly dialog with sparse action direction and scene descriptions sufficient for explaining whats happening and nothing more.   If your film is scifi and requires a bunch of information then youll likely have more action direction than say a family drama.   Most readers dont read the action direction at all.  You define a character by their words and their actions and nothing else.  If the characters goal doesnt come across in words and actions then it doesnt actually exist.  Short films never do well.

1326304,0,t1_ciisetr,I should be more specific with Data. Him not understanding humor and other emotions makes a lot of sense. It also raises the sorts of questions science fiction is good at exploring like what exactly is anger?Where Data becomes cringe worthy is his lack of knowledge of basic idioms and figures of speech the kinds of things your average dictionary includes. For instance the burn the midnight oil scene It also doesnt make sense for Data to ask OBrien the etymology of the word. Hes been around humans long enough to become a Starfleet Lieutenant and should thus be generally aware of human intelligence. Scene would work better if he suddenly ignored OBrien and began asking the computer about the phrase because he knows the computer will have the answer. That would highlight that hes unaware of what rudeness consists of.With Bones she works best when she misses a social cue or misreads a situation. Her intelligence remains consistent as she interprets what she believes are the facts but her poor social skills cause her to operate from a false set of assumptions and then shed compound the error by being poor at communicating understanding social subtleties in an academic sense but sucking at using them because shes so hyperaware. She sucks when she doesnt understand that ridiculing someones religion to their face would piss them off  an anthropologist would be pretty damn aware of how serious people take religion even if she doesnt relate to those beliefs.And the Big Bang Theory is just notoriously lazy in every way. They called reductio ad absurdum a logical fallacy when in fact its one of the most powerful moves in formal logic and the most common way of proving a theorem the other move is conditional introduction. They dont understand how World of Warcraft is played.

1494791,0,t3_2bab3d,First off congrats. When I first made the shift to writing I worked in the industry but in a different field like you and got some notice I signed with a very big agency. Things were okay for the first few months I was getting meetings and getting read and my script had heat etc. etc. and then a couple of things fell through and all of a sudden my agents kind of just cooled off as well. Sure I was getting meetings still but they werent aggressively trying like they once were.The problem was that I was basically just a script to them at that point. Now that isnt to say they were doing anything wrong. Between my two guys there were a handful of Alist writers and directors and Im just the newest Joe Schmuckface on their roster. I guess my concern with you bringing this deal to an agent and hoping to have a long career with them is that A the big agents wont be able to wet their beaks enough to sign you just based on the one deal and B a smaller agent may take you on just to cop a quick commission and then let you fall off their radar once youve fulfilled your purpose to them.My advice get a lawyer or get a manager who will help you maximize this deal and build more opportunities from that. I have a manager now from a producer referral and although I am now with a different big agency I have a guy who is looking out for me every step of the way running interference with producers and my agents to make sure I dont get lost in the shuffle etc. Agents want deals but you can make a deal with an attorney just as easily. If youre looking to build a career a manager may be the key at this point. Heshe will help you get an agent that is a good fit for you when the time is right. ,Screenwriting,cj3nasj,2,t5_2qupf

That sounds fun in general and could be a nice spinoff of this the teams that wrote the highest rated scripts could square off in a final round even if the individual writers didnt do as well.

Maybe let people watch the two in parallel with a tape delay.Edit P.S. what you suggested is kind of how it would work already just on a larger scale.

1729930,0,t1_cjwpv61,I dont see Sin City overperforming by much if at all. The world is fucked up as all hell right now so most people wont want to go to something so bleak. I am a fan myself but I am debating whether I really want to go see it or not plus its not very well reviewed. Its not a property that has broad appeal either and waiting nine years between movies doesnt help matters. You will get lots of single twenty somethings and thats about it. I know  opened strong but its more accessible than the Sin City universe. You have it opening up against If I Stay starring a strong Chloe Grace Moretz. If a guy and his girlfriend or man and wife are going to the cinema this weekend theyre not going to go to see Sin City. They will end up seeing If I Stay or Guardians. Given the success of A Fault in Our Stars and other YA stuff lately it seems destined to have a strong opening. Ive actually seen it and its good for what it is although not really my cup of tea since I am a  year old dudefree tickets to a screening. Chloe does a great job though and you can see shes actually becoming a really good actress although her whimper face looks kind of funny because she gets this weird wrinkle on her chin that looks like a man frowning but I digress.Now if you compare the marketing campaigns between the two you will also see some telltale signs. Sin City has done hardly anything. They did garner some headlines with booby gate controversy over the poster but that really didnt generate much buzz and would only cause more twenty something single dudes to come out to see the aforementioned boobs instead of expanding the audience. Theres a reason it took nine years to get funding to get it made. I mean look at what happened with the Spirit.On the flip side Chloe Grace Moretz promoted the ever living hell out of If I Stay. I mean shes really a team player. Lots of actors and actresses will do a couple press junkets but she literally went coast to coast doing poster signings meet and greets Twitter questionnaires Google Hangouts in multiple countries and languages plus the typical talk show circuit. I mean if I ever am in a position to cast her I would do it in an instance. She really understands how to get people out to the theater and goes the extra mile. Anyways thats just my take.Id go with this. If I Stay   million opening week. Sin City    million opening week. Guardians of the Galaxy   million. Ninja Turtles  . million. When the Game Stands Tall   million,Screenwriting,cjx80mo,1,t5_2qupf

1818161,0,t3_2fdeoq,Formatting aside as others have already mentioned this is a three page long exposition dump.  And most of it has no reason to exist in this particular scene.I suspect that anyone that has read the scene probably already rewrote in their heads if not otherwise.  But heres some thoughts that came to mind during my own mental rewriteMost of this is information the audience can get throughout the story stuff you can use to highlight relationships and such in other scenes or just not all that relevant.Take Rowen being in the elf lands for instance.  Thats all that really needs to be conveyed in the scene.  Not why because the why doesnt matter to the other people present and its not the most important problem.  So while Senn is probably going to be pissed off about it hes not going to address it right then since the kingdom is under attack.But you can you can use the Why to show the dynamic between Senn and Rowan in a separate scene.  Senn wants to trust his sons judgment as Rowan is in line for the throne but the kids off wandering in Morzu?  Theres a fatherson argument for you blind duty seeing only what it wants to see versus the truth of what Rowan has seen with his own eyes.  Perhaps the sympathetic Mithayas overhears the argument but its something thats most likely going to happen away from the presence of the generals.Does it matter that the peace has lasted  years?  Probably not.  Just that its lasted a long time.  So this can just be implied by what people in the scene say.How about the bit about the human wizards creating the phantoms?  Probably worthwhile information but not here.  Thats a conversation for Mithayas and Senn to have offline because its not really relevant to the Generals or to Rowan at this point.  In fact its something that would probably happen after the initial scene where the King discusses the threat to the kingdom and the blow up with Rowan.  Mithayas can put the King at ease first mentioning his belief in Rowan. Emotional stuff done Senn can now refocus on practical stuff like the origin of the Phantoms.So following this approach your single three page scene is now three scenes covering maybe three to five pages.  Same amount of stuff going on but with more characterization possible.,Screenwriting,ck89tgi,1,t5_2qupf

1913051,0,t3_2giwl5,Hey so im not a produced bigshot screenwriter or anything but i do have a suggestion regarding networking or at least your phrasing here.Dont Network. I mean definitely find cool people in your field and industry and form mutually beneficial relationships with them but dont be a Networker. Networkers are people who look at every social interaction first and foremost as an opportunity to get someone to read their script or watch their short or whatever the fuck it is they think will make them famous. They make shitty small talk and ask you a few questions about yourself with an incredibly bored look on their face Then once theyve met the bare minimum of social interaction required to not be a stranger  they trade email addresses with you and move onto the next potential connection. Theyre shallow manipulative assholes and they infest this industry like locusts.Now looking over your post you dont seem like that at all  but understand that asking whos down to network? is a bit of a redflag. Its like walking up to a group of girls in a bar and saying so whos down to fuck? Even if thats your reason for being there  and even if thats their reason for being there  you shouldnt approach social interactions that way. Because youre not talking to a fleshlight youre talking to a human being. Same shit with networking dont dehumanize people into dollar signs.Again you seem chill so that last bit isnt really directed at you. But networking is brought up in this sub all the time and since so many people are terrible at it ive wanted to say this for a while. This just seemed like the best place for it.Anyway Im not in LA or else id go but I wish you guys the best.

Theres kind of a lot of controversy about what shows technically qualify for now in terms of awards and such example being Orange is the New Black being submitted as a comedy. If youre writing a straightup drama try to make it an hourlong because thats usually the standard for specs. A dramedy a show with elements of both comedy and drama can be either a halfhour or an hour long. Sitcoms and comedies are a halfhour because packing that many jokesperpage into an hour long script would be difficult for the writers every week. ,Screenwriting,ckvzy27,1,t5_2qupf

I dont agree with your take on the sub but case in point good things can come out of all sorts of posts.  Thats why the labels are so clear and colorcoded.  Edit also I think you need a writers group find one you like or organize one by your own ideal rules. I used to run a very disciplined one in the city a while back and it was everyone bring pages quality and criticism discussion only tight moderating of bullshit comments or rants keeping things constructive and moving. Optional hang out only happened off the clock for friendship beers networking and the things you seem jaded about. People might spend time on you or help you out in a real life for imperceptible subtle interpersonal reasons a whim affinity of personality an act of goodwill or networking a bid for connection or friendship or hell  you find them cute and want to talk to them more. That gray zone is important because theres meager marginal returns to reading amateur work.

Selfdoubt procrastination writers block etc. A lot of these are universal things theyre relatable topics.gtHow do I make the audience give a crap? The classic show dont tell applies. Someone mentioned addiction. You dont want to just have your protagonist go gee Id like to give in to my vice right now. It sure is hard not to!.Who cares? Why should we sympathize? How did they get this addiction in the first place? Use hints. Film is a visual medium use it. You dont have time to go into a whole backstory but you can suggest things. Maybe your protagonist has an acceptance letter from a good college on their desk or an award whatever. Next to it are some pills say adderrall. Think about these details. How do things relate? What does it say about your character? Your protagonist looks disheveled antsy hasnt eaten. Seeing the pills next to the awards shows your protagonist is an intelligent person. Maybe they felt too much pressure to be perfect took adderrall for a little boost and got hooked. Seeing them antsydisheveled shows the habit is getting out of hand. Students take adderrall to study more that your protagonist chose adderrall shows they are drivenmaybe obsessed with grades at the cost of their health. So being driven makes the audience like them. But maybe they are insecute about school and turned to adderrall for a boost? I could go on and on. This little display of the pills next to the awards says a lot about your character in little time. I could have easily elaborated on that little story and it all comes from one little shot. One little shot tells so much. You said a lot about your character without explicitly saying it.

2059357,0,t1_cl1kqwk,I think youre doing it. You just need to research and the ideas will come to you. Once you have those ideas laid down then you can determine what is and isnt working and what is and isnt cliche.I read a lot of nonfiction and crimedrama books myself. Im assuming youre going for a major city or larger metropolis type landscape if not thats even more of a unique foundation. I dont think it would hurt to read some books about the mafia racketeering extortion smalltime crooks petty criminals Higginss Boston mob books are fantastic and past criminal cases of robbers who were caught and their motives. Nine times out of ten it isnt just greed so that might help you come up with different ideas.For instance A man I read about  years ago through longform.org was robbing banks to pay for his alimony. What type of sad son of a bitch that entails is a character in itself.Without any material example all I can say is dont make them predictable constantly surprise and create some sort of ethics with each character. This will give you a lot to play with and most of all will not make them boring at the same time it will broaden the realism. And with realism comes honesty resulting in relatability from your audience.,Screenwriting,cl1l876,2,t5_2qupf

Presenting the conclusion you dont have to move to L.A. to break into the L.A.based industry that operates out of L.A. and is largely dependent on facetoface contact within L.A. is silly when your main argument is this international script listing for unproduced scripts often includes writers who are outside of L.A.Thats not a sound argument.

No matter how great the story and characters if you cant grab and hold a reader no one will know it. If youd been following this subreddit youd also know how bored readers are with scripts that open in someones bedroom with them waking up. Also the V.O. is always difficult to pull off.  I wonder if you might think about making that a conversation between your male and female characters and make it a little less onthenose in terms of stating your theme?  The V.O. then leads us to where they are.  It might even be that it sounds like a conversation but is really just the thoughts of two different people that when presented one after another gives the impression of conversation.One of my weaknesses is confusing my audience.

2668105,0,t3_2qjgk5,Humans think about goals in a whole bunch of different ways. Rejection andor failure are particularly hard to deal with when were focused on whats known as a performance goal. When youre picturing the excited email from a producer or the phone call from the big agent or announcement youve won first place in a screenwriting competition or your name in the credits onscreen youre focused on performance goals. Theres nothing wrong with this  in fact performance goals can be very motivating and push people to work extra hard. I unexpectedly achieved a performance goal a few weeks ago and holy crap it was the best. I had such an endorphin rush that I was physically shaking when it happened.The problem is that when someone with a performance goal hits a serious setback  like the straightA student who gets a C on an unexpectedly difficult exam  the goal becomes unattainable.  The streak has been broken and you cant get it back. In these situations motivation can typically vanish into thin air and getting it back can be difficult if not impossible. Psychologists who study motivation have found that individuals who pursue mastery goals do a lot better with these kinds of setbacks because theyre focused on getting better on improving their skills over time. For these people a C on a test says theyre weak in a particular area and need to put more effort on preparing for future exams. Its not a setback so much as useful information about what they should try to do differently in the future. Some mastery goals Ive set myself as a writer include Spending a set amount of time writing each day targeting one specific story issue in a draft and working on it until Ive found the best solution getting feedback from a trusted peer and addressing all their notes before looking for another reader reading or watching work by writers I admire or that tackle the same problems Im trying to fix in my own stuff then brainstorming ways to apply what Ive learned to my scripts. All of the above is summarized from the work of Prof. Heidi Grant Halvorson and her book Succeed. If you spend any time or energy doing creative work its a good idea to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of motivational psychology. A lot of what we call writers block is usually an involuntary reaction to environmental stimuli. When you understand how the human brain responds to stress discomfort perceived risks and potential gain it gets a lot easier to sit down in front of a blank page or  worse a complete shitpile of a script with no idea how to make it better and not freak out about how scary it feels. Other books in this vein Prof. Carol Dwecks Mindset and Prof. Daniel Kahnemans Thinking Fast and Slow. P.S. To give you some idea what a mastery goal looks like in action  my first entrylevel industry job was in  it took me   years to get my first professional writing assignment. Thats the thing about mastery goals  theyre often timeconsuming and theyre not especially glamorous. But if you stick with them you always see results in one form or another. ,Screenwriting,cn6uge8,8,t5_2qupf

In all likelihood there will be legal hurdles for them to even look at unsolicited stuff.There still some value in having a spec episode of something to show reps or producers who might be interested you in the future so I dont think having the script is bad but sending a script to a hot highly coveted BBC series that only gets to make six episodes in three years seems like a waste to me.Keep it as a spec or because it is anthology series distill it to something that is less than ten minutes make an amazing short and submit it to festivals.My two cents.,Screenwriting,cn9514e,5,t5_2qupf

2765654,0,t3_2rqv8u,You cant really compare it to napster. Napster got huge because it was a service that provided you with free professionally produced music. While the idea is nice this site is probably going to be filled with a lot of really terrible scripts. There might be some good ones in there as well but most wont be. In the about section they write New screenwriters have very little chance of being discovered no matter how brilliant their work might be.Well thats a bold claim. Im not sure its true though.  They also write This can also be frustrating for actors and film makers who wait for that special script that might catapult their careers.Doesnt work like that. Its extremely rare that anybody is catapulted into their careers by anything. The whole about section makes it sounds like these guys dont know the industry and dont know how movies are made. Id be interested in hearing what you guys have to say. Just doesnt sound like these guys have any idea about how the moviemaking world works. It seems to me they base their whole concept on some of the  misunderstandings that exist among aspiring screenwriters. Nevertheless I got curious and bought access to two scripts. Im not impressed. Both were amateurish. Exactly the kind of scripts youd expect from a site like this. Boring scenes nothings going on. Nothing to pull me in no drama no conflict. I read all  pages of one and the other one I couldnt get through. Sure the formatting was there lots of white space. Looked nice. But both were boring just plain boring. Might have been just those two scripts though. Maybe I got unlucky. The two excerpts I read does not make me want to check out the other scripts there. At least give me the first ten pages for free so I know what Im getting myself into. But Im not going to pay two dollars to check out if a script is worth my time. Its pretty easy to get your hands on scripts if you want to so why pay? Look at Hollywood. Companies get sent tons and tons of scripts. These scripts have usually already been through agents or managers. So theres already a filter in place there. They get readers to read them a second filter. Then the readers bring them the best ones. Why on earth would they go here and pay  dollars to read the first ten pages of scripts from somebody whos just somebody somewhere in the world? Sure there might be a good one there. But its going to take so much work and money to actually find them. This sounds like the project of somebody who thinks that the reason his script isnt getting made isnt because its bad but because theres something wrong with the system man! Fuck Hollywood! Right?

You tell them to get fucked then you slam the door in their face.This is largely due to your decision to put the twist on page  rather than on page .

2916596,0,t1_cnzketx,This is probably the most useful and least confusing way to do it. Remember your script isnt the movie its the first preproduction document and people will have to base other documents on it. If you have a story that takes place over different periods in the past you want to make it easy on production to set this up because you are writing in lots of money. This way the UPM can take a look at the script and be like ok we have X scenes in  Y scenes in  Z scense in  and N scenes in . So we will bring in all the s stuff week  the s stuff week  the s stuff week  and the  stuff week  or whatever and they know how long they need to rent the avocado green fridges for the art department at a glance. ,Screenwriting,cnzmi6v,1,t5_2qupf

2931882,0,t3_2tq83e,Youre thinking too much about Jaws.Dont get me wrong Jaws is perhaps the best movie of all time and itll be hard to make a movie about sharks and not draw comparisons  rightly or wrongly.That aside by framing the story you want to write in terms of unlike Jaws or like Jaws youre hamstringing yourself creatively. If at all possible forget about Jaws. In fact forget about shark attacks! Youve said you want to set the film in New England and that you love sharks. Good thats a solid foundation to build from. Look for a character that would spring from that setting and motivation. Perhaps an oceanographer who shares your love of sharks. Now find a problem for him to overcome. Perhaps the girl he loves really hates sharks. Dilemma hes just discovered a wounded shark in a bay and now he has to nurse it back to health while keeping it hidden from the people who want to kill it. Twist it eats the girl. Now thats a pretty terrible premise and it got worse as I went along but my point is that you should focus on the part of the subject that interests you. Say youre fascinated with shark mating rituals. What kind of a character would find herself in a position to witness those?Finally just to bring it back to Jaws for a moment if the protagonist of the movie had been the newspaper owner Meadows or the widow Kitner instead of the sheriff Brody the movie would have had a very different plot. If youre determined to make it the story of a shark attack in an Amitylike town try simply giving the protagonist a different job than sheriff and youll find yourself in a very different place by the end of the story.Good luck!,Screenwriting,co1d7om,4,t5_2qupf

3147740,0,t3_2w6rl1,There are two basic routes to getting on a TV show.  Three actually but the third one is very very hard.First way get a job as a writers assistant and work your way up.  Writers assistants are in the writers room taking notes handling paperwork proof reading distributing stuff etc.  This is a difficult job that requires a lot of organizational skills.  However youll be in the room.  Occasionally youll contribute.  Youll gave valuable experience and you may even get paired up with a writer to do a script if its a long season or if youve been there for a while.The second way would be to write an excellent script in the genre in which you want to work.  This could be original material probably best bet or it could be a script for an existing show but dont expect to be on that show based on this script.The third way would be to write an awesome script that gets bought as a pilot and made.

3179896,0,t1_corkpl8,okay cool. You say as much as I love writing  okay which way do you like to write? In novel form? Or in screenplays? You canshould write visually in eitherboth but usually writers lean more one way than the other in terms of the style. You can tell you story either way. One way may or may not lead to the other. I like that you have a film as a longterm goal but in the immediate I still say go with your gut and which way is a more passionate course for you. If youve been writing fiction for as long as youve been holding crayonspencils then stick with it! If youve always been drawn to writing skitsplaysdialogueheavy stuff then perhaps screenwriting is more logical. And Ill say this  even if youre more wired for novelsfiction you can still write visually and with immediacy and in the present tense on the page. Look at nearly any YA fiction  a lot of that is present tense and active like scripts. I will stick with my original gutreaction thought  unattach from outcome in this case your story becoming a film and just WRITE in whatever works for and suits you. Ready?

Reveal his true colors how he handles himself under immediate pressure.  This has the effect of jarring the audience and in fact making them even more interested in the character than they would have been if hed been active and dynamic from the beginning.  You can then continue to write passive scenes but the character will now be seen in a new light and have an edge.  A character who is secretly a violent psycho or a conniving coward under the guise of passive calm often actually makes a great protagonist.  It takes the everyman concept and turns it on its head forcing the audience to look at themselves as well.

Most action movies dial back character development in exchange for character building knowledge of the situation and then overcoming it. If its appropriate for your genre dont get nervous about it.,Screenwriting,cpmgeiq,4,t5_2qupf

3483127,0,t3_301732,I spoke with Lit Manager Scott Carr about this on the SampS podcast that we literally just uploaded today  We talked about querying  the best time to send if grammar counts following up protocol querying via Facebook etc.From previous conversations with reps I have to agree with others here that you might want to avoid sending it late night or on weekends.  Yes you might get more of their attention since youre probably the only one sending at that time but youre also running the risk of a quick delete if you disturb them cell phone mail alerts!.Id also avoid Monday as they have lots of meetings and their inboxes are usually full.Fridays are a mixed bag as many are very busy.  But a few have mentioned they do read queries on Fridays as they catch up on everything they didnt get to during the week and youll be on top of the pile.  Crap shoot really.The same with lunch.  Some say they actually read emails while waiting for their lunch partner so you have their attention.  But that too is very hit or miss.Generally speaking the best timesdays seem to be during business hours or just before TuesThurs with earlier being better generally.  But again you can have success on Mondays or Fridays but its a crap shoot.Across the board though they all say they hate being queried on Facebook so I would avoid it.Good luck!,Screenwriting,cppavhn,1,t5_2qupf

4294940,0,t1_cs9kbzs,Ill just quote this from another site since I cant say it any better gtLets start with the park itself. John Hammond is a billionaire philmisanthropist who decides he wants to leave the world with something magic. So he creates an amusement park that is not only not magic its suicidal for any man alive to step foot on it whos not Chuck Norris. gtA theme park whose theme is dinosaurs fully capable of killing anyone in a matter of seconds. Never mind that Hammond keeps a couple of the worlds best paleontologists in his pocket with funding and champagne he never considers consulting them BEFORE he makes his park and only afterwards to gloat about it.The paleontologists surprise surprise tell him his park is ridiculously dangerous and he has a hissy.gtBut that doesnt stop him from sending them off on a tour the very first tour not only when theres a HURRICANE on the way and theyre on a F! ISLAND but sends his OWN GRADCHILDREN along with them.gtAmong the people he invites for his big premier is a mathematician named Malcom. Malcom is such a genius he not only predicts the park will go haywire and everyone will die he also has the smarts to both go to the island and take the tour. Why? Because he wants to flirt with Satler who would rather dig through triceratops sh!t.All he does for the first half of the movie is smart aleckly remind everyone that hes already prophesied the parks collapse oblivious to the fact that hes in it and his attitude makes him a rather conspicuous dinosaur target.  gtNow a few words about Ingens corporate rivals. They couldnt have hired a more incompetent accomplice. A fat slob with a criminal past whom Hammond forgives but makes him pay by running the system pretty much all by himself. Because you know all Samuel L. Jackson is going to do is shout motherfucker a few times and whimsically remark They deserved to die and I hope they burn in hell when all hell breaks loose.gtThis company could have bought any of the geneticists and gotten the goods with little or no harm but they arrange an elaborate espionage whose key operative is a guy who low and behold f! it up so badly the very idea of a Dinosaur themed amusement park will from now on be associated with death and calamity. gtNow why the hell did Grant of all people even go on this fucking tour? He already knew that Hammond had cloned Velociraptors about which he knows more then anyone on the planet but most auspiciously that they have a tendency to disembowel their prey and eat them alive. He even has one of their claws to foreshadow that raptors will go primeval on any ass they happen to come across. One of his objections to the park is that we dont know how these animals will behave. Really? BULLSHIT. You know EXACTLY how theyll behave. He knows raptor hunting strategy well enough to have saved Muldoons life if hed bothered to tell him. His expertise on Tyrannosaur optics saves his life more than once and he keeps this specialized expertise now IMMENTLY PRACTICAL all to himself. The only reason I can think of is this. At some point Malcom makes a smart ass remark about paleontologists becoming extinct now that dinosaurs are alive and well. Grant resents this and decides to go on the tour hoping that the dinosaurs will eat a few people Malcom especially and thus usher in his new career as a forensic investigator specializing in homicide by dinosaur. Think not? He doesnt warn Malcom about the Tyrannosaurs fatal vision flaw until AFTER he makes an ass of himself trying to lure it with the flare like a kid at a rave.But yeah its a movie. ,Screenwriting,cs9rg1n,1,t5_2qupf

If you intend to post it again I will be looking forward to the rewrite as nothing that you described in the above comment transpired upon a reading of this first draft. Adjusting dialogue giving it some depth and actuality would help in that regard.Final piece of advice and take this more from someone who has lived the environment than someone who actually has validated expertise though I take some joy in knowing that what very little I have ever written has garnered nothing but high praise from professionals and established directors I know the one constant to be found of all great filmmakers and writers lies in their methodology to tackling format storytelling development. Every single great filmmaker has a unique style. You should remember that there are very few rules but though most of them are in place to avoid production companies headaches while reading you should feel free to be as inventive and descriptive as necessary in order for your story to BE and come across as your story. Dont be afraid to provide annotations or guide the reader if the concept is a highly metaphorical or complex one. Any one of Tarantinos scripts will be instructive in that regard as they are wildly different from the standard that production companies have grown accustomed to in that vein avoid any Nolan scripts excluding Memento they become exceedingly trite after a while. A personal recent favorite of mine is Rian Johnsons Looper Brick is also a great read he is exceptionally vivid in detailing how he intends for the story to be reflected on screen.,Screenwriting,csdbbl2,4,t5_2qupf

Id have honestly been completely fine with them just recycling that element as its not like most of the audience would remember or at least care if it was done successfully the second time.And you know whats funny? The communicating with raptors bullshit in JP was well bullshit. But in Jurassic World as insanely corny and impractical as it was Pratt and the Pratt Pack communicating or at least coordinating was entertaining. Believable? For most of the movie just believable enough. And by the end even with the Praptors basically befriending the humans it was entertaining.That said I think I felt more for the Praptors than anyone else in the film  besides the assistant. Her death was gratuitous and honestly undeserving IMO. Also was too predictable too early relative to the actual sequence. We as an audience were supposed to know what was coming but the fact that she didnt at all deserve it made it feel insidious on the writers behalf not the cinematic universes behalf.

Secondly try to turn things around in your head. Rather than view your countrys underdeveloped film industry as a problem view it as an opportunity! Nobodys making films in you country  that means that any film you make there will stand out just by virtue of being made there. Hollywood is really good at poaching talent from other countries. If you became the breakout filmmaker from NoWhereIstan Hollywood is going to come knocking on your door. Meanwhile NoWhereIstan is almost certainly friendlier to new talent than Hollywood is  because Hollywood is actively hostile to new talent. Places with no film industry are at worst indifferent and at best shockingly supporting because they WANT a film industry. You may have to do more. Youll probably have to learn to produce and direct andor partner with people who know how to do that. Nobodys going to drive a dump truck full of money up to your house.

Shed been great in auditions everything was aokay but when they started filming  she couldnt act for some reason.They had to change everything on the fly and in the editing room.

A lot of people working on the Bourne Ultimatum including Matt Damon thought it was going to turn out to be a crap movie but it didnt.

4588132,0,t3_3dm2g2,The old painful exposition by having one character tell another character a funny story about an incident in their shared past to demonstrate a longterm friendship thing.I saw it done just last night and it was funny how it stuck right out at me like it was lit up in pink neon. I was watching Run All Night and Liam Neesons character and Ed Harris character were sitting down talking and Harris character says indicating decades earlier when they were teenagers You remember the time when you and me and some random girls name and another random girls name were in here and you had random girl on that bed and I had other random girl on this bed and blah blah blah...And it was all obviously because the writer needed to establish that they had been good old pals for a very long time since in a few minutes Neesons character will be forced to shoot and kill Harris characters son because he Harris characters son was drawing down on his Neesons son and this will shatter their long term friendship and make them into enemies.Maybe the reason this one annoys me is because in real life if you wanted to make a point to an old friend that you were conscious and respectful of how long youd both been friends I think that rather than suddenly telling a story from way way back youd just say something like so how long have we been friends now...   years?I dont know it wasnt too bad... it was professionally written but it just stuck out at me and seemed awkward. I think its probably because Im starting to really be able to tune into the dialogue in films and see into the writers intenttechnique in real time. ,Screenwriting,ct8xjjk,1,t5_2qupf

And I cant tell you how many of these efforts have flashbacks or other structural choices that dont serve the story at all.Rather than worry about finding a unique way to structure a story most writers would be better served outlining to a known working structure.

In dialogue it helps if someones line is trailing off but I prefer to use the dash  if someone is interrupted. Theres not a whole lot of use in scene description because its something you use in prose for some sort of mysterious or longing effect.  and .. arent anything I believe.

Spend time on them get to know them and then youll find your scenes are more interesting. When you have decent characters the scene writes itself. It really does.I name parents in my scripts. Yours are stereoytypical right now. Even for the couple of lines you give them they should have something fun to throw out. Giving them names and full identities would help this.Basically work on your characters. Even your lead has little about him. Hes a blank canvas who seems to be charming when he needs to be elevator and reserved when he needs to be having shots.Similarly your budgetStifler needs more pazzazz.

Heres what the Federal Trade Commission says about thatAny company may on its own refuse to do business with another firm but an agreement among competitors not to do business with targeted individuals or businesses may be an illegal boycott especially if the group of competitors working together has market power. For instance a group boycott may used to implement an illegal pricefixing agreement. In this scenario the competitors agree not to do business with others except on agreedupon terms typically with the result of raising prices. An independent decision not to offer services at prevailing prices does not raise antitrust concerns but an agreement among competitors not to offer services at prevailing prices as a means of achieving an agreedupon and typically higher price does raise antitrust concerns.,Screenwriting,cug997j,1,t5_2qupf

At the time I was staying in The Philippines in the s. So I completely forgot about the context with regards to American society.Tension is lacking completely  everything sort of just happens. I felt that it was unconventional for horror and was attracted to the idea. I see now that I missed my mark. I wanted to really push this idea between being old and young. And I thought those whove died are in all age groups so there is bound to be restless spirits.

The spirits feel that grandpa being out of the picture means they can stay longer.Maybe horror is just an element? Upon reconsideration.

5137474,0,t3_3laasl,Ive read a ton of scripts lately and heres what Ive noticedIf a script is getting passed around or used as a professional sample it usually meets a certain level of competency of clarity pacing and storytelling. I understand whats happening on the page who the characters are what they want and how each beat reflects that  I never feel like the writer is wasting my time with something I dont really need to know and my experience of the story is being skillfully guided by the writer so I have moments of surprise delight outrage etc.When I LOVE a script want to meet the writer want other people to read it theres something else entirely going on. It has all of the above obviously. For lack of a better phrase the script pulls me into an almost tangible narrative dream compliments to John Gardner  I am there. I am looking at this world through the characters eyes I feel what the character feels I want what the character wants. And yet Im still surprised here and there given delightful moments where the writer has clearly thought about the story until they found a way forward I didnt see coming but makes perfect sense. The feature scripts Ive read over and over Chinatown Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Tootsie Lawrence of Arabia.TV pilots with the same qualities Breaking Bad Mad Men Good Wife Newsroom unproduced not the shot pilot Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Never having judged the final round of a contest I cant say for sure how these things get decided but personally a great script is great on its own terms. I cant honestly say that Chinatown is somehow better or worse than Lawrence of Arabia  one is a spoon one is a knife. A knife is worthless if youre trying to eat a bowl of bisque a spoon is no use when youre trying to cut a steak. Its been many years since I thought the Best Picture went to the objectively best movie of the year  all the nominees are outstanding and the Oscar goes to the one that at that moment emotionally connected with more Academy voters.

5192453,0,t1_cvbjhez,Very welcome. The podcast is excellent but the actual Creators Workshop is a thing to behold. Everyone uses their real name can ask questions in the various threads can post pages of artwork andor scripts for feedback from your peers.A few years back I posted a script for feedback  when one of Mark Millars regular editors came across it read the logline and then read the script based off of the intrigue. What followed was a critique of the script that offered areas of improvement areas that are quite strong and could possibly be expanded and a general reaction to the script. Which doesnt necessarily sound like much as a whole but for me it was eyeopening rewarding and gave me a narrower focus on how to improve the script and concept. It wasnt just someone that stumbled into a Reddit and offered advice it was professional advice from someone who edits one of the more famous pro writers out there. Which is an awesome experience.Coincidentally that is now the spec TV pilot Im writing. I want to see if it works in the TV medium as well as it did in the comics medium. So give the Workshop a try even for just one month. Its  per month. I get nothing from shilling this Im no longer a member but not for any reason other than no current comics being produced and Im only doing so from my absolute love for both the Creators Workshop as well as the industry. Im a writer and even reading through the Q amp A threads for the artists was eye opening  how to properly compose panels characters integrating perspective etc. So much professional experience is just sitting there waiting to be absorbed. If you join your entire first week will be simply soaking it in.As for Kickstarter definitely look at the ComixTribe articles by Tyler James on running Kickstarter  campaigns. Hes raised nearly  over various projects and goes into deep analysis of printing production costs unexpected costs so on and so forth. Its worth the read. Especially for the shipping section  which has bit some industry pros on occasion. look up the In The Dark Anthology and how Rachel Deering raised k but shipping costs put her thousands in debt unfortunatelyI wish you nothing but the best of luck. ,Screenwriting,cvbvtqy,1,t5_2qupf

I think people need to generally disabuse themselves of the notion that anyone and I do mean anyone regardless of their experience or stature in the industry is a godlike notes giver. And even if such a person exists you as a writer still need to implement their notes which is as much an art as writing the script in the first place. This idea that well I implemented the notes and the score didnt get better so the failure is on either the previous notes or the new evaluator indicates a laughable lack of selfawareness. Certainly well always be willing to look at the evaluations to make sure that a reader hasnt failed in their duties but the most likely explanation for this situation is that the notes were implemented poorly.,Screenwriting,cvez9dd,2,t5_2qupf

The derelict was originally another ship that landed or crashed and sent out the signal warning not to land because they found the pyramid as well and the alien inside.All the characters were male and had terrible names. Earth was called Irth for some reason. And the end of the film happens similarly except that there is an alien pod on the outside of the lifepod called Snark  seriously bad names leaving a cliffhanger.When you watch documentaries on the Alien franchise Dan OBannon would always comment on how he hated the changes Giler and Hill made to his script proclaiming that they were making his masterpiece worse with each draft... but if they had made the script as he had written it I would not be talking about the film right now because it would be largely forgotten.

5607665,0,t3_3qkxye,I could have written this except for the methodical part. Im . Have made a good living in IT. Parts of it are a lot of fun parts of it are droll. Mostly I resent having to spend so much of my life doing whats important to someone else. Other than that it could be much worse. Have suffered from anxiety since a child depression since adolescence. However I also  have ADD because depression usually comes with friends so that has made planning and execution very difficult. Im not going to say impossible because I believe I need to kick myself in my own ass but it has been difficult.I have three scripts in progress one I started a decade ago thats still unfinished.I also fear the potential dreadful conclusion of what are currently my now perfect but mostly unwritten scripts. And if youre like me and you might at least partially be the issue is perfection. You have a plan. You think by planning you will be perfect or you at least want to be. Know that I am certainly no further along in my path than you are. In fact I am probably behind. However I recently saw an amazing interview with Elizabeth Gilbert who had a very interesting take on creativity. In summary she noted that creativity comes from a relatively new part of the brain. Your anxiety obviously originates from one of the oldest parts of the brain.The oldest part of your brain  the parts that control fear anxiety and response  dont understand creativity. You can invite those parts along for the trip but they will not understand your creativity and they will attempt to shut down your creative choices one by one. You cant let that part of your brain have any say over your creativity. She inferred that as a result you have to let your creativity have fun without the stress of making it support you and support the other structured part of your life because she has seen so many people just crash and burn creatively as a result of trying to do this.The contract she made with writing was that she would never ask her writing to support her financially. She would support them both. She would do whatever she needed to do to pay the rent and then she and her writing would have a love affair on the side that wasnt contingent on monetizing that love. Maybe thats a better place to start from  to just cultivate your love affair with writing ONLY  and perhaps free from the pressurefear of it supporting your regular life your creativity can begin to unstick itself?If you want to see the video just do a YouTube search for Elizabeth Gilbert and Marie Forleo.Good luck. ,Screenwriting,cws6obp,1,t5_2qupf

It seems like something that would be both comedic and heartfelt. Especially if in later seasons you took it beyond that high school reunion.

5718128,0,t1_cx5j492,Underlining a single word here and there is fine. In fact you first underline is almost an example of when its very useful. Theres a difference between how that line reads if you think we or did is emphasized. Underlining were in you were there is weirder. It actually threw me. While I eventually got what youre going for emphasizing the idea of were vs the idea of werent it actually feels on first read that its emphasizing the pasttense of it. This line would therefore probably work better without it. eg You were there clearly means you as opposed to someone else was there. You were there means that you were at the location were talking about not somewhere else. But You were there is trickier. It could mean werewerent or it could be wereare. And the third underline you in why do you think we broke up is tricky for another reason it makes the line read much more antagonistically which breaks up the flow and feels out of synch with the rest of Toms dialog  because hes not being antagonistic there.Theres a tendency with underlines or bolds to have that word turned up to  in peoples heads when they read it and in these latter cases that causes weird problems. We dont have that feeling when we write it because So I might cut two of them not because underlining is wrong but because youve made choices that are maybe not great about which words to underline. ,Screenwriting,cx5w1mf,1,t5_2qupf

Setting up the adventure usually sets up the crucible too.Sometimes the crucible can have more than one aspect.

5783616,0,t1_cxdzqnx,Curious if youre watching them on screen or at home?I think his films really benefit from seeing them at a theater. Ive noticed that I really loved the ones I first saw on screen and have been more ambivalent about most of them that I saw first at home.That being said both To The Wonder and The Three of Life are among my favorite films so I can try to talk about why I like them. Its important in my opinion to recognize that they are largely not primarily narrative films but rather experiential ones. I would say this is true of the best parts of The New World too. It is therefore important to actually pay attention  you have to let the movie wash over you. If you are watching them at home you have to ignore your phone ignore the laptop turn off the lights and just watch the film. This is challenging for some people because the films are slow  again because theyre not really about the narrative which makes them different from almost every other film youve seen in your life. But if you dont surrender yourself to the spell of the film theyre simply not going to work. The Tree of Life in my opinion is a profound argument about what God is. But it doesnt make that argument narratively the way were used to. It does so experientially  by drawing you into what the experience of godhood is in a very specific way. As such if you give yourself over to it its almost an ecstatic experience in such that you see the beauty and interconnectedness of all parts of life. To The Wonder works similarly about the experience of romantic love. It is impressionistically capturing the totality of that experience. In both films the logic is the storytelling reminds me somewhat of an ecstatic meditative trance or for some people perhaps a spiritual mushroom trip. That is to say it is perfectly true and perfectly selfconsistent but in a way that bypasses the logical leftbrain processes through which we typically experience and analyze the world. You say that theyre difficult to grasp and I understand and agree with that  but I would say that the problem is that youre attempting to grasp them rather than just to experience them. Let go your leftbrain tendencies to control and understand and compartmentalize and just allow them to unspool. Thats hard for a lot of people. Our culture prioritizes the intellectual over the experiential. If you dont have practice meditating you will probably struggle with your conscious minds desire for something more specific to chew on for a clear narrative to distract it and so youll start asking questions and thinking rather than just experiencing. But if you can let go of that the rewards are tremendous. ,Screenwriting,cxe0gvb,4,t5_2qupf

You glossed over some powerful topics and struggles and conflicts that can draw the audience in through their own experience and struggles such as Atheismfaith.

Clairs temptation This could be a great source of inner conflict. Tap more into the betrayal that Paul feels.smoking is this a tool to show they are bad parents or a feeling of hopelessness or struggling with overcoming problems? Where is the resolution? Pauls job loss people find their identity in their career and he has none. Why did he lose his job? It this part of what this character needs to learn? Does this establish a shortcomming that finds resolution? This is a great source for Pauls inner conflict. Why have him work at Home Depot? Why not have him pursue art? Warlock stuff Why is Parker into this? Is he escaping from stress at home or school? Is this a sign of autism? Is he a budding Satanist because of his Dads Atheism? Is he finding a personal identity in it?    . If this is a family drama then you need to cut out the swearing and pot use. I imagine it will have a broader appeal as a family drama. It doesnt have to be squeaky clean but write for that audience if that is the audience you want.    Summary Dont be upset but I think you have a potato.

Theres always a new approach always a new person waiting just around the corner  the perfect match for your pilot or feature  fate just hasnt put you together yet. You find one person like that befriend them move on to the next person. Then the next. And I mean actually befriend them none of this bullshit where you smile at them get their card and email them your script and expect them to get back to you without learning anything more about them than their shoe size. You know their birthdays you know their kids birthdays you know when theyre feeling sad or pissed off or defeated just like you and you offer to buy them a drink when they are. Misery loves company and even the most successful members of this industry suffer defeat and disappointment and human emotions just like anybody else. Appeal to that.Suddenly you have a coalition around you all its members shouting your name from the mountaintops. The key is opening up the opportunities for that to happen. Make talent or producers regret that they took so long to read your material or push your agenda properly. While youre writing and waiting for whoever needs to read your shit to read your shit youre also pitching your newest project  meeting the person whos gonna give your manager a run for hisher money  doing whatever it takes to MAKE them think of you regularly.

Two pages of excruciating boring details about food and the weather before the conversation starts?And it actually goes downhill from there. The conversation about friendship has absolutely no tension. Both guys are passive. Nothing said affects the other person. Everyone agrees. Lets it drop. Nobody asks the tough question. No one is forced to reconsider or confront. Absolutely no conflict.And most of the questions are not even questions. Theyre statements with a question mark where the period goes. Theyre actually anticipatory answers. Because the response can only be yes. Go back and read every question that doesnt begin with What When Why etc. These have only yes or no answers. Your characters are helping each other dodge all the real questions.Using real life conversations between your friends as a model for screenplay dialogue is always going to be a disaster. Unless your friends are brilliant witty and charismatic. Im sorry if this is from real life they are not. Almost no one is. But you have to somehow create that for every character.

6614930,0,t3_46a132,These are all generalizations based off my experience so take with a grain of salt...Actors read a script looking for juicy parts to play for themselves. They look for those character moments when they can flex their acting muscles. A powerful emotional moment. A cool bad ass moment. Interesting dialogue exchanges with other characters. Ive found theyre a little less focused on the story.Producers are bigger picture. Ive found they are really good at seeing storycharacter arcs. And they seem to really be aware of pacing. This section drags. You need to get to this point quicker. They basically try to imagine how an audience would react.They definitely always keep an eye out for budget. Can you move that night scene in a crowded area to daytime indoors? Cause nighttime shoots are expensive and they dont want to pay for extras.I havent worked with many directors. But my experience has been they definitely have this idea in their head of the story they want to tell. In that way they are like writers. But its a very distinct vision that could clash with the writers. And like actors they are looking for spots where they can push their abilities. They might get sold on even one really cool set piece that they just have to shoot. Can I make this movie look cool? seems to be on their mind alot.Anyway thats what Ive found. Others Im sure will chime in with their experiences.,Screenwriting,d03jgbx,2,t5_2qupf
6615679,0,t3_46anwx,Ug. No. Stop.Yes you should outline more. But no that outline shouldnt be about this savethecat shit. Heres what you should doPick five movies that are similar in genre and tone to what youre trying to write and outline them. Dont at this stage try to fit them into a beat sheet. Just outline them. I usually watch a movie twice to outline it. First all the way through and then with my finger on the pause button making a ton of notes. Once youve done that WITH A BUNCH OF FILMS and noticed a bunch of stuff on your own feel free to compare what you came up with to the various beat sheets you can find out there. Notice the ways the beat sheet fits and the ways it doesnt. Notice when you sort of have to stretch the definition of a section on the beat sheet to make it fit. Now outline your movie not by trying to fill in predetermined beats but by applying what you understand about story and creating causallyconnected compelling original scenes and finding ways to tie them together. If reading somebodys beat sheet helps you think about your story in different ways and prods your imagination great. But dont be a slave to it because as you probably noticed when you broke down five movies lots of great movies dont fit beat sheets. And in fact the more specific the beats on your beat sheets are the less well they fit most movies. Even just those beats you already linked to already dont apply to lots and lots of movies  all youre doing by prioritizing a beat sheet over content is straightjacketing your imagination in the shape of the most cliched possible choices. Dont do it. ,Screenwriting,d03m8tw,6,t5_2qupf

Whats the pay off of using that particular device?It takes half the script to get anywhere near a horror film trope and to start the story. You could cut ALL the pages with banter between your characters AKA the first  pages. It builds towards nothing and makes me hate all of them.A short needs to dive into the story immediately. Believe it or not people have less patience for short films than for features. If it doesnt grab us right away well turn it off.There is nothing interesting or unique about the script. Youre right the ending feels rushed because there is no setup no arc no pay off. These stupid kids die stupidly. The end. Give us one character we can latch onto and give a crap about.

True it may be a deterrent or a sign of a underdeveloped lazy or uncaring author. However most authors are humans. Humans have this annoying propensity for error. Typos are extremely common even by the most revered authors. Story is the most important element! Period. Notice the spelling was addressed last not first. gtAlso another pass should be made for typos and formatting as it risks sending the wrong message about the quality of the writing.Its a risk not an absolute deterrent. I know this diatribe may sound like a dummys redundancy but I feel so much attention is placed on these two aspects grammar and spelling that the plot dialogue character arcs etc... can fall by the wayside. In fact I would argue it matters very little if the tone and the story are there.

These dont even have to be very large or obvious. Some obvious examples might be the detective once dated the victims sister or friend or even the victim herself and it ended badly. Or the people he interviews have something to hide  alleged abuse criminal pasts maybe something the detective knows about or has a stake in. Could be the whole town has interest in making this go away tourist season whatever and it might benefit the detective to clear the case with the quickness. Maybe even the victim had a history of less than stellar mental health.

6982734,0,t1_d17kdof, Very interesting about students and iPads. Most writers and readers I know myself included prefer it to reading on their computer. Hence the popularity of Weekend Read. May be a generational thing. From the writers perspective. I would like to see the number of notes right on on my scripts card. Consider putting it along with the likes.. Its not terribly convenient to have to scroll through the script looking for notes. What I would appreciate is a compiled list of all notes in order. Each entry would include the readers name the associated text and the note itself. Bonus points if this digest can be filtered by reader. From the readers perspective. Genre is the first thing I look at when deciding whether or not to read. Should be right below the title more important than author.. When I give notes specific inline comments are only one part of my feedback. I spend at least as much effort providing broad comments on theme story plot characters etc. Id really like it if the sidebar real estate was better utilized and allowed me to leave overall notes for the writer. Bonus points if it is organized into sections to encourage more thoughtful feedback. Design notes. Overall I really like the clean design but its actually so spartan as to be a bit offputting. This applies most the home page which hits the user like a cold shower. . Consider a contrasting color for the background of the top navutility bar. Dark grey for example.. It seems arbitrary which links are on the main list vs tucked away behind the account icon. For example why are my scripts hidden away but my notifications are displayed like a main section? A little time spent thinking about information architecture could yield real benefits and lay a more solid foundation for future expansion.. The circle next to the title on a scripts card is a needless flourish that doesnt help draw attention to the title. Its just noise.. Id really reconsider the fontweight of the script title. Typefaces come loaded with personality and especially on a spartan type driven design like this they really color the users perception. The current title font is too circus poster fun. Also consider the minimum contrast required. The title is big. Does it need to be big AND bold? Probably not.. The note icon needs much more contrast. Something like a yellow postit note. Needs to standout when quickly scanning.,Screenwriting,d17tyom,1,t5_2qupf

7335466,1,t3_4ftv6t,As a college graduate myself who has completed some graduate work I am agnostic when it comes to the benefits of college especially if that college education comes with a crushing financial burden that may take decades to pay off.I graduated from a large research university and my professors were NOT professional teachers. They were researchers. The ability to write a research paper that is wellreviewed by your peers in academic journals does not necessarily make one a great teacher. I had more than a few BRILLIANT professors who were not conversant in English which makes learning higher level mathematics a bit more difficult to say the least.  While I agree there is immense value in learning and exposing oneself to new ideas people cultures and ways of thinking I disagree that college is still the best place for that. What does it say when a comedian like Chris Rock refuses to perform at colleges? Quoted from a  interviewWell I love Bill Maher but I stopped playing colleges and the reason is because theyre way too conservative. Not in their political views  not like theyre voting Republican  but in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody. Kids raised on a culture of Were not going to keep score in the game because we dont want anybody to lose. Or just ignoring race to a fault. You cant say the black kid over there. No its the guy with the red shoes. You cant even be offensive on your way to being inoffensive. Please dont take my post as being antiintellectual or antilearning. I believe its important for screenwriters to be inquisitive to be wellread and to learn something new every day.

Consider expanding the initial interview. Disclosing information like the violent death of a loved one in an unsolved murder case is difficult. The revelation deserves to be earned. The more we begin to suspect Jacks intentions the greater the suspense. Expanding the scene will also make Theodores deconstruction of Jack in the KILL ROOM less surprising. As it is now hes gained an incredible amount of insight from very little. This reversal in power too needs to be earned. Technical noteYou have Theodore and Jack exchange names twice.

Haunting echoey mystical chanting. The hooded figures turn in unison and leave. A chilling scream from the old barn.Next day the barn is burned down stripper is missing. The alter is untouched.Ill leave the rest of the story for later.Up until here you basically just have to find a burned down barn somewhere and a not burned down barn to film in. Cheap cloaks with hoods are easy to find and cheap Halloween outfits. The outside shot of the not burned down barn is computer generated barns are simple enough to be cheap superimpose it on outside shots of the burn out.You could get act  done for under k easy.A heist film could be done in budget. Forget the car chases. The crew uses mountain bikes. Half the movie could be shot on a GoPro. A few smart changes of clothes Halloween masks during the heist. Use stunt riders as your actors shoot in order in case something happens to one of them.At k a lot of your film will be camera work.

Yes so youve said. But that isnt the problem youre facing.  The problem youre facing is that you dont understand process and you just wrote what is essentially a lot of boring scenes. You must know that or you wouldnt be here.  If the best you can come up with to express your vision isgtPause on Dave... His face analyzing the pitch data. He clicks the mouse then scratches his arm. He frowns but continues with his work. You need to do something to improve your writing skills. The other problem is I think you really believe thisgtNow the audience knows something is wrong. They know its not just an innocent scratch ...No they dont.  How would they know that? Are you saying that in some previous scene we saw an alien bug crawl under his skin? gtthe point of the scenes being drawn out is they create anticipation. Well no. Those kinds of scenes create dramatic tension when they are wellcrafted. Brilliantly edited. Again unless you are the filmmaker you have to create all that on the page. You need to find a few scripts that do what you want to do that werent written by the directors and see how the writers handled it.

I think that they were still really good however I want to take on the challenge of writing a dramatic character driven story that derives from the depositions of the characters rather than their situation. I feel like you can create a great story doing both however I believe its more challenging to write a character driven story. At least for me it is. It is really hard for me to develop characters and push them in a clear direction. It is something that I am working on.

7939941,0,t1_d48ik6a,I understand film is a visual medium my day job is as a Camera Operator so trust me there... The problem with getting this story across is that both the overarching protagonist Victor... not Vincent is literally a voice in a computer which Sari does encounter later in the script and the overarching antagonist Singularity operates both through militarygrade hardware and the thousands of human bodies it occupies hive mind like the Borg except they look no different than others except for their levels of refinement be it physical fitness grooming or both.In those first  pages Victor is telepathically communicating with Sari and she responds out loud each time it tells her something. Though when shes captured by the Outsiders that wireless transmission capability is cut off thus rendering Sari completely on her own for the majority of the film. Sari was sent into the world as she describes to her captors via dialogue to have a conversation with whatever showed up in the crashed space ship. That was the only directive she was given before her communication was cut off. She is then thrown into an adventure and experiences humanity in a way she never knew because shes essentially a testtube baby born at the equivalent of  years old and very quickly loses her naivet.

8025029,0,t3_4p4tae,Ive always loved James Camerons take the best. The first Sam Raimi one actually used many elements of Camerons scriptment most notably the organic web shooters. However Raimis version in my eyes was horrible. The opening origin for some minutes were okay although I never liked the Tobey Maguire casting.  in my opinion was vastly overrated and  was just a mess. I longed for Camerons take. His two villains were written far better than anything weve seen from any SpiderMan movie thus far. And Cameron likely would have relied less on CG... or the CG would have been more groundbreaking. Raimis SpiderMan was a perfect example of subpar CG that was overtly evident every time you saw SpiderMan doing something in the air etc.Camerons would have truly been groundbreaking. Sadly due to the rights owners going bankrupt and the various rights issues of the character in the s Cameron had to walk away. As far as the idea of scriptments go theyre nothing more than a tool to use. I like them better than treatments because youre give the broad strokes of what the script would be accompanied by the filling in of the blanks in treatment style. But its not something you can ever use to sell a concept. Hollywood wants the script plain and simple. You may be asked to use a treatment or script for an assignment to convey your take but for the most part scriptments are just cool tools for the writer to lay things out.  ,Screenwriting,d4i373o,0,t5_2qupf

But thats very different than saying you didnt bother to check for spelling grammar or formatting.  What I read and hopefully Im wrong about this is that you didnt read through it once for errors before throwing it out there.  If you are proud of your draft enough to share it why on earth would you not want to run through it a couple times to make sure it doesnt look sloppy?  If youre not that proud of your draft why are you putting it out there halfbaked?  Your thoughts may be something along the lines of its an early draft it doesnt it matter whether I proof it.  The reason is because most people myself included have a LOT to chose from when they read.  I clicked your post skimmed and thought it sounded interesting.  Then saw your comment that read to me as I havent proofed it and I moved on without opening it.  And the disclaimer is not the issue  if I open something and its clear on the first page that there was no effort to proof it even once Im moving on.  That may not matter to you and you may be saying whatever I have other people who are reading and commenting.  But why wouldnt you want to have as many people as possible providing feedback?  Instead of having some see what appears of a lack of commitment to your own script and move on.  ,Screenwriting,d73czq9,1,t5_2qupf

8798373,0,t3_50jsuz,Hey there! The idea is good and it isnt confusing well the monsters dream at the sink was!. The one problem I have is that the majority of the script is the monster standing around explaining everything or prompting flashbacks to explain it. Half the script is basically exposition. Go even more minimal.I like the opening and how it wraps back around at the end to the voice message  thats a good framing device for the plot but Id just cut back in time and show all these things through flashback immediately after that cold open. Leave us guessing... the audience will figure it out. I think it would build more tension and more mystery this way. There is really no reason to have the Monster stand there and explain everything to Derrick in the room for the majority of the film  just show us those scenes instead. Why not just give us a glimpse of him tied up in the room have Kat say I did this because I love you and BAM  go into Derrick and Drew in the woods as teenagers. Parse it out from there. A lot of the dialog is kind of stiff and since its almost all expository it comes off a little awkward in quite a few instances  getting rid of the commentary in between flashbacks youd make it a much more intriguing film. Less dialog can be more especially when you want to build dread. Other thoughtsYour first three scenes start with your protagonist waking up. Seems a bit much. Im not sure why hes asleep again when we return to the basement for the first time. It adds nothing so Id remove it that is if you dont want to change the whole structure like I suggested above of course!. I would start that third scene with Kats line I did this because I love you. Puts a bit of a chill in the air. Also in that third scene all the wrylyies you have for Derricks dialog are kind of pointless and implied in the context of the conversation so Id remove those as well.Id also remove all the dissolve to transitions. Personally I think a cut would work better cinematically and just changing sluglines will be more effectiveless distracting for the script. deusche bag should be douchebag breathe in your dialog and near the end in an action line should be breath.In summation I think you could make this into a nice tight little horror piece if youre willing to go in and dismantle the structure youre currently forcing on it. This is all one mans opinion so take it or leave it. Go with your gut and write the script YOU want to write. Good luck!,Screenwriting,d75g02x,1,t5_2qupf

9293879,0,t3_57pv65,Maybe start writing the kind of story youd normally tell and then at about the  minute mark the protagonist suddenly becomes selfaware and cognisant of whatever plot the antagonist is launching at them. Maybe they even realise theyre in a movie. Maybe they can tell the future. Its not important. Theyve somehow gotta plan prepare and implement a way out of their predicament before it even starts and maybe theyll take the story into another genre completely just to get away.Its not a serious suggestion  in fact its kinda corny  but it forces you to think of what someone with perfect knowledge would do in the movie youve planted them in. How would they get out? And then  the important part  follow through on those actions rather than find excuses for them to get back to the plot you want. See where you go.The idea is that it gets you thinking.I once wrote a feature about Not Lois Lane who realizes about halfway through the movie that Not Superman actually isnt a misunderstood romantic softhearted goody two shoes like in the comic books and is actually a psycho gone mad with power and she must actively find a way to stop Not Superman before he destroys the entire city. It wasnt a particularly well written movie but it was a lot of fun to play with the genre conventions and do a totally new take on the Lois LaneSuperman relationship. It was also written around the same time as the last Twilight movie was coming out so that was also a huge influence what if Bella took literally five seconds to objectively examine her relationship with Edward?

Intercut works fine the vast majority of the time and could work well here if you use really tight succint action lines as the second character moves between locations. But if you want to dwell a little in each location with multiple action lines then I would use separate sluglines and make it obvious the conversation is ongoing and the action is continuous. ,Screenwriting,d9w98s2,2,t5_2qupf

Great work making it strike the tone of those movies! I thing you captured moving around a city well and the romance of being in an unfamiliar city. I would say that the relationship discussionreveal felt a little flat to me...I didnt feel super invested. Is there something that could have driven them apart more than just drifting apart? Could they almost cut their evening short only to have one of them convince the other to continue hanging out? I could use a little more intrigue a little more tension.

I absolutely agree with you that Grindelwald was really just used to set up tensions and explain why people are so on edge especially in New York but I felt like there was no tension at all even with the setup.  And while the act of catching all these magical creatures is a pretty interesting concept and played out decently in some scenes I dont think it was interesting enough to warrant that being the basis of the movieeven if thats what gives the flick its namesake.  Plus them catching the magical creatures in secret was completely dependent on there being some andor any kind of tensionwhich again in my opinion there wasnt.,Screenwriting,da9mq8i,2,t5_2qupf

I hope youre not filming this anytime soon. since its winter. Itd be better to take it out unless again there is some significance to it. A nervous young man stands awkwardly across the street. He is pacing back and forth trying to convince himself of something. His hair is combed and hes gripping a bouquet of flowers. Is he standing awkwardly or pacing? I advice pacing considering that standing awkwardly is not something people do. Also make sure we understand that hes been watching her otherwise we dont know that its the the perfect opportunity.He runs his fingers through his hair. This is usually something people do when theyre stressed. Trying taking a deep breath instead? I dont know something else. He has his hair combed after all. Hes shocked. Confused. Scared. Are you just going to have him stand around looking shocked confused and scared? He should actually be doing something at this time like trying to shake his body or reenter it or SOMETHING. Also Im surprised that the girl just left after witnessing someone being run over by a car. Make sure you have the truck driver have like a small panic or something before ditching Lucass corpse. Right now in the script he just leaves and then sees the flowers floating. Keep in mind he also needs a reason to turn around. He smiles and starts to walk away... I dont think this is the honest reaction. I imagine him being more determined to get this girl but not really smiling.The part where she gets banned... for having books levitate behind her? Make it clear that it looks like shes doing it otherwise it doesnt work. Why is he eating ghost chips? Where did he get these ghost chips? I get that its a joke but... what? I like the idea of him looking angry at Matthew for being a cunt and stealing his girl but try to find a different way. creak! Okay please build this up more. The audience has seen the shadows moving around from an invisible ghost? But for Matthew all he has witnessed was something creaking. That isnt enough to scare anyone. On scaring Matthew Lucas is kinda being a dick without repercussions isnt he? Also why can he make himself visible when hes scaring people but not when hes trying to get with the girl? How did he know he could make himself visible? Youve already shown that floating things freak people out. Why not make things float again? Then after hes done being a dick why is his next emotion being defeated? I would understand if he had been actually trying to get her attention but the last thing he did was scare off some dude. Also the flowerbed has HIS name on it? Thats weird dude. No one would do that. Even if you were dead and you were trying to say its from you. You would put the name of the person youre sending it to. And also we never learned his name so itd be weird seeing the name Lucas on the flowerbed unless youve read the script. The ending. Hm. The flowers. If you were a girl and you just saw some guy had arranged flowers for you right after you died would that be your reaction? Also its KINDA his fault she died isnt it? Id be fucking PISSED. Now if he had made a real effort to save her right before she died? That would be different. ,Screenwriting,dael8uj,5,t5_2qupf

9839743,0,t3_5g2d65,Couple things. Youre in New York youre in film school and you love TV. I have no idea where youre going but I applied to NYU and Columbia with Buffy spec in  amp  and got NOWHERE. Maybe its changed since then but I found the only school that took television seriously was USC. Or maybe thats just a convenient lie I tell myself since its the only place I got in. So part of the challenge you might be facing  without knowing it  is that youre at a school that has an institutional bias towards film and away from television.. I used to live in Chicago at a time when improv comedy and experimental theater were the primary creative outlets. Moving to LA and living in a city where there are a TON of fellow aspiring TV writers has been a godsend for me. Now of course like six shows shoot in Chicago but this was a while back. I assume youll stay out east until you finish your degree but just know Its a whole different vibe in LA.. I applied repeatedly to the various fellowship programs without success. So I focused on working my way up as an assistant. It took a LONG time  six years before I got a freelance closer to eight before I became a full time writer. However if your program is as filmcentric as I suspect you may not be aware they exist at all so do definitely look into the CBS Diversity Program ABCDisney and NBC Writers on the Verge. All three like candidates whove gotten their feet wet in the industry already so if you can manage to swing an internship at an NYCbased agency that will help. Also if youre in school the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences the Emmy people place a small number of interns on TV shows each spring  now would be an ideal time to start working on your application. . When youre ready both Sundance and the Humanitas people are actively looking for new unconventional writers. So work on your samples and keep an eye on the deadlines. I hope all of that wasnt too advicey. Once upon a time I was in my living room staring at my TV set because an alum from my college had a writing credit on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I thought HOW?!? How does a guy from the University of Wisconsin end up in FREAKING HOLLYWOOD writing a TV show? And next Wednesday Ill be sharing writing credit with my boss on the secondtolastever episode of Rectify on the Sundance Channel  my fourth produced credit! So there is always hope. ,Screenwriting,daq53yu,2,t5_2qupf

9890263,0,t3_5gwimz,I got feedback of widely varying quality. One feature script feedback was prety indepth had a lot of details was about  words long. Then I got feedback on a different feature that was maybe  short sentences with vague statements and the only thing thats explored in more detail than a single quick sentence is to wonder aloud if one element is in poor taste its not. I submitted a short. A page short. See if you can spot the problem with the feedbackgtWould like to see more exploration into him as a person and where that could really go...On the final page the story merely stops and its uncertain if thats the end or if its unfinished.The story doest just stop it pretty clearly wraps up but its a page short. It reads like this person was expecting a page script or something and before you say well maybe your ending sucked and they didnt get that it was an ending this script has previously placed pretty high in a short contest. And I also had comments on two different features that they didnt like that the guy got the girl at the end. In both scripts Im doing something a little unique with the standard guy gets girl trope and in both cases the relationship stuff is a minor subplot and in both I put some thought and some unique ideas into why they would hook up by the end rather than just doing the standard Hollywood brainless version of it. Both comments said something about how the female characters had expressed that they didnt like the male character so it seems unrealistic or forced to have them like the male character by the end. Im just... have you guys seen movies before? If they both like each other from the beginning then thats incredibly boring they need to have a dynamic relationship. One said it becomes very unrealistic since Lexi has shown negative interest in Murdock. For her to suddenly be in love and down to sleep with him feels like what the writer wants to happen and not what the story would actually have happen realistically... Its a distractingly gross thing to do to a character. It think they found some readers that are obsessed with female agency tumblr feminism type stuff. Also that reader called guy likes girl girl doesnt like guy at first later on as they go on adventure together girl starts liking guy unrealistic in a script in which the CIA is making clones of famous people using LSD to control people faked the moon landing and other wacky conspiracy things yet the one thing that was said to be unrealistic was that the girl went from not liking him to later liking him. ,Screenwriting,dawq2yq,2,t5_2qupf

Just shred it into tiny little pieces then tear those into even smaller pieces and them throw them all over the floor and laugh.Because then you can begin picking the pieces up and putting them back together. Better.And sometimes you might disagree. If you do thats fine you cant please everyone and by making the best story for you at least youre pleasing someone. But by having it torn apart and putting it back together and having it torn apart and putting it back together a hundred times over only then can you make those pieces into the very best story they can build.Live for those criticisms.,Screenwriting,dc0axb6,1,t5_2qupf

10295782,0,t1_dcardiw,As long as you dont run a studio or network theres no reason why you should care. You like what you like you watch what you want no harm no foul.But the problem is that implicit bias affects us all  viewers producers and executives alike. Let me be clear Implicit bias is NOT the same thing as bigotry or explicit bias. IB isnt anyones fault and it doesnt even necessarily mean that anyone is deliberately trying to discriminate. Humans are just cognitively hardwired to show preference for the familiar. Since white men were  and are  the primary decision makers at the studio and network level it is not surprising to see that white men are REALLY overrepresented among working TV and film writers.Programs like this are designed to work against implicit bias by funneling good writers  who are diverse  into the kind of opportunities that historically have gone overwhelmingly to white men. Exactly how overrepresented are white men? The WGAs  report  which tracks  numbers  shows Total writers employed in  Women writers employed in  or  in TV  in film Minority writers employed in   or  in TV  in filmAs of   of all writing jobs were held by men and  were held by white writers. Those numbers clearly dont match the general population and they havent matched  or come close to matching  the general population in decades.And this is WITH the handful of diversity programs that the studios have been running for at least the last ten years. Clearly its not the case that for example the ABCDisney fellowship has magically transformed the industry into a diverse utopia.So much to say The HBO program isnt meant to encourage crappybutdiverse writers. Its meant to find and nurture the writers who are falling by the wayside because of implicit bias.  All numbers from this report ,Screenwriting,dcb2zrh,22,t5_2qupf

Tries to escape the town but the road is caved in.

I am MORE than willing to get into Second Cityimprovsketchetc because thats such a great way to loosen up have fun and meet people with similar minds. If you reread my original OP youll see I only said I dont want to do stand upI stated that sketch and improv is crazy valuable. My general thoughts against PAassistant work is against the competition from film students interns and the like who dont have jobs. Im very stable and make good money so Im not destitute praying to break in. I write a lot and Id like to see if I can make itbut Im honestly not willing to beg on my knees to land a poorlypaid gig to fetch coffee for producers and maybe if Im lucky move up the ranks.So many starving writers apply for these assistant jobs. Im not all that desperate and Im not starving so I feel foolish trying to claw my way through one of the most competitive saturated avenues when my energy might be better spent elsewhere.Note that type of work is NOT beneath me. However I think just getting that job is crazy difficult let alone moving up from a PA to assistant to staff. Why not spend that time writing? I assume if I can write well enough an agentmanager might notice... fellowships blacklst etc. Yes its disgustingly competitive to get noticed via blacklst and I know that you have to be a crazy good writer. But that statement is also true for writers asst jobs too yes? My only point of this question was to ask if theres any way to meet the right people and prove my work ethic without being a poorlypaid lackey. Money isnt a concern for me and I will write either way. And if a writers assistant job landed on my lap I wouldnt turn it down.But assuming I dont want to chase those types of jobs isnt it just as plausible that I could keep writing and maybe connect with an agent who wants to rep me? It might not happen till my mid s or even early s but itd still be a way in... not saying its the best way. But considering how competitive writers asst positions are I cant say thats any more competitive than serendipitously becoming friends with an agents cousin or something like that.Sorry for the wall of text... just wanted to clarify my point since it seems you took my OP as if Im too lazy or unwilling to put in effort.,Screenwriting,dcmvmm3,1,t5_2qupf

It also tends to make sense to me to use it in these real life movies like Blow or Goodfellas.I have used it in one script and my goal was to have a reason for it so the story is narrated using voiceover telling the story of how a man won the lottery and ended up becoming addicted to heroin and losing it all. However at the end the voiceover is in my mind justified as it becomes evident that the voiceover is actually a memoir the main character wrote to explain what went wrong in his life to his sister who swore him off for good half way through. Basically we realize its voiceover as she sits reading the final page which explains that he needs to be alone once hes out of jail and he wont be returning to the city and he left her  million in a private account. Its the last of his money.I liked this use of voiceover because it had a purpose and a justification for its use that becomes clear in the final moments. ,Screenwriting,ddv4gtx,1,t5_2qupf

Try a whole conversation five times to get it right. But dont stop talking. Even if youre just thinking think aloud.Next transcribe it. The whole thing. Yes you have five versions of the same conversation write them all down. Every single thing you said.Then once its all complied into a single document start editing. Structure it properly add bits where needed change bits where appropriate. If something needs getting rid of move it into a separate scrap document which you can salvage from later. At this point it isnt a process of creation the raw materials are there its a process of refinement.Sometimes the best way to get out of your own head is to get your ideas out of it and make the page your workbench instead.,Screenwriting,de0z1nr,11,t5_2qupf

I really like the character Blue. I think his characters dialogue was great. I could see the themes and I think they were executed well enough especially for a short. You might want to work on showcasing his home life what makes him choose greed over hard work. You mentioned his dad went to jail but Id like a little bit more. As for the ending you are right it needs a little bit more work. but I personally think it needs to end with him running away from the house empty handed ties into the greed and hard work theme.

10954956,0,t1_de9olds,I do agree that if your goal is to bore the audience it is probably not a good thing. With that being said I believe that regardless of what Fords goal was this movie did an amazing job at being relatable. To me it is hardly a story about murder but more of an overall story about loss. The situation that is presented is terrifying and to me symbolic of something being tore away from a person without them having any capability to stopprevent it. Too many people can relate to this on many different levels. This was a beautiful story. In closing I originally believed the ending could have been a little better. However after thinking a little more about it I loved the end. I believe that this story was for Edward. It was his revenge plot played out in a nonviolent and fascinating way. He was able to snatch away any last thread of a relationship that Susan and Edward still had but in a way that made him feel good. Its extremely dark but a very common fantasy Id say after being hurt so badly by someone. One last thing in my opinion if Susans side of the story while reading the book was not told this entire story would lose its uniqueness and become just another movie about a tragic incident. The revenge driven underlying tone is what sets this story apart...to me and least. ,Screenwriting,de9xc6y,1,t5_2qupf

So I wont bother talking about your weird formatting since its not really hurting anyone.Only one big note I have  Craigs dialog is too much. Its good that youve got him in the straightman role but hes so straight it comes off as overthetop his dialog doesnt sound natural at all its like hes giving a series of minispeeches or hes in the shower imagining what hell say in some hypothetical situation.  Those scary high school students again? Who says that? She obviously knows who hes talking about so why say the whole thing? Wouldnt a real person call them those high schoolers or Those kids or most likely just they? Why would they even be scary to him? He sure doesnt seem scared. The fawning over her speech too I like the idea of it and you should definitely keep it in some form but its just too long and the specific words he chooses arent things people say unless theyre writing stories.Edit and at  isnt he older than the ones who add the word literally to sentences without a reason?On a more positive note I think the biggest reason that Craig stands out as unrealistic is because of how realistic the other characters are.

The werewolf killing your loved ones reveal isnt until the end of the second act so while I dont want to spoil it I think its required as a selling point.  So Ill try to figure that out.About the dream sequence  Damien waking up in a sweat and panting then rushing to call his dad doesnt make it clear that it was a dream?  I feel like that would definitely be the indicator if it were a film but if it isnt in the script then I can try to see what I can do with it to make it more clear.  Ill definitely introduce Alice as Alice Bailey and then drop off to her dialogue lines being headed by Alice.About the doctor keeping Damien I had it because Sanders needs to run into Damien right as hes feasting so he can continue his suspicions.I can cut that and probably just make it to where Sanders leaves the scene of the massacre right after Damien leaves the hospital.Also about Sanders getting Damiens address over the phone Ill add Sanders knowing the nurse or clerk and have him say Hey Its Sanders patch me through to Mr. Crowleys room or something and then when he knows about the release he says You got an address?.  Another note is that this is a small town really small town so I should probably put that in somewhere as well.If you do take another look at it Id appreciate it because Id love notes on the bigger parts of the story.Thanks for your time and thoughts either way!,Screenwriting,del819y,1,t5_2qupf

11448162,0,t1_dftdeuh,The example he gives in the podcast is a joke he wrote for The Office where Michael Scott is lost in the city doesnt have his phone and is trying to call work. He goes in a convenience store and asks to use the guys phone and then calls Work in that guys phone expecting to get Dunder Mifflin. Of course the convenience store phone rings.Steve Carrell wouldnt do the joke because he felt that Michael Scott wasnt actually that stupid. It would break the reality of the show.

11450263,0,t3_63g9j6,So is this part of something more you plan to write?Number one problem is there are no scenes. You start off at a doctors office then flow all the way into a kitchen with different set of characters. There were three locations Doctors office Car Carlys Kitchen.INT. DOCTORS OFFICE  DAYINT. CAR  DAYINT. CAR  DAYINT. CARLYS KITCHEN  DAYWithout breaking these up it is very confusing one where you are. You should take a look at the many posts about basic screenwriting structure and try to get it as close as you can.Another problem is there is no conflict. And if there is conflict it is incredibly minor you might be expanding on this so that could change but the only two pieces of conflict are Harvey not wanting to take the pill but he does without much convincing. Then Harvey wanting to go on an adventure and his girlfriend not wanting to.Thats not really anything major and doesnt make me care about the characters at all. Always try to make them relatable.,Screenwriting,dftvm9u,1,t5_2qupf

IMHO the best jokes come out of the way a character views the world plus their personality.  That may create conflict with other characters but its the view that makes it funny.  A good example is GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.  You have a team of characters each with a radically different view of the world and when they are all confronted with a situation they each see it differently.,Screenwriting,dfzgdqm,19,t5_2qupf

11573343,0,t1_dg7rrpx,gt The only part Id quibble with is one evaluation of commercial potential which seemed focused solely on theatrical distribution. I totally understand why an military action movie targeted at teenage girls would flop in theaters but I wrote it with niche markets like NetflixAmazon in mind.You have to think about cost vs expected revenue. I cant imagine that renting a submarine for a month and preparing it for a shoot would be cheap and given how little space there is it would still be a nightmare to shoot in. Its probably easier to construct your own subway set and film in that but that wont be cheap either. NetflixAmazon are going to be concerned with whether the number of people they expect to view the movie and whatever value they assign to an individual view exceeds the cost of producing it. Production isnt cheap and most of the movies NetflixAmazon have as exclusives are films they purchased distribution rights for at film festivals after someone else incurred the timeexpense of shooting it. For something theyre producing themselves theyd have to be able to make it on a very small budget andor have enough of a hook big movie star high concept multiquadrant appeal to justify spending extra. Handing Adam Sandler and his friends a camera and telling them to come back with four movies is cheaper than investing in a brand new property that will require an expensive shoot and only appeal to a small subset of their viewers.,Screenwriting,dg7uetv,5,t5_2qupf

I have a theory that a lot of the socalled rules of screenwriting came about from screenwriting teachers trying to break their students of bad habits. Its hard to get a student to understand the nuance of runs vs is running. By telling the student who writes. Ben is running down the street. His shoes are flapping against the pavement. His eyes are darting from side to side to not use ing verbs you improve his writing.

If the writer does not have a high quality script the information that this analysis supplies would be useless. As you have said the analysis makes no judgement on the quality of the script just the relation of its elements to other films. So prospective customers should really be informed of this and that they should not pay for this analysis unless their script has already been rated highly on the BL website. Otherwise they are paying for information that is useless to them as they dont have a script that could be sold regardless of what this analysis tells them.

I went had a look earlier because I was wondering the same thing myself  turns out theres relatively few of them probably a lot less in film than people think  Its still kind of popular in TV though  partially because as a lot of shows require a precredits teaser sometimes its just easier to stick in some action from later and then reveal how theyve ended up there. I still like it as a device when it works its pretty cool Breaking Bad is a great example of it done well  its probably overused but I read a script from a writer the other day which started with the main character at their lowest ebb business ruined phones ringing refusing to answer them locked in his office... and then it went back to the start and Ive got to admit..

11713259,0,t1_dgnbdx2,This is an entirely valid reaction. uTimeTraveler is also right  memory alteration is nothing new to scifi  but Im definitely writing in the wake of Inception and that does colour the screenplay.However Inceptions mechanism revolves around spectacle. Multiple people can enter the dream. The subconscious resists. The dreams can be layered with time distortion occurring between them all the while the protagonists are stalked by a manifestation of Cobbs wife. Really cool shit fun viewing. I have none of that.All I take is the simple fact that lucid dreaming is our strongest natural means of creating something similar to a memory. After throwing in a means to record and transfer it were done. This means several things No shared dreams. The protagonist is alone. The dreamer has to draw on their own experiences actively which can be an issue if those experiences are traumatic.I wasnt interested in the spectacle element as much  why compete with Nolan for that? Ultimately only a small proportion of my script is spent dreaming. The rest of it follows a wellintentioned but ultimately broken protagonist who is unambiguously on the wrong side of the law. What happens when you take a mentally ill highly resourceful criminal and throw in a dead body?  What happens when he becomes trapped between protecting his friends protecting the integrity of the technology and protecting himself?Thats Dreamer.As for the logline I just really suck with loglines.

11717183,0,t3_6766g2,Im about to teach you the  most valuable words in screenwriting Inspired by actual events. Fundamentally what this means is you owe your idea for the film to something that took place in reality but youre not claiming to represent anything that may have actually happened. So you get some latitude.Examples of this mainly exist within the horrorthriller genre are and some of the better known films include The Exorcist which was made into a film  years after the actual exorcism of Roland DoeRobbie MannheimPsycho Silence of the Lambs and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre all of which include elements of the life of Ed Gein.Hope it helps,Screenwriting,dgo674y,3,t5_2qupf

Nudity used correctly can be a valuable motif. In the source material people stripped down to their underwear however I didnt think that that was enough. Nudity has inherent ties to the primal side of humans. Stripping indicates people giving in to the primal desires driving them to the mountain and in some cases into the holes. By making themselves fully nude they are fully giving into the mountain. It also gives them a layer of vulnerability and makes the audience a little bit more uneasy.That being said Ill take you opinion to heart during my next edit.
