255589,0,t1_cf78rbx,Do you mean in terms of concentration or real life commitments?If concentration then Im curious do you prefer modellingtexturing or programming?Thanks for your efforts on this game! Its incredible as it is especially for an indie game.,Rodina,cf78wqj,3,t5_2ts6g
346083,0,t1_cfgc8yn,By the way are the scanners still a work in progress OFCOURSE they are whole thing is a work in progress P because I got a popup Your scanners picked up a new signal... and nothing has changed when I go check the scanners.Edit Also after this message I have been unable to clear all of the POInodessings even though I take every datastick and emptycrate and ammocratebarrel. I havent gotten any new encryption keys after that too.Also The ship is in space! doesnt apply on the surface of the planet after landing.,Rodina,cfgn28y,2,t5_2ts6g
557306,0,t1_cg1mnum,gt I think I read earlier that you also intended to make the FTL travel mouse control easier?Ive already done that actually no new plans to make that easier.gt Will there be some kind of hardcoreness slider somewhere in the game settings to control all these things at once?Hm its all kinda hacked together I know. Im not sure how best to combine them all. Right now theres a movement difficulty slider.... but Im not sure if I want that to govern what Im talking about here even though it totally falls under the category of movement difficulty. Will have to think about this.All the options will be in the same place anyway.,Rodina,cg3mer2,1,t5_2ts6g

1178699,0,t3_1wummg,i agree a cockpit view makes you feel like you are the pilot of a ship where as a rd person view make you feel like you are the ship which is kind of immersion breaking imho,Rodina,ci2823x,1,t5_2ts6g

1960574,0,t1_ckpdeuh,Great point. There are a few reasons. First blowing the airlock wont work if theres not a vacuum outside your ship so it wont ever work on a planet surface. Second you can definitely game the decompression probably too much! but Ive also found that sometimes I think Im going to be fine but then make a wrong move and end up blown out anyway. And depending on the orientation of your ship its possible to not make it back in. Mistakes do happen But I really agree with you. It definitely deflates the tension. This is something I havent really spent much time thinking about to be honest. My thinking is that I can always balance things differently over time. I can make decompression more dangerous. I can give your jetpack less fuel and make it harder to get back into your ship. Theres lot of options.But on a different more meta level Im not afraid of the game changing over time. Maybe fires were REALLY dangerous and hard for one update but the era of the reign of terror is over. Maybe a new feature will make them harder in the future. Maybe a future feature will mean that you really really dont want to blow the airlock because something valuable might be blown out as well dun dun dun So yeah I agree with you and I dont think its optimal right now but I also like to think of the game as a kind of dynamic art piece where its focus and character will change over time. If people want the full experience they should try the game now rather than waiting for it to be done  If you know what I mean.,Rodina,ckpg90e,3,t5_2ts6g

2023088,0,t1_ckugx8p,Turns out there were some I guess unrelated? underlying issues. Let a couple pending updates run to make sure they werent the problem and now its fubard with bluescreen on boot and stuck in an infinite attempting repairs loop.Looks like Im back to lurking until ifwhen the linux port happens in any case P,Rodina,ckwz8ty,1,t5_2ts6g

3914552,0,t3_35adnu,for anyone curious the glass walls will be seperate objects as will the pillars.EDIT also wanted to point out that anyone who REALLY wants to use one of my mods before its updated just add this line to the GameplayLoadScripts file in scripts folder at the end      EGCompileFile true ScriptsGameplayEGMenuPilot.lua that should fix the issue of not being able to get st person pilot mode,Rodina,cr2hsu8,1,t5_2ts6g
4176185,0,t3_38m9u1,Im definitely going to say that robot babies should be the next step as the game feels... empty as it is. Its hard to convince my friends that Rodina is worth following when such a basic feature is completely missing.  As an aside I really do need to buy into Rodina. I just need to get a computer that can run it first. ,Rodina,crwahc9,1,t5_2ts6g
5119205,0,t3_3l434a,Sounds like a problem with either your sound card of your headphones. Try again with some other headphones. If that fixes the issue then your headphones are busted ,Rodina,cv3214e,2,t5_2ts6g

6558484,0,t3_459phe,Oh man! You got hit by this bug introduced in the last update that I have yet to reproduce or figure out. So sorry!Your post gave me some new good info that I will use to try and fix it though. Im gonna try just letting the ship drift near  fall into the sun while out of pilot mode and see if that does it.If you cant end up finding an autosave that is right please send me your broken savegame and I will fix it and send it back to you! brendanellipticgames.com,Rodina,czxp9hj,1,t5_2ts6g
6562039,0,t1_czxp9hj,thanks for the feedback! its always cool when devs are interactive with the community and Im glad i could provide some info for you. And to send you my game do i just compress the folder from my steamapps and email it? thank you for fixing me lol I didnt want to have to start over,Rodina,czy2idr,1,t5_2ts6g
7828584,0,t1_d3vz09q,gt completely remove the ability to explore deep canyonsNot every planet should recieve thisgt I guess if you assume the player can also operate underwaterAt first no  no operation underwater just damage if you hit water so you have to elave it.gt look bland would it?If you add an animated surface texture it wouldnt anymore.,Rodina,d3vzzxq,4,t5_2ts6g

8579572,0,t1_d6dveug,It just has a amazing feel to it right? Or am I crazy...,Rodina,d6e14v7,3,t5_2ts6g
8593530,0,t1_d6eobnm,Its fun to note that they begin very similarly. Waking up with no memory and a damaged ship. They also have similar arcs at first it seems repairing your ship to enable you to travel progressively farther. But Rodina begins on an asteroid that feels very different to the planets due to size gravity and no atmosphere which I really like. In Rodina you progress quicker of course but the whole game is short at the moment especially when youve played through it once.But the main difference that makes all the difference to me is that Rodina starts with story and builds the world after. For now we fill in the blanks in our heads as we always do when enjoying a story in any medium. We know that a game can get by with a story onlyIm old enough to have enjoyed text adventures and not as a curiosity. But a game cant get by with a graphical world only and especially not an autogenerated world where nothing has any real meaning.Or if theres only  the world you better be able to at least make some sort of impact on it. In Minecraft you can change the whole landscape. NMS seems to be designed fundamentally so that the player cant leave any sort of persistent trace of their existence. I think thats a big mistake. That said Im not dismissing NMS. I might end up loving it for all I know. Im currently waiting for some PC patches before buying.And just to be clear I agree that Rodina regularly looks amazing. There isnt a planet that doesnt have an awesome sunrise. Together with the music that goes a long way to keep me entertained.,Rodina,d6fs5r9,1,t5_2ts6g
