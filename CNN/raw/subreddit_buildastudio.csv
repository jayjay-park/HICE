4416355,0,t3_3bm3gr,The amount of cores does not equate to raw computation power. Even in computing there can be quality over quantity. Its actually not that common for audio applications to take advantage of all of them either unfortunately.The FX actually loses to just the i in benchmarks. The added punch of the i comes in at a higher price point but that is to be expected. Intels hyperthreading in their i line can take advantage of those few applications that allow you to use  cores too. This is particularly useful in video production but is not necessary for audio production by any means.The i is a worthy investment but you can even knock it down to an i and youd be set for at least three or four years before you start to notice probably. Im kind of biased though since I am still rocking a Sandy Bridge i from like .Also just to note Id stay away from the Saffire range since Firewire is dying at a really fast pace. I have the Pro and kind of regret getting it since its nearly impossible to sell. I also had to buy an aftermarket firewire PCIe card since the firewire controllers on my motherboard were not supported. I also used an ASRock for what its worth.,buildastudio,csnghb4,6,t5_2zasd

6827695,0,t1_d0q5olj,Maybe I got ahead of myself and didnt specify what I need. This studio will be in the basement of a future live work me and my wife are building in a very expensive neighborhood that has a small town feel to it.  The neighborhood has  schools a gym  salons and just numerous other businesses all in the middle and houses around them.  We have a lot picked out and are going to start a music studio running at home lessons where our teachers will drive to clients and teach piano voice guitar. We will be scheduling events as far as weddings and partys for our talent to go play at. We have several teachers that have college degrees to teach various instruments. This will be our main focus. I wanted to have a recording studio in the basement for dad bands and maybe students to come and record a song. I want this to be nice modern studio but yes your right those consoles are super expensive and would take up most my budget. I would like to be able to hold recitals in the live space and even have it as a room ppl can rent and play with the band there. I am guessing I can run this off a small digital studio instead of going analog but honestly I dont know where to start. ,buildastudio,d0q7wb4,2,t5_2zasd

8651275,0,t1_d6mp17x,Ill let you k ow so far only the studio stud work is done. Using a box that has a sort of zig zag airflow lined with acoustic fibreglass seems to be the best bet. Im trying to find a fan to run in it as well. Seems to be that negative pressure is desired to encourage airflow into the room and remove foul air from the top.  ,buildastudio,d6n0tpg,1,t5_2zasd

9584057,0,t3_5c2vx9,I had no idea Audio Technica made headsets!   Looking at it on Amazon it appears to come with this cable I dont understand that since both of those plugs are pole. The pink one is supposed to be pole but the black one should be pole for stereo audio...      Then looking at a review of it Im more confused because it shows a photo of them and here they are both pole But the mic isnt stereo! Maybe its a balanced signal. But then on that SAME review theres a photo of the box with the pair of pole plugs.         Can you post a photo of exactly what cables you have for it?    Fact is most studio gear is aimed towards recording duh so a headset that has some shitty .mm microphone cable isnt really of interest. Audiophile gear on the other hand is geared towards playback.    Why are you wanting to upgrade? Does the mic sound bad? Headphones have white noise or hissing? Headphones dont get loud enough?   Motherboard audio broken? Case audio broken  noisy?   Do you like the sound of the headphones?   Elaborate why you want to upgrade. If you want better sound quality for music Id recommend selling them and getting proper headphones  a DACamp with a modmic. Those are  on Amazon so if you could sell them for anywhere near a third of that  your  budget youd have loads of options    If you like the sound quality but want them louder you just need a headphone amp.   If you like the mic and feel of the headset but your motherboard has bad sound you could get a DACamp.    If you like the sound quality but the mic sounds bad just get a modmic type thing.  So elaborate more if you want actual help.   ,buildastudio,d9ufibj,1,t5_2zasd
