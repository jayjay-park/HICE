452845,0,t3_1z6ue1,As a recent transplant to the area can someone correct me if Im wrong is there no mixeduse spaces in downtown Fresno? You know business downstairs and housing upstairs? I was just looking at Craigslist and all I see are houses but no apartments. What was the point of having the mall closed if its sole purpose was to have people drive there just to walk? Most places that are centered around the car for transportation are filled with people who want to park as close to the door of where they are about to shop as possible.From what I know of it the real failure was thinking that simply by closing off the mall and attempting to bring in new businesses was a going to solve all the issues. To have a Walkcentric system you have to build other things that support it. Mixed use housing markets to support it and infrastructure that allows people to not have to actually get in a car to achieve all their needs. The corporate businesses downtown which Im sure there must be some would have people who wouldnt mind being able to walk to work to shop to dinner etc. But that requires a holistic view that from what it sounds like was not taken when they decided to close it down. Sacramento has the same problem and has decided to open up the K street mall. I dont have great hopes that that will solve their issue either.,fresno,cfrqk0n,2,t5_2r5of

There is a lot of great information on those pages and its actually updated at least yearly. Some of it is pretty dry legalese for reporting to other agencies but look around a bit and you can usually find what you need. I got a hair up my ass a while back to see how much was actually going into the program and how much we got out of it. Turns out its a really sad state of affairs and we pay a shit ton of money to recycle products. It was supposed to be a netzero proposition originally with CRV covering the cost but it has inflated massively over the years as every contractor and their mom gets a piece of the pie. Now its just out of control.Anyhow you can get your . a can back though. Its just a pain to do it.,fresno,cicw3tg,2,t5_2r5of

It was not the Gizzlies who sought to sever their ties but the Sacramento River Cats had wanted to dump the As and actively pursued the Giants affiliation.The loss of the SF affiliation was really due to the Grizzlies ownership and the lack of faith the Giants had in them.

Firstly they seem to have been very upfront with the situation including that he turned out not to be armed.

11049800,0,t1_dekgaty,What credential are you going for?Its really going to come down to how much effort you put into your program and how comfortable your master teacher is with letting you take control of the class.

Paid for college myself but didnt get Cal or Pell because my parents made too much?I was offered plenty in the way of federal loans to cover the costs of the program. But if costs are an issue FSU is just fine or heck even National if youre worried about costs. Just like if you go to an Ivy League school youre mainly buying name recognition alongside the rigor of the program. I liked FPU because they are small and personable.
