If she were to take this to a cabinet shop to do it for real scrape down finish fill sand and colour match and clear coat match. You would have to do the whole top it would cost more than that. It would most likely end up looking about the same as the pastel trick. ,furniturerestoration,cqsku3w,1,t5_37hsx

8764708,0,t3_505di7,Bought a nest of tables from a charity shop but they spots of wear like in the picture on all three of the tables. How would I go about restoring these. Im guessing varnish stripper sanding staining dunno what with and coating with some finish. Would anyone be nice enough to give me some more detailed instructions on how to go about this. ,furniturerestoration,d7190z2,1,t5_37hsx
9452708,0,t1_d9e5myb,Thanks for the info if I cant find someone to refurbish them for me I will give some of it a try. I figured it was going to be a giant PITA to try it myself but I thought I would give it a go if someone could tell me a tried and true way wishful thinking. Somewhere I have the name of a guy who restored the backing on one of the rockers for my grandmother a few years ago but I would have to dig that info out of old paperwork in her house. If possible I would probably find a professional do fix them up because Im so afraid of hurting them!,furniturerestoration,d9e74k0,1,t5_37hsx
