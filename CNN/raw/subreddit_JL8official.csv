1686695,0,t1_cjk82cr,Yeah I actually thought he was going to use Hals words against him to demonstrate that by Hals definition Sinestro himself is cool. That would have gotten a great response from Hal. ,JL8official,cjrrt8b,1,t5_3182h
1716560,0,t1_cjv9gh1,Honestly I think Yale needs to lawyer up. Farinas has been throwing a lot of unsubstantiated accusations at him. Everything from pocketing donation money to being a pervert. Im not the kind of person that would defend Yale because I like his comic. Farinas whole rant against Yale came off as manipulative and salty. The dude has commissioned work posted on his website of characters he doesnt own and it just so happens that he got in merchstickers in the last  hours according to his Facebook page. Yale hasnt helped himself but Farinas seems like a total scumbag to me at this point.,JL8official,cjvj9my,3,t5_3182h
