4286943,0,t3_3a1968,An interesting one and one that is nearly impossible to search for considering theres another shanty called Haul on the Bowline which has even been recorded before as Haul away the Bowline as a matter of fact by the Exmouth Shanty Men. This song however is an original song Haul Away the Bowline Boys by the Exmouth Shanty Men and as such probably wont be found much elsewhere than their website. ,seashanties,cs8uyaj,1,t5_2sjg8

5757435,0,t3_3tz3vz,This does not belong here...not even a little. I barely agreed with that one rock punk shantie that was popular a while ago. This is just a techno song with barely any lyrics.,seashanties,cxarjbk,1,t5_2sjg8

8861912,0,t1_d7d0lcv,Me too! I waited for at least  hours probably closer to  to tour El Galen and was very happy with that decision. Draken Harald Hrfagre was only about an hour wait but it is also an incredible ship. I have some pictures of both but the phone that they were on had an accident. Im waiting on a dongle to see if I can replace them.,seashanties,d7d2sb2,1,t5_2sjg8
