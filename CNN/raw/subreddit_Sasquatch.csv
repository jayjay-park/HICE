280563,0,t3_1xakka,I would go  ATLiens   IMO all time classic album and has more polish than their  album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik  Aquemini   An all time great Rap album  Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik   Now that youve heard some of their groovy shit you might dig their first outing.  Stankonia   Getting a little more poppy to make that money but still great tracks on here.  SpeakerboxxxThe Love Below   More of a split album between Big Boi and Andre really but still good with some memorable tracks.  Idlewild   I kept one song off of this album for my collection lol just not a fan of this record.If you dig that check out Big Bois solo albums too. His first one Sir Lucious Left Foot The Son of Chico Dusty very lyrical with more of an old school boombop rap vibe was good but not my favourite other people love it though. I really liked his last album though Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors loved the production and the fusion of more electronic beats into it.ATliens and Aquemini are definitely two of my favourite hip hop albums of all time though check em. And get ready to groove to this at the gorge. ,Sasquatch,cf9ud4x,5,t5_2saia
