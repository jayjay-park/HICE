In the second phase stand on the far left platform to avoid his bombs and take your time with the timed bomb.

6184054,0,t1_cylje0c,The thing is the game knows youve collected the content because it shows it right there in your Poppit after you import your LBP  content. I dont think those items would even show up if you hadnt already legitimately collected them. It just gives you a decline message when you actually try to select them for use.

6417686,0,t3_433m02,I think if a fourth was made it should be done by Sumo. Reason why is theyve learned from their mistakes.

6652349,0,t1_d079uc9,gt Sumo found a way to make a huge improvement from  to  but they were absolutely terrible at getting these improvements noticed because they focused too much on teh new characters looool.Im actually pleased with how little emphasis was placed on the new characters.  When the trailers were showing I was afraid that they would make them primary stars of the show like Sackboy but was pleasantly surprised to see that the focus was still on Sackboy himself with the others as occasional side characters.gt Im talking a blank slate. LBP with a proper marketing campaign and launch with no bugs. Even if the game is drastically similar to LBP it doesnt matter what matters is the perception from the community.Its really unrealistic for a sequel to be so similar to its previous installment.  Spending years developing a seminew game wont change anything.  Its wiser to continue improving LBP.  As I said the game has gotten much better treatment since its rocky release and its a really good game now.gt At this point LBP just seems like a lost cause. Theres no use trying to fix it because its player base is all but dead.A lot of people say this but in my experience its not very true.  There is still a thriving playerbase of creators and players and a lot of new and underrated creators are finally getting recognition.  Any fanbase is bound to move on at some point so the LBP series simply has more variety now not necessarily less people.  If you look at the final months of LBP before  came out it was very visibly dying.  It may have been initially controversial but the release of LBP practically saved the series.gt Bring a fresh new title on just the PS so the player base wont be devided market it properly get back the old players and new ones and make LBPs populace and potential bigger than it ever was.Believe me I would love a new installment in my alltime favorite video game series but this just isnt the way to do it.  A sequel needs to be breaking new grounds and as of now its not financially or communally wise.  Maybe in a few years when hardware has gotten even better and there are enough new fresh ideas to justify a sequel. ,littlebigplanet,d07esbs,1,t5_2rqr8

Then in the level have barriersobstacles and such that you can hide behind. Peak around the corner to get a few shots then go back. health would regen slowly over time Would require some strategy and be faster paced than the current stand around for mins and shoot bullets in eachothers faces at point blank. ,littlebigplanet,ddg9fut,1,t5_2rqr8
