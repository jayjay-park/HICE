4359593,0,t3_3aw2xd,from what I know you cant really do anything. hes sent you the product even if it is a bit shit along with a couple freebies and youve sent him the money. the money will stay in escrow and go to the vendor  eventually. there is no way you can get the money back from escrow unless it was a scam which you would then message the mods for help.,NucleusMarket,csh25iu,1,t5_35req

6516072,0,t1_czqyh2r,I dont necessarily think hes a child while he could be I sure hope he isnt as youre right children shouldnt be anywhere near drugs like this.  I think hes probably young and grew up using cell phones with little real education.  Thats most likely why his grammar is so awful and that he has no idea who to really use the English language.Either way a complete moron who should be avoided.  Support suspended his account again after my reporting his messages.  I suppose Im happy they did that but was hoping theyd be a bit more aggressive and just ban him.,NucleusMarket,cztb9ip,1,t5_35req

7537778,0,t3_4il65i,basically the money you paid for the order is likely gone  if you havent got it by now it wont be coming and there isnt a great deal you can do about it to be perfectly honest.many honest vendors honoured all orders that had been accepted when the market went down  others did not. if you havent received your package it would seem your vendor falls into the latter category and with the market still down and looking unlikely to return you cant raise a dispute with support obviouslyyour only chance is if you find the vendor on another market and message them they may honour your order  they may not it depends on who it is. or the ever remote looking possibility that if nucleus returns you can contact supportmost nucleus vendors are on alpha bay and dream market. hope this helps  if you post the vendors username i or someone else may be able to advise further,NucleusMarket,d2z0bmj,1,t5_35req
