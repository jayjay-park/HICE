3323510,0,t3_2w4859,One of Irvings bits of advice that Ive really come to appreciate was along these lines. He said once he had the final line he was ready to start the book and I think thats true for me too. I have a much better idea of what Im doing when I see how it all will close. Ive had the final line for my current novel draft finished  pages closely editedrewritten since October and a few months ago I had the first decent idea for a final line in my next novel which was really a motivating shot of energy. I see the whole thing better the structures begun emerging more clearly themes motifs all of it.,literarywriters,cp73wii,2,t5_36t6x
