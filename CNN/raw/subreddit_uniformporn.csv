1362204,0,t1_cimttm6,Its not the opposite because thats also true here at least partly. If youre separated from the service youre not entitled to wear the uniform. If youre actually retired you wear the uniform on official occasions.My grandfather and father were both career officers and both of them used to get annoyed when there was some special event that required them to dress up. My father especially if it meant dress blues. He always said he felt like a band leader.He taught high school for a number of years after retiring and allowed his hair to grow a little long and when he got invited to some public military event that he felt he couldnt evade he would have to go and get a haircut. Colonels cant wear long hair. People would talk. Unquote.,uniformporn,cin1ilh,1,t5_2wel6

Looks silly in my opinion but its official.And that hat really doesnt go with the coat.,uniformporn,d9cohe9,1,t5_2wel6

11541833,0,t1_dg49lek,First two on the left. The new ones are the ones with the diagonal stripes. IMO the blue is a bit to technicolor for me a darker shade like the USMC dress blues would work better here. ,uniformporn,dg49obp,6,t5_2wel6

The first constitution the Albertine Statute the Parliament first Italian legislature is numbered VII due to this and the Government were established in  and continued the path. It is always worth to mention in fact that in  almost every region of Italy excluding Latium Veneto Friuli and Trentino hold a referendum to be included in the Kingdom of Sardinia and after the annexation on March th  the Parliament proclaimed the Kingdom of Italy. There are also institutions which predates the Kingdom of Sardinia for example the Military Academy of Modena was established in Turin on January st  Kingdom of Sardinia was proclaimed in .,uniformporn,dgdsy9l,10,t5_2wel6
