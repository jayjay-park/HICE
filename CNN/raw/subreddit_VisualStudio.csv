4331165,0,t3_3aly6s,I would either have one sub that goes through each box and adds up the total or have code in each check box the increments and decrement the total for the individual box. Basically dont try to worry about combinations look at each element separately. ,VisualStudio,csduo3v,2,t5_2t23h

5859599,0,t3_3vhijx,gtEven if I have the Create directory for solution unchecked Visual Studio still creates a whole folder for the project. You basically answered your own question. Solutions and projects are two different things. Projects always get their own folders because two projects cant exist in one folder due to potentially overlapping file and directory names.,VisualStudio,cxnq0wj,4,t5_2t23h
6644502,0,t1_d06l4r5,I checked that.  I looked at the modules when it was running and basically all of them cant find the PDB file.  I tried to right click and load them but I have no idea where they reside.  Searching on google tells me to rebuild but I dont have any build options that I can see when Im working with python.,VisualStudio,d06lkub,1,t5_2t23h

9184550,0,t1_d8cx0sq,I think I had the same problem as you. I updated PTVS and then opened a c project that i wasnt able to run. I decided to repair VS from Programs and Features but the problem was still there.Then i tried to open project in VS and in solution explorer it said the solution was unavailable. I right clicked on project I think which gave me an option to install missing components. I installed them and now everything works.I hope this helps. I only program for fun so please excuse my simplified explanation. ,VisualStudio,d8g7jak,1,t5_2t23h
9757686,0,t1_dafunf8,gt Just keep in mind that the licenses you get for software and OS are for development and testing purposes only. So you cant spin up a machine with a Msdn win  and use it for your home pc to play games or pay your bills.Ah that feels very important. Thanks for the headsup. As for the rest I dont think my company uses them but Ill definitely do research on it when Im out of the evaluation months.,VisualStudio,dafuq2w,1,t5_2t23h
9838119,0,t1_dapwkcx,VS can load most VS projects which remaining backwards compatible.  I say most because I have one project that uses an external VS extension installed for DevExtreme projects which I cant upgrade to VS without a big rewrite of the hacked javascript.What is stopping you specifically?,VisualStudio,dapxh9j,2,t5_2t23h

11538202,0,t3_64je7a,Theoritically both can be an IDE with all the features you want since VS code can and most likely already is also utilize native processes to act as services just like VS does today for some of its services. At that point your UI language doesnt matter much.Practically my guess is that hosting designers in VS code would be more difficult then in a native app like VS. But on the other hand you can port vs code easier to other platforms due to its UI design although the ease of portability comes at a performance hit for some cases.,VisualStudio,dg3uvoe,2,t5_2t23h
