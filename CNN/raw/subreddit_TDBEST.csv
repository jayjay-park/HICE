AVG    S Frostbite NA  S Masquerade st Owen  S Fantasy th Owen Merge  S Reflection th Owen Quit    One of the more experienced players of the game  was just a normal year for this vet. Making it to merge in th place was a nice touch and while he may not have made it as deep in Masquerade or Reflection he did well in the game for his time there. Whether or not he chooses to be back in  is unclear but this longtime player of the game should be proud for making it all the way to rd place on the rankings.,TDBEST,dc9g6r9,1,t5_3iag8

AVG    S Frostbite Gwen th Merge    S Masquerade Crimson nd  S Fantasy Ella th  S Reflection Amy th Merge    When you look for most improved players of  Absol should be at the top of everyones list. While she may have had some consistency troubles as seen by getting taken out mid premerge twice she also made it into the top  twice. Its been a much different Absol as  goes on and while she may not have won in the eyes of the jury in Reflection she has made some major changes as she looks to become one of the games bigger players. Can she add to her trophy count during ? Time will tell. ,TDBEST,dd7wnie,1,t5_3iag8
