4073718,0,t3_373gkv,This post reminded me of a website that I havent heard from for some time. Finally it clicked in memory. Its called Forgotten Anarchism It a regular collection project that posts translations by anarchist women writers of the past and its quite interesting. The originals are so far in French Spanish and Portuguese. ,worldanarchism,crkmpha,2,t5_37l2r

6104672,0,t1_cyjiko0,Masses is an old commie term that the Maoists took up in the s and proceeded to massively overuse and misuse. Historically it was an alternative to proletariat or working class that was originally used in Comintern propaganda directed at countries where the actual working class were a small minority China Vietnam etc . and where the peasantry were the majority. When the Maoists began using it it rapidly became meaningless being as the Maoists self appointed themselves as the crowned representatives of some vague broad masses usually somewhere else in the world rather than their own countries. A better term would have been laboring classes. Note the plural. The word masses carries with it a connotation of the vanguardist groups where it originated.In the past some anarchists actually used the term and even today it is used by Bulgarian anarchists. They can be forgiven. It is also still used by all sorts of people in India which can also be forgiven. Amongst national lefts who have survived the Maoist encephalopathy its use is a tipoff to conspiratorial programs of seizing power in the name of the real people who make up the patronizing term.Purge ? Yeah. I sometime slip back into lefty talk despite my best intentions. The FBI once wrote a manual on how to spot commies by the use of certain words in their vocabulary even when they are talking about nonpolitical matters.  Its however an accurate descriptive term for a pretty well universal action carried out by Leninist sects and many other political parties as well. Outside of politics it usually means the use of either emetics laxatives or both at once. These drugs are called purgatives. Its a common word in quack medicine circles.,worldanarchism,cyjjert,1,t5_37l2r
