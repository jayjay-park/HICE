938024,0,t1_ch67w7a,Nah Aomine seems worried imo because he knows Akashi was doing almost nothing the whole game. I personally am just waiting or Akashi to do something just INCREDIBLE. I cant even imagine some ability that would be on the level or beyond that of Emperors Eye. ,KurokosBasketball,chawq1z,1,t5_2vpkq

3126162,0,t1_colyky6,Midorima is nothing but a jump shooter so its easy to predict his movements. He wouldnt be able to defend Aomine off the dribble.,KurokosBasketball,com0x1y,1,t5_2vpkq
3453224,0,t3_2zrqfv,Im actually gonna go with Murasakibara. Overall Kagami is stronger at that point but I dont think the Zone  grants too much utility to defense. The main thing it grants is flawless coordination with teammates which is primarily used for offense. Then when you look at the defense of the two they have the same range at that point but now the main differences are height and reaction time. They already said Murasakibara is just built for basketball and his reactions are almost flawless so at the least I dont think Kagami has him beat here he doesnt necessarily win either. Then theres height and this is where Murasakibara wins out. Reachwise Murasakibara has a massive wingspan and can reach really far. His long limbs also make him very mobile. You could argue Kagami makes up for this with his jumping power but theres a gaping weakness there. The way they beat Murasakibaras defense in the game vs Yosen was by forcing him to jump and taking advantage of that airtime to run successive attacks. Well if thats the case Kagamis massively higher jumps mean a WHOLE LOT more airtime so it would be way easier to coordinate those attacks against him. Murasakibara in a lot of cases avoids that weakness by not jumping and additionally has a much shorter airtime than Kagami if he DOES jump so he get get back and stop a successive attack much more quickly.,KurokosBasketball,cplw756,2,t5_2vpkq
4362779,0,t1_cshelqy,He really only seems abusive towards Kise which is probably because he knows that if he doesnt keep giving Kise much needed reality checks his ego as a great basketball player and a teen model would make him absolutely insufferable.,KurokosBasketball,cshf41z,1,t5_2vpkq

7908485,0,t1_d42v906,Russel Westbrook is barely  though. Akashi had no trouble stealing from Midorima who was about  inches taller than himself. I agree with the rest though. I think the only people who could possibly get past him are centers honestly.,KurokosBasketball,d44zlqe,2,t5_2vpkq
8215095,0,t1_d54fbe2,chill man its just fictional charactersyou out there lookin like you know him personallyand i doubt hed average especially the  PPG.Alsothe league was way tougher back then than now so the GoM or any player really would be less good back the days im talking MJrodmanshaq etc... days.And i was talking DI NCAA .alsorondo had a good career but im sorry to say that he aint a top player man hes killing it for assists though but hes nowhere near currywestbrookdurantLBJ etc...,KurokosBasketball,d54fwqc,0,t5_2vpkq

11272981,0,t1_df9rfo3,Aomine was skipping practice the whole last year and you tell me that he remained the Ace because everyone else wasnt trying to be Ace? Nah man. He stayed the Ace even when he wasnt coming to practice with everyone having their skills developed. On Extra Game Aomine and Kagami are the double ace. So what then?You can make all the excuses you want Aomine and Kagami are stated as best players on Vorpal Swords by being called the Double Ace.The reason Akashi isnt an ace on a GoM team is because he is  and not a  scoring option on a GoM team.The point of the game is to score the basketball and scorers will always have the most difficult job. Assists are exactly what they are assists. The person who has to finish the job is the scorer.You can be a PG and be a best player on the team. Ask Westbrook. Ask Harden. Ask Curry sometimes. Ask Isiah Thomas. I can go on.,KurokosBasketball,df9ry06,1,t5_2vpkq

11390675,0,t1_dfn3qrl,Also here are some feats for you just so you know what he is capable of I think he shot plenty here and before you say Extra game remember different opponent different play style and more reliable teammates mean you can afford to pass more so yeah Akashi gt kagami as for aomine I dont know it would be close and could go either way. I literally dont understand why you are hung up on the word ace lol. That shit lost its meaning after all the GoM were averaging over  points when they were in teiko lol wtf they were all super scorers kagami himself said aomine is better than him. When they beat touu academy he said aomine won but Ill win next time in the interview and frankly basing what they can do only from extra game is stupid it was be the most recent however that means nothing because when comparing people especially in anime and show you compare their feats what they HAVE DOWN in the whole show now the latest episode. Show it is the latest showing of their skill but it ISNT THE ONLY showing of skill remember that ,KurokosBasketball,dfn458s,1,t5_2vpkq

You cant quantify that lol.Its all opinion.But most will agree literally breaking a guys shoulder with a simple block is more impressive because it has never been done since then.
