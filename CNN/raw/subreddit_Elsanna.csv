2993258,0,t1_co85un9,Im just a lurker here but thats exactly how A archiveofourown.org came to be a few years back after a few too many rounds of deletions from ff.net.  Like ff.net its multifandom but its also fanrun and allows explicit content so everyones fics should be safe there. The only real downside is that theyre just not really the goto place in the Frozen fandom and the interface seems to discourage people from actually commenting so fics tend to get a lot less feedback than on ff.net which Im sure gets discouraging for the authors.,Elsanna,co88zdy,5,t5_2zwxc
3029091,0,t1_cobtkrx,Eh its all relative. I think one shouldnt use Belle or any character merely as a stepping point for a different romance or plot point. I mean in my Elsanna I used Belle because I needed Elsa to have a romance before Anna. Theres no angst in the Belsa aside from what Elsas inner demons create and the whole relationship is resolved rather nicely or will be when I get to writing it.The point is Belle is fine imo. Belsa is fine. Just dont use characters to further the plot or to push Anna and Elsa together. Instead use them to develop the other characters. Theyre people to and need to act like itnot just some plot device.,Elsanna,cobyo9m,2,t5_2zwxc

If someone would point out the same things that I just did to the executives they might accept it if it just doesnt come up then they will go along the path of least resistence but that will all mostly depend on random personal choices that we cant really predict.

I think the most disney will do with Kristanna is say that they are supposedly love interests and leave it at that unless they want to a repeat of OUAT. That being said Anna has only said I love you to one person this entire time and that was Elsa and vise verso where Elsa said that she loved Anna in Frozen Fever.  As for your comment about Kristoff following Elsas lead I agree with you all the way.Also for Disneys happy ending there was one where there was no love interest because this princess literally kicked every ones ass and that my friend was Merida. ,Elsanna,cqlnfyf,1,t5_2zwxc

3793534,0,t1_cqomvi4,Geez louise I have said multiple times that Im not stopping people from writing what they want. Please read the title of this post again.Raping someone is not romantic. Sexually assaulting them is not romantic. That content may trigger someone else. So the simple thing to do is just say may contain triggering scenes. Something that general will not trigger someone not will it spoil any part of the story. The better imo solution is simply not to make rape romantic in the first place. People are allowed to write what they want. They can make one character rape another if they want. However making a victim fall in love with their rapist is wrong on so many levels. It perpetuates rape culture shows to impressionable minds that people who say no dont know what they want and if I force them theyll fall in love with me. Because like it or not but stories do educate people. And if they educate them in the wrong morality like rape is okay! then bad things happen see girls who were killed because of SoG reenactment scenes,Elsanna,cqooyt7,-1,t5_2zwxc

We all know tumblr isnt the best for conversations so Reddit will be the main place to gather. Then you can start a poll with a few popular fics as options but also a blank spot where other people can suggest fics that werent listed. Show the winning fic and announce it. Give it a week after announcemet to get word out and allow people to catch up on the fic then start the disccusion. Edit To start a poll you can just start a selfpost and have someone sticky it. Highest voted comment with a suggested fic wins. You can even turn the post into a contest mode that hides the points so that way people have go scroll and look for a comment instead of a highest voted commet being on top. ,Elsanna,crxeut6,10,t5_2zwxc

4232774,0,t1_cs2c4dd,Based on the stock the KA fanbase arent buying enough.  If they were there would be more KA merch.  Its the Elsanna Olaf merch thats restocked because it sells.  Note that its not just Disney.  Mattel is also watching what people buy since they licensed the characters from Disney.  Mattel made KA  pack set retailing for .  I havent seen it on Target and Walmart for over  months and these stores have dropped the price to  for an online purchase.  Im guessing they are trying to get rid of excess stock.  If this  pack sold a lot Mattel will churn out more KA merch.  Instead Mattel made more Elsanna merch.  BTW I dont recommend the Mattel dolls.  Get the Disney dolls.  They are better made and more poseable.  Zazzle also has a license.  Most of their designs are Elsanna based.  If theres K or H they are usually part of a group.Olaf not K not H is the male hero that boys like.  None of my younger girl cousins have a K doll.  They pair Anna with Elsa so those are the dolls that they asked their parents to buy.  Actually some of my younger boy cousins like Elsa and Anna too but instead of buying dolls they ask for balls clothes or bags with Elsanna on it.,Elsanna,cs2q1iv,7,t5_2zwxc

4425907,0,t1_csnruo6,I think its because the canonverse isnt really all that fleshed out. Theres a lot of details left ambiguous. There arent a lot of characters to work with there isnt a lot of interesting opportunities for conflict built into the setting other than reusing Hans and his family or making the incest the main conflict and the magictechnology is loosely defined.They use crossbows instead of guns which were definitely a thing by the mid s the tentative time period of Frozen where do the trolls come from whats a fire crystal? and how common is magic are people like Elsa and the trolls a rarity in this world or relatively commonplace??Its easier to just create an alternate setting with rules you define then to try and mold the given one into what youre looking for to tell a story. AUs just give an author a lot more creative freedom.Also AUs are easier to read. Canonverse fics read back to back tend to blend together for me. Whereas that is almost never the case with any alternate setting so I can just charge through any number of AU fics I assume Im not the only person like this. Also for people like me that only really read Elsanna AUs just have more opportunities to be interesting and surprising.,Elsanna,csoksqh,3,t5_2zwxc

Focus so much on him even in Elsanna stories? I really dont follow this.Doesnt he have a huge negative luggage from the movie up to the fanfics with blackmail rape torture killing etc?I mean... even the author I am proofreading for is seriously considering turning a k story about Elsa and Anna into a period where Anna is with Hans...

Ive seen some arguments talking about how Elsa simply runs away from her problems but mentioning from your reply that was only because she was stubborn enough to think people would be better off without her and she selfdepreciated herself too much. But ugh...I swear if she was a King rather than a Queen i dont even think people would give a fuck and then call King Elias such a GREAT role model...I think from my perspective the movies heavy focus on Anna and Kristoff yeah too much of them and not enough sisterly stuff going on kinda detracted from what Elsa was going through making some people dismiss her understandable actions during and after her coronation.,Elsanna,cwhiztg,1,t5_2zwxc

6548050,0,t1_czwcids,Oh in Nausicaa and Asbels case Id say its not a romantic connection at all. Ive met people who view it that way because shes a girl and hes a boy but I didnt feel any romantic undertones at all. In Spirited Away on the other hand its love that breaks the Hakus spell so thats more on the fence. I agree with you that there can be shades of things and its not always clear cut. And again I think its also because Miyazaki mostly writes about children and he wants his films to have that wonderful innocent tone they have. Annnd now I seem to have completely lost the point I was making. What point was I making? I guess that the author or creator generally has it in mind whether its platonicromantic but hey you can interpret it however you like I guess.

I take special dislike towards the line of Annas thoughts where she claims to be unable to hold back anymore. That sounds like a stalker who just wants this one person and cant they see how true their love is?? and theyll realise when I show them cue rape because no thats not how love nor people work.so yeah. not fruipit approved.ofc that doesnt mean other people cant like it. its just that i dont. ,Elsanna,d0lqeet,1,t5_2zwxc

7338133,0,t3_4fv9m8,Yeah and this can be even more difficult to avoid when somebody sets it in a modernday you. It requires them to build a complete Universe with a world and Side characters who are believable and engaging. You have to care about the universe and the other characters in order to care about how the overarching plot ends and not just if and when Elsa and Anna fall in love. I think stolen ice did a good job with its world and building the story and searching for a perfect day is also doing a great job with story building especially in a realistic sense where the characters are tackling the real issue of an incestuous relationship in modern society. Its definitely obvious that some stories are pretty much elsanna romance with plot thrown in to make it seeing to make it be more than just a generic romance story. I dont mind that if its what Im in the mood to read its great.I definitely noticed many more plotdriven stories and not as many characterdriven stories. Fresh characters driven stories can always you know fall into the Trap of being very Meandering as they focus on how the characters live and grow as opposed to a plot or an abscess single obstacle for the characters to face. My story is heavily characterdriven to the point where I have no doubt people will complain that it is too Meandering butt thats just the nature of it. You are also seems kind of like a characterdriven story the characters really arent fighting against too many external obstacles its more a study of the characters and how they lived interact with each other and grow.,Elsanna,d2can7n,1,t5_2zwxc

8343365,0,t1_d5kg6zi,Thought it would be XD And by personalised gift card I mean Id write or draw on it with a Sharpie. Obviously in a way that wouldnt interfere with the magnetic stripAnd thank you! I agree that we definitely should for some of us this is a hobby and for some its more. I just didnt know how it would be received by the redditors is all.,Elsanna,d5kh3ll,2,t5_2zwxc
8365048,1,t1_d5n1kqu,Said user is probably yucking it up reading this thread. Its not the first time and it should be a red flag to mods when that person complains. Maybe in the future when that same person or a new account helpfully points out a violation and cites the guidelines weigh the impact of adhering to those guidelines against the kind of drama and contention it will likely bring. Consider  had that thread not been removed it would have silently disappeared onto page .,Elsanna,d5n6krw,3,t5_2zwxc
8398313,0,t1_d5r5r55,Nothing has really changed. A rule that was previously being enforced has been clarified and written into the sidebar.

9717104,0,t1_da9wnl4,This to the max.Im not against authors getting money for their hard work since its basically the same as fan art and people pay for art commissions all the time. But to leave your fans in the dust for so long and then come back asking them to give you money for updates? It doesnt sit well with me personally. If im going to spend my money its going to be on those active and hard working individuals still within the fandom. A fandom is more than just dolla dolla bill signs.,Elsanna,daaue4o,3,t5_2zwxc
9819380,0,t3_5frhq6,Also as Ive said before anything that happens can contribute to Elsanna. If Elsa stays single it will be just like now. If Elsa gets a girlfriend it will inspire love triangles threesomes poly etc. If Elsa gets a boyfriend we riot and use our free time in jail to produce more Elsanna content. ,Elsanna,danhfal,3,t5_2zwxc
