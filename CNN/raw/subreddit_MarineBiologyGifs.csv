5978735,0,t1_cy382f1,Yeah I hate this It cant eat you therefore its harmless mentality. Jeez. An elephant isnt going to try and eat me either. Does that mean it couldnt hurt me if it tried? Granted manta rays look a lot more harmless than other creatures people claim are harmless Im looking at you whale sharks,MarineBiologyGifs,cy3cczp,8,t5_3abta

7140751,0,t1_d1pszqe,For the love of god stop with the straw man argumentation its such a bad way to debate its sickening.The most recent IUCN assessment from  reports on the North East Atlantic stock while the FOA assessment from  is unfortunately from the western stock. I did not see that before now but it still shows significant improvement on the SSB. And so does the report from the eastern stockSo by poiting out my initial error youve actually helped me show that the entire North Atlantic stock is showing improvements.I have an agenda yes and that is to show that the effort done to improve and conserve the north atlantic bluefin population is helping despitealthough there is still a targeted fishery happening. And that is a good thing in my opinion. I really cant see why this is bad? Everybody wins the tunas the fishermen and the consumers.,MarineBiologyGifs,d1ptrp4,-1,t5_3abta
