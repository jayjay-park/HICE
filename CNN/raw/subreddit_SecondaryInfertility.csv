1345926,0,t1_cil0d7g,Im already getting pressure to wean too. Not just to formula either apparently because my sister and I switched to whole milk at  months thats what I should do for Charlotte. Never mind medical opinion or the fact my sister and I are both plagued with health issues...  My only dislike for formula beyond finally feeling less body hatred because EBF is working is that its way more work. Cleaning bottles carrying extra supplies around the inability to comfort nursenurse to sleep... I have SO much respect for formula moms because they have so much more to do than I do and they have to pay out the nose to do it.,SecondaryInfertility,cil16l9,1,t5_32cyv
2222047,0,t3_2kksu0,I get the same way. I want two kids but going through everything again scares the shit out of me.I also get jealous of people who had successful clomidIUIIVFetc. Because they know what worked. While I feel very fortunate that I ended up with a surprise pregnancy the fact that it took five damn years scares me shitless. I dont know why I got pregnant that cycle. I dont know how to replicate it. Bah.,SecondaryInfertility,clm9xcr,6,t5_32cyv
2306536,0,t1_clwpxrw,Hi thanks for the response. Im  and DH is . I have never explored endometriosis... I dont have overly painful periods and they didnt find any cysts on the ultrasounds both of which I thought were symptoms of endo. But I suppose like anything it can go relatively asymptomatic despite the whole infertility symptom  Anyways Ive used clear blue digital OPKs and wondfos Internet cheapies I temped and charted for months up until this last cycle where I just used OPKs. I ended up at the RE initially because my LP was only  days and my CD testing had progesterone at less than . Although that was the day before AF showed due to the short LP. Weve now done two clomid rounds mg and progesterone x a day. I was hoping the meds would kinda kick my body into working again. But now I feel like its more serious than that as those didnt work. I know this sounds whiny but I hate the thought that IUI is a diagnostic tool. I almost dont care about the diagnosis I just want something to work! I dont want more and more rounds of diagnosis without any success  but I am sure thats the same feeling we all have. ,SecondaryInfertility,clwsyxn,1,t5_32cyv

8445239,0,t1_d5x0x9n,Welcome. Sorry that youre having a difficult time getting pregnant. My husbands count was a bit low as well. Hope you can have something happen in the next  months or else I hope you can find your answers at the doctors after. Before you go make sure you have your insurance in order and questions you want to ask. Be prepared fertility insurance can be a pain or out of pocket. ,SecondaryInfertility,d5x6y9y,1,t5_32cyv
