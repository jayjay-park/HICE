5099309,0,t1_cux8zkc,Weird. I am assuming that the middle of chapter  means the quarantine Mother Base missionspoiler? That was the first point in the entire game that my horn grew. I thought it had to be more than just killing soldiers since I would do it a lot.,moddergearsolid,cv0nnvs,1,t5_35o09

8423814,0,t1_d5sg214,Yeah it would be nice if they communicated any of this to the player. The resistance stuff gets really weird with vehicles. When selecting a vehicle to deploy with it gives speed and durability bars to show performance differences. Well I havent noticed a difference in speed between vehicles in the same class MBT APC etc. and their health and damage resistance appear to be the same.Additionally the displayed durability increase for the ACC when equipping Applique Armor is a raw health buff rather than damage resistance. So Im left scratching my head wondering if those are AI values being displayed for vehicles or if theyre just meaningless values for performance differences that were never implemented.Bullets seem to have a multiplier that reduce their damage to AFVs and explosives seem to have one that either increases it or reduces the AFVs resistance. e.g. the G FB MR launcher does more damage than its raw stat when hitting the ground directly beneath DWalkers chassis.,moddergearsolid,d5uio8z,1,t5_35o09
