6762542,0,t3_48dro7,source my collectionThis photo is interesting as it shows Panzer Spahtruppen w Infantry assault badgewound badgeiron cross. The other has Bronze Panzer Assault Badge with what possibly could be a Legion Condor Panzer Badge. At first it was discussed that it possibly was a Silver wound badge but it doesnt have the charactheristics and it should be worn in a different location. He also earned the Ostfront medal.

I just cant find a match and have been searching through the various German ww optics off and on since last night. ,GermanWW2photos,d0ogdes,1,t5_3cmw4
