2670132,0,t3_2qkzvp,My boyfriend and I go to Hollywood horror nights every year. Tickets tend to go on sale around September and the biggest advice I can give would be that you have to get the VIP passes. Totally worth the money to not stand in the  hour lines plus you get a buffet included and  alcoholic drinks.,universalstudios,cn73yk2,1,t5_2so0t

4925362,0,t1_cufc5va,The th of September or October? September is the first night I dont think it will be sold out.  You will have a lot of diehard guests there and the scareactors wont be bored with it yet.  Even October th is a Sunday so the crowds wont be completely crazy.You can tell how busy the night is by the pricing.  The higher the cost the more popular it is. If you really want to get in all of the houses you may want to look into the HHN express pass you have to buy the one exclusively for HHN the day one doesnt work.  Although you may not necessarily need it if you are going in September it is pretty chill early in the season.  Just do the rides during the day not during HHN.  The long ride lines will take up valuable time you could spend in houses.For more details you can also check out rhhn,universalstudios,cufdpqu,1,t5_2so0t

As the years have gone on I think they should just drop the lost continent theme altogether and tie it in with Potter and have at least one more Jurassic ride attraction although now with Kong there i feel they could just call this the lost continent and tie it in with prehistoric attractions and kong,universalstudios,d5y2gg5,1,t5_2so0t

9685689,0,t3_5clofx,I went during the celebration this year. We went to Universal in  about two weeks before the celebration.I felt like there was a huge difference in crowd level even in the non HP areas. Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade were less enjoyable to me because they were SO full. It was hard to move around and the single rider lines were a much longer wait than what we experienced the year prior. Non celebration weekend was about  minutes max for Forbidden Journey and Gringotts. This year it was upwards of  minutes for both. Were going back in January and made a point to not go during the celebration. All of the costumes were super cool to see though.,universalstudios,da6ysqb,1,t5_2so0t
9713458,0,t1_daaass9,gt I just want some kind of token apology from Universal for making such a poor decision to close a ride during Winter.You have no idea what they are fixing. It could be a critical fix that they cannot put off any longer. I road it a few weeks ago and I can tell you the different between riding it in the morning and riding it in the afternoon was stunning. In the morning it was running fine. In the afternoon? Movement seemed a lot more jockey animatronics  were moving strangely or not at all. The misters and heat effects werent working at all. Some lighting effects were turned off or dimmer than in the morning.  It was obvious multiple things were wrong and it detracted for the experience.Sure its not great timing but there is no way Universal is siting back and just laughing as they close one of their top rides right as December starts.  They arent out to get you and the sooner you take the histrionics out of your argument the better off youll be pleading your points to the poor Universal employee who has to deal with you. You literally asked how to  squeaky wheeling it. Thats entitlement. Instead just be an adult and let them know you are bummed out and ask if there is anything they can do...but dont be an asshole and push it with everything else youve written in this thread essentially wildly accusing Universal of plotting against people. I can tell you that you wont be the only one bitching about this. And any person you speak to on this issue isnt the one that made the decision. So do a  degree and flip the conversation on them. Be nice. Dont be a squeaky wheel. Be real. I did that on my first trip after I fell and twisted my ankle at Universal. I owned up to how much a klutz I was and they instantly empathized with me and gave me unlimited express passes. And dont be greedy. Sure this really sucks. But it is what it is.Edit And also they likely cannot wait until January that is when A Celebration of Harry Potter is I believe. Lots more pissed off fans then.,universalstudios,daae6qe,2,t5_2so0t

10036063,0,t3_5jd8ic,HP fan here and went for my honeymoon last year  Ride the Hogwarts Express you will need the park to park admission If shes a hardcore fan I would recommend going through the Universal Studios vs Islands of Adventure side first bc it goes along with the books entering through the leaky cauldron. Butterbeer is delicious  served frozenslushylike coldhot and ice cream. Tip buy it from the  broomsticksleaky cauldron rather than the individual stands outside bc they are typically less crowdedvery little wait. Try the butterbeer souvenir cup I think shell love it. I use mine at home all the time I know to some this is cheesy but I was  when I went and I bought and interactive wand at Ollivanders. Interactive meaning there are stations around both HP parks where you can wave you wand and certain magical things happen. Take the map to Knockturn alley and put it under the black light and it will show you hidden stations to use wand. They are pricey but my husband not so much of a HP fan and I enjoyed it. If your staying at an onsite Universal Resort take advantage of the  hour opening of the HP parks prior to park opening. ,universalstudios,dbfq4nw,2,t5_2so0t

10433648,0,t3_5ofvee,One of the reasons why they used screens is because ROK is on  acres and they cannot do much with  acres to play with. I believe what they did if you think about the limitations they faced they did a great job. Sure it was a bit disappointing a few scenes here and there would have made it better but I thought it was a good addition to IOA.Now you also have to consider that Universal uses screens for a majority of their rides because Universal prefers action rides rather than boat rides like Disney. Its impossible to fall  stories without screens is it not? or its impossible to do a Kong V  Dinos without screens too? Disney has practical effects because their rides lack action. Their new rides Pandora Land will use screens too for Flight of Passage AKA Soarn . and the Boat ride will use screens as the backgrounds while practical effects would be plants ,universalstudios,dcqq26v,1,t5_2so0t

11310409,0,t3_61f6h6,I think its great that US keeps innovating and expanding and moving forward.  Im not one of those who is nostalgic and has to have the past rides stick around forever.  So when I hear that they are taking down Dragon Challenge I think I need to find time to get there and ride both of the coasters one more time.  What bothers me is removing the coasters and replacing them with another dark coaster ride. Change the coaster great lets go.  But please get back into the outdoor thrill rides.  There is certainly room in IOA I mean look at an overhead of how they wedged RRR in US.I expect US to do great things in the WWOHP area.  Lets go!,universalstudios,dfe0n27,9,t5_2so0t
