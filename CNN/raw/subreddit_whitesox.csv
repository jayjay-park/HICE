5115272,0,t1_cv2juef,I just did some more number crunching and while it is imperfect if you look at his pitch count and the  of strikes hes throwing per game it shows that he is throwing strikes  of the time to Minnesota and  of the time to Detroit Cleveland and Kansas City combined. So it does not appear he is throwing significantly more strikes to Minnesota.In addition Minnesota is hitting . against Chris Sale compared to everybody else hitting .. I know it is pretty hard to believe that Sale is tipping his pitches and one team found out but I think its more unrealistic to think that one team just happens to be comprised of players that can hit one of the best pitchers in baseball unbelievably well while everyone else cant do anything.As far as the why would they keep it quiet why wouldnt they? They stand at a significant advantage if they can dominate Chris Sale but everybody else in the division can as well. Edit Im not saying he  has some tell that Minnesota figured out but I dont believe that we can chalk it up to Minnesota just having his number or seeing it well off of him. Honestly it is either he has a tell or it is all mental at this point. Im not discounting the mental thing but I dont think we should count out him physically having a tell. Statistically speaking the Minnesota thing is baffling because if he didnt face them  games this year he would probably be the front runner for Cy Young.Edit II Also The Twins team batting average is . good for rd in MLB. Their OPS is rd in the league their OBP th and their slugging th. If it was as simple as strategy vs Sale I would think that teams that have an offense in the upper tier like Detroit would be able to mash Sale. Like I said the Twins thing is baffling.,whitesox,cv2ky58,1,t5_2ro52

Im sure that every mod here is just too busy to fulfill the tasks and responsibilities they took on though.

You act as if the guy is taking home  million dollars. LOL. After agent fees taxes and etc the guy is giving away a substantial amount of income  especially given that in all likelihood he may never work again. He can probably live off his MLB pension but the guy is for sure downgrading his lifestyle. And no its not the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility because LaRoche is not spending the same way he did as a kid or minor leaguer and hes not consuming the same way. Its cute to attempt to sound smart but it doesnt fit here. You are diminishing money as you make more which is absurd most people SPEND more when they make more.The guy is walking away from  of his career earnings.

7429639,0,t1_d2mgyhz,In  the White Sox had a game rained out earlier in the year against the Tigers but it would only get played if it mattered in the standings. The Sox had to beat Cleveland to force the makeup game to be played which they did then they had to win the makeup game to force a tiebreaker with the Twins since they would have identical records they did. They went home and had a blackout game where the fans wore all black  and the Sox won  off a Jim Thome moonshot to center and an amazing pitching performance by John Danks putting the Sox in the playoffs.So  consecutive win or go home games vs  different teams  in  straight days won by the Sox. Was a great time.So the picture wasnt from the blackout game but the way they got in made it special. To this day I dont mind that they got eliminated because the last week of the season was just awesome. ,whitesox,d2mpb3k,5,t5_2ro52

Ive been talking with the White Sox about the group tickets were currently looking at bleacher seats  each  tax. now the problem is that they typically want all the money up front which with  people showing interest I cant afford to cover and take the hit if people decide not to come. So I suggested getting the sections reserved and people can simply enter a promo code when they go to order through checkout but was told theyll get back to me. The dates are creeping up on us here so Ill call back to see where this is at. Worst case scenario we just all buy tickets for the same bleachers section But ideally Id like to get the group rate and guaranteed seating arrangements.

8362829,0,t1_d5mw3ix,I certainly dont trade Chris Sale. There are other assets on the roster. Right now the position players need rebuilding... the bullpen has been a problem to and thats one aspect of a team you can rebuild in one year. You dont trade a generational talent in baseball. It rarely ever works out in the favor of the team that did it.Right now the White Sox have a strength  their starting pitching. They really only have to fill holes in the field and not worry about their rotation for  years. Thats a real advantage to have. By trading Sale and Quintana you now have to rebuild the entire roster which is a much taller feat. If you want to argue that Quintana should be traded fine. That seems reasonable and he could bring back a haul of talent and the Sox still have Fulmer and other arm talent in the organization to potentially replace him. Arguing to trade Sale is just silly and extremely wrecklessrisky.,whitesox,d5mwlmu,1,t5_2ro52
