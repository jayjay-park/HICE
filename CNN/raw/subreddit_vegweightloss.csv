10777933,0,t3_5u4zlj,Ive been vegetarian for  years and I have to be extremely strict about counting calories to avoid gaining weight. This is either because my diet is more carbheavy now or because I was still a teenager when I ate meat so my metabolism was faster. A lot of people assume vegetarian automatically equals healthy but you can live entirely on pizza fries and cake and be a vegetarian. ,vegweightloss,ddrnzcx,10,t5_3j024
