7700766,0,t1_d3h505t,Makes sense one of the logs specifically mentioned they did the same thing moving one stack over and having good luck.It would really stink if you didnt come away with the find though reminds me of how fickle some search through this big pile of rocks and hope you get lucky caches can be. I was hoping there was something we may have missed that would have otherwise led you straight to the cache shelf. Brute force searching seems like a smidge of a let down after solving the puzzle only to still not have an exact location.,geocachingpuzzles,d3hiy3s,3,t5_3bqm1
8580932,0,t3_4x2liu,Solved and got the green light.First off check your answers again well the last one at least.I dont get how jumble gets to be a clue.  I am familiar with the newspaper game and theres a mention of using an anagram solver in one of the logs which confused me more given my actual path to the solution.This is a substitution puzzle. Ill stop here for now but let me know if you need another push.,geocachingpuzzles,d6e79y7,2,t5_3bqm1
8871821,0,t3_51o7hf,You have some of the answers wrong just look at the west degree youre getting. The first one in there isnt Temple of Jaguars its High Temple according to my quick reverse image search. Theres something else wrong though as the geocheck doesnt give correct changing that. Review your image searches and try to be more thorough cheking more pages for exact coincidences.,geocachingpuzzles,d7e9nhd,1,t5_3bqm1
