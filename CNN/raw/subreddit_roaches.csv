1814144,0,t3_2f4ixx,pretty straight forward. The first step is to buy the roaches then make it work until they breed. you can buy them online or try to get a user here to sell you some. Several of the users have mentioned wanting to sell some off.If they are not breeding it is because they need warmer temps if they are having trouble shedding it is because they need higher humidity.Other than that it is pretty hard to mess up. A plastic tub a heating pad and hiding places usually egg crates which can be purchased in a link in the sidebar.Here is an old picture of my set up  since then I have lost the styrofoam and just have  tub.Let me know if you have any questions.,roaches,ck7sa3d,2,t5_2xafw

No need to waste the one time adhesive when later on your probably going to switch from a  gallon glass tank to something more efficient or bigger to support a good size colony. ,roaches,cqqy5a7,2,t5_2xafw
4961381,0,t1_cujvp1h,Have you seen what a roach looks like after going through a washer and dryer? Im not sure and cant find images or descriptions about what a roach would look like if still in tact after going through a washer and dryer. What Im worried about it that the roach was fried in the dryer and clung to the old fleece blanket. Its sort of in the shape of a roach and about  long and  wide and looks like a mini porcuphine. The resolution isnt great but the spike things are the same size all over and pretty evenly dispersed. Im not sure that work happen with the spike things you get in the grass.,roaches,cujx637,1,t5_2xafw
