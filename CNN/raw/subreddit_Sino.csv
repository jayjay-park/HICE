That is to say overall the Chinese energy policy is definitely becoming greener and heavily investing in renewables and coal use is likely going to continue to drop but the construction of new coal plants when theyre not really needed is probably a remnant of past policies and some faults of the system. So IMO the title is a bit of a false one  the glut of coal fired plants doesnt raise doubts about Chinas overall energy priorities its a phenomenon of the countrys shift in economic and energy policy which has yet to fully change gears. Its weird in the preparations for the Paris climate talks it seems like theres been a barrage of articles coming out trying to paint China as less committed to energy reform and mitigating climate change  and all of them have been half correct with decent premises but shaky conclusions.Also it is worth considering how efficient these new coal plants are compared to older ones and also how many of the older ones would be closed down. The fact is that coals going to continue being a significant part of Chinas energy for the foreseeable future but it is the overall shape of Chinas energy consumption which matters. ,Sino,cwxil4i,3,t5_38jyn

5748700,0,t3_3tvztm,Can the US and China transcend their differences?Why Washington should embrace Beijings new type of majorpower relationshipNovember   AM ETby Helen H. Wanggt At this weeks APEC summit in Manila President Barack Obama sharply criticized China for building artificial islands in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. But instead of calling out China Obama should have taken the opportunity to reconsider Chinese President Xi Jinpings proposal for a new type of majorpower relationship.gt The Obama administration was concerned when Xi first raised this concept in  when he was still Chinas vice president. Does that mean that China expects to share power equally with the United States? What signal would that send to U.S. allies?gt In his  meeting with Obama Xi Jinping defined the new type of majorpower relationship as no confrontation mutual respect and winwin cooperation. This proposition marks a break away from the zerosum game mentality and serves American interests as well as the interests of the world.gt However all Xi Jinpings benevolent messages such as winwin shared future and interdependence are falling on deaf ears. Americans tend to view anything the Chinese say with suspicion perhaps for good reason. China has repeatedly claimed that it will never pursue hegemony. Yet the Communist Party itself is the hegemon within China. Beijing has a lot of work to do in order to convince the international community that it would behave differently on the world stage.gt For the U.S. however embracing the new type of majorpower relationship does not diminish American leadership nor does it mean that the U.S. needs to share power with China equally.gt Americas closest ally the United Kingdom has engaged in a new type of relationship with China without worrying about what the U.S. thinks. The British now call themselves Chinas best partner in the West. In an interview with CCTV Lionel Barber editor of the Financial Times said that the British government has made a deliberate decision not only to engage China but also to support the new international institutions that China is creating.gt The U.K. was the first Western country to join the Chinaled Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB despite opposition from the U.S. Other U.S. allies such as Germany and France followed suit. Fifty countries including Australia and South Korea were present as founding members in June.gt The British have sent a clear message that they will not follow the U.S.s semicontainment policy on China. During Xis recent state visit Downing Street discussed two important initiatives with Beijing that will have significant implications for geopolitics.gt The first is the LondonShanghai stockconnect. The U.K. and China are jointly conducting a feasibility study to link their two stock exchanges. George Osborne the British chancellor has championed making London a dominant center for offshore Chinese currency trading. China will soon issue yuandenominated bonds in London.gt The yuan has already surpassed the euro as the second largest settlement currency. As the Chinese currency becomes more prominent London is keen to facilitate the internationalization of the yuan  a potential challenge to the dollarbased global financial system.gt The second initiative is a ChinaEuropean Union free trade feasibility study. The backdrop of the ChinaEU free trade bloc is Chinas new Silk Road project billed as One Belt One Road.gt The new Silk Road entails investing billions of dollars in infrastructure and economic development across Eurasia linking China to Europe. It comprises one route on land and one at sea involving  countries along the way. If successful the Silk Road could open up markets in Central Asia that are largely untapped while shortening the distance between China and Europe.gt These two initiatives are in their early stages and could take years to come to fruition. However their potential impacts are monumental.gt At APEC China is actively pushing a Free Trade Area of Asia Pacific FTAAP in response to the U.S. led TransPacific Partnership TPP a free trade agreement involving  nations in the AsiaPacific region but excluding China.gt Clearly the U.S. and China are beginning to engage in a dangerous rivalry that can result in loss on both sides.gt The U.S. needs to reassess its China policy. Embracing the new type of majorpower relationship does not mean the U.S. will cave in to Chinas growing prowess. On the contrary it would demonstrate a superior confidence and send a strong signal that the U.S. does not take its leadership for granted.gt Furthermore embracing this concept demonstrates strategic thinking that by working with China the U.S. would be able to address many issues more constructively and effectively including disputes in the South China Sea cyber security and counterterrorism efforts.gt Here are three specific actions that the U.S. should take immediatelygt First America should join the AIIB. The bank was created as a result of the U.S. Congress repeated refusal to increase funding for the World Bank. Instead of viewing the AIIB as a rival the U.S. needs to take steps to incorporate it into existing institutions.gt Chinas invitation to the U.S. to join the bank is still open. Although it may be late as a founding member it is better late than never. It may be a diplomatic win for China but it will be a bigger win for China if the U.S. stays out. By joining the AIIB the U.S. will be able to play an instrumental role from the beginning.gt Second the U.S. should grant China the opportunity to eventually join the TPP. This will prevent China from creating a separate trade bloc in the same region.gt Since the TPP sets high standards in areas such as subsidies labor standards and Internet freedom that China cannot immediately meet the U.S. can set up a phased process for Chinese membership. The argument that Chinas economy is not mature enough to join the TPP is nonsense as Vietnam a founding member is lagging behind China in every economic dimension.gt The TPP sets the bar for future international trade agreements and should be a guideline for the ChinaEU free trade agreement. This will force China to speed up its reforms in the financial sector and stateowned enterprises and maybe eventually to open up the Internet.gt Third the U.S. should consider supporting Chinas new Silk Road project. The project encompasses countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq that are likely to harbor terrorists. Since China will invest significantly in these areas it will have a shared interest with the U.S. in maintaining their stability.gt William Overholt a senior research fellow at the Harvard Asia Center suggests that the U.S. could coordinate with China to develop a comprehensive and balanced economic and military strategy to fight terrorism. Neither the U.S. nor China can do this alone.gt Embracing the new type of majorpower relationship will only put the U.S. in a stronger position to address global problems and to exercise its leadership in an increasingly multipolar world.gt ,Sino,cx9okng,2,t5_38jyn
5753022,0,t3_3tyce0,China displays its strongest drone CH that can carry  kg eyes export marketsPosted on  PM IST Nov  gt Beijing China has displayed its strongest combat and reconnaissance drone in a bid to look for export markets for it after the unmanned aerial vehicle that can fly with a weight of  kg made its first flight this year.gt Chinese military displayed the CH combat and reconnaissance drone developed by China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics under China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp at Shenzhen in Guangdong province yesterday in an attempt to attract more buyers for its combat drones.gt The CH made its first flight in August becoming the heaviest and strongest military drone in China staterun China Daily reported.gt Compared with other military drones that usually have a maximum takeoff weight of less than  kg the CH is much more powerful and is able to fly with a weight of  kg and carry  kg of equipment and weapons according to engineers at the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics.gt The larger carrying capacity enables the CH to have more reconnaissance equipment so it can detect any given target within a radius of  km said Lan Wenbo a chief engineer of the aircraft at the academy.gt Ou Zhongming head of the unmanned aircraft project at the academy said the CH is large enough to host an advanced radar that can penetrate thick walls or cave to find out terrorists hiding there.gt Currently ground control operators need to transfer such information to drones before launching a strike he said. Considering the unspoken rule in Chinas defence sector that it never publicly shows advanced weapons solely designed for the Peoples Liberation Army the public debut of CH at the China Shenzhen International Unmanned Vehicle Systems Trade Fair shows China is eager to sell it the report said.gt We have sold the CH to several foreign nations and now we plan to launch the export version of the CH to the international market. It can perform airtoground strike reconnaissance and transport operations Shi Wen chief designer of the CH series at the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics said.gt Shi did not disclose which countries have introduced the CH series but earlier reports quoted Vasily Kashin a senior analyst with the Moscowbased Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies as saying that Egypt Saudi Arabia and Iraq have deployed drones from the CH family.gt ,Sino,cxa7u7d,1,t5_38jyn

6295482,0,t3_41uob1,J striker or interceptor?gt Backgroundgt Since CAC prototype no.  made its first flight on the th of January  the Chengdu J has been a source of great speculation and discussion in the defence community and general media Waldron . The emergence of what was clearly a large stealthy fighter aircraft from a country not traditionally viewed as a serious hightechnology military competitor to the United States prompted a range of reactions in western news media and defence experts encompassing an extensive range of emotions from surprise and anxiety to hostility and dismissal.gt Interestingly most reports of J eventually came to speculate that its role and associated capabilities either revolved around that of a dedicated strike aircraft Reed b Trimble  or as a dedicated interceptor aircraft Axe b. Needless to say proper assessment of the Js intended role is vital for an accurate projection of the future capabilities of the Chinese Air Force.gt This entry intends to sample commentary and relevant news media of Js potential roles as a striker an interceptor and an air superiority fighter and critically examine the potential viability and sensibility of Js design for those roles as well as the place of such roles in context of the Chinese Air Forces potential requirements.gt This paper is not intended to address Js role in context of any substantive aerodynamic analyses given the complexity of aerodynamic design and the inability to properly assess this without access to a wind tunnel an accurate model and a few experienced aerospace engineers.gt J as a strikergt Js potential striker role has been emphasized greatly in the defence watching discourse often in context of the larger perceived Chinese military doctrine of Anti AccessArea Denial or Counter Intervention capabilities Barnes Hodge amp Page . In many cases J is even described not only as a simple stealthy striker but also as a naval striker for specific targeted use against United States supercarriers Reed b Trimble .gt There are compelling reasons to believe why the Chinese military may be interested in fielding a stealthy strike aircraft and the requirement to counter United States carrier battlegroups are also well accepted. But whether J is the plane to fulfil such a task is another question.gt Any stealth aircraft intended for the strike role should optimally field a large diameter weapons bay to allow it to deploy a variety of munitions including nonpowered guided bombs or glide bombs as well as powered guided weapons such as air launched cruise missiles which are typically of a larger diameter than unpowered counterparts. For instance the F Joint Strike Fighter was designed from the outset with large diameter weapon bays Figure . to accommodate powered guided weapons such as the Joint Strike Missile Kongsberg. By comparison the F is limited to Small Diameter Bombs and kg class Joint Direct Attack Munitions as a consequence of having a weapons bay with less depth Figure ..gt Js weapon bay is shallower than that of the F and from current picture evidence it appears most similar to Fs weapon bay in dimensions as well as configuration Figure .. The configuration of Js air intakes are also possibly indicative of the maximum depth of its main weapons bay stealthy aircraft such as the J F and F all feature air intakes which partially overlay their main belly weapon bays restricting the maximum possible depth of the bays due to constraints of a minimum functional air intakeduct area to supply their engines. Other stealthy aircraft such as the Northrop YF and Russian T feature air intakes which do not overlay their belly weapon bays and instead run parallel Figures . and . permitting the bays to potentially feature a substantially greater depth.gt In the likely event that J does lack a sufficiently deep weapons bay to field large diameter powered weapons J will be limited to deploying relatively short range glide bombs. Such glide bombs will also be limited in number given the length of its weapons bay appears little greater than that of F. Modern glide bombs such as the SDB feature extended ranges of over km compared to legacy guided bombs and supersonic deployment speeds may extend that range even further but even then the J will be limited to deploying only a likely maximum of  SDB class weapons at a distance of far less than km from its target which is inside the likely engagement envelope of future and some current surface to air missiles not to mention lying well within airspace monitored by AEWampC and defended by combat air patrols. This therefore casts great scepticism over Js potential role as a striker and whether the Chinese Air Force would consider development of such an expensive but inefficient strike aircraft in the first placegt Of course one may envision the Chinese Air Force seeking to procure a small diameter powered weapon able to fit within Js weapons bay such as a reduced diameter JSMesque weapon or a SPEAR III equivalent or the folding wing KhUshKE missile which some western media claim China has purchased from Russia but for which there is no indication of in the Chinese military watching community. However such missiles would only make the best of a poor strike aircraft design as they would be limited to small warheads and relatively short range compared to full sized powered weapons and far inferior to missiles such as the new YJ Lin amp Singer . Therefore if J were to field even a token naval strike role it would require development of a new generation of small sized powered missiles of which J can only carry a small number whose efficacy against a well defended United States carrier battlegroup would very doubtful at best.gt Considering the above it becomes difficult to envision J as being designed primarily as a stealthy striker. Indeed the reasons for suggesting J was a striker rested on debatable logic in the first place. Some commentary have suggested J may be a striker due to its supposedly large size Figure . however later satellite analysis have shown that the J is almost certainly under . meters in length Figure . which is meaningfully smaller than early assertions of J being in the same class as the . meters long F Axe b Kopp amp Goon .gt However this is not to suggest that J cannot be a viable and capable strike aircraft. For instance the F has demonstrated that even though it can only carry a relatively light strike load of only JDAMs or SDBs it can still provide a potent strike capability by leveraging supercruise sensor fusion and a very low observable design. But Fs primary role is that of an air superiority fighter and it is equipped with a weapons bay designed to match that purpose. Therefore it is most accurate to say Fs respectable strike capability arises despite the inherent limitations of the design of the actual airframe and its weapons bay dimensions rather than flourishing as a result of its design. In other words if the Chinese Air Force truly desired a stealthy aircraft for strike and naval strike there are a variety of other more sensible airframe designs and weapons bay configurations that could have been pursued first.,Sino,cz583zf,1,t5_38jyn

Haney commander of U.S. Strategic Command told an audience at the Center for a New American Security on January .gt The biggest challenges come from rival great powers which have the technical and financial wherewithal to challenge American power in space.gt Russias  military doctrine emphasized space as a crucial component of its defense strategy and Russia has publicly stated they are researching and developing counterspace capabilities to degrade disrupt and deny other users of space Haney said adding that Russias leaders also openly assert that Russian armed forces have antisatellite ASAT weapons conduct ASAT research and employ satellite jammers.gt Last year Haney said the Washington Times reported Russian President Putin as saying that Russia following the Chinese military is building stateoftheart weapons that would guarantee for Russia the fulfillment of space defense tasks for the period until .gt While Russiaand the Soviet Union before itmight have been Americas closest rivals in space these days the most dangerous challenge comes from Beijing. China like Russia has advanced directed energy capabilities that could be used to track or blind satellites and like Russia has demonstrated the ability to perform complex maneuvers in space Haney said. He addedgt In November China conducted its sixth test of a hypersonic strike vehicle and several news sources reported an ASAT the previous month. Of course many of us are still dealing with Chinas  ASAT test which created more than  pieces of debris adding significantly to the congested space environment. Well over  percent of this debris which litters one of the most utilized areas of space will affect space flight for many decades to come.gt But what can Washington do to counter these developments? The answer to that question is less clear.gt Haney laid out four main pointsgt First we must have a deeper broader understanding of our adversaries and potential adversaries. No matter the foe we must understand their capability and intent so that we can deny enemy action hold critical nodes at risk and prevent perceptions misperceptions and actions from escalating.gt Second we must view and fund space as a critical mission capability vs. an enabler. Our sensors command and control systems and Space Situational Awareness capabilities underpin our ability to maintain awareness. These resources are vital to the decisionmaking process and supporting forces around the globe.gt Third we must look at our military capabilities in a holistic manner and fully integrate them into our other elements of national power. We must have a whole of government approach and include our allies partners and commercial entities where appropriate.gt Finally we must increase readiness across the arena of strategic capabilities nuclear space and cyberspace.gt The United States is pursuing other technical solutions as well. Haney explainedgt We are working on several new capabilities both in low earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit. To enhance our capability of tracking objects in low earth orbit our Space Fence program will work in conjunction with the rest of our space surveillance network to provide the Joint Space Operations Center or JSpOC an integrated picture of the joint operating environment providing significantly improved uncued space surveillance capabilities.gt To further refine space situational awareness we are relocating a CBand radar to Australiain order to provide low earth orbit coverage in the Southern altitudes.  A major advance in geosynchronous space surveillance was the declaration of IOC of the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program that is providing improved situational awareness out to  miles. . . Future initiatives must build in resiliency and survivabilitywhether thats through disaggregation smaller less complex satellites or realtime command and control.gt The United States has a long way to go in securing its spacebased assets but Washington is making progress. While we still have a significant way to go I am delighted with how far this innovative solution has come. I cant tell you much of what we are doing due to classification of its operations but we are experimenting high velocity learning as we experiment in an environment with seamless participation of the DoD and intelligence community Haney said.gt Ultimately the United States must rely on deterrence in space if possible. The key is to make sure that potential adversaries understand that attacking U.S. space assets will come at a significant cost. At the end of the day we must ensure that we deter conflict from extending to outer space. As threats evolve we must continue to look for additional investments in the space portfolio. We simply cannot risk denied access to a domain that is so vital to U.S. national security Haney said. But if the worst should happen I am proud to tell you that U.S. Strategic Command is a ready force capable of delivering comprehensive warfighting solutions for our commander in chief should deterrence fail. Should we need to respond we will respond proportionally using all elements of our national power and that response will occur at a time domain and place of our choosing.gt Essentially the message from Washington is that an attack on U.S. space systems does not necessarily mean a response in kind. Like any other aggressive act the United States has the means to respond in many different waysincluding conventional military strikes. Which means an attack on a satellite might be met with a Tomahawk cruise missile launched at an enemys staging area.gt Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for the National Interest.gt gt ,Sino,czgaug7,1,t5_38jyn

By the way  of modern Vietnamese do not know Ch Nm or Classical Chinese and traditional Vietnamese histories and accounts like i Vit s k ton th were written in Classical Chinese. Their modern Vietnamese translations do not provide full context or the exact meaning.Nguyn is the Vietnamese reading of the Chinese surname  which originally was the name of a feudal region of the Shang dynasty in southeastern Gansu. It became used as a surname in China first and then the Vietnamese adopted the surname. Since most Vietnamese dont know Classical Chinese they dont know the etymology.Kinh is from the Chinese character for capital . It was used for ethnic Vietnamese because ethnic Vietnamese lived around the capital region while ethnic minorities lived at the frontiers.This blog is run by a historian of Southeast Asian history from University of Hawaii at Manoa.

6504289,0,t3_44p56u,I think governance needs to be placed in context of its development. As much as I like the current Western form of government successful democracies were almost all former colonial nations. Countries in Western Europe Canada US Australia and New Zealand acquired resources through colonization which essentially diverted wealth from colonies to their nation it was especially horrible for the African continent.Noncolonial states that demonstrate high degree of justice are Singapore S. Korea Japan Taiwan. All of those regions are relatively small states to govern. Furthermore all of those states became wealthy prior to changing its governance.One of the consistencies in fair government in my opinion is not necessarily form of governance itself but rather high degree of wealth per capita and relatively small income disparities with huge network of social safety nets. Wealth in general empowers citizens and a small income disparity disenfranchises the ultrarich while enfranchises the poor leading to an increased balance of power. Furthermore wealth creates leisure which allows people to have time to consider their options so the cost of survival shortterm incentive is small compared to fairness of the government longterm incentive.I mean the US did not have true democracy until the Civil Rights Act of  which is almost  years postWWII victory making it the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world. Prior to WWII status voting rights occurred in stages with huge amount of fraud and corruption. In Asia Singapore is authoritarian Hong Kongs government was by appointment Taiwan did not have its first election until  and was ruled until martial law until  S. Korea did not have free elections until  and Japan did not have multiparty election until . Granted theyre all relatively small states but they all performed better than India which was democratic since  and better than almost all South American nations.I think a Singaporean style government is likely to emerge because Chinese people seems to value efficiency and result over more abstract concepts like freedom but that may change.,Sino,czs3c2x,4,t5_38jyn

6571257,0,t3_45kzi8,I have advocated for a long time that China build pebble bed reactors to make nuclear power safer. Im glad therefore to hear that Chinas first pebble bed nuclear power plant will go online within  years. It is also heartening to hear that China intends to build many such nuclear power plants to drive down the cost. I did not read anything that says the technologies are Chinese indigenous technologies. It mentioned that the technology was developed in Germany. I hope the current pebble bed technologies are only based on Germany technologies while the specific parts and components of the reactors and pebbles are developed indigenously by Chinese scientists and engineers. Certainly indigenous technologies with indigenously owned IPR will reduce the cost significantly. Perhaps by a factor of  or more. That is if a nuclear reactor build with licensing agreement from German cost  billion a pebble bed nuclear reactor of the same quality and power output using Chinese indigenous IPR will cost only  billion yuan. China must also be able to produce the pebbles with indigenous IPR which will reduce the cost of fuel for many decades by several times. Importing foreign nuclear pebbles will be as costly as importing foreign oil. And the importation of foreign pebbles will subject to disruption due to wars and political machinations. Therefore China must be able to produce its own nuclear pebbles.Pebbles can contain U U or Th which can be bred into fissile materials and subsequently fissioned thus adding more fissile materials than first started with in terms of U or Pu. I hope the pebbles can be designed so as to increase the fissile materials by some  times or more. China is said to have some  tons of natural uranium most of which is U. If  of the natural uranium can be bred into fissile materials then each pebble bed nuclear reactor needs only . ton of natural uranium per year. This means  reactors producing some  billion KW need  tons of natural uranium per year which in turn means the  tons of natural uranium China has can last  years. As of  China had installed . billion KW of electric generation.The relative safety of the pebble bed nuclear reactors means they can be located closer to population centers thus eliminating the need to transmit the electricity over long distances. Also the pebble bed power plants can be managed to produce the amount of electricity required at anytime rather than be subjected to the whims of weather. These factors make pebble bed nuclear reactors much more desirable than wind and solar electric generation.,Sino,czz0tj0,4,t5_38jyn

This has nothing to do with me being here or not Im not a JV I dont work for a JV.ampnbspLiangs responseThere you go again equating China being independent and selfreliant with isolationism.  China being technologically and economically selfreliant and selfsufficient is not equivalent to isolating China by building a wall all around itself and terminating all contact with the rest of the world.  Nor will China become backward and poor even if it did build a wall around itself.  Remember the Great Wall of China?  Did China become backward and impoverished for thousands of years?  Obviously not.  China was the most advanced and richest country in the world for the duration of the Great Wall.  It is only after the West invaded China and China was unable to keep it out that China had become backward and poor.  And now the only way for China to become advanced and rich again is for it to be selfreliant and selfsufficient.  The West will deny this truth.  But it was the goal of the West to force itself on the rest of the world for the last several hundred years so that it can plunder the rest of the world including China.  So obviously the West will say whatever to trick China to open itself.And incidentally Qing China was not isolated in any way.  Qing China had exported millions of ounces of silver every year ever since the West penetrated into China.  It is the excessiveness of exports that had collapsed Qing China and not isolation.  Ive already explained the insidious destructiveness of joint venture.  I will only say again that the loss of Chinas own domestic car market is what will inevitably happen with all joint ventures with foreigners.  And once again no advanced technologies were ever transferred freely to the Chinese.  The US had banned even the export of socalled dual use high tech products to China.  The US has even banned the export of CPU processor chips to China.And also it is the US who is now building the wall to isolate itself.  Ever heard of Trumps fabled wall?,Sino,d4iodrp,1,t5_38jyn
8053053,0,t3_4pioyi,Ancient Documents Reveal Sunspots Auroras and Other Solar Activity before GalileoSome references to the phenomena date as early as the seventh centuryBy Rachel Nuwer on July  gt A premodern drawing of what may be an aurora in the Chinese manuscript Tianyun Yl Xingyf. Credit COURTESY OF NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF JAPAN gt Until Galileo kickstarted modern astronomy in the early s the record of the suns activities was basically blankor so scientists thought. To shed light on our stars history researchers at Kyoto University in Japan have begun to comb through ancient texts. So far they have found dozens of apparent references to sunspots auroras and other solar events that date as far back as the seventh centuryalbeit in terms that require more interpretation than Galileos drawings.gt Although scientists can use ice cores tree rings and sediments for clues as to past weather and climate change things like space weather and auroras leave little or no trace says Bruce Tsurutani a space plasma physicist at NASA who is not involved in the Kyoto research. So we need information that man has taken himself.gt To that end a team of historians and astronomers in Kyoto analyzed hundreds of handwritten Tang Dynasty documents from China as well as Japanese and European manuscripts from around the same period the seventh to th centuries. As reported online in April in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan the researchers came across the terms white rainbows and unusual rainbows again and again. In fact such spectacles were written about on the same dates in the documents from all three regions. Because people in such geographically distant locations simultaneously reported the phenomenon the descriptions can only be explained as auroras says lead author Hisashi Hayakawa who is a student at Kyoto Universitys Graduate School of Letters. Auroras are caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with particles in Earths atmosphere. They usually occur as rings around our planets magnetic poles.gt Last year the group also published a comprehensive list of what most likely are sunspots mentioned in the official history of Chinas Song Dynasty th to th centuries where the spots are described as plums peaches or eggs in the sun. Overall they have recorded  sunspots  unusual or white rainbows and  other auroralike events which are compiled into a searchable open database online.gt There is no way to know for sure whether the texts refer to the work of our solar systems star says Hiroaki Isobe an astronomer and one of the papers authors. The interpretation of antiquated language usages is a unique challenge in this endeavor as is deducing the true nature of events that ancient authors often interpreted as omens. Descriptions of tsunamis and earthquakes are clear but for historians its quite difficult to know what a description like the sky was red means Hayakawa says. The Kyoto team hopes to gather more evidence that its conclusions are correct by collaborating with researchers in Europe Saudi Arabia and South Korea who are also conducting historical studies of solar events.gt A longterm record of the suns activities could ultimately reveal patterns that for example tell scientists more about the shifting of Earths magnetic poles and the effect if any the suns magnetic activity has on our planets climate. Such a record could also provide a better understanding of solar flares which can fry satellites cause electrical blackouts and disrupt telecommunications. In predicting the future we have to know the past Isobe says.gt ,Sino,d4l8m1l,1,t5_38jyn

By contrast the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs ofcially protested the French annexation and prepared its own claim to Spratly Island based on its possession of Taiwan.gt Some authors have argued that the Japanese did not attack Vietnam until late  therefore their earlier occupation of the Spratly and Paracel islands must be viewed as movements against what they recognised as Chinese territory.gt Within the Japanese administrative system the Spratlys depended on Taiwan and the Paracels on Hainan.gt After Japan surrendered in  the Republic of China took over the Paracels and Shinnan from Japan and stationed troops on Itu Abu island which is the only island to produce fresh water in the Spratlys.gt After the Japanese defeat in the Pacific War those forces had planted Nationalist Chinese flags and stone markers on Itu Aba Spratly Island and West York Island and set up a garrison on Itu Aba in December  mainly to forestall apparent French attempts to return to the area. Moreover the Allies had designated Nationalist Chinese as recipients of the surrender of the Japanese forces in the area north of  North latitude.gt At the end of the Second World War AsianPacific Region Japanese forces withdrew from the Paracel and Spratly Islands on August  . Chinese fishermen resumed fishing and other commercial activities in the Paracels and Spratlys. In October and November  the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China formally retook the Paracels Spratlys and other islands in the South China Sea once again confirmed the division of Chinas islands in the South China Sea into the Dongsha Zhongsha Islands including Huangyuan Island Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands and reiterated Chinas territorial sovereignty over these islands.gt Chinese forces accepted the surrender of Japanese troops in northern Vietnam and were instructed to do so in the South China Sea islands.gt Two Chinese naval patrols were ordered to the Spratly islands in .

8636293,0,t1_d6kwqt9,My understand of quantum is limited and I only have more recently learned of quantum satelites but the focus here is to show entanglement can work over greater distances. Entanglement works by taking two or more particles and putting them into a superposition. What this means is measurement of one particle reveals information from the other. All of quantums intresting effects go back to superposition if I am not mistaken.The biggest question for me is this is an experiment so the results need to be validated somehow. To do this I believe a traditional signal is beamed to the satelite which in turn is used to change the state of an entangled photo. Then a measurement is made against the photon which was transmitted to earth. Another big question is how long can the superpositions be held. They decay over time so I believe this is also bring tested.Another fun question is why isnt America also doing these kinds of experience. One article mentions simular reseach in the UK but traditionally the US wants the edge of cryptography. So either they are doing this research but arent sharing or they think the value isnt there yet going back to the decay of superposition or the timely process of manipulating the entangled photons.EDIT I was wrong on all quantums intresting effects going back to superposition. Everything in quanntum computing seems to relate with superposition.

9062115,0,t3_54ecb4,Chinas Artificial Islands Are Bigger And a Bigger Deal Than You ThinkThomas ShugartSeptember  Figure  Range arcs depicting potential coverage of HQ SAMs YJ ASCMs and DF ballistic missiles from Chinas larger South China Sea island bases. Surely you have heard the news  China has been dredging up coral reefs and creating artificial islands in the South China Sea with the purpose of enforcing their claims to indisputable sovereignty of their Nine Dash Line and has defiantly continued to do so in the face of legal condemnation by the Hagues Permanent Court of Arbitration.  While the reactions of the United States and other nations to Chinas islandbuilding campaign have been vocal some U.S. analysts and experts have been largely dismissive of the new islands potential effects on the regional balance of power.  A recent RAND study statedThese facilities could host a handful of SAMs and fighter aircraftbut they are unlikely to be a significant factor in highintensity military operations against U.S. forces beyond the first hours of a conflict.Another analyst declared as a myth the possibility of that these new bases could alter the balance of power stating that In the age of precision strike any and almost all fixed targets can be destroyed with ease.  But the potential combination of Chinas premier antiship and antiair capabilities  along with the sheer breathtaking scale of Chinas islandbuilding  call for serious consideration of the faux islands potential impact to U.S. diplomacy and contingency planning as well as the need to take all possible measures to prevent their full militarization.Going Big in the Spratly Islands Chinas New Airfields Point Major Commitment of ForcesWhile the Chinese government has consistently claimed that its land reclamation projects are intended for nonmilitary purposes and Chinese President Xi has pledged that China does not intend to militarize them recent imagery shows largescale construction of airfields and base facilities.  The most significant basebuilding has been concentrated at what I term the big three Fiery Cross Subi and Mischief Reef. All three of these new islands will have approximately  foot runways deep water harbors and enough reinforced hangars to house  fighters as well as bombers tankers and airborne early warning aircraft.  Just as significant are the other airfield support facilities China appears to be constructing.  As an example a rough comparison of the size of Fiery Crosss airfield areas with those of a mainland Chinese fighter base Suixi Air Base see Figure  shows that this facility is probably being constructed to support a unit the size of a Chinese fighter regiment of note China is in the process of converting their air units to multiaircrafttype brigades but this analysis of scale should hold for now.  One can see on all three major islands the presence of meter running tracks along with tennis and basketball courts as well as block after block of what will likely be barracks headquarters workshops and warehouses. China is even openly discussing plans to construct mobile nuclear power plants to provide electrical power to the islands. With more than  hangars under construction on each of the big three bases this would allow all of a typical Chinese regiments fighters to be maintained indoors on each island. These do not seem intended as small airfields for occasional visiting aircraft. They look like major fighter bases in the making.One might think that China surely does not plan to base aircraft on these islands with the intent of using them to counter a U.S. intervention. After all a squadron of Sus flying out of Fiery Cross Reef base would most likely be smoking wrecks within hours of the start of any South China Sea conflict.  But if that is not the intent then why build three?  Even before building the islands China could easily have overwhelmed its regional competitors with naval surface action groups an aircraft carrier and landbased aircraft.  If China had built just one island base with dozens of aircraft it would have enjoyed an even greater overmatch against local rivals.  But instead China built three islands each with facilities that appear large enough to host a fighter regiment or brigade and support aircraft.  To put that in perspective three such air regiments on the three islands would add up to a fighter division a formation consisting of about  personnel and a commitment indicating that China perhaps has a larger foe in mind.Shields Up A Deployment of Chinas AAD systems Could Happen Overnight.If China is building the big three to be able to deter or counter a U.S. regional intervention its plans would likely include deployment of the counterintervention Chinas term antiaccessareadenial AAD systemofsystems that has already raised much concern in the United States.  Given recent deployments to Woody Island Chinas outpost in the Paracel Islands of HQ surfacetoair missiles SAMs see Figure  YJ antiship cruise missiles ASCMs and J fighters one could expect such deployments to the big three as well perhaps joined by the precisionstrike ballistic surfacetosurface SSM and landattack cruise missiles LACMs of the PLA Rocket Forces known formerly as the nd Artillery Corps.  A look at the resulting effective range arcs see Figure  shows that in a stroke China would have an interlocking and mutuallysupporting SAM umbrella over most of the Spratlys as well as ASCM coverage over the heart of the South China Sea.  Also where the U.S. military could previously have been able to operate out of austere southern Philippines airfields beyond conventional ballistic or groundlaunched cruise missile range China would now be able to strike with either DFC landattack ballistic missiles or CJ cruise missiles U.S. and allied facilities and airfields throughout the Philippines and even to Singapore.Areas of the Sulu and Celebes seas that would have been sanctuaries for U.S. aircraft carriers beyond the range of DFD antiship ballistic missiles ASBMs could now be within range of ASBMs launched from the island bases.  This development would further challenge the ability of U.S. aircraft carriers and their embarked air wings to operate at unrefueled striking range about  nautical miles with reasonable levels of risk in a Spratlys campaign.The picture would become even worse were China to build and militarize a similar island base at Scarborough Shoal which China seized from the Philippines in  and which has seen increased activity of late.  Chinas AAD coverage would then encompass almost the entirety of the claimed area of the Nine Dash Line.As a final note since all of the premier Chinese AAD are roadmobile a major deployment of them could happen almost overnight  all of the big three islands have deep water harbors that appear able to accommodate large rollonrolloff transports a single one of which could likely transport the necessary personnel trucks and transporters.,Sino,d814c3g,1,t5_38jyn

Since it stems from philosophy it encompasses a code of ethics and common laws the world practices today.gt gt Why people gravitate towards religion is because its easy to learn and it promotes a common good in society. Philosophy and academics is much harder to grasp for the average person because it requires more than just faith alone it requires a rational and logical thought process to deduce how the natural world works.gt gt I wish the CPC would make Buddhism the primary religion of the country. Doing so would greatly build bridges with Tibetans and help nation build. Modern day China is a young country and they need to better understand their identity.ampnbspLiangs responseObviously ancient peoples tried to explain the mysteries of the world by spinning a body of fairy tales.  It is also true that many religions form the basis for morality and social behavior.  But precisely because religions are false all the morality and social behavior that flow from religions are fruits of the poisoned tree and do more harm than good to the human race.  It is often observed that religions caused more wars and devastations than anything else.  And morality based on religions ultimately are arbitrary and irrational and unjust.  Therefore religions cannot be allowed to be the basis for morality and ethnics.Obviously people gravitate toward religions because they dont require any deep learning to believe in the fundamental tenets of various religions.  But at the same time major religions also pretend to be deep in the mechanics of the fantasied world.  There are literally millions of books on explaining or presenting the many religions.  And there are also innumerable books that codify countless religious laws.  No ordinary people can even begin to know all these religious rationalizations and religious laws.  This is why there are so many different sects that constantly war against each other.  In the end they are all nonsense and do great harm.To say that the CPC should make Buddhism Chinas primary religion is shear nonsense.  Ive already said that the CPC should eradicate all religions.  And it is shear folly to make Buddhism Chinas primary religion only to pacify a few Tibetans.  Furthermore if the CPC banned all religions most Tibetans will simply forsake Buddhism anyway.  Who wants to not eat meat and not have normal family life just to be monks?  Few if any.  As I said as Chinas economy continues to expand and grow all Chinese including the Tibetans will abandon religions and earn high incomes and enjoy the secular life.  And the fundamental laws of physics of the observable universe are not really all that difficult to understand.  They are certainly much easier to accept than the baseless fairy tales of religions.  And laws and social strictures that flow from the physical truths can be rationally debated and accepted by the people.  Such laws and social codes are much more conducive to a harmonious society and peaceful world.,Sino,dbnr6lf,1,t5_38jyn

10215988,0,t3_5maelm,Beijings space program soars in by Staff WritersMoscow Sputnik Jan   In  the Chinese government launched a whole array of major spacerelated projects which proved to be successful Russian military expert Vasily Kashin told Sputnik China.In  China started tests of its first heavylift Long March rocket. The successful completion of the launch vehicle will pave the way for the construction of a Chinese space station Kashin told Sputnik China. He also cited tests of the countrys solidpropellant rockets.Earlier this year China was the first to launch a quantum communication satellite into orbit as well as a satellite for conducting EmDrive engine tests according to Kashin.  also saw a manned mission on board the Chinese orbital module Tiangong where a cold atom interferometer was installed for possible scientific purposes including those related to detecting submarines.This year China ranked second after Russia in terms of its number of successful space launches while the number of Chinese satellites in orbit outstripped Russia in . Since then it has been strengthening its positon Kashin said.In  it was confirmed that China had created its first experimental missile early warning satellite according to him.These satellites are equipped with sensitive infrared sensors to register the missile launches. Presumably the satellite was launched in late  Kashin said. He also cited Chinas efforts to put new types of reconnaissance satellites into orbit and test new antisatellite weapons and the regular testing of such systems. According to the US statements are expected in the near future.So its safe to say that  proved to be a successful year for the Chinese space industry which will be developed further in  Kashin pointed out.Next year may see the launch of a lunar mission of the Chinese automatic station Change and the first automatic cargo ship Tianzhou as well as the continuation of construction of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System and the expansion of the network of Chinese reconnaissance satellites he said.The Chinese space program gradually comes to the fore in the world. Chinas shift to new generations of rockets will help reduce the use of a toxic rocket fuel called heptyl. It should be noted in this context that the second stage of the Long March rocket uses an innovative and environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel Kashin said.In order to be considered a superpower its necessary for China to develop an innovative economy and the growing military and political rivalry with the United States will add to the rapid development of Chinas space program even in the face of stalled economic growth he said.Russia for its part should expand bilateral space cooperation with China in order to give an additional impetus to its own space industry. In this vein Moscow should benefit from the production technology of powerful engines for liquidpropellant missiles and vast experience in the design of various space vehicles Kashin concluded.More Space developments ,Sino,dc21g4a,1,t5_38jyn

10980588,0,t3_5wsfj0,Chinas FC Fighter May Be Slated for Carrier Opsby Chen ChuanrenFebruary    AMFollowing the first flight of a second Shenyang FC prototype on December  last year there are now discussions within the Chinese media that the improved aircraft might be slated for operations on the new Chinese carrier fleet. The aircraft has been named the Gryfalcon.The second prototype is similarly configured to the model that was displayed at Chinas Zhuhai Airshow last November. It features some common design elements to the Chengdu J stealth fighter such as cropped vertical stabilizers. It also has an Electro Optic Targeting Sight EOTS under the nose. In an interview on Chinese television military analyst Chen Hu said that it is not surprising to see elements of the J on the FC since both jets are being developed by the stateowned Aviation Industry Corporation of China AIVC.A new scale model of the FC on display in the Shenyang Aviation Museum carries Chinese naval insignia further hinting at a planned carrier capability for the aircraft. The museum is owned by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation. Like most carrierborne aircraft the FC has a twin nose gear and it was recently reported that the third Chinese aircraft carrier would be fitted with three steam catapults.Chen also noted that the smaller and lighter footprint of the FC gives it an advantage on a carriers limited deck space. Moreover Shenyang would have an advantage over other Chinese aerospace companies because of its experience in adapting the Su for Chinese naval use as the J.Specifications revealed at the Zhuhai Airshow suggest that the length of the Gryfalcon has increased from . meters to . meters. The maximum takeoff weight has increased by three tonnes to  tonnes. In addition the wheel wells of the second prototype are significantly smaller allowing for a larger internal weapons bay capable of accommodating up to  tonnes of armaments.The aircraft was originally powered by the Russiansupplied Klimov R turbofans but Chinese analysts have noted that the latest test flight did not produce the thick exhaust smoke seen in earlier flights. This suggests that the second FC has new powerplants.The FC is selffunded by Shenyang which is hoping to export it. The current list price for the Chinese is at  million significantly lower than the FA Lightning II. In  Pakistans defense production minister Rana Tanveer Hussain stated his countrys interest in procuring  FC. Discussions have since reportedly advanced beyond the initial phase.More Military news ,Sino,decm5l3,1,t5_38jyn

11214292,0,t3_6037up,China to attend TPP negotiations in Chile this weekBy Chen Weihua | Updated  No one could have foreseen this just a little more than four months ago The next meeting for the TransPacific Partnership TPP will be held in Chiles capital Santiago after the withdrawal of the United States and with the participation of China.Representatives from  countries that formed the TPP plus China and South Korea will meet March  for the first time since US President Donald Trump announced his countrys exit from the group according to Reuters.Asked on Friday whether China plans to attend the meeting Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Chinese side supports economic integration in the AsiaPacific and stands ready to enhance communication and coordination with Chile and other relevant countries to build FTAAP Free Trade Area of the AsiaPacific create an open AsiaPacific economy and inject new impetus to economic growth in the region and beyond.We hope that the meeting will help realize the goals. To my knowledge the Chinese side is actively considering attendance at the meeting Geng told the daily briefing in Beijing.The  economies signing the TPP in February last year included the US Australia Brunei Canada Chile Japan Malaysia Mexico New Zealand Peru Singapore and Vietnam.To most nations the withdrawal of the US the largest economy in the group literally killed the TPP. However many still have not given up. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe travelled to the US twice to meet Trump after his election win and after his inauguration in a bid to persuade Trump. Japan is the only economy which has ratified the TPP.Even within the US many trade experts and former officials especially those who had worked hard in the Barack Obama administration to push for the TPP have also tried to lobby the Trump administration to change its mind.Just last Tuesday the Asia Society Policy Institute issued a report on trade and economic integration in the AsiaPacific urging the US government to reconsider its position on TPP even with possible adjustments.However Trump and his Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have repeatedly expressed their views that bilateral trade agreements instead of multilateral agreements would serve the US better economically.The TPP has been criticized by some in the US for being oversold as a geopolitical tool against China the largest trading partner for many countries in the AsiaPacific including the  TPP members.Former President Obama had said on various occasions that the US not China should write the rules of the global economy.That kind of rhetoric has deepened suspicions among many Chinese that the Obama administration was weaponizing TPP as a part of its rebalance to Asia strategy to curtail the rise of China.The views of the Chinese government however have evolved over time from initially regarding the TPP as a US containment strategy to expressing an interest to understand more of the USled agreement.China has been working with  other AsiaPacific economies to advance the negotiations of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership RCEP between the  ASEAN countries China India Japan South Korea Australia and New Zealand.Just a week ago the  RCEP economies concluded its fiveday th round of negotiations in Kobe Japan. They will meet again in the Philippines in May and India in July for the next two rounds of talks.While the original plan to conclude the RCEP by the end of year still looks uncertain the RCEP has been regarded as a viable way for regional economic integration after Trump sounded the death knell of TPP on Jan .Trump was not the only one opposing TPP. Three other top contenders in the  US presidential election  Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz  all opposed TPP.Many US economists and trade experts believe that the strong antiTPP sentiment among Americans has been largely due to the poor job the US government has done in helping vulnerable groups negatively affected by past free trade agreements.During the APEC leaders summit in Beijing in Nov  both TPP and RCEP were envisioned as possible pathways to an FTAAP.While Chinas participation in the TPP meeting in Chile this week is set to make major headlines no one seems sure about the fate of TPP after the US withdrawal or whether and when China might join the TPP negotiations.One thing that seems sure is that China has increasingly expressed its support for globalization and open trade while the Trump administration increasingly smacks of protectionism and isolationism.More International news ,Sino,df34km6,2,t5_38jyn

Lets be real here the if we had the social economic of the chinese youre find that their doing quite well compare to the other asian immigrantsAs for the  report its hardly reflect the current situation now because after the  it was end of massive chinese immigration most of them are still trying to settle which is why you see them lower then whites. I doubt that white people are doing as good as they were now compare to the sPersonally I think the chinese americans will surf out this just fine as long they remain what they are doing now.

11581349,0,t3_65aiwl,New Chinabacked leader of Hong Kong says no room for independenceApr   | pm BSTHong Kong leaderelect Carrie Lam said on Tuesday there is no room for moves towards independence in the former British colony which she said needs the support of the central government in Beijing to boost economic development over the next five years.Leaders in Beijing have been increasingly concerned about a fledgling independence movement in the financial hub that returned to mainland rule in  with a promise of autonomy.Hong Kong has seen tumultuous times over the past couple of years with prodemocracy protests quelled an increase in what many residents see as creeping interference by Beijing and the rise of a small but vocal movement pushing for independence.On the issue of Hong Kong independence in line with what the premier has said there is no future and no room Lam told reporters in Beijing after Premier Li Keqiang presented her with a letter of appointment as chief executive paving the way for her to take office on July .In the next five years in particular in economic development there are many areas in which we need support from the central government added Lam who also met President Xi Jinping.The Chinesecontrolled citys former chief secretary was chosen in March to become its first female leader by a person election committee stacked with proBeijing and proestablishment loyalists.Lam has said unifying society and healing political divisions would be among her most urgent tasks. Making housing more affordable in one of the worlds most expensive property markets is also among her top priorities. Huge prodemocracy protests in late  brought parts of the city to a standstill and hindered policymaking and legislative work.The promotion of independence has long been taboo in Hong Kong amid fears in Beijing the notion could spread to activists in other places and become a challenge to central government rule.The next few months will be critical for incumbent leader Leung Chunying and Lam with Xi expected to visit on July  to celebrate the th anniversary of Hong Kongs handover from British to Chinese rule with protests expected.More Domestic news ,Sino,dg8r3vj,1,t5_38jyn

If an Asianowned business operated in an environment that is poorer than a Whiteowned business then the lower wages is a result of the socioeconomic environment. In other words any business that operated in that environment will offer lower wages. The fact that the owners are Asian makes no difference. A Whiteowned business will do the same thing. gtIf you talk about Mom and Pop businesses that cater to Asian community then majority of the time these owners operates on a tighter budget as compared to their White counter part.Again if the geographic area has low wages in general then it is unfair for Asian businesses to pay more simply because they are hiring Asians.
