8841608,0,t3_51aiyl,Im thinking about ditching my cash ISA for an index tracker. Ive seen hampl had quite a few options including vanguard life strategy  which Ive seen mentioned many many times and wanted to move my cash ISA to it. It has a . management fee. I have several questions  what does it track? is it US centric? Or UK? Do I just pay a yearly fee that is taken out of my money directly? there are other trackers UK centric that are cheaper and hampl seems to value them more since they are in their wealth  page. Any idea why? Thank you very much!,FIREUK,d7amwf2,4,t5_39jiw

During retirement you can keep on drawing salary and dividends from the company. Not simple but could be worth looking at.,FIREUK,d9retk2,1,t5_39jiw
9593433,0,t1_d9ux63f,Well not all of your savings will be cash ie loan repayments are not so personally I would save  of the cash. Most people advocate an emergency fund but personally Ill take my chances without one and if I need to Ill just withdraw from my ISA if I need some money  its readily accessible anyway. So to answer your question  of the cash you save I would invest personally. ,FIREUK,d9vl5bd,1,t5_39jiw

9902929,0,t1_dalz4c1,Which variables am I discounting? Where does your income have any effect on your FIRE date? You dont have to live in a  bed semi own a new car or a  TV and a PlayStation. If you DO want to thats fine more power to you. Yes if you earn minimum wage you are already living frugally out of necessarily but there is nothing stopping you from living MORE frugally. k is already the top  of earners when you consider it globally.As I said your income has nothing to do with your saving rate which is the ONLY variable needed to determine your FIRE date.,FIREUK,daydhz2,1,t5_39jiw
