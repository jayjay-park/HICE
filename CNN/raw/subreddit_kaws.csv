He doesnt have to pay for new molds they sell out instantly and it helps combats bootlegs due to the lower price point.  Its time for him to finally cash in rather than keep things limited I guess.,kaws,demxwoj,1,t5_3345p
11083766,0,t1_deo9yw9,Thats kind of how much they are selling for on the aftermarket to be honest.  This is their actual price in store?  Seems a little surprising since their prices are usually quite fair.  Personally if I were you I would wait there will likely be more hitting the market again if youre patient.  ,kaws,deoc2n2,1,t5_3345p
