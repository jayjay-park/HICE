10415677,0,t3_5okduc,I tried to do the Infinite Summer read  got about  of the way through it but then got too far behind and gave up. Hope to actually make it this time. Im reading it on my kindle. Read a few DFW essays but thats it!,InfiniteDiscussion,dcooo6a,2,t5_3ileo
10562612,0,t3_5qy8n7,TBH I dont think the format for the discussion on this sub is that good. Id much rather be able to talk with other people while I read the book about specifics that I just read ie I just read this and didnt really get how it connected to the rest of the story what did you all think? but the discussion thread for the week going up after the week is over makes that hard. It would be much better if we had a collection of all the  threads made now and we could go in and have a discussion over the pages within them there.  Also all the quotes thread being populated by people who already read the book before this readalong started is really dumb. This is not an Infinite Jest subreddit this is an Infinite Jest readalong subreddit. ,InfiniteDiscussion,dd5e3pz,5,t5_3ileo
