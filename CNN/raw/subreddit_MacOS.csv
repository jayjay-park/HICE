10787619,0,t3_5uan2v,Click on Disk Utility from the menu or if this is a USB installer select Utilities from the menu bar and click Disk Utility.Then just select the startup volume  its probably greyed out  and erase it again GUID Partition Table and Mac OS Extended Journaled. No big deal since theres no data on it. Disk Utility tends to be a pain when you erase the entire disk rather than the partition aka erasing the APPLE HDD rather than the Macintosh HD volume that appears under it  makes you do it twice. In the future you really only need to just erase Macintosh HD,MacOS,ddsnykv,1,t5_2s2gv
