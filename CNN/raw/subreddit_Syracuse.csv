I am  born and raised right here in Eastwood. Like you said a college kid. However I do not attend SU but some of my friends do so I probably go to SU campus a little more than the average Syracuse resident. When I was a little younger most of my time was spent skateboarding around downtown and now as Ive grown a little older I find myself still going there. The city feel inspires me and the reason for the name My Syracuse is because the video represents both mine and the other filmmakers perspectives. My home My city My story.

3262601,0,t3_2xgooi,Depending on what youre used to paying for rent now Syracuse can seem too good to be true rent wise. Apartments downtown are the most expensive in the city but still cheap in comparison to other cities. I have several friends who love living downtown. Theres a huge housing boom going on there right now. However with a lot of those downtown apartments youll also have to pay for a parking space. Many neighborhoods are within a few minutes drive to downtown with cheaper rent and better parking situations.I live in Tipp Hill and can be downtown in  minutes. When the weather is nice I plan on biking downtown to work. A majority of the city isnt incredibly bike friendly yet but we manage all the same. Every neighborhood has a small local park Tipp hills is larger because it includes a golf course and a zoo. If you like the bar scene there are a lot of them here its an Irish neighborhood. But downtown and Westcott st also have some great places.Other neighborhoods include Park ave close to Leavenworth park as possible Strathmore UniversityWestcott be careful of bum university landlords though HawleyGreen Sedgwick Eastwood.. You can be downtown in about  minutes or less from any of them.Within a  hours drive you can hit up places like Ithaca Rochester the Finger Lakes Adirondacks etc.. Even a quick weekend trip to parts of Canada Philly or NYC are more than doable!Edit also you may be used to winters but then theres Syracuse winters..

3644269,0,t3_3214w9,I grew up here moved around and then came back. Why? Because Syracuse is an affordable cityregion with lots to offer. Within a two hour or so drive you can find a huge list of things to do. Do you love winter? I dont but great! Skiing snow shoeing snowmobiling   we have it all. Love the outdoors in the summer? Great! We have the Adirondacks not too far away and lots of trail walking tucked away in every corner of the region. There are so many state and county parks in this area you could spend the entire summer trying to visit them all. There are amusement parks big and small Thunder Island in Fulton Seabreeze in Rochester Darien Lake near Buffalo. Love wine? Well you honestly couldnt get much better than the Finger Lakes region. Not only that but the Finger Lakes are simply gorgeous. We are close to Lake Ontario and we have lots of little lakes and rivers for boating one of my favorite summer activities. You mention specifically quirky small town and healthy options. Have you been to Ithaca? You can find a lot of activities and quirky small townhealthy options there. Armory Square also has a lot of little shops and restaurantsbars that are often small local businesses. ,Syracuse,cq7o979,3,t5_2qn4e

Pearls are not in style. They are not in demand. If you find a buyer directly you could make some money. If you enlist the services of a middle man i.e. a pawn or jewelry shop be prepared for disappointment. These places MIGHT buy if youre lucky and they see your string as desirable. But they will only get involved if the price is super low. This will compensate for how long it will take to find a buyer and for how saturated the pearl market is.They arent rare. Thousands and millions of people are inhereting strings of pearls from people that owned them at a time when they were valuable and in style.Thats the best info you can get.Bersani wont touch them and neither will any major chains like Zales or Kay.,Syracuse,cvcbyro,1,t5_2qn4e
