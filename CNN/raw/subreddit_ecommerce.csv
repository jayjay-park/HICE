Wix used to only be templates but I see they have online shop templates that seem to have checkout abilities.Those are meant for you to create you own without programming knowledge. Then there are also software packages that you or a professional you hire can install and configure on your own hosting for example rJoomla rWordpress rMagento rDrupal which give you more control over everything but require more skill and usually a professional to really work well.,ecommerce,cglddn6,2,t5_2qhin

817240,0,t1_cgx493b,Ok think about it this way. How long are you willing to wait till you break even.For example if a site does  in profit every month and the seller asks for k that means it will be a year before you break even on the investment.Of course as a buyer Ill hope to increase profits every month. So Ill be thinking if I cut down on ad campaigns put in more effort into SEO content marketing and social media I might be able to make back the investment in  months instead of .Now if the site is making a loss it will take you a lot longer to make back your investment because you first have to start making profits. Not only are you paying money for the site youre also losing more money on the first few months because it isnt profitable yet.Can you identify areas where you can cut costs and increase revenues? If so make a chart of the profit and loss for every month of the next year or so taking into account your assumptions of how youll make the store profitable and how much you think you can grow those profits. Then find out how long it will take to make back the money you spend buying the site. If youre not comfortable with that negotiate to a lower price.,ecommerce,cgx68pj,1,t5_2qhin

1078649,0,t3_25s7cq,Just took a look at your site. Here is my advice.. Jewellery is pricey. You should put confidencebuilding things along your site. Example Safe Shipping with tracking? Returns?. Also I would show pictures of the warehouse and the staff so visitors see there are people behind the site. Any certificate that proofs their value would be nice.. I would change the color of the button Add to cart to any that stands out more. . If you have a large stock I dont think Shopify is a good choice no sorting weak subcategories. I would either narrow down your stock or go with a powerful CMS like Magento or Prestashop that can handle sorting and subcategories and also are free and doesnt charge a comission per unit sold. . People that look for a ring will probably have lots of doubts. Put a phone number in a large font at the top of the site.. Product description is essential If you have no timeresources to write a good description I would narrow down the stock and write descriptions for those few articles. .

Yes thats true but you can work a sale notification or featured product into your landing image.I dont like that the add to cart option only appears if you select a size. Its confusing  some people wont intuitively know to pick a size before adding it to the cart. You could try radio buttons instead of a drop down. Doing so will put the options front and center instead of hidden in a menu.Your add to cart CTA is considered week. Try a phrase like Buy Now or Buy Me. Those are just examples but they tend to work well. Youre commanding your customer to make a purchase not just meekly put it in their cart and move on.Build up your inventory.

On your homepage you say Builders of unique gadgetry cases. Thats an ok one. Personally I would focus more on your customer. They dont care that you are builders or makers. They want the unique cases for their gadgets.That USP text should be a lot bigger amp stand out on the homepage. It should also be repeated on every page so visitors that land for example on a product page immediately know what your store is about.Since youre selling a unique product youll have to educate your buyers as well. In your top navigation you make me choose between European Oak and Engineered pine. But I have no idea what the difference is. You could already add descriptions to the category pages of both types that explain what exactly the difference is between products.Beef up the craftsmanship of your products. Because you are making a stand against mass production you need to show how your products are different. How do you create the products? How do you select the materials? Video can be a great to tell this story.Social proof instead of focusing on lack of social proof try to address a couple of objections people might have. You mention running ads your goal will be to attract people in the market for a new case. What questions do they have? What do they base their decision on? For example will this unique case make it impossible for me to put it into my pants pockets?You can use your product pagereviews to address these issues.Some small remarks Add filters to the product amp category pages to make browsing easier Remove the Search box from the top Email signup form Why should people put in their email address?

Getting them printed yourself is also great because then you generally will make larger margins but you also have to do all the work of selling them yourself. Another problem with that is your cost on the shirts will be lower the more you print..meaning you want to do batch orders to keep the cost down.

You likely could do it with Wordpress amp WooCommerce though id personally pick a stronger platform.

5381815,0,t3_3nvmtp,Shopify is a great solution if you dont have a strong tech background and want to get eCommerce store setup quickly. They have integrated solutions for payment processing a solid framework and a HUGE community of app developers. Ive been really happy with Shopify as its allowed me to focus on growing my business amp improving our customers experiences rather than troubleshooting tech issues etc. I have multiple sites that I migrated from Magento to Shopify in the past two years. I did this so I could easily make changes to my website without needing to hire a Magento developer. Magento is extremely powerful but youll need a strong PHP background if you want to make changes on your own even small ones. Also I recommend that you purchase a Shopify theme as you can pick up something unique amp customizable for cheap  around . This is beneficial in a few ways.  Your site will have a more unique look as a bunch of stores use the free themes.  When you purchase a theme you will have access to the theme developers who can be very helpful in answering questions about customizing their theme adding unique pages etc.  I Hope this helps!,ecommerce,cvzl5x4,1,t5_2qhin
5439658,0,t3_3p6pkm,Great question. Ecommerce is not as lowrisk as many people think. An online store doesnt have a storefront so you have to drive traffic to the store which costs money. You then have to make sure you have things on your store that will optimize the conversions chat reviews blog etc which also cost money. Thats not to mention paying for the platform that runs the actual store. All that said however it can be a great revenue model if you fill a consumer need and if theres a real place for you in the online market. Just make sure youre using apps that you need like chat and that arent just nicetohave additions like an app that makes your receipts pretty. Thats how I do it. I think its still less expensive than paying rent and employees  you just have to be smart about what kind of marketing you allocate your dollars to. I use Shopify and have a couple of apps running on my store but thats it for tech. The rest goes to advertising and PR. ,ecommerce,cw6ywxe,1,t5_2qhin

Tomoson you put a promotion up and then let bloggers come to you.  Many of them do reviews for free products and place those reviews on Amazon.  However I invited the bloggers to my affiliate program and Tomoson promptly kicked me out.  There was nothing in TOS and I was pretty upset.  Basically they were mad that I offered an affiliate program when I wasnt really paying for the bloggers.  Which is dumb and they are only going to continue to run into that problem.

Then they would need to either remove it or go looking for a replacement item.This would happen when you have a limited stock for a given item specifically always when you are having a sales campaign. That would be a bad process poor customer satisfaction and possibly unnecessary customer support. What would be the gains of doing it that way? Maybe some sales campaign for the first xx to get it for a certain price? ,ecommerce,cx39gvv,1,t5_2qhin
5697705,0,t1_cx3a1ba,Thanks for the feedback.  The analogy at first makes sense except in the virtual store I can place every item in my cart.   iPads.  New release video game?  Ill take .  Now no one can buy them until my cart expires or I release them.  If the stock is limited on an item it is easily even accidentally exploitable.  If the stock is not limited or backorderable then you dont need to worry about stock in the cart anyway.  Lots of inventory dont need reservation.  Little inventory bad idea to reserve until purchased.  gt If you reserved them only at the checkout point you would allow the customers to collect all of the items they are going to buy only to notice on the checkout that they wont be able to buy it.A better experience would be to display a warning in the cart when an item is out of stock wouldnt it?  No need to take them all the way to checkout.  If we reserve for cart we are not solving the problem you explained.  You merely move it to the cart rather than checkout.  And you increase how often it happens as well since many users even bots can decriment stock in the cart only.  So from an experience point of view it is still debatable that reserving in cart is any better than reserve at first stage of checkout.  ,ecommerce,cx3csqk,2,t5_2qhin

My affiliate marketing is all free so any money I make while the fad lasts is money in the bank and as far as inventory I was ordering like k to k worth of boards every week or two Ive trimmed back on how much inventory Im keeping. Now Im getting more into repair and parts though continuing to supply some local stores with boards and do a little online stuff as well. Honestly even if hoverboards dry up at that point there is going to be a whole new generation of rideables with the same customer base be it one wheel skateboards electric unicycles one wheel motorcycles etc. Also any email list or customer list you build up can be used for drones video games or a number of other things the hover board crowd will be interested in.

Initially they had  different furniture type websites and later on decided to have everything under  website. One of the main reasons was that customers did not realise they had other websites so if they bought a bed and needed a mattress they would buy it from a different website instead of theirs.  website also helped them with repeat customers. Now their a multi billion dollar company.When starting out it is best to reduce costs so having  website will be cheaper in terms of maintenance seo PPC social media marketing conversion rate optimisation etcAs a side note take your time in choosing the right ecommerce platform as well otherwise it would cost you money and time if you change later,ecommerce,d0gvrx7,1,t5_2qhin

Act like you want to order a large quantity speak professionally as a  procurment or sourcing agent would and youll get prices.Why get prices for   of something you want  of? Well if youre entering a market and intend to sell head to head with equal pricing to competitors you will deter sales and theyll lower prices. But how far can you go? and them? Well this technique will help you. It boils down to formalities.

Still not cheap but I have seriously impressive photos compared to competitors.For logo design I went to Fivver. I got a handful of cheap shitty logos before turning the project over to a real graphic designer.  cash normally charges  always use cash if possible and the kid got the logo on the first set of  renderings. Didnt even have to revise or edit. Now I have a badass logo for the life of my products. I always offer continuing business to get price down as well.

Ive clicked around on some of your products and I see no words or product descriptions where you are compelling people to click the buy button. Also ran a site search on google and all your category pages are coming up as s  ouch.  redirect those categories where you changed the names. I can see potential in this site just get more traffic. Landing pages in the most traditional sense are stripped down single purpose pages without navigation or anything distracting that would lead the target away from starting a conversion funnel.

I learned a lesson from my military service and that is never rush to failure. My business strategies and plans all include time to get it up and running prior to going live. I prefer to have total control over my web apps which will help me scale later down the road. So therefore I take my time building my ventures. That being said I am in the Army so I have a very stable paycheck roof over my head and benefits for my family so I am in no rush with my side businesses.

10558065,0,t3_5r3jv7,Ive said this once and Ill say this a million more times. In order to get someone to buy something from you  it requires you to be different than a competitor in ways that make them want to purchase. Otherwise why wouldnt I go to the competitor if they have A B and C while you only have B or C as the things that make you special.That said  cheaper prices is very very rarely a differentiator! Trying to get people who dont want to spend much money for something they dont need is counter intuitive. Lower price as a differentiator works in a few cases when its paired with convenience when its on necessities or when its a revolutionary in that industry this has been done via logistics chains driving costs way down or advancements in technology but it must make something accessible to an entirely new economic tier.TLDR No one wants cheap products. Cheap  bad. Price isnt going to win you business.,ecommerce,dd4vjs8,2,t5_2qhin

The most prominent examples and traffic driven sources Ive seen for dropshipping stores based on Aliexpress products and the like are often far worse than mine the photos for the products will leave blatant watermarks inChinese writing the footer of the page will have the Shopify watermark the prices are seemingly at a very high markup they wont even have a dedicated domain i.e. thestorename.myshopify .com etc. If these other stores perpetuated by the multitudes of gurus on this subject who have made many hundreds of thousands are so streaked with bad design why are the minute bad details within my page preventing it from getting practically any sales?

11219260,0,t3_602pu5,Ok from what I noticed your store is way too busy. Its overloaded with apps that are reducing the performace of the store. Too many plugins  cut it down. I doubt you need those four icons at the bottom of the screen. To me it dosent make the store look legit but rather fake. The reviews tab at the side is unescessary. Why dont you implement the Shopify Reviews insteadYoure store itself dosent look great which can affect user conversion rates. Id suggest getting a better theme. Youre current one is fine but it could be better. The better the theme the better trust you provide with the customer. If your store takes too long to load it will scare users awway. If its cluttered with unescessary UI elements it will scare them away. Your store needs to be as clean as possible. A good example could be this   The theme is clean and the UI is not cluttered. I am making my own store myself I can provide you a link to see what I am doing. I would suggest for you to change the theme reduce the clutter and mabye change some of the titles? Including free shipping in every title seems a bit unescesary. Mabye in the description as it looks cleaner. ,ecommerce,df3otio,2,t5_2qhin

For example if I ordered for condoms once and they were discreetly delivered once to my doorstep for sure I would never buy condoms from a pharmacy again. The average single male low income earner in Kenya spends at least USD on cheap condoms a year while for high earners the value goes up drastically since they get laid more easily plus they spend money on high end brands.
