6846503,0,t3_47tarb,The claim is mostly true but it depends on your data. if you have shitty data there is no way the software will be able to pull the data needed. Any RTK system boasts gtcm accuracy. That said While RTK does save some time I personally will never trust it completely and will always have a surveyor set some ground controltargets for me.While you can be cm accurate in the horizontal its the vertical that can be a problem since the vertical is calculated via triangulation of the parallax in the images. I was never comfortable sending out a deliverable for engineering and design purposes relying souly on RTK as there are times where ive found the horizontal to be dead on but the vertical was off by  ,UAVmapping,d0scvxs,2,t5_38jg9

9584629,0,t1_d9tzyvk,Relative accuracy on things such as stockpiles will turn out really well compared to traditional survey work. Asbuilts of landfills and large quantities of dirt was well. The problem youll face is absolute accuracy youll need to use GCPS and those will need to be surveygrade to have a shot at being within acceptable accuracy tolerances compared to traditional survey methods.Weve found the same results on our stockpile asbuilts as well.,UAVmapping,d9ui1rf,1,t5_38jg9

10904016,0,t1_de4km8y,thanks for your reply.  Actually Im on the side of a mountain and the perimeter of the property has a ton of tall trees.  Just yesterday I got my P caught in a tree and had to fish it down.  I have a P w GoPro and was doing a test flight. My backyard has a steep slope and I want a D model to figure out the best way to handle my needs for bringing in additional fill dirt for the construction of a more usable yard. I could probably learn a lot on this process through trial and error if I had access to D software to build this model.  I just learned D catch is gone and I dont know where else to go.  Do you have other suggestions?  It would be very much appreciated!Any advice for my P vs Pv?  FYI I dont have FPV anymore long story and just bought the ground station link off ebay to use waypoints when taking photos.,UAVmapping,de4o6uq,1,t5_38jg9
11302132,0,t3_61ah46,Let me introduce you to the RiCopter....Its survey grade and will cost you just under There are other units that have the Velodyne pucks that work...but they arent survey grade...There is no such thing as a cheap LIDAR drone let a lone a cheap ready to fly LIDAR drone...Honestly if you wanted to map beach ridges and dont care for it to be insanely geo accurate...a Phantom  would work just fine you also would need to purchase the data processing software or rent it...I fly for material volumes at a local steel mill and we found out that a Phantom  pro was good enough accuracy wise...so thats all we use for flying volumes for mapping we use an sensefly eBee or an Albris...,UAVmapping,dfd2vzo,5,t5_38jg9
