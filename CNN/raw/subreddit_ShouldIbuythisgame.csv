6736,0,t1_cef4cex,If you want to you can but yeah its not that great. The gameplay is really reworked in II and beyond and its much better. You can probably guess most of the story of the first one from playing the others especially Revelations where you play as Altair for some bits.What I did was started at Brotherhood and love it instantly.

Trying to survive on your own can be a little difficult at first however once you run into some people who are great to play with the game really shines as you build up your base and defend it from other groups raiding parties. Its one of those games where the people who play it create the story in a way. Also I love the rush you feel when you are on a server with tons of people and witness a large supply drop knowing that you could make it to that gear but so can many others the race is on and its intense as all hell!,ShouldIbuythisgame,cehttcd,5,t5_2ud8h
32615,0,t3_1uhb83,Maybe not exactly what youre after but I recently picked up DMC Devil May Cry and I cant get enough of it. The fighting style is a really intense hacknslash sort of thing. All of your attacks look huge but arent slow or clunky. The amount of knock back feels just right a problem I had with games like Darksiders was that you could just beat the crap out of an enemy and they wouldnt be affected at all.

For me it was a solid game and its biggest crime was mostly that it was so much the same as its predecessors. The few small differences didnt do a lot for me and I hoped it would be a lot more Year Oneish than it was it seemed weird that Batman had equivalent gadgets to everything he has later on in the series when hes still pretty new at the whole hero thing. I didnt have any instances of the goons suddenly getting real good at fighting and I didnt think the Ranked upgrade stuff was a big deal because most of it wasnt particularly useful. All in all it was more of the same in a way that wasnt necessarily bad it just wasnt at all rewarding. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,cf2itnz,2,t5_2ud8h

352725,0,t3_1y2lm7,The best way to describe DayZ is one part zombie survival sim one part social experiment.Everyone is trying to survive in this hostile world which means that players will often kill other players just out of fear of losing their own gear.DayZ has no kind of base building mechanic yet so all you do is wander from town to town collecting food medicine equipment and ammunition until you eventually die.I have really enjoyed it but it is also heartbreaking when you are walking through a town and get sniped by some dude on a hill.But I agree that DayZ is definite the more hardcore of the two. So if you are looking for a blood sweat and tears survival experience go for DayZ.And of course the game is in Alpha so youll need some patience with bugs and whatnot but I believe it is well worth it. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,cfhbsjb,3,t5_2ud8h

388495,0,t3_1yj9j7,. Deus Ex HR. One of the best FPS games with RPG elements ever made. Amazing story and lots of ways how to play it.. Far Cry . Great sandbox FPS with many side quests. Story is a weak point here but gameplay is great.. Borderlands . More RPG elements than in other games more like a shooter version of diablo. Tons of loot and quests and great humor. Longest of all four if youre a completionist. Took  hours to complete all main quests and side quests on normal diff without even touhching any of the DLCs.. Metro . Didnt really like this one. Its a linear shooter so dont expect RPG elements. Game has good story and atmosphere and visuals are really good.

The levels are incredibly linear and neither of us could figure out how the cloaking works AI could move while cloaked but we couldnt but the gameplay was solid the controls worked well for a port and the levels were just genuinely fun.The game encourages stealth but wont punish you for going all out however you can die very quickly if you choose this path and there are parts where you are forced to go in all guns blazing. There is a small array of gadgets and loads of weapons and customizations to collect and play around with.The multiplayer seemed average as best.

406309,0,t3_1yq5zk,I suggest playing the first two. A great story with awesome gameplay. Makes you really think before you send your men out into the fight. Every character has a different feel and you become attached to them. Fire team members speak to eachother while in combat they yell out to you when you should do something. Such as We need to flank them! or Depending on which game you play it will either be Red or Baker get down! Gameplay wise Hells Highway takes the same Squad based combat system of finding fixing and flanking the enemy force with what you have. You will be put in many situations that feel like a puzzle. Charging head first only leads to a quick death. Unlike the past games Hells Highway feels easier from a veteran of the series view due to regenerating health and extremely accurate firing. What I mean by the latter is that in previous games just because your crosshairs or your ironsights are on the target doesnt mean it will be a  hit at many ranges. This teaches you to utilize your squad more than just setting them up then you go find a cozy spot and snipe. I finished Hells Highway on the hardest difficulty and rarely had any casualties. I remember playing Road to Hill  at the highest difficulty and getting buttfucked constantly. I am trying to say is that your allies  dont seem to die as often that or I was really good but I highly doubt this. I highly recommend playing the first two games before taking the step into Hells Highway. They are currently on sale on Steam.  for an amazing series that still touches me... in the good touch kind of way.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cfmvpd7,2,t5_2ud8h

584010,0,t3_20tdoa,I didnt even play Origins as I saw far too much bad press so this is just about City vs. Asylum. City was far better in my mind. Asylum was a blast the combat system was beautifully executed the story and voice acting were spot on and there were lots of little nods to the comic world. However the gameplay was extremely repetitive. Halfway through I got sick and tired of crawling through air ducts finding a room with goons wandering under gargoyles and swinging around taking them out one by one. The Scarecrow battle was awesome but why were there so many of them? Basically it got repetitive fast and the game lost a lot of the fun that the awesome stuff I mentioned brought into the picture. City on the other hand fixed that. They took you out of that stuffy asylum and gave you a whole swath of Gotham to run around in. You got experience Batman swooping and gliding and grappling freely. Building were small tastes of the claustrophobic stealth game that Asylum was and it was enough to break the open world up but not so much that it got stale. There was still great voice acting great story lots of collectibles and fan service and that awesome combat system plus the addition of Catwoman though that did get a little boring compared to the experience of playing as Bats. So yeah. Theres my two cents. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,cg6nmum,0,t5_2ud8h
585367,0,t3_20u6ni,If you are willing to wait look at Star Citizen there is a  package that gets you alpha beta and full release access and a starter ship. Its a piloting game though but it will have FPS action ship boarding and what not. Immersive? Thats one of than main pillars the game is being designed around. If you have heard of or played Freelancer or any of the Wing Commander series same guy that made those is making these. As for gameplay it ranges from being a merchant or explorer to being the captain of a military fleet and everything in between.

The feudal government system takes a bit of getting used to at first but once you do everything is pretty straightforward. The UI is simpler than EU theres less micromanaging I think I havent played very much EU and I previously saw someone describe it thus in CK the consequences stem pretty directly from your actions. You might not know off the bat that your child will adopt the culture of their guardian but it makes sense that they would and it clues you in to the fact that choice of guardian is important. In EU the consequences are much less obvious and seem to stem less directly from your actions.Thats my  cents but take it with a grain of salt because like I said I havent played very much EU.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cg98zza,12,t5_2ud8h

665512,0,t1_cgfqib9,gt  Mostly fading IMO due to Pandas and being able to pay for an advance to level .MoP had a much better increase in subs compared to cata. Pandas or not. It costs  for a level  boost thats a full game right there. The high price is actually a deterrent also. Blizzards idea for this was if you or your friends want to play WoW or get back into it you can boost yourself to play with your buds but they encourage leveling.Not to mention after both those things were added subscriptions increased so...gt Ive heard the dungeons are just a mess with inexperienced players sporing level  toons.The  feature just came out a few weeks ago the only thing that would be a mess is LFR but that was already crappy from the beginning due to assholes and most of the people that got the  boost are people that prepurchased the game who are experienced in it. Sure there are some new players that bought the boost without prepurchasing but they are most definitely in the minority.Regardless I agree with you on FFXIV its pretty fun WoW as well but I dont think Im going to even look at ESO I have a feeling its going to go FP sooner or later.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cgfx23a,2,t5_2ud8h
674934,0,t3_21vg1n,Its a great game and well worth playing for fans of DkS. To address your questions    gtThe first is that when you die your max health goes down untill it gets to  and the only way to fix it is to use an item of which there is a finite number of. Meaning if i died  tiems and there was only  of these objects i would be screwed for the rest of the game.    Humanity restoration objects are plentiful I never needed to use one in my first playthrough and had almost  by the end and there is a lategame area that will restore humanity for free if youre out of effigies. You can also regain humanity through coop like in DkS.    gt Another minor one would be the monsters not respawing after a time since that would make it hard to farm and lvl.  Despawning enemies are not as big a problem as you might imagine. Its annoying when you want to farm an item but you can use an item called Bonfire Ascetic to respawn all enemies in an area as harder NG versions. You probably wont want or need to farm mobs to level but there are a couple of areas with infinitely respawning enemies should the need arise.    gt if you have a habit of walking off of ledged and tiny planks a lot and i mean a lot.    Well...it happens. The new torch item helps a lot with this since you can light your way and see the floor better in underwater or dark areas.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cggznr6,1,t5_2ud8h

But I made sure to meet all my neighbors makes friends and keep things focused on external threats to our valley. It actually worked out really well.My favorite part was the social experiment aspect to it I ended up allied with the sort of people I would never play with normally I raided robbed and did sneaky as hell things all while maintaining a friendly and open persona on the server. Never outright murdering and helping out people where I could. When the server finally went belly up about  and a half month later I had  story metal tower crates full of guns more ammo then I could use and a stockpile of around  C hidden across my tower. And I was never once raided I always made sure it wasnt worth the C to would be enemies. And I played without a team and never shared resourceslived with anybody.

I would say that the combination of the vigors the powers in the game combined with the gear setups weapons and the skyline mechanics keep it out of bland shooter territoryand the story is pretty mindblowing.Anyway Im sure you can find it cheap somewhere for the PS version.

835071,0,t3_23ogar,My favorite coop games if not necessarily the best are Borderlands  and Rainbow Six Vegas .Rainbow  has a great terrorist hunt mode which pits a number of players against around  terrorists in a map. You can be tactful quiet and coordinated. Or you can go in guns blazing.Borderlands  is an incredible game easily my favorite of . In terms of a coop campaign I dont think there is a better game out there just in terms of sheer fun. Dont be persuaded to play BL instead though. While it was a lot of fun BL is in a different league. Play both if you can but if not DEFINITELY give BL a shot. Amazing writing one of the best villains in video gaming and lots of fun gameplay.Finally... if you like Skyrim and i can see the hate coming a mile away for this comparison... try Dark Souls Dark Souls . Very different styles of games in terms of gameplay but similar settings. Dark Souls is like a darker more mature and very demonic Zelda game. Great exploration lots of deep lore that only reveals itself if you dig deeply kind of like reading the books in SkyrimTES. Amazing online community. AND lots of people unfamiliar to the series are unaware that it has Coop and PvP elements. Probably one of my top  games of all time.

Dont go into the game expecting a similar experience to Chrono Trigger though  the connections between the two titles are very clever but they take a little bit of digging and detective work to completely understand.  It took me more than one playthrough to completely connect everything the story had to offer.CCs battle system is incredibly unique with the typical attack and magic choices so typical for JRPGs thrown right out the window.  Understanding how to best use this system takes time but is enjoyable.There is one thing about CC that makes it stick out from the pack for me  its flexibility in playstyle choices.  CC features  different playable characters and you have to do at least three playthroughs of the game in order to get them all.

936620,0,t3_24t1pz,Be advised DS is regionlocked completely. If youre looking to exclusively download games then it should be fine. You can buy games digitally from the systems original region with a corresponding credit card ex. North American credit card to buy North American versions of games.  Most of the big games come out physically and digitally on the same day and date. Just buy a big SD card GB is the max size without needing to do some light formatting trickery. The Vita has fewer problems. You can play any retail game but downloading games from multiple reasons can be a pain in the butt. It used to be that you could only have one PSN account per memory card which sucks because those suckers are expensive but I dont know if thats still true or not. Also I believe that you cant mix regions and payment options. As in you cant buy a game on Japanese PSN with a North American credit card or a game on North American PSN with a Japanese PSN gift card. You should be fine if you have a North AmericanEuropean credit card and account and just want to play those games digitally.As for the libraries Ill just start off with the JRPGs also a favourite of mine the Vita has the DS beat considerably... if you count all the PSP and PS games that you can download digitally. The PSP had a metric ton of JRPGs Trails in the Sky Tactics Ogre Ys Oath in Felghana ZHP Persona  Portable etc. and there are a good two dozen classic PS JRPGs on PSN Suikoden Chrono Cross Grandia nearly every Final Fantasy game before FFX etc.. Otherwise youre looking at a pretty spare library. Oddly enough the Vita has become a haven for indie games not JRPGs like its predecessor. Still the Vita does have some standouts. Ys Memories of Celceta and Persona  Golden are both excellent and mustplays. Final Fantasy XX and Disgaea  are still great games and its nice to have access to them on a portable. But other than that its empty. And I mean that. I can only come up with a few others JRPGs on the system currently even if you include the terrible ones.If were talking current offerings only DS has a pretty decent selection of JRPGs. There are two Etrian Odyssey games that are as good as they are lengthy hint very.  Bravely Default people claim to be the best Final Fantasy in years. Fire Emblem Awakening might just be the best game on the system and of the last few years. Pokemon XY is excellent. Monster Hunter  Ultimate is the nd best version of the best Monster Hunter to date the Wii U has it beat. There are three Shin Megami Tensei games on the system a great proper sequel SMTIV an updated rerelease of a Japaneseonly Saturn classic Soul Hackers and a slightly better version of an aboveaverage SRPG Devil Survivor Overclocked. Theres a new Mario amp Luigi game a new Rune Factory game that I hear is the best in the series a port of Tales of the Abyss and Unchained Blades an actually pretty good Etrian Odyssey clone Okay theyre not THAT similar. The DS takes it on an overall quality and quantity scale but if youre factoring in the Vitas backlog the scales flip the other way in terms of quantity quality is subjective. The DS has an incredible library but youll cant download them digitally so itll become impossible to pick them up there unless you bring them with you or import them or can read fluent Japanese.As for the rest of the games on the two systems it can be wrapped up pretty simply If you want indie games that youd find on the PC or on the major consoles like Hotline Miami Guacamelee or Spelunky pick up the Vita.If you want Nintendo games like Pokemon Smash Bros or Mario pick up a DS.Of course there are exceptions. Monster Hunter Ace Attorney and Mighty Switch Force on DS and Gravity Rush Tearaway and Danganronpa on the Vita for example. But the large majority of worthwhile tittles on both platformers fall under those categories.tldr  A Vita will get you access to retail and digital games and a ton of old JRPGs and great modern indie games but lacks new JRPGs and a vast library. A DS will get you only access to digital games but has a stellar current lineup of JRPGs and excellent Nintendo games.

1257132,0,t3_28h7i9,Im unclear as to whether you mean deep in gameplay or story. So some of these may not work for you.Id definitely recommend FTL for something small and deep gameplaywise. Lots and lots of decisions to make in a short time. It gets quite hectic but theres also a bit of planning you can do in how you approach things.Gunpoint is also small and takes a good bit of thinking and creativity assuming youre not going for sheer speed.Another one to look at is Defenders Quest. I havent finished it but so far it has a great and wellwritten story and rather interesting RPGtower defense gameplay. Your towers are party members with skills xp items etcI really want to recommend Brothers A Tale of Two Sons. Its pushing your space limits .gb and Im not sure how itd fare on the hardware youve got. However nothing surpasses Brothers for sheer depth of emotion.Lastly Id recommend The Swapper. Its a very thoughtful and contemplative puzzle game and extremely atmospheric.

My friend played through all of it and loved it but myself and many others couldnt get past the boring and awkward combat system. Witcher  is a  year old game and looks outdated by todays standards.There is an extensive modding community where you can pretty the game up and fix the combat system but why bother?

1271192,0,t3_28nln8,Not super happy with the sale so far mostly because I already own a lot of the games on sale gtgt  but heres some thoughts about the daily deals.The Walking Dead Season Two  TWD by TellTale is an awesome series and if youve played the first season and enjoyed it I would definitely recommend picking up the second season.  The Walking Dead season one is also on sale for  off . so if you want to invest in a good emotional series I would definitely recommend this one.Plague Inc Evolved  I played Plague Inc on my phone and while I enjoy it for a few minutes here and there on the computer in my opinion  off isnt very much.  It puts the game down to about  and if youre just looking for a very casual time sink thatd be a good bet.  The game is still in early access though.Prison Architect  This is another early access game but the devs release monthly updates and have done a TON to finish the game since it first went on sale.  I personally think its well worth  and they offer essentially the same packs they offered their kickstarters.  If you pay  you get the game the soundtrack the art book when theyre finished as well as the games Uplink very enjoyable hacker simulator Darwinia DEFCON and Multiwinia.  Its a very good deal in my opinion and I would heartily recommend Prison Architect.Game Dev Tycoon  Probably the best dev tycoon game available.  Its simple but not so simple to be boring.  Definitely worth the price at  imo.Flash SalesMount amp Blade Warband  Do you enjoy RPGs?  Do you enjoy slashemups?  Do you enjoy horse combat?  Do you enjoy intrigue?  MampBW is one of the best medieval RPGs out there including games like Skyrim.  It can be a little bit stat  detail heavy so if youre looking for a super casual experience it might not be for you.  You can mod it to hell and back though and popular mods includes one that turns it into Game of Thrones.  Again for  DEFINITELY worth the price.Spore  Its been a while since Ive played it but its one of the games that I never get tired of playing.  Its a little pricey in my opinion considering how old the game is and even at  off its still . but you can get the game and both expansions for  which isnt bad considering that the main game is  when its full priced.

Its a very simple game with simple controls no supercomplex systems and the level cap is low so it only takes a little while to get to the endgame content.    Guild Wars  works differently fundamentally than other MMOs or so Ive heard so maybe dont try that first since it could confuse you if you play more mainstream MMOs like WoW.

1318042,0,t3_29686s,I didnt think it was like AC.  I LOVED Dishonoredthere arent that many missions in the game but the levels are all diverse with a lot of ways to handle things.  Definitely a game with more depth than width which I liked.  In the end I guess it depends on why AC felt boring to youdo you enjoy stealth gameplay figuring out what would be the best way to sneak past guards or whether to be merciful or coldblooded when faced with a target?

Still could be worth a try  Ill probably at least give them a chance. I actually havent tried Still Life and it looks right up my alley.

Generally I prefer playing things in order but sometimes when stuff is too old or if later games stand alone well enough then Ill give earlier ones a skip.

1713388,0,t1_cjmk8in,Ok so over the weekend I played some  player multiplayer.To start off story mode multi is limited to two players so that was out. All the other modes we tried were team based.I believe there were  or  modes I wasnt choosing so I didnt see. These are the ones we triedBasketball. Its crazy and super fun. You are basically in a symmetrical level with baskets on either end. The ball drops in the middle of the arena at the beginning of the level after a basket is made and when the ball is destroyed by a weapon or the environment. This one was my favorite possibly because I solo dominated my friends at itKing of the hill In this mode you have either one large platform or multiple smaller platforms. The idea is that as long as you are standing on these platforms you are acquiring points every so many seconds  to   I would guess. This game was a lot of fun when the level boasted multiple platforms but with three players a single platform is not really competitive or fun.Capture the pony again in a symmetrical level each team has a pony on their side of the board. The goal is to get on your opponents pony and ride it to your side. With a little strategy two on one is simply not competitive. Combine that with the fact that I do not enjoy the pony mechanics of the game to make it one of my least favorite of the game modes.Straight up team vs killdamage your opponents for points. Even with three players this game was a ton of fun due to friendly fire. A misplaced grenade scored the one player team a substantial amount of points in our games. This mode was my second favorite and the one that captures the wackiness of the game the best OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.Capture the soul the final mode we played and my third favorite of the bunch. In this mode each player has a soul. If you are killed or jumped on your soul escapes and goes flying about the level. You can either retrieve your soul or your opponent can capture it. For each  to  second time increment you are in possession of an opponents soul you get a point. Two soulstwo points. In this way it is somewhat balanced in three player mode as the solo player can potentially earn twice the points of the larger team. However once my friends realized they only had to get a bit ahead in points then run away from me until time ran out I stopped winning and it became fairly boring.All that said I think with four players all the games would be a well balanced riot. I havent laughed that much during multiplayer in a game since SSBM.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cjv4v0e,2,t5_2ud8h

Hardcore mode makes every run a little different and you can just go stage by stage if you want to keep your upgrades. However as a roguelike its diversity is mainly on the different ways the game can actually go and the gameplay itself is pretty unchanging. Its also not very long with  levels in one full hardcore run. If youve watched some gameplay footage and arent completely sure about the  investment Id say wait a few weeks until some more content comes out that makes it more appealing. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,cjx31ey,3,t5_2ud8h

1753154,0,t3_2ehy53,At the price I thought why not?Now after playing it a bit. Ugh. It literally feels like every other shitty AAA third person cover shooter with Mass Effects skill wheel thrown in except it slows time as well. If youre looking for hardcore tactics this game isnt it. Positioning means fuck all when you are invincible behind the first available chest high wall. Occasionally moving left and right to dodge the infinite grenades the enemy has. You do absolutely no damage to anything and will run out of ammo every battle. In the first mission they expect you to shoot a gunship down and a sectopod with world war  era guns. It was only possible because the max ammo count for both weapons is enough for one gunship and you get an OP healing move every  seconds.But I mostly got it because I was interested in the XCOM universe and wanted to know about how it started. Whoops every character is cookie cutter flat and generic AAA trash down to the german scientist and broody lone wolf bad ass main character. Its like this game was trying to be a shittier version of mass effect.

1885963,0,t1_ckgdf8u,RE isnt exactly bad its just not as good as RE was. It didnt really live up to the standards and hype that had been set. It more than made up for it with the coop gameplay though Id still say its one of the best games of all time to play with a friend.    RE continued on this path but focused too much on the coop making other aspects of the game rather annoying toning down the inventory management and upgrade system that had become standard for RE games and just having way too many quicktime events. Its sad because it had so much potential so much hype but it was a pretty big letdown to most fans.    RE Revelations is sometimes called the true spiritual successor to RE despite originally being just for Nintendo DS. It brought back the survivalhorror roots and added in a rather unique Raid Mode for multiplayer.

2029839,0,t1_ckxsgf9,The world fills up with new creatures and items when you level up. So it doesnt point you to new territories or anything. New stuff will just pop up to say it like that. I didnt find the loot to be useless or unsatisfying. The loot drops also change based on your level as with a lot of RPGs but even if you get useless loot there is still a use for it crafting. Crafting is a pretty important and big part of the Elder Scrolls series and most RPGs fail to really deliver this in an interesting way in my opinion. So even if you got shitty loot you can always use it for crafting. Which in turn levels your crafting skill and unlocks some pretty neat stuff. Although I do have to say that the loot system isnt as satisfying as for instance Borderlands. You wont get heaps and heaps of stuff to pick from but it was still enough to get me going.The leveling system isnt something out of the ordinary but I still like the way they made it. The first few levels arent real gamechangers that is true. But it also has an upside if you decide later in the game that you want to focus your skills on something else instead you didnt really screw up yet. When you get past the first few levels you start to unlock perks with subtle but cool changes in your gameplay. For me they were just enough for me to approach my enemies in a different way. Later in the game you start to grow rapidly where you unlock game changing perks and other cool stuff. Skyrim is a slowpaced game. You wont level up as quickly as in other RPGs and you dont get heaps of loot. If you really want a faster game with these ingredients Id recommend Borderlands . It is definitely one of the coolest games I have ever played. It has a cool leveling system it has A LOT of loot it looks great and the gameplay is just awesome. I still suggest that you try Skyrim too. It would be a shame if you miss out on a game you may love because you stopped early in the game. Trust me itll be awesome!

2078123,0,t3_2ins1w,The first game isnt as bad as everyone says. It is repetitive to a degree but you do actually feel like an assassin in that game. The first one had the hardest group combat where you were actually punished for being caught. As the series progresses you can take    then  enemies at one time without much trouble. The overall metastory that ties the games together is not worth following after Revelations but for the first few games it doesnt hurt to play along. The first game is the best place to start where things are relatively simple and the mechanics are what you need to keep going. As you go through II and Brotherhood the quality goes up in terms of story graphics settings pretty much everything but the mechanics you acquire in I stay largely the same. After Brotherhood the series takes a distinct nosedive and I would recommend not going after those games at first. If you master I II and Brotherhood and are itching for more Revelations isnt a bad place to go but youll be somewhat disappointed in the story as well as metastory and by the largely ineffective mechanics they tried to introduce. Dont play III. IV is more of a pirate simulator than an assassin game. Some people like that it wasnt my particular cup of tea.TLDR Start at I. Play through II and Brotherhood.

2134603,0,t3_2j9b5x,I own Shadow of Mordor and have not played Evil Within yet plan on buying it in the next days probably.I would advise against Shadow of Mordor. I found the game to be way too easy and it gets easier the more you play because of more skill unlocks and weapon upgrades.Yes there is a lot to do orcs to control artifacts to find challenges to undertake etc but none of it was remotely challenging. Once you unlock a few certain skills you mow down hordes of orcs like wet tissue paper and probably regen health while doing so.Since you are familiar with the Arkham and Assassins Creed series this will probably apply to you too.The nemesis system is a great idea but I think it too suffers from the general lack of difficulty. In the beginning it was kinda cool some random orc captain suddenly shows up and fucks up my plans but later I would just annihilate them.The stealth sections are sometimes dodgy as hell. I repeatedly failed a mission where I had to kill x dudes without being detected even though sometimes the only person detecting me was the orc whose throat I was just slitting. During the kill animation a Mission Failed popped up even though there was nobody else there to witness the kill. Very frustrating.I found the main characters likable but some parts of the story were very asspully especially some parts near the very end.TLDR Worth it during a sale but not for the full price.,ShouldIbuythisgame,clb5l42,2,t5_2ud8h

I am levelling up a warlock now and I just feel tons more fragile but I also have a feeling I hurt a lot more.Anyways for hour complex mmo needs go to EVE. For a chill shooter you can play now and then on the ps pick destiny. I love spending a few hours in destiny when I come home from the gym late in the evening.

2146897,0,t3_2jl24q,Definitely Shadow of Mordor from a point of lasting longer. The nemesis system will make you enjoy the game prolonging it if you fall to a orc but also making it more satisfying using your time to track them down. Alien Isolation although having a nice atmosphere is relatively short and quite frankly not that scary for a horror game. Plus Isolation has a lot of DLC that will come out that will cost more money to prolong the story but since you said you spent money on christmas gifts you could be a bit short on change. tldr Shadow of Mordor,ShouldIbuythisgame,clcpx01,4,t5_2ud8h

Tough but fair with lots of dying in a simliar vein as Dark Souls.

2621191,0,t3_2pwp19,Both are really solid games but borderlands is a series that is really only good as a multiplayer game if you have a group of people that can and will be available to play with then its a really good experience. As a single player game it can be incredibly dull though. On the other hand Black flag is a fantastic open world style pirate game with tonnes of distractions between point A and B. I got it in the autumn sale it was  which was my trigger price for it but now its about  typical but I sunk about  hours into it in the first fortnight of having it.

2637625,0,t3_2q3f5t,Gameplay  FPSRPG hybrid there is a third person mode though. Reminds me of Deus Ex. Its pretty similar to other D Western RPGs of the time. You run around exploring a number of enclosed hubs within L.A. killing people and completing quests. It has a very gritty gothic feel to it. Story  You play as a vampire. Youre basically a pawn of various warring vampire factions and powerful figures who want to take control of the city. Theres also some end of the world stuff.

2734954,0,t3_2rdqin,Just naming a few.  My assumption is youre new to the genre and want to get into it so Ill be tossing in a few good ones and at least one hard oneThe Inner World  is a moderately easy and fun one.  The puzzles are a little on the absurd though logical side and the plot is intruiging but whats nice is the intuitive hint system which plays at your own pace so you never really get stuck but dont have an easy time either.Ben Jordan Paranormal Investigator  is an episode series of PampC Adventures that play in the vein of leisure suit larry.  Before Telltale invented the episodic formula this series had already begun playing with the idea of having an overarching plot within its miniplots really escalating at ep  though before culminating in the finale.  But the best part about this series is that its FREE.  All episodes take roughly  hours with no hints with the final  in the series probably taking longer they were made a year and  years apart respectively.A Tale of Two Kingdoms  Just gorgeous oldschool PampC created as a love letter to oldbies like Kings Quest and Quest for Glory.  Absolutely epic plot writing and scripting.  Just note though that you CAN die in this game but not as much so save often.  Im only linking this because it is once again FREE and too good not to pass up.  At least give it a whirl with a guide in hand.The Blackwell Series  Legacy Unbound Convergence and Deception and its latest and final game Epihpany which just came out last year  What can only be best described as a Commercial version of Ben Jordan.  Both games just having come out at around the same time when they started both games play the same way having come from the same engine and both games having the same supernatural slant in terms of the plot.  Excellent voice acting music graphics and gameplay with around roughly the same length.And speaking of that series anything from its publisher Wadjet Eye is worth looking into as wellPrimordia  takes place in an endoftheworld scenario where humans are extinct and robots have taken over.  Its pretty grim at times but has a dash of humor mixed into it.Resonance  has a more scifi plot to it concerning  protagonists of the eponymous event which is this alternative to energy that can hold consequences of its own.  I shant reveal too much into it as the plot is quite good.Finally Primordia brings Machinarium to mind.  Its beautiful and not a single word is uttered throughout the game.  Its also a little more upbeat than Primordia obviously though its puzzles tend to be a bit out there sometimes.  This one takes at least  days to finish.Anyways whatever you choose I hope you enjoy them.  Theres a ton of other gems out there but these are the simplest I can think of without being too simple.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cneyakg,5,t5_2ud8h
2736624,0,t3_2rdqin,The Book of Unwritten Tales  A popculture comedy pointandclick with a great sense of humor thats very reminiscent of older pointandclick games. The difficulty is very good not too hard but not too easy and the story is a humorous take on The Lord of the Rings.

When you die in a Souls game you know its because either you fucked up or youre just not high enough level to be here yet.  Dark Souls  eliminates the latter quite a bit the world isnt as immediately open as its predecessor.  Some people enjoy that some dont.    That being said Dark Souls is quite slow and methodical.  Dont get me wrong your pulse will be pounding the entire time but its not the allout brawl that the Arkham games are.

3074366,0,t1_cogn5cr,I feel like Gabriel Knight was good when it came out but trying to hold its story against more recent ones  and I actually played it after Primordia  the numerous areas where it fell very short were very obvious. I also want to at least sympathies somewhat with the main character somewhat when Im playing a game and GK just felt like it was assuming Id automatically either like or want to be like Mr. Look At Me Im A Horny White Dude And Women Just Fall At My Feet. Needless to say I didnt. Not a surprise at all about the DS  DS thing  but oh boy I CAN HELP WITH THE ALREADY DONE IT LIST. I dont see Gun Mute there so do give that a go because it is very fast paced for a text game and also fun. Here are several others that I thoroughly enjoyed and thought were also great! It helps that youve played Slouching since thats kind of long  involved which means I can probably rec more in the same vein.  Vespers  If you liked Slouching play this! Its damn good and has astounding pacing for a piece of Interactive Fiction. Normally I also run into the problem which youve mentioned about games feeling slow  there are some with large worlds which I guess are nice but I spend so long wandering around them that I end up getting lost plot wise. Not so with this one  about as soon as you figure something out or realize whats going on time moves on. It never feels static and the writing is stellar.  FailSafe  Its short! And to quote Emily Short on it because she summarizes it better than I can  A brief game with a novel premise that it would be disastrous to describe. This work plays some interesting games with the playerplayercharacterparser identities. It also turns off metaverbs so be prepared for the fact that you wont be able to save and restore. The game is so brief thought that it probably wont matter much. Definitely worth a try..  Alabaster  Yeah I think youll enjoy this one. The focus of this game is exploring the text  each playthrough is very short but theres so much variation in terms of how things go and how your actions and your choice drives the slowlyrevealed overarching narrative that its one game you can keep coming back to until youve found everything about it out. Its like a much more character driven Aisle with an actual plot to it rather than just a setting. Strongly recommended.  First Draft of the Revolution  This one isnt so much a puzzle as truly interactive fiction. Theres a piece of fiction and you interact with it. Its very difficult to describe without spoiling how it goes but its also one of the more engaging pieces Ive seen recently and what I especially like about it is that the kind of story it tells is not one thats often seen. Bonus!   Days which is actually a lot of fun and if you havent tried it out do! The you have  Days time limit does keep things moving along at a nice clip and the sheer amount of places to go and things to see gives it a lot of replay value can you beat your time? try to visit a particular city? hit just  days? what about an alternate route and so on. Im not reccing stupid insanely long games like Varicella and Spider and Web because while they are good holy shit they are also hard and take a lot of time and dedication to complete. I did enjoy them but I would say for someone whos played them on and off and finds them slightly slow that you probably dont want to jump into those straight away. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,cognmjy,1,t5_2ud8h

3087093,0,t1_cohx4h8,The problem with the show is that they try so hard to extend it to fulfill their seasonal quota.  There are literally episodes where the progression only happens after waiting on  minutes of filler.  There are moments however where that stretching shines like how the fleshed out The Governor but Id rather frankly choose the Novels version of killing him off instantly.  If this were a british show perhaps Id have a different opinion as those rarely try to do fillers.  I also heard that the original director got shafted after season  and season  actually tried to pattern the novel respectfully and closely.Anyways yea you should try TellTales early stuff.

3225748,0,t3_2x1qud,So I really miss what used to be a simple powerful FPS game. I love games that require skill but still make you feel wildly powerful. In that vein I have a few. None of them are unheard of but rather just not very popular on this sub  Hard Reset essentially a more modern and serious take on Serious Sam ironic given the name which is a nocover shooter that is actually super difficult.  Bulletstorm a beautiful game that isnt especially difficult but incredibly fun game due to the variety of ways to kill someone and points system associated with it. Combos and creativity are rewarded in the same way as they would in Devil May Cry.  Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army a game that is multiplayeronly version of Sniper Elite V. Its mostly close to mid range but the scarcity of machine gun ammo makes the challenge being able to zoom and scope really quickly before the evil skeleton can reach you.Shout out to Resident Evil  as well People got so caught up in hating it for the fact that it lost all semblance of what they wanted a Resident Evil game to be. In doing so they missed the truth which is that the multiplayer in this game is fucking great and Ive yet to find another co op game that is as much fun.

3374154,0,t3_2ytmpn,Dragon Age II is grindy and the story isnt nearly as epic in scale. HOWEVER if you plan on playing Dragon Age Inquisition WHICH YOU ABSOLUTELY DEFINITELY SHOULD ITS SO FUCKING GOOD then Id recommend it just because the story mentions A LOT of details from DA II which arent NECESSARY to play the game but youll feel like youre missing out.My advice When you play DA II dont expect an epic adventure dont expect deep gameplay be prepared to grind sometimes and instead expect a fascinating characterdriven greek soap opera as one reviewer referred to it.Also I believe there are mods for the game that help chop out the shitty parts a little bit.If you go into the game strictly for the characters and a few background details that they in my opinion skillfully weave into the world later that matter you may find yourself enjoying it.

4087438,0,t3_37eax2,After thinking about it I realized your wife might enjoy more traditional adventure games.  Check out The Chains of Satinav which is decent and its sequel Memoria which is superb.  But wait for them to be on sale they were recently at Humble for  and  each respectively.  The normal  price is too high for Satinav and probably too high for Memoria although I really love Memoria and wouldnt have felt cheated if Id paid that much.Major differences these games are pointandclick adventures where youre typically solving puzzles to move ahead.  They have good voicing but theyre not really movieish.  The graphics are handdrawn D not stylized D. They also typically dont have very many meaningful choices youre solving the puzzles and enjoying the story but you dont usually have a very strong impact on how the story comes out.

I may do exactly that during the upcoming Steam sale if not only for the space battles which were cool as hell. To me though dying didnt have much consequence if that makes sense? Like if you die you respawn as a different soldier. While with Mount and Blade you have to sacrifice your troops to retreat or you fight and get captured losing your troops in the process. Lots of consequences to a death. I played it to death unmodded but never explored the modding scene for it. I understand theres some pretty expansive mods to look into too. Also got my eye on Bannerlords whenever it should release.I picked up Dont Starve during the Steam Roguelike sale not long ago but havent played it yet. Ill install it tonight and give it a go.And Im pretty sure I have a key for NEO Scavenger in my Humble Bundle inventory so Ill redeem that for myself rather than giving it away as I planned to. Sounds rather interesting.Cheers for the suggestions.,ShouldIbuythisgame,crt5dti,5,t5_2ud8h

I played wolfenstein d as a kidmindless classic shooter and Return to Castle Wolfensteinstandard FPS with spooky occult elements but not much depth.  Im really impressed with the New Order.

4195732,0,t3_38wgg8,You should play them both. I played them for the first time this year and really had a blast. I recommend  before .  is surprisingly short  hours for me whereas  is bigger and generally seen as better in every way.Copypasting a part of my old post for some helpful tips Mods. Fallout Fixt is apparently a good one I only used a resolution patch and a fanmade bugfixing patch and still ran into a couple of bugs. At first I had really weird colors in the game but installing the resolution patch fixed it. If you use a resolution patch theres one location in the game where advancing was impossible at least for me. Save games between unpatched and Fixtpatched games are incompatible your only way to advance is to temporarily change the resolution back to x. You might want to look up a guide for character creation though youll want to avoid looking at the walkthrough itself the game isnt all that obscure. Not all characters are created equal and it seems very easy to gimp yourself even on the easiest difficulty. I looked up a character from a guide and still had some problems early in the game on Easy might want to only change to harder difficulties later. When you finally get to play you need to know that your cursor has two modes a movement mode and an inspection mode. You swap between these modes by rightclicking. In movement mode the cursor is a hexagon in inspection mode its a traditional mouse cursor. You interact with the environment in inspection mode. Click the body to loot it drag the items from the corpses inventory to your inventory by dragging. Note that even in inventory there are two cursor modes with one you move the items with another you inspect them. When in inspection mode by keeping the left mouse button pressed you get another menu from which you can either use or drop the item. Combat is turnbased and is based on Action Points AP which are the small circles above your weapon. Movement attacking reloading and opening the inventory will consume AP swapping between the two items weapons you have in quick slots will not. You can change the fire mode by rightclicking the weapon. This is how you change whether you want an unaimed shot aimed shot or a reload. You can swap between the quickslotted items with the middle mouse button press on the scroll. You can sneak steal lockpick heal etc from the Skilldex menu that should be easy enough to spot. Save often and try to have at least two save slots that you keep fairly up to date. Game was made in the Clinton era shit can happen.If youre not grabbed by the game just try again later. When you start again youll be more familiar with the systems and will have a better time with the game.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cryiduo,2,t5_2ud8h

4291251,0,t3_3a4wre,Oh man there is so so muchFirst to answer your question on Ryse. It was an Xbox One launch title and therefore there isnt a lot of meat there. Its shallow and repetitive and honestly your money probably better spent elsewhere. I too am wondering about Total War Rome II.For FPSTeam Fortress  is a must to at least try out and see if its your thing as its free. I think its outstanding and there really isnt anything else quite like it. Counterstrike Global Offensive its cheap and is very very good. Can be brutally difficult as many players have been playing for years now but dont let that put you off. Its growing at a rapid rate and there are tons of new players to the series. Wolfenstein New Order a single player only game but is very good. Its an old school shooter that can be played stealthy at times but I loved it playing balls to the wall with dual assault rifles. Its great fun with boss fights to boot. Plays smoothly and looks great as well. Insurgency Multiplayer only again. This lands somewhere between Counterstrike and Call of Duty. Not as competitive and strategic as CS but not as fast paced and run and gun as CoD. Battlefield  if you are looking for larger scale battles with vehicles this is your game.As for strategyYou mentioned you like Civ V and thats obviously a must have. As I said I havent played Total War Rome II yet but from most recommendations about that series pick the time period and setting you like the most and go for it so Id assume this is good and I know Shogun II is nearly always recommended as is its expansion Fall of the Samurai. Cities Skylines I suppose you could call this strategy. Its a city builder and its fantastic with the best Dev team you could imagine who post here routinely and really listen to suggestions and work with modders. Its absolutely great and I think its far better than even the Sim City games of old. Company of Heroes and expansions and this is  not  these are on sale and in bundles constantly now for next to nothing. They are focused on WWII and are fantastic. I highly recommend it for how cheap it goes constantly. Starcraft  You need the expansion if you want to play multiplayer. Good news though I believe it and its expansion are both on sale right now as well even though they arent on steam. Its the best RTS out currently with an active scene hands down. Campaigns are good too even if you want it for the singleplayer. Great great games if you are into RTS. Door kickers modern war tactical RTS with a pause button where you control a small squad of guys. You can plan a whole mission at the beginning and press play and watch how it works make changes on the fly or do it all in real time. A lot of fun. Faster Than Light FTL  a kind of RTS with pause. Only the battles are real time and you can pause every other second if you wish to plan out your move. Its very difficult to win the game but there is a ton of content there if you get into it. Great game that also has an Ipad version that is fantastic if you own one. RPGsFull disclosure Not really my category. I dont play these often. I havent played it but Witcher  has apparently knocked it out of the park with that game. Again amazing devs who are well worth supporting. Skyrim very good game with amazing modding scene. Big open world to explore and tons of stuff to do. Easily  hours of content even before mods. Mass Effect series one of the highest reviewed series ever. Supposed to be very good but I wouldnt know. Fallout  or New Vegas debated often which one is better. Again I wouldnt know but to fans of RPGs they are both highly regarded. OthersPortal  and  Must haves. Puzzle games made by Valve that are often dirt cheap. I think both for  routinely if I remember correctly. Torchlight  made by many of the guys behind Diablo . Its very good and even better coop. also Path of Exile thats free would fit here as wellChivalry Medieval Warfare exactly as it sounds. Fighting with swords and armor. Different classes give you different weapons that behave differently. A bunch of different game modes and a whole lot of fun. Sleeping Dogs thats currently a daily deal is very good as well. Its an open world game but there isnt much to do in the open world. However the story and game play are very good and the game looks great. Far Cry  or  excellent open world games that look great. You really only really need one of these as  is basically more of the same from . Well thats the best I can do off the top of my head. There are obviously tons more but thats a good start at least. Have fun and welcome to PC gaming. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,cs9cg5z,16,t5_2ud8h

Im really happy I had nothing better to do because it turned out to be one of my favourite games after the latest episodes.The characters are cliche at first glance but they are deeper than they appear.  Pay attention to the smaller details and you might find you have some things in common.  One of the characters I didnt like at first had a similar childhood to me.  After a few episodes I noticed we shared a few of the same tendencies and learned something about myself.  I cant promise the same experience but the characters are more thought out than their first impression implies.Telltale games made the only other point and click rpgs Ive played and the genre continues to surprise me.

4730485,0,t1_ctqt4q2,Its gonna be the same combat between both. NWN will allow far far more customization though seeing hows its DnD. If you wanna try something different maybe give The Last Remnant a try. Its an RPG but the combat works by issuing orders to squads of units that you train form up and equip. You really have to aware of the battlefield because being flanked is pretty bad and being attacked from the rear is death. Youll control more squads with more units as the story progresses. In chapter the combat is a bit limited and kind of a long tutorial. After that youll have much more freedom.My last suggestion is Valkyria Chronicles. Think Xcom but instead of commanding units to move and shoot you do the moving and aiming after selecting a unit. The aiming is less FPS gun play and more aim at head for high damage but low accuracy or aim for center mass then press shoot. Also everyone over watches all the time so you cant just run across an open field to cover on the other side on your turn. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,ctqtie9,1,t5_2ud8h

5188690,0,t3_3m2lmd,Heres what I recommend. Play through the rest of the side missions in ground zeroes first. Not only will this help you in The Phantom Pain if you get it but will more or less give you an idea how each of the missions will be. Its a lot of visiting the same locations doing very similar extraction assassination or sabotage missions. If you get bored of that type of thing quickly then youll get bored of TPP. Unfortunately there are only a few missions with the amount of production value and story as in the GZ main ops. At the beginning somewhere in the middle and right at the end are the most climatic moments. If you want to finish the main story it can be done quickly under  hours on average.However if you actually do want more missions like the side ops in GZ then get TPP. Its a game packed to the brim with content that lets you utilize the many tools in the game to creatively execute missions in any way youd like. Similar to a Hitman game you are given a sandbox environment to sneak your way into and use whatever means necessary to do your mission. Difficulty is dynamic and scales nicely with some of the later missions being fairly difficult. There isnt much of a story reason to do any of these missions so much as they are just helpful for upgrading your base. Which makes up about  of your game time. Managing the base can be fun for some people and tedious for others but TPP seems to automate most of it. You simply gather the resources staff and money to research equipment build additional structures etc.To put it simply it is worth the  if you wish to invest in a game that lasts about  hours for total completion. If you enjoy Metal Gear for its cutscenes dialogue or varied mission objectives then youll probably be disappointed. The game is very fun but GZs main ops is very misleading as most missions are nowhere near that long or interesting. I can say personally that it was worth the money and the wait despite the disappointing story it is still a very refined and fun open world game.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cvbfe84,5,t5_2ud8h
5195873,0,t3_3m5zk6,Well the obvious answer is something like Crypt of the Necrodancer where you can listen to either the very good soundtrack or just import your own tracks in for wacky hijinks if thats your thing! Alternatively other nice games where you can import your own tracks and zone out to are Audiosurf which is really just straightforwardly good and a very well made experience and terrific for just settling back to play and Beat Hazard which to sum it up is basically Space Invaders with a custom soundtrack. In terms of integrating music and gameplay and also providing an engaging experience I think these three are probably the ones Id rec the highest. ...As for the game I actually did zone out to while listening to music the most though I have to admit its probably just standard MMORPGs like WoW and Rappelz.

If youre interested in nonstory coop game modes like Fucking Run really force players to work together.Its likely a very dated game by now but I definitely enjoyed ObsCure on the PlayStation  since teamwork was emphasized. Extremely fun was PermaDeath for the characters so you kinda dont want any character to die. Its a choice of  characters and you can switch out between them at any time while youre at the base you can only play  at a time thoughThere isnt really a shared inventory though for any of these games.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cvxgyjg,2,t5_2ud8h

The games quests are very simplistic imo and there isnt much to the storyline. The main driver for the gameplay seems to be grinding money for upgrades or better ships either through bounties mining or trading. Its listed as RPG on the Steam page Id say its RPG lite at best.

5777385,0,t3_3ua8y3,To answer your question about Fallout  or New Vegas? which is something gamers will probably be arguing about till the end of time personally I found the plot of New Vegas much more intriguing there are more distinct factions morality isnt as black and white as it is in  and everything you do feels a lot more integrated with the story sidequests etc. That being said  is hands down a better open world being set in the urban remnants of D.C. you can imagine that there will be a lot more to explore and do in  than in the desert wasteland where NV is set. As for the DLCs I personally didnt find s DLC to be that enjoyable although it should be noted that Broken Steel basically adds a proper ending to the game. The Pitt is pretty good but the rest just felt kind of bland like another corridor with new wallpaper to explore. NVs DLC had a lot more personality IMO. Even Dead Money which I personally did not like bc the enemies were very bullet spongy had a lot of personality and character. I would say that the GOTY version is kind of required for both games in  it is because the ending without DLC is kind of shitty and in NV it is because it actually adds a lot of interesting chapters to do on the side. Both base games will easily net you  hours gameplay each without the DLC.Edit if you are on the fence I think its worth mentioning Ive seen both games for cheaper on Steam so you may want to wait one month for the Winter sale if you want to save a buck or two,ShouldIbuythisgame,cxd8m8j,1,t5_2ud8h

The local newspapers have been raving about it for months and they made it sound like it would be a great place to spend time and maybe even some money. But no theres nothing. Just endless gorgeous dcor beautiful storefronts and smiling faces. Before long you get uncomfortable at the lapse between the high quality presentation and the lacklustre content and begin to feel an unpleasant jarring feeling which you cant explain.You leave the mall feeling a burden lift that you didnt even realise was there. It turns out the weather is actually pretty good outside.. Cold yet bright the sun low in the sky.. And as you leave the cloying atmosphEAre you take a deep breath exhaling a fog into the crisp winter air.

5987225,0,t1_cy4gddn,I wouldnt say its not a good game I havent tried the first Witcher to compare but Ive heard Witcher fans saying not to play Witcher  and ME fans never say to skip ME. The main things that are annoying about it are the clunky combatweapon and armor modding system which is just a timesuck. You may just want to play on an easier combat setting than you normally would and not mess around with it more than you have to. But there are also really cool things. Its the only actual openworld ME game where you can take the MAKO out and drive it around on planets. And the story is fantastic with the best villain of the series maybe. And theres a fanmade allinone texture mod that replaces all the textures with highres versions so it looks good on PC. Most importantly the story of ME reallllly depends on your emotional connection to the characters especially at the beginning. The first thing you do is go around and recruit your crew from the first game. You will miss on a lot of the emotional hit if you dont go through the full journey with them. So I would just play it for sure.

6023493,0,t1_cy9729w,Im pretty unhappy with ED in general so I didnt purchase horizons. It seems to be just more unfinished boring things to do with a novelty factor that wears off within a couple days. It adds nonatmospheric landings atmospheres is another future dlc crafting systems and some other things. I can not recommend you get horizons but then again I really cant recommend you get the base game itself anyways.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cy97awg,1,t5_2ud8h

6064752,0,t3_3yk5o1,Havent played SR IV just got it a few days ago but I sank many hours into III even though I didnt manage to complete it lost my savefile and didnt bother starting over from scratch and into different GTAs basically all of em from way back with the first game up to IV aint got the dosh to get V yet.SR is lots of fun but its and I cant stress this enough ludicrously silly when compared to GTA. GTA has always had its moments but its fairly down to earth. SR has you using motorized dildos to fight off zombies while celebrity guests join you only to be interrupted by cyborg ninjas on a turf war with scifi soldiers and mexican luchadores with furry fetish enthusiasts running away in terror. And thats only III. From what Ive read the theme around IV is superpowers which sounds like lots of fun but Ive heard people mention it a makes the game too easy and b takes the focus too much away from cars and guns why even use them?So in the end its a pretty fun innovative game with shit youd never even dream of finding in GTA worth checking out cant talk about the DLC because as I mentioned I havent tried IV yet. However if what interests you the most about GTA is the story or more grounded sandbox gameplay then SR may not be what you expected. As far as I can tell it pretty much stopped being a GTA clone after .  ,ShouldIbuythisgame,cyeky5t,3,t5_2ud8h
6068796,0,t3_3ymm83,I love the game to death but if you are looking for real meaningful choices Life is Strange is probably not the game. I can only really think of one decisionbased event I would say has a large impact. Others are more an illusion of choice as you mentioned. I dont really mind the illusion but if you do then that may be a deal breaker.That being said the story is really good IMO. The characters in particular are great and have really stayed with me long after finishing the game.,ShouldIbuythisgame,cyf3xds,3,t5_2ud8h

6110171,0,t3_3z7nda,Portal . Community levels are amazing. Theres also extended mods like Portal Stories Mel that basically extend the game. Theres enough content to last you much longer than the main questIf you cant justify the purchase with mods and communities Id suggest looking into the talos principle. I bought it at the beginning of the sale and I played around  hours in about  days. Amazing atmosphere and great puzzles as well.Transistor was a fun game. Ive never played Bastion but its by the same studio so I imagine my impression of that game would be somewhat similar. The game had a good story line and unique combat you can probably watch videos to see if the combat style is for you. What really struck me was the art style and the music. Fucking gorgeous.Overall Id pick Portal . Im extremely biased toward puzzles though so take it with a grain of salt,ShouldIbuythisgame,cyk5x00,1,t5_2ud8h

6121283,0,t1_cykwm91,Completely agree. I started playing the series because Id heard it was a tough and challenging game but after you realise this game requires patience and for you to learn from mistakes its not that hard.What keeps you playing the game is the lore and story. Its beautifully complex and theres a tonne of room for interpretation of the lore. Nothing is given to you really theres pieces given to you and your mind fills in the rest.Edit I forgot to say after Id finished the game a few times I really didnt understand too much I watched a few lore videos on YouTube and a lot of it clicked.

6223972,0,t3_40sxp8,Lords of the Fallen is kinda like Dark Souls but there are things you should know before buying Theres no dedicated mage. Unlike DS where you have lots of spells LotF has only  spell trees each has  spells. Few of them are pretty bad but the rest work well Combat is slower. Your character feels a lot slower when swinging weapons and dodging. Thats not bad though and doesnt make the game easier either Boss battles are way harder. The bosses are really welldone but youll have to learn how to fight them so expect some deaths Strength is easy mode since the weapons deal huge damage and the shields can block almost everything. Dexterity is hard mode you need good timing to combo attacks and dodge a lot. Faith is kinda in the middle but I had no problems with itIts not Dark Souls but I enjoyed it a lotI havent played CoD Ghosts but it has a bad reputation and Fallout  is an overhyped game and no one wants to assume its not as good as it should be.

6285362,0,t3_41oiaz,Not worth it.  Whats currently available to play is incredibly buggy prealpha stuff and has been for years now.  If you buy it now youre going to sit and stare at long load screens then spend about  minutes in a janky as fuck game before crashing.  Rinse and repeat as many times as you can stomach.  Whats currently available to play is NOTHING like whats being shown in videos.  Wait until the game is either released or a stable beta build is out.

6345621,0,t3_42iu52,A lot of Early western RPGs are based directly off of DnD Rulesets. So if you dont mind dated graphics Baldurs Gate  and  planescape Torment Icewind dale  and  Neverwinter Nights.Then there are the more modern CRPGs that use similar systems not not dnd itself. The best example of this is Pillars of Eternity which is a homage to old cRPGs down to the artstle it just looks a lot better visually. Then there are the D RPGS that developed from the classic RPGs like Dragon Age Origins and Knights of the old Republic both games are fantastic. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,czaxdo2,1,t5_2ud8h

6363659,0,t1_czcw02n,The only thing that comes to mind for me in that type of gameplay that even comes close is Sheltered but it isnt quite that type of game.  I would check it out though.  Outside of the postapocalyptic theme there is a few others you might like Factorio Build up factories and such.  This War of Mine Again not quite the same type of basebuilding but it comes to mind because it is very similar to the theme you are looking for.  You are a family in a war stricken nation irc and you have to try to survive.  Planetbase Set up a colony on mars... how long can it really survive.  KeeperRL This has you being a bad guy attacking towns and such after you build up your lair.  XCOMEnemy Unknown or XCOM Enemy Within This is getting into stretch land for what you are asking for because the base building is the secondary game play where the tactics on the field is whats important. Apparently in my head there isnt much choice given those restrictions... There is plenty more if you start getting into the survival realm of things... you can go from Dont Starve to Crashlands to Rust shivers. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,czcz7e1,3,t5_2ud8h

6545863,0,t3_45aptt,ArmA is an excellent series and Arma  is no exception. For solo play I wouldnt really recommend it. The campaign is fairly lackluster and though the editor is fun to create missions and scenarios with its not really the driving force behind the game and takes a little bit of work to get an understanding of.What makes this game fundamentally amazing is when you play missions online with a group. The neat thing about the world we live in today is that thats actually a fairly easy thing to do. You can join a hardcore milsim group or an easygoing group that likes to get together once a week to play missions. Its up to you based on how much time you want to commit but quick searches on the steam forums will direct you to groups of all sorts looking for new folks. Personally Id recommend the th you can find them on Steam as theyre a great bunch of guys that are pretty easygoing. Overall the game is definitely worth the  if you put in the work for the right mods and the right group. If youre looking for something to immediately entertain you out of the box Id say look elsewhere. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,czwe8sf,5,t5_2ud8h

The gameplay is perfect but also has a base building metagame around it. The only bad thing about it was the rushed ending that feels a bit unfinished. It feels x more fleshed out than JC in every way possible. Its much more of an experience that you wont forget for a long time. I have an indepth review if you want to take a look. JC is more of a sandbox experience that I like playing for a few hours every once in a while. It has a lot of things to do but for no real reason.

6916600,0,t3_4af2nh,Ive played through both games multiple times.Whilst its a great and confusing experience to learn more about the story and they fix some issues that were in the first one its a lot more harsh than HL almost unfairly.The levels are much much larger and have a lot more windows so you have to do that screen movement thing to see where the enemies are to plan ahead and make sure that you have a gun pretty much the whole time. Either that or the tactic of just peaking out of a door quickly then going back inside to wait as the enemies come to you. Its such a shame in my opinion because I really felt that the games perform better as hectic close quarters melee fests but sadly I felt the second game kind of made it a much slower and less enjoyable game. Saying that though the music is still great and the game is essentially the same except you now have a variety of abilities depending on what character you choose. Add to that the level editor which should be released soon I think or has been Im not sure which will make people create some more traditional levels and Id say its worth the purchase.

7217616,0,t3_4eayer,So if you look at what you get with the Intro Pack you only get the first mission of the game plus the tutorials. The first mission takes place at a Paris Fashion show and you have to kill a couple of people but honestly if you play through it yourself it will only take you  hours to do. The gameplay is supplemented by letting you replay the SAME mission over and over again with different challenges restrictions. There are also user generated contracts in the same area where you need to murder specific people in a specific way.The Full Experience is the Paris mission plus upcoming missions in Italy Morocco Thailand USA and Japan for a total of  levels total. These arent released yet but will be slowly released in the next few months episodically. Unfortunately right now even if you purchase the Full Experience you only have access to the Paris mission.In my opinion theres no reason to buy the Full Experience. Having to play the same levels over and over again is really dull and boring to be honest. Im a longtime hitman Fan and even though I appreciate the extended freedom and experimentation Im allowed I can only see the same area and the same people so many times before Im bored. That being said if youre a fan of the older Hitman games Paris is one of the most densely populated and alive feeling levels in any Hitman game Ive ever played although Im pretty sad that  will only get a total of  missions to play around in.Are you a fan of Hitman games? If I were you id just get the intro pack for  dollars or so and see if its your cup of tea.

7607508,0,t1_d36orx1,In my opinion as a notaslong hardcore fan as a lot of monster hunter players I only REALLY started getting fully into it in MHU the latest western release game until MHX comes out in a few months I think I could relate to you most currently. I also dont have a lot of friends to play with currently although a few here and there. I have come to realise that a lot of it is dependent upon your own goals and how far you are willing to push yourself. If youre not the type of person willing to kill the same monster a few times to get that one rare drop to get that cool looking  stronger weapon then you might find yourself losing interest quickly. However if youre the type of person who sets their own goals in openended games then I think monster hunter is a good place to come. Theres a strange satisfaction in struggling with a monster and then killing it a few more times and realising you dont need to use as many potions youre killing it a lot more youre breaking parts more often etcetc. If youre not too worried about the expenses I definitely would recommend at least giving it a shot! That said like others have said the new MH Monster Hunter Gen  Cross comes out around Jul th For us Aussies Jul th in America I think so you could consider waiting for that.,ShouldIbuythisgame,d36xmum,1,t5_2ud8h

Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero Mission are incredible. Super Metroid is also an old game with immense replay value dunno if you ever played those or not. If you havent you should repent for your sins now.,ShouldIbuythisgame,d38j78g,1,t5_2ud8h

7638075,0,t3_4jw4ew,Unless something drastic has changed dont get World In Conflict unless its really cheap and youre okay with something really short. Its a multiplayer game with a single player storyline thats intended to teach you how to play and when I last checked there was pretty much noone playing online. I really enjoyed the game but its too short and the intention is to proceed on to the multiplayer game but without anyone playing it then theres no second part. There are gameplay videos and it pretty much plays how it looks and as described by sully.Of all the games Ive played its one of the few that Im sad that they didnt make a sequel. The graphics hold up fairly well even  years later and the game was fun.

Do note that it is unfortunately all RNGbased if you dont want to pay but I dont think that it will be too difficult to get the cosmetic items you want as over time youll get more and more duplicates since youll own more of the items youll have a higher chance at getting dupes and thus credits from the loot crates.,ShouldIbuythisgame,d3irxvz,2,t5_2ud8h

7794229,0,t3_4m2c9i,I played through Mafia  a total of  times. I absolutely loved the game and I always went back to it when I got fed up with other titles.I tried to play both story DLCs which Im assuming youre referring to but didnt have a very good time. I completed Jimmys Vendetta and gave up about halfway through Joes Adventures. Theyre both very focused on action shooting lots of enemies blowing up cars and the like and that somehow ruined the atmosphere for me. Theres also a sort of mission timer and you get a score based on how fast you complete the mission and how much mayhem you cause. Of course you can completely ignore that but the actual story aspect is very lacking especially in Jimmys so theres really not much point in playing it unless you want to do a good job at it. If you enjoyed Mafia  so much that you really want to play it again but dont want to go though the story then you could pick up the DLCs. However you should first consider whether you enjoyed Mafia  more because of the shooting and arcade driving or more because of the general atmosphere.,ShouldIbuythisgame,d3s4ogz,3,t5_2ud8h
7794605,0,t1_d3rwmrl,gt Would you say it was easy to understand and play?Yes.

There are mouseover tooltips for just about everything ton the screen and an ingame Civilopedia where you can look up game mechanicsconcepts as well as historical tidbits.Overall I think its probably the most approachable game Ive every played.,ShouldIbuythisgame,d3s67da,1,t5_2ud8h

There are awesome action sequences and beautiful areas that leaves you just standing and looking. There are a whole bunch of Optional Challenge Tombs the range from awareness checks to real head scratchers I had a hard time resisting the challenge whenever I passed one. The gunplay is fun and there are god stealth elements however they dont bring anything new to the table. Lastly if you have the PC for it this game can be really really beautiful.

7953908,0,t3_4nwj4b,People tend to get rabid whenever BG is mentioned but for a st time CRPG player I would go with Dragon Age Origins instead.DnD and therefore BG game mechanics tend to be much more suited to a PnP session where you would only have  encounters per hour rather than every  minutes the game does.  The fightrest fightrest fightrest mechanics get very tiresome after a while especially for perrest spellcasters.Admittedly the BG story is much better than DAO but the game mechanics of DAO are much better.  Much of the deservedly so praise of BG is for its story and characters while nostalgia and rosetintedglasses tend to brush over how clunky the game mechanics are when converted to a PC game.An example DnD rulesets can completely screw over your character build unless you are already familiar with the ruleset and as a st time player this is a real risk.

7955448,0,t1_d4a7hdk,Rome  starts with defined borders and mostly predictable directions to conquer in the early game while Attila is a bit more chaotic with the Roman empire being broken up and crumbling with various raiders vying to take roman settlements western europe really becomes anyones game. Then in the east the huns are always advancing and can become a huge threat by midgame. I guess mechanics wasnt the right term because really the only new gameplay mechanic from Rome  to the Attila campaign is horde mechanics but rather the political landscape of Attila is a lot more interesting imo where as Rome  it is a lot more clear cut and predictable.This is all just talking about the campaign map in actual battles they are very similar besides aesthetic of the time period.

8039371,0,t3_4pap4q,Couple suggestions Factorio is similar to a city builder but focused on just building a giant factory. There is a very minimal amount of attention needed since your factory grows at your speed. Eventually you work into automating a lot of the tasks that you would be doing. There are enemies in the game that will continue to grow but theres an option when you create your world to have them be passive never attack you without you attacking them first or disable them completely. I think this fits your description perfectly as long as you think building for the sake of building more is fun. Stardew Valley is a very popular and extremely well made RPG  farming simulator. Theres a lot to this game and a lot being added in. It works well for relaxing and just doing whatever you feel like doing farming exploring raising cattle dating exploring dungeon fishing conversing etc. Lots of possibilities but can still be played casually.,ShouldIbuythisgame,d4jp8e2,8,t5_2ud8h

8052373,0,t3_4pi0ty,Its not Dark Souls.  I have read people describing it as Dark Souls and Monster Hunter put together.  I havent played Monster Hunter beyond a demo once but I have played Demons Dark and Dark Souls II.  Its not Dark Souls in combat or mechanics but its actually kinda similar in overall themes.  The combat is far more forgiving theres an actual class system combat is a lot faster the upgrade system for the weapons and armor is both simplified in that theres only four tiers nonenhanced Tiers  through   and you can jump straight to  and more complex in that upgrades require exotic components which need you to have hunted down and killed increasingly rare and difficult enemies etc.That being said get it.  Its got a weird story that doesnt make a lot of sense until you finally beat the game and is mostly on the futility of fate.  The combat is interesting in how you can set up events for your pawns or have your pawns set things up for you theres parts of the game where your height and weight matter both positively and negatively and the Beloved system can accidentally leave you with cartoonish hilarity if you arent paying attention to whats going on.Its still a pretty neat game Ive not played that much like it so in that alone Its a third person action game where you use swords and spells to beat up opponents and spend portions of the game learning what your opponents even do and the maps and so on and the whole thing repeats itself  its like Dark Souls.But no not really.  Its more that theres not much else out there in that same vein so Dark Souls is the easiest comparison.But yes you should buy it.

I tried to get into both of them I put ten hours into the Witcher  and ended up fighting some boss in the swamp area then was about to set sail. Not trying to give out any spoilers so I wont say more but it just ended up getting annoying for me the game just felt like a drag I didnt know why I was playing or cared about what was happening I mean nothing happened to make me care a lot about Triss or the situation. The game says that traditionally witchers do what they will for money not much concerns them. I feel like the game wanted him to be like that but also wanted you to care about other situations but Frankly I dont give a damn about the empire I wanna be a Witcher who does what he wants makes his money and does what he wants. I stopped the Witcher  during the bloody Barons part I hate games where I always have to deal with potions and temporary stat boosts to my items.

8157037,0,t3_4qz3x0,Dragons Dogma is a great game but its more hardcore then a casual type game. It never really tells you what to do or guides you to go anywhere. The game also starts of really hard. Not Dark Souls hard but you will get crushed many times by mini boss battles that appear in the night and just bandits in general.

You cant run around killing and stealing things but you do have some leeway in shaping the pretty wellwritten story.

However I finally got into it a couple weeks ago and it really is a fun game. Couple things that helped me get into it Dont play the tutorial. Rather play a little to learn the very basics then start an actual normal campaign. The tutorial throws a bunch of randomness into your start and I found the regular start made much more sense. Also you will have to learn a few game mechanics regarding the city management research etc. This is a good guide Edit Oh yes and someone mentioned a game called Battle Brothers in a similar thread.

8197877,0,t1_d527sh3,The Borderlands series at least  and the presequel doesnt feel too openworld to me. There are a decent amount of sidequests but not too much in the way of things to explore whereas in Skyrim or Fallout youd have an incentive to look through an abandoned town for example for loot and maybe a quest or two in Borderlands youd probably head there because a quest told you to. There isnt as much character interaction for the most part characters are there to give you quests.That said I still love playing them mostly because the mechanics and gameplay are solid and there are loads of content especially in Borderlands  GOTY which I would recommend getting if you only get one and playing first. Its pretty linear unless youre doing sidequests which are fun and in no shortage as well.So TLDR It is openworld but doesnt entirely feel that way and isnt really designed in the way a Bethesda RPG is Id still recommend it if you like simpler RPG mechanics and more stimulating gunplay.,ShouldIbuythisgame,d52ad95,6,t5_2ud8h

8330394,0,t3_4to3cq,The forza series has some good customization its an Xbox exclusive now but horizon  is coming to Windows . Need for speed  has decent customization much better than most recent racing games however the games been abandoned by the devs  and is always online isnt a great game eitherThe Crew Wild Run has some decent customization as well its not as good as Id like but IMO the great map makes up for it. If you dont mind older games and are on PC need for speed underground  and most wanted are really good games for what you want. If youre on PC I recommend playing the trials for Need for Speed and The Crew Im pretty sure uplay has one and seeing whether you like them or not. Im personally waiting patiently and excitedly for Forza to come to PCFor PS your only real options are again need for speed and the crew.

8430966,0,t3_4v2lv0,A couple of suggestions on the indie  lofi PC games route which are also nicely cheap compared to mainstream gamesIMSCARED is a lofi first person horror game that breaks the Steam fourth wall a lot. I genuinely had to stop playing after going through a stressful section and then just seeing a lofi portrait of someone who I assumed would be in the next section. Nope nope nope still havent finished it.Sylvio is another first person game this time where you are a ghost hunter who uses a radio to tune in to ghostly frequencies. Recently got remastered spooky as hell.Oxenfree has been getting a lot of good press as radiotuning teenagers accidentally get in touch with some freaky forces on an island. Ive heard theres a good level of polish but maybe more of an Xfilesesque game than a true horror game.Layers of Fear is supposed to be jump scares galore are you explore a haunted mansion. Perhaps too many jump scares.Lastly Anatomy is a game by Kitty Horrorshow a truly talented weird games writer that is supposed to make you scared of your own house  .

Really anything BioWare.If you want purely story driven but more interactive I hear great things about Life is Strange or Dreamfall.

If you dont care much about combat and repetitiveness of areas you will enjoy it for the story.Dragon Age Inquisition is my favorite out of the series though more people will say Origins is better. Great story great characters good combat the only bad thing about DAI are the fetch quests but those are totally optional.

Plenty of randomness but it takes more than just that to make a good roguelikeroguelite.Games I can recommend includeGhost Master A neat older game c. that has you indirectly haunting a place with your collection of ghosts.  Worth the buck Steam wants for it but it may have issues with newer systems.  Much more funcute than dark or scary.Our Darker Purpose A topdown action game about a little girl escaping a creepy boarding school.  Kind of like The Legend of Zelda the original bit one with more restricted map and much tougher gameplay.State of Decay Xboxera zombie survival game.  Surprisingly well done.  The original game has a story and whatnot while the Breakdown DLC adds an endless game mode.  Really neat game especially considering some of the limitations of the engine they used.  I think its biggest limitation is the static map they used as in none of that fancy procedural generation.  It gets old pretty fast.  The YearOne Survival Edition is a bundle including the base game with both expansions and some touchup to prettify everything.System Shock  A survival horror classic.  It hasnt aged well but if you can handle the poor graphics and archaic UI choices its amazing especially at ..They Bleed Pixels Ridiculously hard action platformer that has you scoring bonus points by also chopping your enemies into tiny bits with awesomely bloody combos.

9481082,0,t3_5amqwo,I havent played Gears  and dont plan to so I have no opinion there. Titanfall  however is one of the best shooter campaigns Ive played in years. The only game Ive enjoyed more recently is DOOM. TiFs campaign is a whirlwind of amazing gameplay moments fantastic level design and colorful if not always completely fleshed out characters. Each level introduces a new gameplay concept that shakes things up and the levels are long enough for you to enjoy it before dropping it for the next. I wont spoil it for you but the level Effect and Cause is on par with the better parts of Portal and We Dont Go To Ravenholm. The freedom of movement makes traversing levels feel like a dream and youll be wallrunning your way into flanking positions in no time. Titan combat is a whole different animal trading your jump pack for a hulking exoskeleton capable of launching missile salvos or giant laser beams.And thats just the single player. Mutiplayer features all the same weapons and gameplay elements minus some storyspecific ones and pits you against other players in a game that manages to be casual friendly and maintain an impressively high skill ceiling.Now all that said its not without its downsides. The campaign has some pacing issues in my opinion and would benefit from a few more breather moments throughout and its not the longest game Ive ever played clocking in at around  hours possibly more depending on how difficult you find it. Multiplayer has some very minor balancing issues with some of the killstreaks and some have raised concerns over one of the mechanics that allows Pilots to deal damage to Titans though thats more of a matter of opinion.Overall Titanfall  is one of the best games Ive played this year if not one of the best games Ive played period.  ,ShouldIbuythisgame,d9hqxnw,3,t5_2ud8h

Now that thats out of the way we can start.gtthere is no Demotrail runThere is an inprogress build you can download right now to play on that includes a city to explore on the ground and a space station where you can call in your ships at a terminal and have it arrive at a landing gate basically a space airport.

9634147,0,t3_5cz039,Overwatch isnt really like CSGO its more like a blatant clone of Team Fortress . Depending on your love for team based games that rely heavily on composition and cooperation like league of legends directly correlates with how much youll enjoy Overwatch. Despite being an FPS there is less emphasis on the shooting. Theres no recoil no ammo and no amount of skill required to play this game. Being basically competent at FPS games will get you into platinum rank easily. Fun if you want to get a ton of kills in a game with minimal effort but dont want to drop  on Call of Duty.Battlefield is unlike either game as its focused on much larger maps and longer match sessions with a huge number of players. Its also based on team work but within a small squad making a small impact on the larger field. You can control vehicles like tanks and planes which is the easiest way to make a difference. Also you have to be into the WW aesthetic as guns of that era will feel janky compared to more modern shooters.Titanfall  is similar to the first game in regards to game modes weapon feel and overall mechanics. If you like the first game youll probably like the second. But depending on your feelings about the changes the following may influence your decision Titans dont have regenerating shields anymore. Batteries are required to replenish shields and you do not spawn with one. You have to rodeo enemy titans to steal batteries from them. Speaking of rodeo you cant rodeo to shoot into the backs of titans anymore. It is now a preset animation that does  a preset amount of damage. This makes rodeos more risky but at the same time reward you much more than the first game. Burn cards are gone instead you now have boosts. You can choose a boost at the start of a match ranging from turrets to map hacks to the smart pistol. The smart pistol is no longer a primary by the way. Boosts are earned once before your titan is summoned and similar to the first game you increase your titan meter by killing enemies. Bunny hopping now requires the use of sliding to maintain momentum. This makes high speed movement a bit harder to maintain but a skilled player can move as fast as a TF bunny hopper. Titans are no longer customizable loadouts but are now separated into  heroes. This ultimately makes it easier for Respawn to balance the titans.Overall I feel like Titanfall  is more fun but the other two games have higher populations. Matches are easily found in Titanfall  but expect to be stomped by veteran players until you learn the game.

There are however some good older games that will suit your needs.Morrowind was already mentioned which is a fantastic choice as was VTMBloodlines. Definitely agree with both of those. If you liked the setting of Fallout New Vegas you should check out Fallout . The gameplay is very different but setting and lorewise it should feel familiar.Planescape Torment is a classic in this genre and you have a lot of freedom to step into the character and play exactly how you want. It has a spiritual sequel in Early Access right now Torment Tides of Numenara which looks promising.In all honesty I havent played it but Ive heard great things about Jade Empire. Might be up your alley if you dont mind fantasy elements but its definitely not a traditional fantasy setting.Alpha Protocol is a bit flawed but it definitely gives you tons of options for dealing with any given scenario and makes you feel like your choices matter. Its a very different setting than you usually see in roleplaying games though its a spy thriller so it gets originality points for that.Id like to give a quick plug to the Witcher series. Now its probably not exactly what youre looking for. It is a fantasy setting and you dont get to create your character you play Geralt of Rivia and he already has a preset background and history. That said these games do a great job at giving you a multitude of choices to make and the consequences of those choices are never immediately obvious. There are very few clear goodevil options. Everything is shades of grey andor matters of practicality versus idealism.,ShouldIbuythisgame,da1tihh,11,t5_2ud8h

Im not going to judge the remastered versions since I havent played them but since the core game has stayed the same presumably Ill judge them by that...AC has some garbage combat very simple enemies take their turns to hit and you can essentially slaughter a town even before you get all the upgrades. Still the actual game going around the cities which are shockingly accurate to their realworld counterparts as I couldnt help but marvel at when I visited Venice Rome and Florence a few years ago upgrading the villa your armour etc is extremely satisfying and actually makes collecting everything fun. Arkham City is topshelf actionstealth both sections being equally fun and you  feel like the Batman. The riddler junk the collectible portion of the game is a chore and not even remotely fun.  Also exploring the city is a bit of a dreary slog since it only takes place during a night but it does have some pretty nifty landmarksareas too and zipping around with the hook more or less alleviates the shortcoming of the dreariness if you want to even fault the game for that it is Gotham after all.Theres great reasons to pick both of these up but if you want the tldr Arkham for combatBatmanness AC for exploringcollecting .,ShouldIbuythisgame,dawr8ll,2,t5_2ud8h

10111888,0,t1_dbpkrfq,Rimworld is just fun. Its like Dwarf Fortress and games like that where you issue commands and your colonists do the rest. Heres the reason its fun The game actively tries to kill you and in doing so creates an awesome story.Honestly if youre on the fence about it. Pirate it and if you enjoy it buy the game on Steam. It never goes on sale so you dont have to buy it any time soon.Here are some examples though on my last couple of play thrusI started off with  colonists and immediately find ancient technology within the first week. It wakes up and murders two colonists one was bonded with our pet dog so it went psycho and killed the remaining rd colonist. On a recent play thru I took a bunch of prisoners this time and to keep them from escaping I removed their legs and install peg legs. This makes them move slower after installing two peg legs I remove one so they only have one peg leg. I tried forcing the prisoners to starve and fight each other to the death and eat each other but they wouldnt do it. So I just leave raw human meat in their area and wait till they starve and they eventually do eat that. I harvest their eyes and lungs and release them back into their colonies because I get a Friendly buff to their faction when I release them back. I couldve sold them to slave traders but I wanted the buff and I already made money from harvesting their organs. Some of the prisoners come back with their faction and try to raid my base and since they were prisoners they remember the layout of my base which is hilarious btw cuz the exprisoners are still hobbling because of only have one peg leg. I wasnt that prepared for this raid and they ended up taking out my favorite two colonists which happened to be the only cooks in my colony. These two just got married too and I even built them their own private house. I guess I couldve found a way to survive and eat raw meat but without any cooks and winter coming plus my two favorite colonists dead I just started a new game. Next time I will probably never release the prisoners again and either just kill them to feed new prisoners or sell them as slaves if they wont recruit to my colony.Things like this happen. You start to like certain colonists and make little bonds with them even their fake pet dogs. And yes you also start to consider eating human meat to save your colonists from starving and having giant prisons and force feeding them human meat as a punishment for attacking your colony.,ShouldIbuythisgame,dbpl75p,3,t5_2ud8h

10380561,0,t1_dckljyg,Is that GTX  a GB card? That may be a problem if it is. Id say you need at least a GB GPU for this game. Either way your CPU is a major limiter here and you will be unlikely to get much more than fps. Reducing the resolution below p wont really improve your performance due to the CPU bottleneck although anything higher than that may hurt it. Its good that you have GB RAM though the majority of the issues the game had were with handling memory and anybody with less than GB typically had stuttering issues. These were improved with patches but never completely fixed. People with GB typically ran the game without that issue although it was still a very demanding game. If you upgrade your CPU you could get much better performance with your GPU although it will still be under fps at p although you may get over fps at just under x. The problem is youre running close to the best processor available for that socket so youd need to upgrade your motherboard in order to make enough of a CPU upgrade. On the intel side Id say an i  or better would be good and on the AMD side Id say an FX or better. Now this is all based on benchmarks at max settings. Obviously lower settings may help but how much is hard to say. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,dckp8lo,3,t5_2ud8h

10464079,0,t3_5pum4m,Jaws of Hakkon is basically just one additional area like Crestwood Emerald Graves or Emprise du Lion but with better main area quest than any of the areas in the core game. The story mostly offers lore about the old inquisition and Avvar.The Descent is a more linear DLC in Deep Roads with lots of combat. The story offers some lore about dwarves. The being said the areas in the Descent are some of the most beautiful caverns Ive seen in any game.Then there is Trespasser which Id say is a must get if you like the core game. It is kind of an epilogue for DAI Which in my opinion can be rather questionable to do but Im able to forgive it in this case and in my opinion it uses the best parts of the game by being story heavy in quite linear areas with some hidden stuff. I cant recall if all of the skill modifier talents introduced with the Trespasser are included also in the base game but I felt that some of those also made the combat slightly more enjoyable.,ShouldIbuythisgame,dcu7k8z,3,t5_2ud8h

10827149,0,t3_5utmnl,I love this game. The combat feels fresh and like souls when you get hit you feel like it was all on you. The World Each mission location has definitely felt different. Color palette varies as well as time of day. Very different atmospheres with different mechanics in each locale which is definitely more souls like than bloodborne.Linearity It doesnt feel too linear although it definitely is more linear than Souls. There is an emphasis on exploration in that there are items to be found and other collectibles. Items So. Many. Items. The armor is all independent. There are sets that you can acquire but you can pick individual pieces similar to soulsborne. Longevity While I do not believe there is NG system there are twilight missions which are the same missions but with higher difficulty and of course better loot drops. In regards to character customization while you cannot change his appearance you can totally change what armor he wears all the armor has different looks and the play style. The play style is totally up to the weapons you use and what stance you use them in. All in all I totally recommend it. Its challenging without feeling unfair and there is a lot of loot as well as different ways to play each mission.,ShouldIbuythisgame,ddwqsk2,2,t5_2ud8h

11252634,0,t3_60ls6b,In my opinion Battlefield  is the best game to play solo.  The maps are pretty big so you can choose how to tackle the objectives.  You can follow other players hop on a vehicle with others or lone wolf it.  You can call out commands such as need ammo thanks request order and spot enemies and vehicles.  There is plenty of room for errors  so dont worry too much about dying frequently.  The game also has a very healthy population on PS  Its the version with the most players actually.  You wont have a hard time finding a match! ,ShouldIbuythisgame,df7gwqf,9,t5_2ud8h
11258936,1,t3_60oubf,My experience with ff was really disappointing. It is absolutely beautiful and exploring the world was really fun...for like half the game. Then it gets repetitive and theres not really any reason to explore. Combat doesnt have much variation and characters are kind of annoying. Finished the game in about  hours.  I dont regret it but I wish they kept with the turn based fighting. My two cents ,ShouldIbuythisgame,df86m9u,1,t5_2ud8h

11277038,0,t3_60xeft,Ive got like  hours in and barely done anything major. Theres still so much to do. This is mainly because Im not an intense gamer so I die a lot or get distracted exploring.First thing I gotta say this game gets pretty difficult with bossesenemies. Ive beaten maybe four bosses so far and one of them took me like  tries to beat. It made me rage quit a few times honestly.Combat and game difficulty aside I recommend this game  especially for the price. Its so much fun. You can explore so much. Its not a game you can complete in  hours unless youre a wizard. The map is quite large considering how much you can dofind in each part. SPOILER the map is kinda like crazy biomes all interconnected if that makes sense. You gather skills along the way from what Ive seen so far that will help you get to places you couldnt get to previously. Its just a ton of fun that youll get a lot of hours out of. You can really sink your time in this game. I would say theres replay value for you especially if you like doing all the steam achievements. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,dfa8i3j,5,t5_2ud8h
11280561,0,t3_60ygai,I havent played steep so I cant comment on it personally but from a couple friends Ive heard its not worth paying full price for. As for MEA and Nioh I can speak. I did the  hour trial of MEA and was not impressed. If youve never played a Mass Effect game I dont think MEA is the place to start. The only thing the game really has going for it is that it is a mass effect game. If you have no attachment to the series I doubt you will get much enjoyment out of the game.Nioh on the other hand is an amazing game especially if you are a fan of the soulsborne games. The combat is more like BB but still very different. The loot system is more akin to Diablo  or Borderlands than DS or BB as you get lots of items dropping that may or may not be an upgrade. There is a lot of customization in playstyle. There are  main melee weapon types all of which have  different move sets based on which stance you are in and can be upgraded through the use of samurai points giving you new abilities and passives. There are also ninjitsu and onymo magic skills. Ninjitsu are things like kunai and bombs while onymo magic is more self buffing than casting offensive spells.The combat is very fun and fluid thanks to the ki pulse system allowing you to regain large portions of ki stamina after combos if you time the pulse right Think the reload system from gears of war. Even though the ds DLC is coming soon Nioh while similar in heart plays very differently from souls. The combat is faster paced and has a higher skill ceiling in terms of damage optimization.My recommendation is definitely with Nioh. You wont regret it.,ShouldIbuythisgame,dfamvg1,5,t5_2ud8h
11300043,0,t3_617lul,Id say if you really loved the series buy them at least for the story AC Rogue is my favorite game of the saga and then AC IV.  I know these games can be tiring AC III was hell for me and the way they got rid of the present day story was stupid but its still a very interesting story Revelations is such an awesome game!.  Also if I recall correctly they was going to be a third person protagonist for Syndicate but they couldnt complete that because of production time so they saved the protagonist for the next game. ,ShouldIbuythisgame,dfcud1o,1,t5_2ud8h

I have a gtx  with all my settings on low I got around  fps. I refunded it for now but if they fix that the game mechanics are fun from what Ive played.  is to much.

11384558,0,t3_62foat,I havent played the new version of Fairy Fencer but it is apparently a huge improvement. Id wait for a price drop and get that version as its the same story but improved gameplay and sort of an extended cut.As for Rebirth  it depends on why you dont like the CPU candidates. They get really little development in  so if you played that one first you might not like them and if you played Rebirth  first then they received absolutely zero developmentstory involvement. Both dont really help the case for the candidates but they are actually good characters in Rebirth  and VII.Because Rebirth  is noncanon Rebirth  is the actual start of the current canon timeline if you care about that sort of thing. It has a decent storyline but because of the focus on the sisters you wont see much of the main CPUs. While its not my favourite game I did like it way more than Rebirth . Theres a huge Nepgear fanbase and this game is part of the reason why. The story is more serious than the other Neptunia games so if you dont like Nepgear as a more serious protagonist and the tone of the game diverting too far away from memes you wont like Rebirth .,ShouldIbuythisgame,dfmf54u,1,t5_2ud8h

Even if you do lose if you make it to the dropship and escape it still feels like a win.

And you do not have to buy a PS Pro  game wont be updated to have PS Pro support because the studio was disbanded. Controls and handling are of acquired taste though somewhere between an arcade and a simulator.  FPS but they are the smoothest  FPS Ive ever seen P.S. Forza Horizon  is a better bang for your buck but you need Windows  and it is still horribly optimized.

At a certain point the day to day life of the colony becomes self sufficient and you can just watch them for a while though the game has been compared frequently to Dwarf Fortress so leaving them to their own devices might not be such a good idea.,ShouldIbuythisgame,dgxy16l,3,t5_2ud8h
