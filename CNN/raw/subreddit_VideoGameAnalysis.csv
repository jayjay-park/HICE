The main things he said about Tracer are The pose that was later removed compromised her character for the sake of showing off her butt which is bad because its out of character The new pose still has a weirdly prominent butt but thats more of a modeling issue than a posing one.He never said that Tracer cant be sexual.,VideoGameAnalysis,d2ugqhe,11,t5_38ieu
9149749,0,t1_d8bsbkz,I havent played No Mans Sky but I think youre spot on. It looks like a game that was redesigned so many times its like an essay rewritten sentence by sentence. Maybe individual components work maybe they dont but the greater whole is completely lost. No Mans Sky does only one thing well scale. But no one cares if they can visit  identical planets theyd much rather visit  distinct ones. The game decides to do everything  well instead of a little a whole lot better.,VideoGameAnalysis,d8bspe0,3,t5_38ieu
