The theme of Psycho Dad wanting him to get a job is getting really tired and it seems like its gotten to a point where he cant take it much farther. Pretty much all of the characters have been alienated now so hes going to run out of allies. A reboot could do the story some good.

However this was Vidcon one of the main purposes of people going is meeting up with their favorite Yotubers and being able to pick their brains.   I would bet anything the entire purpose for his trip was a chance to meet Jesse as he is clearly his favorite.    I think the people who showed up at his house uninvited or even the people who used Google maps to track down his brothers fake new house are far worse.    Imagine if you were his age and got the chance to go to a meet and greet with your favorite actor of all time.  Chances are most people here would act in a similar manor if they had the kind of access to a movie or rock star as he did with Jesse at Vidcon.   I am one of the oldest fans of his work on here with two kids myself so may have a different position as some people here.    Overall I think a lot of you are plain jealous.

Hed be forced to move back in the house and in my opinion actually I think Jesse and PD would actually bond through their depression. Everyone has left them. Theyre all they have left. Theyd find an outlet together playing video games probably Jesse would work for his Dad and eventually things would fix up between each other.Itd take losing absolutely everything for them to finally get the one thing they didnt have a genuine relationship. ,McJuggerNuggets,d7etwf5,8,t5_37r2z

10006008,0,t1_dbbiqjc,I agree. He excels as a vlogger  his cinematic shots need a lot of improvement. They almost always take me out of it.I really liked the part when Parker ended up in the house and Jesse asked how he got there. That was good timing. Im hoping these use more shots like that with Ghost Parker. ,McJuggerNuggets,dbbt8fk,2,t5_37r2z

10555704,0,t1_dd4llzm,I hope he actually clearly addresses the meaning behind this tweet sooner rather than later.

10638772,0,t3_5rk853,In all fairness January and February are slower months. If he can blur the lines of reality like he did with the docyoutuber series or the collab series he do pretty well with views. ,McJuggerNuggets,dddb3au,1,t5_37r2z
10718943,0,t3_5t8nr0,Hes made it obvious that he doesnt like doing daily uploads because it makes the content shittier. I think he badly wants to take more time to write his series before doing them. ,McJuggerNuggets,ddlkvgy,1,t5_37r2z

10827527,0,t1_ddwgaa3,Maybe he thought so. Maybe the cut was done. Their finale to the doc series was in s color correction studio. Theres a lot to be done. Score sound graphics trailer and marketing distro negotiators etc. it takes years typically. ,McJuggerNuggets,ddws70q,1,t5_37r2z

11090401,0,t3_5yd5pr,He died. If he survived it ruins it. Jesse must live with the fact that he killed his father. It has to be an everlasting consequence on everyone not just Jesse.Jesse destroyed everything he loved to escape. If PD was alive one day down the road his family may be able to forgive him. But now?Now Jesse has nothing but himself. Thats the beauty of it in my opinion.,McJuggerNuggets,dep35o0,3,t5_37r2z

11796254,0,t1_dgx3kli,What should we can him then? Lmao I think were currently seeing a darker side not particularly evil of Jesse at the moment so maybe Dark Jesse? But then again just in the last video Dark Jesse tried to drown himself and the body of regular Jesse and without any interference from Uncle Larry he would have killed the both of them and all the characters we saw at the beginning of the  Seriesthe Snapper Series. So would that be a sign that Evil Jesse is still evil? Not to mention ruining the regular Jesses body and liver with an excessive amount of alcohol and his mind with terrible decisions.
