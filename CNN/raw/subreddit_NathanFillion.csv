7588522,0,t3_4j5myv,Id be really interested to hear how much this had to do with the actors having a problem with Stana not coming back as apposed to the fans. I mean obviously not bring back the most important character in the show other than Nathan just to try and change the direction of the show is incredibly stupid. No idea how anyone at the studio thought that would be a good idea.,NathanFillion,d34s0es,1,t5_2sasy
