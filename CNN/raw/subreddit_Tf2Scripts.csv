2236859,0,t3_2krxh5,So I thought it would be although it would require the wait command and would only partially work on servers with wait disabled however it turns out that you cant alias tauntbyname it has to be bound directly so it looks like this one isnt possible,Tf2Scripts,clo5pqe,2,t5_2tm8z
2330909,0,t1_clzt8ug,Yeah that sets it when you run it the first time. If you want it to be set to cJump when you run it the first time replace it with cJump and swap the rJump and cJump on lines  and .,Tf2Scripts,clztajj,1,t5_2tm8z
2421636,0,t1_cmazax2,You will need to make a .cfg file crosshairdefault.cfg and put this in it    clcrosshairfile Try that as a reminder L should hide primary viewmodel but show secondary and melee. Hopefully thats what you were expecting to happen.By default the above script shows all viewmodels.

3107431,0,t1_cok0e9b,Hey Ive been playing TF the past  hours and Ive noticed a small problem and that is that when Im choosing a taunt or holding a building as engineer I cant cancel out. It says hit ltnot boundgt to cancel. I changed the ingame settings back to allow me to cancel but the script doesnt work anymore when pressing Q to cycle between the first  weapons. Is there an easy fix for this? If not dont worry about it too much since I can just bind F or another key that I never use to cancel out and all will be okay.,Tf2Scripts,cok31h7,1,t5_2tm8z

5957849,0,t3_3x1112,Does binding a different key directly to reload  not work? TF requires direct and exclusive unaliased binding for a lot of their implicit functions so I wouldnt be surprised if doing anything other than bind key reload failed to activate focus.,Tf2Scripts,cy0lsa4,3,t5_2tm8z

6529154,0,t3_44xl6z,If I recall correctly and keep in mind that I tried and failed you need to edit the qc ?? file and recompile it.I really dont know anything about this and like I said I failed when I tried to edit the animations. I tried recompiling and all that but it would never change or it would change back.This is also isnt scripting its more like modding and I wouldnt bet on a lot of us knowing much about it.,Tf2Scripts,czunzss,2,t5_2tm8z
