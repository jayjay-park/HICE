8174,0,t3_1u77s5,Mark of the Ninja and Valdis Story Abyss City. Both are pretty amazing games and I love the platforming elements in both of them. One is a stealth platformer while the other is an action platformer.Mark of the ninja has great stealth combat and really well done level design. You can play the game stealthily or go in gungho like a samurai. Not only that a decent story with NINJAS!Valdis Story is another great one I love how interactive the devs are with their fanbase. Theyre actively communicating with them and taking feedback to improve their game. I even got a free copy of the game during their live streaming session. Not only that the combat is pretty complex and in depth while allowing for replayability.,gamingsuggestions,cefd7sl,3,t5_2sxyv

22279,0,t3_1udiv2,Tales of Vesperia Xbox  is my favorite in recent memory. The combat is real time rather than turn based so that may work for you. Its not as open as something like Skyrim though. Youll have to progress the story to open up certain areas of the game. There is a lot of optional content to keep you busy though. There are some optional bosses throughout the game that you can track down for example but theyre not superoverpowered so they dont require tons of grinding to defeat. I enjoyed the story but then again I like JRPGs in the first place. ,gamingsuggestions,cegyxbz,8,t5_2sxyv

296715,0,t1_cfbiqpb,ampampamp X gtgtX games are a genre of strategybased video and board games in which players control an empire and eXplore eXpand eXploit and eXterminate. The term was first coined by Alan Emrich in his September  preview of Master of Orion for Computer Gaming World. Since then others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and designgtX games are noted for their deep complex gameplay Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development as well as a range of nonmilitary routes to supremacy. Games can take a long time to complete since the amount of micromanagement needed to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows. X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious for these reasons and several games have attempted to address these concerns by limiting micromanagement with varying degrees of success.gtThe earliest X games borrowed ideas from board games and s textbased computer games. The first X games were turnbased but realtime X games are not uncommon. Many X games were published in the mids but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier Civilization is an important example from this formative era and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium several X releases have become critically and commercially successful.gtgtImage from article iInteresting CDROM | Ploidy | Fourcross udanhm can reply with delete.

337323,0,t3_1xyef9,For PS Id highly recommend both Persona  and Persona . I also loved all of the SMT games on the DS. If you like turn based strategy then you should look into Devil Survivor which also had a sequel I havent played. Shin Megami Tensei Strange Journey also for the DS was also good but it had a lot of exploration and a ton of text to read which some people dont care for. It also had multiple endings based on the decisions you make throughout the game.Basically Ive never played an SMT game that I didnt like. Even the old NESSNES games were really good. If you dont mind the social simulation aspect Id recommend Persona  or  as a starting point. Basically theres lots of traditional JRPG combat although both games are harder than average but theres also some life simulation aspects. You go to school join clubs meethang out with friends and the stuff you do in your normal life will impact your stats or otherwise provide bonuses when you start fighting demons.I personally preferred Persona  but I feel like more people liked Persona  better. Theyre different stories with different characters so you dont have to worry about missing anything by picking up either of those games without playing the earlier titles. Id suggest checking out some gameplay videos on Youtube to see which charactersstory interests you more.,gamingsuggestions,cffqff6,2,t5_2sxyv

The story is written by fantasy novel author R.A. Salvatore. While it appears as yet another You Are The Chosen One at first its slowly revealed to be a bit more than that and the game plays with players expectations a lot. With the game being nonlinear and very explorationbased there is also a lot of content off the beaten path with different factions and tons of sidequests and none are kill  rats type quests. The character creator is solid with  different races male and female characters and lots of facial featureshairstyles to choose from.The art style is unique and very pretty. There are five very colorful regions to explore each with several zones and its own feel. On the small scale the character design is slightly comicy with exaggerated features and some ridiculouslysized weapons.You level up your character in the traditional way gathering XP but on level up you can decide in which of the three specializations Warrior Rogue Mage and which abilities to invest. Designing your own hybrid class is possible and encouraged by the game.

977542,0,t3_25ab1y,Miasmata is the best exploration game Ive played.Youre sick and land on an island to try and find a cure. The island itself is full of landmarks and you start with a map with a tiny portion of the island marked on it and you have to find positions where you can see two landmarks that you know the location of already to add where youre standing to the map its incredibly unique and because of it I spent half my time in the game quite literally lost running around a jungle for hours trying to find places that I had been before.. that might sound like it sucks but it didnt.Theres no time limit on the game regardless of being sick just adding that so you dont feel like you have to rush the game at all. Though you can die through other things like falling etc but it saves every time you sleep which will be often.Theres a mystery storyline to discover from exploring the island and the game is absolutely dripping in tension and atmosphere.One of the most unique and best games Ive played. I dont think it would appeal to everyone but I think it would appeal to anyone that likes the idea of exploration.,gamingsuggestions,chfelch,3,t5_2sxyv

They started as a GTA impersonator but eventually evolved into an over the top fun and crazy series that I love dearly. Although I never played the online for those so I couldnt tell you how that is.also has coopDead Rising and Dead Rising  are some fun but different games! The story line is campy and weird but I really enjoyed those games.The Darkness  is a fun fps with a pretty interesting story.Just Cause  is a ridiculously fun third person action game with a completely forgettable story that really just functions as an excuse for you to blow things up. The grappling hook and parachute are really what make the game awesome!Max Payne  is a wonderful third person shooter with an excellent storyline! It is a lot of fun and no previous knowledge of the Max Payne series is required.GTA IV I liked it better than GTAV personally!Spec Ops The Line was a rather standard third person shooter with a pretty cool story line!The Darksiders games are pretty cool as well.

1661049,0,t3_2dd3ux,You didnt really give a good idea of what genres youre looking for so Im assuming any? Knowing that you like firstperson games I made a few guessesDo you like puzzle games? There are quite a few firstperson puzzle games that are really good like Portal  Q.U.B.E. etc. If youre worried that the execution of the solutions might be too hard then try Antichamber theres absolutely no difficulty to completing the puzzles once you know the solution but solving the puzzles might bend your brain in two.Mirrors Edge also kind of counts as a puzzle game since theres a lot of platforming and such. Gets a bit tricky near the end though I dont recall if theres a difficulty setting.If you want something with a lot of humor Octodad and Octodad Dadliest Catch are really great. Not too hard and failing is often more humorous than aggravating. And if you like walking simulators i.e. Dear EstherGone Home you might like The Stanley Parable its got a good sense of humor and theres no real way to fail as the game is basically a series of choices.Also probably worth mentioning Minecraft if you dont have it already.

Koa was like Fable meets Skyrim lots to do but each thing doesnt have a lot of depth the combat is pretty fun. Witcher  is more technical gameplay more involved story more depth to the RPG less open. Id say DEHR is a middle ground as far as depth vs fun gamrplay but with guns instead of magic.,gamingsuggestions,cju00b4,1,t5_2sxyv

1865846,0,t3_2fhq92,Here are my recommendations for characterstoryfocused gamesFor the systems you mentioned owning Mass Effect Series Especially if you play as a female character the voice actress was much better in my opinion the characters are phenomenal. The Walking Dead The Telltale games series is all about character interaction and their characters might be the best Ive ever seen. Final Fantasy X Solid cast though Tidus can get a bit whiny and a fun return to a truly turnbased RPG from the FF series. ICO Never has a lacking in dialogue created such beautiful characters. Shadow of the Colossus Perhaps my favorite game of all time. The same developer as ICO. This game turned my world upsidedown as far as what a video game could be. There isnt much dialogue but that in no way inhibits your caring for Wander.If you find yourself owning a PS check out Catherine Heavy Rain The Last of Us Ive never cared about characters more...maybe The Walking Dead...maybe... The Uncharted series has FANTASTIC characters and are just really fun to play and beautiful to look at.,gamingsuggestions,cke11qe,2,t5_2sxyv

And below is a link to a great youtube series that features actual mods for RPG games like Skyrim. Both entertaining and great way to get a glimpse of what modding can do for RPG gaming experience.

1981721,0,t1_ckrzw3q,OP asks for flashy combat. To me  has the flashiest combat system hands down and its a good enough conclusion to the series.

Personally I believe Squareenix butchered the FF by doing a  part series. Id love the combat from  the freedom from  the cast of  and  and a balanced story with  .  FF has so much potential.

1987527,0,t3_2hh5fo,Mount amp Blade Warband may be to your liking especially with the Diplomacy mod which is very easy to find and install. Its kind of a unique sandbox RPGstrategy hybrid in a medieval lowfantasy setting fictional world but no fantastical elements like magic or monsters just men blood and steel.It has combat excellent combat actually trade diplomacy intrigue. You can join any faction or none. You can be a mercenary a trader a bandit a lord or even a king  if you work for it. Its partly an RPG in that you have a character that has skills levels up you acquire equipment etc you can also recruit NPCs of that same type. Then theres your warband soldiers that you recruit which can also be leveledupgraded though in a more simple way you can have over a hundred of these soldiers to lead into strdperson battles with other such parties. With the battlesizer mod you can increase the limit on the number of soldiers in a battle from  to  though youll need a powerful computer to actually play such a large battle.Possible cons There isnt really a story just a sandbox world the story is just whatever you do and your interactions with other characters. Theres not exactly exploration as the world isnt concealed by fogofwar at the start but there are lots of different locations to see. Finally multiplayer is limited to just the combat part not the sandbox part. The graphics are a little dated but not bad.Overall its a fantastic game Ive put over  hours into it  and thats over only two and a half full playthroughs. Theres a lot to do a lot of land to conquer a lot of enemies to slay a lot of wealth and gear to acquire. Its also pretty unique its not going to really be like other things youve played. Theres nothing quite like blasting some Two Steps From Hell while leading a charge of a hundred heavy cavalry to break through the lines of a strong army of swordsmen and slaughtering them as they scatter and flee before your might.,gamingsuggestions,cksp4l4,3,t5_2sxyv

If that sounds up your alley KarateChopsticks on YouTube has done an excellent Lets Play of the game so you can get an idea of what its like.If thats not quite your cup of tea you could try obsCure and Fatal Frame instead the first revolves around a mysterious plant that causes disturbing changes in people and the second involves dark rituals angry spirits and a mysterious camera called the Camera Obscura which is the only way to do battle with said spirits.Theres another thats on the tip of my tongue but I cant remember its name offhand I do remember that it involved four separate ancient and Cthulhuesque entities each battling the others and using one particular family as their proxies.EDIT Found the last one!

Only downsides are costsystem requirements Battlefield  or Hardline Everything you want plus cars and etc. You have to put yourself out there though to find other people to play with Interstellar Marines Still in early access and not a lot of content wouldnt really recommend unless you absolutely love shooters but its a twitch shooter that is pretty fun singleplayer not much going for online though Natural Selection  Community is dying but Ive had a lot of fun with and without friends in this game Evolve Might of already said it it is kinda pricey and the devs already talking about a shit ton of dlc but the game seems like something that would fit you well Dying Light Really need a few friends not the kind of game you get random people but it is fun with and without friendsHope this helps and goodluck finding a suitable game.

There are lots of different systems to jump to with hundreds of bases in total. Ingame events effect the economy of the different bases like pirate invasions etc... increasing good costs and you can make a living trading. Combat is fast paced and based on your capital ship broadsiding other capital ships and their fighter escorts so it feels very pirate like. Unlike pirates there is no capturing ships or taking portsbases and their is no crew management.Starpoint Gemini is similar in many ways but I found the combat to be less enjoyable. Starpoint does let you capture enemy ships though not sure on bases and has very rudimentary crew management through picking officers with various bonuses.,gamingsuggestions,cybgnh0,2,t5_2sxyv

7258916,0,t3_4esonk,One thing I discovered is that a TON of PC games offer different filters to help visually impaired people mostly for colorblindness but the tech is getting better each day!Ive found that people with these sort of deficits really enjoy strategy games as theyre turn by turn basis gives them the opportunity to stew over whats on the screen and its usually text and numbers so theres less need for map awareness. So perhaps a good x game like Civilization or Endless Legend might be worth looking into.While its a little more intensive Divinity Original Sin offers what I consider the best coop experience as of late due to the fact that combat is turnbased and offers a lot of options on how to approach each battle so it becomes more of a dissection between the two players rather than a run and gun sort of feel.

I finished it and enjoyed the digimon but cant really recommend as a digimon game. You can easily spend over an hour without a battle just walking around watching where will the silly visual novel detective story take you. By chapter  out of  you are just begging for the game to give you a break so you can grind levels to digievolve the digimon into the ones you want but the places to focus on your party are very rare. But the silly linear visual novel will guide you through yet another scene.Oh and as a story focused game the story makes absolutely no sense. The real world and the Internet are becoming one the invisible wall is just people who wont get out of your way despite your digimon being x stronger but who cares they need a plot reason to do so. And the protagonist has the power to enter the digital world behind even things like air conditioner. Ugh and there is a whole conspiracy involving digital waves and people on coma that is simply bad. It is like everyone went dumb so the story has to work.On a smaller note the unvoiced protagonist and the way they portray woman makes me sickGod why did I pay fucking full price for this crap. To sum up just wait for the next digimon game New Order or something for a complete digimon world ps experience.,gamingsuggestions,d2ozhz9,3,t5_2sxyv

Its more of a small squadron game than a fleet game or a fighter game.If you do try it protip ignore the achievements until you have beaten the game.

7728498,0,t3_4l4eka,As someone else mentioned Civ isnt a grand strategy its a X game. If youre looking for a turn based grand strategy Im not sure any exist. If youre looking for more X then theres plenty of options.My favorite turn based Xs besides civ of course are Endless Legend and Galactic Civilizations III. Endless legend is quite similar to Civ however the combat is much different each racenation has completely different units and when you engage an enemy and turn based tactic style fight unfolds with you commanding it. Theres also an extensive quest system that serves as another victory types in addition to the ones youre probably used to.Gal Civ III is more of the same again except its scifi instead of colonizing new lands you colonize new planets. It has an interesting technology system that is tied to different time periods set on the galactic stage. For example you cant even declare war in Gal Civ III until the age of war. I would recommend Stellaris instead of Gal Civ because I think it is better in every way however Stellaris is real time and thats not what you asked for.,gamingsuggestions,d3kobzg,3,t5_2sxyv

The factions are all very different and each cater to certain playstyles while remaining really well balanced. The campaign is a bit different then the rest of the series theres less internal management but more diplomatic options.

8066381,0,t1_d4mkdzq,gtMapsFirst off a general observation There are certainly some levels where you couldve and shouldve had one big map Fight Night for example where you can beat up Sanchez in the ring. In other missions it wouldnt add anything Blackwater ParkgtNow here is where I start to disagree. Blood Money and the new Hitman maps are open free multiple NPCs and the whole hit having to go smoothly for a perfect score. The short linear map segments in Blood Money though fun and good for story flow hurt the gameplay majorly.Well you can still play like this and you probably will. If you want a perfect assassination you want the best rating on both parts of the map. But I get what you mean you dont need to. gtSure you could still approach in somewhat different ways but you had less options overall and it meant you had no reason to try to be perfect and silent because once you went past the checkpoint you had no worries. For instance in the Hotel level you could leave dead naked bodies everywhere and make tons of noise as long as you got to the elevator the people up stairs would never know about it.Well this is a flawed point of view imho. Hitman is supposed to be played in stealthy manner either no one sees you or you manage to kill the witness quick enough so the guards arent alerted. The developers were just nice enough to give you the opportunity to kill everyone  otherwise  would die a lot quicker on Normal or Hard. But this is not gtFreedomgtAgain Blood Money was perfect in this regard. On average you had at least a half dozen ways to kill someone and all of them were unique. Drop wine crates on someone poison a rehab patients hidden booze swap a prop pistol with a real C mauser.In Absolution I cant remember more than a handful of signature kills. Maybe I just missed a ton because I wasnt a huge fan of the game and it just never felt worth trying so I will admit this could be totally wrong.I think we had a similar first playthrough. I played it years ago and only finished my second playthrough two weeks ago and I discovered that I had missed a lot of ways to kill targets which are impossible to miss if you look at the challenges or simply use instinct. That doesnt mean youre completely wrong since there are a few maps where you dont have these kind of options. And there are also levels where you dont kill anyone so naturally they dont offer as much variety even if you can get through the level in numerous ways different disguises. Examples for unique killsAbsolutionFight Night Killed by light rig killed by fighting Sanchez in the ring killed by sniping but everyone thinks his opponent knocked him outBlackwater Park Whaling harpoon crushed by whale skeleton poisoned sushi snipe target off the roof only kinda unique death by making the fireplace explode although this was better done in this one mission in Contracts fiber wire or katana in samurai disguise!Blood MoneyCurtains Down combined options for two not one target Sniping Light rig chandelier switched fake gun fiber wire in dressing roomVintage Year again  targets Fiber wire push off the balcony wine barrelsI know those are only two example I think A New Life in BM didnt offer many ways to kill the target but a lot ways to get the microfilm but I just wanted to show you that Absolution offers some choices. I think this wrong impression comes mostly from the smaller maps. gtAILike you I dont really notice. That said in Blood Money the levels felt more alive. Absolution just seemed like models standing around to give the impression of a location never moving outside set paths or doing interesting things.Mh didnt notice that. The crowds in Absolution were a lot better though you had to actually push through them. And I think in both games NPCs were standing around a lot. gtSemi unpredictable NPCs are what I would prefer. Sure security and the target should have a schedule but I think it should be able to be interrupted. Maybe on the way to the bathroom the target stops to chat and maybe the guard on his tail might get distracted by a hot woman or other man  dont judge and lose track of him for a second. It would make levels organic rather than having a perfect solution.Sounds nice but could become tedious if you want to kill the target. Maybe the guardtarget gets distracted and throws off your whole plan. This would only work for me if you were planning your kills beforehand i.e. the briefing shows you whats possible and you lay out your plan A B and C. This of course would mean you dont have to explore levels like you have to do in every Hitman game. gtI do miss choosing my loadout but that being said I rarely ever strayed from Silverballers and a backup Raging Bull combo so I didnt miss it too much.Well after beating the game there were some levels which were fun to beat by killing everyone. And with an assault rifle its even more fun than with the Silverballers. Unless you try to kill as many people undetected as possible this was a cool little challenge as well. gt I never used Contracts because it seemed like a missed opportunity where you had to unlock weapons and outfits with points instead of just collecting them in game like in Blood Money and it bugged me.Aside from  weapons you can find every weapon in game. But I havent really tried Contracts as well. Anyway its nice to have a civilized discussion about this!,gamingsuggestions,d4mqk6e,2,t5_2sxyv

8600758,0,t3_4xk9wv,Im going to try and clear up and explain some stuff thats been saidThe games are generally divided up into different generations and with different versions of practically the same game. The different versions of first gen is Red and Blue which got released together and Yellow which got released later. Each version is practically the same game but with some exclusive Pokemon that cant be caught in the other so it relies on trading with other people to truly catch em all. Each generation takes place in a new region adds new features and tweaks alongside a bunch of new Pokemon to catch. To further confuse it theyve also added third versions for each generation until gen  this third version has a mix of catchable Pokemon from the other  versions alongside general improvements so in Pokemon Crystal gen  it lets you choose your gender and also has animated Pokemon sprites along with a bunch of other improvements compared to Gold and Silver.Alongside all that starting with gen  theyve started releasing remakes of the previous games. FireRed and LeafGreen because Blue was called Green in Japan are remakes of Red and Blue respectively for the Gameboy Advance which still fall in to gen  as they keep the new Pokemon and features up to that generation. Because each game also takes place in a different region it also restricts what Pokemon you can catch so for example in gen  you cant catch most if any of the Pokemon from the previous two generations.Thankfully Pokemon also has a pretty big romhacking scene so there are romhacks for every generation even up to the current DS games. This means if you really want to you can get a romhack for whatever game you choose and have EVERY Pokemon catchable without need to trade not even for Pokemon that ONLY evolve from trading of course this kind of deviates from what the game designers planned especially Pokemon that shouldnt be in a region it isnt in but these romhacks also balance the trainer fights to match.TLDR You want to use a romhack if you really want to Catch em All and dont mind what the designers desired.With that out of the way..Pokemon FireRedLeafGreen are good as they are GBA remakes of the originals giving you the classic game with decent graphics and can be emulated on pretty much anything nowadays.Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver are DS remakes of the second generation usually considered the best and has a bunch of cool features including letting you explore Kanto the region from first gen. DS emulation is pretty good nowadays so you shouldnt have a problem with it if you have a Android device I would personally recommend DraStic as it is arguably the best DS emulator if youre willing to pay.DS emulation is still in the works so you should only check out the recent games if you actually have a DS.,gamingsuggestions,d6gos4m,3,t5_2sxyv

Then sprinkle in combat from Devil May Cry with Prince of Persia movement in the sequel.Dark Souls and its sequels might also fit what youre looking for. However they dont spell the objective out for you. Youre meant to discover things for yourself.

Good amount of content with the base game and you can run several different racing series that cater to limited purchases. Bulk order discounts on content mean that spending  every couple of months gives you extra free content. For about  a year you can race everything with a bit of strategy. If you are a racing fan the online play is literally comparable to nothing the best multiplayer racing experience currently available. Its also way cheaper than racing in real life at least k a year so take that into consideration when buying the game. A racing wheel and triple monitors are pretty much a requirement for the higher level competitive play so dont forget to budget the extra  eventually into that but racing on a single monitor and with a controller will get you hooked anyways.,gamingsuggestions,d9o7pwd,1,t5_2sxyv

Europa Universalis  that simulates the Reinassaince and the early modern period Victoria  that simulates the th and beginning of the th century Hearts of Iron  That simulates WW period.If you like the civilization style of game but want also a bit of fantasy in it you can try Fallen Enchantress.

10462960,0,t3_5pv0q2,Have you already seen this and this from the FF sub sidebar?ampnbspAnyways to answer you The GBA is the best imo.  It adds an extra dungeon.  The only reason its not good is because the sound sucks...but that can be patched.  And yes either way youre gonna have to emu it.  I say go for it.  Its the best of the classic FFs. Personally if you want to play a linear first one go for XX.  Nothing wrong with XIII unless youre turned off by the less turnbased battle system. The art style is subjective.  I would look past it as IX is a really good throwback to classic FFs.  I would chalk the cartoony style to its storybook presentation but make no mistake there are some dark moments in this game and probably one of the most sympathetic of the FF villains. I hear Steam aint so bad and is recommended tbh since the alternatives are shit unless you have a PS and dont mind long battle animations which were all the rage back then.  Dont know if its out yet though.  s Battle System is...ok.  I dont particularly like the Drawing mechanic but its not the most terrible thing.  It also has timed hits if you like those.  If you dont it could get annoying.  And personally the story is really hard to love certain events feel so contrived and time travel is involved.   is a safer choice if youre choosing between the .ampnbspMy personal recommendation is  or  for overall but  if you prefer a modern setting.  If its youre first time playing a JRPG go for X.  I personally wouldnt call X the best but it certainly is the simplest oh and the voice acting sucks first game to have one so I cut them some slack.

10714756,0,t3_5t96cd,Morrowind with Tamriel Rebuilt is probably the most content filled deep rpg I know of. So much content you have to see it to believe it. Flying? Check. Massive cities with hundreds of houses and inhabitants? Check. Thousands of secrets? Check. Varied environments? Check. Fight gods? Check. Become a god? Check. Most importantly non typical western rpg lore? Check times a billion. I have never been so immersed in a game. Its a living breathing world. Places actually feel lived in and not just copy pasted set pieces. So much shit to do its mind boggling. Unfortunately not as popular as later Elder Scrolls games because there is way more focus on reading. Also its super easy to get lost because you have to use a map and ask for directions. I see these as enhancements. Oh yeah combat uses a dice roll system so dont freak out if you miss a lot in the beginning. Just train train train those skills. ,gamingsuggestions,ddl5b9z,5,t5_2sxyv
10724816,0,t3_5ter9o,I feel the sense of discovery in almost every games. I guess my bar is set pretty low...Anyway heres a few  but I think it may not match what youd expect. Starbound For the first playthrough only. Pretty short but also decently cheap. Its core gameplay is survivalbuilding similar to Minecraft or Terraria so if you dont like them stay away. EDIT if you are going to play this one dont start building a house after the tutorial part. Find a mining shaft get  planetary cores from the chest and follow the main quest. TES Morrowind Oblivion Skyrim For settlements Morrowind is the best while Skyrim and Oblivion are about the same. Settlements of Morrowind are really alien and strange unlike those in Oblivion and Skyrim. For dungeons Skyrim is the best Oblivion is okay and Morrowind is meh. Choose one you want. Mass Effect  Mako is fun Stellaris Its a strategic game or specifically an X game. Similar to Civ series but in space. You will discover different alien species legacy of ancient civs and more. There are some nasty surprises too. p Dishonored  The world setting is solid in those games. The world itself doesnt change a lot because it happens all in one city but discovering the world from books dialogues and other events are pretty fun. Its also a very good stealthaction game. Stealth gameplay is not hard to begin with but you can just go full action too. Dark Souls  If you havent and want to feel the sense of discovery this is a MUST PLAY. Its notorious for its difficulty and if you are weak at action games you may want to seek help from rdarksouls. They will be glad to help you out. Bloodborne Similar to Dark Souls but gothic Victorian setting. Difficult too and can be very scary in latter part. Be careful. Again if too hard seek help from rbloodborne. If you are into MMOs try Guild Wars  Final Fantasy XIV or The Elder Scrolls Online.,gamingsuggestions,ddm6o6d,2,t5_2sxyv

10868482,0,t3_5vbtdz,I have played all three and heres my two cents. Dragon Age Origins. I have spent the most time in this game and is the easiest to get into when coming from games like skyrim and fallout. The easy mode is actually easy and if you are not great at games like me you can go through most of the game without needing to optimising your party. Also your party members are great and the story is larger than life akin to lord of the rings. The origins are a great touch and really get you into character. There are some parts of the game that drag on a bit example the fade. but overall I enjoy the pacing even after playing the game several times and there are mods that specifically address these issues but Ive never tried them . Finally its the cheapest of the three is on sale often and has two sequels in which your progress carries on. The graphics have not aged great so that might be an issue for some folk. I fully recommend this game. Divinity original sin. RPG veterans praise this game more than both DAO and PoE. Even early on you can see all the synergy available in the game and may be able to do some impressive combos from the get go. The game feels like its built to be played in coop mode and my first couple of hours I didnt have automatic dialogue for the second character and hated roleplaying two characters. If that is your thing though none of the other options offer this feature. You can only play human though which was a bummer for me big fan of dwarves. My biggest issue with the game was the difficulty that many people like. Game has a sequel in early access so you can get more of the same. I recommend this game if you are comfortable with being challenged. Pillars of Eternity. I really wanted to like this game but the game has a lot of things that make me dislike it. In the beginning you get a cool power that you can read peoples souls. Its so exciting in the beginning that almost every character has a backstory that you can read but then I realised it was written by people who backed the kickstarter and the writing ranges from ok to abysmal. The game mechanics work but are not fun. You have to go towards builds that are viable or you end up dying a lot. IIRC tanks in front and gunners behind but its been a while. and the characters in your party arent that great. Few are interesting like the fire priest but the rest fall short and the eskimo is just plain boring. The writing is all over the place like many games written by Obsidian and this game has some of their weakest works. I generally love the games they put out and hope for the best for them specially after how they got treated by Bethesda but this game from my opinion is not worth it. I am glad their new game is getting praised and once I have the time I plan on buying it but I recommend against Pillars of Eternity. ,gamingsuggestions,de1091c,1,t5_2sxyv

Now I will offer some notsoknown ones Sylvio has you playing as an actual ghost hunter using an EVP device to try and look for spirits in an abandoned park. Dont Chat With Strangers has you chatting with a woman online.   Guesses as to what happens next. Dead Secret has you escaping an unknown killer while trying to solve a mystery inside a house.  The game is played like a ptclick adventure game. This Book is a Dungeon is actually more of a text adventure but something like a choose your own adventure with ALOT of gruesome deaths in it. Calendula is one of those mindfuck gamesthe moment you start the game up youre already playing it!  Expect alot of interface fuckery and unintended glitches as you try and make sense of the game within the game. Pony Island also plays like Calendula but in the guise of a seemingly innocent Pony jumping game.  The horror is also downplayed here mostly focusing on the interesting situation you are put in.  Just thought I should mention it too. The Coma Cutting Class is about you exploring your school and trying to escape from your favorite teacher who wants to kill you.  Special attention is brought to the tension of being huntedthe subtle sounds that you encounter on a quiet hallway for example. We Know the Devil and Oxenfree arent horror games per se but they both have similar themes Friendship simulators in the backdrop of a supernatural event.

Right now gaming seems to be your only escape but maybe you can hit two birds with a single shot doing something that helps you out with your depression and your health. Maybe you can even meet some new people. If you have access to any kind of studying group or tutoring in school you could join those to it will basically give you some structure.Finally I know how you feel I have been there and even though sometimes you feel like you cant do anything and you cant face depression the easiest way to do it is simply by doing stuff. It might sound stupid but all you need to do is take the first step. If you are worried about your grades just make the effort to study a little bit you will see your grades go up just a little bit and those small achievements are what are going to encourage you to go on. The same is true for working out if you like running just do it the first time you might not be able to run a single mile but every day you will be able to run just a little more and those extra yards are what will encourage you to keep running.These are simply things that helped me out when I was in a situation like you I to was spending to much time with my computer and letting the other aspects of my life sink while being to afraid to visit a doctor. My way to get out was by acquiring some structure not letting myself use the PC more than  hours a day training twice a week and studying a certain ammount of hours a day and not letting myself miss classes,gamingsuggestions,deh28y9,1,t5_2sxyv

11352816,0,t1_dfita1v,Hey I totally agree about the console point. Ive only been on console for this last generation since my childhood so I will say this Other console games you might like are Bloodborne The Last of Us and Infamous. All of these have characters in unique settings. Still though it is a hard purchase to justify. Im glad youre going to check out Lisa it became one of my favorites the year I played it despite its scrappy presentation. If you get around to playing it be sure to let us know how it went!,gamingsuggestions,dfitjyv,2,t5_2sxyv
11371024,0,t3_629vys,gtDoes this really even exist?Highly doubt it. Games are as you already mentioned mainly a power fantasy. Their task is to make the player feel cool powerful and badass not helpless and constantly at the mercy of others.The closest thing I can think of to what you want would be Clock Tower on the SNES and Haunting Grounds on the PS. In both of those games youre a girl who is literally defenseless and constantly on the run from a superpowered serial killer. It doesnt fit your vision completely though because its not about getting rescued by someone but rather the player triumphing over them despite being weak and helpless. Still its probably the closest youre gonna get so take it as you will.,gamingsuggestions,dfkvudl,5,t5_2sxyv

11491788,0,t3_640mee,So got a nice variety of games for the selection. Ill help break them down for you.I. Yooka Laylee This is just a modern d platformer collect a thon. If youre nostaglic for Banjo Kazooie or Spyro and dont care about some antiquated design choices then its worth a pick up.II. Sniper Elite  WW Shooter focused on Sniping If youre a big fan of sniping in games like Battlefield but wish you had a whole single player game built around the concept then you should get itIII. Nier Automata Its hard to describe Nier. Just imagine an Action RPG that is built how most Platinum games are built conceived in a world that is just as wacky as the creator.IV. DOOM Its s DOOM that you remember that has been brought up to the modern era. The story is simple. Scientists start experimenting with some crazy demonic tech. They accidentally start Hells Invasion and now you The Doom Guy need to fix this mess the only way you know how. Murder everything.Imho I would go for Nier because while DOOM is great. It doesnt offer much in terms of replaybility and you can burn through the game in about  hours. Nier is actually built to have multiple playthroughs to get separate endings and explore places you missed.,gamingsuggestions,dfylcyo,2,t5_2sxyv
