7069469,0,t3_4cfnet,gtThis week has primarily been a continuation of the work started last week consisting of bug fixes concept art for our new ships and rough mockup meshes for the new ships. Weve also been spending a lot of time this last week going back over all of our materials to make sure that they have proper brightness and contrast.Hauleralmostready.jpgx . MBgtPart of the reason Infinity Battlescape looks so good is that its using a technique called Physically Based Rendering PBR. This means that we do a lot of fancy math stuff to ensure that our simulation adheres to the real world laws of physics such as the law of conservation of energy which results in a more photorealistic looking game. This changes the way our artists have to think about creating materials relative to how they have traditionally produced game assets and so we reviewed everything to make sure that our art is cohesive and to ensure everybody is building assets the best way possible.TurretBrainstorm.jpgx  KBgtA problem that weve known about for a while has to do with how we handle High Dynamic Range HDR rendering. Unlike most all? other games were using realistic quantities of light. The difference in lighting environments between space and atmospheric flight is enormous. Unfortunately that creates some rather challenging problems for us. Without getting too technical were losing a lot of contrast when a ship is exposed to high quantities of light and its making it difficult for our artists to properly author their textures. Originally this was going to be fixed in the polish phase of the game but due to its impact on our art team it looks like well have to address it sooner rather than later.export.pngx . MBgtThis week weve started integrating the rough D mockups of the new ships into the prototype. Were looking forward to releasing a patch soon to begin collecting feedback from those of you who have pledged Developer Access as were confident they will require a lot of iteration between now the release of the final game!,Infinity,d1hoqsd,1,t5_2sica
