56346,0,t1_ceksnt4,Pete Rose should be in the Hall of Fame as a player he played as hard as  the game demands and was the best contact hitter in the game. Him betting on his team was a mistake and shouldnt be a reason for his playing career to suffer. Ty cobb was one of the most scumbag people to ever put on a uniform and was voted in for his baseball contribution and nothing else because he was a great baseball player. I understand why Bonds is not in just yet but Pete Rose has served his time. ,SFGiants,cekufko,2,t5_2s5xr

297471,0,t1_cfbb8tc,Oh I dont know about that.I mean Harbaugh took a team with talent that nonetheless was playing like garbage and turned it around in his first season with very little in the way of player changes in key areas.McClellen has had a very successful career as coach of the sharks no denying that.  Jackson is turning the dubs around but its sort of up and down.  The dubs are still one or two players leaving from being garbage again.  Bochy. He has two world series under his belt and he did it with a solid pitching staff and ply wood and duct tape.  Thats a manager.  Harbaugh.  Took a garbage bag of players put em together made em mesh and built a power house.  Hes almost tied with Boch. McClellen.  Hes smart enough not to rock the boat TOO much.  changes here and there but hes is maintaining a playoff quality hockey team.  The sharks are just waiting for that one season where things go right.  While I respect Jackson its a little to early to tell.  Hes certainly doing an excellent job though.  He just needs to find a way to buff out the rough edges.Bottom line with Bochy and Harbaugh the proof is already in the pudding.  McLellen and Jackson have something to prove though.I cant speak to Melvin though.,SFGiants,cfblke6,4,t5_2s5xr

436538,0,t3_1yyfft,Oh man.  I was hanging out at my friends house during the game and checking the box score and reading the plays on my phone using the At Bat app none of my friends watch baseball so there was no point in pulling up a feed or anything.  As the innings went on I noticed the  on the Padres hit counter wasnt changing and I wondered if a nohitter was actually happening or if I was misunderstanding something.  When I read that Timmy was pitching the th I knew shit was actually going down.  I literally just sat there nervously starring at my phone waiting for each out to update and counted them down as I drank excessively.  After the final out I threw my phone on the ground in celebration and began yelling at everyone about how happy I was.  Even though I never watched or listened to a single second of the game that night I still felt like I was part of it and found it very memorable even though my friends probably hated me that night.  ,SFGiants,cfq0g8h,2,t5_2s5xr

773957,0,t1_cgs8buo,I just disagree. Yes the sample size is too small to form any longlasting observations about Belt. Like Im not going to start saying that Belt is a terrible hitter even though hes struggled a lot in the earlygoing. But we can draw some conclusions about what hes been doing so far with the caveat that the sample size is small. A small sample size doesnt prevent an analysis it adds a footnote onto it that we should take these results with a grain of salt. For example this article draws conclusions after an extremely small sample size because we know that velocity stabilizes very quickly. Im not saying Belts PAs and velocity are the same thing but clearly small sample sizes dont stop analysis altogether.,SFGiants,cgs94pv,2,t5_2s5xr

784538,0,t3_233i91,Pitch repertoire! Or I Thought Josh Beckett Had Run Out of Nerves in his Hand? Reference glossary and little explanation here.Nearly quick notes Ive added overall numbers for the pitcher and GB on the pitches. The former so we can get a more complete profile of the pitcher and not just his individual pitches wOBA allowed is listed rather than wRC. The latter because ground balls are a good thing to shoot for as a pitcher theyre almost always outs sometimes theyre a grand daddy two outs and ground ball pitchers tend to suppress home runs. Also considering scrapping Swing and adding OSwing chases. Anyway JOSH BECKETT.Heres what Josh Beckett threw in . IP in .|Pitch|used|Average Velocity|Swing|Zone|Contact|SwStr|HRFB|GB|wRC allowed||||||||||||seam fastball|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|||seam fastball|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|||Curveball|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|||Cut fastball|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|||Changeup|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|||OVERALL|||.|.|.|.|.|.|. wOBA|This is data from Becketts last full season.  is too far removed which is a shame because  was Becketts worst full season and his strikeout numbers were at a career low. So I have no idea what to expect from him and neither should you. Maybe hes an injured husk of former upanddown pitcher or maybe he has enough of an ability to mix speeds and locate to be somewhat effective in the final year of his contract hey if Zito can do it?. Becketts always been a mix of fastballs some sink on them too with a pretty good curve mixed in. In his first start this season he laid off the cutter and curve and it was mostly rising fastballs. Still that was four innings of sample and we should have little idea of what to expect from a pitcher returning from a grabbag of injuries. What was Beckett? Pretty good with his fastballs and a curve. What is Beckett? Maybe good with his fastballs especially the seamer and a curve. ,SFGiants,cgtgexp,10,t5_2s5xr

981225,0,t1_chftepa,Haha there were huge jumps but I expected that since the replay is  hours with commercials and the game was in extra innings. Already in the th! I have this weird feeling like good things are about to happen I wonder why....Hey you will get absolutely no argument from me. The only reason I wouldnt want him at B permanently is because Belts bat is so vital to our team. At least LF is the easiest position defensively besides B. An idea I just had obviously Belt would need a ton of practicefly balls in LF first but would moving him there be a good longerterm solution at least for this season? Im not sure its a great move because Belt is so great defensively at an extremely easy position defensively but still and we dont know how Morse is defensively at B surely better than he is in LF defensively but his career UZR at B in . innings played there is . ouch but that may be mostly dragged down by . UZR in  at B. However he played . innings at B in  and  innings in every other year of his career so that . is probably most accurate. Why does Morse have to suck so much defensively everywhere??? I honestly didnt even know you could get a . UZR at the easiest position possible defensively... lt that sentence got majorly sidetracked so Ill just start a new sentence haha. So Morse sucks hard at LF and B so I now rescind my putting Belt in LF idea because it seems like Morse will suck wherever he plays defensively and wed be weakening  positions defensively by putting Belt in LF. Anyway yeah I have to cringe a bit at the praise too. I know that we can say SSS till were blue in the face but people are still going to look at this seasons results and love him. Oh god the praise he gets on defense for not having errors is so awful. Yes he doesnt have more errors because he simply cant get to a bunch of balls.... Thats going to be an uphill battle all season for reasonable thinking on him.Haha the Hicks HR happened a while ago but I mightve snuck a peak at the box score beforehand so I was paying close attention to that PA. Hicks just waited and fucking golfed that ball into the seats astounding. On an  count too. I believe one of the Ks said he was waiting for offspeed and he got exactly what he was looking for it seems. Thats both spectacular and also unsurprising that that was the first curveball home run ever off Kershaw. Hicks is love. Hicks is life. And ujman is still on the Adrianza train for shame. shhhhhh nobody mention SSS,SFGiants,chftnm8,3,t5_2s5xr
984417,0,t1_chg5sub,Haha of course not I was just pointing out that he was the best B in the league by wRC in . Not that he was chopped liver in other seasons. Last season he had a . BB . K . ISO ... slash line . wOBA  wRC and . fWAR. Those numbers vary from pretty good to great. He created  more runs than a league average player. For perspective Pablo was a top B last season by wRC. He is clearly a good hitter and a good B in the MLB. Nobody else is going to even come close to his production for us at B barring a massive trade. Arias is  times worse than Pablo with a bat. Adam Duvall cant even put up those numbers in AAA never mind the bigs. NOONAN! has struggled mightily in his small amount of time in the big leagues so far. What magical solution do you have for B that is going to hit better than Pablo? Because Id love to hear it. Do you have any proof that Pablo is unwilling to learn adapt and improve as a player? Or are you basing that conclusion off one months worth of PAs in  when you have  other PAs telling you differently? Batting average is an extremely poor way to judge any hitter. I recommend using OBP. Oh yeah injuries are definitely a concern with Pablo they always have been. But Im saying when hes healthy and getting PAs hes always produced. The entirety of his  year career has shown that. A bad month doesnt wipe all of that away. He is a middleoftheorder bat with power. Hes routinely one of the top  often better B in the MLB. Theres a reason neither the Giants nor Bochy have considered replacing him this season.,SFGiants,chg6pho,1,t5_2s5xr

Cuetos started doing something really smart this season hes throwing more fastballs which are very good and have induced very good results for him and fewer offspeed pitches. The changeup has plenty of run and thats his primary offspeed pitch to lefties though hell actually throw the seam more often when hes ahead. To lefties the slider is his primary offspeed pitch though he likes throwing the changeup to them when he has two strikes.

1705584,0,t3_2dxh0x,No. No no no. What Sanchez needs is to sit out the rest of this year and start next year in Fresno. He can still be a legitimate catcher but not if the Giants foolishly use him as a back up. If anything he needs to just play everyday if not a change of scenery. Susac could be a good hitter and a good catcher but he wont mature either if hes a back up. Its fine for this year as he gets his feet wet but unless they figure some way to get him playing most every game that doesnt involve moving Posey to third hed be better used as a trade chip. Posey is not getting out of the crouch any time soon,SFGiants,cju5g1x,8,t5_2s5xr
1706416,0,t3_2dxh0x,No you dont give up on a player when hes  years old. If Hector was in his mids then yes this is all hed ever be. But hes not. As others have mentioned he needs regular everyday work somewhere and a hitting coach to specifically work with him on the holes in his swing along with a catching coach to improve his defense. You dont even say what youre suggesting specifically DFA him? Trade him? What? DFAing him would be idiotic because he still has value. His trade value is pretty low at the moment because of his injuries. So now might be one of the worst times to get rid of him. Susac has been great..... in the minors. Dont get me wrong I expect him to eventually be great in the majors too but he might not be ready to play in the bigs every day yet. It seems like he needs more seasoning. Through  PAs in the big leagues we know very little about him. If you insist on forming an opinion based on those PAs his wRC is a paltry  his ISO is a terrible . and his SLG is an awful .. Yes Hector has struggled but he can improve if given time to work on his faults on a daily basis. I totally support moving Posey to B if we dont resign Pablo but Susac might not be ready for an everyday catching role in the MLB even by next season. We need Hector for now whether hes backing up Posey Susac catching for the Giants while Susac becomes fully ready to assume his big league role or just as catching depth in general. This is kind of an entirely different topic but I dont support moving Belt to LF and Posey to B. Im sure Belt could be an OK LFer with a ton of practice but that weakens  positions defensively. If were moving Posey out of the catcher role and moving him somewhere then move him to LF. It only leaves one position weakened defensively besides catcher if SusacHector are worse defensively than Posey behind the plate but that will be a problem regardless of where we move Posey. If laterera Barry Bonds could play LF then Im sure Posey could manage it with a ton of offseason practice.,SFGiants,cju97wl,3,t5_2s5xr

A descriptor like utterly uninspiring would be more apt for Arias OPS of something. Cabrera still would have been an upgrade for the Giants at nd for a good portion of the season.

Its a common playertype that bats nd in the lineup that youll see on many teams.Protecting the plate refers to two things mainly Youre going to swing at close pitches that you wouldnt swing when ahead in the count because theres a chance the ump might call it a strike and its too risky.  These often result in foul balls or weak hits that become outs.  Thats the advantage of getting ahead in the count as a pitcherthe batter has to play it safe essentially. Taking something out of your swing.  By just trying to make contact youll naturally not swing as hard because  you cant look in any location or for any pitch.  You kinda just have hope for your best.I cant really think of a basketballfootball analog. Its a oneonone situation where one person has to make the safe high percentage play because they are at a disadvantage.,SFGiants,cl71gep,2,t5_2s5xr

And that was by Tim Hudson in a game they would have lost if baseball games were  outs long instead of .This gets said a lot but I dont really feel its accurate at all. Peavy was great in NLDS Gm a decent start in NLCS Gm only gave up  runs made it to the th in WS Gm before the bullpen blew it and was pulled in Gm after having some bad breaks and again the bullpen allowed a RBI conga line. Hudsons NLDS start was awesome overlooked by the fact that Zimmermann was near flawless and then Petit had to be and was flawless in extra innings. His NLCS start was decent and WS Gm was actually pretty good although the Giants lost . He was pulled in Gm after giving up  runs because its Gm and you dont want to risk opening the floodgates though he very possibly could have settled in and put up a few more scoreless frames given the chance.The shakiest starts were from Vogey  his NLDS start was good NLCS and WS not so much although the Giants ended up winning those games anyway.Other than that though this was a very entertaining read!,SFGiants,cngqpzw,5,t5_2s5xr

2897929,0,t1_cnxfkkz,If you follow baseball and the Giants you should know that stats dont mean anything to a success of a team. Its all about confidence that the guy behind you will get the job done if you fail to get on move a guy over or drive him in. Additionally its all about getting an advantage on  pitch in an at bat. In Paniks case he can look fastball or whatever pitch he wants. Im all for the use of stats but I dont see how stats on Cano McCutchen relate to Panik. Those guys are entirely different players and the Giants win by manufacturing runs which doesnt necessarily mean getting a hit. Say Pagan hits a double with  outs and Panik can look for an offspeed pitch to pull to the right side to get him to rd for a sac fly opportunity. As Kruk and Kuip would say its all about productive outs that can help teams to win. The Giants certainly understand that. ,SFGiants,cnxhzze,0,t5_2s5xr

The problem is the article leads with the Huff stuff with only one actual quote about it then shows what Huff tweeted then only at the bottom finally starts actually quoting Pablo more. Yes maybe some people will change their perception. But I felt I really had something to say and I wanted to get it out.

Edit this is what the person saidgt Looking at those replays Crawford definitely swung at ball four.That just adds salt in the wound. I truly believe that a win like this could have really turned the season around.

If you really want to have people look at it put it in the next days game thread. Thats a great place for stuff like this. We probably wouldnt like it if someone linked to Grant Brisbees write up of the game every single game either. If it were valuable enough to someone they could subscribe themselves. Its cool if its a significant game e.g. World Series win wed probably upvote every article that exists no matter who wrote it but last night was a weeknight stinker. Im going to be generous and assume you are looking for feedback on your content. I dont have great news your writing is very dry and feels pretty low value. In fact I thought I was reading a computer generated article at first. The other big contributors in terms of writing to our sub are quite distinctly voiced and offer something in addition to a recap of the game weve all watched and you should read their work to understand how to add some character to your writing. ,SFGiants,cr923cs,2,t5_2s5xr

Is it an elite player that isnt a complete dickhole?  Its really just unnecessary trash talk because you dont really know what youre talking about.  In the grand scheme of things we dont really know how the inside of the Giants locker room works just like we and your Dodgers fan friends dont know how the inside of the Dodgers locker room works.  And just calling them a crummy team for no reason just comes off as sad and grasping at straws.  Guess what.  The Dodgers are really really good.  Probably better than the Giants.  They have two front end starters who are the elite of the elite.  A bullpen that is coming together with an elite closer.  The best team offense in the league.  Theyre not crummy just like the Giants arent crummy.  Calling them so is doing a real disservice. ,SFGiants,crp24ej,11,t5_2s5xr

Im pretty sure no MLB pitcher would tell you that he should groove pitches right down the middle even with a run lead. Theyre always trying to do the best they can. Yes its extremely unlikely they were going to tie the game but painting the corners as long as hes doing that and not throwing balls is an admirable goal IMO.

4373159,0,t1_csii1b8,Correct me if Im wrong but given that Bonds had a BA of . and an OPS of gt in  it was more likely that he would get an extra base hit if they actually pitch to him. He wouldnt even have to get an extra base hit just a single to deep enough into the outfield might score the runner from second since theyd be running on contact. If they arent going to intentionally walk him they would have to pitch him in the zone not around him as a walk would result in the same result only with the added risk of a walk off hit. With Mayne having a . BA that year I dont see how this is such a bad move.,SFGiants,csil9ke,7,t5_2s5xr

4396094,0,t1_csl607k,Price has said that hes open to negotiating during the season but I agree with you  it would probably have to wait until winter.  Even then though I am confident that the Giants could resign him if they truly wanted to.  They have as much cash as anybody in baseball and the type of clubhouse atmosphere that he apparently loves.  This could very well all be moot though if the Tigers start to play better ball in the next month.I would be worried about getting burned on a rental too but the Giants desperately need another quality SP.  Obviously Hamels would be less risky but RAJs expectations are still probably very unrealistic as far as return goes.  Thats why I think the teams wallet is a big asset here if the Phils didnt have to pay too much of the contract they might be willing to take less in prospects.Just saw your edit.  I live in Tigers territory and you would be surprised at the amount of panic surrounding that team.  Their run differential is currently in the negatives and the offense is not as good as you would expect.  After Price all their other starters have been very inconsistent this year.  Many fans here think they should retool and try again next year.  The bullpen is also shaky as ever after a solid first two months to the season and even Joakim Soria is starting to struggle with homers.  There are definitely whispers about the Tigers being sellers.,SFGiants,csl6be3,3,t5_2s5xr

4438651,0,t3_3bvitx,From Kiley McDaniel who has scouted Fox in person a few times gtFox played last season at American Heritage high school in Delray Beach FL on the same team as  draft prospect SS Jonathan India. Fox played at the PG National and East Coast Pro showcases last summer to get exposure for the  draft and there were rumbling he may transfer so he could get regular innings in the spring at shortstop as India was more polished at the position. Fox ended up moving back to his native Bahamas last summer and registered to become a July nd prospect instead of a draft prospect a designation that MLB is very wary of allowing as other prospects have tried it in the past in an effort to get more money but Foxs Bahamian roots convinced MLB to allow him to become and international prospect eligible to sign starting on July nd.gtFox was smaller last summer around  and ran . or lower in the  at least  speed but his arm was a little shy for shortstop and while he had contact skills he had little power. Since moving back to the Bahams Fox gew an inch added about  lbs. of muscle and is still an easy plus runner but now with more pop and arm strength. The contact skills are still there and scouts would start him at shortstop in pro ball though some thing his actions arent quite good enough to stick and think hell end up in center field. Second base is also possible but hell play shortstop for at least a few years in the minors with upside to be an everyday player at any upthemiddle position. Fox likely wouldnt have gotten more than  million in the draft but projects to get double that on July nd with the Dodgers the most aggressive suitor but the Giants Padres and Rangers are all in the final mix as well.video ,SFGiants,csq6di7,3,t5_2s5xr

When Krukow says That is not the way the Dodgers do things. They have never done things like that. it tells me that he has respect for the team and I think it reflects the attitude of the players as well.

Would like to see Blanco in CF and Maxwell as a late game defensive sub the royals subbed Aoki for Dyson last year. MaxwellBlancoPence top tier outfield defense and what we lose in offense with Maxwell we gain with Blanco over Pagan. This also has the side benefit of potentially causing Aoki missing his minimum number of ABs this season. If he gets below a certain number we can retain him next year at a cheap price. Probably wont be too happy about that but his defense is a problem.And I guess we better hope Adrianza finds his stroke ,SFGiants,ctq9u7f,5,t5_2s5xr

Unfortunately Ive had multiple experiences recently in SF where I feared for my safety. One time a guy followed us a block down the street telling us we were in the wrong city another where a few guys tried to grill us on our true knowledge of baseball and yelled in our faces and just the general food being thrown at us while we are in our seats and general abuse.

5114768,0,t3_3kyde7,I think your opinion isnt too popular around here but I kind of like what you said. This team obviously has a pitching issue but its not a huge issue. The bullpen is still elite and will be next year with the emergence of Strickland and Osich. And the starting rotation was bad but good enough to keep us in the wildcard spot before the injuries to the position players took over. Its rare for such a talented player to reach free agency at a young age. Heyward is a freaking stud and still has room to grow. Signing him to even as long as  years means we wouldnt have him in his late s. A combo of HeywardLeake might be just as valuable to the  team as signing Price and probably less detrimental to the team in the early part of next decade. ,SFGiants,cv2irfq,5,t5_2s5xr

I think for the most part the entire season numbers will speak louder than one game said Leake who was  with a . and careerbest . WHIP in  starts.  Leake said he enjoyed his time with the Giants whose needs and finances suggest they could make a strong pitch for Leake who hinted geography could play a part in his decision.  I grew up in San Diego. I do enjoy being on the West Coast he said.    Matt Cain who pitched five scoreless innings Sunday will have a chance to return to the rotation next year joining Madison Bumgarner and Jake Peavy.I want to be right there with Bum doing what hes been doing said Cain who also praised the work of Leake and rookie Chris Heston.

6736172,0,t3_47uhef,I got a bit bored so I broke down Cuetos pitching motion and compared it to Timmys.....and some classical weaponry!Cueto gets a lot of his power from his core similar to a hitter.Notice how his abs and back muscles twistthat builds up torque centered on the axis between his right leg through his right shoulder and up to his head. When he starts to come around he begins to move forward with his left leg followed by his glove hand. As the left side of his body leads his leftside muscles contract while his right side muscles release their tension bringing all of that momentum through his exploding legs his unwinding torso and his slinging arm. His pitching motion is like half of a ballistae. His motion allows for less strain on his arm despite a low release point but it also means that when something is wrong or off on a given day he has three moving parts to diagnose or fix. Compare Cuetos wholebody movement to Timmys Lincecum derives all of his power from his legs. His high leg kick stores potential energy and his sweeping motion down releases it gradually. Timmy needs to time the release of his legs energy with his arm whip. Notice on Timmy that he drops the ball down to his ankle before whipping it up and over his head like a trebuchet his left leg acts like the counter weight that propels his arm and the ball. But when Timmy has a problem with his hips his motion and strength is severely restrained. ,SFGiants,d0g2ua3,4,t5_2s5xr

Our bullpen has been extremely skilled well coached well rested overall healthy and some might say a little lucky over the last several years.   Unlike a consistent .  hr hitter relievers are not usually as reliable as ours have been.   The entire bullpen could completely implode at the drop of a hat without warning just ask our neighbors across the bay and decimate an entire season.  Not saying we shouldnt be confident in the bullpen going forward.  Just be careful with statements like that. ,SFGiants,d0uf7m5,2,t5_2s5xr
6882201,0,t1_d0wd1r0,When you watch MLB.tv games they black out the games that are in market so you are forced to go through the local TV stations to watch them since teams get paid TONS of money to allow them to broadcast their games. I cut cable and use aps HD antenna etc.. to watch TV but there wasnt anything to watch live sports other than MLB.tv but the games would be blacked out. So this AdFreeTime app allows you to set your location in a different area so the MLB.TV thinks you are somewhere else and allows you to watch the local Giants game online. Its only month and MLB.tv is  for the whole season which is about HALF of my regular monthly cable bill. Once you purchase this service you allow it to track your IP address and then change your DNS settings on your device to allow the broadcast to come through. THey have step by step instructions on their website so you dont have to be an IT professional to do this. ,SFGiants,d0wevw5,2,t5_2s5xr

Next best is the Nats with . Going to do some more diving in to the depths of Bref. Wish me luck.Later edit in the nd half their LOB which is opposite of the stat above is th in baseball at . so almost exactly their average for the whole year even slightly better. If you like the stat WPA Win Probability Added the bullpen has actually been alright at that coming in th teams with a . WPA in the nd half. Honestly every single stat I can find points to the Giants bullpen having incredibly bad luck when it comes to close games. It just feels worse because almost every run they give up is in a close game. Their BABIP is the best out of all  teams but their K is th out of  and BB is almost exactly in the middle. ,SFGiants,d7cekaa,8,t5_2s5xr

8880578,0,t3_51vrpk,gt What is just driving you insane about your race to the post season in ?Probably the most frustrating thing about this team right now is that postASB they have the worst record in the majors. Compare that to having the best record in the majors preASB. We were better than the Cubs now were worse than the Twins. Theyre not fundamentally this bad. All the pieces are there. But the bats arent hitting and when they do the pitching gets lit up and vice versa. Or the bullpen blows it. Something always seems to fail at just the right or wrong moment to lead to the L. And who knows maybe we got a little swept up in evenyear hype but with the way this team was preASB we felt like we were going into the playoffs strong. Now we dont even know if were going to get to the playoffs and even if we do if wed make it past the first round.

9203242,0,t1_d8iiiki,The Giants  I think in the first instance Tim Lincecum. When he was actually good. Incredibly cool dude that could throw some very interesting pitches. My partner bought me a shirt with his name and also a book on baseball so I could learn the terminology of all the different pitches. ers  Im a big fan of Navorro Bowman and what their D used to be. I followed his progress all through that gruesome injury rehab and will admit I nearly cried to see him have to be carted off hurt again the other night. Massive respect for Bow. SJ Sharks  I have Brent Burns jersey. Saw some real physical hard hitting stuff by the Sharks via an online stream and got hooked. Lakers  Bay Area fans or at least quite a few of them will be disappointed to hear this lol but Kobe and Shaq were too mesmerising. Duke  Had the basketball team recommended to me as a strong team to watch. Started talking all things Duke online after watching some games and made some great buddies from North Carolina and beyond. Now addicted to both their hoops and their football teams. Stanford football  A friend of mine went to Stanford and with lots of links with the ers over the years I look out for their games and root for them. I think thats it... Lol. For now.

I recall a few articles definitely one by the Brisbee fawning over Sabez ability to find a diamond in the rough like Torres.He played a huge part in that team being able to win. The  Giants just didnt have the offense to win consistently and Sabean hit snake eyes on just about every dumpster dive in .Torres who actually played his way into the lineup in ...halfway through the year Boch realized he was the best hitter on the team besides Pablo. Huff who had the ultimate dead cat bounce. Pat the Bat Burrell. Cody Ross.Put those guys in the lineup get Molina out of there for Posey and you get an  OPS team and turn them into a  OPS team. And by the end of the year they were better than that  in the World Series every starter had an OPS over  except for Pablo at  and Renteria at . Which is OK for a shortstop anyway and definitely OK when you go and win the MVP and hit the biggest home run in the history of the franchise besides Bobby Thomson.,SFGiants,d8yy56j,7,t5_2s5xr

11085689,0,t1_deoj32u,Do you mean Moore had a better ERA while playing with the Giants or only when pitching in San Francisco? Because Samardzija had a better ERA in every respect than Moore last regular season and if you mean pitching in San Francisco why would that matter?I just dont see why youre going after Samardzija when he had a decent season and was much improved last year. Blach could be good but he probably wont be much better than Samardzija if at all. I want to see Blach win the th spot but since hes already facing an uphill battle winning the th spot what makes you think hes going to take Samardzijas spot? It just doesnt make any sense. Samardzija isnt going anywhereAnyways to sum up my thoughts on Samardzija Samardzijas contract wasnt that bad for last year because he was decent starting pitchers get paid a lot and its only going to increase but who knows how hell pitch for the rest of it. You cant expect him to turn into an ace just because our front office had to go out and sign a pitcher in what I think was a thin starting pitcher market. if Im remembering correctly He has a high ceiling but a pretty low floor so theres a chance his contract could turn into a disaster. Well just have to wait and see I might be converted to your side lol. ,SFGiants,deojx49,2,t5_2s5xr

11525471,1,t3_64hpfr,I definitely fall within that camp. I definitely dont like his steroid use but considering the era and environment he played in his decisions are understandable just not excusable.My main beef with him is his wellearned reputation as a selfish teammate and allaround clubhouse cancer. Jeff Kent will forever be a hero to me for standing up to Bonds in the dugout in San Diego. Part of whats make the current era of Giants baseball so great to me is the fact that theres been minimal ego involved a far cry from the Bondsled teams of the early s.Thats why I was very disappointed in the Giants for hiring him to a full time position. Now im fine with him being brought in for a week as an annual spring training instructor Morse said Bonds was very helpful in this capacity in . Im even ok with Bonds getting his number retired and giving him a pregame ceremony in his honor. But Im not fine with him getting a statue and Im definitely not fine with him having a full time position with the team and being around the parkplayers on a daily basis.,SFGiants,dg2ewzr,1,t5_2s5xr

And even if he could go more innings it would burn him out and youd be able to use him less days. And why waste your best reliever right away...And you act like its guaranteed a starter could just come in and finish it. They would have  innings to go even our starters who threw the most innings averaged just over  innings per start. What happens when they get knocked out of a game early? You put in a worse reliever in the highest leverage situation? Doesnt make sense.,SFGiants,dg2v8o2,5,t5_2s5xr

We have a ton of baseball left to go. Anyone will tell you that its early in the seasonwere not even through the first month. Theres really no telling whether or not this will carry through to the All Star game. A bad start maybe can reveal some problems but it doesnt mean the team will do terribly for half the year or longer.I agree with you on Melancon. We are really overpaying him and I think we should use him more. I also think were not using our best relievers not that even those are great in highleverage situations. Thats something that definitely needs to be fixed. And Im not saying necessarily to hope for anything haha.
