4430210,0,t1_csp1hkv,To make sure my main issue is made clear. The idea of following someone just to get their attention and the idea of unfollowing them if they dont follow back is what I really hate. That whole tactic can be easily adjusted into something else that isnt manipulating the system and doesnt toy with peoples emotions. That may be an extreme way to phrase it but thats the best way I can say it.,KroFam,csp48ls,0,t5_38dmq
