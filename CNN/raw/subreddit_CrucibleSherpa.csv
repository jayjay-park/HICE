After the win BMK went out of his way to coach us all to bring the adrenaline back down and get calm for the next game.For someone who has been working for the past few months to get better at Crucible in general it was a treat to play with these guys.

For instance GernaderJakes vs where he explains his decisions and then shows practical applications of his choices have been very helpful for me to learn how to better play when outnumbered. uexileCito is a sherpa and youtuber who makes a lot of that same kind of content great as instructional material.

8069123,0,t3_4c3yry,Ive known Bit for years so Im not trying to be too subjective. I played Destiny a handful of times when it first came out and then stopped until pretty much months after TTK. I slowly started getting back into it and playing with Bit definitely makes it worth while. Im not the best when it comes to patience and strategy or even remembering the map layout so it took a while for me to really get an understanding of ToO. Luckily I had Bit by my side. The dude is so patient and understanding and willing to share knowledge its ridiculous. He never really allows anyone to take the blame for a loss other than himself. We havent been able to make it to LH together yet pretty close a couple of times but itll happen soon enough. Honestly hes been building me into a better overall ToOCrucible player although that may take some time. A loooooooooooooong time. But at least during the adventure Ill be able to listen to him rage when someone bags him after a death.,CrucibleSherpa,d4n1njy,1,t5_39rgi
