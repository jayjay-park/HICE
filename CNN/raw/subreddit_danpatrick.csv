6610244,0,t3_4637qe,I listened to the podcast first and it didnt seem so bad then I watched the video... Was she like super high?! Dan said they were on different levels could have been a reference to her being high. It was bad and very cringeworthy. The first time she was on the show about a year ago wasnt bad by the way her  second hug with Dan before the interview was just weird too. ,danpatrick,d031znl,6,t5_2utdx
