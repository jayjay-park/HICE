1375400,0,t3_29oghs,Id throw Scratch Kitchen into the mix. Really great food in a unique location the ground floor of a parking garage. A solid beer list. Their brisket is outta hand good and everything is made inhouse.Also if you want to venture a little outside downtown Salem take a drive over to Karls Sausage Kitchen in Peabody. Amazing place to sit and have a stein of beer a great German meal that features housemade sausages. I will definitely back up uDollfaceKilla on the A amp J King recommendation. Amazing pastries sandwiches and they make a great cup of coffee. Look for the ham and cheese croissant andor a goat cheese scone to go with a tall dark roast. You will not be disappointed.,SalemMA,ciooyqr,2,t5_2zuwm
1829548,0,t3_2fh5ve,Heres a more reasoned look at the accusation. I think that especially in a city like Salem we should be very wary of presumptions of guilt.,SalemMA,ck9nj1w,1,t5_2zuwm
4938344,0,t1_cugt7as,No not Waltham. Not sure why anyone would say that. Thats at least  minutes away. Nearest towns would be Marblehead Peabody Danvers which is where the actual witch trials took place. ,SalemMA,cuh0nn8,2,t5_2zuwm

5933880,0,t3_3wjagj,Craigslist isnt shady but its too early for places in July to be listed. There are a lot of students that live in South Salem and go to Salem State University so you might get lucky and be able to sublet someones room for the month while they are gone or something. ,SalemMA,cxxgnbl,1,t5_2zuwm

10177809,0,t3_5kjyjw,In addition to the other recommendations I would add the Jodi Bee Bakery for sweet and savory vegan treats soup and drinks.  Koto has a varied selection of vegetarian sushi options and theres Indian options with Passage to India in Salem. Hope that helps. ,SalemMA,dbxpllk,2,t5_2zuwm

11064103,0,t3_5xwkhz,Bit Bar Harrisons and Silver Moon sound like theyd all be right up your alley. Getting an apartment and staying local will for sure help as well since depending on where youre located it might almost make more sense to stay on foot and explore. Join groups. Ive met a lot of people doing things like joining the North Shore Poke GO group. If you like love music Koto is a great spot to meet people and Annie and Leo are the nicest people youll ever meet. Just throw yourself out there. Theres always something going on in Salem. ,SalemMA,dem3o4s,2,t5_2zuwm
