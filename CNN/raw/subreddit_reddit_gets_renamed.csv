9959207,0,t1_db5nk3p,I spend a lot of time on rnamenerds actually! I love discussing names in general over there and giving feedback but I have also found they tend to have an attitude of if youre changing your name it needs to be very plain or else its tryhard. Like a recent couple of threads basically came to the conclusion that naming your child Ignatius is great but naming yourself Ignatius is ridiculous. Thanks though!,reddit_gets_renamed,db5pl4w,5,t5_319fm
