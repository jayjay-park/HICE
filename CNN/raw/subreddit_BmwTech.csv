578003,0,t3_20km7e,Common leaks are the oil filter housing gasket vanos hose the cam and crank sensor orings and I suppose maybe the rear main seal. If it actually is the oil pan gasket the front sub frame does have to be removed to get to it or the engine removed.,BmwTech,cg5z1pe,1,t5_30c6x

1166792,0,t1_chqu94k,I dont think that car has an ICV because correct me if Im wrong it has an electronic throttle. Symptoms of a clogged ICV would be more noticeable when you cold start it and try to drive immediately after. Itll have a loss of power and seem sluggish. My  i had that issue and I cleaned it and all was well. I own an  i now and it doesnt have an ICV on account of it having an electronically actuated throttle.,BmwTech,ci0vttx,0,t5_30c6x

4107138,0,t3_37nrrh,For whatever size bolt you are trying to tighten on your E there is a torque value or tightness ex.  ftlbs assigned to it. Consult a Bentley Manual or do a quick search of Bimmerforums about your problem. Chances are whatever problem you have has occurred numerous times and someone has created a DIY guide. These guides will often list torque values.With the torque value you can then select the proper torque wrench. As stated above a  drive will only be capable of small torque values  drive mid range  high values. Also consider the space you have to work. Where a  and  may both capable of  ftlbs for example the limited space may make the  a better choice. As with all ratcheting wrenches or even with old fashioned flex torque wrenches you need a proper set of sockets to go with them. A variety of extensions and adapters will also be of benefit.Good luck!,BmwTech,croftfd,2,t5_30c6x

7059422,0,t1_d1gjftq,Usually places default to a full build. In our mind it something happens after the fact you will still blame the shop. So full rebuild is the default. What about replacement? Check out carpart.com and see what a replacement in your area would cost. Labor is typically around  hours for a transmission. There are obviously risk with a used transmission plus fluid but it really depends on your end game. Edit The point of the rebuild is that while your in there why wouldnt you replace the other components? The labor is really the same either way its just the parts. If its the band why would you even consider the solenoid? But they didnt take apart your transmission and nobody really knows until your actually inside there. Second opinion would be best first. Otherwise park where you need no reverse! Ive had several clients do that. ,BmwTech,d1gjnq3,2,t5_30c6x

7507132,0,t3_4i32i8,Is the input shaft on the trans loose? The pilot bearingbushing should not be able to slide past the initial tip of the input shaft.

8449919,0,t3_4vd461,This is based on my experience with my  M that I bought at k miles. Ill talk mainly about some issues that you didnt already mention in your post. Some of those issues are the same for E. Theres not much that will leave you stranded. I will reiterate the cooling system because the factory water pump has a plastic impeller and will explode at k miles. The whole system should be done by then. The sub body is prone to tearing at the subframe bushing connection point.Inspect the shock towers for bulging or damage. Also a weak point. The power steering usually leaks at the hosetopipe crimp fittings.Tie rods can develop play around k. If you grab the tire at  and  oclock and jostle it youll feel it. Slave cylinders get weak.Pretty much all the original rubberplastics are going to need replacement regardless of mileage. Not all is critical however. Most issues I would classify as annoyances meaning you could get by without replacement. Inspect the drive shaft flex disc guibo for major cracks before driving away its one of those leave you stranded upon failure parts.RTABs FCABs VANOS VCG,BmwTech,d5xryrs,1,t5_30c6x

10370974,0,t3_5ogktn,Pull your spark plugs out and see if any of them look blacker than the others. Most common causes of shuttering on Ns are plugs coils and injectors. Since you say the plugs and coils are new I would definitely investigate your fuel injectors. There is an index number on each injector. On the top right when looking at the side facing the exhaust manifold in the car. If that index number is  or less according to BMW those injectors are no good and honestly thats where I would go next if youve done everything you say you have.,BmwTech,dcjm1c7,1,t5_30c6x
