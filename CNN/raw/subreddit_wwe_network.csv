6738211,0,t3_47kfj7,Im late to the party in regards to this topic but I think a lot of good ideas have been thrown around here. I too would like to see the live stream become more of a destination. The idea of a daily or weekly live show that discusses all the goings on in WWE land is a nobrainer IMO. One thing id love to see but it would never happen because Vince doesnt want anyone badmouthing his product is to take a current wrestling podcast and hire their hosts to do a TV show. This isnt a crazy idea as the guys from The Starters on NBATV started out as a podcast right here in Toronto. I also agree with the idea of making the live stream feel more like a network. Have old episodes of RAW and NITRO on Mondays put in some territorial shows from TuesThursday ECW on Fridays and have the entire Saturday morningafternoon block filled with classic WWE saturday morning shows Superstars Challenge WCW Saturday Night and cap it off with a full unedited classic house show.,wwe_network,d0gaf8f,1,t5_393qg

When Bret came back to fight Steve Austin at Survivor Series  things start to pick up and a majority of  good grief they did terrible ratings but their shows were incredibly loose free flowing anything goes anything can happen.

Theyre running down the WM  card and they mute commentary during the grpahic for the playboy tag match or whatever. King says theyre gonna undress and its gone.

9030775,0,t1_d7x57rd,VOD video sometimes is a cut from the livestream always for stuff that is live sometimes for taped shows like NXT. They replace it with a proper VOD version after some time. This is what happened here. They do this since like forever the bot doesnt always pick it up.Proper VOD version may have things changed. It depends. For example Talking Smack this week livestream of the show started with a glitch. The screen quickly flashed a red screen with an error text of some kind and glitched out. Proper VOD version fixed that. Generally speaking proper VOD version always gets rid of the LIVE logo a really noticeable glitch etc..On rare occasions they make the VOD video a cut of a replay from the livestream. This was the case this year with WrestleMania. They had already dubbed the ACDC song on the replay the aired on the livestream right after WM ended and they made that the VOD.,wwe_network,d7xcu9u,2,t5_393qg
