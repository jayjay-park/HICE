4005308,0,t3_36biuh,It looks like a nice gift.  Me personally I would knock out the extra bits of wood in the the bottom lettering that make it look like a stencil tracing. The upper words dont have it and the lower words dont need it to keep the wood together. I think they diminish the quality.,Scrollsaw,crcu3k8,1,t5_2u0w8

4856014,0,t1_cu6merx,Ive previously posted here as urocktooth before I forgot my password asking for advice on a saw as Im UK based and the majority of brands seem to be unheard of and therefore no guarantee on quality. Lurking showed everyone seems to love Hegners and Excaliburs and I happened to find a second hand Hegner on Ebay for  so I snapped it up! Id barely even heard of a scroll saw before coming across this sub so chances are I would have bought a bad brand for a similar price without decent advice.,Scrollsaw,cu6my3l,2,t5_2u0w8

6151455,0,t1_cyormos,No problem. Here are a few more font sites I likewww.houseind.comwww.losttype.comwww.myfonts.comThey all have free fonts and pay fonts. Even on the pay fonts you can generally test drive it on the site and get a generated image to download. I work with Illustrator and Photoshop every day but Inkscape and Gimp are free options that will get the job done. ,Scrollsaw,cyouu9k,1,t5_2u0w8

11367578,0,t3_626hmm,On my latest jewelery box I used thicker paper card stock and cut out pieces for each face you are trying to felt. The card stock needs to be cut slightly smaller than the final size of the face you are putting felt on. Approximately  to account for the felt folding over the card. Cut the felt about an inch larger on each side of the paper. Then at the corners of the felt cut  right up to the corner of the card stock. Using spray adhesive tack the felt to the card stock and pull the sides tight and fold over. Then you can attach the pieces to the inside of the box with hot glue or spray adhesive. I hope that makes sense I dont think Ive said card stock so many times before. I can draw up a quick how to if need be. Its easy to do.,Scrollsaw,dfkhrc8,5,t5_2u0w8
