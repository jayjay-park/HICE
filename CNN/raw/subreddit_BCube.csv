11035281,0,t3_5xkroy,Hey everyone. Hope you enjoy this workinprogress version of the very first CG youll see at the start of the game. We also spend time redesigning Mason so his character design was a bit more inline with the rest of the cast and his personality. Those of you who had a chance to play the Alpha wouldve seen the original version before and I think the current version is a big step in the right direction.,BCube,deitolh,2,t5_2zmt1
