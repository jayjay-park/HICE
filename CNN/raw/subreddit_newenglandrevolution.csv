E.g the back pass vs PHI was partially him but Knighton shouldve warned him that there wasnt room for it. I dont place that squarely on his shoulders   of the time Id say that back pass should be OK.And most of the time I dont see him making terrible decisions or showing a lack of skill as an individual.

I dont think flags are really waved all game with the exception of the Rebellions massive flag. It seems that during the specified chants most people grab them and give them a wave. But the random flag activity at least observing from several rows up always feels a bit awkward. I think we could do a better job giving people a reason to wave flags other than having people be randomly excited. I personally really like holding up scarves raise your colors style. I think that looks really cool especially when theyre all held the right way and not upsidedown. But I agree that it can block views.My favorite thing is the Supah Revs banner.

9558482,0,t3_5bud7b,Thanks for doing this Brian. I really appreciate your willingness to engage with the fans not just here but on Twitter and in the tailgate lots.My question is why does it so often feel like this team takes too long to adapt to obvious challenges? Sometimes its roster deficiencies sometimes its strategy or ingame tactics. I know we cant always run out and sign a big new player that will solve everything but often it feels like were trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results. One example is how it took by many accounts so long to switch the formation this year. Another is the still glaring hole left by AJ Soares departure two years ago which I know there have been some attempts to fill but none have been really successful.,newenglandrevolution,d9ra28z,21,t5_2st7o

My point is that soccer is a small but growing sport in the US and the more soccer fans that are in attendance for the revs the better chances of developing more Revs fans.  Would I like to have a SSS in Boston filled with fans chanting and singing celebrating a MLS cup semifinal win? Absolutely but thats not reality.
