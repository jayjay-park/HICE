1260029,0,t3_28ex6y,They tried to nickel and dime me and my roommate when we moved out. They claimed we ruined the brand new carpet in ways that only a pet could ruin it and we never had a pet seriously. We ended up escalating it and threatening legal action we did some research and found that they are actually owned by a company based in New York so they dont have a registered agent in NC which is illegal. As soon as we brought that up we immediately got our security deposit back in full and they never contacted us again. If i were you i would live in the rd Street duplexes. They are owned by a nice local family that actually built them themselves. We never had a single problem there and its just as close to campus as Wilson Acres. ,ECU,cibdabt,2,t5_2rdu1

3892222,0,t3_34zlhs,. Theyre not terribly tough just a ton of work. If I remember right youre transferring into the BSIT program. In that case Id suggest knocking out some of the elective stuff in addition to Net Env II. Just because of the heavy lab work.. If youre transferring its not required. Almost all IT internships are paid and usually pretty good. Usually about a dozen or so each semester go to Cisco as interns and there are many other companies that have deep roots in ECU.. I enjoy it. Ive had plenty of great opportunities and the coursework gets you some good tech knowledge. Building certs on top of the degree will help out big time.,ECU,cqzy49l,2,t5_2rdu1

4791085,0,t3_3gdijj,I lived in Cotten last year which is right beside Flemming. They are the oldest dorms on campus so dont expect anything too nice in there. In Cotten the rooms were smaller then most other dorms and the bathroom is outdated. ,ECU,ctygegb,1,t5_2rdu1
