10078678,0,t1_dbl7xe1,ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THIS.It is unethical for a potential employer to ask candidates to do work for current clients or for the potential employer in consideration for a job without compensation.They can ask for general input as part of an interview but not a full blown redesign.I recommend that you remove yourself from consideration.,UserExperienceDesign,dbl9tl8,2,t5_2ug9m

11200673,0,t3_5zpokr,Are you me? Hah Im in the same situation in terms of lacking visual design. I can see a design is good but I just for the love of ux cant make a good design without copying another design.Recently I think its not about visual design. Its all about the process whats your process? Explain that well and show some examples in your portfolio. A friend of mine recently made a portfolio got our instructor look over it said it was too many words you need more pictures minimal words are better etc. So she changes it and... nothing. No answers from companies she applied to. Then she changes her portfolio back to the one that went more in depth to her process and bam! Several calls came in a weeks time span. She told me its all about the process. She also told me that she knows a friend whose portfolio was really bland and boring just text and little to no pictures got a  figure UX job honestly I suspect connections at play.... Its all about process and getting the message across. UX your portfolio dont focus on all the un... in... unnecessities? and  focus on effectively communicating your message to the viewer. My cousin reviews and interviews UX designers she tells me that on average her and other people spends not even a minute per portfolio.Get your portfolio out doesnt hurt. Worse case scenario they dont hire you  ask them why what to change etc. At least you learn. Half assing is better than no assing. Sucking at something is the first step at being good at something. I just spent several months on one project for my portfolio my initial plan was to get it all  projects done. But I saw an opportunity so I said fuck it let them know this is what I have this is what I can do and portfolio is a work in progress and lets see where this goes. Worst case scenario its a practice and learning experience. ,UserExperienceDesign,df1kz3i,1,t5_2ug9m
11226747,0,t1_df4cj1u,Yup. In that case put that project front and center and expand the research and analysis portions of your other projects. Your visual design work is going to outshine your research work I have this same problem so you need to make it very clear that you are able to do the full range of functions that are expected from a product designer.,UserExperienceDesign,df4jcqm,1,t5_2ug9m
11499569,0,t3_643img, weeks in the market is nothing. Id say aim to leave the agency world in favor of a fulltime job. There are great opportunities out here in the bay area.Also avoid thirdparty recruiting agencies or Id say dont rely on them. Sounds like you are in a good track.,UserExperienceDesign,dfzh584,2,t5_2ug9m
11673937,0,t1_dgj96w2,Yes international students pay a premium generally so Im wondering where you would have gone that would have had tuition that cheap. As it seems to be cheaper than an inprovince student. Is it  for a full semester?I have a few international friends that are always complaining about the difference between inprovince tuition and international tuition as theirs has traditionally been much higher. ,UserExperienceDesign,dgj99fi,1,t5_2ug9m
