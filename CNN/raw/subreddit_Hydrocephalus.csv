11388990,0,t3_61lss6,Our story is similar in a way to utittoilet. We knew she had hydrocephalus before birth but found out at  days that it was from a golfballsized lesion compressing her brain stem. Shes had  surgeries had seizures and a large clot basically a stroke after her first surgery but has had no cognitive developmental delays. Physically she had some weakness on her left side and was a month or two behind her twin but shes . now and almost caught up. She has a larger vocab but her sister can run faster. If you put them side by side you wouldnt be able to pick out the one that has hydro apart from the shunt.,Hydrocephalus,dfmx8y5,2,t5_2uv8f
