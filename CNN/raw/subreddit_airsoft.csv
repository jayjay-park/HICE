87760,0,t3_1v2v7z,If youre talking about a V mask full ear coverage I had two different issues when I first got mine.. The front of the mask squishes in your face when you wear it without readjusting. I had some serious Guppyface going on when I first squeezed my face into it...had to do some readjustment.The best thing I can recommend is try bending the front of the face mask into more of a cage instead of a close fit mask.  Visualize it like trying to make the mask bulb out like a ninja turtle lower face kind of roundish on the cheeks and flat on the front.  Once you get the mask OFF your face itll be much easier to adjust initially.. The mask straps worked a little opposite of what I thought they would. I found the best option is to make the top a little tight and the bottom a little loose which was a little the opposite of what I thought would work with the top being loose and the back tight.  When I did it with top loose back tight the mask would sit oddly and kind of mash the contact points into my face.  I started by loosening the top straps so they wouldnt be in the way then tightened the back strap until I felt it sat correctly.  THEN I tightened the top strap more than I thought was necessary and loosened it in increments until it all sat perfectly.Alternatively Make the top part as tight as you can so itll ride a little high nose piece kind of reaches the bridge of your nose...makes the middle piece that covers the nose right in your field of vision which feels odd but actually seats very well and then bend the mask so it fits more comfortably with you face shape.  Just keep in mind if the front of your face is making too much contact with the mesh mask its time to start bending it a bit so itll sit further OFF of your face.  The concept is the mask should not be sitting on your face so much as surrounding it in a protective cage.Personal preference of course.,airsoft,ceof58l,3,t5_2qi2x

He is not using that on the field he is showing capabilities of the system. HS has built a polar star that breaks the sound barrier does that make him gay? Showing the capabilities of a system does not mean you have to use the system in that way. Is it gay to own a GTR which is beyond overkill for day to day driving? No. Just because a system is capable of way more than what you use it for does not make the system gay it just means it is better than what you can afford if you think it is gay. ,airsoft,cfh6151,8,t5_2qi2x

Just do what you love.,airsoft,cfn1ww4,1,t5_2qi2x
408402,0,t3_1yr6ja,Ive been to nearly all the West Coast LC events since . The events depend on the caliber of the game control staff and I know John Lus East Coast staff is very sharp so they usually run great events.Registration isnt really a hassle. You wait until registration opens fill out the form and then Paypal the amount you own to the account they provide you. If youre trying to register a team then email John Lu and hell send you a team registration form to streamline things. Just make sure you read everything regarding the event before asking a question. Johns one pet peeve is people asking stupid questions because they didnt bother reading the rules.As with all milsim ops dont expect to be playing together for the entire time. The rules will encourage and help teams stick together but sometimes you die go back to regen group up with a bunch of dead guys and link up with your team later. When you register as a team game control will keep your group together so you wont be split into different squads or platoons.LC events have people from all kinds of backgrounds. My team has been going for the past  years and were a motley crew of engineers chemists graphic designers bankers accounts and one military guy. My team has two female members and John Lu loves them. He actually actively encourages female airsofters to play to fight the perception that airsoft is just full of dudes and depending on the event he will even offer discounts.Every LC op Ive been to is different. Can they guarantee nonstop action or some kind of crazy scenario? No of course not because its a dynamic and unscripted scenario. Ive had ops when Ive had little to no trigger time but went around capturing objectives and Ive had ops where Ive literally fought to the last BB in my mag in one firefight. The key thing is to make the best of your situation and go into it with an open mind. My whole mantra for the milsim ops is that Im paying to participate in a game where Im helping my team so I have fun whether its awesome firefights or side missions.Is it worth it? Id say hell yeah or else I wouldnt haven gone to  years worth of LC events after my first one!,airsoft,cfn3iso,3,t5_2qi2x

He asked me why I wasnt going to buy from him and I told him I bought a TM  which he snorted and said TMs are shit. Maybe ten years ago but now they are crappy plastics. I stopped talking to him and left the store soon after. Tonight I brought a used MP that I bought from a friend boneyard and he was just treating me like an asshole because the gun is in shitty condition and that I dont know how to take care of my guns. On top of that both times he insulted the field I go to and the owner of it who has been pretty good to me since I started all in all he just is an abrasive person.

475792,0,t3_1zjzr8,As a part time recon guy who has played plenty of times on huge wooded fields there are a few things that are really the key to being sucessful recon or sniper role. . Hides. Setting up a hide is the name of the game in sniping. You want somewhere were you have a good FoV and an easy escape route incase of an emergency or discovery of you location. Also dont pick an obvious spot that screams HEY THERES A SNIPER HERE. Like a tower or the crest of a ridge or top of a building.   . Take a shot at people that you know that you can hit. IE People who are stationary. If you risk a shot on a target that is moving you might risk giving yourself away however if you have a fairly accurate and you are very familiar with the flight path of you rifle you can try and risk but i dont recomend it for novice snipers. . Camo. Ive found that ghillie suits arent really necessary I run just a standard  high speed low drag recon kit you can see pictures of it on my previous posts. link to post    . Run with a buddy its a lot more enjoyable and it makes it easier. Two pairs of eyes spot a lot more potential targets than one. Also nothing is more fun that multiple weapon engagements. . A radio is your best ally for you and your team. If you see movements of the enemy team and tell your teammates you have given a huge advantage to your team to set up ambushes or planning attacks also it makes you a team player which is great all around as a sniper.  . Headshots arent cool. Dont go for headshots. Its just being unsportsmanlike for shooting someone in the face on the bare skin with a high powered airsoft gun. Also its a lot harder to hit a head than a plate carrier so just go for the gauranteeded hit instead.. Go with your instinct. Think  before you make a move like picking a hide or changing position there have been plenty of times where I have been picked off because I didnt think of how many people could see me when I moved. . Gas or Spring? Spring. All day eryday. Why? A spring is more relaible than a gas you have consistent FPS no matter what temperature and greatly reduces time to reload mags. .Scope? XX Variable zoom scopes. They get the job done and they are fairly cheap. . Patience. Its a virtue in the sniper game. You rush and dont think you get hit. Follow these and you will be fairly well off for woodland games.Good luck out there man!,airsoft,cfucmbx,4,t5_2qi2x

You may have a compression problem and .s are extremely sensitive to any inconsistency at all which is why many have moved away from them to .s.

For a first experience stick with .vThe average setup will use between  and  Amps so you need to be able to deliver that as a bare minimum. The more you have the less you will stress your pack. To find the amperage of a pack you take the Amps per hour Ah or mAh and multiply it per the C rating. Here its  x    which is just fine.The mAh rating itself will affect the battery capacity. A battery pack with more mAh will have more shots than a smaller mAh pack.So find the biggest battery you can fit and afford on hobbyking and have fun.

795046,0,t3_238wm3,I was playing my first game with my brand new jg gk and I just killed a guy ran past him and down to a creek bed. Ran to the end of the creek bed and saw another player too far away for me to hit. I waited for him to move and I sprinted full speed on a bunch of loose rocks. My feet slipped on the rocks and I took a fall directly onto my gun. I got up looked over the gun to make sure it was fine and it was. At this point my knee started hurting so I straightened my legs out and made sure my knee wasnt broken it wasnt. I looked down at my right hand and it was a little bloody at the base of the pinkey then looked at my left hand. My left pinkey decided he wanted to jut out at a  degree angle at the middle joint. I panicked and pulled it upwards and straightened it out. Needless to say that was simply idiotic of me. Then I continued to be an idiot and proceeded to not take a visit to the hospital and figured I had set it right. I was wrong. TLDR I fell within the first  minutes of the first game I played with my brand new jg gk and dislocated my pinkey. Not sure if bad luck g or just my luck.,airsoft,cguneyc,1,t5_2qi2x

1400303,0,t3_2a55ui,This has been my philosophy for sometime. Before I was hard on myself and was way too tryhard. Now I just relax and have fun. In time I either found I had skill or just got better because now Im transitioning into a rusher. Ive learned that people are surprisingly lost in the middle of a game they dont know how to move up or they lose their nerve when they get pinned down usually a middle schooler wielding a combat machine. IMPROVISE ADAPT OVERCOME. Go through the motions and know that you will be fine if you watch your angles and weigh your risks correctly thats where only experience can help you.If I concentrate on the objective and retain a tactical mindset I will start being apart of the force that turns the tables midgame. Also if youre going to bark commands at people you better be charging in with them.,airsoft,cirt45h,3,t5_2qi2x

Like outside temperature.Also take off the slide and look at the rear of the frame. There should be a few little nubs sticking up do any of those look worn down or bent?In case you dont know to take down the slide remove the magazine and rack it once to be sure the hammer is drawn back.

1745087,0,t1_cjz4emv,I did youre absolutely right hence why I didnt stealth edit it.  But the results still stand.  That being said however personally Ive got a TK twist in three guns at the moment and with the right hop setup they do work better than my Prommy EG at m.    But again were into a lot of issues resultswise because the only direct correlation I can make is the TM scar TK Twist vs the EG in my TM RS M  EG which have different barrel lengths and cylinder volumes.   The SCAR with a shorter barrel mm will give me  hits on a torso sized metal plate at m.   The M mm manages around the same.  However I havent set it up as scientifically as the tests linked so I cant really say that you can replicate the results.  Was it an improvement over the stock TM barrel?  More or less but honestly stock TM barrels are pretty good so its a very slight increase.   Honestly Im not even sure it was worth it at this point the Recoil Shock guns are stupid accurate even at their power level.I personally think theyre great barrels for the guns I have them in.  Ive had to tune each of them to get the results I need which need to be done with any setup.   Also contrary to the OP I have not seen any particular range increase but I also havent really tried as I dont think it would be effective to really zero a gun out past m if you plan on closer engagements.  Most hop systems cant manage that arc at under J.Edit the third gun is a pistol.  All things being given this may be one of the best applications for the TK twist since a lot of your engagements are around m.   Except that I havent really tested it at all to really know if its better or not.  I should probably do that.,airsoft,cjz4nyc,1,t5_2qi2x

The Condor Harness requires Drings which that belt system doesnt have and the belt system is  wide anyway which is larger than most belt loops for civilian pants and on par with a pistol belt.Wear a regular belt and use the Ronin rig. You should only need one dualmag pouch and one dump pouch. You can get the dump pouch later if you only want to spend  at one time. Understand that you do not actually need a harness that connects to your belt. You are not carrying heavy loads on your rig because the magazines are not made of steel and loaded with  rounds of . each and youre not carrying a bunch of other gear like Etools canteens radios and other gear that an actual soldier might have to carry. You will only need the Ronin rig. It lacks pouches or vest material that are useless to you so it will be more lightweight than virtually all other loadouts. If you want suspenders get regular belt suspenders that clip onto your beltpants. ,airsoft,cjzqk9q,1,t5_2qi2x

Also with a GBBR theres always the issue of if itll be too cold outside to use the gun. AEGs are ready for any weather usually.You will almost always be shorter ammunition than your enemy. With AEGs there will always be high capacity magazines or readily available magazines. It takes a lot of trigger discipline and taking your shots sparingly with a GBBR. With AEGs you can blast away because you will have a larger supply of ammunition.

1820874,0,t1_ck8lb7v,Yes I do own a Stark Arms Glock Currently just a  however I plan on buying the Gen   on airsoftglobal soon. Now on to the barrel I can make a video but you wouldnt be using a normal cordless drill or drill press to make the hole on the end of the barrel larger. You would have to mount it in a lathe and then drill it using that if you tried to do it without a lathe chances are it would just make a mess. You could also make a fixture to mount it in Like a soft Jaw vice to us to mount it in a CNC mill and then mill the hole to a larger diameter but unless you have a CNC mill you wont be able to do that method. Depending on how easy it is to make the barrel accommodate the threaded adapter I may start selling barrels that are already drilled and thread to accept the threaded adapter so if it all works out the way Im planning I could always make  you one. I plan on posting my results in a thread quite soon so keep a look out for it. Please feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. ,airsoft,ck8loh1,1,t5_2qi2x

1827336,0,t1_ck9dgik,Ive got an AK so its gonna be a little different than mine but i have included pics to help. This metal tube is the feeding tube it tucks into the hole on the magNow here is a high cap which lines up perfectly with the feeding tubeNow here is the mid cap it doesnt line up as well so it refuses to fit in the magwell. Ms are different since because you dont have to rock the mag in you can just push it up it makes it so it doesnt have to be lined up as well. Mine is off by about an  of an inch so it doesnt work. Like i previously said Ms are different so the mag might move the feeding tube which is connected to the barrel so that would move too giving you a shitty air seal. Some electrical tape or soft side velcro adhered to either the front or rear spine of the mag might fix it but dont put so much on that the mag gets jammed up there. ,airsoft,ck9dvwa,1,t5_2qi2x

1919633,0,t3_2gmgnm,The best stock Glock type pistol would either be a Marui or the Timberwolf.

I would recommend either but it you do buy a Marui I would plan on buying a metal slide and outer barrel if you use propane.WE Glocks are also good but only when some work gets done with them. They usually need a new outer barrel new hop up buckingbarrel and a small mod to the nozzle return spring guide it needs to be filed down shorter to avoid breaking the nozzle. They have nice lightweight aluminum slides that have their features machined out. With this said the WE is not the way to go for a stock pistol.,airsoft,ckki3z4,3,t5_2qi2x

That plus the cost of m shells and spare mags. I really like the gun  like I said  it is good even if left stock.

2106297,0,t3_2j1l04,So you are not getting any noise at all it is more than likely an electrical issue and since you have already ruled out basically everything else its more than likely the trigger contacts. If its the trigger contacts  either the soldering came loose or wasnt done right. No way to tell unless you open it really. But from what it sounds like probably wasnt done right considering how new it is. The other issue could be the contacts themselves not making... Contact. When you pull the trigger in full auto there should be two distinct phases. The first should be really easy then after you should feel a slight resistance. If you feel no resistance then probably one of the tabs broke off. Either way gotta open the gearbox to know. ,airsoft,cl7k12h,2,t5_2qi2x

2328953,0,t3_2lytsq,Get a . Nihm or . lipo. A lot of guns seem to come with shitty .v batteries. I believe its just a way to keep the costs down while still providing the user a beginner battery. Your gun might also wear out slightly faster using a . nihm but its basically the minimum I see people using these days. Youll get better trigger response higher rof and much longer use per battery than the one that came with your gun. Get as high mah as possible while still being able to fit your gun. If you want a Nihm Id recommend intellect batteries. Also get a smart charger if you dont already have one. Tenergy is a good brand for that. A . lipo will perform similarly to a . but youll presumably get even better trigger response and the ROF will stay constant until the battery runs out rather than with nihms where the ROF will drop slowly as the battery drains. And youll need a lipo charger. ,airsoft,clzkl1d,2,t5_2qi2x

2789612,0,t1_cnl4i51,The GampG G much like GampGs G is basically a lightlymodified clone of a Tanaka gun Kark and M AICS respectively. Unlike the PPS I believe it is just different enough to not be Tanakacompatible the same problem afflicts the G in various ways.The key problem you will have with the G is that its almost impossible to adjust its power. Thats OK if all you want it to do is go bang when you pull the trigger but it renders the gun utterly useless as a sniper rifle for which consistency and predictability is everything.  A truly great sniper rifle will have a maximum of fps deviance a good one not more than fps. As this review demonstrates the G is more like fps I cannot state this too plainly  as stock the G will be a truly shitty sniper rifle. The other problem youll encounter is different sites differing muzzle energy rules for sniper rifles with no way to adjust the power youre either going to be unable to use the full extent of the allowance or unable to use the gun at all. The PPS wont necessarily be much better when it comes to consistency but it will at least allow you to adjust the power I assume via a clone of the old Tanaka PCS bolt to compensate for changes in ambient temperature and site limits.As I said in my other comment the only real solution to the above problems is a remote regulated gas supply. You can get such things for about ish all in though they would need custom installation into the Gs stock to be hidden and they would suit the G which can be reloaded stripperclip style without removing the magazine peculiarly well.,airsoft,cnl63gt,1,t5_2qi2x

I banged the outer barrel against a wall and couldnt figure out why my bbs werent feeding no matter what mag I used. After looking at the bucking it was all mashed into the hopup and I delicately put it back on the barrel. Youll see that there is a little groove along the bucking and the barrel and if you dont get it right on the groove then the bucking will protrude and as soon as you slide the barrel back in it will get mashed again. So be careful and delicate when putting the bucking back on. ,airsoft,coaj9y0,1,t5_2qi2x

I just thought back to when all my friends and I graduated from school and suddenly theyre buying k carbon fiber racing bikes after cycling for a year. Wat... And then my sister graduated from school and her and most of her friends did the same thing. It just seems like its something that happens when people first come into money after so many years of not having any.. And given reddits demographic well thats where my guess came from.gtCar and bus  public xport gets me from point A to point B. Apartment and home  rents is a roof overhead and a bed to sleep in.Yeah its really not as simple as that. Maybe if you dont do anything besides go to work and sleep I guess. But for most people there are some pretty clear advantages to living on your own and having your own transportation. The line is indisputably much larger than what Crye offers over a Flyye....gtWhy does it matter how I spend it even if I spend it like an idiot?At the time I was just curious. Maybe I was missing something. Maybe Crye does offer something to an airsofter or guy shooting his AR in the desert that I wasnt aware of. But it really doesnt. The extra build quality is insanely valuable if you have bullets whizzing by you bombs going off next to you or a squadmate needs to drag you by your PC. But for a civilians intents and purposes its all the same stuff. gtSpending money on nice stuff feels good at any ageThis is true. But as you get older and start facing the larger investments that life has to offer you start to consider the benefit you get from your purchases a lot more carefully. For the fiscally responsible buying things just because you can becomes a thing of the past because youre thinking about buying that new boat taking that extended vacation or saving to launch your new startup. I guess Im just lecturing now I just cant help but shake my head when I see money spent so frivolously just because it can be. Not so much because of the actual dollars spent but because its a habit that will have to be broken eventually if you really want to get the most of your life and career.

3231807,0,t3_2x53bi,To get the lower receiver off you need to take a screw out of the bottom of the pistol grip and a pin out of the trigger area. Theres a larger Philips head screw centered in the plate on the bottom of the grip. That one needs to come out.    The pin that needs to come out is near the front of the trigger guard. Inside the trigger guard near the front is this little rectangular spring loaded block. Just above and behind that block is a straight pin that goes all the way through the gearbox and lower receiver. Knock that pin out.    With the gearbox out see if the trigger can now be moved. I cant really tell what is happening from you pictures but its possible that the selector switch is out of whack.,airsoft,cowzdi9,1,t5_2qi2x

I wanted to do some sniping when I first started out but I didnt want to spend about  minimum on a beginning rifle. Plus the field that I go to isnt really that big for sniping. So what I ended up doing was buying an M from CYMA. The M SOCOM that I have has amazing range shoots in a straight line and has excellent accuracy. Not bad for like . All I had to do was buy the gun the M scope mount and put on a hunting scope that my dad had for an air rifle he never used and BOOM!.... Instant low cost sniper. Its also amazing as a DMR too. Not too good for CQB but I managed.,airsoft,coxrnim,1,t5_2qi2x

3263393,0,t1_cp07zs5,Tell me about it! He just walked away as if shit didnt happened! But I couldnt really bitch because that was my nd game ever and he was part of a clan that normally attends the same field I go to.These guys I guess are considered professionals who go to tournaments and Milsims and Ill admit theyre cool guys at times but some of their members can be real assholes or just fucking immature its beyond comprehension. Keep in mind this clan is made up of former military members cops and long time airsoft veterans with gear weapons and experience waaay beyond mine or most other players.My favorite examples of their assholyness One of them refused to call his hits because he thought the other player was using fullauto. The kicker? Semi is the only firing mode the other kid could use. The dude from the clan was eventually kicked from the field when he tried doing it again like  more times and for calling the ref a bitch when he told him to return to baseWe caught them telling each other over their radios to not call hits from players who were considered noobs because Theyre not worth calling for. Seriously?...Another member bitched at my cousin for going fullauto sounds familiar right? when my cousin was only using semi. Overall he acted like a major dick throughout the conflict and our time there. My cousin had GoPro footage to prove to him wrong and offered to show it to the clan member the ref and the manager in order to end this stupid dispute. The clan member refused to show us or the ref his own footage from his GoPro and said I dont deal with cheaters bro!Needless to say we still showed the ref and manager our footage anyways to clear everything up.They had  machine gunners on their team once and they refused to play the match when the ref said that  members from our team can use full auto in order to compensate. Nah man... we dont play that way. Semi or we dont play.. Lol wth?And finally they keep shooting at players who try calling their hits and try to walk off the field. Oh no... Im not talking about the casual  or  extra shots I mean they would always light up the person even when they have their gun in the air as theyre leaving the field. One member from our team who had his son lit up from a PKM bitched at them with the manager and now they dont do it anymore or as oftenBasically with these guys I learned that money experience and equipment doesnt guarantee good sportsmanship. But even with these assholes I still have fun anyways!,airsoft,cp09gco,11,t5_2qi2x

Unlike CYMAs good AEPs which are clones of Tokyo Maruis AEPs this one is an attempt to shoehorn existing parts into a P shell and it hasnt worked well. The gun is comically misproportioned  its much much too thick and slightly larger in every other direction as well  even the rail is offspec and wont fit any lights or lasers and the gun wont fit any holster designed for the P. The decocker has been repurposed as a fire selector basically its pretty bad even by AEP standards.gtIf i use a gas type gun what are my options for playing in the cold and getting more than a few shots off?

National games have severe restrictions on DMRtype rifles which means BASRs have a huge distance advantage over them. Additionally a good sniper team will easily deny access to particular areas to a whole squad if they do their job right.DMRs are typically required to follow a squad which composes of  people. They are not permitted to branch out and do their own thing. A sniper with a BASR is only required to run with a spotter which gives them a huge mobility and stealth advantage.,airsoft,cq5952i,5,t5_2qi2x

3940019,0,t3_35iajf,Are you US east or West? Not all producers are country wide. Get a good battery with your replica. . or . lipo. They take special chargers though and you probably want a lipo bag. A good sling is a life saver. Also good shoulder pads.  MilSim West runs a  hour game immersive game. RAPTAC runs similar immersive games on the mid atlantic region.. We call those two less milsim and more real mil because they work a little bit more for the immersion. Interestingly enough MSW has a game in SC and they partnered with RAPTAC to get it done. Im excited for it.Blacksheep just legit became nationwide last year or the year before last. They run  hour area control games. You get points based on how much ground or key structures you hold during random snapshots of the AO. Typically a MOUT or other AO that can hold  people. They hold annual games at the same places and build events up. The guy that runs it is an old cold era war army major ret so that kind of shows in his games where holding ground is important.This is in contrast to RAPTAC games which are a little more fluid and intel  HVT  VIP  Hearts and Minds based because the guys that run it are Marines that are still in or just got out.American Milsim is more heartland  central OK MS SC. They just started getting into the big time with better rule sets and stuff. I think it was just the year before last that they started to require semi only except for SAW.Lion Claws is like Milsim Lite. Pretty good for dipping your toes into it but to me its in a weird spot because its too casual to be serious and too serious to be casual. If that makes any sense at all. This might actually be what youre looking for maybe. Its sort of vaguely close enough to bring a comparison to what you do over there and yet silly all at the same time. Also talking to MSG Mullen or Col McKnight could be helpful. Call your hits. Dont call other peoples hits. When in doubt if youve been hit or not stay on the safe side and just call it. When in doubt if they were close enough for that grenade to kill them or whatever shoot it out. I wouldnt use a CO pistol because a lot of them are hot. Green gas propane with silicone oil and no smell seems to be a decent propellant. WRT to pistols electric isnt that good because its hard to fit a battery and motor system in something that small and have it both be reliable and powerful enough to want to play with.,airsoft,cr5e9go,1,t5_2qi2x

3976449,0,t1_cr9j8sj,GBB pistols dont work like that.  Its not the spring that provides the power.  The gas does that.  I could bore you to tears with the specifics of how a gas pistol works but Imma try to summarize it for you.When you pull the trigger it releases the hammer which transfers its kinetic energy to the firing pin which juts out and hits the gas release valve on the mag opening it for a fraction of a second.  The released gas is piped into the cylinder where it pushes past the the rocket valve until the gas pressure pushes that forward and seals the cylinder which then pushes forward causing the slide ot move backward until the cylinder head is clear allowing excess gas to vent.  The recoil spring then pushes the slide forward which puts the cylinder in the perfect position to strip another round off the mag and push it into the chamber readying it for another shot.Its not exact but thats the basics of what happens when you pull the trigger on a TM system pistol.,airsoft,cr9jruh,1,t5_2qi2x

4016112,0,t1_cre222x,Assemble your gears and align your piston on the rails without the spring.The ideal transfer of force will be flat  degree angle.  Youll want your piston to catch the pickup tooth at the sector gears  o clock position like this photo showsIn order to properly space the piston back towards this position youll need a rubber washer such as this or purchase Scatterplots sorbothane pads.  Approximately  of an inch is what youre looking for depending on your cylinder heads existing rubber pad.Now with the piston properly spaced back at the  o clock position try to cycle the gearbox with your hand.  Youll see that the piston teeth will bump into the sector gear teeth well before the  o clock position.  Now youll have to shave the teeth down on the piston in order to clear the sector gear to properly catch at the  o clock.The pickup tooth is the very last one.  This does not get touched.  The first tooth immediately after will need to get shaved down.  The second tooth is approximately  shaved or more.  The rd tooth may require about  of it removed.  Do not fully remove the nd and rd teeth as this helps distribute the strain onto the pickup tooth.  Shave a little at a time until it properly clears the teeth and catches the pickup tooth at the  o clock position.The final setup should move freely and look similar to this,airsoft,cre2fgo,3,t5_2qi2x

4025109,0,t3_36l09f,Played a night game at a nearby military base got to be about . Something like  guys playing me being the only civilian.  We decided to play a zombie game with the rules being the only weapons allowed are pistols bolt actions and shotguns.  All the magsshells you can carry but not reloading from speedloaders.  Zombies started with  have no weapons and have to tagtackle in order to infect.   shot to kill a zombie who then sits down and counts to  before reanimating.  Unlimited respawns for the zombies any player tagged by a zombie sits and reanimates in  seconds leaving whatever weapons they were carrying on the ground where they died.  Survivors must keep moving aka no spawn camping zombies.  Play until everyone is a zombie. For as silly a game type as this was especially if you buy into the macho soldier stereotype it was stupidly fun.  All the zombies really got into character with the random groaning and screeching some zombies being walkers and some being sprinters.  Even the  year old  year Army vet sergeant who ran the game was surprised how much it got his heart racing. Good times man good times. ,airsoft,crf3bsu,2,t5_2qi2x

4431427,0,t1_csp7d5s,gt gt gt That is how most armies in Europe use the standard  point slings in their weapons. PYour example picture   Those guys are walking with the rifles in a casual carry position.  This is not an active combat situation and I was talking about sling usage during actual combat like you used the phrase to say that sling are not useful in actual combat.In this picture these guys have their hands free but the sling keeps their gun ready in case they need it right away.  If they did not have a sling because they thought its in the way of combat then their hands are occupied by holding the gun the whole time.Your example picture   These guys are also not in an active combat situation.  Their guns are in a position slightly closer to ready if needed so they have their slings very long and loose around the necks not a good combat position but this is not their normal position if they are in an active combat situation.  They are stuck here for their presence in front of this civilian crowd.Also These pictures show the Russian occupationannexation in Crimea this is probably not the best actual combat scenario to analyze.Im not a US Military member so I cannot speak for any of those units.  Whatever opinions I have said about sling usage I was trying to explain in reference to your discussion about slings being pretty much useless in actual combat actual airsoft combat.I said onepoint sling because thats what the airsofter in this video used in his demonstration.  I never made any initial comments about point slings but you brought that up when I talked about onepoint sling with neck.

Dustiness inside the barrel is normal guns tend to be stocked up on warehouses or even while shipping to a retailers warehouse some silicon oil will fix that right up. If the plastic wont come off at all you should look into getting a replacement barrel any sort of obstruction in the barrel will be detrimental to range and accuracy. I suggest a . tightbore barrel.The motor screw? Are you referring to the one at the bottom of the plate? Thats weird. Whats even weirder is that the motor had enough height to spin the gears without the height adjustment screw. Anyways these things happen. Try and screw it back it maybe it loosened itself out? Alternatively your threading in the motor plate might have loosened this would explain why it came off in the first place. If you were running the motor bouncing up and down would hit the adjustment screw and if there were no threads to hold it in place it would come right off.,airsoft,csqampu,2,t5_2qi2x

With that said I for one encourage diversity when it comes to guns. Oh the M is so good because it has ask these spare parts everywhere. Guess what. Plenty of guns out there that use the same gearbox and other parts as the M. And since this is airsoft real steel specs doesnt matter. Debates around AKs vs Ms dont mean shit in airsoft. They could literally have the same components inside probably not but in theory they could. Airsoft guns are  aesthetics  ergonomics. The reason a popular gun like the M is good is only because of the amount of spare parts. If youve got a fun that uses the same gearbox is just as good. Theres a list here somewhere of guns that use M internals but Im on my phone in bed... So either search for it or Ill see if I can remember to edit it in tomorrow.

I was not happy with its default performance so I revamped everything in this puppy except the barrel setup!

The only GB parts that are the same is the unnecessarily reinforced GB shell and barrel set up. As for externals I personally have added an unknown brand railed gas block and I have added a Matrix? T plus the paint job. Regarding the decal I personally designed the team logo and had uDoWhileGeek print out the decal. For the record he does good work I would recommend him! As for the design I am currently in art school for graphic design so I spent a fair amount of time with the logo. My buddy and I the only team members are both Christian so the half circle on top is to represent under God. As for the two quarter circles at the bottom that is to represent me and my team mate.

4557610,0,t1_ct536su,There was a shortlived local RHop service around here where the technician used Modify flat nubs. Apparently he never tested his work and thus never saw that the Modify nub even with hop all the way off caused pinch jams super quickly with the massive pressure on the patch nearly covering half the initial barrel diameter. One bb would be stuck in the patch with another behind it breaking nozzles killing rhops and warping and scraping the inner barrel and barrel window. The first BB would essentially tear the patch and the back pressure would cause it to nick the lower part of the front of the barrel window with the second BB getting jammed in the sunken destroyed patch and often warping the window completely in the process.

4609323,0,t3_3e52b3,You probably have a dumb smart charger then unless the terms have changed on me.By this I mean that you plug it in the charger charges until the batteries show full and then the charger switches over to a trickle charge mode.  Think of it like a keep alive charge where it constantly barely charge the batteries.  Keep in mind this does not hurt the batteries at all but it can hurt your power bill if you forget about it for an extended amount of time.If you have a legit smart charger it should come with a display of some kind.  This display will let you select which battery type NiCd NiMH LiPO etc etc as well as charge rate .  . Ah.  These chargers give the user a much higher degree of control over the charge rate of their batteries and lets them either melt or charge the battery adequately. For example I own a .V mAh battery.  Since I used to fly model airplanes I also posses a Turnigy Accucell  charger.  This allows me to charge my battery at . Ah  of mAh rating  while slow a very safe charge rate for NiMH batteries until it beeps incessantly at me which means its done or it hit its  hour cutoff timer.  Other chargers Ive owned would have me plug the battery in at night and itd be done in the morning.There is nothing wrong with the charger you have.  It more than likely reverts to a trickle state which wont hurt your battery.BTW a short circuit in an electrical system means the electricity is bypassing the supposed load in the circuit light bulb TV or motor in this case.  This causes the wire to heat up and can cause a fire.  If your battery is shorting get rid of it immediately.,airsoft,ctbl6o5,2,t5_2qi2x

The other team was staying at range so as the numbers dwindled on both sides I thought it would be better to move up in the row of cover.I run as fast as I could and throw myself safely behind the next cover. All of the sudden my arms and legs started to sting. The whole field had nettles. I was in quite some pain and with low ammo I was debating on calling myself out or staying. From the place I was I noticed someones back sticking out from cover. I took aim to the side of the cover. Now this being the TM Mk a NBB and me never shooting while under stress the first shot flew really high the second went past his side the third was also way off but the fourth went right into the guy.

4735341,0,t3_3fprd8,If you like your multicam Gs you can use them. FSB has been seen wearing them in multiple ops. You just have to buy the right armor setup.Russian FSB operatives usually wear an armor carrier with something over it. For example a Defender  SemiMolle with an SRVV Modular Vest V over it or a TT MK. ToySoldier is coming out with a GladiatorC platecarrier replica soon so keep your eyes out for that itll be a limited production run.As for headgear it depends on what weight per say youre looking to carry. If youre doing armor and a chestrig viable modern FSB options include the RBR MKII helmet and the Fort Kiver RSP helmet. If youre going light just pick up a berezka boonie.Make sure to get an AKM with Zenit furnishing and rails as well.This kit will be EXPENSIVE. Itll also take some research. My advice would be to PM me before you buy anything as a lot of sites like Grey shop false advertise.Go ahead and set up an account on Red Alliance and browse their gear pics for something you like.

However you do NOT need a license on MURSFRS channels so I would recommend sticking to those. Just beware on FRS do not transmit over  watt or the FCC will find you. Transmitting  watts on FRS is a sure way to get a hefty fine andor jail time.On the off chance you have a GMRS license you can transmit up to  watts on those Even though the uvr only goes up to  watts,airsoft,cu6j0vr,2,t5_2qi2x

They also have shitty audio and problems with lower light levels. Also has the stupid fisheye problem that needs correcting post capture.On the other hand the view is centered which can make for better video on occasion if you have your camera mounted on the right side but you are leaning out left. They also have good video capture options in terms of resolution  FPS.I prefer contours because they are mounted to the side which keeps my NVG mount clear so I can use my NVGs. But why do you use a camera at night how can you see? IR sensitive lenses by ragecams! Further its easier to cut out a lot of the standing around by sliding the onoff. Although this can be bad because if you forget to turn it on you can miss cool things.If I had the money I would try a drift HD but I cant justify another action camera purchase when I have one.,airsoft,cudpyal,-1,t5_2qi2x

I may be a bit sadistic but I want them to struggle with ammo for a while.Once they get their hands on the supply Planning on  or  bags of . bb per team on resupply plus  bonus bag on an objective. theyll be able to rerload more frequentlyAbout the villagers your idea is nice. although id say if they KNOW you fired the weapon like youre the only one around they can shoot. youre definitely a threat. But if you killed an alone dude he cant shoot you after that based on the fact that you shot him a while ago.Im gonna think about letting the villagers bear arms. Last time I tried much shorter scale  people total and .hours villagers had a pistol could fire it but not point it towards the TF in any circumstances.Thats how they recognized a threat.Im gonna talk with my mate who help me and well see where it goes.thanks for the feedback buddy ,airsoft,cuo9723,2,t5_2qi2x

The radio exchange is from   . After that we cross the field and skirt around it using the treeline as concealment to stalk up to the enemy command post. Nothing much to see after  except for me almost peeing on camera at the end whoops.SECOND VIDEOThe second video is the most entertaining. At the  minute mark until the  minute mark you see the fight and the climax of our four hour stalk up to the enemy position we find in the first video.We were sneaking up to them using the road and then an enemy popped out. We melted into the sides of the road and waited until we were spotted and started our attack and wiped the floor with the enemy. It honestly felt like we were in a movie!You can see all the dudes we killed at  and how salty they are that we were out of bounds on the road that they were using.,airsoft,cvhnxqz,1,t5_2qi2x

5292343,0,t1_cvnofau,their original function prior to burst was for switch protection. switch contacts are not meant to have  volts running through them so they are in place to act as a relay rather than the main distributor of power.When the mosfet senses the switch close you squueze the trigger it directly feeds the motor power rather than the power running all that current through the switch.now they have the added benefit of the better mosfest having low discharge protection for lipos and programmable bust and nozzle reset features,airsoft,cvo5pta,1,t5_2qi2x

This can be mitigated to a degree by using component paints outside or inside with an airsupply respirator only that shit will ruin your lungs in a heartbeat and a component clearcoat but those are typically outside the realm of your regular hobbyist painter.

5356185,0,t1_cvwa84y,Yes but at that point everyones going to complain and say wtf do i need to go through all this BS to get a fake gun when its way easier to get a real one...I may be wrong but it seems like to be eligible to purchase an airsoft rifle you must first play rental  times within two months then you will be eligible to purchase an airsoft rifle. Not to mention that is only if your field is UKARA registered.I see quite a few issues with that.  The USA is very spread out compared to the UK. For instance in my area I may have  fields but I know in a lot of areas they may not have one at all. That would mean they are immediatly unable to purchase any airsoft rifles. Next theres the cost. In my area out of the  airsoft fields that are near here. I spoke to one of the owners and he said his profit is maybe k a month. With that the field is understaffed as is and it can be hard to get the attention of someone at the desk as they have to work hard. To increase there work load would require  if not more additional employees to track and keep records for them. That  additional person could eat up the rest of the profit.I mean its a system that would only work in a highly populated dense area. You have to realize that no mater where you are in the UK your like  hours from Manchester. It helps to be close when your trying to make something like that work as well as work with the government. For instance the airsoft style of the west coast maybe drastically different then the east coast style. The east coast airsoft fields may not want to co operate with the west coast rules simply because we have way less problems then they do as well as we do not have the same lawsrules. Do to not having the same lawsrules why should east coast fields take on the added cost when it does nothing for their players?,airsoft,cvwbacy,1,t5_2qi2x

The more you tinker with it the more tricks youll learn to get it back together.  For example you can bend the spring on your antireversal latch to a sweet spot where it doesnt keep pushing itself out of alignment when youre putting the shell back together but it will still function when its closed.  Once I figured that out it made the whole thing a hell of a lot easier.  Maybe you can do something similar with your trigger... or even replace the trigger with one that has a longer axle on it so it doesnt wiggle as much?  Just some ideas.  Glad you got it back together though.,airsoft,cwxmzym,7,t5_2qi2x

Whether you want to run LiPos or NiMH is up to you.Like NATO said you can run either midcaps or high caps. I run high caps because they are cheaper and you can carry a little more on you than mids. Again up to you.For your gun if it does shoot in the neighborhood of  it might be worthwhile to invest in some .s because they can help to stabilize flight in windy conditions.A gun bag isnt entirely necessary but it is a nice upgrade over the stock box. They will have pockets on the outside to hold your mags and batteries and the inside is padded to protect your gun. Grips optics and lasers are a fun addition to your loadout but it isnt entirely necessary. If you do plan to use an optic protect it with a lens protector  dollars on amazonOne note on face protection you can either run a full face cover mask OR a mesh mask and goggles.

Most likely the majority of them will keep a roll of orange tape next to all their pointofsale stations and just tape up every gun as they are sold.I cant imagine a need to have to blow out existing inventory considering how the law is written.All the big airsoft stores in California were involved in fighting this bill and had input into the language so the portion pertaining to caliber is pretty much a dead end when it comes to legal challenges. There was a lot more that went on behind the scenes than airsofters realizes but its not my place to disclose the details. As stupid as this law is its actually a win for airsoft in California with the way its written.

The TM UZI is a really interesting design but its just not made well enough nor sufficiently supported to compensate.The KWC on the other hand can be had with a full metal kit that isnt that expensive and is extremely rugged. You may even be able to fuck with it enough to Dprint a conversion box for it so that it takes a solenoid gearbox replacement and TM magazines like youre hoping to do with the TM.Regardless of which you choose its going to be expensive.  is not a particularly excessive amount to pay for a completely custom gun.,airsoft,cxwdc8m,0,t5_2qi2x

Let me make this clear there is no airsoft gun stock that could ever be considered a DMR.Barrel length is shockingly insignificant when it comes to AEGs. The optimal length for a standard AEG piston is AKM length. There will be little to no differences between an M and an M.Some guns like the Real Sword and CYMA Dragunovs have longer pistons to take advantage of the longer barrel.But still a tight bore barrel and a better hop up make all the difference.,airsoft,cz0n68d,2,t5_2qi2x

6281960,0,t3_41my7w,To me there are two schools of thought when it comes to upgrades. Firstly lets assume that nothing is currently broken and the guns are working as intended. You can either use the guns until something breaks which happens eventually on any aeg or upgrade first potentially delaying any failures.Now what do YOU want out of the gun? Are you happy with the performance? Do you feel that you need more fps range accuracy or rps? If not then theres no need to upgrade. Any part of any aeg will go bad sooner or later may as well use it until then. Dont replace the motor just because it might go bad. Replace it if it breaks or if you are unhappy with its performance. Now there are some things you can do to help that dont really involve buying a bunch of new parts. Mainly shim the gears and correct the aoe. There are tons of guides on how to do that. Other super simple things to do would be to perfect the compression and get a new hop up bucking.,airsoft,cz3oske,2,t5_2qi2x

6431915,0,t3_43sfcy,Alright first off stick a long thin screw driver or something of the sort through the nozzle and onto the piston head and try to compress the piston back by hand. If its binding or getting caught towards the rear the piston may be too thick or the upper gearbox may have some casting issues in which case tend to that ofc. If you can compress it without problem you have that out of the way. Second swap your motor out and check if thats the issue. While your motor is out check the gear shimming this could also be a symptom of extremely tight shimming but I doubt that. Third and most importantly check your trigger contacts and cut off lever. If your contacts are charred or your cut off is warped or acting strangely and cutting off too soon swap those parts out immediately. ,airsoft,czkljt5,3,t5_2qi2x

And hop technology has improved to match or surpass what PTWs had with their system and regarding the well known electronics again there is aftermarket parts available to match that.So for much less money and even possibly using standard AEG base and AEG mags you can get some or most of the same features if you dont need the  body simulation and heavy weight that PTW is still sort of exclusive in offering in the AEG platform due to its unique setup all receivers electronics gearbox motor hopup unit inner barrel cylinder magazines and etc...are unique to the PTW type.,airsoft,d02dc4n,3,t5_2qi2x

6615186,0,t3_46a5as,It looks like the chart is purely mathematical. The problem with joule creep is that bascially as you increase the weight of the BB the BB absorbs more and more of the power given to it.Like this Lets pretend were in a perfect world and you have a spring thats supposed to give . BBs  FPS. That BB will then have a joule of .. Lets now increase the BB weight to . without increasing the power of the spring. Technically the BB should be slower but with the same power. According to the chart the .g BB should be traveling at a speed of around  FPS. But heres the issue. Since the BB is slower it will be able to absorb more of the power from the air that is pushing the BB. This means that the .g BB might be traveling at something like  FPS just to pull a number out of my ass. If this is the case the .g BB would have a joule of . and that can become an issue. ,airsoft,d03keqg,1,t5_2qi2x

Slide just the piston into the cylinder window onto the rails to see if it slides in and out.  There should be no resistance either way.  If you encounter resistance the piston is the problem.

You thus get a high joule output without needing a stiff bolt pull and you dont have to worry about external air.The minute people see HPACO regulators they automatically label you as a HPA guy and treat you accordingly. Its a stereotype that isnt desired. Its easier to show up with a springer make people overlook you and then pull of shots that even the best HPA builds would envy.People forget that its not the air delivery system that gives you range and precision.,airsoft,d0f08a0,1,t5_2qi2x

6789279,0,t3_48qtb5,I wouldnt go for a co pistol like the Taurus mentioned earlier for two reasons cost and fps. Since these are just for casual play with friends Im guessing you dont want to worry about buying CO cartridges every time you play. Also since youll be playing in close quarters the high FPS of co pistols could potentially break skin. My personal recommendation would either be spring trishots shotguns that shoot three bbs per pump the M on Evike is exactly . Great for close quarters decent range and if you choose to get more into airsofting you can buy more shotgun shells. Other guns that could work are gas nonblowback pistols like the YampampP MK runs off green gaspropane still a hassle or a quality AEP automatic electric pistol like the CYMA GC. For wholesale check out globeproductsupply.comThey have the CYMA GC and probably have trishots too. Check out the galaxy mps if youre willing to expand your budget. ,airsoft,d0luptz,4,t5_2qi2x

I have at this point disassembled and reassembled it  times. I have replaced the air nozzle with one with an oring shimmed the gearbox. I used the method in which you first shim all the gears to the gearbox then shimmed the first gear I still dont know all the names to the motor and then the second gear to the first ect. Everything there seems great.I did change the motor grip to a magpul before shimming once again everything seems correct there. I then cleaned and tried to make sure everything was lubed correctly seems good currently.The problem I am having is that the gun currently shoots great  fps with a .g bb no feed issues but my hop up seems to do nothing when I adjust it. The bb travels like the hop up is adjust to low curves downward adjusting the hop up seems to have no effect until it finally makes the bb travel with a significant down curve. I did not change the hopup that comes standard with the krytac spr.Being a crazy man I am my first airsoft gun and the first thing I did was take it apart and break it  my next plan is to flat hop and then use the zkit ir hop up kit as it looks to be the easiest way to make a good hop up setup.

But in the real swords case the blued coating is very thin which means if you do not routinely oil the entire body of the gun it WILL rust.  You also have to modify mags to work with it and next to nothing aftermarket is compatible.  The gearbox is some weird zinc alloy that will eventually crumble no shit like ceramic or something and youll have to buy another RS gearbox to replace it because nothing else fits.The EampL has a more attractive and resilient finish along with wide compatibility and honestly a more solid external build than the Real Sword.  ,airsoft,d14zrgx,2,t5_2qi2x

The only fogproof solution is contact lenses everything else is a halfmeasure that wont work well. It sounds like you didnt try to wear your glasses under goggles so you dont know if theyll fog or not. If you have your paintball mask try putting your glasses under it going for a quick jog and then standing still. If your glasses dont fog youre probably in the clear. If they fog  youll see the problem.The point is dont bet on wearing glasses under goggles as an effective way to play. Most people whove tried the various options will strongly recommend you wear contact lenses.,airsoft,d16yigh,1,t5_2qi2x

7014817,0,t3_4bpidk,Both are good choices and as uFerrard gave some thoughts Id want to throw in some of my own input..  The GampG SR series are one of their newest releases and has a lot of useful features right out of the factory condition.Internally it has their ETU microswitch system a basic MOSFET with blade fuse assembly and a slightly better motor than older releases.  It has GampGs reputable level of decent internal quality.Externally it has an ergonomic pistol grip adjustable stock with beefy buttstock pad flipup iron sights and the Keymod handguard gives you a lot of accessories options.  So being an M with these tactical accessories you immediately have a lot of customization options or you can even run it asis.In summary you get a lot of features right out of the factory configuration that are useful and its a recent release so it incorporates some newer technology from a reputable brand..  The CYMA CM. is a lot of different firstly obviously being an AK type and secondly being a more classic type of rifle without a lot more modern furnishings.  A lot of people get the CM. or CM.M series because they like the more classic AK look of wood furniture. Its also all metal and wood so it feels hefty which some people like for the realism feel.Internally though QC varies these higherpriced CYMA AK models are well known for lasting a long time.  Newer ones have a fairly strong motor and the air seal is sometimes very good with a lot of people reporting a high FPS number out of the box.  A lot of people run stock CYMA AKs without ever a tuneup or maintenance and they still run strong for some reason.  The wellknown Brill of Brill Armory says CYMA stock pistons are pretty damn strong.And if you desire you can still fully change out the look of the CM. with all modern furniture replacements if you know where to look around for the right partsIn summary you get a great alternative to the M platform that is known for its toughness works great for a classic look but also could be fully decked out if desired.  It does not have proprietary parts so you could have it upgraded internally if you desire as well to keep it running longer and better.,airsoft,d1bh7ib,2,t5_2qi2x

7023792,0,t1_d1cg88z,Well it can be one of two things. A most likely its a rubber knife. In airsoft melee kills are allowed and are done so by using a rubber knife to slash swipe across the player no stabbing enemy players. In field games its not all that likely it will happen while in CQB games its a common possibility two players might be close enough range to warrant a use of a rubber knife. OrB Not very likely its a real knife in which hopefully the player is not a fucking psycho idiot better be away from his main kit in a pouch that is not easily accessible and cannot be confused with a rubber knife. It can be useful in certain situations such as gear caught medical emergencies or any other various survival reasons if the situation ever deems it  necessary. Although while I wish most players are smart and just sticking to rubber knifes I had heard of one case where a player had a real knife within reach and another player had grabbed it off him assuming it was fake and held at him again assuming it was fake until he realized it wasnt a fake. The situation was quickly rectified fake and real knives were sorted out and no one was injured. So I see your reason for concern. You cant stop all the idiots. But for the most part you try and assume everyone knows what theyre doing. ,airsoft,d1chyoj,1,t5_2qi2x

So if you are trigger happy youll need more batteries.For you I would buy three of those. That way if one is a dud you have two still and you probably wont need more than two for a day at the field.

7088053,0,t1_d1jrfl7,gt This is a really shit review. Visually identical yes. Actually identical?Are you familiar with Occams razor? Consider which is more likely. Echo who exist solely to rebrand other peoples guns rebrand the AY VSS exactly as they have rebranded CYMAs AKs VFCs XCRs and ARs JGs Gs and ARs AampKs Ms etc. or. Echo who have no design or production facilities of their own have somehow suddenly designed and manufactured a VSS and VAL two rare guns before the sudden glut post that is literally identical inside and out to the AY VSS and VAL.It is the same gun Google will show you many more indepth examples of how they are identical guns sharing the same parts. Im sorry I dont have a more detailed breakdown for you where someone literally strips two of the guns apart to compare but thats because its not necessary. Everyone knows that the Echo is a rebrand of the AY people dont bother documenting things that are common knowledge. If you Google Echo IGOR rebrand youll be able to see thousands of people acknowledging this fact.gt Yeah thats not a review thats an opinionated secondhand editorial piece shitting on the Echo  VSS because its not exactly identical to the real steel.Its not intended to be a review its a hitpiece highlighting several areas which RusFOR airsofters were very unhappy with. If you want a review look around Booligan did one. Saying the gun isnt exactly identical to the real steel is a complete copout its a bad replica of the VSSVAL. In addition to being generally the wrong shape and being made of the wrong materials its missing the fire selector. Thats pretty fundamental for most people.gt And I really dont care if its not an exact replica or even inaccurate in a few key aspects.Bully for you! The prevailing view of rairsoft and the overwhelming majority of RusFOR airsofters in particular is that the AYs aesthetic shortcomings are much worse than other comparably priced guns and that it is by far the least desirable VSSVAL on the market. I happen to agree with them an equivalent CYMA is much closer to the model its replicating than the AY is to the VSSVAL and the LCT VSS and VAL are much more desirable without being insanely expensive so if you want a good VSSVAL you have options.gt You cannot get a real steel CYMA AK. Youll get a metal one. Pot metal in most places. Again at  its a good buy. Unique look good performance good externals.AFAIK all of CYMAs VFC clones have a mostly steel receiver Im not sure whether any of their TM clones do. Either way there is significantly more steel in a CYMA than in the entirely potmetal AY.You are entitled to think that the AY is unique with good performance and externals just like I am entitled to hold the opinion that its buttugly cheaply made and disappointing in performance compared to similarly priced and much more popular CYMA AKs. Most airsofters want a close replica of a real firearm which is why very few truly fictional guns e.g. APS UAR are successful and why the IGOR is not very successful. Agree? Great there are good alternatives that are closer replicas of real firearms. You dont agree? Great you can benefit by buying this gun for barely half its original MSRP.,airsoft,d1jsrin,2,t5_2qi2x

7385998,0,t3_4ggz8g,i used to build bouncing betties when i was younger but then i moved and none of my new fields allowed mines so i stopped. if you want a simpler reusable and safer method of deploying the bbs i have one. it is the same method that the airsoft claymores work on. two spring loaded arms that open in opposite directions with a sheet of fabric in between them. unfortunately this process is patented so you cant sell your betties commercially but i doubt they will raise a fuss unless you start making bank off this in which case i want a cut too!!!!for the bouncing betties i used a x wood plank cut it  deep so i had a xx block. thats the core. then you need  rat traps pull the spring and arm from the trapbe careful as the spring will unwind slightly and can pinch your fingers then screw  springarm assemblies to the bottom half of each x side of your core being sure to rewind the springs into place so the arms open up outwards. space them about  apart so the arms overlap each other when folded. now that you have all  sides installed it is time to attach fabric between the arms. i used denim from an old par of jeans but any thick strong fabric will work. i recommend you sew it on as glues and epoxies dont really work. finally screw a . pvc cap to the top of your core. the cap should hang just above the arms so it is not in they way of the bbs flying outward.i used a . piece of pvc as a base for the mine. cap one end and screw a x wooden dowel inside the cap this acts as a guide for the spring you will use to launch the betty slide your springs over the dowel i used  toilet paper tube springs superglued together and put a bolt at the end to keep the spring from flying off the dowel. then you attach about . feet of lbs fishing line to the end.next you use another piece of pvc with a cap on one end this time . as a sleeve for the core. drill a hole in the cap so the spring guide can slide through it and attach the fishing line from the base to the top of the cap so that when loaded the sleeve cap and string face down and slides into the base.now drill a hole in the bottom of the core so the spring guide can fit in it as well. then attach a second piece of fishing line about  to the bottom of the core and the inside of the sleeve.finally drill  small holes around the  sides of the core cap and the base pipe so that the holes line up with one another.when all is said and done you load all  pieces of fabric with bbs and fold the arms closed. then slide the core into the sleeve. next the sleeve is slid into the base plate compressing the spring and you stick bolts in the  outer holes on the cap locking the whole thing together for transport.when you set the mine up simply dig a small hole place the mine in the hole so the cap is flush with the ground carefully pull the bolts out and replace them with a small stick one at a time  i have found wooden kabob skewers to work exceptionally well. spread some leaves over it and you are done!when a player steps on the cap it forces the mine down inside the base snapping the sticks locking it in place. when they step off of it the spring launches the sleeve and core up.  the fishing line catches and the sleeve stops moving but the core continues on releasing the arms of the mine and throwing bbs in all direction.  finally the line attaching the core to the sleeve catches keeping your core from getting lost. all in all it costs about  to make and works extremely well. in fact i tried to have it patented to sell the idea to a company but thats when i leaned about the claymores and discovered there was already a similar patent. i know this is kind of a text wall and it sounds complicated but it is really pretty simple. if you have any questions or anyone wants a how toodiy with pictures let me know and i could get the stuff to build a few new mines. maybe make a video about it or something.,airsoft,d2hqk3n,3,t5_2qi2x

8048777,0,t1_d4kjthz,Okay. So for the trigger it sounds like you are having an electrical issue of some sort. The intermittent failure makes me think it has something to do with the trigger contacts. You can install a simple MOSFET to bypass this issue or try and repair the contacts. Possible failure points include Dirty trigger contacts or trigger shuttleWorn out trigger shuttle contacts making contact with the selector plate are not meeting well they need to be bent outwards to make better contact.What kindof batteries are you using? What connector?For accuracy and range try out some barrel and bucking combos until you find one that works for you. Some buckings that people generally say are good are GampG Green PDI WHold and Prometheus Purple. I have used all e in various setups with success. For barrels I have used Madbull tightbores PDI tightbores Raven barrels work but the Stainless barrels are nicer and KM Head barrels with success. Maple leaf Barrels are supposed to be good limited experience with them and everyone here keeps saying ZCI barrels are good but I have never used one or seen one used on a local field to my knowledge. ,airsoft,d4kratb,2,t5_2qi2x

8341749,0,t3_4tso7l, I build all of my weapons from the ground up. I am out of touch with stock guns from personal experience. From what I have been hearing from friends recently GampG Top Tech and Krytac come highly recommended. Any weapon from either line should be fine. VFC GBBRs are really hit and miss from what I have heardseen. You probably will be able to find basic upgrades for them barrel bucking grip stock rail? but not much else. I think. Double check with google. For OEM parts there should be decent availability through larger retailers. The WE Tech rifles are becoming more and more supported through RA Tech and other companies angry gun maple leaf. If there isnt a full line of upgrades for the WE SCAR H already the parts will probably all be available within  years. WE used to be terrible quality wise but they have really stepped up their game and they fix issues with their guns when they make a new run. VFC I have heard time andtime again good externals internals are hit and miss. Sometimes they work amazing forever other times they lemon out of the box. I just got a VFC SCAR SSR AEG and I basically plan on upgrading the motor gears and wiring out of the box to make it field worthy. For recoil a NPAS can direct more gas toward recoil and a heavy recoil kit will help. Also using a higher pressure gas or improving seals can help too. It is up to you if it is worth the effort or not.  Lube the GBBR before every game day. Clean them every other game day at least depending on how much you use them. Treat them well andyou will have fun.Also remember that every time you take a GBBR onto a field you are intentionally handicapping yourself. Dont get mad if people dont call their hits it will happen. You are using a GBBR for YOU to have fun. No other reason. If it isnt fun on a particular day grab an AEG and keep playing. ,airsoft,d5k9tr9,4,t5_2qi2x

8541533,0,t3_4wq1i9,Went to SC Village on Saturday for their morning to afternoon games.Rose playing a mega game which combines two fields and alpha and bravo players alpha being more Advanced players so its objective based and my team had to get two bombs into a supply truck near the enemy spawn. Best part about this game was the team work I had with the  guys that were willing to actually coordinate a plan. Unfortunately we werent able to complete the objective but its always loads of fun when you have a team working together.Thorn This didnt happen to me and I didnt see it but the p guys mostly dudes under  were having their own set of games. While waiting for the regular games a couple of dudes from the p group came running out looking scared as shit. I overheard one of the guys talking to the ref about a kid being lit up with a p and another dude running off. From what I could gather is that the shooter ran away but they do know who he is and hes pretty much banned.Kinda sucks that people like this are giving p a bad name because I kind of want to get one.Bud looking forward to switching out my spring and getting near the field limit and being able to get a straight shot across the map as well as my next time out ,airsoft,d699dzc,2,t5_2qi2x

8557383,0,t1_d6ab510,Youre correct that the ability to interpret is huge and bestows a lot of power but the ATF is still constrained by the law itself.Further their opinion on interpretation does not automatically grant such opinion legitimacy but upon court determination of such. They dont get to define the phrase. They can interpret it until such court decides to accept or reject the given definition.As to the actual lawgt The term firearm means A any weapon including a starter gun which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive B the frame or receiver of any such weapon C any firearm muffler or firearm silencer or D any destructive device.In sub A its clear that a weapon even if it wasnt able to or designed to fire a bullet is still considered a firearm if readily converted to do so.Sub B provides that the frame of any such weapon in sub A is a firearm. So you have bframes or receivers of weapons that shoot bullets and aweapons that may be readily converted to shoot bullets can be considered as firearms. So the scope of what a firearm is isnt just what it can do but what it can potentially do in the future after modification. However in sub B the definition of firearm only includes items that are currently frames or receivers. It doesnt include objects that could be frames or receivers in the future.In the text  types of weapons are firearms. Those that can shoot bullets those that are meant to shoot bullets and those that can be readily converted to shoot bullets.You must note that the readily converted standard only applies to weapons however. If the original item was never a weapon nor intended to be a weapon the readily converted standard does not apply to it. ,airsoft,d6b8yn0,1,t5_2qi2x

Its been two months and hes now going to great lengths to avoid paying up.

Theres also holographics but those cost around  and even replicas cost a lot.

9045738,0,t1_d7z1cpe,Eh prefiring is kind of a dick move. Just because you know an enemy is there doesnt mean you know if theres a dead player walking throughstanding there a ref standing there or if the player is being a major dumbass and took off his goggles to wipe off sweat.  Not that Id blame you for his loss of sight but preventing incidents is always nice.Not really sure how you expect someone to be able to hold their fire if they spot an unsafe target while firing close enough to the corner to eliminate an enemy without the moment of surprise.  Its one or the other.  The moment of surprise is you processing what your target is.  If you are shooting without that youre not properly IDing your target before shooting which is pretty close to blindfiring.Its not  blindfiring but at the minimum Id say its unsportsmanlike.  Maybe if you peeked your head into a room with only one entrance and saw that one guy it might be okay but IMO its too situational to be a goto tactic.,airsoft,d7z5isd,1,t5_2qi2x

No sense in paying for a purple or even a green when all you need is airseal.  As far as nubs you can cut your own from an eraser or get a modify flat hop nub that will allow you to go back to a standard hop up if you want.

9322850,0,t1_d8xpzsx,While not the problem it certain contributes.Without any sort of detection implementation the release of the piston will not always be at the  o clock release point.  Part of this can be mitigated by not releasing the trigger until the gearbox cycle has been completed during semi auto fire.Anyhow the point is the piston will not always be in the forward most position ready to be pulled back after every shot.  It will vary sometimes being in the correct forward most or sometimes in the rear most position.  That rear most position is where your lockup most likely occurs because it needs more amperage to turn over the gearbox at this position as opposed to the forward most.I tend to shove the largest amperage battery typically a lipo I can get as well as a high torque motor into my builds.  This helps my troubleshooting as the only remaining part to troubleshoot is really the drivetrain the gearboxEdit for clarity I dont particular mind the nonmilspec look so I do run an external battery bag on my crane stock setup.

I signed up for an event at Fort Ord here in California and picked Green team since Mandrake is a woodland pattern. Long story short I was told it was multicam and that Id need to switch teams. I was annoyed with the decision and was concerned that Id be TKd or accused of teamswitching so I just asked for a refund. Its a shame too since I saw footage of the site and was excited to go.

9848609,0,t1_dar9kvw,gtHaving the plastic lower receivers on two pistols blow up made them beyond repair. See this is what is a bit unbelievable. These are the types of breakages where most would look at the broken gun in their hand and say to themselves I shouldnt have done that while doing something ridiculous like putting a significantly higher pressure gas than what it is capable of using. Show some proof Im genuinely interested in seeing this. gtI have a fair bit of experience with gun internals enough to disassemble the apache right down to the last screws and pins in the upper and lower. As have I. In fact Ive got my trusty Apache right next to me. gtI have replaced every major part in the apache at least once including multiple barrels and hop up units buckings flatrhops nozzles bolts piston heads trigger units springs etc. Stock WE inner barrels and buckings are unique. They use shorter windows with larger nubs on the buckings thus making them incompatible with standard old style WEVSR buckings and barrels unless you replace both. The fact youve replaced the hopup assembly parts so drastically means youve either gotten a major lemon for a hopup unit something which couldve been fixed with a new hopup unit had it actually been the case or more likely user error.I havent used the Z Parts trigger assembly myself especially considering none of my stock parts had broken after several thousand bbs though Ive had experience with their other parts and have brought nothing but issues to the guns theyve been installed in which also leads me to believe the parts you were installing only damaged things further.

Full of adrenalin right? Branches are covering up his face HD clear protection glasses are common. The second guy was not facing Novritch. His scope might not have the same zoom as his scopecam. I dont know what to say to you except I think you are wrong. Taking off your eye pro during a game while inside of the game zone does not make you a victim it makes you dumb. I cant really respond to your last sentence I dont understand it. You want Novritch to emergency stop the game for something he didnt know was going on or are you saying that the guy without eye pro was even dumber for not responding to it and not even put his glasses on?EDIT Now that I think about it we can actually try to get him here to hear his side of the story. unovritsch Tell us about this.,airsoft,db5b11k,1,t5_2qi2x

Make sure he has eye protection! Instead of getting him an electric gun maybe try a bolt action style rifle. Its suitable for a cabin looks like a hunting rifle instead of a military weapon. But you can always go with the reliable gampg ma which is cheap battery powered fun and durable. Its basically the honday civic of airsoft.Keep in mind he needs bbs to play with the gun as well as a battery. They sell kits that include all the things he needs to get started and have fun.With this he will get everything he needs to play and be safe. Goggles are a must and I personally would spend the extra money to make sure he has all the neccessary equipment to not get injured and to have the gun work out of the box. It comes with bbs the gun a gun bag to store the weapon safely eye protection and a battery. Its a reliable gun. And wont need to purchase another gun in quite some time.,airsoft,db9gej5,1,t5_2qi2x

10079100,0,t1_dbkwa1b,It depends on how much you want to put into it. There are several options the best known is Magento. If you do use Magento I suggest staying away from .x. Another option is Woocommerce which runs on top of WordPress. The issue with that one is its WordPress which has a vulnerability in every version. Its easy to use but you have to be sure that you update Woocommerce when WordPress updates or it might break after an autoupdate.There are several other CMS that you can use such as osCommerce or PrestaShop but they dont have as much support as the other two.Another option is Shopify. They manage basically everything you just add your products and images. Ive seen a few people switch to Shopify from Magento and come back after a few months because they cant do one thing or another.Ultimately what youre going to want to look for in a CMS is ease of use and support availability. With your hosting company youre going to want high quality support and if youre going to accept credit cards through a payment gateway PCI compliance assistance.

From FES Division Sent Wednesday July    AM To infoblankfiringgrenade.com Subject RE help required pleaseOur Firearms Technology Branch FTB evaluated these before. The evaluation of both samples determined that neither were designed nor redesigned as a weapon. Further both are designed or redesigned for use as signaling pyrotechnic safety or similar such device. Also both are not likely to be used as a weapon.. Accordingly FTB finds that both the Blank Firing Grenade and the Blank Firing Impact Grenade are suitable for importation.However FTB has determined that the submitted samples come under the Arms Export Control Act of  AECA classification for grenades. Consequently these items must be imported using a Form  and the importer must be registered under the AECA. However since they are not firearms as soon as the practice grenades are imported they may be sold as is and do not need to be transferred as firearms.We can only register Form . and approve Form .A for a U.S. citizen or resident. So you will have to find a U.S. citizen or resident to go into business and import your products after they are register as an importer.Further a police department need only to submit the Form.A along with a purchase order to import these.Marie PollardIndustry Operations SpecialistBureau of ATFampEF amp E Imports Branch Needy RoadMartinsburg WV office  FAX EMail Marie.Pollardusdoj.govIs the letter concerning the VTG The letter posted in that thread just applies to if it is a destructive device and does not talk about importation and no samples were submitted for approval or rejection unlike the VTG letter.   ,airsoft,dbpx8zl,1,t5_2qi2x

10247848,0,t1_dc5ieki,The rules are that you call hit when a BB strikes you so you dont have confirmation you have hit until that happens. So actually the way to look at this is you have to keep shooting until a hit is registered because that is the rules its just obnoxious to be calling other people out.I have seen these situations so often from the otherside where the BBs are off centre or falling short a few metres these arent bullets they are not accurate and we wear a bundle of gear that can make it difficult to feel some hits.Stop assuming everyone is cheating and reframe how you look at the game if all the proof you have is your shooting and he isnt calling hit then its not enough to call him a cheater.Please change your attitude.,airsoft,dc5nf5n,4,t5_2qi2x
10249221,0,t1_dc5oypw,Not op but I do own a QRS. So on the handle that you pull to change the stock position there are two pins.

The people I played with hated me lolThe Gen  is just like the Gen  but much higher out of the box fps and totally different bolt and cylinder. A big drawback is modifying it  as I dont think most upgrades will work with it? I could be totally wrong.

10846419,0,t1_ddyobs2,Wide bores are good with HPA systems because HPA systems can run them effectively by being able to push enough air down the barrel for them to have their cushion effect while maintaining a good FPS. You could do that with a elongated piston or a few other mods in an AEG but a HPA setup can be tuned better for a widebore than a AEG  of the time. So you will hear people saying that wide bores are better for HPA and this is true but saying HPA setups are better with a widebore than they are with a tightbore is not true.I decided on a tightbore since ORGA is really the only wide bore I would consider and they are expensive and only brass. Prommy PDI or EdGI are all steel and polished to a better finish than an ORGA for cheaper except the EdGI. Also in a potentially automatic build a tightbore will be quieter and more air efficient which is a big deal for me!. So TBB was the obvious choice and is more proven.TLDR  TBB and WBB are equal for HPA but TBB are more air efficient which is bueno for HPA. WBB can be run in AEGs but with modifications or FPS loss.,airsoft,ddyqcyc,2,t5_2qi2x

Ive seen a ton of cringe moments a guy considered himself the airsoft police and went out and bought a fake police badge to wear around on his belt along with his patched jackets and hat. He even called himself Sarge and got that on a custom license plate for his truck bought a army issue rucksack to haul his gear in which he never plays  of the time then tried to convince me and a few buddies who are active service army that he was a sergeant in the army. Spoiler alert he never even went to basic. So good job trying to convince players that your sweet buddy.Another kid age  I believe spends all of his money on high end gear and systema guns. Came to the field one day saying he was on the ISIS kill list. Then proceeds to show us his new reload and how its so much faster hes also overweight and probably could run more than a m with plates in. Keep it on the field guys your not sweet. Also my favourite wtf moment was a guy posted a picture into a buysell group of a black combat shirt super worn and shitty draped over the back of his couch. In the background you can see black garbage bags full of McDonalds and fast food drink cups and full filth strewn throughout the place. Kinda disgusting.

Inspect the wiring and make sure everything is connected and theres no loose or weak spots. Finally check the gearbox as it might be locked up. If it is locked up its most likely the antireversal latch and you will just need to reset everything.

I could get my printer to print this with PLAABSPETG and have minimal cleanup. Like Muffin said you can go SLA but your range of engineering grade materials isnt great and cleanup is arguably more annoying...gotta clean off the resin dip in IPA post cure in UV if its still soft etc. FDM is cheaper to use and maintain. You can minimize post processing by spending time dialing in your printer. There are some that print super well out of the box but cost more.

11726338,0,t3_675g63,Ive painted a few of my own and am getting ready to paint more for my group. Here was my firstA little advice If you dont have experience look up tutorials and practice on something other than your gun. Work patiently and in light coats if you rush youll handle wet paint or end up with runs. If you want to protect it use a clear coat when its done. If you dont want it shiny matte clear coats are worth it.  Pick a quality paint that says it works for the material youre using it on. Aka  plasticmetalwhatever safe. Most people use Rustoleum or Krylon. GUT YOUR GUN! Dont gunk up your internals with paint because there are areas that vent into the gun. GBBs can be stripped and painted like real steel in most cases. If you dont do this you could ruin your gun if youre not careful. I dont recommend painting with internals still in the gun.  Be absolutely sure you want to paint the gun and you know what youre doing before hand. You cant really completely undo a paint job. You can try your best to cover or remove it but it may never be the same.,airsoft,dgp7lnh,1,t5_2qi2x

11776952,0,t3_680sf3,If the battery is mah i charge it with . amps if its mah i charge it with . ampsi use balance once in a while if i see that voltage in cells is off if its not i use regular charge and yes balance does it both it charges and balanceshow many S your battery has is how many cells it has. you can feel that by your hand usualy how many blocks are you feeling but if its .V and each cell is .V then somethig is off with labelingand good job picking up a proper charger if you wont disscharge your lipos fully you will get a much longer life time out of them then with cheap chargers,airsoft,dguydup,1,t5_2qi2x

11789108,0,t3_685x0w,I got the SDiK ARES Striker in last week along with a MARS regulator and Ive had nothing but problems. First the needle on the regulator bent over mancraft is sending me a new one then the machining on a part of the SDiK was causing it to chew through orings causing leaks had to order a bag of  with my own money because fuck waiting  weeks for postage from Poland and finally the unit itself had a huge leak because one of the orings in the main unit failed to seal the main cylinder. All of these problems for the low prices of  CAD  shipping. I only just got the problems sorted out a week after receiving my package.I hope you wont have nearly as many problems as I have.,airsoft,dgwc2jt,1,t5_2qi2x
11791383,0,t3_687ieb,Its not bad at all if you like it keep it. If you want to have it differently try a new frame do the same thing though leave out a few parts where you dont need the extra grip.,airsoft,dgwlcvz,1,t5_2qi2x
