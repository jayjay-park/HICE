4422492,0,t1_cso2jiu,It is an oldie but a goody. That thread helped me tons in getting the game. BW really plays differently than DnDlikes. The rules support your character and their back story and support their ambitions. Backstory and character personality are not extra flavor in the game it is the game.Beliefs end up being a great GM resource as well. Since you dont look at the whole world you made and try to think of what part of the quest should run into the players. You look at their character sheets before the session you look at their beliefs and just think of ways to challenge those. ,BurningWheel,cso5er5,1,t5_2tr3t
4572322,0,t1_ct6xzsv,Really interesting. Is that under the trait vote section in the rules? I know about voting traits on or off of a character but I must have missed some part of it.,BurningWheel,ct6y961,2,t5_2tr3t
4770117,0,t1_ctvmnd8,I hadnt even thought about GenCon. As long as Im not missing anything like the fact they stopped selling them through their store or something then Im not worried.,BurningWheel,ctvtecx,2,t5_2tr3t
5373086,0,t3_3om3np,Hey hows it goin?I am much in a similar boat really want to play but no game in sight. My group has me in line for our rotation to GM a BW game... but its in like  months. I want to do some learning before then and nobody will help me out with a side game.I have the Revised edition rulebook and have a decent understanding of the game except for Fight! and DoW.Ive been wanting to organize a PbP because I thought that was my best chance and worked well for my schedule would that interest you? I would love to try to GM but Ive never played before so... might require some patience.,BurningWheel,cvyh0ef,3,t5_2tr3t
6038261,0,t1_cyb40q5,Oh I see the issue with the math. The question is how to square it with Lukes very clear statement in that post that the skilled characters successes are essentially doubled in a versus test? Also theres other comments from Luke here  such as Beginners Luck is meant to say hey just cause you dont have the skill doesnt mean youre incompetent but those Counterstrikes from the skilled character become murder... and Any time youre dealing with a double Ob penalty the unskilled person should have to generate twice as many successes as the skilled which suggest that the lethality youre noting is intentional.This question of halving versus doubling is discussed in the forums and your method comes up a lot. I get why lots of folk prefer its logic but has anyone from BWHQ ever commented that the unskilled successes are halved.Personally I dont have a problem with the unskilled blocks making the attacker more effective. Good blocks generate benefits from excess successes. An unskilled blocker is lucky if they dont open themselves up. They really should focus on Avoiding and leave the blocking to trained fighters ,BurningWheel,cyb4mvc,1,t5_2tr3t
6666225,0,t1_d08iuym,Thats something Ive been mulling over lately. The supplements arent entirely essential for new content but they do make it a lot easier to make. Im not sure exactly how Im going to handle that aspect of things but Im open to suggestions.,BurningWheel,d08ug5k,1,t5_2tr3t
6924325,0,t1_d1167ff,gtIn BW the adventure is an exploration of the PCs.This is a really good oneline summation of BW.,BurningWheel,d11738u,4,t5_2tr3t
7007367,0,t3_4bn0kq,If your characters didnt want to be poor it sounds like an oversight in the character creation process.  You have to make smart decisions to end up with decent resources and the right choices arent obvious.If your characters should be poor and they want to fix that then Id set it up as an adventure with multiple steps to success or failure including lots of quests and challenges rather than a single die roll that could be botched and then spending time trying to recover from that botch.Itll help if the players justify their quest for wealth through beliefs instincts and traits to justify some artha gains along the way.  If gaining wealth is not a major concern for the party considering its goals Id make it clear that becoming wealthy is a major undertaking that would take precious time away from their current objectives.,BurningWheel,d1amp7q,3,t5_2tr3t
7232200,0,t1_d208wfq,and gah! Just read bravetraveler saying the exact opposite  and it makes sense as well..so no idea.. take which feels best and run with it.,BurningWheel,d208xyf,1,t5_2tr3t

8786464,0,t1_d4z0c0d,For a bit more color to the excellent responses youve already received when I envision a grey weapon in a high fantasy setting its not just something belonging to a special class of weapons like Valyrian steel or Elvish bows. Theyre not even every weapon with a name and a story. Grey weapons are the stuff of myth agedefining tools wielded to do things viewed as beyond human in a world where even magic is within the grasp of man. Its not just the swords of powerful families its Excalibur whose scabbard heals the wielder of all wounds and who was bequeathed by the queen of the spirits of Avalon to the one true king. Its Narsil the blade that severed the finger of Sauron even when the Ring of Power turned all other weapons away. When one of these weapons come into being calendars reset to  and and entire wars are fought over them alone.Unless youre looking for a more pulp fantasy vibe you should be able to count the number of shaded weapons in your entire setting on your fingers. Most should be out of play either shattered into fragments from a great battle ages past sealed in a stone with a cryptic prophecy or otherwise excused from being wielded to take down entire armies alone. Perhaps most importantly everyone more than mortal in the setting should be making a point of keeping tabs on one of the handful of things in existence that can destroy them. The second the sword is pulled from the stone or the elves reforge the sacred blade clocks should start ticking and factions with grey wound bosses should be converging on whoever wields the blade unless its thrown back into the lake or entrusted once more into the care of whatever supernatural caretakers have kept it hidden.,BurningWheel,d73zc0h,1,t5_2tr3t

9747084,0,t1_dac8kt0,Considering this how hard would it be to remove the lifepath system entirely and create a point buy system instead?,BurningWheel,daejgv7,1,t5_2tr3t
9774720,0,t3_5efefo,We generally Grab as many useful LPs from the book that fit the setting with minimal changes and then reskin other LPs to match. So reskin Knight into Spaceknight. Look at all the prerequisites to see if they make sense as written then tweak resources and years up or down if the setting demands it. If Spaceknights are Jedi rebels they might have less resources and require a few more years training but get some interesting skills and traits.,BurningWheel,dahy8au,2,t5_2tr3t
10019224,0,t1_dbd22yu,Thats also a question Ive been asking myself after my first use of the Figth! system.See the rulebook page  for a more precise answer.Basically when its  vs  the solo one must target each of his action against one of his opponents except for the Avoid that works against both at the same time. You anounce your target at the same time you announce the action. Depending on the GM you can target while knowning all the announced actions or not. For the second opponent you resolve all actions as if the solo had scripted nothing. Definitely you can buy time when stuck in a v but you have to be skilled or lucky to manage both your opponents alone.,BurningWheel,dbdj7e1,2,t5_2tr3t
10098565,0,t1_dbnm0xz,Nothing should stop your character from continuing their current lifepath. But in character creation a character repeating a lifepath more than once gets diminishing returns.,BurningWheel,dbnuved,1,t5_2tr3t
10651241,0,t1_dd8lvh8,My idea for a roden campaign is the thought of a massive worldending flood brought on by the magic of the elves and men perhaps some type of war covering the world in a giant sea.  Both those races were able to save pockets of their civilizations setting up floating port cities and the like but the roden werent so lucky.  Those who lived Below were forced to the surface by the flooding possibly this would be the case for dwarves as well and those who lived in the Fields had their lives wiped out.  The few survivors of both roden groups are forced to assimilate into the surviving foreign population centers and neither group is particularly wellreceived.  Adding to this external conflict is how each group is forced to reconcile with their faith in the face of these catastrophic losses.,BurningWheel,ddeldku,1,t5_2tr3t
11641713,0,t3_664e5q,First of all Sorcery still falls under the intent and task rules as in you only roll if failure is interesting. Then you have a sorcery roll  which is open ended by default against the obstacle of the spell. Some spells marked by  have extrabetter effects if you roll higher. You also have some modified rules for quickly and patiently  you can get bonus dice up to your exponent or the spell ob whichever is lower at the cost of time. Sorcery is supposed to be dangerous and scary which is why you have a forced Forte test Tax against the spell obstacle to see if you body can sustain the spell. Also if you fail the casting you have a chance to summon something bad or cast a completely different spell.,BurningWheel,dgflo81,7,t5_2tr3t
11723577,0,t1_dgovp4v,Its really situational. If its a player thats enchanting something and theres a Belief attached to it Id probably have a failure consequence that isnt just nothing happens. The item is cursed or it fails and the materials are expended and the reason for the enchanting in the first place gets closer to coming to passfurthers its goal. If its an NPC that a player has contracted to enchant something with Resources tests and questing for antecedents Id probably just Say Yes to the NPCs enchanting test since the players already probably done that in pursuit of a Belief.,BurningWheel,dgowbt9,1,t5_2tr3t
