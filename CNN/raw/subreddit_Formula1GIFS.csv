1392701,0,t1_ciqnqtu,Well maldanado could have turned away from more contact as any other driver would do not continuing his corner when he knows Gutierrez cant move much more left.While I agree the initial contact is Gutierrezs fault the contact that nearly flipped Pastor is partly Pastors fault,Formula1GIFS,ciqutvk,3,t5_319bn

3111536,0,t1_cokhsye,Ive explained this in detail already so theres really no more for me to say. The comparison you are drawing between the two scenarios is superficial to anyone who understands the rules of racing. Your judgement of whether evasive action was needed is clearly off. Had Alonso turned in along the racing line to kiss the apex he would have been hit by Klien. That is the line Alonso was entitled to take and its the only line he could take at that speed without going off since any other line e.g. staying on the outside is of tighter radius by definition. As to why Whiting made the calls he did that is an entirely different question. Suffice to say his calls are not always correct or consistent.,Formula1GIFS,cokicuk,0,t5_319bn
