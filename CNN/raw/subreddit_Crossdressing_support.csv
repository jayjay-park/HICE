But all that aside my best advice is have fun. Crossdressing is a way to break the gender rules not be concerned about the rules of how to break the rules. Run wild just try everything. Try dressing like a teen girl going to her first highschool summer party try feeling like a professional woman try looking like a Barbie doll and exct exctThe only way to do this wrong is to let fear dictate behavior. Go girl express yourself!,Crossdressing_support,cn8v2kp,3,t5_2scsz
4478729,0,t1_csv6ype,Yep. I dress like  times a week and wear my cage once or twice a week if I plan on teasing myself or masturbating while dressed andor videoing myself. I dont like getting hard while dressed and I love how sensitive and tingly I feel when Im aroused in chastity.  ,Crossdressing_support,csv7nib,1,t5_2scsz
