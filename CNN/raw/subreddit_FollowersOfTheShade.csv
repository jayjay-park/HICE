3607139,0,t1_cq2pyui,The Gray is already sullied by lumping the ignorant newcomer together with the willful nonpresser.  It is unworthy and to demonstrate true wisdom one must either cast it off in favor of new flair or wear it while simultaneously denouncing flair altogether as I do.    Be the contradiction.  Be the duality.  Transcend the button.,FollowersOfTheShade,cq3fug4,1,t5_37nvh

3692059,0,t1_cqd44hm,There was one situation I believe where the assassins said they rigged an election I have no confirmation on how or when they did this and then they said that the knights rigged it too in favor of someone else. So yes I guess the assassins were active in one attempt. This is the only attempt that has come to light to me even when I was a member of the assassins.Edit if what uwicro says about he post means that the assassins wouldnt really have that looks of reach just the ability to vote multiple times. ,FollowersOfTheShade,cqd4ada,0,t5_37nvh
