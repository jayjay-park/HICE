366732,0,t1_cfiruop,Oh man I could only imagine. I know Cajun French Louisiana Im from the next state over is a branchoff of Acadian French from NB...but I never really heard it outside of a few people I used to work with. I could hear the French influence but that was the end of it. I could definitely use the help once I start picking this up more. Ill tag you in RES and hopefully have word if Ill need the help or not.,moncton,cfirzef,1,t5_2rbp9

1759110,0,t1_ck0vsiq,See I hate any time that someone in this province says anything against learning a language and they are deemed to be totally against it. No one is arguing that it is not beneficial all I was saying is sometimes you have to make a choice of is it worth it to stay and learn or is it worth it to move to further your career. The courses you need for employers are quite expensive because they need to be taken through U de M. I know this because some friends I have who are taking it through their employers are all being sent there because it is the best one and prepares you well for the test.The problem is the economy in this province is stagnant and when you add in a bilingual requirement it removes many options from qualified people. Not saying it is a bad thing to have or learn a new language people just need to decide what is best for them and are they throwing good money and time after bad.All in all you can learn several languages but it does not necessarily mean you are guaranteed a job in this city or province. My wife is bilingual and has lots of years and experience and a degree in her field but still only work temp contracts because that is all that is available. She is fully functional but has been turned down because she does not have the courses in French. She just did emersion in school but can carry on a conversation.,moncton,ck0w5x9,-1,t5_2rbp9

5051916,0,t3_3k4zu1,I think the koodoVirginfido group are all around  for GB data and unlimited Canada wide calling. If youre with Bell and your phone is paid off you can move to virgin without unlocking it. If you want to switch to another you can get it unlocked online for around .  If you need a new phone then usually add another  a month for financing. There are starting to be some good  options for midrange Android phones that are quite good that you could buy outright if you wanted. I have to switch soon too. Im thinking of Fido since they seem to throw in  years of Spotify too. ,moncton,cuuy471,3,t5_2rbp9
