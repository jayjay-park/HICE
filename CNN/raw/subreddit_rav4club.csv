9451991,0,t1_d9do96j,Thats exactly why I bought her instead of a new car. I purchased her recently from an older gentleman whos wife had passed away. Im assuming it was her vehicle.Theres been little things here and there which is not uncommon for older vehicles. Shes about K miles and I had to replace the battery recently and I cant actually drive her at the moment because the ignition wont turn. Something is wrong with the tumblers in it so I have to take it to a locksmith this week. My brothermechanic thinks that someone who owned it before probably sprayed WD in the key hole which makes dust stick to whatever its sprayed on and can make things worse in the long run. I guess well see!Other than that she drives great! I seriously love it. Its very fun to drive and very utilitarian. Its actually kind of amazing how much stuff I can fit in it. I can fold up the tiny back seats to haul things theres panels that pop out of the roof to have sun roofs theres no leaks in them Ive got storage inside the walls of it. ,rav4club,d9e3uh5,2,t5_360rn
