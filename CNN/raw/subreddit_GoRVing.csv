786919,0,t3_234ebt,If this is just for camping really think if you need one that long. The longer the trailer the harder it will be to get into places find parking and merge into traffic. Also with an old trailer like that the frame will be tough as nails but crazy heavy. Depending on your price range there are plenty of newer smaller well designed light trailers out there in the low end price range.

1324158,0,t1_ciihicx,Sweet.  If I may offer two pieces of unsolicited advice which may or may not be good advice  A Dont be too picky with the flooring installation.  When I put mine in I had both a slightly uneven floor and a really odd layout in terms of corners and such so there were a lot of odd imperfections in the layout.  The more theyve handled the heat and movement of the RV the little imperfections have gotten both smaller and bigger but the floor as a whole has held up just fine.  If you worry too much about the layout youll just be more disappointed later.  Screw plumbing.  May not sound like advice and really its not Im just still angry at that sink.  At least in my case all the drains lines and everything else was so far off from standards or even from each other that I had to spend more time and ended up dislocating a rib fixing pipes and drying off the walls from poorly connected drains and hoses than I did doing much else on this thing.  If you can bring in the connections to a plumbing place and show them what you have they should be able to pick you out what you need.  Even better if the standards seem off it may be best just to take it out and try to get everything on the same standard.

3242914,0,t1_coy26qx,One big thing for us is that you can never have enough storage. The fifth wheel has a big advantage over a travel trailer in this area because of the outside storage bays but on the interior for example Im not sure I would consider buying one without the shallow cabinets in the living room slide. Ours also has a ceiling height entertainment centercabinet combo. The cabinets in the slide and the entertainment center are all used for food storage. We even took out the TV added a wire shelf and store food and the slow cooker there.  We also have considerably more kitchen storage space than the unit youre looking at and we have a full size closet in the master bedroom in addition to a large bank of cabinets. The kids also have drawers and a small closet in their room.Something that this unit youre looking at does have that I highly recommend is the dinette. I was highly opposed to the dinette at first I thought it looked uncomfortable and frankly kind of stupid. I was sure I wanted to rip it out and replace it with a space saving table from Ikea. In retrosopect that was moronic. You gain a ton of storage space under the seats there is usually a door at the end and you can also lift the cushion and the plywood to access it. In our household it also duals as the computer desk. I got a clampon arm for the monitor so it swings out of the way when not in use.Have you checked PPL yet?I forgot to mention if nothing else PPL is awesome for looking at floorplans.

Many of the leading brands are all pretty good but you should pick a floor plan that you like and a brand that has features to suit your needs.  bornagainredditors comment about autoleveling is on point.  If you are older and still need to work you definitely dont need to be messing around with leveling your camper.  Putting out blocks and messing with jacks can be a nightmare for your back.  Spend the money and get the good autoleveling feature.  You also have to make sure your truck can tow the thing.  That will limit your choice.  Th wheels tend to be easier to tow but if you dont have the truck to do it you cant go that route.  My advice would be to find out what you can tow how many people will be using it and what your other must have needs are then with your options narrowed look at whats left.

4431339,0,t1_csp0mp3,Youll definitely want to be looking for a trailer that weighs close to  lbs. Keep in mind that RVs are sold with a listed dry weight. Typically they weigh several hundred pounds more than that plus you have to add in the weight of your gear food battery propane options and water if you plan to travel with your tank full. This easily adds up to  lbs or more. Towing too much weight is hard on your tow vehicle and makes for pretty uncomfortable driving.Your best bet is to look at pop ups or Aframes like the Aliner and Chalet. These have the added benefit of a low profile so you dont end up with the huge wind resistance of a tall travel trailer. There are also some smaller lightweight travel trailers such as the Tab that are shorter and narrower.Most of all dont let a salesman talk you into something that is unsafe to tow or unsuitable for your van.

Then check all the bits that slide or turn or mesh when the mechanism is operating.  They should be lubricated in the appropriate places so that the motor doesnt overload.  If all that is ok perhaps the motor itself is going bad and shorting out internally.It seems a little odd that it only happens on the way down  one would think the motor load would be low.

5885339,0,t1_cxqviu7,Thank you! You know thats an interesting question and I think everyones answer is going to be a bit different. We recently met a couple who have been full timers for over  years and just boondocked for the first time last month. They never did it before because they work full time on the road and wanted to always have wifi andor a reliable cell signal to tether  you rarely get wifi when boondocking we are boondocked at a Cracker Barrel right now with some pretty amazing wifi. That said we love it. The only time we count the days is when we are at a place like Cracker Barrel where we cant put our slides out. It gets tight and we can only go for a few days before we need a break. I would definitely recommend not planning to spend all your time in parking lots and try to find places where you can stretch out a bit  put the slides out awning out some camping chairs and relax outside with a beer. RV Parks are great to get a real shower be plugged in and not worry about how much electricity you use  we definitely look forward to spending a couple days at one every now and again to recharge. That said youre typically pretty close to your neighbor there are a lot of rules and quiet hour also many places frown on sitting out side with a beer. Overall I think the better your rig is set up to boondock  upgraded batteries solar big tanks  the more comfortable its going to be since you dont have to run the genny all the time or worry about overflowing the toilet. Oh  and when you boondock on BLM or Forest Service land you can do some target shooting and be ready when the zombies come ,GoRVing,cxr3nww,2,t5_2qu0e

10557391,0,t3_5r58ug,Im with uGutchSeeker I think the best way to get the delivery is to watch a few YouTube vids of salesmen you like and think you could respect.  As in all sales the key is finding out about the person really listening to them and what they want.   Your sales pitch needs to meet the consumer where his life is.   You probably wont need to know all the particulars and numbers for most consumers.  Probably about  of people who come in will be numbercentric.  For the rest theyre getting an RV because they figure all the details will be taken care of automatically.  All you have to do is show them how the RV you present has everything they could want to make their dream a reality.Youll have folks who want to get away each weekend with their kids folks who want to take their grandkids to Disneyland retirees middleagers who want to travel the country and freelance.... the types of people you meet will be endless. Youll have folks who love to cook and really are interested in the kitchen features and people who could care less.  Youll find people who are excited about fishing  you can show them where their rods would fit and recommend a collapsible table to go in conjunction with the outdoor shower as a fish cleaning station.  If you meet a tall person talk a lot about the headroom in the shower and the leg room around the toilet.  Point out any features that make an RV userfreindly whether its good storage extra cameras whatever.  Some people are going to care how the beds convert. Some will care what color scheme the camper has.Some just want to go veg in front of the TV away from their home responsibilities. Layout is important to me.  I love having a bed thats always out so I can move almost directly from driving to sleeping. Like all sales youve just got to sussup the consumer and hone in on the ways your camper is perfect for their vision of RV ownership.  ,GoRVing,dd4ssrf,3,t5_2qu0e
