5523621,0,t3_3qqitd,I have no idea how wed do this but I really think that this sub needs to encourage pictures. The whole reason that this sub was created in my opinion was because there were too many icky pictures in the littlespace subreddit. So I think to help this community of SFW littles grow we should encourage fun pictures. Maybe we could have a weekly SFW caption contest winning bragging rights of course or for something more in depth have a tiny storytelling thread where we can write short like  paragraphs max stories. I know littlespace has one but having a weekly introduction thread stickied at the top might not be bad. Give us a chance to introduce ourselves and maybe find new friends while making sure the feed doesnt get clogged with hi im a new completely non sexual little who needs some advice threads. ,littlesafe,cwhoxfg,5,t5_3ajqi
5560303,0,t3_3rabsg,I like playing computer games coloring or reading when I cant spend time with daddy. You could also try budget build a bear. Basically just go to a thrift store and find a couple stuffies that you think can be cleaned up well. Then check out the baby clothes section and find some that will fit your new friends!! There should be lots of Halloween costumes this time of year and baby clothes are typically in good shape since kids outgrow them so fast!!! You could also spend time working on things for daddy so you feel closer to him even while hes busy. I made daddy a keychain once that he uses still. You could also bake a dessert or something and have it ready for him ,littlesafe,cwmb1n3,4,t5_3ajqi
