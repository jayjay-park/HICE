4806512,0,t1_cu08wjc,Dear Speaker. Allow me to convey to Mr u that there is nothing to be proud of in the  bill. It was a wellspirited attempt but new causes of the breakdowns and the whole system have been identified and are being worked upon as we speakThe main gist that I see Im trying to bring the discussion forward instead of flinging mud on past errors and words is that our transport operators might not have the experience and knowledge necessary to maintain a system. Till now they have only been involved successfully in starting such a system. It is in its maintenance that they falter. And given that LTA is calling in experts from Europe and Japan to look and give pointers for improvements I believe time is what is required not nationalisation not fare changes nothing. It simply might be a case of not having enough experience in such a task and I believe this problem will not go away should we  nationalise this industry. LTA will still be the one calling in experts for us to learn as a nation. I believe we should hold out for the results of the evaluation and recommendations by foreign experts to arrive before we begin to debate on this matter. Debating now without knowing why the breakdowns happen Im quite sure both sides here do not know exactly why all this happened no one in Singapore does will show our impatience and amateurism in handling such situations. And giving solutions to this problem in the way of nationalisation or whatever is counterproductive and is wasting the Parliaments time for now. Elevn,MPOS,cu0efd5,0,t5_391g1
