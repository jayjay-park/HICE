407359,0,t1_cfmxk2p,Agreed. Its a journey Ive done many times.  trains for just under  hours each both terminate at destinations so no danger of falling asleep and missing stops lol.I wouldnt do it for any games with London  south coast opposition. Youd be on with rowdy away fans between London and Norwich lol.,NorwichCity,cfmzmli,1,t5_2sv0y

818126,0,t3_23ia8s,Absolutely gutted. Sterling was ultimately the difference between the two teams but if we play like that against Arsenal we should at least pick up a point and Man Utd have been poor at home this season. With Sunderland beating Chelsea at SB yesterday as well we have to go into that game believing anything can happen. We proved we can score against the league leaders OK not many teams havent scored against Liverpool this season but still so why cant we go to Stamford Bridge and get a result? This season is not over.,NorwichCity,cgx9v0h,6,t5_2sv0y
1009820,0,t1_chj20sr,Champions League where he has no realistic chance of success and a League with absolutely no competition but also managing the club he supports... OR... Managing in a competitive league at a higher standard of football arguably with a real opportunity to impress the bigger teams in England or elsewhere. Also the article states hes open to it as long as Norwich are keen on hiring him.,NorwichCity,chj2ogc,1,t5_2sv0y
1762374,0,t1_ck1ajhj,Josh Murphys goals were superb tonight and he really stood out. Jerome also played fairly well in the first half it was nice to see him constantly chasing the ball.Overall a decent game and a great result!,NorwichCity,ck1ay9q,1,t5_2sv0y
1804657,0,t1_ck6l73h,Think kyle callunmcfadden will be th choice CB ahead of Bassong! I appreciate the effort though  shows strength in the squad which well need as weve got SaturdayTuesday for the next  fixtures!,NorwichCity,ck6mfzs,3,t5_2sv0y
1892763,0,t3_2ganz0,YEAH MUDDAFUGGAS. What a result. Good to see contributions from all over the field. Important save from Ruddy goals from defence midfield and attack. And more importantly what a comeback hopefully we can eradicate these early setbacks from our game but if it galvanises the team I aint complaining.Scoring  goals away from home against a relegated team sploosh ,NorwichCity,ckh9osp,3,t5_2sv0y

4671685,0,t3_3exono,Yes  you will probably need a priority membership most of the tickets get sold out within a few hours of going on general sale so make sure you know the date and get in there early.

4886754,0,t3_3hpq7l,Im nervous we are going to end up over paying massively for a really below par striker example Jelavic really isnt a player Id like at the club. I think quite simply you have to buy abroad to get a decent player for a reasonable price. Although to be fair I think we should just put up the  mil for Charlie Austin ,NorwichCity,cuaii08,1,t5_2sv0y
