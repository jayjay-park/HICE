In terms of fanart I like having fanart because it brings some form of diversity and is truly community created content. A lot of stuff obviously has a lot of hard work put into it. However I agree that the issue of not sourcing is a pretty big one. Yet people dont like when people link to their websites etc because I guess theres issues with promoting your own work?

4183962,0,t1_crx3s4a,tldr left to upvotes alone empty crap you can fart out and get anywhere will always overwhelm interesting complicated content regardless of the quality of the community regardless of what theyd actually prefer to see on the front page.As has been repeated a thousand times in this ongoing discussion  its not enough to simply make good content to counteract the shitty empty calorie stuff because by its very nature the empty calorie stuff will attract upvotes disproportionate to how the community would rate it in a direct comparison between it and a more thoughtful piece of work.Fan art memes easy jokes dumb pics tweets one liners and other easily digestible material are really really easy to look at like and upvote. You can punch through  images in two minute in that way. Meanwhile a thoughtful article or vibrant discussion is going to hold your attention for several minutes by itself. Unfortunately Reddit doesnt really measure time engaged or whether you ultimately preferred one piece of content to another. Everything gets one upvote and thats it. This means that easy to upvote stuff will garner massive scores with little engagement or interest while more considered gear will  at best  grow much more slowly and have a much harder time being seen. Anyone who has time to read an article has time to upvote a dumb meme. The opposite is not necessarily true.This is why good subreddits have mods who restrict brainless content and try to corral good but problematic content like fan art and the kind of questions that end up in the Monday Megathread. You need to give space for hard content to be seen. Its just fact of life with an upvote system.,LeagueOfMeta,crx6ann,11,t5_37yoi

4195435,1,t1_crycdvw,Lol you have no idea what youre talking about and your argument is confused and incoherent.You just argued that your subreddit is a place for longform league content.  That suggests that as rriotfreelol scales the moderators will work to address the problems that come with scale such as the emphasis on lower value content due to the mathematical advantage that content has.  That means youre arguing that rriotfreelol is a place for people to come if they want quality curated content.You are arguing literally in the same breathgtHowever independent articles are one of the main differences between our two subs whereas you heavily curate nonriot sponsored articles by censoring the authors at attacking the publications ...This is something we dont do and you should know that were it not for having the preconceived notion that I am corruption incarnate that must clearly therefore represent all that is evil with the world.  Our actions have never had anything to do with whether the content is sponsored by anyone.  I dont give a shit who sponsors anything.  Being a journalist isnt a free license to abuse others.  Nor is being a rioter a free license to abuse others.  Fortunately rioters can lose their jobs if they abuse members of the community.  What happens to journalists that abuse others though?  Most of the time very little.  But if it happens often enough and over enough time of course people are going to react.If your beloved alternative is such a bastion of transparency and objective decisionmaking then why isnt the subreddits traffic page publicly available?  Why do they sensor any rleagueoflegends mod that deigns talk to one of those community members in a neutral way just because they decided to use their main account to do so?  If we tried to react to feedback we saw in that subreddit publicly theyd force us to use an alt account to do sotrying to reinforce how shady we are through their own shitty decision making.Seems to me that your beloved subreddit has a great number of problems with it and is led by egomaniacs that think they can do better simply by doing nothing.  There is a reason that this metasub has more than double rriotfreelols active users and it isnt the riotsponsored nature of this subreddit.Go back to your favorite hub for baseless conspiracy because thats what rriotfreelol really is.,LeagueOfMeta,cryh67n,2,t5_37yoi

Theyre dumb and should forever stay outside of the organizations that I care about.Instead I would want to look for invested caring individuals that have the needs of the subreddit at the forefront of their interests.  From my perspective the community mods would have the entire say over how discussion happens in this subreddit.  We wouldnt be dictating anything to them about how best to curate the discussion that happens in rleagueofmeta.  The flipside there though is that if the place becomes too hostile to us or stops being worth my time Ill just focus on communicating through other subreddits.In essence the money goes with the mouth Ill vote with my feet if this place goes to shit in the community mods hands.Regarding the suggestion of community mods joining the team from my perspective all of the current mods are community mods.  This distinction makes no sense.  We are part of the community with many of us especially the most recent adds having been prominent constructive parts of the community for months and in some cases years.  That is literally one of the most important attributes I look for in a successful candidate for joining our team.So of course if a person that joins the rleagueofmeta team has enough of the qualities that I find to be desirable as a moderator of rleagueoflegends Im entirely open to supporting their candidacy to join the team.  But as far as some weird You need community mods on the team argument it doesnt make a lick of sense to me.

4232749,0,t1_cs2oxky,Hello Jacob.Its good to know you have a trustworthy editor behind the work Daily Dot puts out. But since you do how is it that things like the CLG holding Stixxay captive article get published? There didnt seem to be much of a factual basis to that article based on the responses from those involved. The Yusui segment is a different situation as the only current issue is Nick Allens comment and what that may entail. The rest of the article was factual as far as Ive seen. And as you mentioned youve published plenty of things that ended up being accurate and I knew that when posting this. The original post was not directed at you in particular its just that you were the source of the two most recent memorable examples for me. My concern isnt just with your work its about the way the current rules could allow for unfounded accusations that could cause some real damage to someones image regardless of the person writing the article.And to reiterate since people keep missing this I do not think we should be asking you or any other content producer to hand over names of your sources.

If the data isnt being obtained illegally I stand firmly against censoring it but if there is a lack of firm proof then perhaps a rumor tag or something of the like is a good compromise? An unknown account pops up in Korea and always plays ADC and always duos with Lustboy. I cant state beyond a shadow of a doubt that its Turtle but its a reasonable assumption in my opinion based on the data that is being released and available to everyone. If we are going to allow a small group of people in this case the mods to determine what qualifies as a reasonable assumption I think its a slippery slope.

He has been warned about this multiple times but is caught red handed after continuing to do so. Bobs channel is added into Automoderator for a duration. For that duration Bobs Channel is removed. Afterwards Bobs Channel is taken off and posts continue.I wasnt around for the gamespotongamers one but thats how its done now.The vast majority of deletions done by mods are actually at the request of the community via reports.  The community looks at posts  If they dont think they fit the ruleset it gets reported.When stuff gets reported we see it and evaluate whether the report reason is valid. For instance if theres a video that gets posted  It rockets to the top of front page. It gets reported for vote manipulation. Is there anything that proves that is vote manipulated? Nope. It will get approved.Something in the thread point to vote manipulation? It will get discussed by the mods on at the time and either approved or removed with a reason. If its a front page removal a post here in LoM will happen.Not sure how things were done before but thats how theyre done now!,LeagueOfMeta,cvbv2za,1,t5_37yoi

5463606,0,t3_3pwh5w,Surely it doesnt matter if RL is banned at all. Were questioning if Reddit is banning access to his content or just his content in general. I could easily host his video on my Facebook page and simply there isnt much RL could do about it. He might even protest this because I could coin from it. So the question which needs answered is simple. Does Reddit want nothing to do with RL even to the point that a person cant link a FB post to then get access to his content from another source? Subreddit admins can only delete posts and categories them as a content ban but thats just merely a term. They have no say to the Reddit adspace which then would question if Reddit would make a rule that would allow subreddit admins the ability to revoke ads which would effectively clean this situation up without Reddit having to declare a censor on RLs content. ,LeagueOfMeta,cwa0zil,2,t5_37yoi

There is definitely an ethical question here and my stance is that Riot doesnt serve ads so its fine they care more about exposure. Everything else is out of question. Considering all the TwitterAsk.FMOddshotetc bots flowing around I really dont think I am setting a precedent anywhere.However I do think that a public library that translates HTML gt Reddit Markdown may promote other bots to be created that will scrape from other third party websites. So Ill reconsider that part. Maybe it should be specific to only be able to translate from leagueoflegends.com. At this point I am not even sure if any form of HTML gt Reddit Markdown can be done in a seamless way since the markdown has a very narrow set of functionalities compared to HTML.

Normal reposts still are not allowed. Deleting and resubmitting will get the thread removed and result in a spam warning or spam ban.

6044957,0,t3_3yapbc,First of all. You did not message us about this thread.In fact I just looked through our modmail archives and there is not a single message from you ranging from December th to today.Secondly. Do you happen to have a suggestion about what to do against making fun of less skilled players?Im saying it like that because history proved that content creators who show their fail plays will not be abused. Hence its not as much bullying but much more making fun of a group of players. The very strong majority of all players. Around  to be exact.Even in the thread you linked we can see that the very strong majority of users dont care at all about who that player is. Very few point out the name. Some to make OP aware of the fact that he did not hide the name completely very few actually attack that user which is absolutely already against the subreddit rules and were removed as such. Additionally those comments were also downvoted showing that the community does not think its ok to say that about another player regardless whether or not they will read it.Its easy to say Something should be done but realistically. Its not nearly as bad as you make it out to be. We have a society where fail home videos are evening entertainment on major television networks. Of course fail gameplay will be a thing online. And people will say and think exactly the same as they did with the fail home videos. The specifics will be slightly different but it comes down to what an idiot. You can not really compare that to bullying.I do agree to a certain degree that the elitist Im diamond x and hereby declare you have no clue about the game. mentality a lot of users on this subreddit have is not ideal and given the power to change all people visiting the subreddit something definitely on my list of todos.But it isnt within my power. Theoretically we could add a rule against it... which would be arbitrary at best since we have no way of actually enforcing it. We can not monitor all comments on every thread. It also would have an incredibly grey line. What exactly should be disallowed? Using your tier in arguments? Talking about not perfect gameplay?So what exactly is it what you want to change and do have any suggestion at all of how that could be changed?,LeagueOfMeta,cyc01jq,8,t5_37yoi

6076801,0,t1_cyg3gvt,gt Why should that not be allowed but two people doing the same should? A talk show usually has some sort of dialogue. It also is different from an interview since it is not centered around one persons the guests experiences and person but topics in general to make this clear.gt What if one person has scripted everything? It would basically be the same but with very slightly more effort while producing in terms of getting one friend to read a couple of lines.Yes there will always be people trying to cheat. The thing is why go so far to script everything when you could also just talk freely? There wouldnt be any gain making the show possibly much less interesting and risking to seriously hurt the reputation of everyone involved. It wouldnt violate the rules but it would be a horrible talk show that most likely wouldnt be worth the effort and wouldnt find much acclaim in the community. I know this was just an example but even if this would be allowed I dont see an issue here.gt The only issue I see is if the focus is user interaction. Because if those people just talk to each other a delay in watching it shouldnt be an issue as its the same content.Yep you could argue that there is no gain in watching it live. But there is no user interaction for any LoL events either.

7423660,0,t3_4gxljz,I had a little chat with ucorylulu and a couple others about this sort of thing on our discord server last night but I was pretty tired from working way too much and discord is sometimes not great for organized discussion with a bunch of people trying to talk over each other all at once so I figure Ill throw my thoughts here on itBear with me this might be super long.The actual Riot Pls list is going to look super daunting to the average user  Its something that seems to have come about from necessity  Things that are talked about so often with the same opinions being repeated over and over again to the point where users become sick and tired of it.These topics boil down to the comment sections being one of two things Rehashedrecycled comments repeating the same opinions  I think we should have a sandbox mode I dont Dota had a sandbox mode  years ago! Riot sux People actively complaining in the comment section that this is posted every goddamn day what the fuckA good example we were chatting about yesterday was voice chat  A topic that has literally been clubbed to death for years.Part of the problem with this is also Reddits search function which sucks by the way in that it makes it incredibly hard to find relevant recent information. If you search for voice chat right now you get the following searchAs you see it comes up with Riot Lytes ask.fm stuff some discussion some stuff about alternative voice chat servers and whatnot. Skim through the comments on some of them  You read the same things over and over again. Females feel unsafe and uncomfortable using mandatory voice chat But that doesnt mean it shouldnt exist People like the concept of voice chat People dont like the concept of voice chat Rito suxxx Toxicity memes Now if it was fine to post stuff about voice chat again what kind of discussion is going to be generated from it? Whats the goal of posting about voice chat again?Heres the thread from yesterday about voice chat that was removedHere are the main comments ToxicityLyte memes Rito sux Toxicity memesHow do we not have voice chat I like voice chat I dont like voice chatWas there any new differing or otherwise interesting opinions in the thread? There was a random Rioter who popped into it to talk about a completely different issue intentional feeding reporting but was there anything there that hadnt been beaten to death   times already?Lets just put this out there  ucorylulu made a good point in that posts and threads have a certain amount of power in that sometimes they can put pressure on Riot. I like that  Strong opinions and interesting conversations can always have a positive effect on the community and Riot itself its something that makes Reddit unique in that it gives a large section of a certain community a voice.When I look at threads in new I usually talk in ones specifically that I think can start or generate good discussion Which doesnt always work but I like to see pieces that stimulate thought or get people to look at a new side of an issue. Say what you will about Richard Lewis but Im sad that my time here came directly after that whole deal was unfixable by both sides because he has a way of poking and prodding to make people think differently about issues that is something really missing around the subreddit these days. Not many people really go out of their way to do that sort of thing And I cant blame them since easier writing is absorbed by people who want to read and digest something short instead of something that makes them think.Anyway my whole point with this meandering is that the Riot Pls list is both suffocating yet also requested and necessary in a way.Take a point like Adding your Champion grade to your Match History  It has been asked so many times that its actually in the Riot Pls in  other instances.And thats just the ones that are archived  Im sure we could put  more threads on there within a couple months if we really wanted.Remember rleagueoflegends has SO MUCH TRAFFIC. The average user doesnt see it but we get a couple thousand threads a day. Tons are down voted a few are upvoted a few are deleted so most people just see the front page but since I spend my time primarily in new this is stuff that gets asked all the time every day dozens of times a dayMy brainstorm suggestions if we want to change something with itThe Riot Pls list is meant for stuff that is literally posted so often that it is literally a dead horse  Therefore it is supposed to bypass the repost rule  month for not front page thread  months for frontage thread. What could be modified? Make Riot Pls follow a  month rule inviting discussion about topics twice a year.This would restrict the topic so people do not post about it every day bludgeoning horses to death constantly  Yet allow possible discussion of the topic every once in a while to see if anything new comes out of it.Hopefully all this makes sense.Thoughts?,LeagueOfMeta,d2m0shx,23,t5_37yoi

A situation where people can just say I trust you and just count that as a second approval is not uncommon not only among moderation but just people in general.In this manner a second person may not actually be checking it.

7826864,0,t1_d3vstyh,Hashinshin is more than intelligent enough to construct his thread without all capping shit and hurling insults. Hes also done this before and had things removed. He knows the rules and chose not to follow them. I personally dont find it difficult to just not be emotional about things. To me it is easy to just write a post neutrally and take out all the personal rhetoric. Hash doesnt have to sit around the campfire and hold hands with Riot when he makes his post but he also doesnt have to be a dick. None of the points he made required him to insult anyone to make them he could have just as easily left a bunch of stuff out and it would have been fine until evidently it got removed for megathread stuff I would guess?. Now maybe some people believe that it was acceptable enough that it shouldnt have been removed and its fine if they think that. But personal assessment doesnt override the moderation team believing that it was too much and met the rant rule. Like I said this kind of rule is inherently subjective and there will always be a section of people that disagree with pretty much every single removal. Ideally the way it works is that the moderation team takes note of those disagreements considers it and discusses it amongst themselves and it can influence how they treat things moving forward.,LeagueOfMeta,d3vt0yy,1,t5_37yoi

8419548,0,t3_4uy3y5,Its just such a grey area. You cant really make a rule regarding relevancy because how do you define when something breaks that rule? It would just hurt the modteams consistency. Why I say that? BecauseFor example mod A removes video comparing Overwatch and League gamestyles. He considers it irrelevant to League and decides the primary focus lies with Overwatch.Mod B think the primary focus lies with League of Legends. But its still the same video. If there is a relevancy rule because of the way he views the focus of the video the rule is not broken.In this example I am calling it a rule but its basically still moderators discretion Which is where inconsistencies come fromRelevancy is just subjective. What I think is relevant does not apply for the next person. So a rule regarding it just seems somewhat impossible to makeAlso just banning all posts like the one in my example would decrease the quality of posts not increase.

Now its all about consistency because the general populace doesnt understand the difference between discretion and bias nazi mods.However if you look at the rules this post is clearly in opposition of them. By allowing this through you just open it up more for why is my post not allowed but that is? And then you open yourself up to the dumbest personal stories that the mods have no backing for why they dont deserve to be up there and we get back to the original issue.

10377750,0,t1_dckdbcf,Full disclosure I think both this post and the Worlds Face Guy post should be allowed    That said theyre incredibly similar. Even the body. Ill use WFG to reference Worlds Face Guy from now on    WFG starts off with Some backstory which was a personal tale of him loving the competitive scene being unable to go to worlds contacting support and then the support team contacting him in return.    Gnarpet starts off with Short story so the same stuff but different words followed by... a personal tale of him searching for a gift for his niece being unable to get a plushie contacting support and then the support team contacting him in return.    Their titles are also similar both first person accounts of something awesome they asked of Riot that they received.     In the LoM thread about WFGs removal uAlkser stated this And the th paragraph is violating another rule he directly addresses Bombadil the Riot Support and the Suppoert crew.    Yet in the Gnarpet thread we again see at the bottom Im honestly speechless and grateful by Riot games! Thank you so much! lt which is the exact same thing.    In the LoM thread it was stated again by uAlkser that The only not the sole content part of that thread was the video. Yet the only not the sole content part of the Gnarpet thread is the two pictures. Exchange the imgur album for a link to a video and its basically cookie cutter.    ,LeagueOfMeta,dckdr5b,3,t5_37yoi

In the same vein him being able to upload his personal stream highlights isnt relevant when he uploads highlights from Korean Soloqueue and can no longer include any SKT players. The rule clearly states that it must affect a content creators ability to produce content not prevent them from producing content.

I understand that.nope idc about tyler I dont watch his stream and the odds of me getting matched against him are low.gtwere not here tho showcase a particular streamers behaviour. Its not rleagueofstreamers its rleagueoflegends.
