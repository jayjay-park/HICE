Having results appear in a form element might be a good idea I think it might be a lot neater than dealing with opening and closing Add forms Search forms Edit forms and worksheets.Edit On second thoughts this code wont go back and find the next instance of my search terms itll only find the first instance.

I guess I really dont understand how threading works.  Lets say I push the button and my first counter starts.  I am assuming I am currently in the label thread.  If i push my second button to start my second counter I am attempting to start a second thread from the first thread and that gives me the error.  Is my thinking correct?  How do delegates come into play to allow my to access the second thread for the second counter?  Not sure if that makes sense.,visualbasic,cg6m5fj,1,t5_2rb58
589997,0,t3_20wa8m,The largest issue you have is using bad variable types..The very first thing to do is to go to My Project in the solution explorer and to the compile tab and set both option explicit and option strict to on. This will force you to declare your variable types and save you from countless hours of troubleshooting mystery issues. The main issue I see is that you arent converting the contents of the score textboxes to a number before adding them. This will unfortunately concatenate them not perform math on them. So if I put   and  into the three score textboxes intsum will   not .The easy fix is to convert them inline        intSum  Convert.ToIntTxtscore.Text  Convert.ToIntTxtscore.Text  Convert.ToInttxtScore.Text    but this will cause an error if the value of the textBox isnt a number. Ideally you want to create  new integers one for each score and try to parse the textbox value into them        Dim Score As Integer    Integer.TryParseTxtscore.Text score        Dim Score As Integer    Integer.TryParseTxtscore.Text score        Dim Score As Integer    Integer.TryParseTxtscore.Text score        intSum  score  score  score        ....,visualbasic,cg7c4kg,1,t5_2rb58

1433182,0,t1_cih30qw,Use the right control for the job creating a form that does the work of a Grid is crazy even if your teacher says this. Tell him a pro says He is on crack then do it anyways.I would use a datagrid for this I have provided an example in another location.You could also use a datarepeater control to the same effect. If you absolutely have to do this make sure you use a panel object with the autoscroll property turned on. Then programmatically add to the panel control collection the controls as needed. you can reiterate through the control collection getting the values of the textboxs.PROTIP Dont forget to set the name property when adding the control to the collection. This makes it easier to figure out which control is the one you want. Unless you just want to process them all the same way.    For each TempControl in me.controls         if TempControl.name  foo then              Do Something         end if    Nextor process only the control types you need to speed up the application.

This is because as you loop through youre looking at the same item and only check to see if it is checked or not. The if ...else is deciding where to put the item once that determination is made.You could just as easily use your code for the checked since youre just reading the checkeditems collection but that would take a loop through the checkeditems and a loop through the list to find unchecked.

3748564,0,t1_cqjilmc,That sounds good I know I might come across as pedantic but I find that beginning developers when they hear a piece of advice from a more advanced dev will tend to follow it carte blanche without actually understanding why. So when you said Every Sub and Function they will take that to mean literally every sub and function should have a try catch and should log. Im actually in the situation now where Im tasked with improving the process and the code of our developers. My biggest hurdle trying to break the bad habits of our developers in my department and get them to improve the code they write. The problem is that about ten years ago a group of advanced devs with a background in C and C set the standards and gave the initial training for .Net languages and the bad habits have stuck around. For instance Im having a bitch of a time convincing the devs the following   Not to set ints and floats to  when they first declare them as they are already set  Not to wrap every method in a try catch and set all variables declared inside of it to Nothingnull so that they get cleaned up properly  Not to declare all variables at the top of every method instead of right before they are used.

It gets the sizing and positions and through those values it draws the x and y axis on the screen.The problem is that the values for the size of the picBox are the ones of the control on the IDE not those on the maximized window at run time.thus the axis turning out really small.Is this better? is it the same thing?  ,visualbasic,ctewr68,1,t5_2rb58

Its programming and theres huge money in it.A couple of years went by before I really started getting nerdy about computers and wanted to know how the software worked  of course I had grandiose delusions of creating a vast MMORPG so I set out to learn GP... in VB. It was impossible to get help from the indie community as they were all c devs and told me to learn a real language.Being the stubborn nut that I am I forged ahead on my own and learned a great deal and even produced my first little tiled game world which I was excited about. Then I quit for several years got married got a job etc...Then Id transitioned to an IT job and my boss in favor of continued learning and let me get a copy of VB.NET. I began learning again and quickly fell in love with VB once again. Over the years Id dabbled in C HTML and Javascript but VB.NET felt soooo much more intuitive to me. No annoying casing braces semicolons etc... And that Intellisense... I set out to reproduce my old VB game project as a refresher and found that it was sooo much easier than it was in VB.Then I started writing modules for out ERP system and found that it was super easy to work with our SQL database.Thats it in a nut shell.
