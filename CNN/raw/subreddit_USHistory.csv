310648,0,t3_1xml5h,For me I felt my schooling lacked a significant amount of i.e. any Middle Eastern history. Is there a better less U.S. term for that region?  When I see a world event or something on TV I think Why is it like that? and try to find a book that covers the basics.  Topics like the Crusades the Silk Road and even more modern topics such as the events leading to the formation of Israel were never really covered in school. Reading about them has been very enlightening and has given me a broader perspective of those regions based on their past. Given the impact that region has on current U.S. foreign and military policy it is a good place to explore.I dabble in history so Im no expert. I love Ottoman history but I jump all over the map. Thats one reason askhistorian is one of my very favorite subs.,USHistory,cfcytlw,0,t5_2rcqc
734996,0,t3_22kosa,thanks hankinstien. As to free labor I meant labor that doesnt cost anything. Not free labor ideology which seems to have been the thing in the north where the folks doing the labor were free men. Sorry about that confusion. As for the slaves gathering up a large portion of the souths production I just meant that the slaves were quite literally gathering up as in picking or collecting most of the cotton and the cotton was I assume most of the souths product at this time. ,USHistory,cgntmw9,1,t5_2rcqc

6145281,0,t1_cyo4g5l,The popular vote doesnt count at all on a federal level because each state gets to choose the method of electing the electors. It just so happens that currently every state chooses their electors through some sort of popular vote although not all of them are winnertakeall. If they decided to have the state legislature choose them as in the distant past or that all the electors would go to the winner of the national popular vote a proposal that is supported in some states that would be perfectly constitutional.,USHistory,cyo5jp8,1,t5_2rcqc
6145790,0,t1_cyo38kh,Richard Hofstafter is a wellregarded oftcited and Pulitzer Prize winning historian. If you disagree with his interpretation of history thats fine but critique his interpretation rather than being lazy and hurling an insult.The context in which an author writes is extremely important including their background where did they study and who influenced their thinking as well as the broader political social economic context in which a piece is written. If you want to engage in that discussion great! Thatd be interesting and productive. ,USHistory,cyo7mq3,3,t5_2rcqc
