1448416,0,t3_2aphgb,gtThoughts on this? I dont hear a lot about this type of setup perhaps because its an incredibly bad idea??Microsoft specifically states not to do this.gtI know some people are thinking of this next scenario and the HyperV product group anticipated this too.  Some people will look at HyperV Replica and see it as a way to provide an alternative to clustered HyperV hosts in a single site.  Although HyperV Replica could do this it is not intended for for this purpose.gtThe replication is designed for low bandwidth high latency networks that the SME is likely to use in intersite replication.  As youll see later there will be a delay between data being written on hostcluster A and being replicated to hostcluster B.gtYou can use HyperV Replica within a site for DR but thats all it is DR.  It is not a cluster where you fail stuff back and forth for maintenance windows  although you probably could shut down VMs for an hour before flipping over  maybe  but then it would be quicker to put them in a saved state on the original host do the work and reboot without failing over to the replica.In my opinion you should buy two less powerful HyperV hosts then a xd stuffed with drives but only a C proc with GB of RAM and use the xd as an SMB . file server so you can have a real cluster.,HyperV,cixu28a,2,t5_2rraq

3301716,0,t1_cp4m1md,gt Yah this is what I thought too but apparently no.gt It turns out there is some fuckery in hyperv routing and this is a known issuefeature. There is a solution it just means segregating the network and having traffic go out of the host and into the switch then back in again.I run this exact setup in my environment right now. I have two gateways on our firewall on different subnets  one for our normal network and one for VLANs. All I do is install a VM assign the correct subnet settings inside the OS ... and it works.,HyperV,cp4mepk,1,t5_2rraq

3751255,0,t3_33dipp,I used CAU in my previous job on a   hosts cluster with approx  VMs. Hosts were configured by GPO to download update from our WSUS server once a week and updates job were executed manually via CAU by the end of the month.

6118710,0,t3_3zct54,. Yes this is MS recommended best practice.  You will still be able to authenticate with domain credentials on the host if the DC is unavailable assuming you have already logged onto it previously or you will still be able to logon to the host with the local accounts.. You would need to authenticate to the host using its local accounts.,HyperV,cyl4txg,1,t5_2rraq

7356977,0,t1_d2ee0kj,gt My understanding is that nesting is the process of emulatingvirtualizing applications within WinServerrYour definition of nesting is wrong. What you are referring to is simply virtualization. Nesting is when you want to run a hypervisor within another hypervisor. For example if you create a HyperV host then you create a guest VM on that host and install HyperV on that guest VM then you are nesting. The same applies to VMware or any other hypervisor.                                                                                   |           |          |                                                   |    VM     |   VM     |                                                   |||                                                    |                      |                                                    |      HyperV         |      ||    |                       |                      |                      |    |    Linux Guest VM     |   Windows Guest VM   |   Windows Guest VM   |    |                       |                      |   with HyperV Role  |    ||||    |                                                                     |    |                              HyperV                                |    ||    ,HyperV,d2efs0c,2,t5_2rraq

7904581,0,t1_d44iuqg,Passthrough disks were more of a workaround for the TB limit that existed on VHDs at the time. The VHDX format has increased this limit and implemented new improvements that make passthrough disks all but obsolete.

9185425,0,t3_5645t7,I did the exact same thing in Win  because I didnt realize that someone else had turned on a check point and never turned it off. I tried a bunch of tools like the ones in your links to rebuild the chain and couldnt get it to work. I called Microsoft and paid the  for an expedited incident ticket and they were able to fix it in about  hours.  Money well spent. Id recommend you try them if you havent already and do it before you make things worse by trying tools you find that start changing the differencing disks. Good news is you will damn sure never make this particular mistake again so at least you got that going for you. And backups.....,HyperV,d8gbir8,9,t5_2rraq

10374877,0,t1_dcczg29,OK so this worked  To close the loop here this is what I did. Its pretty much the same thing as what you suggested.. Shut down VM via RDP or FCM. Copy vhdx file from CClusterStorageVolumeVMName to CtempVMName on a host. In FCM create a VMNamev VM using the same memory cores and generation as the original and point it to the vhdx from the previous step. One the VM is up and running wait for it to appear in the VMM console then migrate it to another host ticking the box to make it highly available. Confirm its all good and then delete the original VM and files.Thanks again.  down  to go...,HyperV,dck1zoc,1,t5_2rraq

10799858,0,t1_ddtuebt,Yeah its totally boggling my mind. Whats even crazier is the backup does finish and it unpauses the VM itself. When we had the issue back in the fall we did run all of the hotfixes for the host. My superior though just suspended backups for the cluster and never came back to the issue. We even tried the solution of vssadmin delete shadowstorageand vssadmin add shadowstorageNo luck. I will probably run through hotfixes again and recreating the shadow stoagres again and see. We havent tried to rebuild the VM as of yet. ,HyperV,ddtxfih,1,t5_2rraq
