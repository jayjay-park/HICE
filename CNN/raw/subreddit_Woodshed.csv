2570259,0,t3_2p7ikh, Yes  what pianists do with the chords is really important in the context of improv. In particular the entire purpose of transcribing is to build your ear and therefore transcribing these chords is a fundamental part of the process. So work on recognizing these chords! Yes  what did you have in mind otherwise? From the top of my head John Lewis solo on Summertime The Modern Jazz Quartet  The Complete Last Concert is pretty simple but OMFG so effective.,Woodshed,cmu2kkg,4,t5_2t3vr
2953651,0,t3_2sku42,Combine playing tunes with physical practice like muscle memory. Just apply the technique youre trying and learning in the context of actual songs you like playing. Thing is to be able to practice a long time you have to actual enjoy what youre doing. no one wants to sit and play non musical shit for hours. So yeah play music and try harder things over those songs. Composing is important too.,Woodshed,co3ueid,1,t5_2t3vr

5641115,0,t3_3q92hr,Work on leaving space in your solos. I am not a drummer but all the drummers I know and play with leave space and dont just thrash at the instrument like some. It is important to completely stay in the pocket and dont lose tempo. Explore polyrhythms and more complex rhythmic structures and cross rhythms for an interesting sound.  ,Woodshed,cwwc1yt,1,t5_2t3vr

7211088,0,t1_d1xtuof,Freddie is already on my list .  I hold that one back for a bit later because Wynton and Miles are a bit more free with their scale choices but on the other hand theyre great studies for branching out beyond stock blues scale lines.,Woodshed,d1xuev0,2,t5_2t3vr
