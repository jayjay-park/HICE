6057476,0,t1_cyd7o9f,Oh OK. Thought it was an isolated problem. I did notice however that there are some lag issues with the default controller playing Black Ops . They are not as bad as the issues when playing with a Scuf but its happening. I find this all very weird and the fact that no one high up is picking this up is really frustrating. ,scufgaming,cydmrjh,1,t5_345qp
9074116,0,t1_d82jirx,Yea Im making the switch to PS and just want to make sure Im getting the best product I can. Do you think SCUF will announce the new controllers or just start to roll them out once commercially available?,scufgaming,d82k88g,1,t5_345qp

10290028,0,t3_5lu3sm,I have the same issue with a stock PS dual shock controller.  This happens quite frequently with COD Infinite Warfare.  I actually have to turn off the PS and turn back on to recover.Edit  I have a new PS Slim.,scufgaming,dcafid0,1,t5_345qp
10477641,0,t1_dcvqdwc,I believe it mines a ps infinity me and allot of my friends have them and I would say  in  are probably faulty.Never had a left paddle problem though as I mentioned my right paddle has now cracked but its clearly replaceable. How long have you had it?,scufgaming,dcvqz8v,1,t5_345qp
