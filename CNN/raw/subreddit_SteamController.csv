5576792,0,t1_cwobfk9,Its ultimately matter of opinion but a physical comparison of the two shows that not only is the SC a fair bit wider overall its grips are shaped so that the optimal resting points for the thumbs are on the touchpads.This is in contrast to the DS which has more cylindrical grips that allow your palm to rotate and provide support whether you are using the stick or the dpad. Of course this wouldnt work as well for the SCs touchpads which are geared for greater precision.Before the Steam Controller I used the PS controller exclusively on my PC putting in hundreds of hours across almost every genre. ,SteamController,cwocpxy,1,t5_2ymn6

5592737,0,t3_3rnq1q,ok so like the default sensitivity setting is marked at like  of the sensitivity slider setting at maximum sensitivity would probably give you nearly  full spinsmessing around on my own i would start off at maybe about which would give nearly degrees and eventually dial it back a bit until it felt good to where i make quick movements but not too sensitive where even just a roll of your thumb moves your aim a significant distanceand yeah you can disable trackball mode and it will act like a mouse where it will just stop if you pick up your thumb no matter how fast you swipedif you are playing a game that does not require too many separate buttons you could have two sensitivities simply by squeezing one of the grips and you would have have instant accurate mode or an instant quick flick mode...or combine with the gyro for a different mode..or.. or..the steam controller is definitely the swiss army knife of game controllers,SteamController,cwqby0u,3,t5_2ymn6

5633481,0,t1_cwvd8yt,Yes. That is the whole point of the mouse joystick setting. It is a way to make the trackpad feel more mouselike for games that only support using the joystick for camera control. But you need to turn the joystick sensitivity up in the game.

5641488,0,t3_3scrjk,You can do this but not through the Steam UI at least not yet hopefully they will add this soon its been requested by myself and probably several othersBut the way to set up your own configs that will show up in the Templates side bar you will either need to do some text file editing or you will need to edit a profile in BPM set it up how you like then give it a unique nametitle.Then drop out to your desktop go into your Steam installed folder usually program files but if youve installed it elsewhere go there and in the userdata folder search for the title you gave that binding. It should find a .vdf file with that title as the filename. Copy that .vdf file and then paste it into Steam install pathcontrollerbasetemplates.Theres a chance with any Steam client updates that the templates might get overwrittenwiped when new ones come in. So youll want to make sure to keep a backup of your own template files so you can copy them back into the Steamcontrollerbasetemplates folder.So to recap and clarify my rambling above Any controller configs you set up for games are in Steamuserdata somewhere best to use the search function because that is a nightmare maze of subfolders. Any templates are in Steamcontrollerbasetemplates. Any of your own bindings you want to reuse for other games copy the .vdf file for those bindings from the Steamuserdatawherever to the Steamcontrollerbasetemplates Alternatively you can take one of the .vdf files already in the templates folder make a copy of it then open that copy up in a text editor preferably something better than Notepad and manually edit any bindings. But using BPM to configure with a GUI then copypasting the resulting file where it needs to go is probably a whole lot easierfaster. Either way keep backups of your custom templates in case a Steam client update wipes them out.,SteamController,cwwdpv6,4,t5_2ymn6

Restrict the pads Vertical movement and use it mainly for turning though its still kind of slow compared to Mouse. And use the Gyro motion as aiming in front of you works WAY better then the pad.

Mistakes will be made.gt Its not as intuitive unless they change the game prompts and workings to work with the new action lists.This is in the Steam SDK and if it is not supported it is due to dev omission.  Well be graceful in these circumstances and assume they didnt have time to add it.gt the main feature of the controller is its customizabilityThe main feature is its versatility. Being customizable lends itself to that in the case of games which do not officially support the controller i.e. legacy games.Valve does not want you to need to customize the controls but tries to ensure you can still play any game under the sun.,SteamController,cxbwh61,2,t5_2ymn6
5771198,0,t1_cxcee1x,haha no worries mate! Those community templates had space mouse binds and so on. Like you were able to do in .However Valve decided to provide native support. So now were binding Jump and Fire. It was essentially an overhaul of how to configure the Steam Controller. This caused all the templates that were made before the change unusable and thus turning up as empty. Which sucked because not only were the community templates gone all the previous configuration you made for yourself were also gone. A bit more info because I have a problem with knowing when to shut up People started using popular templates before the change before they were empty but then never looked at it again because it takes time and effort to get good in CSGO when you switch from KBM to a Steam Controller. Thus the templates with most users are empty since the update There might be  community templates that are not empty but they will not be at the top. I hope this clears it up.

5960075,0,t3_3x18oq,Ive mentioned somewhere previously that in most of the negative reviews Ive found the problems are not with the controller they are with the reviewer and your experience is a perfect example that proves that point.Most of the reviewers have based their reviews on their own personal experiences and expectations of existing game controllers instead of reviewing the controller for its unique capabilities. You see moans about buttons not being in the right place or feeling strange or that the pads take some getting used to or that there is a supposed steep learning curve and that the configuration screen is complicated.But all of these criticisms are not issues with the controller itself they are issues with the person using it issues that they just need to overcome to properly appreciate how awesome the controller is. And when someone like yourself gets to use it someone with no expectations or baggage they like it straight off the bat!I predict that many websites are eventually going to have to eat their words and admit that they were too hasty in their judgement and probably claim that software updates have made it better which is only true in part.,SteamController,cy0wa6j,5,t5_2ymn6

6022950,0,t1_cy8slqw,This is probably an oddball recommendation but Ive found WarHammer  Space Marine to be the best thing Ive trained on.  Its fun and takes away a lot of the depth and complexity of the other listed games which is great for learning the SC.  You dont need to worry about character development minimaps weaponswapping resourcemanagement etc while getting used to touchpads and gyroaim.        Linear gameplay no accidentally wandering into hard mobs  the difficulty scales up with your understanding of the SC You will use all the SC buttons but you will not be craving more buttons.  Further all the buttons will likely be frequently used to keep your memory going. This will train you with the gyro without punishing you for not doing well. You will have to swap backandforth frequently from your right touchpad to the buttons.  This is one of the bigger learning curves I hit.  Starting out I hit Y when trying to hit X. Great mix of gunplay aiming and standard beatem up You arent worrying about inventory management or anything that distracts from pure action The beginning areas are PERFECT for tweaking your SC without getting killed Popping up the steam menu automatically pauses the game System requirements are lower relative to something like Shadows of Mordor Shorter campaign  by the time it ends you should be good enough with the SC to start liking it Nonstop waves of action so you can tweak jump into action tweak some more etc with very little downtime. You dont waste a stellar game like Shadows of Mordor being frustrated learning the SC. The gamepad with MouseJoystick template works outofthebox pretty much so you dont get frustrated spending a long time before enjoying your new SC.  Just make sure to spend  seconds to update your mouse sensitivity ingame and add the mousejoystick setting to the Gyro. Easy enough without being boring.

6114267,0,t3_3zazgh,Multikey is possible but thats more for combos like ctrla or something because all keys are executed each time you press the button theyre not cycled one to the next and back. This might be a feature request youd want to send to Valve sounds like it could be possible if enabling multi key brings up an option to fire all or cycle keysWhat youre asking for requires the game to support the same key for multiple different actions. Usually with keyboard support games will use different keys for these actions but with controllers theyll assign them to the same button since controllers have limited buttons.If the game allows you to set the same key for different actions then yes that should work. Or if the game has one key to toggle crouchpronestand in cycle that will work. But the controller alone is not going to be able to enable something like this.You might have some luck with mode shifting set the same button as crouch then mode shift it to prone. As long as the game toggles between crouchstand or pronestand that should work otherwise youll need a stand button still. ,SteamController,cykmnq8,6,t5_2ymn6

6830851,0,t3_3y11jj,A little follow up . . .  It turns out this still doesnt work for HyperSpin.  Im no programmer but there are too many programs involved because HyperSpin is also a frontend launcher.  Launching Xpadder from a Steam shortcut works to get the navigation of HyperSpin working but it still doesnt show the Steam Controller in Windows as any type of controller.  Its actually possible to get HyperSpin to detect the controllers momentarily but as soon as you try to configure RocketLauncher HyperSpins configuration UI the connection to the controllers reverts to keyboard and mouse.I bought my Steam controllers mainly for HyperSpin and Kodi.  HyperSpin is gonna be impossible without the Steam controllers being detected in Windows AS game controllers of some type.  I dont know for sure about Kodi but I do know it would also be much much easier and better if Windows could really see the controllers as controllers.It absolutely boggles my mind why Steam would do this.  They lose a lot of retrogamers AND HTPC people this way.  The sure as heck lose the retrogaming HTPC folks.Ironicallly Steam suports third party controllers like Xbox  and PS and most generic ones.  That being the case why in the world would they not make their awesome controller available to the outside world?  Theyre letting the whole outside world IN after all.  Why not let their controller out  like without a curfew so to speak?  Weirdest thing in the world . . . and its also driving me nuts because I can return these two otherwise AWESOME controllers and just order a couple of Logitechs or whatever but it just seems so damn wrong.  I just cant get over it.  They really dont want me to drive HyperSpin with the great Steam Controller?  Just why??,SteamController,d0qkst0,1,t5_2ymn6

Thats actually kind of cool if you are like me and use both an Xbox controller and a Steam Controller based on what game you are playing.

8209175,0,t3_4rs12q,Hey soxinthebox welcome to the Mac SC club. Ive seen some hitormiss responses to the experience but we definitely seem to have a buggier time than our Windows counterparts. Overall Ive enjoyed mine the last  months so maybe we can figure out how to make things better.First thing I need to point out though one of the biggest bugs plaguing Mac SC users The modifier keys do not work correctly on Mac. Shift control altoption amp windowscommand all trigger something else than they are meant to the media keys as well. Some output nothing others F and a few random ones watch out for the windows key  it acts like the power button. So right of the bat any configurations you were using that rely on hotkeys with those keys will not work correctly. Some of those games might have ingame hotkey options you can use to work around the issue while with others youll be stuck for now.There might be some other bug related issues jtnix has been compiling some on the Steam community forums quick search there and here should dig up some others.Bugs aside your mileage with the community configs can vary. Often the toprated configs may not be the best most thought out even use the most recent SC functionality but were just some of the first to upload instead. A little digging for better configs can help and if you have the time for it modifyingbuilding your own configs can be really satisfying. Other than that what specific games have you been having trouble with? Others here might have some experience with those same issues. Also what computer are you running on? Newer ones should be fine but olderless powerful Macs might have some performance quirks.

About occasional drift you need to recalibrate your controller you do this in big picture mode options gt controller gt add test gt your controller gt calibrate.Edit I just tested it in the desktop environment amp I hate it because the mouse isnt that detailed better word please instead it basically takes lots of small jumps while moving it around.

9493392,0,t3_5asvv3,Very quickly. But Im almost a poster child for SC  cause I like gamepads I prefer using them and I played a lot of Wii games and even couple of PS games like Flower. And SC is way better then those two.Still there are things everyone need to figure out for themselves. Personally I think putting gyro on right pad touch or always on is insanity  Big advantage of playing with any gamepad is ability to move hands freely and I cant do that with gyro on. On the other hand I very rarely adjust any other settings usually when there is a problem.Speaking of which be sure there is no problem. For some time gyro mouse was working fine but gyro mouse like joystick was very jittery for me and it wasnt game or settings problem it was Steam overlay I think problem.And a lot of it depends on a game too. Im not gonna name any names but some games are just awkward to control. With SC gamepad or KBampM. Sometimes by design survival horror games do that all the time. You can mitigate a lot of it with SC actually but not all of it.I know I rambling now and its not very helpful. But since its not very specific question you have its hard to give anything other than general advice and encouragement.

9754643,0,t1_daezihk,This is a good move for a lot of games without simultaneous xinput amp kbm input. MGSV for instance. One of the problems Ive had with it though is that I would sometimes get false positive action set changes leaving me in the wrong action set for the context. For the above example if you were to press B during a loading screen you would enter the Pipboy action set leaving you with the wrong config when the game loads. Its awkward to flip back to the correct action set when this happens. I found a really simple workaround though  In your Pipboy AS bind one of the grips to switch to the primary AS. You probably dont need the grips for menu functions anyway and this allows you to quickly switch back to the main AS as needed. ,SteamController,dafh87g,5,t5_2ymn6

Assuming you have it setup remote to your desktop in another room somehow?,SteamController,dbxihjq,2,t5_2ymn6
10177103,0,t1_dbxihjq, Yes every one of my friends who has a Dualshock  or a Steam Controller have expressed higher interest in playing titles on their pc on their couch or in their livingrooms. None Cable TVs dying quicker than the newspaperMy personal setup is through Big Picture Mode. I launch emulators and watch my personal film collection through Kodi. I built an sffpc last year with the intent of having a game console sized pc that was on par if not better than my previous build. It turned out to be much better and for half the price. Small Form Factor PCs or HTPCs are trending more than ever before and its only going to continue to grow. Steam Machines and Valves experimentation with funding and interacting with interesting third party developers are all exciting on their own and are in their own way helping to bring a certain type of market to be interested in using pcs in this way. Nearly all of the major pc hardware companies are branching themselves into small form factor or mini itx catered parts. Corsair for example finally made their entry last year with  power supplies and their own case which bolsters water cooling. Projects being funded from Hard Forum are finding success and that success seeps its way into popular pc enthusiast discussion areas of the internet on a consistent basis. Even Valve made their very own steam machine well the case at least and gave it to  random people along with Steam Controllers back  years ago for beta testing. That case alone has inspired quite a lot of individuals and case manufacturers as quite a lot of them blatantly address it. HTPC enthusiasts typically drool over it.Valve themselves are extremely alert of htpcs and what makes them attractive. Pretty sure Gabe Newell himself has gone on record back when Valve was in its early days as to saying how awesome itd be for common folk to see computers as game consoles and while that was in a more softwaregoods kind of ideal Im sure I think its seeped its interests into literal consoletype environmental thinking. But Valves done things such as communicate with the Kodi dev team add support for it on the SteamLink add support for Mame on the SteamLink the icons for touch menus for steam controllers even have icons such as mushrooms and joysticks and we all know what game series utilizes mushrooms. On top of that they read the posts on this sub and read the discordirc and most emulators out there work naturally with steam controllers support. On top of all this nearly every controller out there is getting Steam Controller API support. The perfect emulation setup with no need to install xinput wrappers for your other controllers is later this year or even in  developers will abandon xinput and it will finally die.I usually recommend newcomers to the Steam Controller to put themselves away from their pc and mouse and keyboard maybe youve seen my posts where Ive said or recommended that if not we both have a pretty darn similar mindset. Its the only way to learn to use this controller efficiently. But anyway I strongly recommend installing Kodi and getting a setup going for that. Browsing the Windows interface and Steam Desktop while more than a foot away from the display makes me feel like its  years ago again before Big Picture Mode existed and when Dualshock  support on PC gave everybody Chinese viruses.,SteamController,dbxmpvc,3,t5_2ymn6

10576505,0,t3_5relny,Agree with most of this stuff. My comments LPadLStick Configuration swap  break configuration into controller units. Some people like using the pad some people like using the stick. In almost every case whatever you want requires you to have to reprogram both which is a tedious mess when all you really want to do is swap the pad with the stick. Added bonus if you include gyroRPad and can just movecopy things around. Make it as easy to swap as invert mouse look. Let us program lizard mode New Pad configuration mode Gesture Pad. I want the right pad to be a touchpad with gesture support. Tap doubletap long tap swipe leftrightupdown. Outer ring tapdoublelong outer ring wheel scroll updown. So many intuitive possibilities can live on a Pad if it was just a big button with gestures. You can do some of this in mouse mode but its not great I dont want mouse input just gestures. Clickunder pad menus Basically a menu that lives under a pad click. Clickhold pops up the menu release registers the menu item. New feature Configuration manifest file. Basically let each game expose the actions in their game and the default bindings in some form of configuration file. Each entry in the file would define an controller action that the game understands with ltCommon Name Default Key or mouse click  xinput buttongt. SCC then parses this file and exposes it when binding a key. Instead of choosing a key on the keyboard and painstakingly looking up what is bound to what in the game for every key let the user just pick the action from the manifest file.

If you set an event that must go off when you completely let go of a trigger if you let up on the trigger too quickly it will often skip the Release Press event.This causes issues in games such as For Honor where you might want to use a separate action set for when youre lockedon in combat.

11000292,0,t3_5x1rcd,While the Steam Configurator renders most of this moot I really like the concept here.  This is basically the ultimate fuck you to developers that insist on shitty unchangeable control schemes especially those that rely on shitty controls for competitive balance.  With For Honor on console for example counterguardbreaking and dodging is far more difficult as you have to take your thumb off of the right stick first.  By being able to bind those to more sane places by being able to move the largely useless Quick Chat button somewhere else this makes the game control so much better.The shape of the rear grips also intrigues me.  I can handle the SCs rear grips just fine and I love them for their utility but many people complain about how they accidentally activate them all the time.  I havent had that problem but I imagine Im adjusting my grip to avoid that.  An SC . with grip buttons that are harder to accidentally hit would be great.  I dont know if the All Controller actually does anything special since I havent held it in my hands and I havent seen anyone really review it but if they solved that problem without making the grips any less responsive or comfortable or appropriate for primary and timesensitive actions then its worth getting excited for.I dont see it succeeding on PC where its configuration options are pointless but if the price is right I have nothing against console players gaining more control over how they play their games.,SteamController,deeumil,1,t5_2ymn6

Probably wont work if the game reacts to any controller this way.I remember that the Steam overlay nor the proper SC functionality would work in this game if I tried to inject ReShade using the dxgi.dll so it is something to try if you really want this.The latest Nvidia drivers seem to have broken ReShade support completely in this game though the game will fail to launch altogether.,SteamController,dez3bly,1,t5_2ymn6

Id either go with a keyboard and mouse setup or just use another gamepad probably my PS controller.Especially now that the PS controller has official support and you can bind the gamepad and touchpad for it. I do occasionally use it for games where the touchpad is a bigger hindrance than benefit or in games like platformers with few buttons or when the right stick only controls the camera and isnt used for aiming anyway.My Steam Controller is my favorite PC gamepad but the PS controller is a close second after the update that lets me bind it how I want and make use of the gyro program action sets and set activators with it as well. Its almost as good as the Steam Pad since you can now teak aiming using the gyro functionality and set up the touchpad for menu navigation but those grip triggers make a difference.
