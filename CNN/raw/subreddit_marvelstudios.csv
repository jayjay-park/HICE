Marvel cut a small reference to Hank Pym from Thor partially because they were worried about contradicting a future AntMan film. Winter Soldier has a far more blatant reference to Doctor Strange than Thor wouldve. That should tell you that Marvel is confident enough with their Strange development that theyre not worried about hindering it with a reference.I remember reading several months ago someone got their hands on one version of a Doctor Strange draft amp supposedly the first scene is set immediately following Iron Man Strange reads a paper with Starks I am Iron Man on the cover.

Maybe theyll break away from it now that hes mentally different from IM but he deserves a beat that plays which you can immediately associate with him due to his iconic nature something that could have worked with a guitar drum and bass and have a sound that could be essentially taken if they need to mould his future suited styles.The music goes a long way to giving a vibe for me in a film.

With some of the rumors going around about the type of actors Marvel are interested in the role Hamm Depp GordonLevitt Leto its hard to see them going for such a smaller actor instead.

1598801,0,t1_cjgoeh2,Heres my theory so bear with me Thanos sends Loki down to get an Infinity Gem Tesseract and doesnt want him to fail right? So Thanos gives him a staff that only Thanos knows the true power of which is powered remotely by the one Gem Thanos already has Mind Gem. This allows Loki to take control of anyone who stands in his way and also allows him to easily command the Chitauri army.NOW we are facing a couple of issues with my theory so let me address them First what is powering the Staff Well I think the staff is powered remotely by the Mind Gem. It wouldnt make sense for the staff to be powered by a Gem that Thanos doesnt have access to Tesseract. Plus the staff doesnt exhibit any abilities of the Space Gem at all as far as weve seen. The only thing it does is breach the Tesseract portal to turn it off but I believe thats because its powered by another Gem not because its powered by the Space Gem. Same energy signatures Because they are both Infinity Gems not because theyre the same thing. You have to keep in mind that all of the data about the Gems we hear in The Avengers comes from humans with no concept of the Gems and are limited by our basic human equipment. So even though they share similar energy signatures thats only because they have a similar origin and thats as far as we can detect. Saying items as mystical and as powerful as the Infinite Gems are the same because they have similar signatures is like saying two things that are the same color are the same. Ironic considering how many people say theyre the same because theyre both blue. works like a Hydra weapon This is said by Cap who has the technical understanding of a child when it comes to even basic technology at this point. All hes really saying is Its powered by some kind of magic like HYDRA weapons were because they didnt fire bullets. So while hes got the basic idea down he doesnt know what hes talking about and isnt qualified anyway.So do I believe the Space Gem is powering the Staff? No not at all. The Space Gem doesnt have mind control capabilities it can open up portals and siphon energy from the universe thats it. It would make sense for Thanos to already have the Mind Gem for more than one reason. First because how many movies really need their own Gem? How would a mind control plot even fit into a movie? Im sure Marvel can do it but why waste the time? Second Thanos going after the Mind Gem would allow him to take control of anyone he needed which would make things a lot easier to get the rest of the Gems. Third HYDRA using the Staffs power to unlock the miracles wouldnt make any sense at all if it were the Space Gem. But the Mind Gem is capable of unlocking all sorts of abilities the wiki specifically lists telepathy and other telepathic powers. To boot HYDRA could unlock powers with it and then use it to control the powered people as needed.,marvelstudios,cjgp4t7,2,t5_2uii8

Nathan Fillion was indeed the blue guy who got nosed raped.  Josh Brolin was the only thing performance captured in the film. James Gunn mentions that Gamora and Nebula have other siblings as well.

Its a cleaner read than some others because the New Yorker made sure it got nice and polished before they published it.  Its shorter than many others and its a great way to get into his voice and style. Hulk on Tangible Details  This is essential.  Its an earlier piece and he hadnt quite figured out his Hulk voice yet but this is fundamental to understanding his approach to talking about moviesand how so many mistake what really bothers them about a film.  Absolutely a must. The Age of the Convoluted Blockbuster  Hulk smashes the trend of adding unnecessary twists and turns into movies that dont need them.

I didnt say that were never getting Iron Man  although it is a very real possibility I said that there are no immediate plans for it. Considering this RDJs contract and Marvel being planned up to  it puts the movie if it happens  years away.Yes the  Rings have been around since IM. I never said anything to the contrary. Im saying that they werent anything special  they were just a generic terrorist cell. In none of the movies is it ever suggested not even a little that there was a real Mandarin out there. Im pretty sure that they outright state that Killian andor Trevor completely made up the Mandarin. There being a real one was retroactively put in there in All Hail the King  it was retconned in.The point that you seem to be repeatedly missing is that putting that in there was just throwing a bone to the people who were pissed about IM.

1936585,0,t3_2gu3y1,Theres only a dozen or so heroes no secret identities not enough time to do the whole story no central spiderman character for the story to revolve around and really its just not that good of a story. Sure its not a bad concept but the execution wasnt great and the writing forced characters to act out of character just to set up the story they wanted. I think most people that want it really only want it because they are relatively young and this was the biggest Marvel event that they can remember happening in their lifetime. One of the problems Marvel has in comics and the movies have been doing this too mostly is that they have great heroes with great character personality and motivations but the villains tend to suck. Sure there are guys like Magneto and Doom but for the most part they are kinda one note and you dont really care about them one way or another. They exist only to create problems for the heroes. So how do you make people care about the events you make it hero vs hero even if it doesnt make the most sense.

2363066,0,t1_cm3oll3,How exactly is what youre saying any different to some DC fanboy blindly defending the DC slate without any evidence of its quality? Like the DC fanboy youve made a blanket assumption about the DC slate albeit in a more pessimistic one without knowing ANYTHING about the quality of those films beyond your opinions regarding Man of Steel. How can you go ahead and say I thought MoS was soulless therefore the entire DC slate is going to be a mess that will never reach the heights of the MCU? I mean that doesnt make any sense and its doing exactly what James Gunn was trying to not do  prejudge the DC films.So you thought Man of Steel was a soulless fumble? Great. Youre completely entitled to that opinion  but that opinion shouldnt extend beyond that particular film. I know where youre coming from though youre saying that Man of Steel is the ground work on which the DCCU is being built and that the quality of said groundwork might give us a pretty clear indication as to what that cinematic universe and the all the films within it e.i. the announced slate will be like. Maybe but we dont know that for sure yet. Its not a fair call to make as it wouldnt be giving those films and the filmmakers making them a fair chance to present their vision and prove themselves on their own merits. If after  or so films you notice a distinct trend in the DCCU films and you havent enjoyed a single one of them then sure make a judgement. But for now one film simply isnt enough to automatically prejudge an entire slate.I mean let me give you an example. You know what I personally thought was pretty soulless? The  Incredible Hulk. Sure it was serviceable action movie and did a fine enough job of rebooting the Hulks origin story but it wasnt anything beyond that. The humour was sparse and ineffective the characters were dull and uncharismatic and the plot was a generic manonthelam scenario that jumped from uninspired setpiece to uninspired setpiece. It was overall forgettable when it shouldve been anything but. Hell the only memorable scene in that entire film was a short post credits scene featuring Tony Stark approaching General Ross in a bar. Thats pretty lackluster. After seeing that movie I could have easily said wow Marvel really dont know what theyre doing with the Hulk do they? What a mess. How the hell are they supposed to do an Avengers movie when they cant even handle what is essentially a Jekyll and Hyde story without dropping the ball? Sure Iron Man was pretty decent but if they cant do any other character whats the point? Maybe Jon Favreau was the only thing holding that movie together? This definitely isnt a good sign for this shared universe theyre attempting. See how silly that sounds in hindsight? I could have used that underwhelming film or one of the other underwhelming ones I wasnt huge on Iron Man  or Thor either as an excuse to prejudge the rest of the MCU without seeing them but lucky I didnt. As it turns out Marvel was just finding their feet at that point seeing what worked and what didnt. They eventually learned from their misstep with the Incredible Hulk and made the Hulk one of the most enjoyable parts of The Avengers. Whos to say DCWB haventwont learn from Man of Steel? I mean they went ahead and got an academy award winning screenwriter for Batman v Superman to replace David Goyer  whos script people often cite as the biggest issue with Man of Steel. That looks a helluva lot like learning from their misstep to me. But who knows? We should give DCWB a chance to find their feet like Marvel Studios did. In the mean time lets just take a step back and do as Mr Gunn is suggesting  hold our judgement until we actually see all of these movies.,marvelstudios,cm3s9vr,14,t5_2uii8

2565639,0,t3_2p511x,I didnt finish reading Infinity War but the movie will most likely be based on Infinity Gauntlet which is the first story of Thanos using the gauntlet. So I will summarize that Silver Surfer rushes to earth and crash lands in Doctor Stranges living room to warn him about Thanos Adam Warlock talks to Doctor Strange telepathically telling Strange that he Warlock has a plan and needs the cooperation of Earths heroes Thanos goes to Lady Death and tries to impress her with the power he has but she doesnt care Mephisto is by Thanos side I dont know why must have been explained in another comic Mephisto convinces Thanos that he needs to show Death his power So with a snap of his fingers he erases half of the population of the universe the ENTIRE universe Earth is in a panic as half the people disappear without a trace including some heroes like Hawkeye Doctor Strange and Adam Warlock gather the remaining heroes and even villains Doctor Doom and plan an assault against Thanos Thanos whoops everyone that tries to fight him including cosmic beings like Galactus and Eternity Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer are waiting and watching the fight from the sidelines warlock manages to block Thanos from seeing them since he is too busy fighting.  He reveals that his plan was to use the others as a distraction they stood no chance at all but fought anyway When the moment is right Warlock tells Surfer to fly as fast as he can and try to take the gauntlet off of Thanos hand but he fails and is killed In the end Thanos has beaten everyone and decides to transcend his body and become pure consciousness This whole time the zombielike nearly dead Nebula has been shambling around Thanos did it to try and please Death yea hes a psycho When Thanos leaves his body vulnerable she takes the Gauntlet and now the remaining heroes try to fight her since shes a psycho too She decides to turn back time to how things were  hours ago. But she doesnt realize that she was a corpse  hours ago The gauntlet falls to the floor and everyone leaps for it Adam Warlock gets it and fixes everything Thanos retires and is living on a farm yes reallyThe sequel story Infinity War is a different story where Thanos teams up with the heroes to stop the Magus from destroying the universe. My thoughts most people think Loki will take Mephistos role as Thanos right hand man who eventually tries to take the gauntlet from him and dies. Not sure which villain should be fighting with the heroes. There are a lot of choices. Adam Warlock is an absolute must since he and Thanos have a lot of history together. ,marvelstudios,cmtgubd,15,t5_2uii8

2571476,0,t3_2p511x,I posted this in another thread about why the original Infinity Gauntlet storyline would need major adaptation to work as a movieThe original story was basically all the heroes get toyed with and brushed aside by Thanos then every cosmic being in the  universe most of whom are unlikely to have been introduced in the MCU by the time of Infinity War gang up on him and start throwing around planets and breaking reality and such making it even more obvious how insignificant the heroes are then somewhat contrived but psychologically interesting Deus Ex Machina its implied that part of the reason Thanos lost is that he subconsciously wanted to.

Considering that he lives in New York.Im not as literate with the specific chronology as some are so Im not sure how much time passes between the Battle of New York and CATWS. Its very possible that by the time of Avengers  Stephens already training with the Ancient One maybe even nearing the end of his studies. Assuming that some showdown happens between Mordo and Strange over the Ancient One as it so often does in tales of his origin that would give SHIELD enough time to catch wind of him and start keeping tabs on the hoary host himself. ,marvelstudios,cmu9km0,0,t5_2uii8

The Avengers  Guardians of the Galaxy  Captain America The Winter Soldier  Iron Man  Captain America The First Avenger  Thor  Iron Man  Thor The Dark World  The Incredible Hulk  Iron Man   I got IM above Thor  cause we see the introduction of Black Widow and Warmachine and some of the action set pieces are pretty cool.  Hulk above IM cause it was a reimagining of the big guy and there are also some cool action sequences. IM is my least favorite because Tony removes the reactor from his chest uses remote controlled armor all day long this version of the Mandarin sucks Killian sucks harder and Tony is saved in the end by Peppers self learned Kung FU.

It will be only  years from the end of Winter soldier to Civil War. I am sure it will pick up from the end of the stinger in which he is trying to figure out who he really is and what happened to himwhat did he do while brain washed to finally come to help Steve in the big third act that all of these movies have. Falcon is obviously on Capts. And all teams are rumored. I havent heard anything about the twins appearing in the movie in anything more then cameo.  As far as Hawkeye considering the scene he was supposed to have in Winter Soldier   and the rumor of Black Widow he will definitely be on Capts team.

Where he was in life from where we last saw him and the guilt he will receive by the end of AoU going into Civil War he will be more determined than ever to do the right thing even if he is being told by many he is wrong. His ego will always be his downfall. The same goes for Cap. He still isnt use to the present day and still thinks in his old ways. He is one of the most determined guys in the MCU and that determination will be his downfall too. I just hope Marvel realise this and bring up the good and bad points of each argument.

Cosmic Marvel always goes inandout of vogue.The most consistent Marvel genres across their whole publication history would be High Science Fantastic Four Iron Man Avengers etc. Espionage amp Warfare Captain America SHIELD etc. Mythological Thor mostly but also Namor amp Hercules Horror amp Magical Ghost Rider Doctor Strange Blade etc. Cosmic Silver Surfer Adam Warlock Guardians of the Galaxy etc. Street Daredevil Heroes for Hire etc. Outsiders mostly Spidey amp Hulk they easily flit across all genres except cosmic XMen basically a miniuniverse unto themselves encompassing all other genresIf I had to break down DC it would be Batman Everything else,marvelstudios,co95frn,0,t5_2uii8

3030726,0,t1_cobcrz1,The mental block idea could work if it does have to be that particular Stone. But then it is equally as plausible that any of the Stones have enough cosmic power to unlock human abilities. Maybe the abilities that manifest depend on the Stone use.I dont know. At this point I dont think we really know about about the MCU versions of the Stones to say for sure. Hell do we even know that they are sticking to it  and using the same Stones from the comics that is do we know that they will be the SpaceMindPowerTimeRealitySoul Stones or could they shake it up a bit by making one of them represent something else?Another thing that I have considered is that the scepter could be a baitandswitch sort of thing. Like they do say in The Avengers that it is powered by the Tesseract but what if they have it backward somehow? Maybe the scepter is the real Space Gem with the Tesseract being an aspect of it. Or maybe its just that the scepter itself is an aspect of the Space Gem which was somehow divided into two or something that could explain why they both have the same color even though there is only one blue Stone. Another way of looking at it is that when Fury said that the scepter was powered by the Tesseract he meant the literal lasershooting scepter but not the Stone embedded in it.Lots of possibilities here.Or it could just not be an Infinity Stone.

To be honest I dont really expect the OneShots to amount to much in the long run especially since they seem to not be making anymore. To me they seem to be more like fun little extras as opposed to significant plot elements that they will shackle themselves to while making the larger productions. Hell the Agent Carter TV series already may or may not retcon the OneShot out of existence.For instance people often say that they want the real Mandarin from All Hail the King to show up but it would seem a little weird no to have this new traditionally Iron Mancentric Big Bad be a character whose start was getting namedropped in a fifteenminute extra on a Thor BluRay? Especially after already being personified in a previous movie.Like I barely expect the AoS characters to turn up in the movies. Certain not Benny and Claire from Item . Consider the general audience and the casual moviegoers  how many of them have even seen the OneShots? I mean I know that they wouldnt have to play an overtly important role in the story but still.

One of her superpowers is that she can secrete pheromones to have people do her bidding and like her she even gets the Hulk to make her a sandwich  so how does she know anyone actually likes her and its not just her powers? Besides Natasha doesnt have superpowers. Shes been trained and was an insanely talented assassin but because of Jessicas superpowers she was used as a major bioweapon for Hydra. Eventually Jessica quits being a superhero and decides to join the PI game She was so caught up with Hydras major plans of action that she finds that working on personal cases for the general people of the world is much more her speed. She does become a superhero again  and thats because shes too powerful of a character for her to not be an Avenger. In recent years shes been one of their most prominent members. She was the only Avenger besides Wolverine to be called an Agent of SWORD. This is because of how messed up her life is.Even beyond all of her history and superpowers and tragic story Jessica is very close friends with Carol Danvers. We dont even need a SpiderWoman movie  since Carol is getting her movie soon it would just be so dope to get to see their friendship on the big screen. Fuck the Science Bros Carol and Jessica are the best of friends and have the best relationship TLDR Jessica Drew is a dope character that would be awesome to watch in the MCU.,marvelstudios,cour2wt,3,t5_2uii8

3215410,0,t3_2wxhvv,The entire sinister  dont need back story on all of them just have Venom break them out of one of the major super villain prisons. We can learn about them through their banter arguments and poor team work together. Obviously SpiderMan needs to be blamed for the outbreak by the media and posed as a menace because thats his whole deal and its insane that that wasnt touched upon in The Amazing SpiderMan not having Jameson should be considered a sin. Anyway with the entire sinister six and SpiderMan made out to be a menace the last thing we need for it to feel like a Spidey comic is a cool team up SpiderMan being back in the MCU needs to be taken advantage of not using existing characters would just defeat the point of it coming back. I think one of the escaped prisoners should be Hulk after being imprisoned due to losing control in Ultron thats all assumptions then we get a SpideyHulk team up vs the Sinister Six and a cute scene of Spidey telling the Hulk that even if the world thinks were monsters and menaces it doesnt matter as long as we know were doing good.

3244561,0,t1_coyaag0,gt  It was suppose to be in good fun but per usual the people on this subreddit dont like it because they cant take a jokeActually it was because the joke was bad. I wrote a comment explaining why that you can read here For evidence that this sub can take a joke just go to almost every other thread on this subreddit ever.gt which happens any time I make a little funny about their precious AoS.Did an AoS fan harm you in some way? Its a really unrelated thing to keep bringing up.gt It wasnt a bad joke though in my opinion.And in the opinions of several others it was.gt  I suspect that you put on this serious act to feed your ego as someone who has some deep profound insight that you must share with the worldI was serious because you seemed to genuinely not get why other people thought your joke was bad. Also I thought the joke was based in an actual opinion you had since it was at DCs expense for no reason. So I wanted to discuss that opinion. Apparently you dont have that opinion. Which makes me wonder why even bring up DC at all? Is it like AoS where you bring it up to bash at random even though you dont actually have any real reason to?gt pull out the sarcasm because you are a smart dudeI actually keep my sarcasm on my desk next to my computer right next to my trophy for being a smart dude Seriously though Im just sarcastic sometimes because it makes commenting more fun.gt and hey you cant let me get away with saying that so you will make some snarky cheap comeback that will show me!My snarky cheap comebacks have all addressed more than one point. Also I did let you get away with saying everything. I would have reported your comments if I felt they really shouldnt be here. I also dont want to show you.gt And then I wont respond and that will be that. Hey that reminds me didnt you say you were done with this sub? Have you gotten over that were you lying or did some third thing bring you back? Anyway Im fine with replies. I wanted to talk about the joke in the first place anyway.gt My point is this subreddit is absolutely hostile to anyone who doesnt drink the koolaid and Im tired of it.I think a problem with this sub is all the DC bashing. Im not looking forward to the DC movies but I come here to talk about Marvel not DC. My point is how is me defending DC drinking the koolaid? If anything I found your joke to be a perfect example of the posts on this sub I like the least. They dont add to a discussion theyre kind of offtopic they bash DC for no reason they arent funny but try to be and they have memes. But yeah my post that I actually put thought into is the kind this sub needs less of.gt  I want to joke aroundThen tell good jokes.gt as well as have in depth conversations about the things I love with other people who share in my passionIf you dont want a discussion about things you dont love dont bring them up.gt not receive hate for dissenting opinionsYou didnt get hate at least from me. Also again disliking DC is really a dissenting opinion here its just something most people are sick of talking about. And you didnt receive hate for your opinion you received hate for your bad joke.gt little jokes that are in no way suppose to be hostile towards anyone.A bad little joke is still a bad joke. And your joke included the phrase We seriously hate you guys. If you didnt want to come off as hostile your joke shouldnt have included a declaration of serious hate. Not to mention it made Marvel look like the bad guy what with the troll face and all.gt what this subreddit does is make people feel bad for thinking outside the box or inside the boxIt was more about your joke than your opinion.gt So to you I say good day sir. no. please. come back.,marvelstudios,coyb1t5,1,t5_2uii8

But then Asgardians have also visited the collector in the Andromeda galaxy which would be a more accomplishable feat if another one of the realms was in the galaxy.

3422456,0,t3_2zf09q,Eh. Maybe Im just biased but I dont ever expect superdeep or complex villains out of the MCU but I still tend to enjoy what were given very much. At this point I would probably say that Loki and Pierce and then Killian are probably the most complex movie villains that weve had and a really liked them all and appreciated that depth. But I didnt go in expecting it. For me it was just a pleasant surprise for them to go a little further than usual with it.But then sometimes I think you need a simple villain or at least not necessarily one with any elaborate development simply because the story is about something else. Like in GOTG  I dont really mind that Ronan is just a xenophobic fanatic it moves the plot along and gives the Guardians something to unite against as its more their story anyway. But yet I still enjoy Ronan in the story. Ive been told that the comics Ronan was much more complex but I dont think the movie really needed that. This may or may not be an unpopular opinion I dont know and I dont really care. GOTG worked and Ronan was still fun. Pace was great in the role. Basic or not I loved it.I would rank them but to be honest I enjoyed almost all of them. Vanko was lame though not because of Roarke certainly but I think he is the only one that I dont really like watching. Well him and the Abomination too I suppose. My favorites however have been Zola Killian Pierce Stane and Hammer. Red Skull was pretty cool too. Malekith looked awesome and was what Id call decent although I admit that I am still bitter that most of his dialogue was madeup gibberish. Chris is a good actor. Dont shaft him with that pointless crap.,marvelstudios,cpidvfg,4,t5_2uii8

3468914,0,t1_cpno2fl,Im not convinced that we have seen much beyond the first and possible middle act of the film in the trailers. Even if SW and QS join at the same time I still feel that QS will die. Also knowing Whedons penchant for killing off people coupled with the way he has talked about the film and some other comments by people like Feige I could see this movie being very deathheavy. I think that death is the best way for Marvel to deal with actors who may want out of the MCU even if they have only stated so privately to Marvel. I also think that death would have permanent repercussions be a driving point to move the other films along and be a very emotional tool to set up future events and drive sales.Pepper is my overall choice for death because it would be the most impactful. The reason I think that Rhodey may die is because at least to a general audience who are mostly not traditional comic book fans having two characters who are identical in many ways save for paint job is a bit boring and redundant. I could see Rhodes living only if Stark gives up his role as Iron Man to focus on working with the government and Rhodes becomes the new Iron Man because lets face it Iron Man is more popular than War Machine ... though I personally like the mostly silver War Machines paint job and name myself.I really wouldnt put it past Marvel to have a few oneoff heroes up their sleeves. I think it would work better for them to oneoff QS but I honestly do see a scenario where they use Vision to sacrifice himself to end Ultron. That being said it wouldnt surprise me if The Visions death is later retconned when they reveal that somehow his personality was downloaded with Ultron or something like that. I will be the first to admit when Im wrong but I just cant see a Marvel where they keep both of twins active since they have to share the rights with Fox. I think that they may kill QS just to spite the Mutant Cinematic Universe because they are focusing on QS and not SW. My guess is that at least one of the Avengers will die most likely Thor but I see potential for more deaths. The more we loose in AoU the greater impact the events of Civil War will have from the audiences perspective. I guess well just have to wait and see.,marvelstudios,cpnojc4,1,t5_2uii8

I think the TV show was a mistake.They arent compelling enough to each solo a movie but together theyd be a great AoS team. It couldve been done in a Mission ImpossibleAteam style and a great way to see why they are cool even without super powers instead of playing secondfiddle to the bigger heroes.

The Iron Legion was a waste of money and resources regardless of how much money Stark actually has it showed he is wasteful the movie itself shows that he is unstable mentally and wrecklesscareless with his own life and the lives of others. The only redeeming quality I see in the film is his ability to fix Pepper. Pretty much the rest of the film shows why he shouldnt be in charge of protecting anyone.

The out of towners most of the cosmic heroes aliens interdimensional beings and those otherwise above it all wont care much about the domestic politics of it. And the streetlevel heroes who have been watching the system fail all of their lives will line up against registration.It wont be the exact same events but its hard to see how they wouldnt follow the general outline.

3671554,0,t3_32fsp5,I would doubt any more shifts until after Infinity War. I definitely dont think its out of the realm of possibilities though.However Feige was quoted having said that the SpiderMan shift was already planned when they announced the lineup without him they were just waiting for the right moment to announce the MarvelSony partnership. So I dont really know if thats any indication...Personally I see AntMan as being a player in Civil War and maybe not warranting a sequel immediately. ,marvelstudios,cqas4m1,4,t5_2uii8

3673126,0,t3_32gf4h,I love how the clips released today of Tony seem to build on Iron Man .The Hulkbuster clip uploaded earlier shows how he is trying to build preemptive weapons to protect against future threats from the Hulk  or space. Its cool that the suit uses the same technology as the Mark  armour. This clip shows how he has inherited Nick Furys fear of cosmic threats and builds on his PTSD seen in IM. He may be the only Avenger who is thinking of the big picture and you can really see his motivation for building Ultron.

It leaves so much of it simply being perfunctory  the remaining scenes are there because for the sake of future MCU material let alone the core story they must be  or even badly paced or disjointed.

Wow geek overload. Unrelated Note Wife really likes Marvel but when Batman V Superman trailer played ... why are they fighting I thought they were both good. I had to remind her of Man of Steel. I am going to see it again but my initial thoughts were that it was a solid entry. I did feel it was a little rushed at points particularly with Ultron. Personally I would have enjoyed a bit more time with him expanding upon his character. James Spader was perfect for the role The wife even leaned over during the movie and said he makes such a great villain. She loves Blacklist too. Audience gasped at QuickSilver death. The whole room. The moment worked at least in our group. Perhaps an unpopular opinion but Im glad someone finally died hopefully for real Im also glad it was setup as a surprise in the film. Vision picking up the Hammer never saw that coming loved it.   What a great FUN way to have not only the other characters buy in that Yup he was just created but we can trust him but also the audience. Loved that they paused on that moment for a solid few frames to let us soak it in. Favorite Line Tony Go to Sleep during the HB fight. Question So is Theta Protocol the new Avengers facility?

You have to know whats coming to set it up and avoid future continuity concerns. And they definitely would have had more seeds for future plot lines if they knew how big this whole thing would blow up.

3923491,0,t3_35bi2m,A mix of all. Some characters can be recast some can be replaced by new heroes and some should just be written out.Steve Rogers could be replaced by another who becomes the second Captain America. Thor could be reincarnated into another body perhaps even the new female version. Iron Man should step down without replacement and allow other tech characters like Vision to shine. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk could carry on as a Btier character without the demanding stream of constant solo films and team films allowing him to act outside the franchise.As long as Marvel make sure they have at least a few main heroes on offer at any one time there is no reason they cant rotate characters in and out maybe bringing older characters back for a short reprise later down the line. Phase One and Two was very much Iron Man and Thor based Phase Three is looking to focus around Captain America more while introducing the marketting power house that is Spiderman. Once characters like Spiderman Dr Strange and Black Panther are established there is no reason Iron Man Thor and the Cap couldnt be retired or pushed back for a while. Further down the line reacquiring the F would be an amazing booster giving a new team the public are familiar with as well as two of the best villains in comic book history Galactus and Dr Doom to the roster.Essentially the franchise is reaching a point of make or break. If they can introduce new characters while fading our and replacing older ones well they will survive. If not things will start to get choppy dischordant and overcrowded pretty quickly. The balance is what is important.,marvelstudios,cr3iih6,1,t5_2uii8

Was that one of those?gtGunn I dont think that was why that was cut. I think that scene was just a long scene and it was the perfect length and having the vote which I like a lot just made it a little too long. So thats all that was. That was a hard decision to cut that. Just because we joke all the time  Chris Pratt and I are constantly making jokes  theres lots of stuff that we had to cut because it would have been jokes all of the time. There were times when Ronan and Nebula were funny that we cut because we didnt want it to seem like Spaceballs.gtSHH Now Ive got to see this!

3951922,0,t1_cr6lpri,Well the point is that we want castings and character introductions to be natural and when your source material originated in the s through the s there just isnt much diversity. I dont think that making a faithful adaptation of those characters constitutes as pandering to white men. So the question becomes do we shoehorn in some diversity for the sake of diversity? Obviously there is a middle ground. Forcing those characters in for the sake of diversity is just as bad of an option as keeping with the mostly whitemale castings. But most of us seem to agree that this really wont be a problem in a couple years and I say that based on known castings and characters to be introduced.,marvelstudios,cr6r47a,1,t5_2uii8

And keeping those readers means having a universe that looks like something theyve already seen.Dont get me wrong I love the films and MCU and its great that they give the directors and writers a good amount of freedom. I just wish the comics influenced the films a bit more instead of vice versa. Particularly I love Chris Pratt and the film but I prefer this version of Starlord. edit ALSO just so I can bitch about it to someone Ultrons origins are a little bothersome in the movie. I LOVE James Spader and I LOVED his Ultron despite other peoples disdain for him but it bothers me that theres a good amount of people believing that Ultrons real father is Tony.

4099085,0,t3_37ir5l,The two I want most who havent had films are SheHulk and Namor. SheHulk because it would bring an extra depth and dynamic to the Hulk as well as her general awesomeness as a character. Would love to see her and Matt Murdock going head to head in the courtroom and it would be another female hero which the universe has been crying out for.Namor because from the little I know about his character he just seems really interesting. I like his origin story Although for Namor to work he would have to have been around doing his own thing for a while unless they made and introduced him in an Invaders series which would be freaking awesome. I just like that with him he brings his own new civilisation. Plus hes also an arrogant dickbag which will contrast nicely with other characters in the MCU.I would also be interested to see Union Jack in some capacity I know his character was briefly seen in The First Avenger but being from the UK it would be nice to see a British Hero suited up and getting involved in the action I think that the name of Captain Britian alone would be too confusing for the casual movie goer... What? So they have a captain for every country now?Finally I just want to mention that although hes had his own films in the past I would really love to see Punisher in the MCU. Preferably on Netflix where there will be more freedom for the character.Edit Apologise my phone sent this twice.,marvelstudios,crnire6,3,t5_2uii8

4201048,0,t3_38zcfk,I think Darcy is funny in both Thor films. Despite the fact that Thor amp Jane Foster have the weakest romance after having rewatched the first Thor I can honestly say I see it. Its not great or anything but I do genuinely get why Thor would fall in love with Jane. Hes intrigued and humbled by her wideeyed enthusiasm for science and the outside world and feels she is very intelligent for a Midgardian having basically cracked the egg that is interdimensional travel before all of the rest of the scientific community. Even in The Dark World hes amused by how impressed she is by things that are so basic to him as an Asgardian despite the fact that she is considered a genius on Earth. Also Natalie Portman is cute so theres that.I think The Incredible Hulk is a genuinely good movie better than Thor amp Iron Man  and I dont understand why fans of the character would dislike it. It is pretty much exactly what I wanted from a Hulk film and it makes even the Bruce Banner segments of the movie which are usually the most boring parts interesting and suspenseful to watch because hes constantly being watched and ontherun. I mean the Favela chase scene at the beginning is one of the best chase scenes Ive seen in films period and it ends with one of the coolest Hulk scenes on film I would have preferred Mark Ruffalo over Edward Norton or for Norton to just continue into the Avengers but I love it either way. William Hurt as General Ross is perfect casting as well and Im so glad hell be back for Civil War.I want Marvel to retire the Iron Man character at some point after Infinity War if not kill him outright. I love RDJ and I love Iron Man but I cannot see them successfully replicating what he did with the character and I dont want them to prolong him to the point of being boring. In fact Id rather Marvel kill off every character they have than recast them after so long. It seems like such a waste to follow these actors as these characters for so many years only for Marvel to pull the rug out from under us and put Mark Wahlberg as Tony Stark or Alexander Skarsgard as Captain America.Not sure HOW unpopular this is in the grand scheme of things but the Black WidowHulk romance makes a ton of sense if you actually think about it. As characters theyre actually a lot alike even moreso than Widow and Hawkeye. Tortured souls and all that.I think Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is a good show.We should have gotten the rights to The Fantastic Four over Daredevil.

I dont know much about Moon Knight but maybe they could go the Khonshu was an alien ... similar to the Asgardians approach. The only issue I have with that is the fact that IF they turn everything in the MCU into alien or alien tech then it really makes the whole concept seem to be a cop out. Sure it works for Asgardians and Inhumans with the Kree experiments and what not but to me there needs to be other explanations for some things. ,marvelstudios,cs60rjb,-1,t5_2uii8

4400699,0,t1_csl7o89,How much have you read of Punisher? Because Im pretty sure from his introduction in SpiderMan to now hes had arcs where hes had character development. Maybe not in  version but in the various other versions. And the MCU doesnt draw on any particular version to define the characters. Some are based on more one version than others but some are entirely different than in the books. Note Im not trying to be a dick Im just asking because Im curious. Punisher is not completely irrational. He has a rational logic to his methods in fact. It is not the most intelligent logic but it is there. He hunts down and kills the bad guys all the while he tries to prevent harm from coming to innocents. Frank doesnt take hurting good people well. But he has almost a psychologically vampiric need to kill the bad. Ward also has a logic though not the most intelligent to his methods. He kills because he was taught that eliminating the threat is better than merely troubleshooting the situation. To him its better to kill the guy than to try to talk things out. But as Ward kills it has become similar for him to Frank an almost psychologically vampiric need to kill. Punisher initial reason for killing was revenge. Wards initial reason was because he was seeking acceptance. When Punisher finally killed those responsible for his familys murder he wasnt done ... because the act of revenge didnt feel that psychological need to kill. Therefore he continues to kill bad people to try and fill that psychologically vampiric need to kill. Ward killed to be accepted by Garrett and to a lesser extent Hydra. When Garrett was taken he too had an inner emotional hole. He had lost his family and still had this desperate need to be accepted. So he turned to killing to be accepted by Skye ... which didnt work out. Then he moved on to Kara. Similar results. Now it seems hes out to kill for the most selfish reason he can because he needs to kill. Both Frank and Ward have a sort of similarity to their stories. Both lost their families. Punisher to the mob Ward to S.H.I.E.L.D. who killed his family Garrett and Kara. Both kill to try to avenge in a way the loss of their family I say this because since Garretts death Ward has been kind of lost and continued to look for acceptance but deep inside he felt like he should avenge Garretts death. But it wasnt until the death of Kara that Ward realizes this. So you see they arent exact parallels but there are ironic similarities to both characters. ,marvelstudios,csloyu2,1,t5_2uii8

DC seems to have found its voice when it comes to tone and themes and they are doing well with Snyder. Complacency will only dismantle the throne they have built with DC snapping at their heels with killer titles and properties. Hopefully Marvel can mix up the palette with their rd phase. Dont mess with success but introduce new tones and somebody from Marvel actually please write a decent villain please! art style so in order to keep things from getting boring.

But XMen follow this structure too but what they use to separate it is ideology. MCU films differentiates it with setting and genres. MoS was pretty all other Superman films just with Superman being Dark Knight level serious. BvS switches it up a bit with the heroes but Im sure by the third act theyll realize Lex is the bad one. Civil War also does this and will probably leave more disfunction afterwards since the Justice League doesnt follow it the following year.

Id say he earned a lot more credit in something like earning an Academy Award nomination for The Lovely Bones.  Or even by appearing in something like the Hunger Games which had a much bigger audience.Let me put it this way if you ask an average movie goer what they know Stanley Tucci from what would they say theyve seen him in?

They are static flat and have little to no development. The TV side with Loeb seems to understand villains better.

4648001,0,t1_ctfqa8v,I dont really buy this though. The problem was not that Garfields Peter wasnt nerdy enough whatever that means. The problem was that he was too cool. He had far too much going for him and not enough going against him.You dont have to try and define what st nerdiness is exactly in order to perfectly portray Peter Parker. What was missing from Garfields portrayal was that there was no way that I could believe that he was some kind of social outcast. He has to have some problem some situation thats constantly making life difficult for him and yet Garfields version never convincingly showed this.Lets see hes extremely attractive with perfect hair he dresses like a fashion model he can skateboard hes a photographer hes incredibly smart a hot girl is in love with him hes constantly doing cool things.... taking that character and then trying to convince an audience to feel sorry for him and his situation well it doesnt work. Peter Parker should be a goodhearted likeable character whos constantly down on his luck and cant catch a break and yet Garfields Parker was basically this cool dude who was having awesome stuff happen to him but was whining about it all the time. Say what you will about the Raimi films but they knew how to throw real conflict at Peter Parker. Yea he played up Peter Parkers dorkiness a fair bit... because it worked for the audience to connect with him as this guy who wasnt that great socially but had a really good heart. Meanwhile Webb gave us a Peter Parker who cried because he had to promise a hot girls dead father that hed stay away from her for her own protection... and then went back on that promise because fuck you Mr. Stacy Im Spiderman and I get to have what I want because Spiderman is apparently not about responsibility anymore. Tobeys Peter Parker finally got the girl at the end of the first Spiderman movie and then walked away from her because he knew he couldnt be with her because he learned the lesson from his uncle. One of the major things wrong with the first ASM is that Garfields Peter Parker never has that moment... it has the complete opposite the promises are made to be broken bullshit. Thats the moment where his Peter Parker become a completely unlikeable character to me.And even when Gwen dies its not technically his fault so he just gets to mope around for a bit and then go back to being awesome because hes Spiderman. Becoming Spiderman shouldnt have made all his personal problems go away because that misses the entire point of the character and also is just not a very interesting story anyways.You dont have to make Peter Parker some supernerd in order for the character to work. But you cant make him some kind of cool hipster that everyone is in love with and then have people feel sorry for him when he mopes around. People dont connect well to stories about people who seem to have everything and yet continually whine and dont take responsibility for their actions.,marvelstudios,ctgfzuv,6,t5_2uii8

4680622,0,t1_ctkizum,I think its great as well.  Mostly because it was earmarked to be a flop.  It got slammed by a lot of press saying Antman?  Pffft Marvel is scraping the bottom of the barrel now really early in production before anyone saw it.  Add in the breakup with Edgar Wright script rewrites and an aggressive timetable from the start of shooting to big screen....it had a large chance to flop.  Especially since AntMan really isnt well known to a lot of people outside of the communities that take interest in comics or their related cartoons and TVMovie properties.  So the fact that it could make  Million once all the overseas markets open up is pretty cool.  A big win for Marvel and shows the power of the brand.Incredible Hulk gets such a bad rap and is probably considered their flop.  Its not the best Marvel movie but its no worse than IM or Thor TDW.  It released a month after Iron Man and people still had no idea they were connected.  If the Marvel brand was as strong then as it is now it would have made more.   Yes it made  million but thats including international.  It didnt equal its shooting budget domestically plus whatever needs to go to distributor Universal and the theaters themselves?  Thats the weakest MCU entry to date.  A movie would have to come out and be BAD for them to flop right now.  Maybe in  years after this trend of  comic property movies per year including DC and Fox people will just move on and not see the AntMan type flicks.  But for now they are strong and should move forward with confidence.,marvelstudios,ctkjfgn,3,t5_2uii8

Iron Man thinks that the world will be safer if everyone with superpowers can be kept in that registry.  It would end vigilantism and lead to more organized crime fighting that could be supported with unions or even tax money if theyre government funded.Cap thinks its a violation of human rights to force people to give up their right to privacy.

4762544,0,t1_ctuu3xd,Re Hulk distribution The Hulk can show up in ensemble films like Avengers Civil War Guardians etc it just cant be a Hulk movie. I imagine that would include his supporting cast SheHulk included. If the movie has Hulk in the title you can assume that Universal has some say in it. However Hulk and Namor should be able to show up anywhere else they want. Re QS and SW we dont know the details on this its unclear if they were a loophole in the contract ie something vague allowed them to sneak through and that means that other characters LIKE them could possibly follow suit or more likely they were specifically outlined in the deal as being in a gray area since they are so closely tied to The Avengers moreso than any other mutant. I expect it was just the case that Marvel and Fox both recognized the gray area they resided and had no qualms sharing them. I wouldnt use it to try and predict any future cooperations but it MIGHT signify a more murky rights division than we first thought. ,marvelstudios,ctuv36k,1,t5_2uii8

4787956,0,t3_3ggtm2,The MCU as it stands now does appear to be lacking in main female characters. ie not a single female character has had their own standalone movie But Id say Marvel is definitely taking steps in the right direction! Agent Carter was a huge step IMO because you have an entire show about a badass female whos clearly far more qualifies than her peers give her credit for just because shes a woman  its blatantly dealing with sexist bullshit and I love it. Even Agents of SHIELD has a female sort of lead. For all intents and purposes I feel that AOS is kind of shared between Coulson and Skye. Jessica Jones comes out this year which is again great because thats yet another strong female character whos going to be the star of her own show. And even in movies named after the male lead we still get badass females. A couple of years ago the only notable female character that didnt exist to just be a romantic interest to another male character was Black Widow but today we have Scarlet Witch Maria Hill and Hope. I love that were getting more and more female characters who get their own arc in the movies. And of course well be seeing Carol Danvers in a bit and thatll be the first MCU movie named after a female lead. A few years ago I was slightly upset at the severe lack of wellwritten female characters in the MCU but today I can see Marvel is definitely taking steps in the right direction!

It could run a few regularrealisticfluff articles but the main attraction would be fictional headlines about SpiderMan.Start off with a story about some kid being bitten by an experimental spider while on a trip to OsCorp have his school attempt to sue to make it hit actual news. Within the next few weeks you get SpiderMans debut wrestling match in the sportsentertainment recaps and Ben Parkers obituary the same day.As time goes on start running stories about a selfdeclared friendly neighborhood SpiderMan dealing with street thugs. The Bugle starts to publish opinion articles about him Hero or Menace?. Maybe drop a reference to the Netflix heroes now and again since theyre also pretty local to New York City. Before long SpiderMan becomes the headline almost every day. As the movie gets closer to release and perhaps going onward through Phase  they could run stories on SpiderMans fights against some of his other villains who wont make it to screen lets be honest Shocker is great and all but probably isnt going to be a villain on the silver screen so this could be an avenue to establish him in the MCU.It would be a lowpressure lowcost way of introducing Spidey and his rogues and wouldnt be intrusive for those who dont want to hear his origin story yet again.

4917282,0,t3_3i6p92,Most threatening? Because most people here seem to think that means most powerful. Which we all already know Thanos Ronin Malekith etc etc.In terms of the villains who were actually intimidating onscreen and whose actors owned their roles. Ultron. James Spaders the most viscerally satisfying intimidating and  I would argue  entertaining villain to date. His aloof disinterest clashes with his very human flaws like anger and jealousy just like his deadpan delivery clashes with his black semidetached humour. He was a treat to watch and its criminal that he wasnt given more time.. Winter Soldier. Sebastian Stan channels the Terminator and succeeds at it. Some are quick to dismiss him as just an emo kid but I think his stunts and demeanour managed to get over that and show a sad broken character beneath. Im interested to see what he can do with the character in Civil War.. Loki. Tom Hiddleston has a nice range of emotions that he brings to the role from impish screwup to brooding fiend to aloof mastermind and by enlarge they work. Hes not the most intimidating or outright eerie but given the film that he is most villainous in he doesnt have to be and succeeds at exactly what he sets out to do.. Iron Monger. Jeff Bridges makes this role and he makes it well. Iron Monger as a whole isnt very memorable but because hes been built up enough and established as a running presence throughout the movie the stakes feel more personal and the urgency of his fight with Iron Man is made more apparent. Bridges nails the feel of a businessmanvillain with a gigantic toy probably better than most other actors on this list do in their roles and I think its just a shame we didnt see more of him.. Alexander Pierce. Much like Bridges Robert Redfords acting sells this performance a lot more than anything else although its a bit more poignant here since Pierce doesnt have a supersuit. Hes charismatic and amusing yet affably evil and scheming all at the same time which sounds a bit cliche as you say it but Redford manages to throw his own spin on it that truly sells the character for me and makes him a believable person. Much like Bridges Im sorry he was only there once because hed have made a great allyturnedvillain if he was established earlier in the MCU canon.. Ronin. Ronin only works as a villain because  again  of the movie hes in. In any other film Ronin would just be Gerry Generic the Evil Mastermind. But because of the Guardians nicely varied personalities and interactions with him Starlords danceoff namely he gets an ironic camp afforded to him. And Lee Pace does a good job pushing the hamminess of his character to  and making that contrast work so well. As a result hes funny and goofy and someone we know we cant take seriously and we like it.. Red Skull. Im convinced that Hugo Weavings voice can make a four day old puppy sound like a Bond villain now. Much like Loki Red Skull fills the role he sets out to very well a Nazi... well evil genius who is beat by the allAmerican hero and he manages to give us all the tropes we want to see let me explain my evil plan affably evil etc. with a great delivery and his offputting visage is the icing on the cake.. Yellowjacket. I was surprised by how well Cory Booker managed to bring Yellowjacket across as a real threat although to be honest at least  of that is because of the awesome design of his suit. Yellowjacket himself is somewhat forgotten in the fastpaced camp of the film as a whole and as a result isnt as developed as Iron Monger or as tongueincheek which he should have been as Ronin or Red Skull. Still hes very creepy while onscreen and  though you might forget about him pretty quick  hes a good villain while he lasts.. Abomination. Abomination is here almost entirely because of the visuals hes a genuinely freaky looking character both in transformation and out of it. Hes totally unmemorable though TIH was in  and is sort of the black sheep of the MCU now to be fair but Tim Roth gives an unnerving performance during the final fight with Hulk despite that and manages to channel his ham into a passable way.. Whiplash. Despite a decent Russian accent Mickey Rourke doesnt bring a lot to this role. Hes underdeveloped I cant even remember his motivation Stark ran him out of business or something? Its glossed over way too fast uninteresting and doesnt play off Tonys personality anywhere near as much as he should even Loki did a better job in just that one scene in Stark Tower in The Avengers. One of the many weak points of Iron Man .. Malekith. I honestly struggled to remember this guys name hes so boring. Malekith feels like the villain that Ronin was satirizing in GOTG hes wooden boring dull unentertaining cliche and overdone. A no good unpleasant loser of a villain and barely worth mentioning at all. Hes only above Killian who I actively dislike because I think that having no character at all is only slightly less offensive than having a shit character.. Killian. Ugh I hate this guy. Generic cut from the cloth Revenge of the Nerdsesque crap who is a victim of a painfully predictable plot twist when he was out there on the rooftop at the beginning of the movie did anyone doubt that he was going to be a villain?. Much like Whiplash he doesnt play off Iron Mans personality and honestly tries to fight with him for zingers more than anything. His plan is dumb his motivations are cliche and dull his acting is generic and he brings nothing to the role. The absolute worst part of Iron Man  no question.,marvelstudios,cued0on,3,t5_2uii8

5254872,0,t3_3myobh,Before the MCU all of my Marvel comic book knowledge other than previous Spiderman and Xmen films came from the game Marvel Ultimate Alliance. I loved that game and it made me interested in the overall Marvel comic book universe though I never did start reading actual comics. Since the game featured a number of relatively obscure heroes particularly Iron Man and Thor I was quite excited to see Iron Man coming to the big screen. I think when I first saw it I missed the after credits scene. It wasnt until Iron Man  that I understood that Marvel Studios was creating a combined universe for all these movie. At that point my interest pretty much solidified into what it is now.Now ever since Thor Ive been living in constant haze of anticipation for the next Marvel film. edit Im surprised how many peoples interest was started with The Avengers.

They are directing both so Civil War should cause even more complications for banding Avengers together to stop Thanos maybe even splitting the teams up.

A fun comparison that i joke with my Marvel circle of friend is that Mantis for her Vietnamese fans is like an celebrity who you first know for her boobs but stay for her talent in other unrelated field.It just a shame in the sense that the director who from choosing an Korean show that he seem tried to follow the character ancestry to some extend did not deem any Vietnamese actress suitable for the role.

Just because they arent female action figures doesnt mean you cant play with them.  Just like Id be fine if there was only female action figures.Thats just my perspective maybe there are significantly less Black Widow  toys to Hawkeye though.

ALL PHASE  MOVIE DESCRIPTIONS ARE IN THIS SECTIONThe Incredible Hulk Gamma World After years in the SWORD run prison known as the Cube the Leader has decided to finally enact his master plan. Using his fellow gammairradiated allies specifically XRay Leader is able to blackout the prison systems and take control of the Cube. Once in control instead of inhibiting the prisoners powers the Leader uses the excess gamma energy to form a dome of pure gamma energy around the Cube. Meanwhile the Hulk is once again fighting Hulkbuster units following his breakout to fight High Evolutionary. But when all seems lost Vision and Thor arrive to ask the Hulk for help. They then tell him of how the Avengers currently consisting of Captain America Vision Wasp Thor Black Panther and SpiderWoman were called to the gamma dome at the cube whereby they entered it and destroyed the generator. Thats when the team learned that it was all a test by the Leader to ensure the Avengers were within the real domes vicinity. Once within the Avengers were attacked by Abomination Absorbing Man Red Hulk and Radioactive Man for just long enough for Leader to initiate the true gamma dome nearby engulfing the entire city of Las Vegas and the Cube into a stronger gamma dome. During the fight the suits of SpiderWoman Wasp Captain America and Black Panther are punctured exposing them to the harmful gamma rays horribly mutating them. As the other Avengers mutated Thor and Vision were able to escape and went on the hunt for the leading expert on gamma radiation Bruce Banner. Hulk then reverts back and the three journey to his hidden away cabin in the Canadian woods. During this time it is also revealed another Avenger entered the dome in an attempt to stop the Leader SheHulk. However with a fight of four on one SheHulk is bested and brought before the Leader to watch as the dome expands and irradiates more people. Eventually after fighting through the town Thor Vision and Hulk make it to the Leaders tower where they face off against Absorbing Man Abomination Red Hulk Radioactive Man and the irradiated Avengers with SheHulk as a fourth ally. As Vision Thor and SheHulk fight the villains Hulk goes right for the kill and attacks Leaders tower deactivating the dome and defeating the Leader reversing the irradiating of the civilians and the other Avengers.After credits sceneBetty Ross is seen running to her father in prison.Betty Dad!

Ive never seen a cocky person not make jokes whilst showing off its kind of their thing. Should Vision? Yes. Hes a robot thats built by notorious sarcastic asshole Tony Stark who made his own AI a sarcastic asshole. Its so ingrained as part of Starks fibre that even Ultron developed a sarcastic childish side. Visions humour was far more subtle though with the quip at Tony being factual and his born yesterday line actually being rather held back and witty for the situation. It worked.Plus on top of that... its a Marvel Comics movie. If everyone was serious the whole time itd feel... wrong. Like a Nolan film where everything is super serious but thats not what a movie involving men in tights robots and super powers should be.

I wonder if something like that would work for the Defenders shows. Either in the show subreddit or a new subreddit just for this purpose everyone could agree on a set number of episodes to watch each week so that within the little spoilerfree bubble of the subreddit you get a simulated version of the hype and the speculation that televised shows get during their seasons.Daredevil is better than anything Im currently watching but my fondest memories related to television shows have been The Legend of Korra and Steven Universe because each new episode is a bombshell that gets speculated and hyped beforehand and then becomes the sole focus of the community afterwards until news of the next episode starts to roll in. Its an incredible group experience that Defenders fans get completely robbed of but I think it can be replicated on a smaller scale if you can find enough people who A. want that experience or B. dont have the time or energy to binge something.,marvelstudios,cyht0gl,3,t5_2uii8

6210497,0,t1_cyvjv5a,gt The fact that Marvel TV has made  fantastic shows alreadyTwo of those are Netflix shows lets not count them. That leaves  shows one which is pretty good and the other one which has had its ups and downs. Agents of SHIELD was pretty bad in the beginning got some strength and then went downhill again. Season  has been pretty weak focusing too much on predictable relationship stuff and predictable clichd plots. It doesnt give me a whole lot of confidence when theyve decided to give my two least favorite characters their own shows. I find them dreadfully onedimensional and incredibly boring. The show might be good and people may love it. However it doesnt sound like I me personally individually would like it. gt In this case just dont watch the show instead of taking the fun out for people that will enjoy it.Speaking about my concerns takes away your enjoyment of something? Damn didnt realize I had that much power.The thing is I want to have fun with the connected MCU. Id love to follow everything. But when theyre spreading so far and so thin with things I literally dont care about theyre ironically taking something away. Im not alone in this thinking either there are lost of people who love the interconnected MCU. But once a bunch of shows come out that I dont have time for or I just dont enjoy well then I cant be part of that group anymore.And not being part of that group doesnt make me any less of a fan.

Marvel Netflix And a lot of TV honestly dont really make the  episodes work any more just stretching things out and so on.

6255628,0,t1_cz0ngdd,I know its really hard to get across to people who are only casually familiar with the character but there is more to the Punisher than violence.

6331538,0,t1_cz8mqkv,I think its amazing how quickly that people pull out these characters and defend keeping the white status quo. They look at this as unnecessary change but fail so see how it effects others outside themselves. Its like striking down the BlackLivesMatter movement saying but all lives matter. I personally am all for having an AsianAsianAm titular character a Marvel property and challenging tired unoriginal stories but I dont think it will happen because the common population and some reditors above see these stories as some sort of minority affirmative action. Danny Rands ethnic background has very little to do with his character. Making him White allows for superficial and lazy chatacter writing in that it already plays off of peoples latent prejudices and stereotypes. An Asian person cannot have the super power of Chi energy manipulationwhich is his superpower BTW and not kungfu fu? An Asian person cannot live a privileged life in America? An Asian person cannot be an outsider to an Asian foreign community? An Asian person cannot have a relationship with a black person that is groundbreaking and uniting of different cultures? These same questions can be said for the a white character but in the same role but again a rehash of old stories. I applaud you for arguing and making these arguments known.

All of the relevant characters can be introduced in the first movie Peter can get the symbiote suit in Infinity War and the suit can be worn throughout the second movie until the end when he ditches it. One after credits scene of Eddie Brock becoming Venom is all you need from there to set up the third movie. Then the symbiotes can have that entire third movie dedicated to them. Venom can be villain at the start but then they can introduce Carnage at the halfway point forcing SpiderMan and Venom to team up.

They want random members of the public because the majority of the millions who watch these films arent super familiar with the source material outside of the films themselves.

Think about how much impact a second movie would have had where he is banished to earth for the first time because his successes of the first movie went to his head. You would understand why his friends are loyal enough to him to invade another world against their Kings wishes as well as Thors own confidence It worked last time right?. And FINALLY the love story between him and Iforgothername would have at least some impact because up to that point two or three years after the first movie people would have Sif and him as their OTP.

I think Agent Carter touched upon them but that seems to be all so far.Department H from Canada would be fun to delve into. As a branch of the Canadian govt they were responsible for a number of subgroups like Alpha Flight. They are technically good guys of course but the way they manipulate and control people they are somewhat grey. Not sure about the ties to Fox with them though since they figure into Wolverines background along with a whole host of nonmutant people. Possibly a shared group.On the darker side there is the Maggia which is modeled on the Mafia but involved with a number of superpowered people. It could be interested to show the history of how basic criminal groups have evolved with the times. Normal types of crime is something that oddly the MCU has barely touched.The Serpent Society is another good one. Lots of snake themed villians and a support group.

MM also outsells what Guardians of the Galaxy was pulling in  before their big revival after the movie was announced. But most importantly Marvel has said that Ms. Marvel is their top digital seller outselling SpiderMan  Avengers  etc. Ms. Marvel has been a hugely important series in diversifying their audience pulling in young readers who will be the voluntary brand ambassadors that will make a Ms. Marvel film a huge hit.gt If thats doubled in digital sales then thats more than enough to keep the title going but Im not sure its land her her own movie zoneIts more than double digital copies of Ms. Marvel actually outsell the print copies Obviously we dont know by how much since Marvel doesnt release digital figures. But its entirely possible that MM might be clearing k per month which would put it among the top  comics.Sales figures alone dont guarantee Kamala in the movies but honestly those numbers would be enough.

6496958,0,t1_czracg3,The biggest threats are often the greatest tools. It all comes down to manipulation. To paraphrase Agents of SHIELD SHIELD was a pawn of HYDRA for decades. Yeah they did do some good but a lot of time what looked like good was really pushing the goals of HYDRA forward in some manner. Natasha even states this when she says she traded in the KGB for HYDRA. She is definitely a major threat to them but if they could manipulate her much like the Patriots in the Metal Gear Solid series manipulated Solid Snake she is a great potential weapon. That explains why she wasnt crossed off earlier.Though we havent seen as much about Fury as we have Black Widow based on what we do know and pulling from the source material comic books we can speculate that Fury was a much bigger threat. Fury isnt really one who its easy at all to manipulate. Fury thinks ahead and plans ahead. As Stark says he is THE spy. Pierce knew all of this about him and knew that once Fury learned that someone was playing him behind the scenes then Fury would be unstoppable. Hes not perfect but he had the means smarts and skills to be a legitimate and immediate threat to HYDRA. That is why it was immediate in the decision to take out Fury.The reason that they would allow I assume for Black Widow to go after WS is because they were playing both the legitimate and illegitimate angles. HYDRA had SHIELD in their pocket but had the KGB Leviathan etc. as well. SO they had the advantage and could clean things up on both ends. Thus it kept BW off the trail of WS beyond a few things here and there. Plus IF for some reason she had wound up figuring things out andor killed WS I have a feeling that they HYDRA would have captured her and used her as a replacement for him ... through the brainwashing techniques they used. And I agree that the second alternative is the more plausible one of the two.,marvelstudios,czrc0r7,0,t5_2uii8

The Punisher has accumulated vast information and has had visual confirmation of the criminals activities for a long time and had been ignored by Daredevil. The petty criminal turns out not to be so petty and ends up killing several innocents later on. Its actually BULLSEYE! Punisher and Daredevil duke it out HARD again but come to terms to teamup to solve the problem. During this conflict theyre verbally ripping on each others methodologies and world views.  The two are able to handle the situation well saving a number of innocents. Matt turns to congratulate Frank in the handling of the situation possibly with a new scope on how they could work together only to see Frank in the act of murdering several criminals. Matt shoots Frank whereas in their first encounter he could not. Justice is served...blah blah blah. Punisher ends up in solitary isolation sharing walls with DUN DUN DUN...KINGPIN.  The season leaves both Punisher and Daredevil with pondering questions of operation. For the Punisher what if I was wrong? For Daredevil can I really end things without casualty?

6544693,0,t1_czw2e25,I just think it would have been a better movie if the mind stone didnt do everything for the characters. IMO having the mind stone create Ultron took away some of Ultrons core characteristics and motivation. To me Ultron never really felt like he was a direct product of Tony but rather just popped into existence from the Infinity Gem and was kind of crazy. I have always thought of Ultron as a Frankensteins Monster kind of character and not really sharing a true connection with his creator takes away a lot of possibilities for what could have been. Also I am not a huge fan of the Vision being created by not only the Mind Stone but also mainly by the Avengers. Tony and team spent more time creating The Vision than spent successfully creating Ultron. I always thought The Vision was a bad guy turned good character who was created by Ultron to destroy the Avengers. Which would have been cool to see. Also tying him to an Infinity gem is going to require a lot of explanation once Thanos comes and takes it off his face. The mind gem just felt like a shoehorned plot point because they had to. IMO without it or with it taking the back seat everything would have felt more personal and less because space rock. ,marvelstudios,czw9vz8,1,t5_2uii8

You dont lose the oddcouple racial dynamics or Heroes for Hire or his relationship with Misty Knight. And being an Asian American in a mystical kingdom and being an outsider just seemed like a richer heros journey to me.Its like with Miles Morales. Weve had  years and  movies with Peter Parker.

6767973,0,t3_48gn8f,personally I would love for marvel to take all of its tv shows to netfilx. that doesnt mean that AOS or agent carter would lose their personalities and become automatically gritty like daredevil or jessica jones but it would  be cool for people to have access to all marvel projects in the same place. specially for international audiences who have to wait months for local networks to pick the ABC shows.  I like AOS but I think it has a lot of filler like all  episode season tv shows do and that makes a lot of people lose interest quickly.  people are starting to like short and more focused seasons on their tv shows now.  something they can see whenever they want and however they want not a  month week after week commitment where you have to be in front of your tv every Tuesday night to help with ratings or the show is gonna get cancelled.also marvel should start working with netflix in some MCU animated series like dreamworks is doing.I dont see a marvel tv show having more than . or . ratings at ABC unless they change the name to agents of s.h.o.n.d.r.a. cause ABC is not the kind of network people go to for scifi or action series. ,marvelstudios,d0jfhjd,2,t5_2uii8

Thus the live Nielson ratings numbers are not truly accurate to how popular a show or film is. Because of that networks need to find a way to increase their profits without the need for ad revenue. If they cant figure that out then eventually they will start to lose money and if that goes on for long they could fold.

Sony and MarvelDisneyFeige are at odds. We already know theres issues involving the actual marketing of SpiderMan and the rights to market SpiderMan hence why Spidey hasnt appeared in any Civil War Marketing. Sony are prepping this film as a We dont need you. We can do this on our own. So play ball with us.  Sony still thinks its still the s and Venom is the most popular villain in comics and thus can carry his own franchise. Hint Its not the s anymore.  Sony is doing this just to keep Avi Arad quiet. We know Arad and Feige dont get on.  Sony saw how well Deadpool did and want their own RRated Superhero film. Disney however dont want an RRated MCU film so Sony is doing it in its own continuity.The ultimate conclusion though Sony are fucking idiots when it comes to movies. The higher ups at Sony need to seriously consider having a huge shakeup in management when it comes to their movie department because whoever is in charge now have no idea what they are doing. ,marvelstudios,d0o3tjf,13,t5_2uii8

6812261,0,t3_4907n1,This one also feels like its really going to be the culmination of something. The arc weve seen for Cap from earnest and eager face of the army in Cap all the way to a fugitive from the government in Cap will come full circle. Likewise well see the culmination of Iron Mans arc from Ive successfully privatized world peace to If we dont accept limitations were no better than the bad guys.Plus everything in Phase  is getting far away from the Earth Avengers after this until Infinity War which means that the ending to this movie can be pretty final. After this we have Doctor Strange completely unrelated and set to explore other spaces and dimensions SpiderMan confirmed by Russos to have a smaller role in Civil War and to not be very emotionally connected to the plot GotG vol.  confirmed not to have anything to do with the Avengers Thor Ragnarok not likely to spend much time on Earth and Black Panther potentially the one with the closest ties but still following the story of a reclusive king in a foreign country.Opening Phase  with this movie is going to be an absolute gut punch. The Russos say this sets the scene for where well be in the MCU leading up to Infinity War. Considering where we are is pretty far away from pretty much all of the Avengers its safe to say that the team is going to be all but shattered by the end fingers crossed for a fatality or two.

Nano technology isnt a sufficent explination since the watch would still have to store the entire mass. This has astounding implications for the MCU since he now has the ability to create anything from raw power and considering the amount of energy it would take in addition to the small scale of his glove he would have also had to create a power source that is significantly stronger than his already impossible arc reactor.To put it bluntly if he has this technology and is still running around playing super hero then he is a very stupid genius who doesnt know how to apply his own technology efficiently.Dont get me wrong I am SO HYPE for this movie but when I saw that it made me cringe a bit.,marvelstudios,d11451f,-8,t5_2uii8

6950569,0,t1_d146fx3,Part Bearing in mind characters you need to include and stories that are told how much of where the franchise goes next is down to you as creatives and how much is steered by Disney and Marvel?JR Maybe theres a character requirement but with things like Avengers Infinity War thats obvious because its a culmination of all the films in the phase that have preceded it. You know that Thanos is going to be in there and the majority of the Marvel Universe is going to appear in the movies. Those are givens but after that we can construct any narrative we want around it and what we think is the best execution of the story.So you have mentioned characters that we know are going to be in Avengers Infinity War but are there going to be characters that we dont already know are going to be in there?AR There are certain characters that you dont know.New characters?JR New characters that are going to appear in Avengers Infinity War. Its a big sprawling ambitious movie its about as ambitious as movies get and it should be and the title alone indicates that there will be an incredible scape and scope to it.AR It is intended to be the entire culmination of the Marvel cinematic universe and in many ways the end to that part of it. But we dont even have the first draft in on that script yet were still in the outline phase. Its hard not to talk about it too specifically now only because of spoilers but also because were still figuring it out.So you guys dont even know?AR We have an idea but lets see if that evolves over the next couple of months.SpiderMan made an appearance at the end of the most recent Captain America Civil War trailer. Did you always intend to put him in there or did you feel your hand forced by fans?JR We always intended to. He was my favorite character growing up I still have my collection of comics in my closet so it was a dream come true for us to be able to have Spidey in the movie and interpret him as a character so we couldnt be more excited and we wanted to share that with everybody else.AR Also I think it was a little bit of a correction because it was a very complicated deal that Sony had to work out with Marvel Studios and Disney in order to make that work. We were very quiet about SpiderMans involvement in the movie for much longer than we would have been. We were artificially silent on the character because it was such a sensitive business deal still being worked out even while we were shooting. We went through a very thorough casting process we tested Tom Holland vigorously with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr we screen tested him along with several other actors it was a very intense part of making Captain America Civil War because he was an important part of the movie to us. Finally its all secure and were at a place where we can present him even in just a small taste.JR We thought it was a great way to reveal him.

The problem with why its being brought up isnt because age of Ultron was bad but the fact with BvS they went the same route of marketing rather than attempting to make a good movie when they didnt have to so its more a criticism of the studio repeating what Marvel did when DC really shouldnt had to at all. People are blaming Marvel for setting the standard for superhero movies but its more the transformers method where they use a popular IP to market something else instead of the integrity of good story telling. While not the case with AoU we cant deny it was cut due to marketing out of fear it was too long and butcher it. BvS  however would be better off removing some content but were kept as Easter eggs.

7071711,0,t1_d1hpw8l,I remember hearing a theory from Film Crit HULK about tangible details. Essentially when theres something wrong with a film people look to something tangible to explain it. If your car isnt working right youre going to blame it on that funny sound it makes rather than the underlying issue. You could fix the sound but your car may still be broken.Its why people blame the dancing scene for whats wrong in SpiderMan  JarJar Binks for why Episode  doesnt work and Bat nipples for the Schumacher movies. Take those out and those movies still have problems but people dont know how to voice those concerns.Slightly related this is the reason why I think people are so adamant about defending Amazing SpiderMan as an okay film. Theres nothing about it that screams This doesnt work so people think it has to be okay when it has serious underlying issuesIn the same way people blame any problems in Age of Ultron on the humor as if that was somehow responsible.For the record I really liked Age of Ultron.

Perhaps they think there wouldve been no alien invasion if the Avengers didnt exist  regardless of whether or not the WSC was going to nuke Manhattan Island. We of course know thats bogus but thats how political agendas work.Also heres something I was thinking about today General Ross only mentions the events of The Avengers The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron but Ive got a feeling hell mention the events of The Dark World and his own movie The Incredible Hulk as well.

Our real world is a melting pot itself where glass buildings glamour white collar deals exist in the same world as neighbourhoods where humanity goes to die literally and figuriatively acts of horror and disgusting crime exists in the same world maybe even the same city as the greatest luxery and kindness. Its all about the perspective and what lens you put on to view this world with you do that by switching between shows and mediums.I totally agree though that they need to acknowledge the world alot more to make that juxtoposition and statement alot more powerful. They Daredevil specifically Jessica Jones seems to be pulling its weight place this story in a world we and the characters already know yet they never talk about it. There is no contrast to be made and greater explorations in worldbuilding is wasted if there is no starting point that visually and verbally is alluded to. Their mission statement of The Darker and Grittier side of the MCU just gets lost by the fact they dont seem to want to set it in the MCU at all.

Quick nods like the Captain America Shield in Iron Man  references to other characters and the big cliffhanger postcredits scenes speak more to comic fans but it never is made central to the film. Marvel MCU movies are always made to work individually with the exception of Avengers  which borderlined on too much exposition without explanation Batman v Superman seemed to forget its central narrative way too often in an attempt to shift the Justice League onto the viewer even though the general viewer likely has no clue what a motherbox is. what the fucks a motherbox? what are boom tubes?

Its like Heat combined with a bit of Mission Impossible just throwing a batsuit on Ethan Hunt as he jumps from planes onto buildings.That approach worked but it doesnt allow for the massive spectacle movies with overthetop superpowers that the rest of the DC universe is built around.,marvelstudios,d1wn4yn,11,t5_2uii8

7222875,0,t3_4edkld,I think that you might be jumping to the wrong conclusion. What weaknesses there were in the second half compared to the first half may have nothing to do with the showrunners being a team. I would chalk some of it up to the learning experience of writers getting their first chance to run a show. Getting the feel of a show right is a huge challenge and they did a great job. Sticking the landing is a weakness of many superhero stories on film and TV.  Some of it might be in the source material. I know I was already bored of armies of ninjas. Sure seeing Castle mow them all down with a minigun would have been cathartic but it wouldnt make the ninjas more interesting. I get why Marvel chose the source since it goes handinhand with Elektra but the sooner we can move on from ninja armies the better.This pair deserves to do the next season. If one of them is unavailable Im all for the other getting a chance to work solo or find another partner whichever they are most comfortable with.,marvelstudios,d1z6q3f,3,t5_2uii8
7223741,0,t1_d1z62qq,Dude you didnt make a valid case for your idea. Pointing out its flaws wasnt fun I just felt bad because nobody wants to hear their story ideas are trash. I asked you to not take it personally but here you are taking it personally. I challenged you to better yourself. Im not a writer but Ive taken some writing classes for fun. And my professor always said that your first ideas are usually the worst. Because youre looking for the easiest.But hey if youre open Ill tell you some ideas Ive tossed around.. Higher budget movie would be about the skrull invasion. Probably not a massive one where droves of people are taken but select members are kidnapped and replaced. This is perfect for Black Widow for a number of reasons. First is the thematic role reversal of her character. The person whos the hardest to trust now cannot trust anyone. Secondly this could easily lead to her past. Now shed only try to contact people that the Avengers never knew about before she went straight or before she became a weapon. We get some of her background without diving too deep as to remove all mystery. And third is probably the most important the genre of spy games and espionage. The movie needs to show why Black Widow has a place in The Avengers since most people see her as just a human with guns. So her ability to manipulate situations sneak through bases and plan out her attacks would be greatly utilized.. Something with a midlevel budget would be more of a standalone mission with costar Winter Soldier. Just as Widow played copilot in Cap  Bucky plays the same role in her movie. And this makes sense considering their shared Russian past. Perhaps Widow needs help taking down a criminal organization shes been researching which would explain her motivations of why shes a hero. Remember we havent gotten a whole lot of her characters motivation so that should be highlighted. Iron Man saw what his weapons did and wants to prevent that. Steve was raised by good parents with a good heart. Hawkeye is a family man. And so on but we dont have much for Widow. Hell maybe a new Black Widow program is starting up in Russia and she has to find it to put a stop to it. Perfect opportunity to know more about her abilities and maybe toss in a moment with Agent Carter.. Lower budget around m as I said would just be a standalone spy thriller. This would be less about Widow as a character and more about what she can do and how she does it. Think James Bond but with a woman. The story would be a little more adult maybe dealing with human trafficking or drugs. I can imagine a scene where Black Widow explains that the Avengers need to put on a smiling and clean face for the public because knowing the real evils of the world would horrify them. This would of course be combined with preCraig Bond gadgets since after speaking to a few younger people on this they see Black Widow as a Batman type of hero.Try to not ask yourself What do I want to see?Ask yourself What would make a good story?,marvelstudios,d1zaa2j,5,t5_2uii8

Youre hung up on the fact that basically the person who teaches Strange lives in the East but the actual elements of Doctor Strange have nothing to do Asian culture. Multiverses portals demons time travel these things are not Asian culture. Stranges costume is not Asian. For every Asian themed relic or item he has he has also a medival European or Norse themed relic. He learns his magic in Asia but the magic he learns isnt Asian magic. Hes a New Yorker dressed like a Merlin style wizard who practices general magic. Him getting taught non Asian magic in Asia does not make this a movie that borrows heavily from Asian culture. Also having lived in Asia the idea of Asian culture is confusing and mostly bullshit anyway. There is no Asian culture. Japanese culture and Mongolian culture have no overlap. Do you think a Chinese person would be satisfied by the presence of a Japanese actor in a movie that borrows Chinese culture?

7288279,1,t1_d26hsz1,Personally?Id do Morgan le Fey in Phase . Make her big enough to be an Avengers level threat but different enough magic villain for starters that she wont just be a pushover compared to Thanos. The idea being to take us from Infinity War level threats back to The Avengers level threats in a believable way.Phase  Dark Reign Dark Avengers build up to a big team vs team fight.Phase ? Ultron. Bring him back nastier and more menacing than before. Twoparter so Phases  have a similar overall structure to Phases . Ultron takes over the world and kills people and does his shit in Avengers  Part  and when Avengers  Part  starts hes been running the world for a while and the remaining heroes and villains! quite nice we just did Dark Reign to set this up are working together to try and stop him. Time travel alternate world thats just as bad because Morgan le Fey is in charge straight up do an adaptation of the comic Age of Ultron storyline in a big and epic way. Or do something new. But I think bringing Ultron back in a big way could make up for some of the complaints people had with him in his first film as well as the general every villain except Loki dies when their movie is over complaint and has a lot of potential to be awesome.By then I figure wed have enough rights reverted or companies willing to play nice with DisneyMarvel that we could start a DoomGalactus arc for .,marvelstudios,d26mmrw,2,t5_2uii8
7290515,0,t3_4f8usd,I think Warner deserves all the flack it gets but not DC. DC is iconic mythic and and has consistency in their editorial department that makes me as a Marvel fan jealous. Theyve made some of the best comics in the world and they continue to do great things in their animation department as well turning out a truly impressive level of connectivity in their tv universe. Both of which are things marvel still struggles with. Its just hard to get on board with a company like WB that seems to be more interested in franchise building than story telling. Dont get me wrong Marvel has their own bean counters but the difference is that the people ultimately calling the shots are lifelong fans. DC deserves better than Warner. ,marvelstudios,d26vs0h,72,t5_2uii8

Im not holding back.At first I was underwhelmed by Panther the chase scene didnt seem that special but when he threw down Bucky in the canteen fight without his suit I was convinced of his badassery.Wanda  Vision fuck yeah. Also sad as fuck when they fought. I loved how Vision started comforting her once Cap and Bucky left.Edit Also fucking confirmed Wanda  OP. She actually influenced the Mind Stone in Visions head. Let me repeat that to get it to sink in.Wanda can manipulate the Mind Stone to do whatever she wants it to do.Sharon  Steve fuck yeah. Sad to see Peggy go though. I hope they flesh her out some more on TV I am in love with her.Falcon basically did everything Cap did just slower. I loved his figthing style in the first scenes how he used his wings as shields.Zemo scared the shit out of me. I was AFRAID. Hes great. His motivations are surprisingly chaotic. I loved his story and I expect him to return in Black Panther maybe? I think Black Panther might feature some Bucky and Zemo. Otherwise theyre gonna keep him for Masters of Evil.Clint was great. He still cares very much for Wanda. His anger at Tony for locking him up seemed very justified.Natasha was kind of underwhelming. Her role seemed more diplomatic than spyherofighter. I wouldnt call her a double agent because she still believes in the Accords.Vision was great. He was very Visionlike throughout the movie and it was funny to see him trying to relate to human emotions when he actually cant. He kind of just disappeared in the airport fight for a bit though.Rhodey  Hes not dead but hes paralyzed and crippled. Hell probably never walk again without those braces. Its funny how he seemed to believe more in the Accords than Tony. He got hit by Vision who was aiming for Falcon but Falcon dodged it and Vision was distracted by his Roboboner for Wanda.Theres a lot of characters and all of them get a lot of meaningful development yet the movie still is a real Captain America movie. Good job Russos.Giving Sharon the You move speech was awesome.I was told there would be Pepper Potts. I was left disappointed. Tony has been disappointed more. They broke up.SpiderMan was ... SpiderMan. His humor was exactly on point his suit looked awesome his behavior was exactly what I expected of SpiderMan but ... The action was kind of disappointing. I didnt notice anything that we hadnt seen before in his fighting style except for the ATAT attack. It was nice to see him team up with other heroes though it was amazing to see Spidey on screen at the same time as all the others.I actually prefer the Peter Parker scenes though. Aunt May is hot. Tony thinks so too. He kind of rubs it in with Peter though.AntMan was great but underused. I wanted some more Paul Rudd humor but we only got the recruiting scene and the becoming GiantManbit that satisfied me.The multiple WinterSoldier plot scared me. Im kind of glad Zemo killed them all first because I dont think they couldve taken them not even BuckyCapPantherTony.Tony doesnt qever say You just started a war! like in the trailer. Disappointed by that a bit.The RossStark rivalry is continued.The final fight between Tony and CapBucky was fucking brutal. It wasnt the best fight scene in the MCU it wasnt the most elegant fight scene but fuck ... It really felt like they were going to kill each other.I actually wouldve preferred to see one kill the other. The ending broke my heart healed it broke it again stomped on it pissed on it spit on it and then threw it in the trash. Rip Avengers. Kind of glad that Cap gave Tony that phone. The split also opens Tony up to appear in Homecoming.Stan Lees cameo was dank stank.The Wakanda midcredit scene took away my breath. Wakanda looks amazing. TChalla taking in Bucky showed how righteous he is. He wants to amend for wrongfully blaming him. I also loved his scene with Zemo. Showed how this movie already had a complete character arc for someone who was just introduced as secondary character.Spidey postcredit scene was kind of meh. It didnt really Hype me up anymore for the movie than I already was.If I were to write down the plot to the movie right here youd think it was a clusterfuck but the movie ties it together so well. Its not confusing at all.I was disappointed by the score. I heard no throwback to Silvestris score which makes sense with Steve severing ties to the past. However there was nothing as memorable as the Silvestri Cap theme or as epic as TWS score. It was a lot more moderate. I did like the Winter Soldier theme from TWS return many times.Im gonna be editing this whenever I think of something.Edit I went to see it in a Captain America marathon the three Cap movies. Being confronted by both Civil War and The Winter Soldier I am afraid I have to say that Civil War wasnt able to dethrone The Winter Soldier as my favorite MCU movie. Civil War is  definitely  but TWS still is .I dont know how many people know this but Joe Russo had a cameo in TWS. He was the doctor who took care of Fury. He also cameos in this movie as the guy Zemo killed to get close to Bucky.,marvelstudios,d2j4yiw,19,t5_2uii8

Stark developed it after taking a modified dose of the Extremis virus this armor properly linked his armor to his body due to the virus.  Bleeding Edge This one is a bit more outlandish. Basically the suit is composed of nanomachines stored inside Tonys bones so he can suit up on command. Instead of motors the suit is composed of nanomachines that basically serve as a second layer of muscle. Model  after having a hard time on Earth Tony decided to chill out a bit in space with the Guardians of The Galaxy. He built this armor to sustain itself in space.

7452346,0,t3_4he5rn,I dont think weve seen an extremely intelligent Peter portrayed accurately in the films ever. Tobey was just insanely gifted at costume designing but his webs were organic and he otherwise survived due to supersenses or dumb luck. And he does act dumb otherwise.Garfields Peter was intelligent enough to build the webshooters...except he stole the designs from OsCorp. And he was dumb enough to fuck around with the weird spider device in that blue room. And the movies constantly undercut his intelligence by making Gwen way smarter than him. Did he even apply or get accepted into a college? He also broke the promise he made to Gwens dad making him directly responsible for her later death and also IGNORES Uncle Bens responsibility speech he sortofkindof gave in TASM.Hollands Peter is just right. Hes not an uber geek with crusty gel hair huge glasses and a sweatervest like the s but hes also not a skateboarding hipster who listens to Coldplay in his downtime. Hes a geek whos also extremely interested in science and intelligent enough to build a webbing device to swing around with. However hes not an amazing costume designer and so his original outfit sucks. He understands the importance of keeping his identity secret and is trying to do the right thing because he has the means to do it moreso than any other normal person.He also doesnt fuck around with his powers out in public like Garfield did nearly exposing himself multiple times. While Garfield displayed his inexplicable extraordinary abilities to show off on the basketball court or tossing a football so hard it bends the goal at the end of the field. Meanwhile Holland makes it known straight away that Peter is aware that his powers make him incredibly gifted and thats exactly why he has to be careful and keep them secret.With just one five minute scene with Tony Stark we learned everything we needed to know about Peters motives his intelligence physical skills and experience. And later on hes even cracking jokes that are far superior to Maguires ONE joke in the first film and Garfields lameass jokes in the reboot. And I didnt even think he was that funny in the movie and hes still miles ahead of the previous actors. ,marvelstudios,d2pa9f6,4,t5_2uii8

7453731,0,t3_4hemql,Basically it is the most powerful humanmade weapon on Earth in the MCU. It can kill anything that could die from physical forces. Only way to survive is if you wear a Pym Particle suit resists it or if you have near godly regeneration or immunity to physical harm Comic Hulk does but probably not MCU Hulk. Comic Thanos can probably resist its effects but we dont know how strong is MCU Thanos.Really its like using a Star Trek teleporter as a weapon. I remember in Star Gate SG did use teleporters as a weapon by teleporting nukes and so that horrified the aliens who originally invented the technology that they banned it.

So I have a problem with the you guys section of the comments because I think there is no reason at all to have an usthem relationship with DC I like both Spiderman and Batman equally. And I have a problem with deserve. A movie should always strive to be good but when it is it isnt deserved by the fans. Its because the creators did something good.

But in the momentright after learning that his parents  were murdered  by having their faces violently smashed in  by this guy standing right in front of himhis reaction was a completely understandable kneejerk emotional one.

7531989,0,t3_4ifyxl,I know shes overlooked especially in a movie with the Best Cinematic SpiderMan and where Black Panther makes his first movie debut but Scarlet Witch I think was my favorite character in this movie.Her character arc in Age of Ultron was brilliant IMO and I can still see the burden and development she holds from the flim. It gets modified tenfold by having her have to deal with Crossbones suicide bombing.Scarlet Witch and Vision instantly caught my attention in this movie and I think their bond is already immensely strong since theyre both linked with an Infinity Gem both of them are afraid of how much power they have and what they can do if put in the wrong hands. Thats makes them inseparable and surprisingly relatable since they are the only ones who truly understand one another.Despite her being the most powerful Avenger up til this point Wanda is the most grounded character in my honest opinion.

7549602,0,t1_d304kem,Every comics property Marvel had with an element of name recognition was bought up as soon as Marvel started selling Spiderman the Xmen the Fantastic Four The Hulk Punisher. All the Alist franchises were already sold and even some Blist like Ghost Rider and Daredevil.The only things that Marvel had which could be considered well known were the Hulk newly returned after Universals attempt and The Avengers which were really only known as Marvels Justice League. At the time the thought of most of the execs was that youd have to bank on whatever name recognition you could get from The Avengers to make that movie then you could spin off the heroes into their own stories.The only way it could work the other way round is if either Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk was tremendously successful.

They wrote Steve and Peggy as being central to each others lives and arcs in both the Cap films and Agent Carter so dismissing her as a woman Cap once kissed was like really guys? Although honestly after the punishing Bucky thing the other day Im starting to wonder if theyre just really bad at expressing themselves verbally as opposed to in writing because neither Peggy as some girl he once kissed nor Bucky as someone who needs to be punished is an interpretation thats even remotely supported by the actual films that THEY wrote so I honestly cant think of any other explanation for such bizarre and outoftouch statements.

Buckys death was also not his fault he did the best he could. When I said Cap was usually right I was speaking in terms of morality and trusting his intuition. Its impossible to always prevent casualties in the heat of battle. He wanted the serum to fight and to help people. The war and the future would have turned out much worst without him. He knew the accords were coming he just didnt agree with them. He was even considering signing it until Tony mentioned Wanda. The only time I can remember him letting Bucky go was at the end. Imperfect and irresponsible but Cap had completed his mission and was emotionally exhausted. The cruelest thing Cap has done is withhold that info from Tony.

7600172,0,t1_d3634ip,I just love how the action was shot and displayed in that movie. There wasnt any shakycam and when Cap fights Balroc at the beginning of the movie many of the shots are wide and long so that we can see the entire body of both actors. It was kinda like a fighting game but in the best way possible. I was a bit disappointed with the first act of CW in that they used a lot of shaky cam a camera guy with a camera running around the actors to film the action. I do not like that cinematic style. Plus that car chase scene with Nick Fury was just the greatest. Except for the escape into the sewer through  feet of earth in  seconds thing.

If it hadnt youd be complaining that Snyder had butchered it because he cut this or that motif but since most of its there you have to complain that he kept it there like its a personal insult that he liked the style of the book enough to translate it to the screen rather than just give us a synopsis of Watchmen on screen.,marvelstudios,d367r43,6,t5_2uii8

Can we be sure this was the guy that just said I know it wasnt my fault but I did it?At the start of the fight Bucky is  focused on escaping.  Its only after Tony closes off the escape route and starts wailing on Steve that Bucky truly goes after him.  Which is completely in character to me.  Even if Bucky were willing to give himself up theres absolutely no way hed allow Steve to get killed in the process.

The teleportation that happens during the climax of the movie had nothing to do with the Aether and was a result of the Convergence. Thor himself mentions it like twice in the movie.

I just find it hard to believe that Marvel is going to go very far down that road. To date they just have not connected things on that sort of level.

Sure they can keep certain shows on that are easy contracts to keep but the original content from Netflix has been phenominal. Outside of Marvel which all three seasons have been exceptional Netflix has great shows like House of Cards Orange is the New Black Narcos Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Marco Polo Bloodline and Master of None.

He just lost Peggy and all hes got left is this metal armed dude who at least wears the face of his only remaining friend from the early th Century. Nats done what she can  I didnt want you to be alone  but at some level Cap just still feels terribly terribly alone and saving Bucky became akin to saving himself no matter what else it cost.For the record Tony also made a ton of bad decisions in Civil War because of his own problems.

Just figured Id explain my reasoning behind its current format.I know that Netflix is still television but its such a drastically different format that it just really feels necessary to have them listed separately... and not only that the shows themselves are so different both in content and in connectivity. The Netflix shows are the super dark gritty TVMA shows that all make up one miniuniverse the universe of the Defenders whereas the ABC shows are familyfriendly and unrelated to those on Netflix. In addition when I was going through different drafts and pitching them to the community here the majority seemed to like the split between television and Netflix. There were naysayers as there always will be! but the scales seemed to be tipped toward dividing them.As far as dividing up ABC and Freeform Freeform is still a part of ABC so it seems like at that point we would be splitting them into subcategories that were too specific especially since for the time being CampD would be the only one under Freeform.Just thought I would explain myself!,marvelstudios,d3oe6v0,4,t5_2uii8

There are things every character brings to the table that makes them unique and Punisher is no exception.Itd make perfect sense for Nick Fury to seek him out like he does in the comics for some wetwork the Avengers arent willing to do.

So seeing him go up against someone who has martial arts training and is even better than him really differs from the rest of the antagonists he fought in that season and shows that Nobu poses a real threat to Matt. Its a shame the Season  Hand ninjas are more or less cannon fodder.My problem with Season  is Elektra for the most part. I couldnt really root for or get behind her character as a protagonist. The episode where they reveal that shes the Black Sky was the worst because her motivation was incredibly unclear. One minute shes trying to kill Stick the next minute she wants to help the Hand because DESTINY then the next shes back to helping Matt because he talks her back down. Overall its hard for me to relate or sympathize with this version of Elektra. I can understand your problem with the Thor movies. Some more world building with Asgard could not hurt. ,marvelstudios,d3tmrku,1,t5_2uii8

How many villains get reused in franchises? Not counting reboots. Not a lot. The Dark Knight trilogy only had one recurring villain and he played a very minor role in the sequels Ramis Spiderman killed off its villains MoS killed Zod. XMen has kept Magneto but hes only really been the main antagonist in  movies while the other villains have all been killed off. Deadpool killed his villain cause hes Deadpool.

My favorite idea to continue Agent Carter on netflix would be to play off the oh so popular flashback story telling mechanic.Show Peggy Jarvis and Howard investigating Thompsons death in the past while Sharon Emily Van Camp continues to solved the mystery in the present day.Give us some parallels between Sharon and Peggy. Show us that all of Peggys progress has mad a difference for women today like Sharon. It would give her story so much meaning! We know SHIELD values women for all sorts of roles Science Simmons Combat May Espionage Bobbi. Show us through a shared story how Peggy helped make this happen. ,marvelstudios,d3utwp5,3,t5_2uii8

I doubt it would be the story for the first one but I could see it featuring in a second film or possibly a third. It is the plot of a solo WS filmI think we will see him maybe one more time in this Phase. Then hell probably feature in a few films in Phase .Note Also Marvel DOES NOT have to put an actor in the number of films their contract states. The contract is worded in such a way that if they WANT they can put him in  films but the number itself that they decide to use him in is decided by Marvel not by a legality that makes them have to be the number stated.,marvelstudios,d49p2el,8,t5_2uii8

7966728,0,t1_d4b0v2r,I agree with you. Though Im not sure itd work. Theyd always be compared to other games.. and wouldnt innovate enough. Like the Arkham styled Captain America game we already got. Batman is definitely more interesting to play as a openworld character. The way Captain America works is more like.. a leader of a team.. and he fights. He dont fly he doesnt have gadgets.. Im not sure it would be THAT exciting.I understand that Marvel is cautious about this because making a game with their characters could be risky. A Tomb Raideresque game where a hero is stripped of his power and has to build himself back could be great. It could maybe fit Iron Man.. building gadgets and his suit back from parts and eventually becoming Iron Man in the middle of the game.. and then improving until the final battle.In the end its complicated risky.. and stuff.,marvelstudios,d4bjas6,1,t5_2uii8

Stuff needs to happen to counter balance the past. And if companies only made financially beneficial decisions then the climate of what is profitable would stagnate. Marvel is a big enough name to change the status quo of the box office and changing the inherent sexism and racism of Hollywood would catch on elsewhere if this huge franchise lead the way. If they were only concerned with what made money wed be on iron man  with no other films. Quality is a concern here.

They could make an easy profit out of this and it would allow for some very affordable cameos in future films where the couple from the above romcom are ordering food at the diner that Captain America and crew are discussing events.,marvelstudios,d4tqlnr,4,t5_2uii8

As a result he would add in to casual conversation with the museums patrons that Bucky was indeed innocent.

8185891,0,t1_d50d7qf,I dont agree with all your points but I think you nailed Joss Whedons intention when writing these characters. I want to reiterate that I do mean intention because after listening to podcasts and interviews with him Im absolutely convinced that he was attempting to write the idealized characters as a rebellion against the Russo brothers and the deconstruction he despises in modern comics and comicbook films.Joss Whedon hates comicbook antiheroes grey morality and the trend towards darker more cynical comicbook characters. The Russo Bros are on the opposite end of the spectrum citing Wolverine and Punisher as some of their favorite characters growing up. Which is why theyre actively shifting the MCU into thoughtful deconstruction. Im not just applying that term casually Joe Russo specifically said that in Winter Soldier and Civil War they were tackling the pillars of the MCU SHIELD and The Avengers and attempting to deconstruct the films to keep the MCU honest and interesting. Theyre not afraid to muddy Caps character a bit because they know giving him flaws is the only way for a character like his to grow.I grew up with Joss Whedons TV shows and hes a very talented writer but his personal perspective on what it means to be a superhero was honestly hamstringing the growth of the MCU and Im thrilled that the Russos were there to pick up the slack because as far as Im concerned this is where MCU needs to go.,marvelstudios,d50scka,4,t5_2uii8

8195206,0,t3_4rkofw,Latino Review tends to be wrong actually. They get lucky every once in a while but if you throw out enough potential theories you are eventually gonna get one or two right.For me I dont want Ghost Rider unless the demon and hell aspect of it are shown to be extradimensional in nature in the vein of Doctor Strange type of stuff. Since Asgardians are not gods in the MCU but are aliens I would rather they skip the full on deity thing altogether. Also I really dont want Blade unless vampires and Blades powers are tied to the Darkforce. If you read up on the Darkforce many of the classical attributes of vampires can be produced by using this energy source. And I think that having minicamps within the MCU would be sort of cool like the Super Soldier camp ... Winter Soldier Captain America Hulk etc. the Gamma camp ... Hulk Leader Abomination etc. the Russian camp ... Winter Soldier Black Widows Leviathan etc. the mystical camp ... Doctor Strange Blade Ghost Rider etc. and so on and so forth. ,marvelstudios,d51yb81,9,t5_2uii8

But they had to be cut to keep the movies flow together.Another example is the scenes with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch particularly right before they meet Ultron for the first time.

8246434,0,t3_4s40en,Personally I think the Captain America films function as intended. The coherence through them is not a singular story broken up across  movies like a Star Wars or with a single character and setting visiting  different themes like The Dark Knight trilogy. If you look at his arc over the course of the  films there is a very strong theme that runs through them all which is Capss loyalty. And it is explored through his relationship with the government and Bucky.He is basically mistreated and deceived by the government in all  movies and his relationships and loyalty to the people around him is the through line culminating in him finally having to make a tough decision regarding who his loyalties ultimately lie with. These are NOT themes in the Avengers movies.To me the closest trilogy in structure to Captain America I can think of is the Bourne trilogy. The themes and story continually expand in scope and deepen in meaning but stay relatively consistent. Just as Captain Americas.But to your point its also important to note that the movies are not called Captain America  Captain America  and Captain America  the way the Iron Man films are titlednumbered. The fact that Caps films are all subtitled is a clear indication that this is a different kind of trilogy. The Iron Man movies are much more character pieces exploring who Tony Stark is. Who Steve is never really changes.,marvelstudios,d58cyr6,1,t5_2uii8

The way the Super Soldier serum was responsible for both Cap and the Hulk that way you didnt need two amazing formulas just the one.  Or that the twins were the result of the gems instead of mutants or that Vision and Ultron were pretty much the result of the same AI so you didnt need to two genius inventions just one.

Both Tony and the Black Widow explain to the others that this is coming whether they want to or not and its best to at least have a hand on the wheel.In Iron Man  Tony is brought before a senate committee who demand he hand over the Iron Man technology and he publicly tells them to go f themselves.  If you believe Tony Stark went along with Ross because he felt that he was forced to toe the line and not out of a selfish desire to alleviate his own guilt then I think youre mistaken.gt  He plants himself like a tree and tells the world to fuck off and that the people of the world have no right to decide their own destiny or to demand any kind of accountability cause evolved beings like himself know best.Cap doesnt necessarily have a problem with oversight considering hes previously taken orders as both a soldier of the army and as part of SHIELD.  The problem he has is with the wording of the document and the subsequent implications.  Yes he feels like theyd be better off on their own and taking responsibility of their own actions accordingly but after they captured Bucky he was willingly to sign the Accords so long as they changed the wording of it adding safeguards.

Id even like to see these shades between black and the dark colors show mid shot maybe with the suit slowly pooling over him to help show the fact that its alive.

The character is supposed to be nonwhite but its not a fair comparison because his being nonwhite is essential to the plot.

8673578,0,t1_d6pqby6,So describing the actress who might be MJ is making it about race? okay...And saying she should have red hair simply because that is what has been done before is barely an argument at all and a weak one. Its built on nothing more than nostalgia and seemingly an inability to follow a story if anything no matter how trivial is changed.There have been multiple movies made with Wolverine. NEVER has Wolverine been shown in his classic costume. Hell they even made him a six foot tall guy. Does that mean the depictions of Wolverine have been bad? NO because the costume wasnt even remotely important to what makes Wolverine an interesting character. Conversely in the two F movies of the early s the gave Jessica Alba blond hair and blue eyes  why cause in the comics Sue Storm has blond hair and blue eyes. Did that faithfulness do anything at all to make that depiction better? NO.FYI but the Movies are a fundamentally different media than comics one with fundamentally different ways of storytelling and one that due to its greater popularity has to appeal to a broader audience than the relatively small number of people who buy and read comics. The notion comic book fans have that faithfulness to a comic has anything to do with the quality of a comic book movie is nothing more than selfcentered whining and this is particularly true about the visuals which comic book fans get ridiculously hung up about.  Not having superman wear red underwear on the outside of his getup wasnt the end of Superman and changing a characters hair color wont matter either. What matters in a movie about Spiderman are capturing the main themes of Spiderman the charactera smart but selfconscious teen granted incredible powers and what he does with them. It is capturing THAT which makes a good Spiderman movie or not. The hair color of the love interest? Irrelevant. ,marvelstudios,d6pti3u,0,t5_2uii8

8728946,0,t1_d6wqpge,Its actually not as simple as that. Gunn is directing Guardians not Homecoming. Whatever he says about Guardians in no way applies to Homecoming. Common sense really. Also the info isnt just from one guy only. Its compiled from many sources. Nonetheless Im taking everything with a grain of salt except for the Zendaya casting for the reasons Ive already stated. The other rumours are in no way akin to the Zendaya one. Im certain that she will be playing Mary Jane. They might as well confirm it now. Otherwise everything Stan Lee and James Gunn has said thus far especially James Gunn in defence of Zendaya would have been for nothing. Heres what James Gunn had to say about her casting Why waste your time defending her casting if you knew it wouldnt amount to anything in the future? He isnt defending the other chan claims like he is this one. ,marvelstudios,d6wrfrv,0,t5_2uii8

8826914,0,t1_d78tjpp,gtIf you were watching a TV show where something big happens in one episode getting you excited for where they go in the series but then in that next episode in the first  minutes that major development is made obsolete. Youd be pissed right youd feel that youve been misled. Same thing here these movies promise big changes but those big changes never go anywhere. Without those changes already made in one instalment the next would still be exactly the same. Each movie cant focus on the movie that came before that would make the movie suck real hard. It has to advance keep going and explore new stories. EVERY movie in the MCU references and builds further upon what happened in previous movies and thats the right way to do it when youre building a universe like this. I really want you to list those big changes that are promised without mentioning the rainbow bridge and SHIELD in TWS. From the top of my head I can think of those Every movie before the Avengers sets up the origin stories for each character. Nothing major affecting each other here because it doesnt have to. The Avengers shows a world ending threat which leads to Tony Stark having PTSD in Iron Man  he references the events in NY ye? and S.H.I.E.LD going nuts with launching Project Insight in The Winter Soldier they references the events in NY ye?  and also makes Thanos aware of Earth and its heroes. The impact from The Avengers is therefor a big change in the MCU. Iron Man  sets up Tony as leaning more towards the idea of retiring. As stated in Age of Ultron Cho This will leave your metal suits in the dust Tony  Tony Well that is exactly the plan.In Civil War we learn that Tony doesnt really want to stop. Whether this is because he likes being Iron Man or because he feels guilty is not made clear. TWS sets up a universe where SHIELD doesnt exist anymore. This allows AoU to happen since the Avengers fills the role SHIELD normally would have fighting Hydra etc. Captain America TFA and Thor  ties in directly to The Avengers which proves your point wrong. Those solo movies affect the big team up movies.gtThe breaking of SHIELD has no major bearing on the of plot of AOUBut it does.. The breaking of SHIELD makes von Strucker secure the sceptre for Hydra as seen in the after or mid credit scene in TWS which leads to the Avengers retrieving it. Also proving that a solo movie affects the other movies.gtif it didnt happen then they probably would have gone for the sceptre anyway and Ultron would still have been recreated. If SHIELD was never infiltrated and basically controlled by Hydra then Tony would still have studied the sceptre. Thor would still have intended to return it to his home world.You really think that the plot would have been the same had SHIELD still existed? Even if they did go on to retrieve the sceptre Tony wouldnt have had the time to create Ultron as Thor wouldve just returned it to Asgard right away. The reason Tony investigates the sceptre is because Strucker used it for human experimentation and to see what all the fuzz was about. He had the sceptre for  days because the farewell partyparty for celebrating defeating all Hydra cells was  days from the day they retrieved the sceptre. He also tells Thor that he and Banner will check out what else the sceptre had been used for which wouldnt be the case had they retrieved it directly from SHIELD. Also had SHIELD existed during the events of AoU and had Ultron still been created they would have defeated him much easier considering the amount of resources SHIELD had. The Avengers wouldnt need to go into hiding and they could have pinpointed Ultron much earlier. Which means it wouldve been a totally different movie making your point invalid.gtIm not concerned with the comic tiein I have to read or the fact that there probably is a logical explanation for why Thor could return to Earth I am worried about how it affects the audience. That the biggest plot development in Thor is used as a throwaway line  which makes the viewer start wondering do these socalled emotional or important scenes really matter? Thor breaking the light bridge is a huge decision that character has to make we are even shown why throughout the film but in any sequel that is never explored. This argument is valid as I understand your point of view and I agree that its a flaw in the Thor franchiseThor gt MCU. But from my point of view its the only time that the MCU has kind of ignored what happened in a previous movie so Im neither bothered or worried about it. ,marvelstudios,d78vfg0,2,t5_2uii8

As far as you know youll be in prison for years at least and wont be able to be a normal father to your kids anymore. But hey at least you helped Steve and Bucky save lots of lives. Then Steve breaks you out of jail and tells you he was wrong and there was never any threat of the other Winter Soldiers toppling governments.

A trailer as an effective marketing tool is supposed to give the audience a basic idea of the movies story and characters without spoiling any surprises. But when you watch this trailer youre basically receiving a bunch of scattered details that make zero damn sense.Thats the point of a teaser trailer anyways it does makes sense to me.So Benedict Cumberbatch is a doctor who did good doctor things?Yep.But then something bad happens to him and oh no he has bruise makeup on his face?Hmm yep. Did you expect Marvel to ruin Beautifullbatch face or something?So he goes to some undefined part of Asia which other people need to tell me is Tibet? Why does he do this? I suppose I would have some idea if I had an inkling of this guys personality or background but alas.He arrives to Tibet expending his last pennies after trying everything to fix his hands. They wont tell you every single detail in a TEASER trailer.He meets Tilda Swinton who is living in Tibet and knows Tibetan magic because what? And thenCumberbatch learns magic and shit? And apparently he has potential but why does he want to explore his potential in corny magic instead of like dogtraining?It isnt Tibetan magic its just magic and she is just living on the Tibet.  Better train a Bulldog than keep saving lives but this time saving the whole world against otherdimensional enemies right?If you were expecting some big bad villain who hammers home the theme and the main source of conflict haha jokes on you.Im pretty sure you have no idea what the conflict is about and what has the villain to do with it. But thats the point again of a TEASER trailer.Its very bewildering because pretending theres no Marvel hype in the world what are people supposed to take from this? Hey if you want a movie that recycles visual effects from last years blockbusters and contains the spectacle of creepy racist magic this is the film for you? Man Marvels getting bold in all the worst ways.Hows magic racist? And wait and learn how they actually invented most of the VFX shown in movies like Inception or they actually did inspired Batmans Begin trip on the Doctors origin.,marvelstudios,d7qj67e,4,t5_2uii8

Watching s of AoS alongside The Flash and Arrow could have been something to do with it.  AoS had more plot progression in the first few episodes than Flash and Arrow had in their entire seasons nearly.  I was expecting things to be dragged out and revealed somewhere down the line but no next episode revealed.Though I do believe that AoS had really moved away from the Agents part of the title.  It seems that they are going back to that sort of formula this season with more recurring agent characters outside the main cast.,marvelstudios,d7ym930,1,t5_2uii8

9061295,0,t3_54alyi,Well Id be willing to help if at all possible but just to warn you this is an incredibly difficult task to undertake. Why? Because even within the MCU fandom there are debates on where certain things go chronologically. For instance is Iron Man  set in December of  or ? What year does Daredevil take place? These are two known examples of continuity errors that have fans debating the truth. I will give you this much Im only going to go by entire film rather than scene by scene. According to the Official MCU Phase  Timeline Iron Man  happens mostly before events of Thor  which both happen before the end of TIH and all three happen in the same week span. Most people will put them in release order since they all happen in the same week but according to the timeline more things happen in IM before they do in Thor  and basically just the ending of TIH is set in real time and it is clearly the end of Furys Big Week.,marvelstudios,d810spa,1,t5_2uii8

9147172,0,t1_d8beli6,Never did I say that blacks are being targeted more then other groups and neither did I try to force you to believe so the statistics youre bringing up are nonsense. The show does a good job in giving like another redditor said an educated view on the subject. It doesnt throw a bunch of hate towards police white people or target a certain group of people. It gives a message that is good for people in all shapes and sizes. And I believe it was brave and it was holding tons of meaning because regardless of what statistics say the communities that minorities and different people have are not the best. Many people are falling into the same stereotypes that their ancestors once fought to protect. And I think targeting one of the most grossing franchises in the world being that of Marvel Studios properties and or the MCU was something that not many networks would do. Especially when the message being sent is extremely positive and open for different forms of interpretation its not a black and white thing.  ,marvelstudios,d8bgxvl,2,t5_2uii8

I think they might not tee anything big up other than whatever one of the next solo films is since this is supposed to close a very large chapter. If they as some people suggest cut to the Silver Surfer out in space even if they managed to get the rights youre gonna get a ton of eye rolls as instantly Oh great another ten years of this again.Its definitely something that Feige and Co. are probably fretting about though how to set up the next thing without making it feel redundant. Ultimately it needs to be a very satisfying closer to that set of films otherwise the whole Infinity War thing will be labelled essentially a very long cocktease.

9262570,0,t3_5799qy,Well thats how it is with or without superhumans. You cant blame people for having natural strength. If superhumans are at fault because their strength invites challenge then shouldnt animals be allowed to slaughter humans all they want? We as homo sapiens are quite threatening to the natural world. While not as powerful as superhumans our very intellect is a strength in itself. In that case shouldnt we allow animals to start a humans registration act? Were killing everything with no oversight and act like were above all others. If the answer is that we are superior to animals then why dont we submit to aliens that are higher beings?Visions remark sounds wise but its obviously extremely skewed. He was desperately trying to become human that he would defend flawed human logic. Logically speaking all those registration act fuss is abnormal from an outsiders perspective. It only makes sense to humans because humans obviously want to survive. In which case theyll try to rationalize the destruction or control of any species they find threatening. If you think about it this way why would powerful species want to submit to that type of logic? Humans try to justify it based on morality but this morality is only applicable to humans. A lot of people try to make it sound fancy but in the end its just plain survival. In this case the superhumans obviously want to survive too. There is no right and wrong in this scenario.You dont blame nature for giving people strength. You blame the challengers who are trying to project their values on others. There is this thing called behavioral confirmation. If the challengers pick a fight first theyre going to get conflict.,marvelstudios,d8q3icb,5,t5_2uii8

Introduce Norman in the Spiderman film as a supporting character not quite a villain yet. The Skrulls are introduced in passing in Guardians or Captain Marvel or whatever. Then in the postcredits scene of the last film in the phase a Skrull replaces a hero.Phase  is the infiltration. It slowly builds in the background with the Skrulls dividing the Avengers. Norman will take a more active villainous role behind the scenes. This will culminate in him being put in charge of SHIELD. He aqquires HammerTech and rebrands SHIELD as HAMMER.Then you have phase  as Dark Reign. Thunderbolts appears as Normans new team as a sort of Dark Avengers.

9431004,0,t3_59uif6,I agree with you completely in concept. I thought Natasha and Bruce had a really interesting sort of chemistry in that first scene in India in Avengers .  Its also a huge peeve of mine when people act like strong female characters are inherently weakened by having a romantic arc  no one says male characters are weak or shallow because they have a love interest.  So I was pretty proWidowHulk going into the movie.However I think the actual way it played out was sort of clunky and weirdly paced.  I think it sort of got lost among all the characters old and new that Whedon had to balance. I love the idea of Natasha having an inner life and not being perfectly in control of her feelings.  But the feelingsdump monologue during the party scene felt really unnatural and writery to me and the resolution of her pushing Bruce off a cliff was not really all that satisfying to me.Im not on the mindless Whedon hate train here I think he was spinning a lot of plates with AOU and this one sort of got away from him but I was genuinely unsatisfied with something I expected to like.Edit And for all the criticism that I have I do not agree with the criticism Ive commonly heard that Natasha was reduced to a love interest.  I actually kind of think its the other way around!  The romantic story arc followed Natashas psychological journey more than it did Bruces who is the more passive player.  So while I might not have liked how it was handled I do at least think it was an attempt to develop Natasha and to put her in the drivers seat of her own storyline.,marvelstudios,d9bg078,66,t5_2uii8

9456512,0,t1_d9enmfq,gtYoure just giving me I want SpiderMan to be more successful because I liked him when I was a kid and Ive never branched out and learned about other characters so I think hes the best hero ever vibes.Thats awfully presumptuous of you Ashton.Where did he say that hes never branched out and explored other heroes before?Is it not possible that many have and in their own opinion find Peter Parker to be the best superhero? Its the same principle as any other character just because someone likes Peter more than say Tony or Steve doesnt mean they dont appreciate them it just means that Peter resonates with them more.Take me for instance SpiderMan wasnt the first superhero I was exposed to. The first hero I was exposed to and Im sure many others were too was Superman also the first superhero coincidentally. I watched Christopher Reeves Superman over and over again nonstop I got up early every morning to watch Superman the Animated Series because I was so entranced with the character.Clark will always hold a special place in my heart I love the Big Blue Boy Scout and still do. I only experienced SpiderMan after those early impressionable years of Superman worship and even then I knew that Peter was something really special.Maybe it was because I identified with Peter so much thought he looked so cool as SpiderMan the fact that his amazing abilities never seemed to solve any of his problems or that his overwhelming burden of responsibility almost bordered on obsession but its been that way ever since.So dont rag on somebody because SpiderMan is their favorite character and dont try to assume that they just havent opened their eyes yet to all of the other characters out there because anyones better than Peter overrated Parker right?Yeah that argument doesnt work with me so get off your highhorse and stop judging people for who and what they like.Also you lecturing somebody on their superiority complex?

Now maybe he didnt know about it but I find it hard to believe that he could have spent a fortune looking for a fix and not stumbled upon Helen Chos name.Could the cradle fix the extensive nerve damage in Stranges hands? I think we only saw it patching up Clints skin plus Vision but who the hell knows whats going on there. But more importantly the Cradle doesnt really matter in a universe where Extremis exists. But Marvel just quietly keeps ignoring it because its basically a cure for death.

9529844,0,t3_5bd2qp,I honestly thought if anything people would complain that this was a relatively similar role that Swinton had in Constantine as Gabriel.    FWIW I think this was a much better interpretation of the character and I think therein the problem started. Painting the Ancient One as this almost sort of inhuman matrixlike being that lives outside time I think is a much better concept than the mysterious bearded sorcerer. Referencing Constantine again I think based on roles like that they picked the lowhanging fruit because she is such a good actress and fits the role so well.    The part where Im hesitant to say is that arguing the character should have been Asian when the best actor for the what I believe to be superior interpretation of the character is white seems pretty silly. ,marvelstudios,d9nr5pt,3,t5_2uii8

Daredevil is the detectiveno powers side with a similar origin except he isnt rich and has more heart in my opinion Ive always thought Batman was a bit fascist. Punisher is Batman taken to the extreme no powers prodigious combat abilities but unhinged utterly uncompromising and willing to kill people ala Batman in BvS. Tony Stark is like Bruce Wayne a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist except thats who he actually is rather than a mask for Batman.  With Supes Sentry and Cap are the analogues  Sentry is Superman with his powers but with a dark crazy side and Cap is like Superman except without the powers. ,marvelstudios,d9pfmr0,1,t5_2uii8

9584752,0,t1_d9tytxk,I think the problem lies in peoples perceptions of the characters because of how their introductions to and treatment in the MCU. Tony was introduced as and has been consistently displayed as a deeply flawed and morally grey character. Therefore when he does something badwrong its expected and the audience is forgiving because hes trying to do well in spite of his flaws.On the other hand Steve was introduced as and has been consistently displayed as a saintlike character who is always right. Even when everyone else says hes wrong he has still ended up right. That is until Civil War when he does something badwrong in not telling Tony about his parents.  To be wrong is so outside of everything that the audience has been told about the character that  the audience feels betrayed that the righteous man could be wrong. Now this one bad decision by the righeous character overshadows the many bad decisions by the already flawed and gray character.,marvelstudios,d9uilff,7,t5_2uii8

But IMO its clear from the dialogue in Age of Ultron and from how the rest of the Infinity Stones are depicted as dangerous objects safely within some sort of container that while Vision is the protector of the Mind Stone but he doesnt need it to survive.Now would Thanos be willing to kill Vision to take the Mind Stone away from him? Of course. But will the actual removal of the Mind Stone be what kills Vision? No I dont think so. Also Vision is pretty much indestructible. And an android.

Joker does not have a reason and he is so great is because we know nothing about him. And Joker is an extremely simple character. Lex in BvS has no mannerisms that the Joker would have his portrayal is more like that of lets say Isaac Newtonin the first half than of Jokers. Lex shows his more crazy side in the second halfshown through subtle mannerisms in acting and it makes sense for him to.Also Lex being a cold bald villain was just one part of his character. I mean he was bald all the time but his character represented the big people of our timesLex was a scientist and then kind of a dictator like you know who and then became a bit more money hungry like businessmen in the last s and the Lex in BvS represents young geniuses like the most obvious example being Mark Zuckerberg.Lexs plan made sense but it was too complex for its own good.,marvelstudios,d9zqbp7,1,t5_2uii8

9778864,0,t3_5f8v40,gt Because of this there are scenes that I feel are much more awkward than funnyI didnt feel like nay of those were out of place. I felt like they highlighted the fact that for as brilliant as Strange is hes not the playboy that Stark is able to smooth over almost any social situation with a glib bit of snark. Instead hes socially awkward and when he tries to play it cool it almost always comes off as cringe worthy.gtMy only other gripe is that the pacing was a bit off. Stephen isnt shown training nearly as much as I feel like he should have. I dont know if this is pacing or just a failure in the storytelling. He did train for roughly a year. If you pay attention to the leaves in Kamar Taj they go through a full autumngtautumn colour cycle from when he gets there to when Kaecillius starts attacing Sanctums. Plus if you watch every time he confronts Dormammu and you see him actually harness magic to try and defend himself it seems to get better and better. There was apparently one cycle cut from that scene where Strange basically says Are you ready to bargain yet weve been at this literally thousands of times. So that could have been additionally years where he literally did nothing but practice fighting things with his magic and no one would remember it except him and Dormammu.,marvelstudios,daigkuk,16,t5_2uii8

First he is imprisoned by his former teammates with whom he has the deep relationships you described who are now aware that he is a human chameleon capable of anything. Yet he still tries to manipulate them and play on them  and even though he does not really succeed it is genuinely sinister. Then he escapes and nobody knows whos side hes on. Hes delivering Hydra heads to SHIELD then gives Skye to HYDRA only to fullfill his promise to reunite her with her dad who hates HYDRA but only pretends to work with them. Then gets shot by Skye and catches the ride on the outcast bus with Agent .  Which is where my favourite part starts because they are two extremely capable loose cannons maneuvering through the SHIELDHYDRAInhumans war working solely to fullfill their own personal vendettas. I remember them being my favourite characters beside Skyes dad at that point.All in all season  was packed.And then they fcked it up by killing Agent  in the dumbest way possible and having Ward go the way clichd illogical villain before turning him into a space squid zombie.,marvelstudios,davm5io,43,t5_2uii8

He wanted Bucky to still be brainwashed after breaking him out and have him arrive at Siberia after he escaped from Germany. That way Zemo hoped Cap and Iron Man will follow him together and Zemo will be able to present them the tape along with Bucky either in Siberia or somewhere else so that they can fight over him then.The problem was that Bucky was intercepted by Cap and brought back to his senses setting the airport battle into motion and then going to Siberia with Cap and without Tony.When Zemo saw that on TV on the airport he adjusted his plan sent the cleaning lady into his hotel room to find the body knowing that would out him to Iron Man and hopefully got him on track.To put it simply since Captain pulled Buckys helicopter back to the ground Zemos initial plan fell apart and he had to improvise so he tried to get Tonys attention to hurry him up and reunite him with Cap so that he could break them afterwards with the tape anyway.Doesnt make the initial plan bad there was just too much other stuff going on the rift in the Avengers because of the Accords that it got sidetracked.

And even then the webline itself would have to have been shot ridiculously far. Not to mention look at the line at the end in the freezeframe.The endpoint is still ahead of the shot. Which not only doesnt really match up to the hypothetical arc above it would mean he fired the webline at a building over a block ahead of him and over at least two buildings. Like I said its nowhere near as egregious as the old SpiderMan films where you had Spidey swinging over rooftops with his webline presumably attaching to the moon. Its a lot less noticeable and indeed if not for this gif Id probably not have noticed it at all. It just strikes me as odd cause Id have figured theyd have sat down and made it a hard rule to attach to buildings. But nah seems like theyre taking the Spidey games approach Kinda sorta could be attached but they fudge it to get the good long swing shots they want.

And it sold M worth in the USA possibly  globally.As for the rest of what you said  all of that is true of any film that became a minor pop culture phenomenon. You cant just pull M out of it was really popular. The fact that it was really popular is what gives it such a good chance of making as much money as it did the first time  it doesnt get that for free. There are dozens of examples I could talk about  Iron Man XMen SpiderMan that support my position. But theres one thats particularly special and relevant. Star Wars. Whacky scifi space opera huge critical and commercial success against the odds. Star Wars was a way bigger phenomenon back in  than GotG was in  but their stories are otherwise very similar.  years later do you know how much Empire Strikes Back made? M less than Star Wars.

So theres no reason tho think any of this is likely to happen. Especially the Mind Gem part which has the wee snag of being in Visions skull.

His life isnt supposed to be easy. Its sacrifice with little to no reward. Thats why hes a hero. The larger slightly more sinister spider emblem reflects the growing control the suit had over him. Plus it just looks dope.There is none of that here. It looks like someone just took the fill bucket tool to the normal suit and called it a day.

I think that Cap and Iron Man could be on an even keel in a fight and thus two against one in that sort of power scale I put Bucky up with Cap after Winter Soldier had them on even footing I could see Iron Man being overwhelmed. Plus he was blind with rage and not thinking tactically or intelligently just in fury and revenge. Plus he still took down Bucky and might have beat Cap had slight things gone differently.

He might not be the focus of the scene but he surely left his mark literally and figuratively on Tony.Because they arent the main characters. But not being main characters it doesnt make them less important. War Machine and Falcon help the white hero and are still compelling and unique characters. Other white heroes help other white heroes too. Natasha Clint Wanda Bucky Sif Volstagg Fandral Odin Dey all help the main heroes but they are never the main characters themselves. By the way forgot to talk about Singh and Yen but they were members of the World Security Council the greatest MCU faction that oversaw SHIELD and Fury itself. By showing an Indian and Chinese man in this position of power means that both countries are playing a major part in world peacekeeping and security.Im not saying your arguments about Asian characters are mostly invalid but there is no secret agenda to lack of Asian characters and characters from multiple backgrounds are constantly in introduction in the MCU.,marvelstudios,dcgirpq,3,t5_2uii8

I know that those  characters are really strong but  based on their established lore and powers they should rip through most enemies like nothing.Now i admit that it would make the movies kind of short and boring because big bosses defeated in a second. But this proves my point even more  stop nerfing strong characters just for the sake of fitting your story. Create a story that would allow them to show off their power whereas weaker characters could fight elsewhere different enemies or support strong heroes.I hate this in every setting not just with Thor and Hulk any story that does this is just lazy story telling in my eyes. Even though i can still enjoy as a whole i just grumble about it.I look at it this way. Even a weak enemy can be strong depending how they play their cards. Take Joker and Batman for example. I think that in a hand to hand combat even if weapons were allowed Batman would win. But Joker being the tricky bastard...,marvelstudios,dd24boc,0,t5_2uii8

Also the Doctor Strange DVD has sneak peeks for Guardians  Ragnarok Black Panther and Infinity War. No SpiderMan even though it comes out before three of those movies.

So not a high school romance.Peter met Gwen Stacy as an undergrad at Empire State U.He met M.J. when he was going to college as well  not in high school.I am open to being corrected but I maintain that Peter shouldnt have much or any success with the ladies in high school as he is an introverted personality as Peter Parker  its only when he puts on the costume of SpiderMan that he can crack jokes or be wordy at all. The dual nature of him as SpiderMan is that he gets to release his character and powers from behind a mask but must do so very carefully and for the right reasons as Bens death famously taught him.,marvelstudios,dd755wn,1,t5_2uii8

10615669,1,t1_ddaw3td,Click on the Free Form image to open the Press Release.Whats happening here is called linkjacking which goes against reddiquette and ethical journalism. Its a common problem on this subreddit in particular with MCU Exchange. The moderators are currently looking into the problem that has been brought up to them on numerous occasions.Rule number  of this subreddit used to read Posts regarding news must be linked to the ORIGINAL source.In the last week the moderators have changed that rule which now allows for linkjacking. While the original rule was in place the linkjacked MCU Exchange articles were not taken down. MCU Exchange has also now benefited from this rule change. This is truly unfortunate that the moderators allow for this but with one of MCU Exchanges staff being a moderator and a number of users of this subreddit also on staff at MCU Exchange making things go according to the rules has been slow at best. While this post is inline with the subreddits rules as they currently read it is not inline with Reddits policiesguidelines.It goes deeper than that though. According to the Reddit User Agreement moderators may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from thirdparties. Also when moderators receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement on subreddits they moderate they agree to remove it. So not only is it against Reddits User Agreement for any post to appear on this subreddit to MCU Exchange as long as umurdockmanila is both on staff at MCU Exchange and a moderator of this subreddit but the other moderators having received notice of this happening are also knowingly going against the User Agreement as well.MCU Exchange staffer and current rmarvelstudios moderator umurdockmanila once said Once MCUExchange becomes the spammy low quality site that commonly gets shit on here it WILL go.However after checking umurdockmanilas Submissions  of his last  posts have been to MCU Exchanges website Youtube page or images with MCU Exchange logo. According to Reddits Guidelines on Self Promotion You should submit from a variety of sources a general rule of thumb is that  or less of your posting and conversation should link to your own content... umurdockmanila is currently at just over  of posts to MCU Exchange and its content. This is extreme abuse of the moderator position. The same can be said for uredwurm MCU Exchanges EditorinChief whose submissions are at  of the last  posts  for MCU Exchange.Its perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website its not okay to be a website with a reddit account.This abuse from MCU Exchange in particular hasnt stopped at the constant linkjacking that is allowed to remain on this subreddit or the constant spam from two of its staffers and one of our own moderators. Hopefully this subreddits moderators do come to a conclusion soon on how they are going to handle this.,marvelstudios,ddaxcfu,-4,t5_2uii8

10703417,0,t1_ddjk1fw,I think its that the Marvel franchise is long enough that its surprising that there really hasnt been a terrific villain. Loki people like well enough but I still dont think hes on the same level as what something like the Dark Knight did in one film with JokerTwoFace. For the most part Marvels villains have just been very onenote and straight forward to a fault. Zemo was probably by far the most wellwritten villain in that he had actual specific goals a sympathetic backstory and wasnt just shot through the head to end the film or hop into a suit of amor and get beaten.Magneto works as a villain so well specifically because hes layered hes both sympathetic and hateable reasonable but also hypocritical. His backstory works so well to establish how he became a hardliner against humanity even though he doesnt understand how hypocritical his own extremism is having come from a concentration camp...  It sucks Magnetos been so overused but I really cant think of a Marvel Studios villain that has reached those heights and I dont really think if they had him theyd use him as well .. say what you will about Fox but it takes balls to show a concentration camp in a superhero movie. When Marvel had to deal with WWII you could see they were very intentionally avoiding the more disgusting aspects of WWII Nazis are sidelined immediately and laser guns etc..,marvelstudios,ddjz7qa,5,t5_2uii8

10799089,0,t1_ddtemhh,This is the right answer. In Civil War shes going through serious selfdoubt and a fear that people see her as a monster. Shes done some pretty awful things in the past some on purpose mindscrewing the Avengers and some by accident the incident in Lagos losing her temper with Vision and shes clearly very conflicted about all of it. Mindscrewing the entire group of people present wouldnt have exactly been a good way to win trust with the group hence why she stuck to physical attacks.

If the comic readers were like oh thats just some small time character or they didnt know who that character was that doesnt generate buzz for the next movie.

Plus his endgame makes more sense. Why else would he openly start tearing stuff up? Because he knows Hydra has a nice safe house waiting for him.Hammer was probably a low level replacement. Hydras new world order is gonna need someone to make all the bullets the difference is Hammer was an insufferable little shit in comparison to Stane so Hydra probably dropped him or threatened him to make sure he stayed silent.

10884667,0,t3_5vj9uf,I started watching near the end of Sbeginning of S? Friends kept telling us to watch so my husband and I binged on whatever was available on Netflix we almost didnt get past the first half of S but we were glad when we did and started to keep up weekly on TV. S was kind of a drag to keep up with  my husband tapped out completely and I would wait until I had a handful of episodes saved to try to power through them as best I could. Im pretty sure I still missed  or  episodes near the end of the season though and just watched the finale. Ive been watching S solo and its entertaining enough but definitely not appointment TV with last nights episode as a very rare exception  I heard enough chatter about it that I actually watched LIVE. It was worth it that specific episode was THAT good.But heres my problem with the show...I like the characters enough and the stories are interesting enough but it never really blows my mind. I watch a lot of TV and I admit to being kind of a TV snob so Im pretty spoiled by good television. Thats not to say that one cant watch TV just because its plain entertaining because I think thats something AoS does pretty well but when Im trying to weigh what to watch I will always prioritize excellent writing storytelling and character development over just entertaining. Throw in the fact that its still a traditional  episode season and I just literally dont have time for that. AoS has had some great moments in the course of its run and by S Ive legitimately grown fond of the characters even though they sometimes dont make any goddamn sense. They hooked me enough last night that I will tune in regularly to see how the last arc plays out...Im just really hoping they can maintain the level of quality established in this midseason finale and get us to a satisfying high quality conclusion...if they dont make it past this season that would be a wonderful way to go out. ,marvelstudios,de2ocer,2,t5_2uii8

10960944,0,t1_dea09yk,I dont understand this reasoning at all. I get why people liked Cottonmouthhes unstable puts a semiunique spin on the Gang Boss archetype and has a lot of interesting character contradictionsbut frankly I dont see why hes so much more beloved than Diamondback. His personality is unnerving not quite Punisherlevel but he comes close the actor goes as far as he can and sells the hell out of the whole if Cain didnt finish Abel off personality andmost of allhe actually manages to get the plot moving.You point this out yourself in a waygt  it was much more interesting to see Luke Cage have to deal with a villain which he couldnt just beat up.In a sense yes. But it also at least partially caused the plot to let the air out of its tires because the writers realized that they couldnt just Luke and Cottonmouth be in the same room together after the first episode unless they came up with a copout reason why he couldnt just beat the shit out of him let the cops raid the nightclub and find enough evidence to bury him. This is in part why the first half of the show lags so much. When you take a step back and look at the overall structure of the season very little movement towards anyones end goals actually happens up until Diamondback comes in with the Judas bullets Cottonmouth tries to screw over Luke and keeps failing while Luke tries to find evidence against him and also keeps failing to a degree thats honestly a little silly when you think about it the guy deals in militarygrade arms and pays corrupt cops under the table but theres no paper trail to be found?. You could even argue that the most significant thing that Cottonmouth himself did was die since Mariah has to pay Candace to lie about it and Candaces life and death is basically the crux of Mistys arc which ultimately is what threatens to bring down the whole criminal empire.Its not like there arent valid reasons to criticize the second half of the show. But theres an equal amount to critique the first half on and Cottonmouth being a villain who doesnt really add a lot to the plot though he certainly does add a lot to the flavour of the show is one of them.,marvelstudios,deajl73,9,t5_2uii8

10998878,0,t1_deejlum, The visions of infinity stones and well trip were unnecessary. Just have the Vision turned on instead of powered by lightning at the last minute and the entire Thor subplot can be taken out. I mean Tony and Bruce were literally going to switch Vision on before Steve and the twins showed up so theres no reason for Thor to come and blast the body with lightning frankenstein style outside of giving him something to do because aou really seemed like it had no clue what it should be doing with the character.Thor could have learned about all the stones showing up in his vision then decided to wait until he went back to Asgard to investigate because hed seen at least  up close tesseract mind gemsceptre and the aether...so its not like he couldnt have been written to have a clearer vision and recognize what they were immediately especially since we know hes had the most experience with Infinity stones out of the entire team. Hed know what the stones were but prioritize Ultron over finding out more about them and boom that sub plot is eliminated because Thor is supposed to have a thousand years or so of knowledge and experience.So yeah you could take a fair chunk of the movie out or tweak it just a bit and things wouldnt be so clunky. Hell outside of Tony and Bruce giving the others visions did nothing except take them out so we could get the Hulkbuster fight without interruptions. If you wanted to cut the Hulkbuster fight then that could be taken out by having Wanda trap Bruce in a peaceful trance or something and thats another    mins that could have been used differently. I enjoyed the Hulkbuster fight but it would have been very interesting having a moment where they need the Hulk but Bruce cant transform at that moment.The Klaw subplot was okay because of the vibranium and its connection to Ultron etc but if they wanted to take that out then he couldve been introduced in a panther film with references to him losing his hand against TChaka.I know some people will disagree because these things paid off to an extent in Civil War and will pay off some more in Black Pantherpossibly Ragnarok and of course Infinity War but I still think Age of Ultron had so much potential that was squandered in favor of setting things up. Of course theres nothing I can do at this point but gripe about it.,marvelstudios,deeou29,1,t5_2uii8

11072524,0,t3_5y304n,Im fairly sure that at least half of it was intentional. Marvel saw that the Avengers model worked amazingly well and wanted to bring the same thing to TV shows. Thus  different TV shows each centered around a different hero followed by a teamup series.As far as the IM DD S parallel that was not intentional the original contract with Netflix did not include any second seasons. However I dont think its fair to call it a coincidence either. Both arose from similar circumstances the first entry was a breakout success but it would be years before the teamup so a sequel was planned to capitalize on the success while sequels to the other entries remained planned for after the teamup. ,marvelstudios,den26ju,6,t5_2uii8

We know it is at Christmas time and we know it takes place six months after the Battle of New York.  It is never established what year the Battle of New York takes place but everyone assumes its the same year it came out .The Newspaper in IM is key to this line of thinking.gt Such as the main plot happening around that date despite The Dark World happening before. So I am agreeing with youSetting it during Christmas  established why Thor isnt there to help hes in England and why SHIELD isnt there either mid season break of season  had SHIELD taking out Centipede bases all over the globe making their presence sparse in the States during the holidays.gt I think the postcredits of Iron Man  happened much later than that dateYou are correct the voice over at the beginning plus the end scene sets up that it is told as flashback.,marvelstudios,deu7ou2,1,t5_2uii8

Unless of course you place arbitrary limits on it like not allowing a white character that goes to a different culture and assimilates because its cultural appropriation.

But if being white limits the stories then they just shouldnt make the show at all not change races.I think youre misunderstanding me here Im not saying we shouldnt have an Asian hero. Im saying we should have an Asian hero thats actually Asian not one thats been changed just to fill a racial quota. This hero shouldnt be made Asian. That is at best patronizing and really just another form of stereotyping.

11201930,0,t1_df1owxy,Haha. See Sam and Steve had already known each other MUCH BETTER than Steve and Sharon when Sam risked his career and freedom for Steve. Sam and Steve were basically friends already by this moment. Sharon helped Cap immediately without asking any questions. Also its pretty different situations. Sam knew that SHIELD went crazy for trying to kill Captain America and Black Widow and for killing Fury. SHIELD was a bunch of criminals not Cap. On the other hand there is no black and white in Civil War. Bucky killed many innocent people in Berlin including Sharons colleagues and hurt Sharon herself. She would have every reason to believe that arresting Bucky or simply having Bucky in protective custody even if she believe he wasnt responsible for his actions would be the right thing. Also she worked in the antiterrorist center. Its her job to investigate Zemo and catch him not Steves. So yeah her actions speak for themselves. She is madly in love with Steve. Steve is not stupid he saw it and thanked her as she wanted. Thats it.So you know I just hope they wont repeat this in IW. If there going to be Cap  then develop Sharon in Cap  but IW is totally not the place and time for another SteveSharon mess. So just drop it for now and I wont hold any hard feelings for this CWs mistake. IF they build the whole relationship on this then it will be a big fail.,marvelstudios,df1q3au,1,t5_2uii8

11222154,0,t1_df40416,. I dont consider it much of a controversy. I am not offended that they kept him white though I acknowledge it may have been a missed opportunity to do something interesting. I think many are conflating their very understandable issues with the roles available for asian especially male actors with what this show actually did.. The benefit of him being Asian American would be the ability to play on peoples like your expectations for how an AsianAmerican would be perceived in a culture that is supposedly his. For him to reconcile his Americanness with the cliches of Asian culture. It would have been an opportunity to comment on the very situation that people are upset about Asian characters constantly being solely mystical others rather than actual nuanced people. It would have been subversive to have an AsianAmerican actor in the role doing the expected KungFu stuff while also participating in the rich people and personal drama that the series had. That metacommentary would have went over well just as it did in Jessica Jones and Luke Cage over their respective issues.And even if you dont agree with all of that. If neither his whiteness nor possible asianness is particularly important then what does it matter? There are plenty of heroes that could be raceswapped without much of an issue and hes probably one of them.,marvelstudios,df40mqp,2,t5_2uii8

Hes the only reason that mantle has meaning.  Let Sam and Bucky create their OWN meaning in their OWN characters. They are more than capable of it.  The comics are lazy as hell with their mantle passing.  I agree with Anthony Mackie that being the first Falcon is way more important than being the second or third Captain America so do something with that Falcon is awesome how does he become more awesome giving him someone elses shield and giving him a red white and blue costume?

I cant count how many shows I have watched over the years that didnt start out with downfall or stigma attached to it only for it to become better and better as time went on. I walked into Iron Fist with the notions that it was going to be boring and drab only to have those notions blown away as I got further into it.  I wanted more with each episode always questioning the next wondering if there was going to be some darker twist at the end. Yeah a lot of it was lackluster in ways of story telling acting or choreography but they also did some pretty cool things along the way. I will say that I liked IF as a character I had never heard of IF before now and this show made want to find out more about him. I like that in a show. DD never did that for me after the movie with Ben Afleck I didnt want to know more. Now that isnt to say that the Show isnt better on a much larger margin the character itself is boring to me. Its the same with Superman or Batman. When a show makes me research a character and become obsessed with finding out every little bit of who that character is it did something right. I am excited to see this character fleshed out more and I am certain that it will only get better as put more time into what they missed with the first season. ,marvelstudios,dfghq8a,5,t5_2uii8

No. Ill wait and see what others think.I just havent been impressed with any of Bucks work. I havent watched all of Six Feet Under but from the episodes I have seen it didnt do anything special for me. The Dexter fiasco has been beaten to death at this point. And Iron Fist was meh for the most part. Its not that hes completely incompetent. I just dont feel that the work he does is very inspired and it shows in his track record.

He could wield Mjlnir until Odin made him not only unworthy but also took his powers.Cap did not try to talk about Bucky. He told Falcon that Tony probably wasnt going to help them and that is all he ever said about talking to TonyWidow was already on the side of the accords when Ross talked to them. She was arguing for them not against them. Also did your quote prove my point because she said that the easy choice is this time the right choice.Your points about Vanko and Stand are just not relevant because Stark didnt create those threats he was just the target.Widow didnt agree as did Panther. TChalla didnt gave a flying fuck about the accords he just wanted to get Wakanda safe through the UN meet AGREEING on the accords.My last point also stands. Only at fault are Loki Thanos and S.H.I.E.L.D. for the invasion. Stark is a narcissist but he didnt create the threat. He also took the Stark Tower and made it the Avengers Tower.

I think it was wise for the Cap writers to include someone like Bucky who presents motivation for Cap both in line with what we consider in character loyal brave good but also pushes him to act outside of the confines of just Captain America. It allows them to explore where Steve begins and where Cap ends.Bucky by definition cannot be a MacGuffin because a MacGuffin is both crucial to the plot but also relatively unimportant to the narrative. So a treasure the heroes are after is what causes them to go into all their shenanigans but the treasure itself serves no extra purpose or motivating factor beyond just... being a treasure. It could be gold jewels bonds sacred artifactsit doesnt matter. Bucky cant be interchanged with some random HYDRA agent or even one of Caps old cohorts and allow the plot to remain intact.

It was Eternity who calls Hank the Scientist Supreme he says Reed is the Explorer Tony is the Engineer Hank is the Mage  he takes Science to the very point of Magic.  So yeah in the comics apparently theyre like two sides of a coin which can look very like each other at times.Maybe Im underestimating the average viewer.Frankly I think its actually a lot more interesting when theres a spectrum from pure science to pure magic.  And at a certain point it gets ridiculous to distinguish between shoots lightning from his hands because of chemicals shoots lightning from his hands because of extradimensional energies and shoots lightning from his hands because of magic.  Its almost boring to me when Magic is referred to as something totally incomprehensible because its almost always studied within that same work.  Like a lot of works have the Rules of Magic which for all intents and purposes means its something that can be studied categorized and quantified.  Even if Magic has different rules or comes from a different world it still has rules and a source.  Magic is a subject Science is a method. rant I guess?,marvelstudios,dg3jo41,4,t5_2uii8

11559563,0,t3_64yvvw,I think GOTG will have one post credit some callback to the nova core and introduce Adam Warlock and that will create hype. James Gun doesnt like working with Thanos so he most likely wont be in the movie maybe posts but unlikely Spiderman I remember hearing will have two post credits one setting up a Spiderman sequel and the second one could be Iron man meeting with Spiderman to start training and joining the Avengers that is if Tony brings Peter into the light and has to sign the accords. Thor will probably have two One with Grandmaster and collector meeting or alternatively the Grandmaster meeting with Thanos. The second could be Thor bringing Banner back the earth and maybe have a joke or two Black Panther This one more than likely will tie in to Infinity War with TChalla and Rogers walking through Wakanda after all is done and Tony flies in lands and tells Cap that there is bigger things at play here and the team needs to assemble. The second one or maybe the same post credit just different scene. We cut to thanos or the black order landing on earth looking for vision.    ,marvelstudios,dg6a49s,1,t5_2uii8

11560554,0,t3_6507cc,My hopeObviously the AntManWasp Black Panther Captain Marvel Doctor Strange Guardians of the Galaxy and SpiderMan franchises will continue. Plus the Avengers films.That leaves Black Widow Captain America Hawkeye Hulk Iron Man Scarlet Witch Falcon War Machine Vision Winter Soldier and Thor without franchises. Maybe one or two of these heroes will die in Infinity War.Im hoping for Black Widow to get her own trilogy so she wouldnt need to guest star in anyone elses films. I would also love for a Scarlet Witch and the Vision movie but I dont think it is as likely.So then wed have Cap and he honestly could fit into any one of the franchises.I could see Hawkeye being in a Black Widow or AntMan and the Wasp film.I dont really know whos film Hulk would guest star in. I think its  more likely that hes just held for Avengers sequels.Iron Man could really fit into any of the franchises.Then I can see Scarlet Witch being in Doctor Strange or Captain Marvel. Vision could be in Doctor Strange AntMan and the Wasp or Captain Marvel movie.Falcon could fit into a lot of different movies. I think Winter Soldier could probably fit into a Black Widow or Black Panther movie. War Machine would probably just be saved for Avengers movies and Thor could really show up anywhere.Although again some of these characters will die.Id love to see every character that is alive and doesnt have their own movie in Phase  show up in another solo movie. And then obviously the Avengers teamup can focus on whoever they want hopefully the classic Avengers like Cap Witch Wasp Vision and AntMan.,marvelstudios,dg6e61q,1,t5_2uii8

I imagine whatever distribution deal Disney has with other cable networks in the UK is why its not happening. People have to remember Netflix is just one distributor out of hundreds. Its more popular today because anyone can just sign up for it but they can only get the films and shows that others didnt out bid them for in the first place.

11673081,0,t1_dgj2n8y,I dont work in a theater or have a very thorough knowledge on the technical side but worked at a post production house editing coloring mixing etc that created DCPs for many of our clients  so I dont think I could give you the most thorough answer. From what I do know though there isnt any streaming unless its a special live steaming event like the Met Opera though I assume this uses a different protocol than DCP. With a normal film the theater will receive one copy of the DCP hard drive which is then copied onto their servers and can then be played on multiple screens in the theater not played directly off the drive. I am assuming that the crasheserrors youve experienced are errors between the theaters servers where the files are stored and the computers handling playbackprojection for the individual screen which may be set up in a fashion similar to an RDP  though again Im not sure what the exact technical set up is. DCPs can be sent via satellite to theaters though this isnt the norm for major films due to security concerns. Though once again they would be downloaded and copied to the servers first similar to copying the hard drive and not played back directly from the satellite feed.Maybe someone who works in a theater or distribution could chime in? uHalfBloodMockingjay do you have any infocorrections?,marvelstudios,dgj5rms,3,t5_2uii8
