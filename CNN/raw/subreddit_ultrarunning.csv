5187081,0,t1_cvayw8a,Ive worked hard the past few months on the hydration  nutrition issue. I am really really glad I ate watermelon during a long training run and had the shits in July not this Sunday haha. Its going to be mid s and I grew up right around the corner in Killington so Im pretty lucky. Im not big on gels but I love Health Warrior Chia Bars have them in my drop bags and a pocket of my Camelbak.,ultrarunning,cvb8ev8,1,t5_2thxz

6978668,0,t1_d16l8cz,Hey for dealing with the terrain?  Just finding similar terrain to practice on really.  Leaning into the downhills rather than leaning back will save your butt on the slippery sections.  Uphills just get some good power hiking in cause youll probably be walking a lot of uphills.Got a good tip from a Gary Robbins seminar last year and that was to have one really hard all out downhill workout I think around when you start to taper it made a difference in my downhill speed on race day.Otherwise get on rrunning there are some ultra guys way out of my league who can chime in too.  Also what race? It sounds brutal,ultrarunning,d17dcco,1,t5_2thxz

8784365,0,t3_50dw97,Two thing I recommend one focus your training on overall mileage and two practice ultramarathonstyle running slow shuffle pace walk breaks at regular intervals smooth transitions between running and walking. If you can race a half then a good runwalk strategy can easily make it last  miles without wiping you out.Workouts that are not about base mileage should address maintaining form while fatigued mental fortitude runwalk transitions running and walking form logistics gear nutrition and other such technicalities. Sounds trivial but these things can make or break the experience running with a backpack assuming you wont have full external support,ultrarunning,d73pv60,3,t5_2thxz
9099467,0,t3_54rj7w,Thanks for the comments. I think thats a great point to not treat the K like an A race. Ill have to keep that in mind if I do sign up. ,ultrarunning,d85lxgm,1,t5_2thxz
9251696,0,t3_54rj7w,Three weeks is cutting it close.  I start tapering for my  milers about  weeks. for example I have a  miler on  Nov and I am running a training K this Saturday.  I do have a  miler scheduled for the th too.  ,ultrarunning,d8opwpk,1,t5_2thxz

As mentioned in another comment hes the only person who actually has a fully documented with GPS tracks by Garmin GPS like a Spot device and on Strava of the whole run so shouldnt be a problem to validate the claim.,ultrarunning,d96f9wj,4,t5_2thxz
9590538,0,t3_5cb0fw,Hi there! Im new to the sub too but not to running. If you like the postgym feel you will probably love running once you get through the initial period. You seem to have a ton of energy so you might breeze through that. But typically it takes people a few months to really get hooked so be patient. About speed not yet! Go slow. You should be able to talk out loud to yourself or a running partner. If you have to alternate between walking and jogging as needed. Gradually increase the time jogging and decrease the walking time. Those sessions should last  minutes each. Try to get to  minutes of nonstop jogging. Youre so young you can probably do that in  weeks. Maybe do it  days a week depending on how your leg muscles feel. If you need more detail you can google Couch to K and use that schedule. You may be able to jump to the later end of it. I hope you love it!  ,ultrarunning,d9v8afj,4,t5_2thxz
10888424,0,t3_5vl67k,I was very nervous for my first race as well but it was a great experience and I now do  races a year. For me it is always so amazing how encouraging everyone is no matter what your time is. It feels trite at times but honestly someone giving me a thumbs up and saying awesome job while running is just kinda the best feeling ever.My piece of advice would be to not let you time or even whether you complete the course determine your experience. Go out and do the best you can without injuring yourself and relax and enjoy whatever experience you end up having. ,ultrarunning,de32alo,5,t5_2thxz
10894710,0,t1_de35ntd,If youve been out injured dont try and do a k training run  especially for a k race. Its way too much.For k I usually follow a marathon training plan and its worth picking up a copy of Advanced Marathoning by Pete Pfitzinger which has some really useful reading about how to approach race day and also a section on what to do if injury does derail your training schedule as its not an uncommon problem.Confidence is definitely key though and when looking at a big target like an ultra on race day plan your race in smaller sections and then it doesnt feel as overwhelming. Go checkpoint to checkpont for example. Good luck!,ultrarunning,de3pn5n,3,t5_2thxz
10993186,0,t3_5wz13q,The weekly mileage seems reasonable although I would consider moving your  mile runs to the middle of the week occasionally maybe swap with your hill repeats if you can fit it into your schedule. I dont think you need to do backtoback long runs every weekend.Multiple consecutive weeks of  mile long runs seems a little excessive but its probably fine as long as you pay attention to any nagging pains. Dont risk injury by forcing yourself to hit these exact mileages.Try to make sure your long runs are on terrain thats similar to where youll be racing and use those runs as an opportunity to practice your race day nutrition. Also practice hiking uphill since this is a skill that most people neglect.Good luck!,ultrarunning,dee1k29,3,t5_2thxz
11365796,0,t3_6203hk,Most training plans cycle between a gradual build to a peak over maybe three weeks and then a down week.  Ideally you would want to peak around  weeks before a race but everyone is different and theres really no onesizefitsall. I really like the idea of running the thirty five weeks out have the days off a light recovery week and then maybe a minipeak three weeks out . Drop down to a  and  for the last two taper weeks.  Or just something super light and comfortable. What we fear is that well lose some edge or screw up our fitness but especially those of us who just want to finish you would be surprised at how well our bodies hold on to general fitness. You could take the last two weeks off completely and still have a surprisingly capable race. Be kind and gentle with yourself. Find your mantra. Stay injury free above all and let us know how it went!,ultrarunning,dfkahso,3,t5_2thxz
