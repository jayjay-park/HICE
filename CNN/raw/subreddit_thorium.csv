6506655,0,t1_czsb7mw,Liquid sodium has worse thermal properties.  Lower heat capacity and lower max temp then molten salts.  Weve built a number of sodium cooled reactors and most have had coolant problems.  Im sure a modern fast reactor could fix those issues.  However they have a bad history to deal with.Molten salt reactors can also operate in the fast spectrum.  Switch from flouride to chloride salts.  Moltex Energy and Terrapower have been investigating this route.  Chloride reactors bring a giant list of pros and cons.  The biggest con is that they are far less researched than flouride salts.,thorium,czsc5gw,1,t5_2rg7v
