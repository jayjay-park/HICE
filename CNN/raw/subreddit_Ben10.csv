2066335,0,t1_cl2f1tq,There are  seasons but only  episodes per season. You could easily breeze through them if you wanted. In my opinion there really isnt a must watch season at least not until you catch up to the current season. It was a spectacular opening.,Ben10,cl2h6i8,3,t5_2ub0g
3191644,0,t1_cmci2lg,I like the second and third options the best. The second because I really want to see that roadtrip now especially since Kevin and Gwen would be appearing a lot more.The third because I think they could do more with Ken  than Ben   I think by the time Ben is Ben  he shouldnt be making enough mistakesshould be too powerful to make a really interesting series about. With Kenny on the other hand they could do a heck of a lot  all the time traveling stuff with Chrono spanner he could get into a lot of trouble by fighting on his own etc. ,Ben10,costb0t,1,t5_2ub0g
6473359,0,t3_446lq3,Jeez what happened to Stinkfly and Wildvine?Except for the way too simple artstyle it doesnt seem too bad although I would prefer it to look like the original series or AFUA,Ben10,czow32x,1,t5_2ub0g
6945573,0,t3_4atx7z,I think you very well may have! Haha. The one on the right with your body and Bens face has two mouths. So maybe well call it Swap Chomp?,Ben10,d13m0bb,3,t5_2ub0g
7233167,0,t3_4c24f7,I dont remember him killing anyone but Ben has never had a problem with doing so. Hes threatened to a bunch in UA. I feel like hes crossed that line at least once just because of how many times he said he would.,Ben10,d20cwoq,1,t5_2ub0g

7722155,0,t1_d3hu187,Yeah Ill try to hold my judgment till I see it. Im hoping itll be a good show but with the animation change itll still be different. I think Id rather them do something similar but different the way avatar did it with legend of Korra  same idea same universe but rather different from the original show. ,Ben10,d3jyfj2,1,t5_2ub0g

8050834,0,t1_d4kqz5d,Yeah Cartoon Networks recent history doesnt favor the Ben  reboot at all here.,Ben10,d4kzmgz,3,t5_2ub0g
8139478,0,t1_d4tkdab,Just finished Little Moments and wow. By the end of it I couldnt even tell if it was approaching incest just kids play them realizing theyre the best friends theyve got andor a mix of feelings if you know what I mean. And Grandpa Maxs reaction at the end was surprising.Edit On Breaking Point Chapter  and definitely approaching incest.,Ben10,d4uzaza,1,t5_2ub0g
8370005,0,t3_4u1dcq,Why has Cartoon Network decided to ruin this series? I honestly loved it so much as a kid it was like my Harry Potter everything about it was just awesome and unique and now its become some lame cheap Saturday morning cartoon. I just wish they had decided to make a Ben  series at some point. I see no reason for this. ,Ben10,d5nsu68,5,t5_2ub0g

9051419,0,t1_d7ztz5i,Well I suppose having a negative outlook will only make you all the more pleased if it does indeed turn out to be good. As for me Im keeping as much of an open mind as I can.And I really dont think its fair to criticize so early but you do have a right to make your assumptions as much as I have the right to criticize the assumptions youre making.,Ben10,d7zu4gb,3,t5_2ub0g
9081572,0,t3_54nohm,Idk. While I worry about the show Im not completely down on the show before it even airs. I hope it is good. Honestly already got use to the art style other than the make every alien human shaped like stinkfly.  ,Ben10,d83gh8q,2,t5_2ub0g
10161960,0,t1_d9i12sm,The Ben  reboot was intentionally made to piss us off,Ben10,dbvwxn9,1,t5_2ub0g
10236831,0,t3_5kxns2,In my mindThe episode Goodbye and Good Riddance from Original Series is the intended canon ending with Bens secret identity being exposed when he was  years old.Alien Force  Ultimate Alien  Omniverse are set in Alternate Universes in which the events from Original Series happened in slightly different ways explaining all the retcons they did.And the Reboot is set in another Alternate Universe.,Ben10,dc4eh91,1,t5_2ub0g
