946485,0,t3_24wzjz,New Britain Museum of American Art is cool and cheap and they have the Museum After Dark event on May th. Ive been to a couple of those and theyre always fun.Theres a lot of great restaurants in and around Hartford and if you wanna do some window shopping or real shopping Blue Black Square in West Hartford is close and cool and also has many bars and restaurants as well.Theres enough stuff around here to keep you busy for a few hours a day without costing too much especially now that its nice out. If youre into exercising Id also recommend a walk or run around the West Hartford reservoir its one of my favorite places to just go run for a few hours. ,Hartford,chbvehy,3,t5_2rrtf
1338021,0,t3_27o87h,I also suggest the temp role. They pretty much do the job finding for you and should be able to locate something withing your school schedule and abilities. It might take a placement or two but usually there can be a good chance for getting a permanent job somewhere. It took me two placements and about a year of being a temp before I was officially hired. Half my department was hired in similar fashion anywhere from  weeks in to  years. Anxiety is a bitch but having someone from the temp agency be there to talk you through any questions can be helpful. Good luck,Hartford,cik562g,1,t5_2rrtf

Obviously the city cant speak for itself but it is shown and we tour the city in ways other films havent done.Youll be able to pick out a number of locations just by watching the trailer.,Hartford,cjvurrk,2,t5_2rrtf
1923147,0,t1_ckkuzbb,No property tax only which includes your car.  Sales tax I think is by county but is really the same all over income tax is state level.For reference on the car taxes I paid  a year for a  Honda CRV when I lived in glastonbury and havent updated my license yet to say Hartford because I dont want to pay hartford rates on it which I think would be double.,Hartford,ckkxbzz,1,t5_2rrtf
2534073,0,t1_cmp9pu3,Exactly. I prefer local businesses and dont want another drivethru because I feel that it makes the neighborhood less pedestrianfriendly but Id rather have people argue for what they want than see property development done without community input.,Hartford,cmpc8og,3,t5_2rrtf

3536779,0,t3_30r927,Your price point may be too low. There are a lot of multi family houses north of Farmington Ave which are reasonably close and not too bad of places. You could rent one of the floors in one of those. But you may have to pay more. Once you get a couple  yards north of Farmington it gets better pretty quick. But a lot will depend on just how comfortable you are with living in such an area. Theyll all have their own parking and each will be different in what else it offers so youll have to look at them. ,Hartford,cpveys4,2,t5_2rrtf
