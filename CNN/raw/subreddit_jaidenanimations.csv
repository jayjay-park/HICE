11498030,0,t1_dfxhwrh,It wasnt just Alex I dont want to point fingers because they may have had Jaidens permission but iHasCupquake also uploaded a vidcon vlog that showed Js face so I dont think we should be so quick to lay blame as of yet. Either one of them may have had permission or neither Im not sure I think we should wait until more information is available before we say these things. Also even if we are provided with solid evidence eg public apology I dont think we should attempt to damage their career or take action in any way. This is a matter that will be settled between the involved parties and I dont think a mob mentality is going to achieve anything. Remeber be nice and thing WWJD? Just to confirm the J stands for Jaiden we dont need anyone busting into churches and flipping tables ,jaidenanimations,dfzauy7,7,t5_3f3j1
