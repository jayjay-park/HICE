1408043,0,t3_2a62xv,This is horseshit. You are going off of bad opinions while you apparently live in a tiny town with one shop. Dont learn how to tattoo on YouTube move to a different city and apprentice. You arent above anybody else stop acting like you deserve a break because you want it that badly and everyone else is wrong even though they are the professionals and I am literally a selftaught scratcher learning the trade through a fuckin screen. ,sticknpokes,ciss0br,4,t5_2tgkm

2715917,0,t3_2r6013,C  size of barrel outer diameterER  collet sizeL  length in mmShipping took two weeks to the central USA.Once i clipped the loop off the needle bar it fit easily.  Some of these on ebay dont come with the special wrench but it isnt necessary for our purposes.  I chose this specific one because the diameter of the barrel was similar to the locknut.  I am especially interested in this tool because with the right collets I think it might be able to choke way up on the needles and grip the cluster itself on some types.  In the picture it is only holding the bar of a RL.  Collets come in a range of sizes that can be bought individually but the adjustment of each is very narrow.  For example I bought a  collet and it cant even grab a rl cluster without wrapping the solder part with foil or tape. The cluster is too thin.Unfortunately it is made of carbon steel so you must take care to store and use it in low humidity environments.  However this is actually advantageous for reasons I will post about soon ,sticknpokes,cncsewt,2,t5_2tgkm
