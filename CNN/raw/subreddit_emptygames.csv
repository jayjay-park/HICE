4813910,0,t1_cu1bq9g,RTS isnt doing well as a whole. People are scared to play v but have no anxiety it seems when playing team games like MOBAs. Ti prize pool was insanely large. LoL has quite a bit of money involved and a massive playerbase. Millions if I remember correctly. Starcraft  on the other hand has less than  ranked v players and all you have to do to get ranked is play  game if you have been ranked before and if you havent been ranked before all you have to do is play  games. I made this post to try and attract new players or bring back old players.,emptygames,cu1c0g5,1,t5_2zhla
