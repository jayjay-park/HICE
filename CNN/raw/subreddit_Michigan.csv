I was on a city council complaining to Granholm and our local legislator when those cuts were being made as well.And your second statement makes no sense at all.

292563,1,t1_cfb171c,gt The economic recovery is one of the slowest in the nation and being  in job growth reflects that. Nothing in his policies can be attributed to any growth. Thats not really Snyder though. We were in the worst recession of the entire nation. We lost more people than every other state. We were the first first into a recession and many economists predict we will be the last out and the earliest we could see true signs of recovery wont be until . But we could very well end up spending this entire decade in recovery. Thats not a fault of Snyder. Thats what happens when you are in the worst recession its going to take time to get out of it. And of course you arent really seeing many bills passed. What you see are bills trying to spur job growth in certain areas. However any policies put in place will take years to see results from. gt I dont know if he actually tried to prevent bankruptcy or how that will turn out at this time. Ill reserve judgement until its all done. He did try. That was the point of an EFM. But it was done way too late to really help anything. gt passing a draconian abortion bill during the lame duckThat wasnt Snyder. The legislature went over Snyders head in this case. Even Snyder opposed the bill. gt Increasing taxes in my tax bracketThats akin to the he kicked my puppy argument. Again we lost more people. If we want out of this recession money has to come from somewhere.gt passing right to workAgain this is one of the he kicked my puppy arguments. Contrary to the propaganda about whats wrong with right to work I think its a step in the right direction.gt signing an unconstitutional law to prevent GSRAs from organizingThinking through the logic of the bill it makes sense. A GSRA is not an employee they are students. gt taxing senior pensionsAfter reading through all the propaganda on this it actually makes sense. And its not all seniors as you might believe. Its tiered and it basically makes everyone contribute to the services provided. I think its more fair. Current seniors are not affected. It just affects future generations. gt cuts to K and the EAA failures with reports of child abuse. I do dislike cuts to education in general. However Im willing to overlook them sometimes. gt I never said he kicked my puppy.Never said he did. Im saying that the arguments for hating him you put forth arent really any reason why hes a horrible governor. Hes a governor that you cant really put labels on.

300431,0,t1_cfbtwcz,Ok fair enough.  Those  workers have a  raise.  Lets say their employer was a grocery store company.  The grocery store company has to charge more for food to make up for their employees costing them more.  When they do the landlord of those employees has to spend more on food and pay his employees more so he decides to charge more in rent to make up for it.  The guy at the gas station who also has to pay his employees more also has increased rent and food costs so he charges more for gas.  So after they get their  raise they now have to pay more in food gas and rent costs.This is of course all very simplified but this is why a minimum wage increase doesnt just magically make everyones life better.

There used to be a live alligator in that part of the store. Spicys just down the road from Lunkers has been my dads go to breakfast spot for decades. Its a little hole in the wall place where everyone knows each other. Youll probably want to hit up Martins in Granger for groceries. I dont believe Edwardsburg has a grocery store anymore after the Hardings closed.If youre looking for a little more excitement the University Park Mall is only about  minutes away in Mishawaka. Youre also about  minutes from Notre Dame. Niles MI is nearby as well. They have a pretty good selection of restaurants and shops. I highly recommend Venis Chocolates and Pizza Transit both right in downtown Niles. Wonderland Cinema in Niles is also the cheapest place in the area for movies besides the dollar theater in Mishawaka. Also just one county west is Lake Michigan.

1927698,0,t1_cklbkuf,gtIt seems to me that under the current structure once law enforcement has taken possession they have  days to investigate and charge before returning assets to the owners possession. The change allows for law enforcement to have  days. days to investigate and charge would certainly make a lot more sense than just to give notice.Actually Ive done some more googling and learned that notice of forfeiture is a specific legal term meaning the name of the notice that is given to property owners to appear in court to say why the property shouldnt be forfeited source Heres more info from the Forfeiture Endangers American Rights Foundation. So it sounds like law enforcement has  days before the suspect can start the process of asking for their property back.I dont know why I took such an interest in this. Of course Im  in favor of cracking down on human trafficking but this was the first time Ive heard of forfeiture and I was taken aback that law enforcement can actually do it and now were even quadrupling the time they can hold it with no say from the property owner.,Michigan,cklh23y,1,t5_2qhtl

3101740,0,t1_cojhr92,ampampamp White privilege sfw gtWhite privilege or white skin privilege is a term for societal privileges that benefit white people in western countries beyond what is commonly experienced by the nonwhite people under the same social political or economic circumstances.  These privileges are unearned and are distributed based on values of the dominant group which in the west is white people.  According to McIntosh and Lee whites in a society considered culturally a part of the Western World enjoy advantages that nonwhites do not experience.  This leads to the controversy over whether or not White people should be able to enjoy these privileges. The term denotes both obvious and less obvious passive advantages that white persons may not recognize they have which distinguishes it from overt bias or prejudice.  These include cultural affirmations of ones own worth presumed greater social status and freedom to move buy work play and speak freely.  The effects can be seen in professional educational and personal contexts.  The concept of white privilege also implies the right to assume the universality of ones own experiences marking others as different or exceptional while perceiving oneself as normal.  gtgtImage iInteresting Peggy McIntosh | Whiteness studies | Privilge du blanc | Tim Wise Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcojhsn oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecojhsn.

I actually believed the latter was true until I encountered the following AG opiniongtBecause the exemption contained in section aa is limited to officers who are regularly employed an unpaid volunteer officer is not exempt from the provisions of the Concealed Pistol Licensing Act and is therefore prohibited from carrying a concealed pistol in a designated gun free zone.

6878956,0,t3_49ys1o,Sigh... Because people dont read. First off the under Michigan law a law enacted in  under governor William Milliken the state governors office and legislature are immune from FOIA. The FOIA thusly doesnt apply so releasing ANYTHING is already more than FOIA exemptions. Secondly there was atleast an attempt to comply with FOIA rules. Its hard to blame them for trying. We should be happy theyre releasing as much as they are without being required to by court order.gt Were redacting things that are not relevant to Flint to the Flint water crisis. And then we in addition are redacting anything that would be redacted under FOIA said Snyder spokesperson Ari Adler.Thirdly the only mistake the article talks about was an error as stated by Snyders own office representative and gives the details right in the article what the redaction actually is. This articles content has already been fixed and thus there was no point to publish other than partisan politics.gt Adler said that particular redaction was in error and that item b. reads Brita water filters donated by MeijerClorox.Finally Yes the state legislature and governors office SHOULDNT be exempt from FOIA but they are.

Its located on a bluff about a  mile from the Lake and has breath taking views on a clear day.  Foods really yummy and the drive there is another reason to go.  Roads are winding and hilly and make for a lovely drive especially in a stick shift sporty car with great views of the country side and Lake Michigan.

7663107,0,t1_d3advyk,For anyone who is confused by this.  Like I was...I dug in to check it out... gt Employees of hospitals and residential care establishments that have agreements with the employees that they will work day periods in lieu of day workweeks if the employees are paid overtime premium pay within the requirements of the Act for all hours worked over eight in a day or  in the day work period whichever is the greater number of overtime hoursSo basically you have to agree that youre working  day periods. and In return if your Daily OT total is greater than your  day over  total you get whichever is more.  So basically if you work five  hour daysyouve got  Hours in the daily bucket.  If you work  more  hour days  for  hours and then they cut your hours to try and compensate...You get paid  of your hours as OT because that per day total is greater than your entire period total over .     Even though you worked  hours in your  day period the individual days over  hours have to be paid with OT.  the system for hospital workers is actually better especially for hospital workers who work double or triple shifts with long periods off after long periods on.So people in the Hospital industry being told that if they only worked  hours in  weeks they dont get any OT even if most of their days were extended days are probably getting shafted illegally IF im interpreting the rules correctly.,Michigan,d3d92hj,1,t5_2qhtl

10862386,0,t3_5v9wsz,PresidentDonald Trumps constant fearmongering about terrorism is irresponsible and dangerous. He needs to stop attacking the legitimacy of the judiciary. He picked an attorney general with antiliberty positions on surveillance and police seizure of property.Those tough assessments come not from one of the presidents critics in the Democratic Party but from a conservative Republican House member whose district decisively backed Mr. Trump in the election.Rep.Justin Amashof Michigan has emerged as one of the leading Republican critics of the president using a tool Mr. Trump himself often employsan assertive presence onTwitterto challenge and even taunt the president. While other House Republicans who were skeptical of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign have since toned down their criticism Mr. Amash who has  Twitter followers has remained a vocal critic.Mr. Amash says his opposition is based on principle as a libertarian concerned about government overreach and adherence to the Constitution. While many Republican lawmakers hold similar beliefs Mr. Amash has been an especially outspoken proponent of smaller government even on issuessuch as reducing surveillancewhere his views put him out of step with the more mainstream elements of the GOP.To me it doesnt matter whether its a Republican in the White House or a Democrat in the White House. I have a duty to defend liberty defend the rule of law and protect the rights of all of my constituents said Mr. Amash.The White House didnt respond to questions about Mr. Amashs Twitter posts or his views of the president.Though he counts a large share of Trump voters among his constituents Mr. Amash says he has little fear of speaking out.Elected in  as part of the tea party wave he won reelection last year in his Grand Rapidsarea district by about  percentage points. Mr. Trump saw much narrower support in the district which he won by  percentage points according to results compiled by the liberal website Daily Kos. Official election results by congressional district arent available from the state of Michigan.During the GOP presidential primaries Mr. Amash supported Sen.Rand Paulof Kentucky and then Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. After the release of audio that revealed Mr. Trump making lewd comments about women Mr. Amash called for him to drop out of the race though he said he wouldnt vote forHillary Clintoneither.Mr. Amashs continued criticism of Mr. Trump has at times put him at odds with party leaders such as House SpeakerPaul Ryanof Wisconsin who have taken on the delicate task ofrecasting some of Mr. Trumps commentsto make them more consistent with mainstream Republican thinking.Lately our leadership team seems to be going along with the president regardless of the situation Mr. Amash said. Its possible that over time the leadership team will recognize that things are getting out of hand and will try to restrain the president.When Mr. Trump suspended immigration from seven Muslimmajority nations out of concerns about terrorism Mr. Amash responded with a tweetstorm in which he called the executive order illegal. Immigrants with green cards he said cannot legally be banned on the basis of their nationality or place of birth. Mr. Trumps order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system Mr. Amash wrote at the time.After the travel ban caused chaos at airports the administration said the order didnt ban green card holders from entering the country.A draft of the revised rule makes this clear.Mr. Amash acknowledged that a president has wide latitude to ban refugees though not greencard holders. But he called Mr. Trumps ban on refugees from certain countries harsh and unwise and said wellvetted refugees should be admitted.When Mr. Trump attacked the federal judges who put his immigration order on hold Mr. Amash counseled the president to stop attacking the legitimacy of the judiciary.Mr. Trump has said his immigration policies are needed for national security and that judges are overstepping their role by hindering him.The son of a Palestinian refugee father and a Syrian immigrant mother Mr. Amash says his ideals come from a deep love of country instilled by his immigrant parents. When his father dropped him off at school every morning hed tell him he could do anything in the U.S. Its with that perspective that he objects to the immigration ban.Most immigrants come here to make a better life and they want to assimilate and be a part of our nation said Mr. Amash who was born in Grand Rapids. I think we need to remain a country that is welcoming to those immigrants. If my dads family didnt have the generosity of Americans to bring him here then I wouldnt be sitting right here in Congress.Mr. Amash says he supports congressional investigations into alleged communications between Mr. Trumps campaign and Russian operatives and on Friday requested an immediate briefing from Attorney General Jeff Sessions director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey and Michael Dempsey the acting Director of National Intelligence. He posted the letter to Twitter.,Michigan,de0dmua,2,t5_2qhtl
