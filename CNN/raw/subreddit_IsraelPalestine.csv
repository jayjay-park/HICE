5403900,0,t3_3p1ndx,gt They are not at all the same thing. The simple fact is that none of pre Palestine was under the political authority of Arabs or Jews. It was ruled by the British Mandatory government established by the League of Nations for the express purpose of creating a Jewish National Home. It was alsocontrary to the claims of innumerable proPalestinian activiststhe first time a discrete political entity called Palestine existed in modern history. And this entity was established in order to fulfill a goal that was essentially Zionist in nature.Well it wasnt under the political authority of the Arabs because the British subjugated them.  If the British had adhered to their promises in the HusseinMcmahon conference the Arabs would have had authority over the land and the issue would have been moot.  The British betrayed the Arabs.  The League of Nations was nothing more than a victors club from WW and there was nothing moral or right about the mandate system.  I also find it noteworthy that the author doesnt mention this proviso placed right after the Jewish national home part of the mandate.gt  it being clearly understood that nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing nonJewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.The civil rights of every Arab whose home was allocated to the Jewish state was violated. They did not vote to belong to a Jewish state. gt As seen above  has exactly zero land under Palestinian Arab controlnot autonomous not sovereign not anythingas it was all under British authority. The argument is not about control.  It is about the rights of the native people of the land not Jews from Poland and Russia.  Palestine did not belong to the British any more than India or Nigeria or Kenya or any of their colonial properties.  The British ruled the land through violence and not through any kind of agreement or volition of the natives.  The British owned Palestine the same way Nazi Germany owned Poland and all the Jewish property in it.  Why is it that the third panel of maps doesnt show the British White Paper proposal of  where they suggest the creation of a Palestinian state and reject a Jewish state?  Zionists certainly rejected that partition proposal.gt But territorial maximalists on the Israeli side are not wrong when they use the same standards to claim that they have given up  percent of what was promised to them including Transjordan.Well the British shouldnt have been making promises at all.  The idea that Zionists would want the other side of the Jordan river too just shows how completely colonial their mindset is and was.  How many Zionists lived in Amman?The land in Palestine belonged to the residents of Palestine.  Not some British lords.  Not some Russian or Polish Jews who had immigrated in the s.  Any kind of justification for why the Arabs of Palestine should have just allowed the British and the Zionists to carve up the land for themselves is just a justification for colonialism. ,IsraelPalestine,cw2epo3,9,t5_2sgz7

5587773,0,t3_3rk83w,The weird part of this question is that it calls for the comparison of two subjective issues in tandem.If we just look at the first part  What countries have faced threats comparable to those faced by Israel then the answers are broad and numerous.That is because while Israel sees itself as facing serious threats in reality it is extremely secure.  Seen objectively Israel faces threats comparable with those faced by Canada the United States or Mexico.And thats just in North America.I base that conclusion on the fact that the actual threats facing Israel are small.  There is a risk of individuals facing violence but no real risk to the state itself from violence.The only real threats the country faces as a whole is that there may be a change in the government through elections or that outside pressure may force changes in governmental policy.  The purportedly existential threats faced by Israel are not real significant threats.Sure it is conceivable that Iran may develop then launch nuclear weapons at Israel which Israel would respond to with overwhelming force which would destroy Iran just like it is conceivable that Russia may launch nukes at the US although Russia actually has those weapons in response to which the US would destroy Russia.The threats exist but they arent real because they are so farfetched and unlikely that they can be essentially ignored.Given the low level of threat that Israel actually faces I would have to say that there are dozens and dozens of countries that face comparable threats and have better human rights records.  Running from the West coast of Europe eastward that would include but is not limited toIreland the UK Portugal Spain France Norway Denmark Sweden Holland Belgium Germany...  and the list goes on and on.,IsraelPalestine,cwpprfw,4,t5_2sgz7

5667262,0,t1_cwzkdn4,In Palestine I think there is an intergenerational gap in terms of religiosity. Sure young people might say theyre Muslim or Christian but in my experience a lot of people are saying that for family or cultural reasons much more than because of theological reasons.The State of Palestine is also quite religious. In fact the basic laws of Palestine hold that the legal system is based on Sharia. This is of course a big problem but its one that civil society unfortunately cant address because the State of Palestine is being colonized by foreign colonialists who are protected by an offensive foreign military. Worrying about the occupation and about settlements is a precursor to secularizing the State of Palestine.Think about it this way if the U.S. were being occupied by the Chinese military do you think people in the U.S. would spend a lot of time worrying about things like samesex marriage or about Christian fundamentalism when the very survival of the Administrative State is under attack?As for the religiosity of Israelis my impression is that it also depends. In terms of the motivations for their occupation of Palestine I think they can be driven as much by economic considerations as they can by religious fanaticism. A lot of Israels Jewish population  such as the black population  is socially marginalized for racial reasons. This is why I think Israel is fundamentally an ethnocratic rather than a theocratic State. Whenever you hear Israel described as a Jewish State its primarily an allusion to an ethnic dimension. While some members of this selfidentified ethnic group do also want to promote Israel as a religiously Jewish State Judaism in the religious sense seems also to be considered a cultural component of the Jewish ethnic group. This is why you hear people talk about Hebrew culture with Judaism being one possible or dominant component I suppose of that culture. This is also why it seems that this selfidentified ethnic group seems to view religious converts to Judaism who arent ethnically Jewish somewhat as outsiders. You can subscribe to the culturalreligious component of the selfidentified ethnic group but you can never  it seems  become truly Jewish if youre not ethnically Jewish. The result of this is that there seems to be a core group of people in Israel that selfidentify as Jewish ethnically and for whom religion may or may not matter so you hear of socalled secular Jews. Then you have converts to religious Judaism again which seems to be a possible or dominant component within ethnic Jewish culture who are outside of this core ethnic group but who are tolerated because theyve adopted a component of the culture of some of the members of the core ethnic group. For these nonethnically Jewish people in particular religion is much more important because it is the only means of proving that theyve adopted the culture of the core ethnic group. This also seems to be why so many EuropeanIsraelis are very concerned with establishing their ethnic Jewishness rather than being satisfied with just a religious connection as this would put them into the core ethnic group without having to prove their Jewishness or adoption of JewishHebrew culture through religiosity.,IsraelPalestine,cwzkv6m,5,t5_2sgz7

By which I mean are they really a timid version of a much more forthright sentiment that cannot be said at the moment?FWIW I have no doubt that settlement growth raises questions about Israels long term objectives. I dont think that is even a proPalestinian view as such. It is a view I think Yitzhak Rabin and the old Israeli hafrada school of two state politicians would also have held.But I also think we are at or past the tipping point those same men warned of  the point at which settlements cant or wont be dismantled and any future solution cant or wont be based around a viable two state deal. I dont see the paradigm shift in Israeli politics happening soon. As such settlement growth and territorial expansion will likely continue and with it a greater threat to the two state solution that the US is wedded to supporting.Within the State Department there must be serious conversations and scenario planning around what the future relationship between the two countries will be. At the moment nobody seems  publicly at least  to look beyond the U.S. will always stay Israels partner but it is not inconceivable to imagine a scenario of regime change in several countries in the Middle East at some point coupled with greater difficulty lending unequivocal US support to a hard right Israeli government with more punitivediscriminatory policies towards Palestinians.,IsraelPalestine,cxyiy46,3,t5_2sgz7

6022563,0,t1_cy90d6j,Here is the relevant parts of itgt no statute relates to the right to equality for the Arab minority in particular. The Basic Law Human Dignity and Liberty which is considered a minibill of rights by Israeli legal scholars does not enumerate a right to equality on the contrary this Basic Law emphasizes the character of the state as a Jewish state.Basically It doesnt mention Arabs specifically so it doesnt count. I couldnt disagree more. I think making the right of human dignity and liberty defined as widely as possible only enforce the fact Israel is a democracy.gt In July  the United Nations Human Rights Committee which monitors the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or ICCPR expressed its concern that Israels Basic Law Human Dignity and Liberty does not contain a general provision for equality and nondiscrimination and called on Israel to amend its Basic Laws and other legislation to include the principle of nondiscrimination and ensure that allegations of discrimination brought before its domestic courts are promptly addressed and implemented.Again nothing against Arabs specifically.. The UN seemed to be bothered by that laws that mention human dignity and equality arent emphasized rather than laws that are.gt this fundamental right is currently protected by judicial interpretation alone. However the fundamental importance of the principle of equality requires that it be explicitly guaranteed in the Basic Laws or a written constitution. The absence of an explicit guarantee of the right to equality in the Basic Laws or ordinary statutes diminishes the power of this right and leaves the Palestinian minority in Israel vulnerable to direct and indirect discrimination. The current constitutional situation has allowed the State of Israel to enact laws that are either discriminatory on their face in that they relate only to the rights of Jews in Israel or abridge the rights of Arab citizens of the state or use neutral language and general terminology but have a discriminatory effect on Arab citizens. Adalah has identified more than  main laws that discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel. This list of laws includes only primary legislation and is not exhaustive indeed since the election of the Netanyahu administration in February  members of the government coalition have introduced a raft of discriminatory legislative proposals that are currently at different stages in their passage through the Knesset.Same as I said before. Il add that The official stance of Israel is that everyone is entitled to have the same rights as citizens in Israel.gt The Law of Return  and The Citizenship Law allow Jews to immigrate freely to Israel and to gain citizenship but exclude Arabs who were forced to flee their homes in  and . The right to migrant is not a democratic right. Many countries chose who may allow to migrant to them base on similar laws and they are all democratic.gt The Chief Rabbinate of Israel Law How is that one not democratic? should Israel decide on a Chief Muslim religious leadership? I dont think it would be seen in well by the rest of the world apart of that there are laws that specifically allow freedom of religion.gt The Flag and Emblem Law That one is connected to the very character of the state. Apart of other democratic states having the same laws like France Canada and England It does not exclude or discriminate anyone unless the very existence of an ethnic base state is somehow discriminating people which again I disagree with.gt and The State Education Law  and its  amendment give recognition to Jewish educational religious and cultural practices and institutions and define their aims and objectives strictly in Jewish terms while no similar laws providing similar legal recognition to the religious and cultural rights of the Palestinian minority in Israel have been legislated.This is what I found about itgt The State Education Law  stipulates that education will be provided as a rule by the State on the basis of an educational program that is supervised and approved by the Ministry of Education. The law recognizes two streams of education State education and State religious education. The law also sanctions nongovernment education institutions recognized but not official institutions that are supervised by the Ministry of Education and independent institutions that are not supervised by the Ministry. Although parents have the right to choose the stream of education which their children will attend they are not allowed to choose the specific school their children will attend. The local school board refers children to schools in accordance with the policy of social integration.Seems democratic to me. Includes both Jewish and none Jewish education SourceIf you mean that Israel should create more laws related and supportive of the minority population I agree but these laws being few has nothing to do with the Jewish character of the state or intentional discrimination or exclusion of Arabs.,IsraelPalestine,cy92xe8,0,t5_2sgz7

So we agree.Well I corrected your language which was imprecise but yes.gtOkay so youre telling me that the only way to ensure Israels security is to violate human rights of millions of Palestinians whether they are innocent or not is that correct? Why not Israel comply with humanitarian law?Israel does comply with humanitarian law it is Palestinians who do not by refusing to end the war of aggression and by supporting in the majority the use of terrorism.The only way to ensure Israels security is to continue the selfdefensive occupation that began in the West Bank in  and began because of the illegal and aggressive Palestinian and Jordanian attack on Israels rear as it fought Egypt.gtDo you believe this is the best method to promote peace?The best method to promote peace is not to allow Palestine to use independence to destroy Israel and kill its civilians. When the right to selfdetermination comes into conflict with the right to life the right to life is clearly more important. The solution is not to appease those who seek to use terrorism to destroy Israel by forcing a withdrawal and then destroying it in full as Palestinians support but to end Palestinian support so Israel can withdraw bitbybit.gt Moreover if security is the issue why is there a need for colonialism and the governments support for a radical growing settlermovement?Settlers are not all radical and you are smearing a group of people. There is no need for the building of homes in occupied or disputed territory. But that is irrelevant to the overarching conflict which revolves around the Palestinianmajoritys denial of Israels right to exist.Settlements may provide a useful propaganda point but they are not the root for a conflict that precedes them and is not centered on them.gt Particularly when the greatest security issue are the illegal settlements?The homes are not the greatest security issue by any means. Settlements are as easy to defend in many cases as Israeli cities are so long as border control is consistent between them. It is. The fence encompasses many of the attacked Israeli civilians and their homes especially around Jerusalem.The greatest security issue is Palestinian support for war crimes and terrorism.gtWouldnt the settlements not be in Israels interest if her interest is to maintain security?Building homes is not contrary to the interest of maintaining security at all. Perhaps building homes in some isolated areas might be but Israel has offered to remove them should the need arise in exchange for peace.The building of settlements or nonbuilding of them would not end violence against Israeli civilians in any capacity. At best it makes it more possible in some isolated areas but there is no study backing that up. Many of these attacks are in areas Israel has annexed and treated as its own like East Jerusalem meaning the problem is not where the settlements are but rather the Palestinian choice to target them.As I said before terrorists are conscious about perception. Jibril Rajoub the Palestinian official in Fatah has admitted as much. I will quote it again for yougt For the international community it is unacceptable for a bus to explode in Tel Aviv but it does not care what happens to a settler or a soldier who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time in the occupied land. Therefore we must fight in a manner that keeps the world on our side. I believe that there is a consensus about this.If robbed of the ability to attack civilians in the West Bank or East Jerusalem Palestinians will simply target another area. Instead of appeasing terrorism we should end the fundamental support for it in Palestinian civil society that encourages over  of Palestinians to support the murder of Israeli civilians inside Israel not in settlements.Palestinians unequivocally cite as I said anything but the location of Israelis as the reason why they are not all participating in the attacks. What is deterring them the vast majority say is fear of reprisals and failure. That means the occupation is effective at stopping attacks.Only  percent of Palestinians say there is little participation in attacks because they cannot reach Israelis. That is not their problem and would never be their problem their reason for not killing Israeli civilians is fear. In that regard the occupation has served its goal of defending civilians. If Palestinians choose to stop supporting terrorism then fear of failure or death or arrest for terrorism will leave the table and Palestinians will see an end to occupation.,IsraelPalestine,cylcjgn,-1,t5_2sgz7

One is an unrepentant bigot who cars only about her own power and the other is an idiot who care only about his own power.gt and you give too much credit to AIPAC they cant control what the parties do just try to influence...I didnt say AIPAC controls what parties do.  One of the things AIPAC is really good at though is lobbying.  The drafting of the party platforms is one of the biggest opportunities to flex that muscle and by focusing only on a single issue AIPAC has been very successful in influencing the language of those documents in the past.This year is a little different than usual however for two major reasons.  One AIPAC has had much less influence over the language of the Democratic Partys platform than usual because a newer group JStreet has eclipsed it with many members not all maybe not a majority but a significant number and is exercising its influence on the platform.Now given that JStreet is a hardcore Zionist group with the same goals and influences as AIPAC just with a new younger face that influence has resulted in an insultingly racist and antirights Democratic Party Platform even calling for restrictions on free speech rights in regard to Israel.The second reason is that the grass roots of the Democratic Party is no longer blindly supporting the Israeli government right or wrong but instead there is a significant percentage that has a rightsoriented position seeking to protect both Israelis and Palestinians which conflicts with the position of the entrenched leadership like Hillary who couldnt care less if Israel killed every Palestinian on Earth.The JStreet designed Democratic Party Platform may prove to be a last hurrah for hateful bigots and racists in that party  maybe  but with AIPAC holding less than its normal influence with the Democrats while still having a stranglehold on the debate in the GoP coupled with a generational sea change on the left...Maybe AIPAC is simply trying to get ahead of the upcoming breakdown of uniform American support for every action of the Israeli government by staking an extreme position with the GoP so it can contrast itself with what is for all intents and purposes an identical lobby group JStreet.,IsraelPalestine,d5azoq3,5,t5_2sgz7

8955820,0,t3_52w4dc,I think that on the Palestinian side Abbas knows that he needs to maintain the support of and minimize the open hostility from the Palestinian people during negotiations and the deal he signs if he is the one that signs it needs be fulfill all the requirements that would allow it to be accepted or tolerated by the majority of Palestinian society. This means that he doesnt have the luxury of making gestures like recognizing Israel as a Jewish state and publicly renouncing the right of return even if he personally would be willing to make these compromises. Of either of these things occurs he will only be able to do them as part of a final deal not as a prenegotiation gesture and it will need to be presented to the Palestinian people in a very different way from how it will be portrayed to the Israeli public.On the Israeli side I think that the major issue is more about Netanyahus motives rather than his political capacity to take action. I think that he doesnt really feel pressure to do anything to change the status quo and he is more concerned with maintaining a coalition that gives him the most personal power rather than formulating a coalition that would leave him weaker but more able to compromise to achieve a deal. He could have made a unity government with Herzog if he wanted to and he explored the possibility earlier before deciding against it and instead created the most right wing government in Israeli history.  This is why I blame Netanyahu more than Abbas because Abbas is structurally unable to compromise more than he has without destroying his government Netanyahu is very much capable of halting settlement expansion and making all the necessary concessions for peace. The support for doing so exists in the Israeli public and in the Knesset just not in his particular coalition that he put together by his own making.  ,IsraelPalestine,d7oct1y,4,t5_2sgz7

Does the political situation ever impact on your work or do you find the people you interact with from overseas keep their political and professional opinionsattitudes separate?This is very interesting to me because I have a strong interest in the regions affairs and am at times quite critical of Israeli policyactions surrounding the Occupation but I would never dream of mentioning even taking an interest to the Israelis I connect with via my work.
