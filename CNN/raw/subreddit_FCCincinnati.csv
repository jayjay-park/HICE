Its way WAY harder to build up enthusiasm for a game against what is essentially a glorified developmental squad for an MLS team. As has been said theres just SO much difference between the energy at an FCC match in front of  and a TwoRonto match in front of what appears to be less than .I just dont see how USL owners can rationalize investing longterm in a league that is half Serious independent squads taking it seriously and half B teams within the same City as the A team not drawing even  PeopleNothing about this says longterm stability.

10667430,0,t1_ddg95kz,I recommend DI just cause Im in it and it is awesome. But you really cant mess this up. What I really recommend is that you try some pregame  away games out and see what suits your style. Each group has a different experience and dynamic but in the end we all form together and march into that stadium united.  ,FCCincinnati,ddg9j27,9,t5_3994g

Late score stoppage time? player who scored goal ran to press box sideline started screaming at fans many were children who line the first row since tickets arent sold there. Just wasnt a good look.

10990744,0,t1_dedrccj,We arent being run to make money right now either. I agree with ufccincy up until the part about winning and increases in attendance. Tampa is flexing ownership strength. Onfield and attendance are nice but a strong front office and ownership group in a good TV market are the biggest factors as we know. This is purely a headline grabbing move aimed at looking like an ownership groupfront office to be taken seriously. Just look at Sacramento. The USL club attachment while important from the citys perspective was probably the least important aspect of the MLS bid. Whether Republic is on the MLS jersey or not doesnt matter as much as some other things in that bid. ,FCCincinnati,dedrl7e,5,t5_3994g

11287766,0,t1_dfbad00,Yeah I agree. Honestly my guess as to why theyre behind on everything is due to the MLS application and the effort to secure land and work out logistics for a SSS as well as plans for a training facility.

11675907,0,t3_66l3g8,I sat over there a few time last season. I stood a majority of the games and only had a few incidents of this happening. My opinion is stand if you want to. Just dont block small children or disabled people. I dont think there is a no standing policy by the club. So if those particular fans are unhappy they can sit in a different area of the section. And with the Bailey being sold out the legion is probably going to grow stronger this season anyway. ,FCCincinnati,dgjhb1s,8,t5_3994g
