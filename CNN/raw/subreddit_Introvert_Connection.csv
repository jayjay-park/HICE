1540800,0,t1_cj9elh3,Yeah there are definitely some obstacles to it. As far as the technicalities of actually watching it together we could either a Have people find it on their own but turn it on at the same time or b on Google Hangouts you can share your screen so I assume that someone could just bring it up on their computer and share it with everyone else.I dont know if its true that it wouldnt take off since no one has really provided feedback about whether theyd be interested. On the gender ratio Im not too worried since we arent devoted just to romantic relationships.Anyway Im not too wedded to the idea but if theres interest Id be more than happy to go further with it.,Introvert_Connection,cj9ewbf,1,t5_32qkt
