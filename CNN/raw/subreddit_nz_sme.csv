8527515,0,t3_4wfprl,Hey pws. Just asking in general if the social media marketing is working for sme. I think multi channel marketing in social is great. But your flavour has to fit the audience I.e. one content post may fit twitter may not fit fb or LinkedIn. I am a digital marketer so in general asking if sme owners have the time to post ads and content across the mediums effectively.,nz_sme,d67i42s,1,t5_30wll
