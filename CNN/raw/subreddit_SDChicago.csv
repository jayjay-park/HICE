4107520,0,t1_cro178z,I have no idea tbh. You might call or email them to ask for more details. Parking downtown is usually better on Sundays than other days of the week but I dont know anything specific about this place.,SDChicago,crohe0q,1,t5_33si3
4187011,0,t3_35fnol,The forecast right now looks like rain and storms Sunday afternoon. We make the call on weather at the time we start the tour or class. Predictions dont mean anything in Chicago so come prepared to paddle. If at the time we start the event there are any signs of severe weather we will then cancel and reschedule.  If we cancel due to weather you will have a rain check to reschedule for another date of your choice.If its obviously going to be storming in the afternoon Im not going to drive the  hours itll take for me to get there just so they can cancel it.ugingersprout whos in the group thats going?,SDChicago,crxir71,2,t5_33si3
