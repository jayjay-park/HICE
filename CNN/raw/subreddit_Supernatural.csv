35089,0,t3_1uhaxg,These spoilers are very misleading. Gadreel is ejected from Sam by the end of episode  so no Jared Padalecki will not be busy tackling any kind of issues that Gadreel might be having or trying to figure out if Sam is still in there during the second half of the season. In fact episode  has Sam and Castiel at the bunker together trying to figure out how to track down Gadreel by using some sort of leftover grace that was left inside Sam after Gadreel is ejected. Im thinking that Tahmoh Penikett will be reprising his role as Gadreel and Sam and Cas set off to try and find him at some point while Dean is off trying to track down Abaddon with Crowley.spoiler At least thats what I gleaned from some of the more recent spoilers that Ive read. ,Supernatural,ceifd1v,1,t5_2ql8e

Not too far out of the realms of possibility either  Im pretty sure it was indicated that Dean was almost turned when Cas pulled him out and with the amount of angels thatve possessed Sam hes probably subconsciously learnt how to work their mojo so just needs to suck some out of an unwitting angel.,Supernatural,ceq1mzu,13,t5_2ql8e

But I dont think that just any human can ingest demon blood and be able to do the same things Sam was able to do.

If we weigh the supernatural evils here we have a gift from Alistair and a gift from Lucifer. . . I really think that just taking the mark of Cain when we can very well deduce that Abbadon could be killed by Sams power seems a little ridiculous.

232850,0,t1_cf4vedg,That would be cool too! I love that idea. Im not sure if Id want them to just... suddenly be women though. I might like just some weird alternate universe situation where they just are women. Like no explaination no weird intro where it shows Sam and Dean becoming women there are just two acctresses playing Sam and Dean. I feel like that would be so delightful. I guess like that Adventure Time episode if I had to relate it to something. It would be cute.,Supernatural,cf4vtsj,7,t5_2ql8e
233509,0,t3_1wrxi0,To be fair in response to most other people saying Dean should have done let Sam go ahead and do it do you really think without the both of them the world would survive? I mean without both of them being around the world would fall to pieces from the angels falling from Heaven. Of course Dean stopped Sam before that happened but likely because he wanted to talk to Sam about it and he may very well have let him go along with it. However when the angels all fell Dean likely realised that theyd both be needed to help protect people again and get the angels back in Heaven. Maybe he thought that he wouldnt be able to do it alone and he needed Sams help.Either way my best guess is that if Sam HAD completed the trial hed have been obliterated as the sacrifice without any body that any angel could restore. Even with just two trials completed Sam had massive internal burns and bleeding. After three Id guess his body would be destroyed utterly. And after all in order to put his soul back into his body even if his body wasnt destroyed would require an angel going to Heaven and retrieving it. Guess what isnt possible after the Season  Finale? Yep. Only God could restore him and it wasnt likely that hed do that since it was an intended sacrifice.So while yeah it may have been a bit of lazy writing the characters personalities provide a bit more explanation as well as some critical thinking about the implications of the angels falling and what effect that would have on their willingness to sacrifice one of themselves. When it comes to Crowley... Turn him back into a human and he loses his power and lets face it at that point Abaddon was also a threat to them they needed at least one devil they knew to possibly back them with some power. Bad reason but that one was probably actually just sloppy writing and the writers desire to keep the favourite smartass demon king of Hell around.,Supernatural,cf4yawf,0,t5_2ql8e

237385,0,t1_cf3egfu,I see a lot of people on this thread making a bigger deal out of Sams terms than is really needed. At the end of the episode Sam said If you want to work lets work. If you want to be brothers... then a long pause. Sams terms were simply that he was willing to work with Dean but he wasnt ready to be his brother again. Sam amp Deans relationship needs fixing but Sam wasnt putting terms out there saying Dean needed to do something specific he was just saying that if dean wanted him to come back then it would be a purely professional relationship.,Supernatural,cf5csdt,1,t5_2ql8e
239414,0,t1_cf5j0x0,Or you could look at it as the writers are playing to each individual actors strength. Jensen is really good at those emotional scenes. The OPT one perfect tear and all that. Whereas over the course of the series Jared has had more chances to stretch his acting by playing multiple characters. He has been an angel a demon Lucifer soulless... He excels at that. I dont think the writers have written anything for Dean that even matches that except maybe playing a Levitation in season  but then that was alongside LevitationSam. ,Supernatural,cf5kein,5,t5_2ql8e

268569,0,t1_cf7scn9,Yeah I think when we think about it from Deans perspective most of us would have made the same decision.  Because as Dean said himself its not in him to let Sam go.  But that doesnt make it the right decision!  It was a situation with no good option and Dean chose the best option for himself knowing full well that it wasnt the best option for Sam.And he has not apologized!  He has expressed guilt that Kevin died but not that Sam had his bodily autonomy taken away for months.  Btw Dean could have tricked Sam into saying yes to save him in the short term and then told him the truth and begged him to let EzekielGadreel to stay at any point after that.  But he continued to keep the decision out of Sams hands.  Dean has stated that he would do the same things again and hasnt even acknowledged that there is another side to the argument.Its a fundamental disconnect and I dont see how theyre gonna make things right.Im a younger sibling too haha and while I intellectually understand Dean my heart always sides with Sam.,Supernatural,cf8lily,1,t5_2ql8e

372837,0,t1_cfjegq0,Dean ends up with a pretty raw deal and I like it because of the poetry and symmetry of the punishment. Throughout the show all Dean tried to do was keep his brother alive. He sold his soul because he couldnt stand being separated from his brother and because he couldnt stand to lose Sam. And in that act he doomed the world. Then we later learned that even if Sam died they would eventually be reunited in death. They would have eternity together after all. But Sam jumped into the Cage and no matter what Dean does even if he sends himself to Hell hell never reach Sam. Theyll never be together even in death. The very act that Dean committed to keep Sam alive was the one that dragged Sam away from him in the end. And hell have an eternity knowing that. Its unequal but there is certain irony and poetry to it. ,Supernatural,cfjerhx,3,t5_2ql8e

I do this by joining blockades and walking in Pride and other marches and by signing petitions.I want to point out to oppressors that they are oppressing people not feel sorry for me!. Also there is no reason for me to knock on shoulders and say could you maybe dismantle the rape culture for me?. Anger gets stuff done. It gives people human rights.And please when you say that you have experienced more oppression than I have which you have Im not disputing that why do you use a term which insults so many people around the world with mental disabilities?And when you say you dont like Tumblr you are basically saying that you dislike a space where everyone speaks their mind about oppression and microaggressions.

And he knew Castiels plan with the souls from the get go. Just like he knew about the leviathans. Thats why he gave Sam his soul back. It was a clue.

715250,0,t1_cglkhrk,Yep. I totally agree. Which is why I dont think season  is by any means the best season because it took the apocalypse and really made it pretty pathetic. It should have been  seasons long imo and holy shit the things you could do with it. My frustration with season  is compounded by the fact that there are SO many episodes that have nothing to do with the apocalypse and I think the episode with edit wrong actress Paris Hilton is simply unforgivable.

895885,0,t3_24bzp8,Not a good idea for a series guys. We already have The Originals. Rather than complain though I want to offer alternative ideas I feel are better. Supernatural Filbert ... a guy whos been unlucky his whole life never had many friends got kicked out of school over a misunderstanding took a deadend job at a gas station and losing his hair is working one night when theres a fight between the Winchesters and a ragtag team of different monsters. In a rather alarming accident a magical bolt meant for Dean misses and hits Filbert right as hes bitten by a vampire and slashed by a werewolf. Sam and Dean defeat the monsters and presume the guy is dead. Three days later he wakes up in the morgue. He feels fine. He feels better than fine. He goes back to work the next day flabbergasted by what happened and is so distracted he gets held up by a guy with a gun. When Filbert hands him the money they make skin contact and the robber starts convulsing. His eyes turn green his skin black and then he falls back. When he rises he calls Filbert master. Filbert has a minion. slowly but surely Fibert comes to realize that through a complete accident he was struck by three Alphas in just a way as to make him a candidate to be the new Mother of Monsters. Supernatural Spec Ops ... a team of five spec ops officers from the US military are tasked by a Senator who lost his family to demons to be the militarys response to major supernatural threats. They dont go from random place to random place but rather have intelligence to feed them major problems like a terroristtriggered Croatoan outbreak at a military base demons possessing major players in international business and politics a cult summoning an ancient aquatic destruction god in the Pacific Ocean to take out the Pacific fleet angels attempting to use famine etc. Theyre highly trained wellorganized funded with serious hardware but theyre also in uncharted territory for the military and have to adapt. Characters die and are replaced from time to time and it occasionally intertwines with Supernatural for major events. Supernatural the Gathering ... a group of highly intelligent but ultimately underachieving something friends stumble upon what they think is a game similar to DampD or Magic the Gathering but which is actually an ancient tome from a longlost sect of powerful sorcerers. They accidentally release a blood god into the world but also find within the tome the training to become a group of powerful wizards. A lot of it is about humor flying by the seat of their pants being way out of their depth and just barely managing to win out but they slowly but surely become more and more powerful more and more competent and more confident as a team. Charlie could become a regular. ,Supernatural,ch647av,6,t5_2ql8e

1152156,0,t3_27b4c9,Bobby and John were hugely respected in the hunter community.  Sam and Dean freaking Winchester are some of the greatest hunters to ever live.  I think other hunters respect them and want to steer clear of them.  Theres a lot talk they they started the apocalypse  but they stopped it again.  Hunters had to know that Lucifer was free and walking the Earth and that the Winchesters locked him up again.  Pretty sure thats major props.There does seem to be a network of hunters that Ellen Jo John Bobby and Garth were all much better connected with than the boys ever were but they do still keep contacts.  There are different episodes here and there where they reach out to random hunters so by and large Id say that they have some contact with the community.  ,Supernatural,chz8d2n,13,t5_2ql8e

1179165,0,t1_ci25vx4,gt everyone in this fandom seems to worhsip DeanNah Ive loved Sam since S amp I still prefer his character to Deans overall although without each other neither of them seem intensely compelling tbh.That said I generally get where people are coming from thinking Sams emotional distance was way too dragged out this season. I couldnt relate to either of them  if I were Dean I wouldve pissed Sam off so we could just have it out and then be good again which would probably end up in tearshugs. If I were Sam Id eventually get livid that Dean wasnt acknowledging my pain and just yell at him until he got it which would probably end up in tearshugs. Given testosterone levels neither option necessarily excludes throwing some punches. Thatd be fine too.Either way I just cant imagine two dudes whove lived with each other all their lives cool with being the passive aggressive little shits they were for a whole year. Sam gets the most crap for this because Dean was becoming more and more compromised as time went on. Both of them towards the end shouldve been thinking all right this has just got to stop. Instead Dean was thinking bladebladebladewantblade. What was Sams excuse? He didnt have one. So... he yknow gets shit for it.,Supernatural,ci29y3j,3,t5_2ql8e

1450639,0,t3_2arrhr,Heres one I came up with and put up a little while ago with favorable reviews!We have seen that demons have different eye colors. One that has stood out from the rest is Azazel who had yellow eyes. Azazel was a unique demon anyway giving a large bunch of kids psychic powers and we saw a big extent of that with Sam which arguably plagues him to this day. Azazel was also very devoted to Lucifer calling him padre even of course that was just how most demons spoke when speaking of Lucifer their father. What if though Lucifer was literally Azazels father?In season  we saw that Nephilim existed. Abominations born from an angel and a human. They seem to have angelic powers to some degree but it is unclear if they have a full soul like humans do. I would say they do for the sake of argument and that it likely isnt possible to make new grace and when they die they either go to heaven or hell like humans or perhaps purgatory. Before Lucifer was cast into the cage perhaps he obtained a vessel for a period of time and had a child with a human woman another big middle finger to God on top of creating the first demon Lilith from a human soul. This child would have been a Nephilim though with a soul and a place to go after death. This child would have likely been tainted from birth due to his lineage and when he died he went directly to hell. This unique soul would have been corrupted into a demon specifically Azazel. This would explain his bright yellow eyes angels in vessels obtain bright eyes when they power up sworn devotion to Lucifer and his ability to give Sam the powers he did. While yes Sams powers were demonic in nature... the fact he was able to exorcise and kill demons with his mind seem more akin to what angels can do.More so when Lucifer had that child the vessel he possessed may have very well been Abel hence why Cain was so desperate to save his brother. This adds another layer of complication. If that were the case Azazel is a distant relative to Sam and Dean.,Supernatural,ciy42xc,10,t5_2ql8e

Meh we can figure that out in another thread!.Id suspect Michael is the same.So think of it this way. It was destiny that Michael and Lucifer fight one day. Needless to say if this is destiny then absolutely by no means can they die before fighting. Id have to imagine they are nearly invincible probably immune to angel blades and Death reapers too. Gabriels only advice for stopping Lucifer was to lock him back up rather than kill him. It wasnt Gabriel or Raphaels destiny therefore they were susceptible to holy fire angel blades and energy from souls.,Supernatural,ck3fpfp,9,t5_2ql8e

2395355,0,t1_cm7rurr,ampampamp White AngloSaxon Protestant sfw gtgtWhite AngloSaxon Protestant WASP is an informal term sometimes disparaging  for a group of highstatus and influential White Americans of English Protestant ancestry. The term applies to a group believed to control disproportionate social political and financial power in the United States  The term WASP describes a group whose family wealth education status and elite connections allow them a degree of privilege held by few others. gtScholars agree that the groups influence has waned since the end of World War II with the growing influence of other American ethnic groups.  The term is also used in Canada and Australia for similar elites.  gtWhen the term appears in writing it usually indicates the authors disapproval of the groups excessive power in society. The hostile tone can be seen in an alternative dictionary The WASP culture has been the most aggressive powerful and arrogant society in the world for the last thousand years so it is natural that it should receive a certain amount of warranted criticism.  People seldom call themselves WASPs except humorously the acronym is typically used by nonWASPs. gtgtImage i  Harvard University historically a favored university for the WASP elite.

2472530,0,t1_cmh9kvj,Not everyone is a big a fan of Castiel. The ratings have been excellent for the three episodes he was not on and that included a Castiel Tumblr boycott for at least one of them. The thing with Castiel fans is that although they are quite loud sole Castiel fans are not the majority of Supernatural fans by any stretch and the numbers very clearly illustrate this fact. Bobby was a huge fan favorite. To this day many of us still cannot comprehend why he was killed off. He was a moral compass for the brothers and a strong emotional magnet in the story.  Im so over the angel stories and I wish the limp one we have been suffering through so far this year would just be shot and put out of its misery. If what it takes to stop this repetitive human morality tale about what it is to be human is to have Castiel give Jimmy back his body and head back to heaven then Im good with that. I do not believe that is what the show is doing though. I think they are bringing Claire back because she may have a portion of Castiels grace and they are going to use it to either find Castiels remaining grace andor pull the grace from Claire and leave Castiel as an underpowered angel. It may be upsetting to see Claire used this way but that could work. Then the deus ex machina problem would finally be solved and Castiel could become a useful part of the story without being overpowered. So dont get too excited chances are Castiel is not going anywhere imo. The question of Castiels possession of Jimmy Novak on earth is an interesting topic. If you look at it through an objective canon lense there is good money to be made on Jimmy still being there. Who knows what they are going to do with this? I really hope they end the speculation one way or another. It has been driving us canon geeks crazy forever and we would like an answer... finally.  ,Supernatural,cmhaxi4,2,t5_2ql8e

It was the only series I enjoyed that seemed like a horror movie every week. after season  it went downhill fast. Season  wasnt too bad but they get farther and farther from what the show originally sought out to be.Though to be fair the most recent episodes are getting back to that monster of the week feel. But with everything the Winchesters have been through and become theres no real suspense anymore.I only watch it now because Ive already come this far and my OCD will go crazy if I dont see it through. ,Supernatural,colcrv9,1,t5_2ql8e

The orphanage story around here is Gore Orphanage was burnt down by an angry janitor with the kids and staff inside.

Heard they got caught today which is great because I cant remember what they actually looked like for shit.You know what Osama Bin Laden or Sadam Hussein look like but those guys you see on the news wanted for bank robbery or murder or whatever? Theres too many of em and they dont get constant coverage like the guys we can think of off the tops of our heads. Were overstimulated with small time bad guys and we tend not to pay any attention to them unless its part of our jobs.So it wouldnt surprise me if anyone ever recognized them up to a year later even cops. I would whittle it down to maybe the police and FBI actively investigating the murders being the only people who might still recognize them.Theres plenty of other plotholes but Im actually glad they didnt go for the usual hey arent you the guys from the news a xtime ago trope because it seems more realistic that people dont actually remember or care.,Supernatural,cplu1u2,14,t5_2ql8e

They indicate that they move on but dont really know what that means.As for the shoot first attitude I think they really handled that well in seasons  when they start to examine the grey area between good and evil. John raised the boys in a very blackandwhite mindset  if its supernatural its evil and therefore we kill it. But in S the boys start to encounter monsters who have a sense of morality and humans who are definitely evil and it makes them start to question their fathers teachings.

We dont know that much about what his life was like other than him selling his soul for a few extra inches below the belt. This episode is one of the best in my opinion. Its so heartbreaking to hear Crowley scream out I deserve to be loved with tears in his eyes. Deep down there is a human soul wanting nothing but peace. Then hearing Sam telling Dean about his greatest sin. Its so sad so broken. It also really pisses me off logically how Dean refuses to let Sam finish. Yes Sam dies but they close the gates of hell! Isnt that worth it? They always said they will eventually give their lives for their cause. This is the ultimate sacrifice but also for the ultimate prize.

4018347,0,t1_cr2cbdy,I imagine that the book was attempting to be literal. The fact that its so off mark was probably caused by a lack of understanding as to what the Stynes were actually doing.She was just a family friend who peeked her head in at the wrong time. She likely saw lots of body parts and one man sewing dead parts onto an unconscious seemingly dead man. Then she freaked out rushed away to bed to pretend she didnt see anything and woke up the next morning to see the man from the operating table groggily eating breakfast at the table with the rest of the family.With just this to go on the whole thing looks like the guy got put together out of nothing from corpse parts just like in Marys book. She probably never even entertained the notion that the guy was actually alive while someone calmly sewed a new arm to him and most certainly not that the man was a willing participant who asked for it to be done to him.As far as Mary was concerned Frankenstein outed the Frankenstein family as exactly what they were  heathens stitching together newborn corpsepeople.,Supernatural,creblq2,1,t5_2ql8e

4210574,0,t3_371jvw,I dont think the darkness is Hades or from the Titans since its shown that pagan gods are cannon fodder compared to archangels or at least Lucifer. The darkness is shown to be past prebiblical. Prior to creation God and the Archangels had to beat the darkness back and sealed them with the Mark being the key entrusted to the one God trusted most  Lucifer.Eventually the Mark got a will of its own most likely from the Darkness. It can be argued that the Darkness is the precursor to demons since the Mark influenced Lucifer leading to the creation of the first demon Lilith then corrupting eve into becoming the mother of monsters and the humans were cast out of paradise. Then the mark was passed on to Cain who became the knight of hell and later created the knights of hell.TL DR The mark was influential in creating the first fallen angel Lucifer the first demon Lilith the first monster Eve and the first murderer Cain. ,Supernatural,cs06y20,2,t5_2ql8e

4461124,0,t1_csrvb2z,I agree with everything here except that I dont think God and likely Death should be included on the list since Lucifer says there are only five things in all of creation that can be killed by the Colt. Lucifer is talking about Gods creation so unless God created himself God cant be on the list. And since Death implies that he was around before God started creating that would suggest that Death cant be on the list either. This line of thought would also apply to the Darkness. I think we should note that even though Michael is objectively more powerful than Lucifer Lucifer being immune to the Colt doesnt necessarily mean Michael would be. For just one example if Lucifer is immune to the Colt because of his connection to the Mark and the Darkness Michael would have no such immunity.Otherwise this is a great writeup.

So many fan writers rewrite canon to improve it and depending on my thoughts amp tastes they do it remarkably well. But in any event we do it because this show evokes a mix between criticism and inspiration in equal measure for us amp so we follow through with those sentiments by writing fanfic or drawing art or whatever.Actually this makes me think about the schism between transformative fans of the show amp congoers. Becky is not to me a typical fanfic writer. In reality we tend to be a lot more thoughtful critical amp dry amp were rarely full of adoration with starry devoted eyes... I feel like Becky was more representative of what the actors amp writers see of fans at conventions during photo ops where theyre rather understandably celebrityshocked and freaked out.,Supernatural,cu9reg7,1,t5_2ql8e

In another post some months ago I assumed that the Darkness would be some if not all of the Lovecraftian Old Ones because they also resemble an ancient evil that lurked the void before Creation and could whisper through the lock and drive people e.g. the bearer of the mark insane. In the end its always the same approach an ancient evil that existed far before anything else and has been locked away for good but keeps waiting until it gets the chance to break free.

5339830,0,t3_3o4bkl,I honestly at this point dont know why Im watching anymore.  Even the alphas required a lot of retconning.  Im different from a lot of other people in that I only really loved the first  seasons and once angels were introduced it went downhill fast.  There were several good episodes in those seasons but thats when continuity really broke off.  For me the show can be broken down into  different shows excluding the main characters.  Seasons  the classic rock era seasons  the angels era and .Part of the problem with making a new big bad is that the previous big bads become neutered.  As you stated demons arent scary anymore and a lot of this I dont think can be retconned anymore. For example Rowena and Crowley.  When witches were first introduced they got their power from demons and were beholden to them.  Now apparently a witch can conquer all demons with power from ???,Supernatural,cvu80ae,6,t5_2ql8e

Im not a religious person so my understanding of Christianity basically goes as far as understanding heaven hell god angels demons. As far as I knew there was no other cosmic entity on a godlike level as we are told the Darkness is. And as others have stated if she is his sister does that mean literal sister so siblings which would mean there were parents at some point?And we got to see Lucys cage Im like  sure that was his cage.

Now that shes back she still has the need to consume his creations.,Supernatural,cwxnbn5,4,t5_2ql8e

They drive me nuts haha. Some would say its good acting I say its overacting. And Kevin Tran better come back this season or Im gonna be pissed haha....or maybe he already did as a ghost. Guess I missed that episode. But back on board,Supernatural,cx0m5sc,1,t5_2ql8e

5950582,0,t3_3wu16l,For some reason I think God showing up at the start of the nd half of the season would be anticlimatic. It would be like oh Im sorry for ignoring you all this time its time to make it right then whoosh Sams out of the cage resolves things with the Darkness gets rid of demons reestablish heaven etc.However if God doesnt show then we get Dean Castiel amp crew figure out how Lucifer reached out to Sam and how to get him out speculation. How to deal with The Darkness restoring order to heaven and hell and all of this could be fixed by God but I think it would be more a story if they focus on the nd half being searching for God it would be more interesting to see what the crew have to go through to get in touch with God what they have to sacrifice to get his attention if he is paying attention at all. Maybe they have to commit some catastrophe or something else for some ritual to summon god or something who knows. It is just a better angle to work from rather than just bringing in God to deus ex machina everything. ,Supernatural,cxznghb,5,t5_2ql8e

Amara gets her claws even deeper into Dean to the point that hes compelled to joinsave her at all costs. God sees that Sammy has lost Dean and finally appears to help Sam defeat the darkness and possibly save his brother. It comes down to this final battle God vs. Amara Sam vs. Dean. Sibling vs. Sibling.  God wins obviously the bad guys never win but with Dean protecting Amara and Sam protecting God the two of them end up destroying each other. Then they have their I was just trying to do the right thing speech before God finally gives them peace. And of course Bobby has to make an appearance in heaven just to further emotionally scar the fandom for life. TLDR Sam sides with God Dean sides with Amara. They kill each other and get sent to heaven where Bobby calls them idgits one last time.,Supernatural,czye42i,5,t5_2ql8e

If the show is going to continue it needs to be something fresh and Crowley and Castiel are really overplayed by now. I mean they write the most ridiculous crap to keep these characters relevant.

7291014,0,t3_4f76ps,I think a lot of people are going to disagree with you.In general theyve done a good job of tying the main plot into some of the filler episodes. And a show like supernatural is always going to have case episodes. Its a part of the show.And tbh this has been the best season in quite awhile. The only stinker episode so far  in my opinion  was the werewolf one. And the rest have been solid. Lets take say the last five seasons. This season by far is the one I have the fewest complaints about.Amara could be a bigger part for sure.

7338759,0,t1_d29qroc,Of course I agree the credit goes to the writers for implementing different ways to develop Sams character over the years. But it would be wrong to say Dean hasnt been provided similar changes as well. He had the awesome switchup from being a playboy hunter who values family to a war veteran Im saying that about his return from hell in s who himself said he was a soldier who went through hell and back literally. Again with his Purgatory storyline where it was almost like throwing him in Hunger Games and pulling him out. Lets not forget Demon Dean as well.My only problem? He was the same guy the same Dean Winchester we knew in every character changes. I expected a broken man not a guy who drinks a lot and cries on queue gets angry and punches shit. I didnt see a different person whereas Soulless Sam creeped the fuck out of me like Jake Gyllenhaal did in Nightcrawler. ,Supernatural,d2cd7hh,3,t5_2ql8e

Your DBZ comparison has no place here there has never been a fight in Supernatural in which the attacks caused planet wide destruction.

At that time I thought that maybe thats because Dean has some Mark mojo but this episodes fight disappointed me.The Cass we knew wouldve obliterated that british chick. Sure they want to power down the angels but theyve made him look like a pussy. If she wouldve used a sigil or something it wouldve been okay but this is so disappointing.ALSO isnt Dean like a superbadass in handtohand combat because of his time in purgatory. Even he couldnt fight her and went down easily.

10064951,0,t3_5jtb4g,Eh. Season  was a good place to close the show. Its sort of like how in Smallville it really could have ended after season .I liked season  quite a bit.Season  was probably my least favorite season.Season  is decent but very forgettable.Season ? Uhh... less forgettable slightly? But still just decent.Season ? ...Look Im gonna be honest with you. After season  they all sort of blend together. You cant keep meaningful connections with characters because they all leave. The plot isnt terribly consistent and it kind of feels strung together.Other seasons are mediocre if only just because you dont feel like the show knows where its going. But beyond that the shows formula is to introduce a threat forget about a threat for filler episodes the majority of the season and then remember the main threat of the season long enough to kill it off in some arbitrary deusexmachina way. The threat should have been omnipresent and imposing but because its Supernatural we have to have the main characters kill off a random evil spirit or demon or witch for an episode.Its just not great. Watch it if you like but I still feel like season  was the shows true logical ending point.,Supernatural,dbjhiv5,0,t5_2ql8e

Dean  being Dean so come on  basically said no problem because... Shocker... It was no problem to him.  And is that a bad thing? Because lets remember that they were lying to her and sort of accidentally insinuated to her that shed date raped Dean! Which is actually a terrible thing to do! And wasnt true at all. So of course Dean is gong to indicate that he had no problem with it. Because he wasnt actually roofied. Was he supposed to pretend to be horrified?

10719008,0,t1_ddljy4c,Well I guess I thought Its fucking incest was a given so my bad. Ive never understood that. I have two same gender siblings and the idea that anybody sees us hanging out or sleeping on the same bed and thinks we must be doing something sexual despite knowing were siblings is weird to me. As far as SampD go I have no beef with people in universe confusing them for a gay couple. Its the out of universe Wincest thats odd to me bc the fandom knows theyre siblings but still insists that their closeness has to be sexual. Now I know a lot of that is just the fact that the nonbiologically related actors are super hot but the fan fiction by in large is about the biological siblings crossing the incest line and the implication is squicky IMO. As far as Destiel I really enjoy Cas and Deans interactions and I see them as platonic and fraternal. I feel like Destiel is based on the idea that only homosexual men get to be vulnerable and emotional so the fact that Cas and Dean and Dean and Sam are often both towards each other is proof of that theyre lovers. Disliking Destiel is not intended on my part to be a slam against being homosexual. But the reasoning I usually see to support it usually amounts to heterosexual men are clearly emotionally stunted and averse to any and all physical contact right? The logic really is kind of a slam against both sides. I guess I disagree with people who insist that there is no such thing as platonic and that every gesture of friendship is actually a subtextual sign of deep desire. But thats just my personal opinion.Having said all that I have never given anybody a hard time about what they ship. Theyre fictional characters. Like what you like. ,Supernatural,ddll45r,7,t5_2ql8e
10724738,0,t1_ddlr1d2,gt Simply stated there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction.Well people can be wrong or misinformed without lying. But was he even wrong? Here is the preceding few paragraphs to that quote to put it in contextgtYet Saddam Hussein had sought to frustrate and deceive them at every turn and was often successful in doing so. Ill cite one instance. During the spring of  the inspectors were actually on the verge of declaring that Saddams programs to develop chemical weapons and longerrange ballistic missiles had been fully accounted for and shut down. Then Saddams soninlaw suddenly defected and began sharing information. Within days the inspectors were led to an Iraqi chicken farm. Hidden there were boxes of documents and lots of evidence regarding Iraqs most secret weapons programs. That should serve as a reminder to all that we often learned more as the result of defections than we learned from the inspection regime itself.gtTo the dismay of the inspectors they in time discovered that Saddam had kept them largely in the dark about the extent of his program to mass produce VX one of the deadliest chemicals known to man. And far from having shut down Iraqs prohibited missile programs the inspectors found that Saddam had continued to test such missiles almost literally under the noses of the U.N. inspectors. ,Supernatural,ddm6dro,0,t5_2ql8e

11523063,0,t3_64h7rz,Youre not alone. I wish Crowley was treated nicer by the boys but I also feel like the whole frienemy thing is what makes me like him and feel empathy for him on an even grander scale. His life even as the king of hell is kind of tragic because he gets shafted by everyone down to his mother and servants.It makes me want to hug him and love him even more. I really hope at some point the boys can welcome him as part of TFW because Crowley is one of my absolute favorites. If they kill him off I will riot.,Supernatural,dg2536j,19,t5_2ql8e
11532942,0,t1_dg38wnj,Yeah I was like maaan you deserved so much more... But I like how mature Dean is he is angry his problem with Mary is not resolved BUT he has his own priorities and his priorities was never his own happiness from the first all he wanted was for his family to be alive and happy and despite being sad and angry at Mary despite the feeling of being neglected he still wishes for them to be happy. Aarghhhh I get angry at how much he suffers for his family and gets so little in return... I want to see Mary losing the noys trust and regretting her choices...,Supernatural,dg39eua,2,t5_2ql8e

11705580,0,t3_66x4p6,The camerawork is so much less inspired than it was in the earlier seasons. It used to legitimately feel like a horror movie. At this point it just seems like theyre worried about getting the subject in the frame and thats about it. Also The detective work is always SUPER convenient.

Id only call shenanigans if Lucifer amp Crowley actually meet amp face off and Crowley somehow survives... although Lucifer cracked Rowrows neck amp she still survived because shed premagicked a resurrection.

11783126,0,t1_dguq35n,I think the part where we find out the nephilim is communicating with Kelly is a subtle hint that were not going to suffer many or any child actors once the nephilims born. If its sentient in the womb its appearance could hopefully immediately become a visual representation of a grown human with a lil more physical agency and acting ability than a kid.,Supernatural,dgvnlyv,1,t5_2ql8e
