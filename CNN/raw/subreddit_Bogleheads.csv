4034004,0,t1_crg2rpy,Ok so that clears up quite a bit but I have some follow up  . That makes sense. . So in the event that I need more bonds than the Roth IRA limit should I get a Roth k and can I do that outside of going through my employer? . I thought the idea of putting International Stock in taxable accounts is because you can get a tax credit. If that is not the case or not the most taxsavvy way what taxadvantaged account should I place these in?Additionally what fund should I be getting with my k? I think most people at least donate to ks to get their employer matching but it doesnt seem to be mentioned in the Asset Allocation sectionmaybe I missed it. ,Bogleheads,crg3vf9,2,t5_2shb7

If so do some research before moving the money  you might need to take regular withdrawals over your expected lifetime or face penalties and taxes.  Assuming its not...  Reading up on investing is important especially from books that quote decades of stock market performance.  Books like A Random Walk Down Wall Street give a good level of detail about what can happen investing without knowing stock market history.  If the money is meant for decades from now  stocks seems more reasonable than  bonds.  Stocks provide painful drops but also higher expected growth than bonds.  Bonds help you keep your money safe from stock market drops  which is more important as you need to preserve your money in retirement.  Make sure none of those k funds are load funds and then sure buy more before the year ends if you like.  The  fee is a lot but some funds remove over  upon purchase  really need to avoid those when you have roughly one year left in the plan.,Bogleheads,d8rfkko,2,t5_2shb7
9746871,0,t1_daei6yc,If you really want to own bonds you can replicate Vanguards own target retirement fund which would have you  in bonds. Or you could just invest in the target retirement fund and save yourself the headache. I have an adviser at Vanguard Im  and they suggest no bonds even at my  years on you.If this is retirement money you have no need to mitigate risk when youve got no skin in the game yet. If your net worth was a million dollars already then fine add in bonds but if you are getting started saving then bonds will only hold you back.,Bogleheads,daeiiv9,3,t5_2shb7
10268415,0,t1_dc7x74m,I do already have investments.  I have a K and a brokerage account.  I actually just bought VTI in my brokerage account with some cash I had from selling a craft beer stock.I may take a look at the Dummy books too.  I dont need to know everything.  I just want a basic understanding of what is going on.  What to look for when buying do I ever sell them like you would stocks or just keep them and continually add money to each fund etc.,Bogleheads,dc7zbu1,1,t5_2shb7
