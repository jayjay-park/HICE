1984340,0,t1_cks8u9r,I really like Tate this week going against the Jets but Gore is the play.  SF should look to control the ball and the clock.,FF10HalfPPR,cksbamf,1,t5_33ppu
1987039,0,t3_2hfpfn,Ive got Jordan Matthews in for AJ this week. Should I get Keenan Allen on the field somehow? Lineup ,FF10HalfPPR,cksn06f,2,t5_33ppu
2121887,0,t1_cl9c2xk,Thanks for the advice. I am not going to offer the above trade. Sadly no one in my league sees the value of bradshaw so it looks like he will be hanging on my team. ,FF10HalfPPR,cl9jdsl,1,t5_33ppu
2240350,0,t1_clol5yp,Check out their matchups plus with Calvin coming back they have to respect the pass a lot more,FF10HalfPPR,cloloh8,2,t5_33ppu
2300206,0,t1_clvvl6t,Sounds like Gordon is now off the table. I think Im set at RB and WR Id really like a better TE. Is something like Benjamin or Hillman  Donnell for Julius or Graham overpaying or a good idea?,FF10HalfPPR,clw0ssk,1,t5_33ppu
