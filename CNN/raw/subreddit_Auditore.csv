3556007,0,t1_cpxak7y,Thanks that is helpful.  Ive tended to stick with the easy kills so far but will look to take on more risk to get higher HP wins.  Once I get a decent Dot dealer on my farming team I can farm higher levels in Giants for better runes.  Its been slow going so far with that hole in my farming team.,Auditore,cpxlx96,2,t5_37kxo
