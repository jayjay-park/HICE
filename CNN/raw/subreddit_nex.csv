517867,0,t3_20092o,Heres a great article that should help you understand star photography better. Your friend doesnt know what hes talking about what you really need is a tripod and a fast amp wide prime lens. Set up the tripod compose your shot focus to infinity open the aperture all the way up and then do a long exposure with the camera set to self timer. ,nex,cfz4vs4,7,t5_2vriy
938219,0,t1_chax2ud,Oh haha nevermind my bad!  I was talking about the A which I wanted but I need the EVF.  The A looks amazing just a bit out of my price range The NEX w the  lenses is really pushing it as is at the present time maybe not too long down the road tho ,nex,chaxiut,1,t5_2vriy

1295691,0,t3_28x7i3,I have both LAEA and LAEA for my NEX and A respectively. Theyre both good but there are some small issues you should be aware of    . The obvious one is the lightloss you get with the SLTmirror in the adapter. Its only rd of a stop but light loss is still light loss.    . The bulge on the bottom of the adapter can be kind of uncomfortable to hold depending on the shape of the lens attached. For a small lens like the SALF you mentioned its fine but when you attach a zoom on there it can get kind of awkward.    . Then obviously you lose stabilization but its not an issue for shortermedium focal lengths.    . The SALF uses that awful SAM motor to focus its pretty slow compared the Emount version SELF.    . Finally specifically for the LAEA adapter but not with the LAEA oddly theres an issue where if you attach a heavy lens lbs to the adapter there can be occasional connection issues the lens aperture control and shutter becomes inoperable until you wiggle or reattached the adapter to the camera. I suspect this is due to the positions of the connectors on the Aside and Eside of the adapter when the lens weighs it down. I experienced this with the SALZ  LAEA  A and it can sometimes be frustrating when you miss a shot.      If you want to get it by all means its very useful if you have a lot of Amount or Minolta lenses but if you dont have any old lenses to use with it immediately you have to consider the real cost at least for the first lensSALF is  retail the LAEA is  retail which puts you in the  range. For that you could pick up the SELF instead  used on eBay ish retail and that lens basically stays on my NEX plus you get stabilization you dont lose that rd stop of light and its smaller overall.      I think you should come up with a larger list of lenses you want to use with it first before you buy the adapter. Then see if theres an Emount version thats equivalent or better for a cheaper price. Otherwise it becomes a less useful investment. I had a similar thought as you when I migrated from A to E mount but the reality for me anyway is that I never ended up using that many lenses with it mm mm mm mm. Currently I only use the LAEA with my Sigma Amount mm f.. Ive sold the mm too heavy and the mm and mm are just sitting in my closet.Lastly if you still want it get the LAEA not the LAEA since you have an upgrade path to full frame the AF points are the same between the two adapters the coverage area is the same for the AF groups and avoid heavy lenses with it. Let me know if you have any questions.Edit I cant format to save my life.,nex,cifdriu,7,t5_2vriy

4641189,0,t3_3ej9h8,Why the Canon version? You need an expensive adapter just to change the aperture and the AF will be very bad. The native Sony mm f. is cheaper than the combo and stabilization and decent AF. Or you could just buy an old manual mm and a cheap adapter.,nex,ctfl733,2,t5_2vriy
