1996886,0,t1_cksl5e2,In my case it wears off in about  days completely and it daydreaming come a bit stronger then before. It wont be as strong as in the first days though it will decrease by   after day  more and more afterwards well this is my experience.  ,MaladaptiveDreaming,ckttpj1,1,t5_2ys3w
2542265,0,t3_2ogirn,Very much so especially now that Ive improved socially its become an obvious crutch for me to deal with stress and from feeling too low. For me i find its a great comfort and just gets me through these tough times however i know not everyone sees it as a positive i would suggest replacing DM and do something active or just take you mind to something like a book movie or tv show indulge on netflix or something? or even that confront what is making you stressed and depressed talk to some one about it,MaladaptiveDreaming,cmqet5n,1,t5_2ys3w
2907262,0,t3_2tdogm,Good progress. Ive started to do something familiar.When I find myself DDing I kind of break the fourth wall and say  you realize youre doing this dont you?. Its a sort of jolt that dissipates my fantasy. But by itself its not enough. The only thing that really helpsme is keeping busy being mentally and physically active. Thanks for sharing and keep at it! ,MaladaptiveDreaming,cnyk9kh,4,t5_2ys3w

3193221,0,t3_2oowjs,A virtual reality where I have a variety of special abilities and a spaceship named Ship. I battle evil clans and collect damaged robots and repair them so they can help maintain my ship. Its been going on for over  years and ive not been visiting it nearly as much now that im older but still do occasionally. Other times its disasters at public places like tornadoes giants invading stuff like that. Monsters peaking out from under tiles on the floor. I totally feel insane now. Glad to know im not alone.,MaladaptiveDreaming,cosz6v5,1,t5_2ys3w
4749106,0,t3_3fwbm7,I would not consider myself an introvert but I would consider myself much quieter compared to my group of friends. Also to answer your question about MD getting better during periods of being social the answer is YES. When I went on vacation with my friends for the weekend and didnt MD whatsoever the whole weekend my MDing decreased significantly over the past  months compared to how it was before. Essentially the best way to reduce MDing for me at least is to always try to put yourself in social situations. It might be hard at first cuz the need to MD is always on your mind but after a while you will forget the urge is even there.,MaladaptiveDreaming,ctt64rl,1,t5_2ys3w
4963022,0,t3_3hxd7a,Yes it is a problem still. Keep pushing on and try to get rid of it. As long as it is there it will bother you. Just get rid of it if you successfully quit and look back at this post two years from now you will see the craziness.,MaladaptiveDreaming,cuk4m1u,1,t5_2ys3w
5098132,0,t3_3jtwns,This is exactly how my MD is.  I pace around always with my earbuds in and listen to a select amount of music.  There are definitely parts of a song that I get excited for and skip to for my daydream it just enhances it and I get impatient with the music...sometimes the rest of the songs dont fit well with the scenario.  I also use many real life characters with a handful a new ones that dont exist.  But every plot is related to the real world in some way.  ,MaladaptiveDreaming,cv0ijzl,2,t5_2ys3w
5901704,0,t1_cxt7swc,Yes I would be embarrassed to tell anyone too! Im kind of just content to know I am not the only one that does this. I feel worlds better. I am actually getting help now for anxiety so I might just bring this up next time I meet with my therapist. We were discussing coping mechanisms that I use and this is definitely one of them! ,MaladaptiveDreaming,cxt8wn5,2,t5_2ys3w
5911281,0,t1_cxuhnsb,I tried talking to her about it cause I really thought I wanted help stopping. I dont know how I did it haha. It was terrifying and embarrassing. And yeah regarding the realness of MD  I dont know if I even want it to be in the DSM. It would feel strange being actually diagnosed with it.,MaladaptiveDreaming,cxui2fa,1,t5_2ys3w
6735011,0,t1_d0fmq4f,Thank you for all the ideas! That last one in particular about replacing it with other habits seems like just what I was looking for. Its given me lots of hope finding someone whos been able to regulate it consistently. ,MaladaptiveDreaming,d0fyj1c,1,t5_2ys3w
6779957,0,t1_czswruo,Maybe for you but just because someone elses MD is a little different from yours doesnt invalidate how they feel or how serious their MD is.. Maybe you misunderstood or something because I empathized with this a lot.,MaladaptiveDreaming,d0ksj6b,1,t5_2ys3w

9651828,0,t3_5bf4kv,This is my first ever reddit postcommentanything. Thank you for this!!! DD is such a hard habit to break and it is so rare to find others who are having success in kicking it. Your post is giving me hope and motivation. Keep it up Im rooting for you!,MaladaptiveDreaming,da2sdjb,1,t5_2ys3w
9653402,0,t1_da2roev,Mine has elements of tv shows too elements of everything really. Details of whatever I watch know no of get sucked into it but never the show its self e.g. The Goauld from Stargate have made an appearance but just that ONE thing no actual characters from the Stargate universe are in my DD. ,MaladaptiveDreaming,da2zdjg,1,t5_2ys3w
10192743,0,t3_5l5gnh,Wow. Ive just got to say Im so happy Ive found this sub.When Im really deep into MD I am usually listening to music at a loud volume and sort of doing a slight runskip. I will sometimes dance as well although rather badly lol. Unless Im in bed putting on my night time daydream I need to be moving in order to really get into my fantasies. Sometimes just walking will work. I tend to walk at a faster pace when listening to music because thats how my daydreaming is triggered. ,MaladaptiveDreaming,dbzejje,6,t5_2ys3w

10216984,0,t3_5lyl51,Thank you for sharing you storyIve been doing it since I was about  and am like  now. Its had its ups and downs but I attempt to look at things positively and the people in my life are used to me doing it so they are somewhat supportive Mine consist of like  past lives and stuff. All sorts of times and places and settings other worlds and such but like i have this reoccurring set of like  characters  guys  girls though in some lives their different sexes or creaturs to which they show up in different places being reincarnated over and over Though there is a large portion which is like multi generational. Following the children of one of the lives and then them having children and such. Over time I turned some of them into stories and about five or  years ago I started sharing and publishing them. I always like when people tell me my characters feel so real. Because for so long they have felt real to me. Do you ever share your stories with others? ,MaladaptiveDreaming,dc25icj,4,t5_2ys3w
10484642,0,t3_5q5tjn,Maybe ask her what she thinks about you. If you are worried that shes judging you maybe try and be open about it. I dont know if itll help but its probably the best way to make sure she can actually help you.amp if nothing else... People are always judging each other that probably cant be helped but people forget their judgments just as quickly again. And you are awesome dont forget that.,MaladaptiveDreaming,dcwjk8z,7,t5_2ys3w
10711261,0,t3_5t7mam,gtIf i love novelty and greatness so much why dont i do it?Real life is not fun its not as fun the lives TV characters have. Unless you are super rich then maybe life can be fun.,MaladaptiveDreaming,ddksbat,2,t5_2ys3w

10900207,0,t1_de49owz,I dont make the decision to discard them it just kind of happens I dont control the daydream and they do things I dont expect all the time. For example a main character took off after his marriage fell apart I know hes still alive out there in dream world somewhere but none of the other characters have seen him since so neither have I. I guess I could make myself DD him and see what hes up to but I dont really like forcing things.,MaladaptiveDreaming,de4a1wi,3,t5_2ys3w
10937363,0,t3_5vw798,I can never daydream on purpose if you know what I mean. Like if I try to do it to see what it looks like on camera I wouldnt be able to do it until tha tthought slips away and I just start naturally. ,MaladaptiveDreaming,de8420i,3,t5_2ys3w
11195633,0,t1_df0yl26,It does. My day dreams last...a week. Usually I think of a plot play out the key points and move on.With the day dream that I had for  or  years I had to think of everything. I had a plot and side plots and developed different characters. I would have    hour day dream sessions. Every character was so detailed and had such an intricate story.Now my day dreams range from.. minutes to an hour If its something I want to play out from beginning to end.Honestly breaking my day dream was the worst thing. I still miss it. Those characters I knew them. Theyre happiness made me happy and I played out my social fantasies with them. I no longer name my characters. No name. What do they look like? Dont care. Setting? NopeI have brief visuals of the characters and setting but nothing detailed. Helps me not delve in too deep.It it kinda sucks. MDD is an addiction. But I like having my day dream sessions be something I can either avoid or keep to  minutes.,MaladaptiveDreaming,df10fcr,4,t5_2ys3w
11353218,0,t1_dfim1eb,Ive just always been really selfanalytical to be honest. So when theres a change I notice it and make a mental note. Like I consciously knew that I was switching plots one evening about two days ago and it popped into my head briefly oh this is a switch...any reason? ...no? Well ok whatever and then continue on. So I guess Im not putting too much thought into it but I sort of just...make a mental note of when it happens and then after some time passes Ill look back and try to see if any real life event happened around it that might have contributed.Selfanalysis really works best when looking at past rather than present. But I guess thus far in this situation I havent had much luck finding the correlation lol.,MaladaptiveDreaming,dfiv70q,3,t5_2ys3w
