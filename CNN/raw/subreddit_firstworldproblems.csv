27708,0,t1_cehb7x8,Wing spars are the strongest part of an airplane.  Its what the engines are essentially attached to.  Engines on top of a wing are no different than engines mounted underneath the wing.Like udvc said the HondaJet is just such a radical new design.  A light composite jet using brand new unproven jet engines with everevolving avionics.  The jet engine alone takes a considerable amount of proving before it can be certified which it very recently gained the okay.  Since its been in development for such a long time avionics construction and jet engine tech has changed very significantly as technology advances.  Therefore the program has been constantly adapting.  Then the airframe has to go through certification.  Once they send it through to get a type certificate it must be in its final form...aka all systems must be homogenous from then on or youre going through the certification all over again.  All this done through the bureaucracy of the FAA who is never in a hurry to do anything.Aviation is tricky.  It takes a lot of moving parts and a bigger mountain of paperwork to make an airplane fly.  When you want to do something as radical as Honda wants to do it takes a very long time to come out with the certified finished product.  Theres no doubt the HondaJet will change the game when and if it gets certified.  I have no doubt it will but it might be another few years before they start making deliveries.  Honda as a company has a lot of money.  gt years developing an aircraft would bankrupt most companies before they even got a prototype off the ground.  At this point theyre far too deeply committed to it to abandon the project now. ,firstworldproblems,cehl50q,1,t5_2sa5n

Hes also the chairman of the Open Border Foundation who gave phamplets to Syrian refugees in how to get to Europe.
