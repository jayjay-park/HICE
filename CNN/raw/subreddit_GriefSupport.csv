2872898,0,t1_cngoqmr,hi.. he died in June ... it was a sudden death.. he commit suicide and till today I still feel this tremendous anger towards him... I feel like I am not living everyday but I am not ready to give up on life yet just that I do not know how I could get out of this grief cloud and this sense of aloneness... I fear going out and seeing other couples or young families it hurt a lot inside. I hope I am able to have another beginning in my life as I struggle with this daily right now. I read that time does not heal and this frightens me a lot as theres no way I could keep on living in pain like this,GriefSupport,cnundv6,2,t5_2s36e

4117667,0,t3_37szgr,I cannot even imagine your loss. Traumatizing in so many ways. The fact that you have to relive it via lawsuits is hard enough. The fact that you dont have to relive all of the other details but still do seems even worse. My brain did this same thing when my best friend passed. Read every single text. Years of texts. Watched all of the videos. Kept a shirt. Combed incesently over details that in hindsight  years later were unnecessary to go through. But I still did it. Id get stuck in a rut mentality not able to think about anything until I finished my memory of a detail. Youre not alone in the way youre grieving. Stay as positive as you can. Its that annoying phrase everyone who doesnt know what to say says but its true. Find that silver lining as much as possible.  Thats literally the only way I held myself together long enough to be able to choose when to go over those details for good reasons instead. Especially until you can tell yourself you did NOT fail as a mom.Condolences to you and your family. ,GriefSupport,crpn1tp,4,t5_2s36e

5980620,0,t3_3xb4es,I just hit the three year mark in November. I went through many stages and still get very down all the time.Whats been helping me most is doing stuff we would have done together. I look up at the sky and tell her I miss her and I wish she was here. Sounds stupid but I feel like it makes us connected somehow.For me Ill never get over it. I will always miss her. But talking to her and doing those things certainly makes it easier. Keep pushing forward and dont pressure yourself to get over it. Its impossible so dont make yourself feel bad that you cant do it. Sending love your way. ,GriefSupport,cy3la09,1,t5_2s36e

7000154,0,t3_4ag3fh,I am going through the same thing except my moms mom. You are grieving yourself and you are grieving for your dad right now. Its definitely hard  Theres not much you can say or do when faced with this situation to make someone feel better. Its best to let them be heard let them mourn and be there for them when they need you most. Im terribly sorry for your loss... I know this feeling all too well.,GriefSupport,d19t7yp,2,t5_2s36e
7092092,0,t3_4co5c0,I would be honest with her but also tell her you do care for her and her family and that youd like to still be her friend and support system during this terrible time. Pretending you want to be in the relationship isnt kind but you dont have to stop being her friend just because you dont want to be more now. It may be she wont accept that but maybe she will and shell be grateful for the support of a friend. You dont have to be dating her to be a friend. ,GriefSupport,d1k99yj,5,t5_2s36e

9235114,0,t3_52ohc5,I know you are just trying to pick up the pieces.  Im sure you are probably still in shock and shouldnt feel guilty.  I have had many people say things to try to comfort me but the one thing I remembered the most was my best friend who sat with me and held my hand. I felt nice not having to talk for awhile. I know there is a huge whole in your heart right now.  I am sorry for your loss. ,GriefSupport,d8mm9r3,1,t5_2s36e

9388895,0,t1_d95ymco,Missed that in the post  but undoubtedly the date had meaning to him....  probably time for the family to share what they know about motivations.   Holding back info is just fueling OPs pain....,GriefSupport,d963xaj,1,t5_2s36e
9438423,0,t1_d9bsqn0,Oh my gosh. Im so sorry for your loss. The sudden loss is especially devastating. It will get better. And I totally believe that you will find someone that loves all your flaws. My relationship with my boyfriend is difficult I wont lie about that. It feels like I am always in the shadow of this large untouchable presence. But every time I make him laugh or smile it makes all the shitty feelings of guilt worth it. To bring joy to someone who has experienced such sadness is incredibly rewarding. I really liked your analogy of the shattered glass. I think you will find that some days you will be able to hold water and some days it will leak a little more than normal. Thank you for sharing your story. Even though were on different sides of the loss it is extremely helpful hearing what you have gone through. I appreciate you taking the time to provide your insight! ,GriefSupport,d9cdxig,3,t5_2s36e

9885456,0,t3_5fjs5o,Writing has helped immensely for me. Particularly writing here. Its a way for me to feel like Ive talked to somebody about it and also just get it out of my head and into the world. When Im having a particularly bad day I come here and I write a post. I write all the things in my head that I cant talk to my friendssupports about. I made the mistake of trying to confide in them and it makes things worse in the end. They get scared or worried about me when they hear whats in my head and they just dont know what to say or how to help understandably and I wind up feeling bad for dumping on them about it and making them uncomfortable.Ive learned that grief is almost like a taboo topic. Its something everyone experiences at some point in their life but nobody really talks about it to each other. We all kind of have to go through it on our own in a way.  Sure we have supports and counsellors and therapists and all that but its a journey we take alone its something we have to learn to manage and navigate. Thats the scariest part. ,GriefSupport,daw3jz3,2,t5_2s36e

10178163,0,t1_dbxqp5c,I think forgiveness is probably the best strategy ...life is too short for anything else.  I cant help but see them differently though ...like the kind that arent going to be there for me.,GriefSupport,dbxr1lq,2,t5_2s36e
10273134,0,t1_dc7qrf2,Absolutely right in that death brings out the worst in people! I think its too early to forgive but knowing my track record I will probably do so one day. I have just never felt so appalled before. This is definitely stopping me from grieving my mum but I do wonder whether I am just avoiding facing up the reality she has died focusing rather on my sister and her betrayal. Or perhaps Im just over thinking it. Thank you for responding  I really do appreciate it xx,GriefSupport,dc8ikvp,1,t5_2s36e

10584961,0,t1_dd4njf5,The therapists may not have been a good fit for you.  A skilled therapist that is a good fit will often be able to help guide you to understanding or identifying why you carry your grief in the way that you do.  Sometimes you can better cope with a loss if you understand the why behind your unique feelings.  ,GriefSupport,dd7r9uy,1,t5_2s36e

11534329,0,t3_64mqxx,Its really really hard to lose your mother so young and suddenly. Plus it sounds like youve had a lot of responsibility with her affairs and her home. No wonder that youre in a dark place now. Sounds like the full force of your mother dying is really hitting you now. It may feel like its been a long time but its only been a few months. Id encourage you to be kind and patient with yourself. This is really hard. You do wonder how you can find a life without her. Did I mention its really hard?? Try to take it day by day and even moment by moment. Try to reach out to others they miss your mom too. Stay strong and be yourself. ,GriefSupport,dg3f2ow,7,t5_2s36e
11598399,0,t1_dg5mf4n,Thank you for saying that. Her loss definitely made me understand how tomorrow is never promised. I try and be the best mom I can and I cherish every moment I get with my son. I am seeing a grief counselor.,GriefSupport,dgaoqv4,1,t5_2s36e
