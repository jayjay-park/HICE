6088864,0,t3_3yw3ph,This issue is caused by a recent Microsoft update.  I am still trying to isolate the exact update causing the issue.  I have noticed this happens on PCs with Adobe Reader .  Foxit users were not affected.  KEYgtgt Use system restore to date prior of .  If you dont have control panel shortcut accessible via Start Menu normally that is not working on desktop try this right click on bottom toolbar choose toolbars address bar type control panelenter to open.  When it open choose in upper right cornerview by to SMALL iCONS and choose RESTORE to date stamp prior to .  This will remove newly installed apps and warn you with popup if that is issue.  You can reinstall them if needed.Once fixed go thru PC and make sure all drivers up to date.  I also believe this issue may be related to Adobe ReaderWin so you may want to uninstall Reader for Nitro or FoxiT for PDF view.  Last step disable Windows Update service in Services area.  Hit working start buttontype services find windows update svc and change start up type to disable.  Reboot. Please note I do recommend turning this back to Automatic once Microsoft finds a solution.,TechnologyProTips,cyhq7vc,3,t5_37fhk

6606377,0,t3_464o19,If you have an old router lying around you can install DDWRT firmware on it and make a repeater or repeaterbridge!! Its pretty easy and they have a great wiki for all things routermodem related. I prefer the repeaterbridge because its essentially a customisable super long and sensitive wifi antenna. I still prefer having a long Cat cable to my secondary router but at least that way I only have to deal with one inverse square law crippled wireless signal. It should accomplish what youre looking for wireless or wired. Check it out!! ,TechnologyProTips,d02nktm,1,t5_37fhk

If youre running out of RAM closing programs or getting more should help if youre running out of storage a larger or an additional HDDSSD should help. You can also try CCleaner to free up some space or WinDirStat to see of theres something taking up a lot of space. ,TechnologyProTips,ddxnx5t,8,t5_37fhk
