7731367,0,t3_4l6u6x,Hmm. I like it. Its good. They seem to have toned down the jazzfunk influences and toned up the prog and metal influences which is something Ive been hoping to hear from them since hearing their heavyass live shows. It doesnt blow me away like the first listen to Feed the Horses did but its more Thank You Scientist and they certainly havent gotten any worse. Looking forward to hearing the rest!,thankyouscientist,d3l02cl,3,t5_33phk

Somnambulist Feed your Horses Salesmans Guide and Mr. Invisible would all work really well. And Blood on the Radio for well ironys sake though youd have to cut a fair bit out of it. In fact I use this song to introduce people to the band.,thankyouscientist,dcc8z27,3,t5_33phk
