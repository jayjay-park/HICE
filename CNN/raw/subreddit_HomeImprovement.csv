I usually do this in the summer so it might sound weird now also if you dont have a valve to do this its not really appropriate.  Let the interior of the pipes dry for a day or two.  Then let them sit for about a week.  Then turn the water back on and look at the pretty brown water.    If you have rust in your pipes its just a matter of time until there is a failure.

208094,0,t1_cf24dut,Good answer. The whole house fan really has a different function than a ceiling fan in a room. The whole house fan is meant to be cut on for a short period of time to flush the house with outside air. The only situation I can think where it works is a summer day when you are out of the house and dont run air conditioning. During the day the house gets hot but when you get home the outside air has cooled off enough that its a good temperature for inside so you run the fan for an hour.I lived a year in a house that had one. I think we used it twice.,HomeImprovement,cf258k1,1,t5_2ql97

263527,0,t3_1x3apu,That is the wrong type of box to be used in that situation.  It will make the fixture stand off the wall and not allow the fixture to be watertight.  You need to replace that electrical box with something like this metal old work box  You will have to chisel out a piece of the brick to insert this type of box.  The hole will need to be just big enough to fit the main body of the box into the hole.  The ears on the box will keep the box from falling into the hole.  The little screw gizmos on each side of the box in the picture expand when tightened to keep the box from falling out of the wall.  You have to buy a box with the little gizmos on the sides.  The little gizmos can fall off so dont lose them.  Your box will be mounted horizontally. In your situation start your hole on the vertical mortar joint that is touching the hole in the wall the wire comes through. The boxes are the same width as bricks usually aremake sure this is correct if not mount the box vertically so your hole will span from the horizontal mortar joint at the bottom of the wire hole to the horizontal mortar joint about   above the wire hole.  The right hand side of your box hole will not fall on a mortar joint like the other three sides.  It will fall near the middle of a brick.  Use the box as a template and mark where the right side of the box will end.  Use a drillhammer drill if you have one  with a common size or so masonry bit. Swiss cheese a vertical line in the brick. Swiss cheese holes in the three mortar joints. Use a hammer and cold chisel and chisel out the hole for the box. The hole should only be big enough for the main body of the box to fit.  Remove wire and fixture bar from existing boxshould do this when you start the job to get the existing box out of the way and insert into your new metal old work box into the new hole.  Tighten the gizmos on either side of the box to hold the box in the wall.  Attach fixture bar to new box using  screws.  These are the same thread and diameter screws that hold on wall plates switches and outlets.  Not the size that hold things to the original round WP box. After you put up the fixture and it mounts against the wall apply some clear silicone to the top and both sides of the fixture so water wont run down the wall and into the fixture.  Video kinda like what you need to do.  He used that sporty flat bit you dont necessarily want to buy and he used a type of box that is not normally used in this situation.  There are probably better videos but that one was close enough.When you are doing all this you will be able to look inside the wall to see how the building is constructed.,HomeImprovement,cf82o0z,2,t5_2ql97

430717,0,t3_1yzqfs,You dont have to do any rewiring everything you need is right there in the box.There should have been at least  wires besides groundbare wire and you cant always trust wires to be what the color indicates they should be.Look at the picture of the outletswitch combo you posted. The wire that was connected to the silver terminal would be the neutral wire. The one that was connected to the gold terminal is the switched hot that sends power to the light. There may have been one or two wiresmost likely  on the black terminals these are going to be the always on hot wires. You will need a bit of extra wire and a couple wire nuts to make pony tails for the hot wires. Basically you want to take the wire in the box and add  short pieces of wire to it by connecting them with a wire nut. This is so you can connect the single wire to two different devices. Connect one hot to the gold line terminal on the outlet and on to either terminal on the switch. connect the neutral wire to the silver line terminal on the outlet and connect the switched hot wire to the other terminal on the switch. If theres ground do the pigtail thing again to hook it up to the switch outlet and box if it metal. You should be good to go.,HomeImprovement,cfpeq3w,1,t5_2ql97

Then yea you could use deck screws to attach everything. But since thats not ever going to happen lets think about it like this. Houses settle every house when that happens then the screws sheer and instead of a little drywall repair now you are looking at extensive damage. Also wood moves what if a house gets rained on for a week before the roof is on? When the wood dries you are going to see screws sheer.  And floors are engineered to have movement.

If your compressor doesnt have a pressure regulator valve it may be easier to install one instead of monkeying with the pressure controls.,HomeImprovement,cj4fs4i,2,t5_2ql97

1538814,0,t1_cj8zu3p,Thats generally true about lighter walls and ceilings but a striking rich color is also really inviting even if you do it on one wall. You definitely sacrifice a feeling of spaciousness but a contrasting wall color to your favorite accent color can make everything pop Like a teal or blue contrasting to burnt orange baby blue and brown etc. Check out a color design website about how to choose colors from the color wheel if you havent had an art class on it. Not everyone has a natural grasp on which colors go well together. Dark or light floors...eh...Id go with your preference there. I would go out looking first. Checkerboard tiles laid diagonally can make a room look bigger and are supereasy to install. But theyre kind of busy not everyone likes that. Does give a s modern feel which you may or may not like.

1634230,0,t3_2d0lxa,If you have equity in your home you can get a home equity line of credit from your bank or credit union most are offering a low rate but also a free appraisal during the application process. I would think that if you went this route of applying you could probably talk to the appraiser when they visit some about the specifics of your community as they will use comparables recently sold homes and if they are good they will know what you might want to focus on where you live. Its not a consultation but if youre there and nice and all people are generally helpful. Theyll also need to know all the good things youve done to the house that you think are important to be sure they are considered even if they arent worth that much to the overall impression.For example  adding on to your home to add a bedroom would not add that much to the value BUT at least where I live having a closet and a window in a room can let a room be counted as a bedroom thats a different approach than carpet or paint which are easy and important if your particular market is big with growing families. Another thing to consider might be that some weird room layout or awkward door or something would be better to fix  not so much VALUE but making the home appealing. Or if all the comparable homes around you have nice kitchens and yours doesnt and you think a buyer wouldnt want to replace that then that might help prioritize.You can use realtor.com and zillow.com to search for recently sold properties that are very similar to yours nearby maybe in the same school district if yours is better than other suburbs. Pretend you were your potential buyer and how would you compare what you think your home is worth and your features with those others? Its not really that easy because there are so many factors and I wouldnt make a decision of what to improve based on that but its a good exercise given the questions youre asking...Some things dont add value per se but would make your house stand out when someone is buying a home and comparing yours to others  so you might sell in  weeks vs  months. I have a large pond at my house and appraisers consider it more of a beauty item not more value than a pool. But I still think for a buyer this one has a huge pond and so theres that. Time to sell is really important and keeps you from getting the next home you want if you cant predict when you get to move  thats a big issue.

If partitions are moving MEPs changing or being added Id get an Architect.If you get an Arct ask them who they have worked with in the past.

You have to be VERY careful. Only step on the ceiling support beams NOT go walking in between the supports or you will find a quick and expensive way to dismount from the attic. Im not sure the protocol or standards for blown insulation thickness as it related to R value but if you only keep to the support beams youll be ok.

As for retaining walls codes around here only apply to four feetplus masonry structures so there is no help there.  Also given the way the fence is facing your neighbor could argue it is his fence.  Anyhow I am not sure why my response got downvoted.  Ive done something similar before and it wasnt because I was stupid I just wanted my lot to drain properly.

My neighbor didnt like it but it was my fence and my property and I was tired of his gutters turning my backyard into a pond.

2574026,0,t3_2p8i6q,If youre changing all of the outlets anyway this is pretty easy.  First identify which outlets are on which circuits by flipping breakers on and off and testing.  Work on one circuit at a time.  Then turn the power off remove every outlet and position the neutral and hot wires in such a way that they can be tested with a volt meter.  Neutral bundles can remain connected but all black wires should be separated.  Make sure no kids or pets are around and turn the power back on.  Now carefully test each hole where their used to be an outlet.  The only one that can have power at this point is the first one.  Put your GFCI there and reinstall new outlets everywhere else.However be aware that some circuits have lights and those are possibly in the middle of circuits with outlets.  GFCI protection is not recommended for lights especially in rooms bathrooms and kitchens where a sudden loss of lighting could be dangerous due to potential for slips or touching hot surfaces.  In fact its specifically against code to GFCI protect bathroom lighting at all.  So pay attention to lights and try to install GFCI after lights.  If lights are in the middle you can do it right by adding one GFCI outlet for each light in the middle situation and installing lights on line terminals and then adding a new GFCI on the first outlet after each group of lighting.To clarify.  If you luck out and all of your lights and outlets are on separate circuit you just do thisbreaker box gt GFCI outlet load terminalgt outlet gt outlet gt etc.Similar is if lights are firstbreaker box gt lights gt GFCI outlet load terminalgt outlet gt outlet gt etc.If lights are in the middle or at the end you have more of a problem.  The only way to protect outlets without turning off everything down stream including lights is to install each GFCI with the down stream branches on the line terminal.  That means you need one GFCI outlet per outlet which gets pricy.  More likely youll just want to be careful in the bathroom and kitchen careful as in careful not to GFCI protect lights there... not careful when the lights go out!,HomeImprovement,cmukack,2,t5_2ql97

Have you done something like this before?One of the first things youll want to look at once you have the structural work finished and are ready to commit to the project is making sure your roof is good to go.  An unsound roof can allow all of your other work to be damaged and thats just not good.Electrical work is far easier than you think it is and can absolutely be done without paying for an electrician.  What you will want a pro to come in for is connecting the breaker box  but everything else is easy and quick.I would however recommend that you hire some labor to help you with the demolition.  Its hard dirty work that can take a lot longer for one guy to do than you might expect.  It can also be very demotivating as it drags on  and meanwhile many hands make light work. Insulation is another place where pros are well worth it they can get your insulation installed way faster than you and their bill at the end of the day will be less than the cost of the raw materials would have been had you bought them yourself.Last tip familiarize yourself with a CAD program like Sketchup.

Personally unless the branches were in a position to fall on his house and damage it I wouldnt even have a conversation with him.

Its probably not code but it wont burn down the place.The other wires in the rats nest in picture  may not be connected to anything.  The house appears to have a mixture of older and newerish wiring so its possible and probable that whoever did the wiring updates just left the old stuff in save them a step.  It appears to me that there maybe was an old panel or fuse box located on that board in picture .  When they moved the fuse box they disconnected the old wiring on both ends left it in place and pulled new wiring.  Again thats just what it appears like to me Im not there so I cant say  grains of salt.If you really want piece of mind follow the lines to see if both ends are open.  You can also buy a noncontact voltage detector at most if not all home improvement type stores for under  dollars.  This will tell you if the circuit is live or not.  If the exposed wires are dead then its more ok than if they were live.Im not a home inspector nor do I know the code for your area but it is very likely that the water heater install is not to code and possibly not permitted If you want to dig further you probably can look up the permit history of the property figure out when the water heater was made based on the tag and check to see if there was a permit issued that has a logical date for that install.   In my county permits have a short description for their intent so you can see if it was or was not permitted.  No permit no inspection not ok.You have good reason to get an inspector out already and have him check on your other concerns while hes there.

Again with an old heater I could be wrong although it would surprise me  they just plopped it into a stud wall so it cant be too dangerous. Newer ones have a temperature sensor that shut it down in case of overheating. I hope it has one of those too.Another issue is that the heater housing itself is certainly not air tight so sealing the gap around it is probably not enough. I would remove the heater from the wall seal all of its seams and holes including where the wires enter and then put it back in and seal the perimeter gap in the photo.I would probably use HVAC foil tape for the flat seamsholes on the housing and to seal the perimeter gap and some silicone caulk to seal any oddly shaped holes like where the wires go into it.,HomeImprovement,cpausv2,2,t5_2ql97

3421372,0,t3_2zepoe,If the AC is in the attic your highest priority assuming youre not willing to relocate it should be to seal the ducts and insulate them. AC in the attic is incredibly inefficient but that also means you can get the biggest gains with the smallest work by improving it. Next priority air seal the attic floor. Only after that should you put more insulation in the attic and cellulose would be a much better choice than fiberglass batts. Radiant barrier is also a dubious product with questionable payback. The insulation contractor looks like a bit of a hack. If you want to improve your envelope get an energy audit done by an energy auditor who is certified by BPI or Resnet.Replacing the AC obviously needs to happen regardless. Just keep in mind that the AC units should be sized AFTER any weatherization work is done otherwise they will likely be oversized and will not dehumidify nearly as well especially during mild warm weather.

3505494,0,t3_30f4wb,If you have high indoor humidity gt during springsummerfall then I would not expect to see much improvement from insulation or air sealing. You need to either run the AC or a dehumidifier to wring more water out of the air. But air sealing and insulation are important for energy consumption and comfort.If you have high indoor humidity in the winter then you probably have a major source of moisture in the house such as a damp crawlspace that lacks a vapor barrier missingfaultyunused bathroom fans or missingfaultyunused range fan. High indoor humidity in the winter will cause a dampmoldy attic when you dont have the attic air sealed because that indoor holds a lot of moisture and when it reaches the cold attic it hits its dew point and dew forms in the attic. Air sealing the attic is the best solution to this. Many people focus on attic venting but thats less important.Keep in mind that attic ventilation and attic air sealing are very different things. You want the attic vented to the outdoors but air sealed from the indoors. This makes the attic essentially an outdoor space.Ideally you should encapsulate your crawlspace which is sort of the opposite  you put an air barrier and vapor retarder on the floor and walls of the crawlspace and make it essentially just another indoor conditioned part of the house like a really short basement. This is the best thing to do when crawlspace dampness is a problem which is most of the eastern half of the US and some of the western half too.,HomeImprovement,cprungy,5,t5_2ql97

The yellow plug might be an access for a plumbing or sump drain. To the right of that plug is a steel form clip with a large crack running up the foundation. The bottom looks bad as well.I guess it could all be scrubbed and cleaned open the cracks with a cold chisel corner bottom and the one above the clip. Get the clip washer out. Remove the yellow plug. Fill it all with hydraulic cement and coat the whole thing with drylock. Leave it open and keep an eye on it for a few weeks. If it remains dry you got away cheap.It could be a problem that demands a whole lot more work though. Trenching the outside perimeter and doing a foundation drain system. .

It takes a little bit of thought but you can save yourself a lot of money. My advice is to you is to put down some foam underlayment over your countertop. Tape it so it can stay and you can work in an area with a little less stress of scratching the surface of your top. It is easy but you are reaching for almost all of the project and especially in the corners. Take your time and I would use a grout additive or grout that doesnt need sealed. It is  extra but it is worth not having to reseal your grout. Thats invalid if you work with travertine since it by nature is pourous.Also pull out your outlets and use box extensions. Make sure the extensions you get work with that type of box. Some stores have plastic ones that work with metal boxes others need modified. Plan ahead. As far as price it is high but some people are willing by to pay it. Your subway tile may have the build in spacing. Just make sure you get a good line to start from and you should do well. I would get pre mixed thinset instead of a bag mix. The premix works a little nicer but is kinda smiley when wet so have a rag hhandy to keep a clean hand.  Also after a few hours use a toothpick to clean the grout line before it fully hardens.Any other thoughts just ask.

4155718,0,t3_38apbv,Sound proofing is one of the more difficult projects. Sound is sneaky and travels through tiny gaps quite easily. So you not only need to decouple the floor or ceiling but you also need to hermetically seal any gaps in the walls that sound travels through.If done well this makes a huge difference. But its pricey and really not something that can be done by a renter.I recently sound proofed the floor between two rooms. All the work happened from below by opening the ceiling in the lower room and removing all existing sheet rock. The joist bays were then filled with fiber glass batting mostly for heat insulation not for sound. RC channel was attached to the bottom of the joists. This allows hanging sheet rock that is entirely decoupled from the joists. The channels sit on rubber feet.Instead of regular sheet rock the ceiling was closed up with special soundproof greenrock. And special soundproofing caulking was used around all ceiling and wall penetrations.The result is amazing.

With the only venting at the top of the attic there will be a very weak stack effect and most of the attic air will be bypassed undisturbed your ventilation will be largely dependent upon wind forces.This is not necessarily a problem or a very big one. The air sealing and insulating you did is far more important for maintaining appropriate attic conditions.Whether you need soffit vents to not void the shingle warranty depends upon your shingle warranty. There is no scientific evidence to support that attic ventilation has any impact on shingle life but that hasnt stopped it from being included in shingle warranties in the past.The attic hot spots warning is likely true.

First the Supreme Court case you are citing pertains to refuse placed at a curb for pickup and does not extend to refuse not yet placed out for collection. The court made a very clear distinction between the two. Second dependent upon state law it is absolutely criminal trespassing to proceed beyond a sign posting No Trespassing. You dont even need the sign in some circumstances for instance in Illinois we can use purple colored hashes set at certain distances they mean the same thing. Third should you take something from the dumpster again assuming its not set out for collection you could be prosecuted for theft if the renter  leasee chooses to sign a complaint. The reason being the person could be planning to sell the scrap located within the container and you taking it deprives him of his profits. Additionally many municipalities have local ordinances specifically banning such actions. Im not saying dont dive but I would review your laws before doing it. ,HomeImprovement,cs4hnzn,9,t5_2ql97

Cut and thread a piece of  rigid pipe the right length to screw into floor flanges mounted on the wall but it has to be all made up before installing. Cut a polished aluminum or stainless shower rod to slide over the rigid pipe. Make this all up and screw it to the wall above the tile using long stainless steel screws. Get a sturdy twopiece shower curtain and put it on the rod with stainless steel shower curtain S hooks. That will give them something sturdy to grab if they lose their balance when theyre in the shower or getting in or out of the tub. Usually when that happens they panic and reach out and grab the nearest thing which is usually the shower curtain but most arent strong enough to hold them up. I did this for my motherinlaw  and my father  and so far they havent had to use it but its there in case of an emergency.Im assuming they have handrails in the shower with a chair a regular metal folding chair works better than the plastic shower chairs and so far they havent rusted and a holder for the shower head lower down on the wall.Also if they have trouble getting in or out of the shower you can have the tub cut down to make it easier.

Our new construction leaked in the first heavy rain. Old houses have quirks but you learn to live with them.  Sure our roof leaked this winter... But it didnt collapse. The stairs are creaky but theyre not separating from the walls.  The joists are undersized but theyre made of some pretty old wood that has no rot or insect damage. The house has stood for this long. Its unlikely that it will fall anytime soon....that said we basically have to replace all of the electrical and plumbing and repair the roof and the front facade.

Contractors by the large arent as picky as homeowners are or the contractor cantisnt there at every step and phase of the building process so shoddy work has a high chance of being swept under the rug so to speak.You have higher chances of bad framing poor taping on AC ducts many things being out of square tile work not properly set stucco that cracks more than needed windows that are hard to open doors that rub etc etc.While everything is generally higher quality and built to better code the actual installation quality in new homes especially track homes can be very shoddy.Not to mention you have to remember that everything goes to the lowest bidder youre getting the fastest cheapest work possible  times out of a hundred. The workers are being rushed and hurried.This is the largest problem with new home building IMO. This can lead to a very nice new home that has many small problems that can potentially lead to warranty frustrations.Example My sister in law purchased a new home built about  years ago. They have had to have companies come out and fix their sliding door which is out of square and closes poorly a frameless shower door which started to rub the tile because of bad clamping stucco that cracked in many places and poorly installed AC ducts that are needing to be redone.They are obviously extremely frustrated to have purchased a brand new home only to have to continuously deal with all these issues.Quality will vary from builder to builder.,HomeImprovement,ct2v44g,3,t5_2ql97

It may cost an extra hundred dollars to get an engineer to do the math but if your code dept is up to speed once they see that there is a load bearing wall coming out they will want to see some math on what will replace it.  If the contractor hides that fact to save you money then you are dealing with a shitty contractor who just lied on a legal document.  Spend the money to get it done right the first time.

5316839,0,t3_3ns9h0,Not really an answer to your question but I like keeping the hot water cranked up to F.  It makes it super easy to quickly sanitize knives and cutting boards etc. in the sink without getting out the bleach.  Between a quick pass with the sponge and a hot water rinse for s you are pretty effectively sanitizing any nonporous surface.  Also in a tankless system its not like you are spending oil to keep  gallons of water constantly at F or anything.  Sure you will use less oil if you turn it down but at least it is an on demand system.  I assume your heating is hot water baseboard through the same boiler?  If so its really neither here nor there in terms of heating efficiency.  Youll lose a few more joules pumping to the farthest pipes but all that heat should go into the house anyway.,HomeImprovement,cvraejv,2,t5_2ql97

5335544,0,t1_cvtnbw1,okay. lets talk about Quartz Clocks vs  year old Mechanical Clocks.if you put a weak battery or faulty regulator on a quartz clock the time will not be accurate. if you mess with the weightsspringsgear ratios on a mechanical clock the same can happen. the quartz be interfered with electronically but a mechanical clock can be disturbed in a heavy storm or mild earthquake.both need people to define a reference to set and make them accurate. that reference is someone arbitrary like someone starting a map with HERE at time NOW. This is how surveying works. it takes a static precise snapshot of a place at that time. its not linked to the outside world until we need to link it.GPS isnt fast nor is it as accurate for surveying work unless some extra steps are taken even then people break out the total station to get it done right. GPS has to sit on a spot for a long time to be really accurate about that location. So long that i could have s of points logged in a local shoot ready to link when GPS finally accurately described where we are on the face of the earth to a few feet.you think the world runs on labgrade time? it doesnt. and its not as high a gold standard as you think. its about measuring things that take place on a minute scale for the sake of experiment. its not like anyone is using atomic timers to measure the minutes hours and days for practical reasons. they arent consistently accurate over that scale of time. the ones that are are themselves an experiment to improve our ability to examine time on more and more minute scales.time is as precise and accurate as we need it to be. there is no need for additional accuracy for anything other than lab research and those results are only statistically linked to real world applications. higher accuracy doesnt imply better results.surveying instruments havent gotten all that more accurate because we dont need them to be to do anything we use them for.,HomeImprovement,cvtoaxc,0,t5_2ql97

5812506,0,t1_cxhkhdx,It is likely  not what you want to hear that the tub is not installed properly. No way should it flex or move when you stand in it.I fi moves at all that means the caulk joints also move and they will fail.I have seen this many times.Many tubs are supposed to be set in a thin soupy mortar mix.  Their thin fiberglass or metal bottoms need this support.  Others have fins on the bottom to take some weight but others must have the mortar bed.  Once they are installed it is hard to tell unless you step in it.This will sound insane but there is a way to do it afterwards as long as you can get access to the underside of the tub through a closet or bedroom wall on any side.  Cut a good sized hole in the drywall based on the size of commonly available plastic plumbing access panels.  Get  a few of the large size expanding foams aerosols the type that expands a lot.  Using red Tuck tape securely attach a  length of rubber hose onto the nozzle of the foam can.   Tape it well.....  Tape  of the hose to a piece of small dowel.  Jam the hosedowel under the tub as far back as you can get it and fill the cavity under the tub with the expanding foam.  It will take  maybe  cans.  Youll have to replace the hose probably it tends to plug up.  Tape it well the pressure is great and if it comes off that foam is nasty and hard to get off things like carpets or yourself.It works the bottom of the tub is supported as designed and if your tub is fiberglass or acrylic it will prevent it from flexing and cracking which is catastrophic and basically unfixable..,HomeImprovement,cxhlgvx,2,t5_2ql97

5899912,0,t1_cxsrn18,Im a little confused but I just reread your post and I think I understand a little better. Sounds to me like you have an external tank oilfired hot water heater AND an oil fired furnace. Id also bet that the copper coil coming from the furnace to the hot water heatertank is the oil feed the line that delivers oilfuel to your hot water heater. Is it small diameter? Do you have any photos? Can you trace the line from your oil tank to the furnace and then see the same line split or T off and continue on to your hot water heater? I would say its time for a new hot water heater probably ASAP. That said Im not a licensed plumber or HVAC guy. I used to manage about  winter rental properties for staff housing at a resort area. I have some experience with hot water heaters and usually when there is brown rust in the water its only a matter of time until it lets go your hot water heater starts leaking and can flood your house. Time to learn about your new home quickly. Trace the oil feed line coming from the oil tank to the furnace and the hot water heater. As the homeowner you should know where it is and it will help you understand how the oil fired heating devices are fed. Next look for the water shutoff valves both at the home coming in from the street and feeding into the hot water heater. Just like the oil feed line trace the water coming in from the street all the way through to a faucet both hot and cold. The shutoff valves should be  valves if they are parallel with the pipe they are ON if they are perpendicular to the pipe they are OFF. A hot water heater is a simplestupid device with one sensor controlling the ONOFF setting a temperature gauge. When the water inside the tank gets below a certain temp the heater turns on when the water is heated up the heater shuts off. Thats it. Your water system is pressurized thats why you have pressure at the sink so when you turn on the hot water faucet hot water comes to you from the tank. The hot water is replaced by cold water which then dilutes the hot water causing the temperature to drop and the heater turns on. Usually the internal heating coils are cast iron or steel not copper. Copper is pretty soft and doesnt do all that well with being heated with a blowtorch repeatedly. You probably have four copper pipes attached to your hot water heater a small oil feed line a bigger water in pipe probably  or  a hot water out pipe same diameter as the water in pipe and a pressure blow off valve pipe should lead to a bucket drain or sump pump. The rust you are probably experiencing is the heating element inside your water tank starting to rust and degrade. Ifwhen that cracksbreaks water will leak out and not stop until it is shut off up stream of the tank. You could also have black pipe in your house that water is flowing through but unless you have a LOT of it its unlikely that the rust would keep coming back over and over. The reoccurring rust is usually from the expansion and contraction of the heating element inside the hot water heater. As the oil heater turns on amp off its almost like a blowtorch heating a hunk of metal. What you are experiencing is fairly common if the house has been vacant. Sorry for the long post hope it helps. ,HomeImprovement,cxt0g0x,1,t5_2ql97

Cat will allow for Gigabit speeds Gbps over your network assuming your router is capable of that speed. If not when you upgrade your router you wont need to upgrade your cabling too. Its worth the few extra bucks to not have to fish cables again.Id probably swap out that port wall plate for a port one just so you can run another device in the future even if you dont run a th cable now leave it open and leave a pulling cord in the run so you can pull another one later if need be.EDIT Advantage of running an extra cable you can get a cheap WiFi access point and plug it into that port to extend WiFi coverage if that area of your house has poor coverage.

The right sealant for threaded joints is nonhardening compatible with plastic and doesnt add slipperiness.gtA nonhardening compound is forced by water pressure into potential points of leakage thereby performing a true sealing function. Tapes and hardening pastes permit a leak path to develop when a joint is backed off mechanically flexed or expands with rising temperatures. gtA sealing compound must be compatible to plastics. Many brands of pipe sealant contain oils solvents or carriers that can damage plastic. A proper sealant must be certified by the manufacturer to be harmless to the fitting material and to not contaminate fluid in the pipe.gtFinally a sealing compound must not lubricate the joint to the point that overtightening is encouraged.

The contractor literally provided a ton of stuff to the lender as well as signed his own series of contractspaperwork with OPs lender saying he was going to do this by the book.  The nice thing is I think that process screwed his contractor.OP should seek another candidate contractor however OP AND his lender have to fire the first contractor and the LenderConsultant will work to mediate this issue or come to the resolve its time for dude to go.

You may see them outside and crawling around the outside of the house. They eventually drop their wings and settle down. If you see one or two inside it could have come in from outside. You need to make sure your house is sealed up and there are no openings in your attic soffits. If you see more than that find them on window sills find wings or find little piles of frass then you have a problem. That means the swarmers are trying to GET OUT of your house to start a new colony. In that case youve probably been infested for  years and need to tent the house. You should get an exterminator.

As for how much juice the tool is a multimeter with an amp probe on it  a round open part on the top that can be opened and clamped around a wire and it will tell you the amount of current going through it. If you wanted to know the amount of current amps you simply clamp the amp probe around one of the hot wires and read the current with the lights on. Whichever wire has  lights will read double the current of the other two. However youll have to let the lights fully warm up to get to the accurate current draw and this could take  minutes of holding in the test button.If youre interested in getting an amp probe Id recommend this one Its on the cheap end of reliable meters has a light up screen which is very handy has a temperature probe which is useful every once and a while set your fridge exactly....

6848232,0,t3_49hdtz,So you have a couple of issues going on here. It would be easy if you didnt have to think about moisture but the reason you have less moisture accumulation in your basement the higher up you go is because the heat from your house dries it up most likely. If you insulate the ceiling then you might get a buildup of too much moisture. So then it might be prudent to make sure you basement is well ventilated. Someone mentioned the idea of insulating the basement walls rather than ceiling. This is usually the most commonly accepted approach but only after the source of moisture in the basement is treated. You say you have rising damp but is that all it is? No standing water? If it is just rising damp bringing the basement into the conditioned space might be fine as the increase in temperature in the basement will help the basement keep dry. But then you have to be careful about how that moisture travels through the rest of your house by making sure you have adequate air changes recommended approximately  air changes per hour blower door tests can confirm this. Either path you choose make sure that the insulation is installed with a proper air barrier. Note that air barriers are different than vapor barriers. Building science has been shifting to favor air barriers over vapor barriers because far more moisture travels through air than through building materials. Also uhistpresarchitect is sort of contradicting himself as most board insulation polyisocyanurate xps eps are air barriers so it doesnt matter what you wrap it with air would still be arrested around it. But as far as reversible materials go sure boardinsulation is good. I would recommend either a rockwool insulation between the joists and than covering the joists or replacing the ceiling with  inches of polyisocyanurate sheetboard insulation and then sealing that tight to the perimeter of the basement. You could build a ceiling over that if you wanted. But then I would keep track of the moisture levels in the basement as they are likely to elevate now that its colder.,HomeImprovement,d0sjyia,2,t5_2ql97
6848726,0,t3_49kjjo,Its possible that its condensate from the roof tiles or leaking through connection points for the tiles screw holes etc or perhaps the mold is growing in areas with slightly less air circulation as you can see its more densely populated where the roof tiles come into contact with the wood structure. It could be moisture coming up through the ceiling lights particularly if you take hot showers or do not have a ventilation fan in the bathroom.Im not familiar with tiled roof construction and I assume most americans arent either as they arent popular in most areas in Canada and the US.  I would suggest getting in touch with a professional.,HomeImprovement,d0slz6j,1,t5_2ql97

6849755,0,t3_49layd,gtIf I recall correctly there only needs to be one GFCI outlet on the circuit as long as it is upstream closer to the breaker than the other outlets assuming all  outlets are on the same breaker. Am I right in this thinking?Yes provided the downstream outlets are connected to the load side of the GFCI.gtIf so how would I determine which outlet is closest to the breaker and would be the appropriate location to put a GFCI if I were to just install ?Assuming theyre all on the same breaker easy to determine and on the same leg of the breaker not off a junction box somewhere you can either take each apart and check for continuity between wires or trial and error by swapping out the outlets and testing.  What would help you get started is if you could see where the wires are coming from in either your basement or attic. Alternative is install a GFCI breaker at the panel.Either way standard outlets would then need to be labelled as GFCI protected with the stickers that come with GFCIs.,HomeImprovement,d0sq6o3,2,t5_2ql97

6864173,0,t3_49qukp,Most likely the service panel manufacturer has gone out of business which means that the home cannot be brought up to code NEC for electrical in most jurisdictions. That means if you want another outlet ran or remodel something youll need to bring the panel up to code at the same time. Two reasons come to mind off hand for not meeting code . Circuit Breaker brand must match service panel manufacturer to ensure that the item in question is designed for the box. . Every outlet not in the bathroom or garage must be on an arc fault AFCI breaker and bathroomskin area of kitchen require GCFI. If the box manufacturer went out of business such as Federal Pacific then you would never be able to add an outlet let alone find replacement breakers to comply with code. Yes I am aware that these are made by American and Connecticut Electric however many city inspectors will not accept anything but the brand of the service panel inside the box. Federal Pacific had their UL listing pulled because of bad testing procedures which led to a good amount of fires. Neighbors sister in law lost their home to a massive fire caused by the Federal Pacific service panel last year.    Most homes built between  and  have a Federal Pacific panel.  With a A service your stove might be at the top of the breakers amp load and the lightsoutlets are most likely on amp when more and more jurisdictions are adopting the latest NEC stating amp in kitchen and laundry.

Most all mortars before then were mixed onsite by hand with whatever lime and sand were available locally.  Bricks were often locally or regionally sourced as well.Old bricks were usually made without holes and fired at lower temps this makes for a weaker inside and requires softer lime mortar in order to prevent cracking as the building moves.Newer bricks have holes and are fired at high temps making for a tough brick.  Their hardness allows them to be used with muchharder portland cement mortars.  The whole brick wall stays put but you need expansion joints for house movement otherwise everything starts cracking.On old brick and lime mortar you MUST use lime mortar.  Portland mortar will not allow the building to move and will crack and spall your bricks.P.S. Lime mortars were mixed onsite with what was available so there are millions of recipes out there making historic brick restoration quite a complex project.,HomeImprovement,d10tqrb,1,t5_2ql97

Labor per window was displayed removal and disposal everything. When I asked about the cost of the bigger windows he laughed. He told me the difference in cost of materials was so negligible that they dont charge any more or less for any size of your basic doublehung. Obviously very large picture windows were listed separately with a different price.They didnt pressure with any limited time offers like the other  did either.

7124641,0,t3_4d57mh,Steam showers are absolutely awesome and a wonderful addition to your bathroom. But they do require a bit of planning to make them work properly. Here are some of the details that I remember You should get a steam generator that is sized properly for the space that you are filling with steam. Thermasol makes excellent quality steam generators and their website has a calculator that tells you which generator you need. In most houses the steam generator cant be placed directly next to the shower e.g. because of required clearance and because of required accessibility for servicing. Thats OK. You can run steam for a good distance as long as you use insulated pipes. You must follow the manufacturers instructions though on how to route the pipe. It can only have a single rise from the generator and from then on out it must have a continuous drop until it terminates in the shower. Bad things happen if you dont follow these instructions very carefully. The steam outlet must be at the bottom of the shower stall. There are guidelines on where it should be positioned so that you dont scald the occupant. Steam is obviously quite hot and when it comes out it gets hot anywhere in the close vicinity of the outlet. Your shower stall must be fully enclosed. Letting the steam escape into the rest of the bathroom is a recipe for disaster. Youll inevitably have mold corrosion and electrical problems. Your bath room should have a good fan so that you can vent steam when you are done using the steam shower. Your shower stall should be big enough that you can install a bench. I personally prefer an oversized bench so that I can sit comfortably for at least min while enjoying the steam. Having a rain shower head in addition to a regular shower head is nice. But you should check local building codes some of them restrict having multiple shower heads in the same shower stall. Steam has a tendency to get everywhere. A normal shower stall is definitely not steam proof and youll end up having problems with rotting and molding walls. You must install a steam proof not just water proof! membrane that encloses the entire shower stall. KERDI would be a good option if installed properly. You could consider using kilndried lumber for building the shower stall that reduces the risk that settling causes cracks. All wall penetrations must be fully sealed with steam proof caulking. Consider using synthetic grouting material as it is less prone to developing mold. Use nonporous tiles. Natural stone including marble is a really bad choice. But modern tiles or manmade stone works pretty well. Building codes require a slanted ceiling in steam showers. You should doublecheck but I think it is something like  inch drop per  foot run. You need this so that condensation runs of nicely instead of constantly dripping on you think Chinese water torture. You probably want some type of lighting in the shower stall. Thermasol and a couple of other manufacturers make lighting fixtures that are steam proof. You should get those instead of buying cheap wetroom fixtures. The latter are not steam proof and will cause damage to your house.There are probably a few more considerations but the above should get you started on the right track.On the other hand if this is all too complicated you can instead buy a steamshowerinabox. Its a readymade unit that you simply move into your bathroom and hook up properly. It already takes care of all the complicated bits. It gives you a lot less flexibility but it certainly is much easier to install correctly.,HomeImprovement,d1nzmrt,15,t5_2ql97

Ive redeemed about as many as I can from the wonderful reddit store for merchandise and assorted trinkets.I dont know how it is where youre from but a well regarded handyman in my parts usually has a great amount of experience in construction likely specializing in specific areas of expertise.  Some retired. Others got layed off from their regular job and this is how they keep their lights on.Its not like these guys are hacks.  Ive used handymen for everything from plumbing to simple construction to cabinets and countertops.  Ive saved a lot of money that way and never once suffered any setback or loss of value because I didnt pay x the money for a certified person.I certainly know when I need a certified licensed XXXXX person but I use handymen when possible.  As long as they come highly regarded can secure any permits necessary and offer a reasonable price then thats a winwinwin for everyone.So yes I am being serious. I just dont think youve ever had a good experience with a handyman and thus your judgement is clouded.  My advice is neither bad nor irrelevant. No more than yours is.My post might be a textbook example of a downvote but if so only because Ive offered a point of view in a construction forum thats ruffled feathers of a bunch of overpriced contractors.

Most of the drawings etc can be done by yourself.  The reailty is that you are allowed to do your own work on the house if you pull your own permit.  A somewhat dishonest person might pull their permit on their own and then bring in the original contractor to help do the work up to code.Someone may correct me on this but a contractor being licensed and a contractor doing work by getting permits are  separate things.  A licensed contractor has gone through the proper channels of learning as an apprentice etc while an unlicensed contractor learned on their own or in an informal training plan.  I believe there is some sort of financial bonds and insurance that comes with licensed contractors as well.

Calcium drops out of solution to form scale increasingly with hotter temps so most of the scale is in your hot water heater. Also hard water is not very corrosion so your piping has actually been protected due to the saturated water already. You are making it more corrosive by softening it. If you have been draining your water heater you likely have been removing a lot of the calcium scale but if you havent you likely have scale in there and should just leave it until it dies.

It would be up to the new homeowner to have it pumped out on a regular basis.If that is the case then it would have to be pumped disconnected and perhaps filled in.  The term is abandoned in place.

7680618,0,t3_4kidtb,I am not a lawyer but involved deeply in construction management. Here is my recommendation  The larger issue is the delay of your builder. Many contracts place the burden of schedule on the contractor. Not sure what contract you using but typically you as owner would have a few rights in this situation. Either to bring in a third party with the right to back charge or liquidated damages on a per day basis probably not in the contract. What you need to do is carefully read the contract to understand your rjghts due to contractor delay. You would likely want to file an official notice again per the contract claiming delay per a specific provision of the contract with a prescribed timeframe to cure otherwise you begin your options to step in as owner. Bear in mind that in most construction agreements schedule is a contractor responsibility. If there is a delay caused by incorrect work or subcontractor scheduling that is their problem to resolve and typically does not allow an adjustment to the contract substantial completion date. You may also have rights to withhold payments and that would certainly get their attention. If you need help you could contact any construction lawyer but you may wish to try going in your own first and see if you get a positive response. Squeaky wheel gets the grease. ,HomeImprovement,d3f8neh,4,t5_2ql97

First treatment kills off the adults nd treatment kills off the eggslarvae if i recall correctly. A good way to track how infested your place is fill a plate with dish soap water turn off the lights in the infected area and shine a light on the plate.

Does it ignite quickly and does it reignite throughout the cycle when needed?In my experience this is caused by either a bad coil or bad valve. The coil gets electrified becomes magnetic and opens up the gas valve to call for gas. If it doesnt work right it cant open the valve enough and you get just a little gas leaking out. If its not that it could be the valve not working right. Both of these things can be caused by lint debris which is why I suggested cleaning if you can. It may be too late for that though.

My experience in renovatingflipping houses tells me that pretty much any modern window is a major upgrade from old aluminum or wood frame relicsthe films gases etc add cost do not greatly enhance already low R values that come with having an expanse of glass and tend to block light.the benefit does not come as much from a choice of double or triple glazing.  It comes from seals on the windowswhich are often camlocks here the style of window and from sealing around the window rough opening which is usually entirely neglected until recentlyso I generally buy double pane windows with no options and usually in casement or awning styles because they seal so much better than sliders or singledouble hung styles.  For me it is the best compromise between economy and performance.  Last year I did help a family member install basic triple pane full replacement windows.  The only reason he went triple was that he could get local govt  rebates that made the third pane basically free.And I avoid insert retrofits at all times.  Full replacement windows or dont bother!,HomeImprovement,d4u5suw,5,t5_2ql97

8144321,0,t3_4qrocy,I had a problem with my old DSL internet service...it worked but the speeds I got were way way below the service I was paying for.  My house was well beyond the distance where theyd guarantee anything and that was fine.  But I submitted a support ticket to ask if I could get the bill reduced to a lower rate package that more closely matched the actual service I was getting.A week went by with no response so I updated the ticket in their portal stating I was still awaiting a response.  another week and I posted another update to it.  This went on for a while once a week Id update with the ticket with Hello??  and Does anyone read these?? and one day I got an email notice that the ticket was closed resolved.I was briefly pleased but quickly realized the ticket was closed but nothing had been done to my account or service.  a day or so later I got a newsletter email from the company CEO which included his email address.  So I responded to him and gave him a link to the support portal ticket and asked please review this ticket and let me know if this is the level of support your company is committed to or some such thing.Next thing I know Im getting a phone call from their executive resolutions office.  they dispatched a tech to do a survey of the service at my house identified a wiring issue that I was able to correct and improve my service about x and they gave me some account credits.Long story but the moral is that complaining to the boss sometimes produces results.,HomeImprovement,d4vl3v3,18,t5_2ql97

I pay my licensed service techs a VERY good wage in a very low costofliving state anywhere from  an hour and we arent union plus VERY good bonuses no payperpart scams either! that bring their pay per hour over the year to much higher than that. We pay  of their health insurance and  for their spouse and children. We match  of their k. We offer an HSA. We pay part of their cell phone bill. Uniforms. They take their trucks home and dont have to pay for gas to and from work. We send them and their families on company paid week long vacations every th anniversary of their employment. We give not loan them money every year to upgrade or repairreplace tools. We pay for extra training. We drug test and do background checks on every hire we make including office staff so that before sending guys into someones home we can be as confident as we can possibly be that they can trust anyone we send.And that isnt even the tip of the overhead iceberg for a service company. We arent even a large business although in a business full of onemanshows we are bigger than many either.Treating my employees well so that I can be sure Im sending the best guys around to someones home year in and year out isnt cheap.

Automatic home generators usually run once a week or every two weeks on a timer just to keep fluids circulated and make sure it works when you need it.But further away is more costly to install involves digging a trench from your home to the generator.Best bet is to call your local building code enforcement and ask them for the regulations that will tell you what your options are.  As for what makes a good base gravel w cinderblocks or cement are probably good options.

Conversely when in cool mode it will usually blow the air straight out.They work great for us even mounted up high on the wall.

A roof like that is not easy to shingle and you need someone that knows to do it properly. This install tells me those doing it do not know what they are doing for that roof type. Dont expect any real warranty from the manufacture either based on those photos. Shingles are not flat overhanging gaps etc... Yea the trap was a warning sign but that install looks bad from those pictures. After that you might have to post at rlegaladvice ,HomeImprovement,d6zzkpg,59,t5_2ql97
8761085,0,t1_d70jab9,Homeowners . Check the contractors license have them provide proof of insurance and call their references on bigger jobs like this. Insist that they pull a permit unless they can prove that a permit isnt required. Have them sign a contract that includes partial payment upon certain milestones and a  hold back given to them only when theyve completed the job and properly cleaned up the site. In my state Mass if they pull a permit you can get reimbursed by a state trust fund if they screw up a job badly enough. But if you let them work without one you arent covered by the trust fund. I suspect you have just learned a very expensive lesson. But maybe if youre lucky youll be able to get them to make it right or at least refund whatever youve paid them.

But you need the deck to not be flat you want a runoff so the water will not pool you shoudl have had that with wood as well.As far as building a deck and cost materials for sub structure decking and railing are about the same adn then double to triple the material to pay for labor.  So was her K with labor?  If so you can guess that her material was perhaps K and the decking itself was K or so of that.  I know I have seen some compsites that were  a square foot and others as high as  per square foot.Replacing the decking should be an easy DIY task.  The hidden fastener systems make it pretty easy.  One fear is that composites need joists OC and many decks were built  OC with PT so that could be ab issue for you..  A few thoughts on the railing.

9015805,0,t3_5181ff,Hey! I have a few questions  First set of question is on windows and paint. Whats the deal with vinyl window warranties saying you shouldnt paint the exterior of the window?Does it matter? Do companies actually use paint on a window as a reason to void warranty. Does paint actually negatively impact the performance of a window as weve been told?For context Im in WA we just put a deposit down on an order for  windows all Milgards Styleline. The final measurements havent been done and the company we are working with says we still have a few days to change our mind about whether we want to pay an extra  !!! for a Milgard color or continue forward with the default white.Weve been told repeatedly by sellers not to paint the windows because it will void the warranty. This has been true for all of the window brands weve looked into. For Milgard specifically we have been told just to pay for one of Milgards prepainted options. Aside from the added price our sticking point is that the majority of our windows are original s Tudor styling with the diamondpatterned grilles leaded windows. All exteriors have been painted a deep dark ink blue that we love. Marvins closest color is a dark poop color. The company we went ahead with has said yes all of that is true the warranty could be void but theyve never actually seen it happen when its obvious the failure is something with the manufacturing. And the sales guy says he paints his own milgard windows when he has them installed as well. He was very clear that he did not want to pressure us one direction or another because he understands our concern but if you were my child  I would say paint them yourselfObviously  hes a sales guy. So hes trying to keep us happy. We went ahead with this company specifically because of him. Hes been the most honest and forthcoming with his opinions about what would be the best option for our home not the most expensive option... while still answering all of our questions and humoring us when we ask him to write up multiple estimates of the works so we can really understand what our options are.But I would still love to get a second opinion on this Here is the section from Milgards warranty on the topicgtEXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGEgtThis Warranty does not cover damage or defects relating to misuse abuse minor imperfections in glassthat do not affect the Products structural integrity or significantly obscure vision natural weathering ofexterior finishes acts of nature e.g. from fire hurricane etc. building settling structural failures of wallsor foundations improper installation handling storage or field mulling the use of applied tints or filmsalterations including but not limited to customerapplied finishesEDIT  Totally spaced  wanted to also say thank you your mega thread before helped us go ahead with Milgard as a manufacturer!

9247738,0,t3_56zia6,I redid the floors in my first house. It was pretty bad when I started. I zip walled rooms and rented a walk behind belt sander. That was probably tied at first with toughest part. Then I rented a large hand belt sander tied at first for toughest because the big motors that run them are kind of hard to control. Then I rented the pad sander that has  disks and walked it along the wood grain at   and  grit. I would go that much farther with the grit because the wood may not take stain. Then I used an oscillating sanding tool with a corner sanding pad on it to touch up edges and corners. Once I was satisfied with the sanding I used a tack cloth to get all of the sawdust up. Then I conditioned the wood using a pre conditioner. I then used a wiping stain. I went with two different shades to get what I liked. Be cautious walking through stained floors without a finish. I wouldnt even do it really. When I was ready for a polyurethane I used Fabulon I used a pour method and a lambs wool on a stick to pull and push my finish.

What style of cabinets how big a sink what fixtures do you like etc.This is just my impression.  It is partly based on my renovation.  Take it for what its worth.Your kitchen is too small.  I would remove two walls.  That little room in the back of the kitchen with the bookcases?  That is wasted space.  Id take the wall out completely.  Id also close off the window where the microwave is sitting but Id turn the other window into French doors leading to a patio or landing if possible.  In that room Id have a big reachin pantry on the bookshelf side and Id slide a new double door fridge where the microwave is at.  Then Id center the stove on the wall that backs the stairs with new cabinetry on either side and a hood vent that really works.The wall that is empty that separates the dining area from the kitchen?  Its got to either go completely which would be best or get cut down to bartop height.  Id like to see a big island right about there with plenty of room for chairs.  You could be cooking and your guests could be sitting there talking about how great your renovations came out.

9280883,0,t1_d8scar8,I havent worked with this stuff but have been thinking about doing so. I have a few questions if you dont mind. If this is sprayed on a concrete wall moisture from the air cant get to the wall and settle to promote mold growth. But would it also prevent moisture from seeping through the concrete from outside? So none can get in there because there are no gaps right? Assume you took a situation like the OPs second pic with a wall studded out. Theres areas where the stud is up against the concrete where the foam may not reach is that potentially a trouble spot where moisture is trapped against the wood and would eventually lead to rot? Would it be better to turn those studs sideways so that the foam could fill in behind them? I have a house about  years old. Half the basement is paneled and there doesnt seem to be anything back there. I dont really want to pull down the paneling and sheetrock it. But I would like to insulate someday. The link you gave includesgtgtFoam it Green Slow Rise spray foam seals and insulates closed walls with no insulation.  Its the only slow rise formula in the world that is antimicrobial and fire retardant.  The unique blueyellow  green fool proof color indicator helps ensure you fill your walls with properly mixed foam.Does this mean I can insulate the walls without removing the paneling from the gaps over the top of it? How do you do that? The upstairs of the house has insulated walls from construction but the type of insulation they used at the time is from what I can tell essentially useless now due to deterioration and sagging. Can that stuff be sprayed in those wall spaces now? ,HomeImprovement,d8sf38r,1,t5_2ql97

I usually do because I have zero interest in doing this job twice.Once the weeping tile is in I then apply a thick coating of asphalt emulsion to the foundation.  I then lay geomembrane against the emulsion so that if the foundation cracks or moves it is still sealed. Then I apply a second coat of emulsion.  Finally a sheet of plastic is laid against the asphalt.  If Ive installed a weeping tile I attach dimple board to the foundation to direct the water down to the tile system.NOTE  There are newer products available to do this.  I am old school.  This is how I was taught.  Others may do it differently.

9853403,0,t1_darurfc,it works better in a vacuum but that does not mean it will not work in a home. I am not saying it is worth the cost.There are three different types of heat. Conduction convection and radiation. Convection is the movement of air that has different temperatures. Conduction is the transfer of heat between two touching objects and radiation is the transfer of heat via electromagnetic rays.  In space there is a vacuum so there cannot be conduction or convection. And foil is great at reflecting electromagnetic rays so it works great for insulation. Well in a home there is still radiation and that heat will still be blocked from leaving the house by foil. Unfortunately the majority of heat loss will be from conduction and convection so it will not help much. ,HomeImprovement,darx62m,2,t5_2ql97

9860073,0,t1_dasqgnp,gt the cracking must have happened since it was painted because what insane person other than me would leave cracks on the wall and paintI can assure you the previous tenant is one of those people but there is no paint in the cracks at least not that big one so its unlikely that she painted over the crack. It looks like she painted  years ago based on their tenancy and how gross that room is. gtThe thing that is conserning is the crack across the ceiling and down the wallIm not sure which one youre referring to. None of the cracks continue across the ceiling. There are those really thin ones that go from the wall to the ceiling but whats in the image is about whats visible. gtOne thing you want to do is go into the basement under that window and check the rim joist and wood sill and make sure its not rotting out.. make sure that the joists for the first floor arent damaged or rotting.. you might have to install secondary joists .. sistering them to the old joists to provide more support and the sill might need to be replaced.. kinda a bitch to do but what you do is build a x wall in from the wall of the basement about  feet and then jack up the joists with a long beam running across them .. then sister on new joists.This is what Im hoping it is. The home is certainly old enough for that to be the issue and the walls on the second floor are not showing similar problems nor are the windows or doors which is what Im told is the first place one would expect foundation related plasterdrywall cracks to be found. There is however a balcony with a fire escape on the second floor right above these two rooms and Its possible its not being properly supported I guess so that might be worth looking at. In any case Ive got a contractor coming this week to look into the supporting wood structure in the basement. gtI would bet it is either due to remodeling and thrashing your joists.. or from rot or foundation sinking..The layout is the same upstairs and the bathroom and kitchen have been remodelled but in the same footprint without any pluming being altered. However the previous owner did some remodelling in the unit downstairs and who knows what they did to the floor of the main floor in the process. In the furnace room which is below the problem area they did some fire separation work themselves and there are a few suspicious cuts and the workmanship is poor. Im going to pull some of it down and have a look. gtbut check that block wall in the basement if its cracked badMost of its covered but there is a long section only covered with insulation and plastic sheeting so Im going to take that down and make the the wall is nice and straight with no signs of past repair. I know in the block supporting wall running perpendicular there has been some mortar work at some point but its all nice and straight and the blocks dont look like any are sitting higher than the ones next to them. gtif I was you right now .. spackle those cracks and see if they get worseIs there any downside aside from wasting my time to repairing them correctly?

You can continue to stand by your post but I think if you objectively look at your posts youll see the problem. Here is your first post No offense but if you cant tell thats not a ground wire you should not be messing with electric.That post is not helpful. You dont even recommend a professional you simply tell him that if doesnt know a wire isnt ground he shouldnt mess with his electric. You offer no education no direction no suggestions except that he should abandon his home improvement project. The entire point of this board. I disagreed with your first post in one of my responses down below. But I commended your second post. Lets look at your second postGround wires are almost always either bare copper or green insulated wires. Of course this may not always be the case if a previous homeowner wired something up incorrect and used blackwhite wire as ground for some reason. Any case where there is a nonstandard setup e.g. backfed switch it should be labelled as such with colored tape around the insulation.They would also never be attached to the hot screw of a switch brass color is hot silver is either neutral on an outlet or traveler on a switch. I also advise against using the backstabs on switches because they can come loose over time vs the screwed connections.As others have said you can see the bare wire in the back of the box.This is a great post. You tell him about the wires how to identify them and what to look for in the future. You give him information on other signs like the screws and how the switches should be set up. Its helpful informative and supports him in his project. Thats what IMO this board is about. Any post telling someone to abandon their project is contrary to why were all here. Of course theres lot of middle ground. You could have simply said Thats not a ground. Theres some great books your can pick up to learn the basics of electrical wiring or older posts if you search. I recommend not messing with it until you do.The point is did you offer information andor support the project. In your first post you did neither. Your first post did not contribute to the board.

10491905,0,t3_5q7kgv,Maybe you simply need to tighten the gland nut to compress the stem packing more as shown in this VIDEO  But some faucets dont have a stem seal you can compress or the seal is in such bad shape that tightening doesnt help so you have to replace the seal which you can do without shutting off the water main.  Just close the faucet remove the gland nut at the end remove the handle and take out the seal.  It wouldnt hurt to clean off the mineral deposits from the stem and lubricating the new seal with silicone oil or grease will help it slide easier over the stem.  This video may help.  It also shows how to replace the washer which will require shutting off the main water supply  VIDEO  Im pretty sure you dont need to replace the whole faucet or do any soldering but if you decide to solder beware that the fiberglass insulation will melt from the heat of the torch and the wood holding up the pipes will catch on fire unless you use a heat shield.

Unless you are going to replace the cabinets not just the doors  the actual boxes it is extremely difficult to properly integrate a dishwasher. A single cabinet is much narrower than a dishwasher and a double cabinet is much wider.My house did not come with a dishwasher but one had obviously been there previously. However they took out two bottom cabinets and a doublewide drawer to accommodate it which left a large hole to the side of the dishwasher. I custombuilt a narrow cabinet drawer and matching drawer facing and cabinet door to fill the gap. That is hard to do. It is not something most amateur woodworkers can pull off and it would be very expensive to hire a carpenter.

Instead of telephone lines in the bedrooms request EthernetCAT outlets. .  Smart thermostat. Analyze the location of your water spigots and add more. Sound proof the laundry room. Soundproof every room. Not sure if you have a second floor but insulate the sewage pipe that leads to the basement or upgrade to a cast iron pipe. It helps insulate the noise. It will start to bother you. . Wire for exterior motion sensing lights sides of house and basement door.This one is costly spray foam. If you cant afford it do an energy efficiency test and ask the builder to cover the spots with the spray foam cans. . Ask for the HVAC filters to be easily accessible. I have to take a door off blah blah. Im seen some on Pinterest that you open the hatch and swap out the filters and done. . If your plan allows nd floor laundry room. Ensure there is a drain and I recommend you put tilesbaseboard too in that room. . Island  in the kitchen with power outlets. Cant have enough outlets.. The garage door if its not wifi enabled the upgrade is about  more.  If the garage is underneath a room soundproof it. When its ready to be mounted I would get rubber pads to minimize the vibrationssame for VAC unit in attack . Take pictures before insulation and Sheetrock is installed. Its a good reference for future projects. . Basement plumbing for future bathroom or kitchen. Utility meters and the HvAC see if you can Have it all on same side of the house  towards the back of the house.  . Attic once insulation is place ask to lay down plywood. Eventually you will need it for storage. That means the air duct need to be channeled . Fans in all the bedrooms and living room. Im not a handy guy. Im the kind that has a guy for that. If youre in the same boat.  Discuss your limitations with significant other and pay a little extra now. If you have a problem and its not an emergency research in YouTube.

The ones with mold are probably still structurally sound hence not replaced.First where is the moisture coming from? Is it just condensation? or is it also from leaks due to things like ice dam since you mentioned lack of insulation ice dam is a possibility.If it is just condensation then you will need to air seal your attic first properly vent the attic and then add insulation.

You must cure the drainage issue first.Spray foam is a bad idea under the house unless you are in a really dry area...even then I wouldnt.  It is a great insulating product.  But its also great at holding moisture in.  So if it ever gets wet in your crawlspace it will be like having sponges glued to your wood framing.  It will greatly increase your chance of serious wood rot and mold setting in.  Look up people who have been through it.  Google spray foam crawlspace wood rotAlso it makes it very hard to inspect for insect damage and some like to nest in it.I would use foam board in between the joists or the foundation walls....after you solve the water issue.  If that gets wet its easy to remove and replace.  Use XPS not Polyiso.  XPS doesnt absorb water.Your first option absolutely should be to fix the drainage around your house.  Vented crawlspaces work great in the Southwest and North.

Yes Ikea uses particle board and mdf for the boxes but so do lots of millwork shops that are custom building cabinets to be used in a commercialinstitutional environments.They hold up fine. If you have a big leak under your sink and dont clean it up right away  itll swell up  but plywood is gonna swell up too in that situation. Plus Particle board is more dimensional stable than plywood and less susceptible to warping. Ikea kitchens use high end Blum hardware. This is pretty much the best hardware you can buy and IKEA sells it for cheaper than anyware else. Many of the RTA places that have popped up online and in brick and mortar showrooms can look appealing because they have plywood boxes and fancy hardware for the same price or even cheaper than Ikea but they use terrible quality Chinese plywood that is filled with formaldehyde and it delaminates and warps like crazy. Their hardware is also crappy Chinese knockoffs of high end like Blum hinges and drawer slides.

11108991,0,t3_5ymiwa,Its not uncommon to replace an insulated glass unit in a window like that. Over time seals can fail and you end up with condensation between the panes. So most people will replace the double pane glass unit rather than tearing out the frames and everything. It sounds to me like when they replaced those insulated units they didnt seal them properly. I would start with running a bead of  clear silicone around the edge of where the glass meets the window frame to see if that reduces the drafts. You could also check outside and see if there are gaps between the frame and the siding.Anderson doesnt want to come out and work on them  they just want to sell you new windows. If youre calling a replacement window company they will tell you the same thing for the same reason. If it were me and I didnt want to mess with caulking etc I would call a local glass shop and ask them what they would charge to reseal the insulated glass units. Youre probably looking at a minimum trip charge to do that. You could also have them check the weatherstripping if its a casement window. Might not be getting a good sealWorked for a glass shop for like  years  we did that kind of stuff all the time. ,HomeImprovement,der70ex,5,t5_2ql97
11111359,0,t1_derg9ho,Ok so Im assuming youve got one hot wire coming in. Not a  certainty but more than likely theres only a single hot in a switch box once you remove the switches. An option to tell which wire connects to what in the box would be to. Disconnect everything. All wire nuts and wires joined together.. Figure out which wire is hot. Use your non contact voltage meter for that. Again more than likely it will be a black wire thats grouped with a white and ground. . At this point you could make the other wires hot one at a time to determine how its wired. If I were to bet this is the way they are wired in my house and others Ive seen Youve got a hot coming in along with neutral and ground from the circuit. Then the red wire is supposed to be hot for the fan portion of the ceiling fan black is hot for the light portion and white is neutral. Im not sure what kind of cluster the PO wired up but thats normal in my neck of the world.

11242590,0,t1_df6ahkj,Going to be a little messy. First decide on the finish height youd like. You will be gaining the height by replacing the kick which is the base the cabinet is sitting upon. Youll make it as much taller as you want the cabinet to be.The mirror comes down the plumbing detached. The splash is likely glued on and will need to be carefully pried off. With the drawers removed you should be able to access all the screws that hold the counter. You will probably need to remove the counter to lift and move the cabinet but you can unfasten the cabinet from the wall and see if you can move it as is. Be aware of the plumbing. That will leave the the kick. Its usually just some ripped down plywood and should be easy to replace with your taller version. Now you can replace everything at the new height. Use shims to level the cabinet. If the cabinet has a backing youll need to reconfigure it for the plumbing. Thats the rough version with limited info. ,HomeImprovement,df6bxe0,2,t5_2ql97

Id try to do it so you can thread the new one in for easier replacement in the future. Just cut the pipe back some and sweat or if you have to use a sharkbite but sweating is not hard in a female adapter. If your current valve is not the longest size you can just cut it back sweat your adapter where you cut and use the next size up valve. Otherwise youll need a union to get your pipe back to the original length. In either case youll need to wrap the male threads with Teflon tape in the direction of the threads. I generally like to make the threaded connection first then sweat the whole assembly in. Watch a couple YouTube videos for sweating its not difficult to do.,HomeImprovement,dfeyyqu,1,t5_2ql97

11381278,0,t3_62d9xk,I once made one out of a few pieces of half inch PVC into which I drilled a series of small holes. I plumbed it up above my head and hung it from the ceiling with a series of drywall anchors pipe clamps and some string where I wanted it to hang down.I hated it. It was much harder to lift my arm and rinse my underarms. Also it made me realize how much I love standing in a neutral position having warm water blast me in the face. With the water coming from straight up it was instead the top of my head getting blasted while water would run down my face in little streams which was absolutely terrible in comparison. It tickled my face. I had to crank my head back to get the satisfying face blast which made my neck sore real quick.Also if its designed to rain down water instead of a higher pressure blast like a normal shower you might find it more difficult to rinse off. Ive since rebuilt it into a series of vertical pipes mounted between a little higher than the mixing valve and going up above my head. It blasts my whole torso from the side and it is amazing.    ,HomeImprovement,dfm1riw,1,t5_2ql97

Gas cooking surpasses that of electric and it will be an upgrade that adds value to your home. If youre a cook have gas plumbed to the house already itll cost a few hundred to run a gas line.  If you dont want to do that I would honestly avoid a glass cooktop.  Theyre a PITA to keep clean and to clean.  One would think its easier but it isnt.

11460156,0,t1_dfuxikc,I actually went to Lowes last night and picked up two xs that Im going to rip into several pieces from  at the corner to probably  or  near the seam depending on how clean the cuts are from my table saw. Ill run each piece floor to ceiling mainly to minimize the mud I need to use.But I also grabbed a vinyl square corner since Id been using the vinyl bullnose corners around my windows got new windows that were deeper than the old ones so I had to redo all the sheetrock on the sides and am replacing the square corners with bullnose. Is there a big difference between vinyl and metal? Would a metal corner be much better than the vinyl? I searched online and reviews were pretty divided. It seems like the people who preferred the metal stated it held up better and was stronger than the vinyl but the people who preferred vinyl said that vinyl resists impacts better and is superior than metal. They also stated the people who preferred metal were stuck in their ways even when a better product is around. I already have the vinyl corner so do you think its returning it and getting a metal one? For what its worth I dont use the glue which seemed to be the basis of several complaints. I put mud behind it and then screw it down being careful to not go too far and create the bubbles from warping the vinyl.And I also have a bucket of premixed mud that Ive been using for other projects but Im assuming the powder stuff is better enough that I should probably go get that? If so Ive only ever used premixed so do you have any pointers on the best way to mix the powder mud and what consistency I should look for? Im not too worried about it but sometimes those pointers can save some frustrations. And Ive gotten pretty decent with my taping knife over the years but I have a concrete trowel too so I might give that a try.gtAnd next time youll check your studs with the level before you put your sheetrock on!Haha yup.

11644624,0,t1_dgfvpsx,The suggestion completely removes the need for attic venting.  Thats the point of insulation above deck.  Attic vents are not designed to remove heat from the attic theyre to keep the roof deck cold in winter to avoid condensation risk from water vapor contacting cold sheathing.  Insulating above the deck keeps it in the conditioned space which eliminates the condensation risk entirely.  Then with a properly insulated roof envelope the cooling system can work effectively at removing waste heat from the home.  There is no good way to properly insulate the upper floor of a bungalow therefore retrofitting at the roof deck is the textbook way to fix their insulation problems.

See if you can add a weather gasket around the hatch.Most of what is warming the second floor of your house in summer is internally driven gains.  The biggest gains are typically people cooking refrigerators and lighting.  Id start by converting all lighting to LED if it isnt already.  Then grill more outside in summer to keep cooking loads low.  Also make sure your freezer is full to reduce the compressor cycling.  If its not full add ziploc bags full of water for extra thermal mass.In zone  its probably rarely hot outside so leaving the upper half of upstairs windows about  open and bottom half of downstairs windows will help create a stack effect to vent hot air from the house.,HomeImprovement,dggqf3e,1,t5_2ql97
