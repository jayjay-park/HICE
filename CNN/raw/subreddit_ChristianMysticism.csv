11425533,0,t3_631b7f,If you think this doesnt have to do with mysticism youre wrong. There are true and false paths to the spirit the mystic must know all that is right and wrong. Tila and others have given themselves up to other methods than proper meditation and ethical individualism. Secret rule when learning spiritual world from where we came where our home is.For every one step of spiritual knowledge one learns. One must take  steps towards moral development. True moral development has no outside influence including scriptures. Otherwise one will be taking a detour.,ChristianMysticism,dfr2mia,1,t5_2wobz
11706195,0,t1_dgmwaan,Christian mysticism. Meditation. Unity with God. The usual. Seriously though its like  pages long and theres even a tldr read version of just the spiritual practices at the end. Worth a read.Its just a super obscure text that does not appear to exist online or anywhere. Since my local library had a copy that was about to fall apart I figured I would put it out there.,ChristianMysticism,dgmx8uf,2,t5_2wobz
