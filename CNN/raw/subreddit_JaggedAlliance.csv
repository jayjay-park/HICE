2851539,0,t3_2sr2o6,If the game crashes on startup it might have to do with the intro. A popular and simple fix for this problem is to simply rename  Intro.slf to Intro.slf.bak the file can be found in SteamsteamappscommonJagged Alliance  GoldData. If that doesnt help it also depends on your OS try searching in the JA Steam community forumsTo boost your confidence a bit The game does run on modern hardware. I still play it on a regular basis both vanilla and ..,JaggedAlliance,cns7xiw,2,t5_2tdmr

Same for JA with v.. Theres LOTS of mods for JA adding LOTS of different things theres probably a dozen or more new storylines or total reskins and v. adds lots of items keyboard shortcuts and so on to the core game without changing it. Id suggest upgrading to . it adds shiftR to reload all your mercs guns at once a new inventory system a massive number of new items...the benefits are many. It drastically cuts down on the micromanaging of inventory space and ammo. Right click on a gun or item to open a description. The damage is in health points so  damage   health points gone off the enemy assuming they have no armor. Also IIRC armor is applied to all damage not by location. So a bare head and treated spectra vest with ceramic plates and treated spectra pants will give protection to the head.Training is mostly useless but it is useful for hiring the cheaper guys from MERC like Haywire and Razor. Once they got up to  Marksmanship I put Haywire and Razor with my main squad and started them gaining experience through action.Cover is life. You NEED to be under cover during your turn. ,JaggedAlliance,cps2our,2,t5_2tdmr
