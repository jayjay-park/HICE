11178477,0,t1_dez0vvn,Well postleft anarchism as an actual tendency didnt become a thing until probably the late s and has really been developed over the past  years. PLA is definitely influenced by Stirner but it is also influenced by individualist anarchism consequently influenced by Stirner insurrectionary anarchism green anarchism nihilism and I would say even the illegalists.Also maybe important to note that Stirner wasnt an anarchist at least so much as he didnt call himself one and was not as far as we know considered one during his time. Not because he didnt fit the description but because he was something more. And also of course because he would not resign himself to an identity or ideology. I dont even think that the early individualists who were  directly influenced by him called him one. ,TheUnique,dez2gcs,3,t5_3fiqo
