758140,0,t1_cgoifjv,I guess it is strange to ask that of me. I really wasnt sure if it has happened before. But again Im okay with it. Giving them my first child was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in my life. But she is the happiest healthiest baby ever and shell have an upbringing that Id never be able to afford even if I got the best job that I am qualified for. This time around I feel like more of a surrogate than someone who has no choice but to place their child up for adoption like the first time. I am not prepared for this baby terminating the pregnancy is not an option for me so the next best choice for me is to suck it up and give my already beautiful baby a sibling. A biological sibling whom she can grow up with. This way I am the only adoptive parent that they will be dealing with and I can see my kids grow up together.  Call me coldhearted but while I am hurting a bit inside at the prospect of going through another adoption Im happy to do this for two people I actually care about more than my biological family. I hope this makes some kind of sense and Im not coming off as an uncaring jerk. ,birthparents,cgqggzm,2,t5_2v0q4

1388772,0,t1_ciqcpbt,I think it has potential to be good. Think about Teen mom particularly... Caitlyn and Tyler.. . The one who chose adoption... They depicted that story of adoption so nicely. This has potential to be great and potential to be terrible. ,birthparents,ciqd4n1,5,t5_2v0q4
1918298,0,t1_ckjaieu,I know there is truth to those stories and experiences I was just stating to beware on reading those after placing. Some birthmothers dont know how they feel so if all the read are negative stories that is how they will feel.Some adoption agency are terrible. They are out to take the money and take the baby. Some arent some are kind loving caring and helpful. Yes in certain states mothers have time to change her mind sometimes they dont. Some agencies allow that money that would be owed are medical bills or any other help the birth mother got during the pregnancy but it is heard of. The parents dont have to terminate the rights as soon as  they leave the hospital. There is cradle care where loving people take the newborn while the mother decides. Adoption agencies arent all the bad. There are ways to protect the mother just have to be informed.Adoptions that are forces are terrible and it should happen that being said the ONLY person to make the decision should be the mom not the family members. Do the family members have full responsibilty no they dont so they shouldnt get a say.  The babys siblings and grandparents aunts uncles and cousin shouldnt get a say because in the end the mother is full responsibility. Yes my parents would have loved for me to keep my baby because its their grandchild but they dont have rights or custody they dont make decisions about the baby or help pay for college. its is only the mothers decision and no one elses!Adoption has changed greatly within the last decade and open adoptions have been very popular and the studies are great. My son will never have false information he will know who is parents are why we placed him that we love and care for him. He will know me. He will know all the medical family history. If he gets sick and needs my bone marrow? I am only a phone call and flight away. He can make all the right medical decisions since he will have all the information he will know. Not only does my son have two parents that love him he has two extra parents to love him. And yes adoption sometimes guarantee a better life. My son is living a much better life than I could have ever gave him. I still love him and I still am in his life. But he has parents who have his full attention parents who arent struggling with money who have gone to school parents who stay home with them. He has parents who are mature enough to make responsible decisions. In my book that is a better life. I am sorry about you adoption but todays adoptions have changed a lot. I am sorry you have permanent family separation but now its not always the case with open adoptions being a choice. And dont you ever assume that a birthparent decide to just go and get pregnant and place a baby. Dont even began to assume why they are having a child they have to place. Do not ever tell a birthmother to get adequate birth control.Secondly who is to say that the only family is blood. It is not the majority of people whom i consider family arent blood and werent brought up in the same roots  There is nothing wrong with being raised by different roots. As far as I am concerned my child is being raise in his own roots. They might not be biologically but they are still his. Most and most importantly this is about support. ,birthparents,ckkcbab,2,t5_2v0q4

5471031,0,t3_3napia,Hi! Do you have any identifying information at all? All I had was a name and I was able to find my halfsister on Spokeo which led me to her facebook. Then I was able to get in touch with her. That is also how I found my birth father and his family. I ended up finding his mother and after talking to her she put me in touch with him.My mother has a pretty big internet trail so I was able to find her on Facebook. I typed in her first and last name followed by the state I thought she lived in and found her right away. ,birthparents,cwaz4tm,2,t5_2v0q4
8205379,0,t1_d534c2q,Hes about  months old now. Ive spoken to a lawyer and they all wont take my case because I have no rights as an unmarried father.,birthparents,d5386k5,1,t5_2v0q4
8439811,0,t1_d5wayw0,So I had a closed adoption. Zero contact with the bio family. For me this created feelings of abandonment and became a perceived source of anxiety. I say perceived because it either did the same thing to my bio dad damn that man is an anxious person who has fears of getting to know me in case I reject him or its just DNA Im battling. I didnt have the opportunity to ask my bio dad about the adoption until I found him last year. I know now that he had no say in it. His mother pushed for adoption and so did my birth mother as she felt my maternal family was unsafe. I think it was mental health issues in the family but nobody will confirm.  I have yet to get anyone drunk enough to answer honestly and at length. PMy adoptive family is a bit unique. My dad was adopted closed from a different family his next brother came biologically and the third also adopted from a different family still. My sister was adopted from another family than i. Many of my cousins have chosen to adopt. We have some vocal pills but really what family doesnt?My adoptive family on both sides takesthe more the merrier to heart. The majority dont care how you became family. You just are. When I said I met my bio dad my  year old Grandma said When is he coming over? His food is getting cold. I need to meet the family I never knew.  My dads side asked Does he like shellfish or is he a pansy like you? I need to know if hell eat too much crab As for given up I didnt see it that way mentally but emotionally sometimes. I have a flare  the dramatic side. When I turned  I recognized how scary having a kid at that age would be. I became grateful for my adoption at  I had no money I was about partying not responsible and had more school to do and if I became pregnant I didnt know if I would abort place for adoption or keep and provide less than i felt a child deserved.  At  Im considering having kids andbab now grateful to my adoptive parents for recognizing they were ready to parent and they didnt care how they got their babies. I grew up with the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb and I believe it. I choose people who choose me. My bio dad chose to know me and he fulfills the role in my family we didnt know we needed.  No secret handshake necessary just a solid I want you in my life.When I met my bio dad and his family his mother asked for forgiveness. She didnt need to I felt no animosity but it was a sweet gesture. It was weird looking at people who look like me. I knew he couldnt replace my dad nor did I want him too mentally but meeting him made me thankful I was adopted so I could know my parents and him. Eitheror is not my style. Im a bothand kind of lady.My sister placed a baby for a semiopen adoption. He was able to contact her with questions but not meet her in person until he was . It was her decision to give him to two doting parents who could afford the best for him. We would have helped her raise him but we were impressed with her selfless decision too. We just met him again and he is perfect. We adore him.,birthparents,d5wik5f,2,t5_2v0q4
10608797,0,t1_dda6x1s,Thank you for your advice. Advocating is something we definitely have experience with. My son was recently diagnosed with high functioning Autism so mama bear has had many battles and there are many more to come I am sure. Financial benefits are great but emotionalpsychological benefits are far more important. The fact that people use a birth families immaturity or lack of education i mean young teens still in school here as an advantage to essentially screw them over and wind up screwing up things for the child angers me. ,birthparents,dda7sf6,1,t5_2v0q4
