5328102,0,t1_cvsoeux,gtThe Red Bulls main rival is D.C. United against whom they compete for the Atlantic Cup. The New England Revolution and the Philadelphia Union are also rivals of the Red Bulls. The Red Bulls had not defeated the Revolution at the latters home venue Gillette Stadium for  years until a  win on June   intensifying the rivalry. These rivalries arise out of geographic proximity and as a reflection of longstanding rivalries between New Yorkarea teams and other teams in Washington D.C. Boston and Philadelphia.gtIn  the Red Bulls faced off against another team from the New York metropolitan area in MLS league play for the first time when New York City FC entered MLS. Although initially regarded as a manufactured rivalry with little of the traditional banter apparent between longtime local rivals the first meetings between the teams dislayed an increasing level of animosity between the two sides. The Red Bulls won the first ever encounter between the two a league game on May   at Red Bull Arena. A series of brawls between supporters of the two teams occurred before and after matches between the two teams.gtAlthough the rivalry with NYCFC was built to be the major one for the Red Bulls this was not the first time that they played against a team from the local area as in both  against F.C. New York who have since folded and  against the New York Cosmos they had matches against lowerlevel league opponents from the New York area in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. The Red Bulls also played against the Cosmos in the  U.S. Open Cup to a  victory.,DCUnited,cvsq603,-1,t5_2rbli

6835424,0,t3_49duw4,Ktown was my old home town team. As much as I hate to say it he is probably better off at Hearts. Kaiserslautern used to be one of the greats of the Bundesliga but that was before they went through a bankruptcy and relegation. They havent been the same since. Even when they finally managed to pull themselves out of their rut they were pulled apart by the bigger fish and relegated again within two years.,DCUnited,d0r3i5o,1,t5_2rbli
6836634,0,t1_d0qjuv7,I thought watching on TV that Acosta looked good on the ball but mostly bad overall.  He didnt have the dangerous edge he displayed in previous games.  I did like him making Cole look silly though which might have been a foul. It was a good sub in my view it is just that the subs that came on didnt show much of anything.  ,DCUnited,d0r8goa,1,t5_2rbli
