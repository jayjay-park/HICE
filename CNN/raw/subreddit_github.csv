385929,0,t3_1yi09a,The easiest way to find popular open source projects on GitHub is through the discover link at the top of the main GitHub page. The projects listed on that page however may be fairly complex. The discover link is best suited to users who are following other GitHub users with a similar skill level as GitHub displays repositories that have been starred by users that the GitHub user is following on the discover page.Other easy ways to find cool open source projects on GitHub include searching for a few code related terms you are interested in for example linux or network protocol and browsing the search results using the language tabs on the left hand side of the site.You could also take a look at a few programs or applications that you use and see if they have a GitHub page or opensource repository available on GitHub.,github,cfkrmpp,1,t5_2s5m1

1318605,0,t1_cihxle6,You dont need to use the Add process. Its there for the sake of convenience. That library is for manipulating lists. You only need to use a small part of its functionality. The add function is for someone who might need to dynamically add entries to a table.All you need to worry about are the sort and search functions. Your information will be laid out like the Existing List example. You never add or remove anything.gtAnd in my theoretical project I would want to update the Jekyll files that originated the html in the first place? not the html that github throws up out the Jekyll files?You have to throw up the HTML files that jekyll generates.Get Started With GitHub Pages Plus Bonus JekyllYou may also want to try DataTables instead of List.js. It all depends on your needs.,github,cihykkh,1,t5_2s5m1

3746705,0,t3_33b9sr,If you clone the repo it is easier to update it.  Just run git pull from the projects directory.  To know when there is an update you can watch the repo if its on github.  Then pay attention to your github stream.   If I might want to make a pull request or just want more control of pushing I will fork the repo and clone that.  To keep that up to date I will set up an upstream branch linking it to the original.,github,cqjclnk,2,t5_2s5m1
4149593,0,t1_crn8p5d,Thanks for the help but I ended up having to do it through the Git Shell. I meant I wanted to delete a whole directory in one of my repositories. The garbage can was only showing up for the individual files in the directory I want deleted. Too bad there isnt a way to delete the directory on the website,github,crt9ntw,1,t5_2s5m1
5266396,0,t3_3n3bcb,I dont think you can do that with gists. You could always as the information as a comment at the top of the code or make a normal repo for it.,github,cvku9zs,1,t5_2s5m1

11428575,0,t3_633v2l,I think you can upload binaries to releases but I dont remember if they killed that feature completely or not. GitHub isnt really a good solution for that though you want bintray or s or even SourceForge.gt Second question if I do a check in to my local repo and do a Sync in Visual Studio to publish to the server as a check in does that automatically publish to the open source project?If it is publishing to the server then yes that sounds like a push. But youd need to look at the documentation for that plugin to be sure.gt I might not be ready to publish something to the open source project but I want to do a check in sometimes just to have the code updated. Is that possible?It is definitely possible with git I dont know if its possible with your plugin. You just want to make commits they dont appear on GitHub until you push them there.,github,dfrf0qt,1,t5_2s5m1
