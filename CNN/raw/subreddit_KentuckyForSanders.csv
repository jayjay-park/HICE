7065572,0,t1_d1h7iln,Well heres a quick video on his views on the displacement of coal workers.Hes saying that we cant keep investing in coal because as an industry it is drying up more people are losing jobs. Republicans keep telling people coal is still here when it isnt.Basically he wants to put in place New Deal style programs to build up infrastructure. Essentially the TVA but for Eastern Kentuckians. Admittedly he doesnt have any specific plan or policy decisions as far as Im aware but he does seem to believe that this is an issue and he does have a focus on Appalachia.,KentuckyForSanders,d1h8tl3,6,t5_3811v
