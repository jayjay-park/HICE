If you talk to your doctor about the cost of your med Im sure heshe will know how to write the prescriptions to help you pay less. The doctor may write it for mg so you can get  months worth out of  pills. Also make sure its a med that can be broken some are dangerous if crushed or broken. If you have prescription drug insurance it will be covered. If your not sure call your insurance company.,darkstore,d6ecp50,1,t5_3fq6i
