639561,0,t1_cgcxz8d,Indeed  the canonical case where you must include all of the frequencies is when the time series is complex and the frequency components arent repeated. Otherwise the knowledge that it has been repeated together with the subset of the data is sufficient to reconstruct the full set of componentsEDIT But in particular I wasnt referring to being able to discard half of the components. Rather for the example above the frequency components calculated over the range  to w would mean that you say the frequency components are at  Hz and  Hz. Whereas interpreting the range as w to w that is the second half of the FFT as being frequencies w  would mean you say the frequency components are at  Hz and  Hz. I would have said that the latter case allows for a more useful interpretation of the resulting frequencies at least in this case,matlab,cgcyvwr,2,t5_2r4xn

This is especially true when the command is sent to multiple workers simultaneously such as inside a parfor spmd or a communicating job.

2884736,0,t3_2t5v6x,The right answer is to benchmark it and see. However my instinct is that you should run  threads.The reason is that hyperthreading works by interleaving instructions from different threads that are parts of different functional units of the CPU and using register renaming to do that.   For example if you have two threads one of which has an instruction pointer point to a floatingpoint add and the other has an instruction pointer pointing to a memory operation then it really CAN do BOTH in parallel which is good for performance.When this would be bad for performance is when both instruction pointers consistently do the same type of instruction like they are all FPU ops or the instruction pointers are exactly synchronized.  In this case the contention of the attempt and then failure to hyperthread WOULD cause degraded performance.The right thing to do is benchmark both ways and see which way is better for your application.  However because  even the densest of numerical codes is usually less than  FPU ops and has lots of integer and controlflow and memory ops too and  For parallel matlab unless its running CPUcontrolled OpenCL code on the backend its likely that each thread has a different instruction pointer location so they are likely to be out of sync so hyperthreading is likely to work.,matlab,cnvzw7d,9,t5_2r4xn

6286356,0,t3_41p0us,I am not sure whether to call this a tip or a hack but...As you know global variables are dangerous because they arent cleared when your function ends.  However if you want to pass large matrices between functions and modify them it can be very slow because MATLAB makes a copy of the entire matrix if you change even a single element.A workaround one of my teachers taught us is to abuse the handle graphics system.  You create a figure keeping its handle in a variable then immediately hide it.  You can attach the matrices you want to the figure using its attributes and pass the figure handle to additional functions.  You can then access the matrices in these other functions without making a copy by accessing these attributes.  When the outer function ends close the figure using the handle and the matrices are also cleared from memory.,matlab,cz46rth,6,t5_2r4xn

Also the line inside the for loop should probably be something like this    for i  lengthx        yi  equationxi  do whatever calculation you want but assign the result to yi    endNote the xi insteadthis uses ith value x in the equation and assigns the result to the ith value of y.,matlab,cz59pzs,2,t5_2r4xn

6500088,0,t1_czrdvvw,Close but you cant pass the function like thatyou need to use matrixinput not matrixinput this is called a function handle essentially its a variable reference to the function in the workspace from which the function handle was created allowing you to pass the reference between various scopes. Alternatively you could pass the function name as a string and use either feval or strfunc to evaluate the function or create a reference respectively there are some advantages and disadvantages to each method but either would work for your case. When you use a function name not quoted and not preceded by an  symbol Matlab calls the function immediatelywith any implicit or explicit arguments. Im not sure what you mean by jump between functionssimply typing the function name with any required parameters exactly as you would for a function native to Matlab such as uicontrol figure or uitable causes execution to jump to that function where Matlab executes its instructions and return execution to the calling function or base workspace in programming terms it adds the function to the execution stack. You might be having trouble if youre working in multiple files and name your main functions something that doesnt match the filenamethat is only the first function in a file can generally be called by function external to that file and the function is known to matlab as the filename without the extension regardless of the functions name within the file. If all of your functions are in a single file though or if you use one function per file and keep the filename and function name the same that shouldnt be an issue. If you can describe the problem youre having in more detail including the error text if any or the behavior you expected vs the behavior you got that would help narrow this down. ,matlab,czrnpa8,1,t5_2r4xn

Check out the highlight videos from the last  releases to just get an idea of the scope.babDont forget to thumb through the release notes for every toolbox.And be sure to check out a when it releases in a few weeks.gt For users who didnt code the initial software this can be a show stopper hence why we stay with certain versions for a few years.Youre missing the larger picture here. Sometimes there are changes made to code and that sometimes breaks your code. Thats not just to stab you in the back  Its to improve the software. In addition MATLAB plays nice by only having a huge release every  months. Compared to some python packages which will stop being developed at the drop of a hat or change dramatically monthtomonth MATLAB does a pretty good job of keeping things stable and consistent where they can. ,matlab,dbjkha7,2,t5_2r4xn

10805677,0,t3_5ujkmr,youre really close! in order to get the indexing right in this case you need to use brackets    MaGyou also need to be careful with using more than two colons in a range statement. Im not sure what will happen if anything if you use more than two,matlab,dduj2o8,2,t5_2r4xn

10878061,0,t1_de1zh8x,That sounds trickier and could possibly depend on on how the angular velocities were measured not totally sure.Ideally you could integrate each velocity to get the corresponding angle but there very well could be a noncommutativity that ruins that.,matlab,de1ztiy,2,t5_2r4xn
10915894,0,t1_de5pnbg,Alright so I need to plot a phase plane of a pendulum energy equation but I need to plot dthetadt agains theta. Where theta is the angle of the pendulum. ,matlab,de5wb97,1,t5_2r4xn

11363870,0,t3_622z8v,The basics of Matlab are quick to learn especially if youve programmed before.  There are numerous short tutorials available online and theres a freeware clone of Matlab called Octave thats a good way to get your feet wet with the language.  There are tons of code examples widespread on the net.  Id recommend learning some basics on how to read in an Excel spreadsheet often used by biologists and then navigating the rows and columns after youve read them in perhaps doing some basic plotting.Heres the intro from Mathworks for those new to the language,matlab,dfk2n26,1,t5_2r4xn
11570556,0,t1_dg7imgi,okay cellfun is basically a loop and in this case it calls your gravitationalPull function with one row from your matrix a time. You put this line and also take its output argument in whatever script or function you want to gtpass a vector through this function element by element ,matlab,dg7j106,1,t5_2r4xn
