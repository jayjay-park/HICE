Im pretty sure the translators would still remain active in the community and might be able to give you more of a proper response. I do remember them saying why it wouldnt happenwasnt likely to happen but I cant remember if it was in the Kickstarter or early in the G community. If you ask you could probably get a faster response than going digging I guess? D If you dont have a G account and dont want one ever just give me a ping and Ill post this thread to the community for you. iirc Andy K has a Reddit account and could answer you here.If I were to hazard a guess part of the reason is that they already have so many addons to TBZ and Ryuutama on the fire and are looking forward to their next project Shinobigami. But Im not sure that was the original reason they mentioned. ,TenraBanshoZero,ctbxjx7,2,t5_2xi1z

I commonly ran it while teaching it and depending on the pacing one story might actually take  sessions depending on session length etc. What we were trying to make more clear is that its meant to tell one story starttofinish in about  hours assuming player group where everyone is familiar with the rules and its not as much meant for the longrunning weekly home games like the classic DampD sessions that happen weekly for a year or more which I love and have done for the last twenty years but this isnt meant for that. Note that if you want to learn the core of the game Go to the rule book and read the orso manga rules comics. That alone seriously teaches you about  of what you need to play. The random playerGM advice section also clarifies a lot about how TBZ can differ from other RPGs.,TenraBanshoZero,ctcy0v5,2,t5_2xi1z
