668510,0,t3_21sr5y,I recommend Invision community Suite.  The permission system is fairly granular and they have their own chat solution.  You can easily limit access to registered members only which would also keep google and and other indexing bots out.  Its not free but its the best solution out there.  It costs about  up front and then  or so a year to keep an active license after that.   Message me privately if youd be interested in tossing a few bucks my way to help out.  Ive been using Invision products for about  years now.,union,cgg9btv,1,t5_2qolh
10988886,0,t3_5wuuh4,gtI have gotten a raise back pay and they laid out a raise schedule that does equate to more money than the union was getting me.Youre right to not trust. Theyre using your pay as a carrot to dangle in front of the remaining members of the bargaining unit to convince them that things are better without representation and organization. Once the unions gone theyll move toward treating employees as disposable.Its never just about pay. Union representation is about the bargaining unit having your back when the boss gets shitty. Its about not getting fired over petty shit. Its about making sure that safety rules are adhered to  for you and for the guests. Its about not fearing retaliation if you have to go above the boss head. And so much more.Dont get seduced by the paycheck or other perks. That which they give they can also take away get it in writing in the form of a contract and youre in a much better position.,union,dedk073,7,t5_2qolh
