This is what caused a tradition of vaqueros migrant workers. Laws dont mean justice laws mean power and defending those who oppose the powerless have never looked good in the annuls of history. Not a good look bro have more empathy and knowledge of WHY things are the way they are. Whataboutism and ruleoflaw will get you no where but under a boot one day.,startrekgifs,dd8r6dm,11,t5_2u6ut

11636009,0,t1_dgex3l1,No not at all. What we can blame is the federal government mandating that student loans have protection from bankruptcy. A prospective student shouldnt be the only one shouldering  of the burden of risk. If student loans didnt have bankruptcy protection banks would have to make better decisions about investing their money in students that might not be able to pay and anticipated major upon graduation would probably be a factor in their decision. This in turn would drive students towards obtaining degrees in higher demand.As it is were often asking  year olds to take on thousands of dollars in debt before theyve been trained to make good decisions about their lives. When they graduate theyre stuck with a piece of paper that doesnt do them much good and often upwards of k in debt because they made stupid decisions while they werent yet not stupid enough to make them. Thats the racket. We need to force the better decision and we can accomplish that through opening up access to bankruptcy for new student loans.,startrekgifs,dgeydcs,11,t5_2u6ut
11636289,0,t1_dgeydcs,Yeah obviously in an ideal world banks would be able to accurately predict who will successfully be able to repay their student loans and give people perfectlysized loans for their particular situations. Student loans are protected from bankruptcy because banks cannot accurately predict who will be successful nor even what people will end up studying for millions of students every year. So they give people carte blanche to take whatever loans they think they need. The alternative is a massive reduction in choice.,startrekgifs,dgezihe,1,t5_2u6ut

11639762,0,t1_dgfbwd6,Nice at my first two labs my direct shift managers both quit and I requested being the replacement at each.I ended up just absorbing duties and not pay raises.. Oh well X has been here  years if anything he should be the manager!  X worked there in his position until the day the doors shut not long after I quit. Y is obviously your manager shes in charge and has been here  years so what if I cant actually call her your manager because she only has a GED?Y cant get a job anywhere related because she frequently goes on powertrips and had been harassing people she didnt like until they quit. It was a high turnover kinda place so she really did good in ruining her career by pissing off people for that long consistently!Im at a dream lab now dont worry!   ,startrekgifs,dgfdpdr,1,t5_2u6ut
11641312,0,t1_dgfdm7n,There are reports published by the department of labor statistics every year which aggregates data from every industry on salaries market and job market. They determine these statistics based on data collected by programmers and interpreted by economists. Ideally this would be the metric by which degree quotas are established. For the general population college is education for a career and on an ethical basis only the elite who can actually afford degrees that are economically irrelevant should get them. It is unethical to educate a student in gender studies for k under the guise that the degree will land them a job that will pay their loan off. Education for the education is for the elite. For the rest of us education is for our careers.Since you want to take it literally that programmers and engineers are the only things I think are valuable in the economy and not just two of the many extremely lucrative careers right now Ill go ahead and humor you. If everyone was programmers and engineers I think we would have a golden age of innovation in which automation precision and performance would boom in such a way that would sling shot our society into Star trek levels of utopian comfort. Arts would decline but lets face it generally most art has gone from the eisle to the monitor and rock is slowly dying. But then again there is a need for each type of degree in industry as there is money in every sector it just so happens that more liberal arts degrees are awarded than science degrees and thats a problem as our economy currently is heavily based on integrating technology for increased performance.,startrekgifs,dgfk198,1,t5_2u6ut
11643491,0,t1_dgew9mf,A degree should be an indicator of your ability to learn and what knowledge youve gained. Not an indicator of your ability to spend money you may or may not have yet so that you have a chance to learn. If college was free not everyone would go and not everyone would pass. So a degree would still mean something and people who are smart and hardworking enough to get one but dont have the economic capability to do so without indebting themselves for decades would have the option to try.,startrekgifs,dgfsxj1,1,t5_2u6ut
