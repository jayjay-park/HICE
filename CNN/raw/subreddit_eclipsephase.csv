63013,0,t3_1usos7,I have not played eclipse phase so I will comment from an outside perspective.Theoretically the swarm of nanobots should be able to be any size.  Practically however it is an entirely separate issue.Lets say a swarm wants to disassemble a spaceship.  How many robots does it need to do that?  Well the spaceship is  million cubic inches so if each nanobot can dissolve one cubic inch per second it takes  million to dissolve it in one second.  But thats not taking in to account surface area.  Now you are limited by the number of bots that can fit on the surface at any time which cuts the number down immensely.  If you want to continue this example the controller of the nanoswarm would likely perform a cost benefit analysis taking in to account the energy expenditure of an active nanobot the speed required in disassembly the location of bots in relation to the ship etc. and come up with a maximally efficient solution that uses a fraction of the maximum potential.You can apply this to any process.  Do you really need  nanobots welding a rod?  Or can you have  do it in x the time?  If different nanoswarms have different weights for their costbenefit analysis it would be easy to explain why one sends hundreds of bots to kill all intruders but another sends a paltry handful.The above is written assuming that processing power is not a limiting factor.  If it is it becomes much easier to justify.  You may have a swarm of a million bots but if you can only actively manipulate  of them at a time the entire swarm is mostly backdrop for the active components.,eclipsephase,cellqtx,1,t5_2ro1k

5121013,0,t1_cv38ua0,Just to expand on this  theres a noticeable signal delay in the brains processing of sensory data which weve been trained by life experience to compensate for by trying to anticipate things before they happen. Its trivially easy to show this delay by tripping up the anticipation mechanism.Anyway a flat would almost certainly perceive a character acting at Speed  but the majority of the understanding of what that character did would occur retroactively as his brain works through that jumble of sensory data and sorts it into a meaningful sequence  John Flat is drinking his morning coffee then suddenly hes on the floor. Oh thinks John Im on the floor because Francesca Fury just burst through my front door and kicked over my table while I was in the middle of lifting my cup. My god that was fast.,eclipsephase,cv39vzb,12,t5_2ro1k

In modern day terms its more like somebody earned your trust then totaled your car then put you in a coma for weeks on end then you wake up and find you are part of a secret organization and you dont have a choice in the matter.. Its still a very traumatic experience. Thats not a st century experience. Thats a human experience. Dying still sucks in the future. Even if you are immortal.    ,eclipsephase,cwwoazw,2,t5_2ro1k
9733576,0,t1_dacjv8h,Savage Worlds is more crunch than they like.  And less crunch than I like.  So thats kinda the worst of both worlds.,eclipsephase,dacvj3m,2,t5_2ro1k
11203093,0,t3_5zwo17,Top  things  The Exsurgent Virus in all its macabre forms  The varied political situations and how believers have grouped together creating utopian versions of their respective belief systems. And how this allows the exploration of these ideals in an extreme way to find how we could or could not relate to them in our own world and time  SuryasTop Meta thing about Eclipse Phase  The metaphor of serial immortality merges so well with the loss of a player character and the player just creating another,eclipsephase,df1utxr,10,t5_2ro1k
11433635,0,t1_df5dsab,Thank you for doing the maths for me.I already knew they were totally insane hell ignore the science for a moment. Economics. Who developed this morph? Why?? How long did it take?? Are spaceships even necessary when you have this level of magical biotech? Also who pays to ship water to this place? Why?? but its nice to have the hard numbers down.The idea of the sun being a livable space to any creature not itself made out of plasma is just ridiculous and a weird break from the otherwise very hard nature of the setting.Its a shame because i actually really like the little Salamander morphs. I think they look really cool  whoever did the art on them did a bangup job. They manage to look elven almost. I think they might actually be my favourite morph in the entire game  just the wonderful mixture of their looks the graceful nature of their cyberware implants and their idea as a creature that lives off solar energy. Awesome.Ill have to headcanon a reason for them to keep on being cool someday. Maybe theyre just a long term vacmorph for people who want to live outside space habitats its not like the solar system dont get enough solar energy even away from the sun guys. ,eclipsephase,dfrzoof,2,t5_2ro1k
