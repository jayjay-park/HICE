The website is interesting and includes a lot of information on the projectFireballs in the sky  is an extension of the DFN and if I understand it correctly it allows for people to set up their own cameras to extend the DFN. Their is also an ap to allow for meteorite sightings to be reported and video recorded on your phone as well as allowing access to the DFN data.CAMS  is a NASA array of cameras for fireball detection. Like the Australian system it seems designed to allow for the addition of your own cameras to the system. This page describes how to set up your CAMS camera and join the CAMS network. Interestingly the CAMS project webpage seems to be run by SETIThe American Meteor Society  AMS maintains a list of atomatic sky recording cameras operated by AMS membersA quick click around that site and a google search came up with this company selling video capture software suitable for sky cameras This is the webpage of another Australian Automatic Meteor Detection SystemI am sure you can see the overlap between an array of cameras designed to detect meteors and an array for detecting any unidentified object in the sky.

He explained the laughable claims of all the alien contact cults as people that were given partially true information to convince them of the supernormal capacities of the entities then they progressively fed them more and more false information culminating in a claim that some big reveal would happen on x day at y place which obviously never happened and then the cults and the people were left looking like plain nutjobs.Keels own experience was that they played along with his theories of what they were and what they were planning to do and later they would do something different to completely make him rethink what was going on.

Punishments for violating secrecy in the US include  fine and decades in prison for releasing even mundane information. Unless you go full retard and say that every case of claimants of this nature are true since the government doesnt go after them.

But Lazar was said to be part of a team to attempt to reverse engineer the disk shaped craft piloted by grey aliens from a star system  light years. These are two different sightings. Its an interesting dynamic whenever undisclosed terrestrial aircraft are seen by public the cover of aliens or ET ufos is used or insinuated even after the famous Lights over Phoenix event the Mayor came out with a guy dressed up in an alien costume! lol and the flares were used to distract attention away from the actual sighting of the triangular craft earlier that night. If Bob did work at the secret facility and now came out very publicly Id guess those involved would either take action of . killing him or family making it look like a suicide or by accident see the Phil Schneider death or . discredit him. They might have chosen the latter this time around. Actually I want someone to show me where Lazar claims he studied at MIT. Show me. In the late s there was a video called NASA UFOS which showed footage of video from NASA missions allegedly showing alien spacecraft the guy went all in to explain how these alien spaceships worked. Later on it was shown thru experiment in a lab how the same type of disc shaped spaceship shapes are recreated as part of debris in the field of where the camera was filming in space and thereby debunking this guys theory on the that particular video he focused on for me at least.

2622219,0,t3_2pwexo,I think that people have become more used to seeing things in the sky.  That might make it harder to notice a UFO since it could be any number of things.  Back before the days of Sputnik the stars would have looked pretty static.   Now theres drones satellites etc.  The criteria for what is an interesting sighting seems to have been pushed much higher in the present.  Also despite the advantage that social media and the internet gives us we are still in an age of secrecy.  Theres a lot of stuff from the s and before that can be substantiated because of documents that came out during the Carter administration.  After Reagan came into power it became much harder for researchers to get previously classified documents.  Without more access to official records most cases come down to the creditability of the witness and peoples person bias. I think that UFO reports are actually happening at a higher rate than ever.  That may not reflect the number of actual legitimate sightings though.  Theres a lot of evidence that sightings go up when the subject is tied to something hot in pop culture like the XFiles show.  ,UFOs,cn0v139,2,t5_2qhds

3247098,0,t3_2xaf5l,What do I believe? Belief isnt the right word. My views are based on reason so I call it my determination from the evidence. My determination is that something really fucking weird is going on. Its not only weirder than we imagine its weirder than we can imagine. The government of the US at least knows it is real but they dont know what it is. This is what I consider to be the most logical answer to the coverup conundrum.gtDo you think aliens have been visiting us?My position is that Im surprised that there isnt solid evidence for ET visitation of the Earth at least in the past. And there isnt any evidence other than circumstantial reports. I would like to believe that UFO reports represent ETs and part of me does believe that but another part of me rejects it because human minds are prone to hallucination delusion and deception. Witness reports are not only notoriously unreliable theyre usually completely wrong. Out of all the reports there are still a handful that make me go hmm but theres no testable evidence to go on. I suspect that truly alien intelligence would be so strange and bizarre that we might not even be able to recognise it as such. Very advanced technology might not be observable to us. Our own current technology would be utterly mind boggling to humans from only a century ago so I think tech thousands of years in advance might simply be beyond our perception. gtAre you a skeptic?When I was young I was a True Believer but once I learned the basics of logic and rational thought I realised that the majority of UFO stories are hoaxes delusion nonsense. The belief in UFO lore by many in this little cultural group is akin to religious mania and is quite obnoxious and despicable from a rational viewpoint. It also is the biggest obstacle to actually understanding what genuinely anomalous unidentified aerial phenomena really represent so it naturally makes me rather angry. Only a small percentage of UFO reports a very rare fraction are genuinely unexplainable. Skepticism is not a bad thing it is hugely beneficial to this field and more people should be skeptical because it allows us to filter the false material from the genuine. Being a debunker however for the sake of debunking is the position of a dolt. gt Do you believe in ancient alien theory?No. Humans are extraordinary in their ability to create amazing things and always have been. Ancient man was just as clever as we are and just as creative and determined. Trying to explain ancient artefacts by invoking aliens is doing our ancestors a grave injustice. The Ancient Aliens theory was largely concocted by people like Erich von Dniken who had to fudge the evidence or make things up to get it to sound promising. The field hasnt changed since that time. Like I said Id expect to see evidence of ET visitation in the historic record but all the evidence presented for it so far has been utter piffle. gtAre there any cases that you personally truly believed happened and were actually aliens?There are cases that I believe are genuine but Im not going to say they represent ET visitation because Im not completely sold on the ExtraTerrestrial Hypothesis ETH. It may be cultural projection. Im willing to say I think some rare cases may be evidence of nonhuman intelligence but I wouldnt go further than that. gtDo you think that the government actually has alien bodiescrafts?No. Because they would have used this technology by now. They havent. All claims to the contrary can be disproven.I think the US government were completely stumped by UFOs and the main motivation has been to keep this bafflement hidden from the public at large. I think this explains a great deal. Stories of recovered bodies have an interesting theme that seems to be coherent but they also closely resemble the way folklore emerges. Most of these stories have been heavily embellished and in most cases you can trace them back to highly questionable origins.Ill wait to see if these alleged alien slides from  actually show something definitively nonhuman when theyre released in May but Im not holding my breath. I suspect that if any government did recover materiel or bodies from a nonterrestrial source that that material would be a psychological operation  in other words part of a deception  by a nonhuman intelligence. We really cant take anything at face value.,UFOs,coykj9t,1,t5_2qhds
3269980,0,t1_cp0zt5t,I would not say there has been zero effort. There are a lot of natural experiments. And there are plenty of astronomers looking at the night sky. And there are radar operators. Lots of incidental stuff. When a phenomena has the pattern that UFOs have conclusions can be drawn. The better the camera the further away the UFO. The more photos taken the rarer the UFOs become. All the incidental data points to ordinary aerial phenomena being photographed at or just beyond the limits of the camera in question.If the camera was a little better you would see it was a bird. And when were talking about cameraphones zoomed to the maximum and then optical zoom on top of it all we are seeing is edge cases of refraction between lenses.,UFOs,cp10609,1,t5_2qhds

It woud require further digging to know if the goverment of Chile announced some form of operation of training over Santiago that night or whether or not it was announced after the fact to cover up any strange activity. I believe there is something strange going on in the videos regardless of formation or precedent of the lights on the objects. Theres no blue and red lights to be seen that I remember that would identify the left and right wings of the aircraft. And at one point they all seem to hover simultaneously until they take off at one time. I dont think wind has anything to do with this and the objects ability to hover. After their hovering I believe the video may cut as it seems the aforementioned objects may turn into multiple small objects. The video is interesting regardless of what one may believe the lights in the sky over Santiagp Chile may actually be.,UFOs,cp9epuh,4,t5_2qhds

3428729,0,t1_cpj02x1,This. Nice pull. The tendency to think we have to make a false choice bt psychic and physical is a deadend. Moreover and as exemplified by the events at Skinwalker Ranch more and more serious investigators in their respective fields are coming to see all manner of the paranormal and anomalous as sharing many common characteristics and as all of a piece. Doesnt really matter whether you account for such as spiritual multidimensional or multiversal...it all comes down to reality being more profound than the limitations placed on it by any simple rendering we might try to give it. And as McKenna pointed out one of the really serious implications of the quantum revolution was that the observer effect puts our experiences back to front and center. Because of this very real dependency upon us for everything we think we know you can hardly take the psyche out of the equation. The mistake was only in ever thinking that somehow reality could be independent of us or we of it.  ,UFOs,cpj3n07,3,t5_2qhds

3539409,0,t1_cpulpjo, Exactly. There are so many cultural differences that cannot be communicated with just our language. Many people may believe they are devils. We need something to help mediate as an ambassador and bridge the gap in us comprehending their perception. I think they are waiting for a solid A.I to be readily available and explaintranslate on a level we understand. So it would probably be our A.I talking to their A.I at first. If you are talking about everyday computer interaction. So I think we got  years or less before we all get to understand the price of admission to the galactic community. It has to be a community. If there are civilizations then there has to be some form of group cohesion. This would also explain the lack of communication by a single species in a way that breaks the rules of communication. Its clear that many species have made some contact with a small group of humans but not a single one to the human race at large. This could indicate that there is some type of rule system in place. It really makes sense considering how much time has passed that we are living within a very old and well established galactic state of some sort. I have seen video of ufos getting shot and and dodging projectiles in the upper atmosphere. We probably have certain requirements as a species if we are to enter the galactic community. This probably involves something we have to do in order to leave and colonize beyond our solar system or in the most extreme a requirement in order to colonize any planet including within our solar system. Nuclear weapons would have to go for one. There is a lot of interest in our weapons we are savage and we cant have anything that can cause destruction. If it was possible that nuclear weapons were allowed then it would mean very aggressive species could dominate. The reason why I dont think aggressive species rein entirely is because we have developed past the point where an invasion would have been the most successful. We would put up a fight better today than  years ago there would also have been much less damage to the ecosystem by us and would have made a better home for an invading species. ,UFOs,cpvpr67,2,t5_2qhds

Also check out this video from NASA its very informative.As uhorsearchitect and I have been trying to describe the vertical velocity isnt what is really that important when considering getting into orbit.  Youre balloon would get you close to the edge of space but youd have essentially zero horizontal velocity.  Youd have to have kms of delta V on your balloon to get into orbit.  A bit more than that actually since you cant apply  of that fuel to horizontal motion.Im also not sure you mean escape velocity.  Escape velocity for our planet is kms and that will get you out of Earths gravitational influence not exactly what I think youre looking for.,UFOs,crddu96,1,t5_2qhds

4605047,0,t1_ctazw86,I think all life here and now is that first tiny alien life along with smatterings more throughout time coevolved in the space and element deposit within this particular gravity well solar system. I think once in a while debris from previous planets flows by and occasionally tiny specs from those events find us. I think once in a while some survives entry. I think we are the proof itll just take a while to prove that we need more samples. Some are under review currently and weve had candidates before. Im not going to be shocked when it turns out we wont solve our origins entirely here. Primary evolutionary grounds? Yep think so. But I think there may be help from essentially space algae space tardigrades or some radiation event that changed primary chirality of organic material naturally evolving in complex extreme conditions already on earth.

4647899,0,t3_3emu1s,So I work at a daycare and we were outside with the kids. We have a small rooftop garden and it was a clear sunny day. I looked up and saw many small floating objects appear from behind the building across the railway tracks.It was pretty high up and first I thought someome released balloons and my work mate saw them too. We thought nothing of it but they all  were floating sideways together in a group. I found a picture pretty similar to what I saw. Not imcluding the meteor There was no noise no planes in sight. They looked like stars in the middle of the day. They were not all round some were oddly shapped and different sizes. If they were balloons they would have not moved sideways all together. They stopped in the middle of the sky and slowly faded away.Now I am a huge sceptic. But this has been on my mind since it happened in June on my birthday. I spoke to someone from the observatory and they cant explain it either. This was in SydneyAustralia in the cityFound a picture of the building.

5025428,0,t3_3jkk6b, I assume certain things just based upon how the government reacts or doesnt react. For example. The last time I think the government didnt know about who or what was piloting these ships was during the Battle of Los Angeles Now fast forward today and take a look at their behavior during the Phoenix lights incident where the military ended up dropping flares at one point. Flares intended to mask the event which means they knew there was something that needed to be masked. Thats a big difference in behavior. Also consider...Why isnt there a firstcontact.gov? It seems like there should be etiquette that the government would want to convey. Or a place to report sightings directly to the government. So basically my assumption is this....If the government didnt know what they were they would either be shooting at them or trying to get the public involved in identifying them. Both of which has happened in the past although briefly and now all we have is silence. ,UFOs,curr7f8,2,t5_2qhds

5086579,0,t1_cuxn16r,Okay Im here been a long week at my new job but I have some time now to try and detail an encounter.Ill go with my first encounter.Be me. Male late twenties atheist army veteran. The year is .Relaxing in bed in the evening.Youtubing reading up on Dwarf Fortress guides randomly browsing the internetSomething hits me hard mentally right in the middle of my forehead about an inch into my brain. Press your thumb to your forehead now and keep applying pressure and wiggling your thumb around circles back and forth up and down etc. Now imagine a bit of a wet feeling on your thumbskin contact and imagine a bit of electricity added to the sensation. Now imagine that feeling about an inch deep into your brain. Imagine the sensations pressure becoming more powerful and imagine it becoming less powerful. Basically add a bunch variables to this sensation that can be tweaked in real time to create a sort of impromptu non verbal language.This is telepathy. Without any warning whatsoever and I am being pinged by another intelligence being. My third eye is online. I didnt know what a third eye was at this point.So a being is communicating with me right now and the feeling is undeniable all doubt has left. Why has doubt left? Because of the sensation. Obviously at this point my mind is racing and looking for an explanation. But the new sensation that the telepathy has put in my mind is pleasurable. So basically it goes like thisrandom thoughtsI must be dreaming...  sensation slightly dulls and then comes back to baselineThis isnt really happening...  sensation slightly dullsbaselinesIm hallucinating...  dullsbaselinesIm imagining this... dullsbaselinesThis is real!  sensation blooms powerfully then baselinesYou are real!  sensation blooms again then baselinesThis is a contact  same as abovelots of mental excitementNow imagine this back and forth sensation just rapidly synchronizing with my thought patterns at the time so that we formed a language. I would think something the sensation would do any number of non verbal variables to change its intensity. This allowed for a very profound communication between myself and the being.Now add the variable of my computer still being on my lap I have my pillows propped behind me basically in a nice relaxing evening internet browsing position. My computers screen gets pulled into this whirlwind experience. It becomes a display for information the being wants me to see and understand with greater detail than the telepathy would allow for at the time. Our link stays synchronized with what I now see on my monitor.This is the flow. I am able to use my computer just like normal. Clicking changing what I seen on screen etc. Except now I have a guide in my mind using the hotcold telepathic game to lead me on. I am directed to many informative educational videos that pertain to higher dimensional concepts and life. I think I was jacked into a higher dimensional internet because none of this stuff I can find on our internet. I see a video that shows a scene of space and stars with a majestic looking whale of great intelligence swimming through it. Then a shark of similar size with all sorts of technology enters the scene. There is a rivalry for sure but no physical violence is shown. I also see a scene of an extraterrestial being much like one of the greys except tall like a human. The being is walking through a park on a pathway holding the hand of a much smaller ET that looks identical to it. This is its child they are enjoying their day out together. This simple scene COMPLETELY OBLITERATED all preconceptions I ever had about aliens. I used to think of aliens and think spaceships spacewars abductions etc and now suddenly I am seeing a very humanizing soulful and familiar look at a nonhuman being walking the love of its life through a path in a grassy park. Mind blown oh by the way the emotions felt in this first contact were just as vivid as the telepathy itself if not more.We go on and on for most likely hours. I develop a bond with this being. But its getting late I am getting tired and eventually the feeling leaves me not without first implying feelings to me of goodbye and see you again soon.That was night one of a series of educational experiences about multidimensional concepts life and spirituality and the universe.Each night the being came back for about a week straight.Now your turn feel free to ask anything and I will let you control the flow now.edita separate and simple encounter  at least month or so later after my firstbe me mid day cold enough outside to make me want to build a fireI get the wood all ready arrange the kindling nicely get the fire going and have a log on top just starting to burn.Nothing out of the ordinary at this point no telepathy just have an urge to put a single piece of newspaper on top of the log. I do so and watch it light up in flames. Now the communication begins. I have a sudden sensation of an angel burning up in flames and ascending. A voice tells me to falls backwards I am just sitting in front of the fireplace on the ground at this point. I obey the voice and fall backwards. THE MOST INTENSE EXPERIENCE EVER HAPPENS NOW.I feel layers and layers of reality open up before my eyes almost like a wormhole or a tunnel but filled with light and colors and I feel something reach down from a very high place and touch me right on the head.

5289574,0,t3_3nfu0u,For Aboriginals who have a unique and romantic perspective on existence called Dreamtime it is pretty common to perceive UFO style logic when taking their philosophy about Dreamtime literally. If you talk to a real Aboriginal you immediately understand that the Dreamtime is all encompassing and highly interpretive even amongst themselves. It often translates into English in a way that seems literal when they are actually talking in a descriptive or  artistic sense meant to force your mind to think creatively. They view reality in a much more th dimensional way than Western society does. And that permeates their culture. It is actually very beautiful. But just as The Giant Devil Dingo dreamtime story speaks of mans domestication of the dingo and not of actual giant dingos it is often incorrect to assume literal translations of their stories. The author of that article even seems to indicate that. Often eyewitness accounts may be stories of eyewitness accounts or even through the perspective of another personanimalthe environment.If you are going to take flying spirits as signs of literal UFOs then you have to also explain a literal rainbow serpent and all the other figurative beings in their dreamtime lore.If you want to go down that rabbit hole with dreamtime I suggest starting with the mimi A white thin inter dimensional race of beings that apparently taught ancient Aboriginals how to use fire paint cook meat etc...,UFOs,cvnt06f,10,t5_2qhds

6864552,0,t1_d0ue5a1,gt what is the simplest answer?There isnt enough evidence to come to a determination. More study is needed.gtThese objects do not resemble any known thing This is not true for one thing human observational skills are poor in a satellite reentry over Russia witnesses drew detailed pictures of rocketlike craft or saucers with portholes. The real reentry looked like a trail of sparks. Heres an example. Theres no doubt about this it is an empirical fact. The majority of genuinely anomalous UFO sightings are lights in the form of spheres. This does resemble known phenomena namely plasma or electrical phenomena all of which are ubiquitous and have been observed for centuries if not thousands of years.Where UFOs become really interesting is their apparent intelligent control and responses but this is another discussion and I dont want to get off track. The point is where people describe detailed nuts and bolts objects that they interpret as technological there is enough doubt due to human perceptual error and projection to question whether their reports are accurate.At all stages of the historical UFO enigma witnesses have described the objects they saw in terms of technology that was current in society at the time. For example during the late th Century airship waves over the US people believed the lights they saw in the sky were dirigibles and airships.Is it a coincidence that at the dawn of the rocket era and nascent space exploration that people started seeing what they thought were spaceships? I put it to you that they could be any number of different things from plasmic phenomena to strange distortions in spacetime or even living entities. We simply do not have enough evidence to say what they really are. The most popular interpretation of UFOs right now is that they are alien spaceships but there are at least a dozen other possible explanations. In many ways the extra terrestrial hypothesis ETH for UFOs fails to explain all of the phenomena associated with some reports and many UFOlogists have to massage the data to make it fit the ETH. gtThe only conceivable way to travel in space involves spacecraft.Thats an incredibly humancentric and eracentric idea. How do you know that in maybe a century or two we will develop some kind of wormhole technology or EM conduit that makes a nuts and bolts craft obsolete? These ideas are already theoretically possible in physics. Would someone in the th Century be able to conceive of todays most advanced space craft technology? Of course not they were still imagining you could fly to the moon in a balloon.My point is dont make assumptions about physics or the advance of technology. Right now we are sending space craft into our local solar system and putting robots on other planets. Naturally then we expect to see that from other nonhuman intelligences but this is a huge leap since we firstly dont know how nonhuman intelligence will manifest and secondly we dont know what new discoveries well make in physics in the next few centuries which might make our current technologies completely obsolete. gtWe wont be the most advanced civilisation in the universe. We wont be the ones to discover alien life before it discovers us.Those two statements are also highly controversial. We just dont have the evidence to make any such determination. When we look at our local galaxy we see absolutely nothing that indicates the presence of highly advanced civilisations when the most conservative estimates suggest life should be teeming  out there. Why? Nobody knows.In short dont project. ,UFOs,d0ueoap,3,t5_2qhds

What he lacks on scientific method and thinking a la Vallee he more than makes up for with his knowledge of Fortean subject matters and overall entertaining writing style.While I think a lot of what he says is a bit far fetched I enjoy it nonetheless if only for something different to think about or consider.  I especially like his theory regarding the superspectrum and how its been responsible for pretty much all the odd shit happening since time immemorial.  That includes paranormal UFOs fairies etc.If you like UFO books you must ABSOLUTELY read the Mothman Prophecies at the very least.  IMO its one of his best books.

As you said evolutionary biology means that we evolved here on Earth and no where else.  It is  provable that for the last  million years we progressed from chimps to man.  To have blonds come from the Pleiades or Venus is absurd.  Unless they are capable of transforming into human form there is no chance that they are from either of those places.  Greys are more believable.  Reptilians are less because once again an earthly creature. Note to humans its impossible for the tree of life that came to be on Earth happened anywhere else in this Universe.  Multiverses and parallel universes aside in this Universe the series of steps required is like a chess game.  After the first X moves every game is unique as in the combinations create complexity that make the game unique.  This is true of life as well and you can say that the steps to get to a mollusk are unique and just as well the unique steps to get to reptiles birds pigs humans etc are impossible to randomly happen on another planet.

The sceptics take a hard stand on one side and the believers on the other and when discussing things with strangers on the internet both sides instead of entertaining the possibility that the other side has a valid point would rather double down.  instead of accepting that the other side has a point even if it does not lead to a change in beliefs.

8490263,0,t1_d62ratu,If youre trying to support your own conspiracy you probably shouldnt reference your own reddit thread but instead use some peerreviewed papers or research done by credible sources. Now Im not even going to touch the materialists from the s topic because I have no interest in learning about a conspiracy devised to make people such as yourself more paranoid about the societal structure surrounding you. Regarding NASA and scientific bias towards not supporting the Alien Megastructure idea Of course. Really? You think scientists should try to support such an incredible claim before explaining it with a more natural phenomena if you catch my drift? The idea that this is pseudoscience because it threatens the mainstream is absurd. A deeper understanding of the scientific method itself with reveal this to you. Do you remember when a team of scientists reported measurements of a neutrino travelling faster than the speed of light? That threatened to overthrow relativity! The scientific community while split welcomed replication by other institutes and looked deep into the experiment to find it there was something unaccounted for. It was exciting because something scientists thought was simply a fact of the universe was on the brink of getting thrown out the window. In the end they verified that a loose cable was the result but in no way were people influenced to falsify or attack the result because of the accepted norm. Many scientists were highly skeptical of the result and they were right. But if the experiment were replicated the paradigm would have shifted regardless of this s materialistic conspiracy you believe in. I am neither intellectually dishonest nor ignorant to the subject. Perhaps there were some who believed the observations were not of good quality but the scheduling on telescopes does not allow a follow up measurement immediately unless there was something truly unbelievable. A stars light fluctuating in a strange pattern which by coincidence agrees with philosophical speculation of an alien superstructure doesnt exactly scream urgent. There will be follow up observations at some point but it does not NEED to be now nor SHOULD it be now. If scientific communities and operators of the telescopes deem it to be a worth endeavor they will receive time on the telescope. But if in their proposal they say Repeat observations of alien megastructure I am sure they will not receive the time because they demonstrate their inability to follow the scientific method. Scientific organizations dont follow the whim of reporters or even scientists. There needs to be rigorous examination modelling theorizing and evidence to support a theory. A telescope which is contested for time by astronomers all over the world will not bend their scientific goals because a small group suggest a farout theory.  If they can irrefutably explain that no current theory can explain this light curve THEN and likely only then will they receive follow up observation time to further investigate this. Edit My UFOboner.com comment was directed toward the sources you use to support your argument not you yourself.

There is possibly another psychological aspect at play where someone has a genuine experience and then gets some attention for that and so pressure builds on them to confabulate more stories or become a source of knowledge or to gain more attention.

8827198,0,t1_d76u1w6,This is what I have read from someone that analyzed it.That is what we have with the UFO video which proves an expensive camera filmed it. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? Because that alone proves that whatever this UFO was was close to the rocket and not a nearby bird. If it was a nearby bird it might not have shown up in the image at all because the lens on that type of camera has a depth of field which blurs anything that has a distance significantly different than what the lens is focusing on. Since the focus on both the rocket and the UFO are virtually identical it proves the UFO was much larger than any bird and close to the rocket. Any bird that was close enough to the camera to show up that big would have been so out of focus it might not even noticeably show up in the frame if it was moving that fast.

The behavior of both the machine and the occupants appears to be consistent with the idea that we are faced with an alien form of life. However their behavior is not consistent either with what you would expect from space visitors or with what we know about physics. Thats the dilemma.There is sloppy work in this field and it doesnt set a good example. But the decent work that has been done is impressive. My point was that experienced researchers are aware of the significance of the available reliable evidence and what it means Vallee included.

9106221,0,t3_54im59,Im new here so please forgive me if I am out of line.  I think that the general idea that a person can believe in UFOs or extraterrestrials is problematic and asking anyone who doesnt study this subject of UAPs if they believe will result in answers that are impossible to interpret. Ive seen at least  and possibly  and I am comfortable saying that what I saw was not an airplane or standard aircraft.  But even if I were sitting in the drivers seat of a UFO receiving personal instructions from an alien I dont think that I would be comfortable saying that I believe in anything.  I can say I know that UFOs exist comfortably though.  When those words I believe in are strung together for any purpose the subject matter is fringeified instantly.  I think that in the minds of many people belief is something that doesnt require any evidence.  Some people who believe in god do so without any evidence and others believe in god because they feel that theyve experienced things that support their believe.  Regardless of whether you need evidence or not to believe in something belief is very personal and its unlikely that a question or discussion about the belief in UFOs will yield persuasive arguments to convince a nonbeliever to believe.  A better more productive discussion IMHO is to discuss the possibility andor probability that life exists in other places and then discuss what people are seeing in the skys.  Leaving the phrase believe in might move the discussion in a different direction without immediately polarizing  everyone into believers vs nonbelievers. ,UFOs,d86f6tp,2,t5_2qhds

10024467,0,t1_db62tnl,As a scuba diver and a person who has family that worked on s s and s era submarines there is nothing I know that I cant say but lots of things that I dont know. Submarine people are tight lipped but SO much of this technology is widely known and has been blown wide open through Tom Clancy books and other stuff. Something I do know for a fact is that submarine depths are a really weird edge case where you do not want divers in there with the boat and yet you dont want an extremely deep sea floor and an uncertain bottom either. In other words waters that are safe amp shallow enough to dive in would be very dangerous to operate a big diesel or small nuclear steam powered boat. Those same waters would absolutely positively not be where youd send a crew out to do anything like maneuvers such as this. In this ftft water going by what the charts say though I bet it is quite a bit deeper in that area I am very seriously doubting that theres anything to the reports of scheduled submarine ops happening right there. Its too shallow and its god damn dangerous to send anything nuclear steam powered to operate that close to land in. I do like the accidental Aurora drop theory though. That they dropped it too far southeast that is. The satellite was off the mark. I like that a lot more than the concept that they would be doing anything routine there off Shag Harbor involving submarines.,UFOs,dbe7s9b,1,t5_2qhds

She claimed that an antigravity effect could be produced by rotating ions creating a gravitomagnetic field perpendicular to their spin axis. In her theory if a large number of ions could be aligned in a BoseEinstein condensate the resulting effect would be a very strong gravitomagnetic field producing a strong repulsive force. The alignment may be possible by trapping superconductor ions in a lattice structure in a hightemperature superconducting disc. Li claimed that experimental results confirmed her theories.The Popular Mechanics magazine article about Ning Li where I first heard about her was from October .There are some shockings articles out today about an apparently successful technique to create high temp superconductors from hydrogen metal. ,UFOs,dcypqtg,1,t5_2qhds

11262814,0,t1_df8lm6s,gtIt wouldnt work because the data available is so tenuous and cant be checked. Computers arent magic they need accurate information to work. Garbage in garbage out.Definitely agree with you. The better the data the better the output. Theres two scenarios I imagine possibly playing out regarding it  We collect the best data we can with as many measurements and numbers possible patterns of sightings flight characteristics etc. Pull the trigger and see what happens though it may be inconclusive.  We dont have to do anything. The AGI will be sufficiently advanced enough that it can study the phenomena entirely on its own. This is the best case scenario and possibly inevitable. As it studies its surroundings it will eventually discover the mystery if it can be detected by it.gtIsaac Asimov wrote a nice tale about using a supercomputer to discover the nature of humour. The machine concluded it was of extraterrestrial origin and this discovery led to humour no longer working presumably because the aliens needed humanity to be unaware of their influence.Oh geeze. Well Ive actually read a little bit of Asimov but what Im getting here is I need to read more scifi. I apologize if much of this seems like old hat haha.,UFOs,df8mgcn,1,t5_2qhds

I happenened to be on that forum the day he wrote that last post ... check out his past posts for yrs he never even mentioned it ... until the day he left and he explains why this was the caseI still dont know what to think but Im inclined to think hes telling the Truth!gt  he said the reason that the BTs are always hanging out so low to the ground late at night is because they are harvesting dreams.Not exactly harvesting dreamsReading star maps that some? people have recorded in their brains which can compute courses even AIs cant to map out FTL jumps in spaceIIRC he says our brains are far more powerfulcapable than we know and their best computers!IMHO I think its true esp in light of the Secret Space Program thats been mentioned by several different sources He also said his group RK has offered to help TPTB but theyve been turned down for various reasonsInterestingly the stuff Corey Goode talks about in some ways half fits in with what Astr saidGreat story even if its not true but I hope it is,UFOs,dgugcsz,1,t5_2qhds
