Its a  minute online series by some of the same guysgals who worked on Adventure time. Penn Ward helped develop it so its got some randomweird humor in it. If something doesnt make you laugh it means you dont think its funny. Fuck what those other guys think. Go watch mlp. tldr go watch a different cartoon yo,cartoons,cggarps,5,t5_2r4sk

Its pretty sad when your subreddit is less active than the equivalent Gamefaqs board. Its just Western animation thats short changed too  ranime is plenty active.,cartoons,coipg8t,2,t5_2r4sk

10506931,0,t3_5q07f8,If comparable to Jimmy Newtron it doesnt sound too bad for kids. I used to find it funny and kids like that humor. There have been better adventure shows on CW years ago. CW seems to have had a bunch of the type of shows you mentioned that are rehashed.If CN is getting rid of this show it just means they are experimenting like you said. Although it seems more in line with the trend of shows on other networks to have a silly moralistic tool for children. Maybe  its not your kind of entertainment as an adult. Theyre all like that now including Steven Universe We Bear Bares and Teen TitansGo. The styles do differ mostly because of the writing and POV of the writers. Moral shows with silly entertainment can be good for children.I dunno about variety in timeslots but maybe its not needed if people tune in at certain hours before school. Plus new episodes are coming out for these new shows so it makes sense to advertise.,cartoons,dcz2ln2,1,t5_2r4sk
