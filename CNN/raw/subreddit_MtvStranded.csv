11279962,1,t3_60s2ww,Makani and Cody come off looking like extremely vile and hypocritical in pretty much every episode.  Theyre lucky the group isnt cutting them off completely.  When you treat the person that controls the money like crap youre motivating them to spend however much they need to get to the end.  That said the other group started off as the nice guys and banded together to fight off the bullying but theyre slowly stooping to MakaniCodys level so theres no one to cheer for on the show anymore.That said those  are going to be much more interesting on The Challenge than the rest of the group.  Theyre definitely the better physical competitors.,MtvStranded,dfakfg3,-4,t5_3jbw1

11361518,0,t3_60wd95,During the competition did you ever feel like you were wasting money when you participated in a few temptations? Was it part of your strategy to demoralize the other alliance or did you truly feel the need to spend the  on a temptation instead of buying cheaper food at a group buy?,MtvStranded,dfjt24u,3,t5_3jbw1

11371581,0,t1_dfkxbgp,i dont want to distract from your question because i want to know the answer as well but just to add i would have loved to see Cody try to destroy them from within and give makani food on the side. he would be like the trojan horse,MtvStranded,dfky4do,6,t5_3jbw1
11471312,0,t3_63ocp2,This guy is the most embarrassing excuse for a competitor Ive ever seen so happy Im not alone in the hate I hope I never see him or any of the campers on any challenge show ever. ,MtvStranded,dfw9nee,18,t5_3jbw1
11551657,0,t1_dg5dqft,So true! Less money MTV has to pay out. Im sure they dont mind the ripping. Doesnt MTV pay about  a week or something on the Real World? I wonder if Stranded members get a weekly sum of money just for being there. ,MtvStranded,dg5dtl5,6,t5_3jbw1
11564576,0,t1_dg6uad1,I really hope so! Id be curious to see how theyd do in the Challenge. I know the rookies from AYTO get a lot of shit for not having to prove physical strengthendurance before getting on the challenge but the same cant really be said for stranded. ,MtvStranded,dg6ultx,3,t5_3jbw1

11579452,0,t3_6587sm,I think shes butthurt about not getting peanut butter and jumped on the first opportunity to make him seem like he treats women poorly to be spiteful. Really scummy move considering that Cody was the only one who gave a shit when Gina was basically drowning. ,MtvStranded,dg8jcto,17,t5_3jbw1

Technically you can take ANYTHING to court in the US but what youre talking about is a civil suit and would be laughed the hell out of the court house as a frivolous lawsuit. Just drop it. ,MtvStranded,dgk7etz,1,t5_3jbw1
