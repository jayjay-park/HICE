9527,0,t3_1u7r4w,I like heartseaker bc of the pure damage and move speed it gives you.  The move speed isnt much but it allows you to catch up  out run people that do not have it.  Also the damage you can get is huge.  I almost always build it asap use it early game to max benefit but have often had to sell it late game once we go into full on team fight mode and I get focused out of every fight.  That being said by the time I need to sell it I generally have enough to finish the new item any way.  I do base it off of what the other team hasis doing.  If I am going up against a high kill lane and can tell they are on my level I will skip it but if I trust that I am handily going to win my lane I will build it. I generally start starter item and boots so I know by the time I can get it if I want or dont want it.  As with any item you have to decide based on situations and every game is going to be slightly different. ,smitetraining,cefiqde,2,t5_2z88k

351568,0,t3_1xw3fl,And what about this?I play Sobek often if not the most. Since I started using him my WL ratio on Conquest started going up and I ALWAYS bring Meditation.The thing is that even on duo lane Sobek seems to waste a BIG chunk of mana helping clear minion waves since his early damage output it horrendous and if I attempt to kill waves with auto attacks even with the help of an early ADC I get EASILY harrassed by enemy gods. Meditation for me has been a godsent and it has let me solo Titans with AMC and Sobek.,smitetraining,cfh7hch,1,t5_2z88k
538930,0,t3_20axqd,I had this problem when I first started playing MOBAs. Im relatively new to Smite but Ive played DOTA HON and League of Legends a lot.Knowing your strengthweaknessThis is probably the biggest key in every MOBA. Can you fight that guy and win? What items does he have? How many kills does he have? These are all questions you should ask yourself anytime you might think theres a fight coming.Wards win fights and gamesWards are like little security cameras you place in the jungle areas. They show you whats going on in that area on the map. Why is this important? Well lets say youre playing one of the solo lane in conquest and you place a ward in one of the areas and sure enough you see the enemy jungler moving toward you. That cheeky bastard was trying to come and kill you and that ward saved your life. Well worth the  gold you spent on it.Its ok to not get a killLets say your playing someone like Chaac in solo. Hes got really good wave clear he kills minions fast and his  heals you so he can sit there for a long time. If youre not confident enough to go all in on someone just poke them down by attacking them with a skill or something. If they cant heal back up they have to go back to their base while you can stay and get more gold and experience from minions. If you do this a couple of times the next thing you know youre  levels higher than them and they cant get anywhere near you.Know when to group up with your teamKilled the enemys tower in your lane? Awesome go help your other lanes do the same. Every tower you destroy is money in everyones pocket. If everyones getting more gold then everyone is stronger. The stronger your team is the more fights you win. Lastly have fun. Dont take it too serious. So many people get into MOBAs and dont enjoy them because they get stressed out or whatever. Just enjoy learning the game and playing.,smitetraining,cg1j7b5,1,t5_2z88k
566415,0,t3_20lutn,As far as play style goes be extremely cautious. Thanatos is one of the squishiest gods there is so you can die in seconds if caught out of position. This goes for all gods not just Thanatos. DONT CHASE. Now trying to run down an almost dead enemy is fine if you have Sprint a jumpdash or an ability to increase movespeed like Thanatos  but if theyre more than a hit or two away from death let them go. The last thing you want to have happen is to go chasing an enemy and round a corner only to be hit by Anubis  combo. Or run face first into an Ao KuangRaHe Bo ult. Unless you have the area that youre chasing them into warded and you know for absolute cetain that there are no enemies ahead just let it go. Now for items. If youre going to get Devourers Gloves you need to get them early first or second after boots so that you can start building stacks. Having  stacks isnt going to help you late game when enemy assassins and mages can burst you down in a couple seconds.Id take Rage over Malice now that the changed the latter. Malice looks nice but the extra crit from Rage helps more than the extra power from Malice. A well timed crit can be the difference between life and death for a squishy like Thanatos.Id also go with Bloodforge over Asi. Asis passive sounds nice as is if you can use it but if you get to the point where it would activate you need to be hauling ass to safety anyway.,smitetraining,cg4nniy,1,t5_2z88k

In saying that since his transition to a full mage people have had a lot of mixed opinions on him heres mineVulcan has decent clear and nice safe poke with his . Personally I love him in the solo lane starting sash and building him like a magical bruiser.

1276708,0,t3_28pmsy,An alternative to the breastplate of Valour would be the Chronos pendant. These both provide the same  CDR that stacks with shoes of Focus to nicely to hit the cap of . Valour provides more physical defence and maximum mana. Since you were up against Chac and Ullr that doesnt sound like a bad mix the maximum mana works with your book of Thoth for more magical power as well but I cant imagine it would be that much.  of ?  magical power. Pendant provides magical power and MP. This means more damage output and more sustain less backing for mana. There is more damage there than the mana buff from Thoth and Valour. However you would have no defensive items what so ever which may very well be okay depending on how the enemy team plays. All in all it seems like you have a good build with decent power. You should never be using the same build every game but change it depending on the opponents you will be facing I.E if Vulcan was replaced with another physical definitely go for Breastplate of Valour,smitetraining,cid8wkb,2,t5_2z88k

4827844,0,t1_cu2tkhu,It doesnt really do much for your team and other items that can fill that same gap hide of the nemean lion midguardian mail are more effective. You generally also dont want more than  physical defense items just because at that point health contributes more towards effective health than buying more protections. The only real exception is if they have something like  physical on the enemy team and even then I wouldnt go above  physical protection items. I havent seen any toptier support players pick up breastplate of valor in a pretty long time now but since its price got reduced by  gold maybe thatll change but I doubt it.My CORE support build is probably Talaria gt Sovreignty gt Heartward. Most of the time Ill end up picking up Winged wand th item but sometimes in special situations Ill get something like pestilence or midguardiannemian if they have  auto attackers in their team. This all kind of goes out the window if Im playing Ymir Geb or Sylvanus because winged wand is really important for them to survive since that passive gets you out of so many bad situations. Sometimes you can even pick it up rd item after heartward if their magic damage isnt going to be a factor until later in the game like they have a chronos mid  freya adc or something. Most of the time Ill end up with Spirit robe at some point as well and so if I combine that with Winged wand and cdr boots if I ever get to them that ends up at a perfectly capped  cdr.

You wanna goBumbasPen bootsJotuns WrathWinged BladeDeathbringerTitans BaneSell Bumbas  Optional defenceDamageCritAs always your build should be made to suit the game you are in so earlier defence may be better than earlier critdamagemovement speed.A lot of people engage with Ne Zha using their  and then ulting however you should practice landing your ult without your  so that when your ult finished you will return to the position you ulted from which is extremely useful in team fights.Coming out of an ult with your sash still up can often save your skin or hold and opponent in place for your team to follow up with more damage.Landing your ring toss will give you a movement speed boost so use it to chase or escape enemies better.Remember to stack your passive whenever you can by basic attacking minionsenemies and use your  as a means to heal yourself a small amount when needed and to give yourself a good attackspeeddamage buff.I hope this helps.,smitetraining,d2pgffk,5,t5_2z88k

7682897,0,t1_d3f0kq4,Thank you for posting this. Ive always kind of been confused about midgame and whatwhere i should be doing. Thinking of support like tanky CC assassin is a new concept to me but it makes a lot of sense. ,smitetraining,d3fhy95,1,t5_2z88k
7928572,0,t3_4nvad5,Also new to game but my impression from what Ive seen is that Ichaival is for situational use. If you find yourself getting into duels with the other ADC or maybe the jungler you can pick up Ichaival for an advantage in v.Outside v or against nonphysical opponents it doesnt do as much offensively. Its a situational item. ,smitetraining,d478v9x,2,t5_2z88k
8010705,0,t3_4oqr0d,Should be buying Transcendence on Neith.   Could make a case for golden bow but Neith loves abilities.  Neith abilities have massive amount of power behind them and scale off power pretty good.  Good clear early game due these abilities.  Cant see a reason not to buy it apart from maybe arena. Building pure ablity based neith can do it can work.  However you do give up attack speed life steal and crit.  Want to look at the mace tree for most your items if you wanted to do that. ,smitetraining,d4gh7qt,2,t5_2z88k

8345338,0,t1_d5kosz7,gt You should be able to out level and earn them since they are sharing xpgold with one another and youre not.Thats the problem though  both sides junglers have been doing this. If it was a v and I could sit under tower Id be used to that from when I played ages ago but this whole v duo mid early thing is... unfamiliar. Im not sure how to adjust to it. Ive found that a lot of the time because Im used to trying to clear the wave ASAP when Im trying to auto to finish the wave the jungler just grabs it all. As a result I fall behind and sometimes not always its a small snowball that leads to a real snowball. Im trying to figure out if theres a mage I could use or playstyle adjustments of some sort that would allow me to take the v and use it to my advantage.,smitetraining,d5kpynx,1,t5_2z88k

8521988,0,t3_4v0r4h,I play erlang like an assassin in the jungle so this may not apply directly to you question. I go warrior  qin  ich  then situational afterwards  I feel like at least in the jungle rushing qin makes a lot more difference in the early to mid game with shen he is kinda fake tanky with his ult anyways this lets me delay my defensive items until team fights start to go down.,smitetraining,d66t5uj,1,t5_2z88k
8570584,0,t3_4wzs02,Just some advice if you end up falling behind as a jungler  Do not spend lots of time wandering in the jungle. It will cause you to lose gold and experience that would have been gained by staying near lane.  Dont spend too much time in the insignificant camps namely the back harpies. They do not give experience worthwhile for the time you would take clearing them. Use then if you are really desperate but make it quick to save time.  Stay in lanes a little longer and help clear the wave. However do not stay in that lane exclusively or too long which then would end up defeating the purpose of the jungler role and you would also end up taking away a portion of your teammates farm by clearing wave.  Gank various lanes with a higher frequency as this takes the benefit of farming from point  pushes the enemy a little more but also reduces the negative impact of stealing farm.,smitetraining,d6cwksv,1,t5_2z88k

9034814,0,t3_540ls7,This is likely not the answer youre looking for. I acknowledge that in advance.I think you just had a bad game. Sounds like a trip into Skyrim or Azeroth might alleviate some of the stress. Its better to take a break than to keep playing tilted.For a better analysis it would be helpful for you to go to Smite Guru and link a censored page of the match for people to examine. Items and other stats are quite telling. EDIT Holy crap post karma comment karmaIts like Im telling Santa how to give presents.

Hopefully they do not fall off too hard into the late game and can still help.I am new to the game and get a bit confused between warriors and guardians...A lot of guardians are supposed to be support but how exactly does tanking up support? Arent warriors tanky too? Are mages not supports as well? I noticed mages going in several different lanes. ,smitetraining,d8655cp,1,t5_2z88k

9625345,0,t1_d9ysg1d,The length is to be able to discuss every aspect of the god in extreme depth. Thats why I have annotations at the top of the video so you can skip to the parts you actually want to see.The only way this guide could be considered useless in conquest is because you dont like the build. Thats why I go over multiple options in the build section. But if that build doesnt work for you thats fine there are tons of Ares builds out there to test and try for yourself.As for picking up the pace I actually cut down a lot of the script. Remember that you already know a lot of this stuff. Not everyone does. Some people have never played him before and some dont know anything about him at all. Keep in mind that there are new and inexperienced players out there.For the record the last  minutes of the video is nothing but gameplay footage of a Siege match from near the beginning to end.,smitetraining,d9zit4l,1,t5_2z88k
9718777,0,t1_daaz2vw,No change in the lanes.Theres no real normal build path for adc theres a fair amount of flexibility especially since the most recent patch in which ody bow got a price reduction making it more of an early lane clear item.I dont usually go stacking like trans or devo depends on the adc im playing.So an example would be death toll with boots gt ichaival gt asi  gt wind demon gt deathbringer gt replace deaths toll with executioner at some point. I like the double crit build and ichaival gives you early boxing potential. The crit is nice with dev gloves if you decide to go that way for big boy life steal.You dont need to get qins with crit traditionally youd go one or the other but I really like building both. You can mess around with full pen builds if youre gonna go pen but also want single crit then get rage. People say malice is best but you crit so much more with rage.Theres a fair amount of flexibility Duke sloth is a good youtuber to check out adc builds with barracuda also uploads his ranked games so you can see his builds there.,smitetraining,dab1tit,3,t5_2z88k

11409351,0,t3_62u5q4,Never played League. It depends on if you like ranged versus melee I think. I would suggest ranged gods first until you get the hang of it. My suggestionsHunters Cernnunos Cupid MedusaMages Nox Scylla Thoth If you want mobility you could also try the Assassin Susano or the Warrior Tyr. With Tyr you can use the Shield of Regrowth which gives you a  movement speed after you heal yourself from an ability. Tyrs nd Ability Power Cleave in his Guard blue stance heals you so youll get the buff from the Shield after using Power Cleave in Guard stance. Susano is probably hard for beginners but he is extremely mobile. Also Loki with max cooldown is very mobile because he can go stealth almost nonstop.,smitetraining,dfp8jhx,0,t5_2z88k
