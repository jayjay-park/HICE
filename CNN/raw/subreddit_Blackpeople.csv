4991081,0,t1_cunjeze,You would stand out like a sore thumb. It would be obvious to almost everyone regardless of race that you are not black or part of what is generally accepted as black culture. In fact as soon as most Americans hear your accent youll just be considered a foreigner. Now with that being said there are people in this country who consider anyone with brown skin to be black..........you generally want to avoid these people. They are ignorant. And ignorance combined with ego can be a dangerous combination in this country.,Blackpeople,cunm0bb,3,t5_2r81q
