395817,0,t3_1yhjtz,Mentalloss is probably right. You had an older version of that block in your drawing that youre inserting into and it doesnt know the difference in names. Type purge into the command line and expanded blocks in the window that pops up. Find the block name in the list and click purge at the bottom not purge all. Now try inserting the dynamic.Let us know how it works out!angrycad.WordPress.com,AutoCAD,cflsjec,2,t5_2qtxl

2237474,0,t3_2ks8y7,The best way to trace something in AutoCAD is to use a combination of everything.  Splines plines and arcs.  It is not quite as tedious as what you are doing and there isnt all of this jumping around.  This is how I sometimes trace my base maps from aerials.  One thing that a lot of people dont know is that you can start a pline and start arcing around stuff with out breaking the pline or leaving the command.  This is much more accurate than trying to just trace with a spline.,AutoCAD,clo8j42,4,t5_2qtxl

2711142,0,t3_2r3vek, Dont feel bad nobody really knows CAD until theyve done it for quite a while on a daily basis as with most skills. Also expect to discover new commands  ways to do things  etc. even after decades of experience. Your coworkers will likely be your greatest resource for learning. Listen to them ask questions as often as you can participate in anything and anything that might help you learn a thing or two. A good secondary source of information is trade magazines. There are likely a couple of these that get delivered to your office ask if you can take old copies home and leave them wherever you do reading cough restroom cough. If you find yourself frustrated by something  especially if it happens more than once  make sure you bring it up with a coworker. Ask how they handle the situation when it arises and you just may learn something. Alternatively if you find a good way to deal with such situations ask them if your solution is a good idea. Dont tell them its a good idea it will be received better if youre asking for advice rather than being the newest employee giving orders.,AutoCAD,cnc8v69,7,t5_2qtxl

3385455,0,t1_cpder66,It doesnt matter what kind of craftsman you are  you cant cut steel with a dull drill.  You can resharpen it buy a new drill but you wont make a hole with a dulled or burntup drill.Autocad can get your goals accomplished but there are better.  Autocad is like a crescent wrench in the world of bolts.  It will fit a great many bolt sizes within reason.  But if you need that boltnut torqued a fixed wrench of the proper size will do it so much better and be much less likely to mangle the head.I used Autocad to put out fantastic work for over a decade.  I am much happier to use NX.  I get the job done faster better and with less headaches and with a greater fuller toolbox at my disposal.,AutoCAD,cpe62m0,1,t5_2qtxl

If im trying to snap to the mid point of a line or perpendicular to a line and you have to put the cursor farther away to avoid other lines it would grab the nearest and not any of the other points.

6533825,0,t1_czsxb98,I agree.Keep in mind that theres probably a bunch of different ways to do the same task in AutoCAD. Theres lots of little tricks youll learn along the way that will work or wont for you.When I applied for my first job around  it was because my AutoCAD instructor got a call from a company looking for a CAD drafter. He sent two of us from the class to do an interview. I was the second one to go I walked in and met everyone and the engineer took me to drafting room and showed me the CAD station. It wasnt turned on but he wanted me to draw something. Slightly puzzled I reached to the back of the computer and flipped the big switch of the power supply to turn on the machine. The engineer held out is hand and said congratulations you got the job. Everyone weve interviewed hasnt been able to turn on the computer.I wasnt great at AutoCAD when I got the job but I did my best to learn it and how to use it. They hired a second experienced drafter later on and he helped me learn even more cool tricks.To this day I still use AutoCAD at my current job where I do project management for a company that builds large industrial refrigerated warehouses. Ive done Mechanical drawings Food Processing plant drawings Refrigeration drawings Air Conditioning drawings Electrical Schematic and Equipment Layout drawings for fog systems and now Construction drawings for refrigerated warehouses.Good luck! I hope you find it rewarding and you stick with it.,AutoCAD,czv5eeb,4,t5_2qtxl
