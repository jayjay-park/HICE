1100975,0,t1_cht256v,I suppose I better give out some real advice then...If she is really set on staying in Newcastle AND working as an economist  I would suggest she talks to our corporates in the region.To the best of my knowledge NIB employs economists in blended roles as does PWC.If she is happy to work around her qualification government jobs may provide an easier avenue such as analyst roles  investment accountants  policy officers.Those roles are not always advertised however putting in a CV and a resume as an expression of interest has helped a lot of people.Finally banks have grad programs opening every  months and while these roles will see her cycled through this region rural and city it may give her the exposure to lock down a job with an ecomonics theme.,newcastle,chtfptn,1,t5_2rjoj

3146303,0,t1_coo03rq,I can just see thevars been the next big issue for central Newcastle. All those out of town P platers driving in to the beach. The tram causing a town destroying delay in traffic along hunter street just like the old Whickam crossing hey P.I feel like most people that say central Newcastle is dead never go there on a regular basis they just see  empty windows in businesses and think well west field has a retailer in EVERY space so it sucks here the town is dead lets burn it all and when the property developers have all the  from rebuilding they might throw us a bone they wont see GPT history. A lot of people live there there are a lot of shops and it is actually fairly busy almost every day morose than probably any other suburbs except for inside the major shopping malls.If anything the main revitalization of the town will probably be the uni campus. Combine that with the increase in student numbers living in town and growing hipster scene then might find that town becomes a pretty cool place.

Often but not always so you have to ask first the first consultation is free and  you could get other referrals if a particular lawyer isnt suited to what you need.Depends how much you can spend. I cant really recommend anyone in particular since I dont know specific detains about your situation. But all firms that practice business law can give you information about the different business structures available and then to assist you in either starting your business or referring you to someone that can.Most firms have websites these days.
