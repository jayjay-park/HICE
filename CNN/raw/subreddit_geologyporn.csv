8053339,0,t1_d4kjecu,Most of the time you can only identify what the inclusion is by visual examination. Many of the physical properties of an inclusion are impossible to obtain without breaking apart the crystal to do a hands on examination. You cannot use the regular identification methods such as streak hardness refractive index cleavage etc. However there are several ways to try and identify the inclusions composition. Some basic things to observe are the inclusions color crystal system crystal habit the locality of the specimen and other minerals it is commonly associated with. If you happen to be insanely driven to find out exactly what the inclusion is the crystal will need to be disassembled to obtain a complete identity analysis. Some inclusions may be so small that it is nearly impossible to find out what they are without professional analysis. ,geologyporn,d4l9rr3,1,t5_2t036
