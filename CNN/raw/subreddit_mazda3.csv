Ive got it suctioned to the windshield between the display for the milage and the radioAC.  The neck runs down between the screens and the phone ends up roughly where itd be with the vent mount.  If I positioned it a little better I could probably extend it a little further out from the dash too but resting on the vent prevents a lot of vibration.

Indirect TPMS of article  Tirepressure monitoring system sfw gtIndirect TPMS do not use physical pressure sensors but measure air pressures by monitoring individual wheel rotational speeds and other signals available outside of the tire itself. First generation iTPMS systems are based on the principle that underinflated tires have a slightly smaller diameter and hence higher angular velocity than a correctly inflated one. These differences are measurable through the wheel speed sensors of ABSESC systems. Second generation iTPMS can also detect simultaneous underinflation in up to all four tires using spectrum analysis of individual wheels which can be realized in software using advanced signal processing techniques. The spectrum analysis is based on the principle that certain eigenforms and frequencies of the tirewheel assembly are highly sensitive to the inflation pressure. These oscillations can hence be monitored through advanced signal processing of the wheel speed signals. Current when? iTPMS consist of software modules being integrated into the ABSESC units.gtInteresting BMW FST | QA Technologies | Tire | Omniview technology Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcnkviu oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecnkviu.

2922206,0,t3_2tfwba,To the op your battery needs to be replaced. Period. After dying and being jumped so many times its absolutely in need of replacement. That doesnt mean the source of the issue is your battery  as you said theres likely a draw somewhere or something. You should have a competent dealer or mechanic diagnose it for you . I wouldnt blame Mazda for this its not their fault even if their battery was defective. It sounds like you had a bad dealer which is common to all car makes. In the future if you have a warranteed car you need to . Report issues early and often. Be the squeaky wheel. Document EVERYTHING. Keep ALL paperwork. Make sure everything the service people tell you is in writing. . If you go back twice for the same issue and its unresolved call Mazda corporate. They will register your case and often contact the dealer  if the dealer knows corporate is watching they are more likely to make sure they look at the issue thoroughly. . Mazda wont correct the issue directly but if the dealership you are using is crap ask them to refer your case to another dealer. I know it sucks. Most people buy a car and have no trouble. Ive yet to purchase a new or newused car but have been doing a ton of research and read a lot about people with situations like yours. My advice is based on what Ive read others have done and what has and has not worked. Be professional be organized and dont be a victim. Learn about your car read common forums where users post about their issues and experiences  For instance apparently a lot of Subaru Imprezas  consume oil and it took a lot for people to get the issue corrected. Dealers would say things are fine and totally overfill the oil to mask the issue. Subaru would tell some dealers to replace random parts. Over time enough owners kept track of what was going on and posted their experiences. Most people dont know this issue exists  subarus are just awesome reliable cars right? Or the  Hyundai Sonatas appear to have an issue with how the gas gauge is calibrated  the car will report its low on fuel when there are still  gallons in the tank. People would reach this point go to fill up and started to worry they had a fuel system problem due to how little went in before the pump clicked off. Some have recently had it corrected by dealers but theres no official service bulletin or recall. Heck that same car also has fuel system noise issues when the car is started cold sounds like you placed a playing card into a fan. Again arent Hyundai cars excellent and reliable? There are countless examples just like this that affect thousands of owners. How about the  Cruze owners that have their cars smell like antifreeze or worse when the heat is on? Or how the MTF fluid Chevy uses in the Cruze is junk that should probably be replaced every k miles.... The point is cars are complicated and difficult and theres  lot that can go wrong. Best you can do is take a look online and learn whats common to different models.Sorry for the long wandering post haha. ,mazda3,co09i7k,1,t5_2tlj8

You could get away with just a tune on a stock turbo car speed  but our naturally aspirated engines are pretty limited stock.

I have a manual transmission that hasnt shown any signs of slipping.Mostly just normal maintenance with a few other not too expensive repairs.I do my own oil changes and brake work so I save some money on that end.  Especially when it comes to the brakes.Ive replaced a faulty upper engine mount which wasnt difficult to do on my own as well.Obviously Ive replaced tires as well along with burnt headlights.  As you can see mostly just normal wear and tear.However there are some things where the car is definitely showing its age.  The car itself is just loud now.  Especially on cold days.  The mostly plastic interior rattles like a son of a bitch as well as some of the plastic body parts.  Not as loud in the summer as the heat expands the plastic and it doesnt rattle nearly as bad.My struts are shot.  There is absolutely zero shock absorption.  Thats normal wear and tear but IMO the shock absorption on this car has always been sub par.There is very noticeable rust around the rear wheel wells.  I could get that fixed but at this point I dont really care.  Just saying its there and it didnt happen from hitting anything as its happening on both sides of the rear wheel wells.

7391744,0,t1_d2idrfu,Exhaust can actually increase performance  it reduces backpressure and can thus reduce pumping losses off the engine. Id rather say do an exhaust job vs an intake job  in a fuel injected engine thats computer controlled youre literally making no significant difference in terms of the amount of horsepower for the intake due to the computer compensating for the differences in air flow. On a carbureted engine a trick used by people was to put a slightly bigger jet in to try to get more fuel into the engine  but this has the byproduct of making it run rich  which isnt good for emissions. ,mazda3,d2ie3l0,1,t5_2tlj8

My friend as a social worker has to visit various patients houses and it involves allcity driving which is really frequent on a daily basis. Im saying this so that you dont solely assume what condition the car may have been driven in. It could be city miles which means further inspection is probably for the best.Not sure if its equipped with the old engine or the new at the time SKYACTIV engine but if its the latter youre in good hands. SKYACTIVG engines have proven their superior reliability and still continues to run in  MY cars with the same formula. As ubradn have pointed out well the fueleconomy is one of its biggest selling points. With . compression ratio and clever engineering they were able to get good power output yet amazing fuel economy. Whatever your driving needs are it will do you just fine.As for the maintenance Im not sure as Ive not seen the car or know much more about it. I always recommend to people to go see a reliable independent mechanic who can do a wholecar inspection BEFORE purchase. This way youll roughly know the condition of the car and if any problem is present the mechanic can let you know. Again if its SKYACTIV engine I wouldnt worry much about issues arising from the drivetrain. Just do regular maintenance at proper intervals according to the owners manual and you should see no problem. Good luck!,mazda3,d94ttuc,2,t5_2tlj8

You may need to tighten up the stitches later once it relaxes and gets hot in warmer weather.Applying the leather after soaking it or spraying it until soft with water or rubbing alcohol will allow the leather to stretch more and shrink so you can have a tighter end product. The downside is it will cause dye to seep out and be messy so proper workspace protection is key along with letting the leather drip off before starting. It will also alter the texture of the leather depending on how it was prepared.You can also use an oil but it doesnt work as well depending on various circumstances and then you need to deal with the oil as it seeps out.You can achieve the same results with dry leather but it requires a lot more effort to achieve the same results.,mazda3,de1yhi4,3,t5_2tlj8

I definetely dont need navigation google maps is far superior and faster than mazdas system.Thanks for sharing.,mazda3,de45glr,1,t5_2tlj8
10922072,0,t1_de67kca,I got an ac compressor with clutch from Amazon a few years ago for about . Its still working like a champ. Id say check there.

10943650,0,t1_de8q6g1,Same bottom end different crankshaft. The .L is stroked to mm up from a mm crankshaft in the .L. The benefit for the turbo is you can rev a little quicker into the spool range so response is a little better than if theyd used the .L variant. They also get right up to the limits of the rods with the .L already no sense detuning a good setup to accommodate a slightly weaker bottom end for the same power The force multiplier applied to the crankshaft increases with a mm lever vs mm lever.,mazda3,de8rdmo,1,t5_2tlj8

10957312,0,t3_5whubg,The thump sounds a little concerning. Do any sort of lights come illuminate on the dash? Are we talking an automatic? If so does the car rev and not switch gears?,mazda3,dea632u,2,t5_2tlj8
10995332,0,t1_dee36so,You probably have a loose wire or panel that is vibrating when your AC compressor kicks in providing the noise does have a timing to it.You can try to isolate the location from the outside of the dash by feeling for where it is strongest and then either doing exploratory disassembly or clever tool use to move whatever is vibrating. I would probably try adjusting the wheel and turning the wheel to see if that fixes it before I went taking things apart or poking about. Sometimes pushing or pulling the wheel inout and turning it can get things to reorient and stop it. Sometimes that is temporary so poking about or taking things apart may be the permanent solution.,mazda3,deeabvm,1,t5_2tlj8

Mine was burnt out the blower only worked on speed  the first  settings did nothing. The resistor is there in the air flow because it dissipates a lot of heat. If you let debris build up around the resistor it can fail. It only takes about  minutes to change but costs about  from the dealer.

11592486,0,t3_65ep9c,So my questions areIf I buy a key from ebay how do I determine that it will work with my car? Do I need to match factory part numbers? This key says it works with  Mazda  I Touring Sedan Door .L CC Cu. In. l GAS DOHC Naturally Aspirated but I cant figure out if that applies to my car. There are a lot of price variances. Are these keys the same but  difference? This and thisI need to make sure the FOB I buy has an uncut key battery and transmitter  correct?....yes you are correctIve seen many conflicting posts online about whether or not I can selfprogram the key if I dont have  original keys already. I called a locksmith that claims to be able to program and cut my key for . How would he do this if I dont have  original keys? And if he can do it...can I? Or is it the question of access to some sort of special software?......The smith if he is legit can get your code from either the Door panel inside or somewhere else from your car from there he can program that key too your car he just need your Original Key so you can program the other one. You do not need  just  key to program the other one.NOOOO you cannot program it yourself it is a very VERY specific program you have to have the cut is even specific. If you do decide to get it done from him  is nothing to get one programmed and if it works you have saved yourself around  cause the dealership will charge you more.All you need to do on eBay is look up your cars year and the model. mine was  Mazda  i sport keyfob. Just make sure it is uncut.,mazda3,dga0lsi,1,t5_2tlj8

I like the design the ease of installremoval ability to open and close and the built in extension to make loading a little easier. They seem sturdy and I look forward to actually using them in the next couple weeks.The ski rack was good but the rack spacing made it difficult to out snowboards on with bindings.
