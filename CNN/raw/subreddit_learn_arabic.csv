5858022,0,t3_3vgzm9,Great job uThatBernie! Ive used minimal pair training twice now first for French using Gabriel Wyners deck and then for Turkish using my own deck. This is now my preferred way of starting a language since it is quick to do and getting the phonetics right from the start puts you on a much better path for acquiring a good accent as opposed to muddling through in the beginning and trying to fix the damage later.How did you get the minimal pairs? For Turkish I generated them using a frequency dictionary and search script    which worked without any IPA as written Turkish has an almost  mapping to IPA. However that wouldnt work for most other languages.A few Ankitechnical points You use a lot of sub decks. Its generally not advised to use this many little decks but instead use tags    . In fact I got the you have too many decks warning as soon as I imported the deck. However it wasnt very hard for me to move all the cards into the same deck and delete the superfluous decks. I would argue that it is better to present both sides of the same minimal pair when youre learning a pair otherwise youll just remember that for this pair the answer is always the left one today when reviewing. However its best to not have a predictable order for whether you hear the left one or the right one first so I ordered all the cards together grouped in notes and then switched the order of half the cards based on a random order. Unfortunately Anki doesnt make this very easy. Wyner has a different hack that works better if youre generating the cards from CSV files.,learn_arabic,cxnikc3,3,t5_2v4vi

6062388,0,t1_cydc8o9,Hello. I am a native Arabic speaker but I am interested in knowing how hard its for nonnative speakers to learn my language. since you are here talking about the issue of Fusa vs dialects may I ask you Are the differences between Arabic dialects big enough to make them considered different languages?.  after you learned your first dialect were you able to understand other dialects? I am talking here about the eastern dialects only Levantine Egyptian and Khaliji.  is the difference between two eastern dialects similar to that between Romance languages?.  Did you regret learning Arabic? I think the amount of effort put to learn Arabic is enough to learn both French and Spanish. I am asking these questions because I as a native speaker never realized the big difference between Fusa and dialects and the difference between dialects themselves. I never realized how big the difference is  until I started reading what learners say about Arabic. The only thing that I see truly different is the Moroccan dialect. Thank you.,learn_arabic,cye9tl3,3,t5_2v4vi

7949870,0,t1_d49h6ea,gtIm just trying to explain why there isnt really a difference between slang and dialect in Arabic.  And its because these words dialect a formal variety of a language and slang informal language are you used to distinguish two things that simply dont exist in Arabic.  Arabic simply doesnt have formalized varieties instead they have MSA.  I would take issue with that only in that I would say that while the varieties may not be formalized I would argue they are not of uniform register in other words you could have more formal Lebanese and less formal Lebanese and have MSA as well and thats why I tend to think the dialectaccent split exists to some degree in Arabic as well...in fact it was the Saudi linguist I mentioned that clued me into that. Otherwise though I see where youre going with what youre saying.gtYou used Arabic in your post so I know you understand the Arab worlds diglossic characteristics.  You had just had given a fairly explicitly stated and capable rundown of them and I hadnt been clear about my background knowledge so I thought maybe you werent sure.gtgtArabic so one could get a live sense of how these phenomena are discussed in the language.gtI guess Im not understanding.  If I say bHibb bseyni instead of uHibb qiTTati.  How are you proposing I analyze the Lebanese in terms of which parts are dialect and which parts are slang?Well to tease apart the threads here I mean get a sense of how they are discussed in general as they relate to any language.  For example how would an Arabic linguistics article talk about European vs Canadian French? What terms would they use to say that each dialect has its own accent and its own slang and its own registers etc. and your answer largely provided me with that. The case you present is instructive though.  I suppose I would analyze them in terms of their appearance in various registers of speech and say that if those words and constructions appeared in relatively higher registers then Id consider them part of the matrix language and thus the dialect whereas if they were confined to mostly lower registers and had the  flexibility and ephemerality associated with the term Id be more likely to call them slang I think it was uThatBernie who used the phrase matrix language which I found really handy. In terms of the difficulty or even impossibility of the project though given how diglossia in the MSA using world currently functions I certainly see your point.,learn_arabic,d49n2nj,1,t5_2v4vi
