1011451,0,t3_25eg7o,First off my condolences for moving to one of the top  most expensive states to live in.Second I can only throw in my  cents. As someone who has had ATampT UVerse  years Ive rarely had any problems with them to the point where I had to call their customer service. I can only recall maybe  times or so where my internet was so slow and even after troubleshooting everything I could I just had to call them to see what was going on. That was when I had DSL and everything in general was slow but bearable. It was better than the dialup I had at the time.As someone who hates calling any customer service line for anything I do my best to avoid it at all costs so most internet issues over the years have primarily been fixed by myself. I dont remember having any negative customer experiences with them as I wouldve remembered in the past  years but I wouldnt let that tarnish a company as like I said I dont like calling them ever period and if I ever have to I go into it expecting the worst. I dont know why people regard customer service so highly and if they had one bad experience its the end of the world and that company suddenly is horrible. Im not trying to glorify ATampT Im just saying in the  years that Ive had them living in New Haven county I havent had many issues like the horror stories Ive heard from some other people. Now if you want to talk speed yeah they can do better. I believe their highest last time I checked was mbps down and mbps or so upload? That doesnt even come close to comparing what they have for internet speeds in other countries or if youre lucky enough to live in one of the  cities that have Google Fiber.,Connecticut,chj9cqc,2,t5_2qji0

Definitely check out Wesleyans Center for the Arts for some local theater events.  I know you didnt quite ask for advice but Main St. Middletown is one of my favorite places and it takes a while to explore all of its gems so heres a couple of my favorites The Buttonwood Tree is really great for arts events theyre a nonprofit performing arts and culture center very neat.  Vinnies Jump and Jive is excellent for dancing  they have all kinds of walk in classes like hip hop which I go to! Yay! ballroom swing etc and they host swing and salsa socials on Friday nights.  Esca and Forbidden City are both great restaurants that are more upscale but if you want some cheap great dining Cafe  breakfast The New England Emporium all day Brew Bakers breakfastlunch. If youre looking for a bar look no further than Eli Cannons especially if you like beer if beer is not your thing you would want to go to La Boca or Mezzos.  The other great thing about Middletown is you make yourself out to be an introvert and its wonderful for being alone and people watching. Especially with Wesleyan oh!

1947338,0,t1_cknqq0v,I think its a bit unfair to say its never worth it to buy a used car off a used car lot. I think its a bit more responsible to say cavaet emptor. Not all used car dealers are junk dealers  there is a viable revenue stream in buying decent used vehicles at auction and selling them. And not all buyers can afford to only buy the premium used cars that new dealers or Carmax choose to sell. And while you can comb private listings for a decent used vehicle keep in mind that there is ZERO protection for a buyer in that marketplace.Your last point is the single most important amp often ignored thing to dogtAlso make sure you always hire a mechanic to check before you buy.Make sure YOU pick the mechanic  dont let the dealer sweet talk you into taking the car to his cousin Freddy across the street.Also learn a little bit about cars or speak with someone who is knowledgeable. Theres a reason  year old Audis sell for less than  year old Hondas or Toyotas or Subarus. Theres a reason everyones dumping Saabs. Theres a reason you dont see very many  year old Lincolns or Cadillacs or Mercedes or Mitsubishis on the road. Maintenance costs on some vehicles skyrocket over k miles. On others they remain relatively flat. If youre buying used this needs to be central to your decisionmaking because your mechanic costs can be significantly higher than if you purchase a vehicle with less than k miles.,Connecticut,cknuuts,2,t5_2qji0

1999350,0,t1_cku0o7x,I think you may be misinterpreting the article.  If you build more roads or expand existing ones then more people will use them and theyll be just as congested as before.

By difficult to write I meant like what counts as flextime? what about people that work weekends? what about people that work out if state coughffld county? what happens if your company says yah we have flextime then schedules everyone  every week?All that has to be written and doublechecked for loopholes then there has to be some enforcement mechanisms what about an appeals process etc.  Its all really a lot harder than Joe Q.

2486603,0,t1_cmj3b27,My grandparents came here in a time when America wanted and needed immigrants we no longer do.  They also had nothing to do with taking land from Native Americans who were  eradicated by disease by the time any settlers came to America by the way.  My grandparents as well as myself are recognized by international law as Americans.  Its silly to go around claiming rights to land that was taken  years ago.  People move areas of land change hands.  My ancestors lost power in Scotland hundreds of years ago can I go over there and claim that the government belongs to my clan and only my clan?  Im Icelandic on my mothers side I cant move to Iceland not that Id want to.  Thats the way the world works.  Whats the point of building something great if youre going to let a bunch of strangers leech the fruits of your labor?  Also by that logic neither Dannel Malloy or President Obama have the right to make any laws regarding immigration because theyre not  Native American.  Any law granting amnesty or drivers licenses to illegals is invalid because it wasnt written and voted on by a body of  Native Americans.I label them illegal because they are by definition illegal.  To argue that is to argue with the most basic definition of the world legal.  Its not racist as you purport in other posts they are very very simply illegal.  If I jump the border into any other country I am also there illegally.gtAlso I will never appear anywhere near as stupid or unlikable as you sir any day of the week to any rational minded person.So what youre saying is that anyone who disagrees with you is stupid?  Even I recognize that there are very intelligent liberals.  The fact that your posts are by and large doing worse than mine on a Connecticut subreddit a fairly liberal section of a very liberal site shows that even your peers consider your views and opinions as incredibly extremist and disagreeable.The NSA has a huge file on me for not supporting illegal immigrants?

4174557,0,t3_38kvq0,The current proposition is stupid.  Proposing taxes on a firms out of state earnings may sound good at face value but it simply isnt.  The United States does this with foreign earnings were one of the only developed economies that does it.  How has it been working for the United States?  Corporations keep their foreign earnings in foreign countries instead of repatriating them and issuing a dividend or reinvesting them stateside.  Were one of the only developed nations that does this most other OECD countries with efficient political systems have figured out its a broken model.Its pretty much a slap in the face to firms that are incorporated here.  Say GE has some operations in Georgia.  They pay taxes in Georgia to support the infrastructure that they use.  They should then pay taxes to Connecticut  miles away for what?  For their employees having the privilege to buy alcohol until PM?  Theyre already taxed for their Connecticut operations so they should now pay taxes for things they do that are completely unrelated to Connecticut?This seems pretty cut and dry to me. Democrats want to increase spending acquire more Democrats Despite lying about the lack of a deficit there is a deficit programs must be paid for Malloy sees a honey pot and wants to stick his hands in itConnecticut has been doing the same thing year after year and the results have always been poor.  Not to mention Malloy has defaulted on almost every single election year promise ever to leave his mouth.  You can disagree with my political snips but the first part of this post should be fairly apolitical.The argument that GE are evil tax dodgers and need to have their rates raised is stupid as well.  When we raise rates are the GE accountants going to magically lose their ability to dodge taxes?  Will small businesses still have little to no ability to dodge taxes?

He pulled into a parking lot a few blocks away and so I followed him pulled in behind him and parked and waited as I was  sure the police were coming. I explained what happened to the police and they still gave me a misdemeanor for breach of peace because I did touch his car while I was yelling at him. So now I have to go to court. I am not sure what the police issued to him but I wanted to see if I could find out who this coward is?  Keep in mind he is the one that lashed out at me at a stop light although I was obeying the law and he wasnt.  ,Connecticut,csad2v4,-12,t5_2qji0

We can get lower though through our muchneeded infrastructure building. The US is . trillion behind in roads and bridges construction. Thats many millions of jobs over the course of decades but well need politicians who are pragmatic about taxes and spending.

I never really considered taking care of a disabled family member for ten years as being a marketable skill. So something good can come of that after all.

I can deal with staying in my car  for a while its the winter Im afraid of so Ive got some wiggle room for a while and a few places I can showershave in the meantime but I wanted to get the ball rolling on something thatll actually be more likely to allow me to succeed.  This is me doing something different. I mean Im not lazy. If I were lazy I wouldnt be in the honors society. I actually did volunteer work through Phi Theta Kappa have done things like the walk for hunger ect.  Im seeing a new therapistpsychiatrist who will hopefully be more apt to send in the paperwork to BRS Bureau of Rehabilitative Services whom can also help me in finding work that I can actually do as well.Do I think youre a jerk? A little. Mostly because a lot of people who dont have the same problems that others do dont understand fully how they work. Im easy to jump on the defensive side because Im told more often than not to simply Turn off My issues which isnt really... Possible. If it were that easy there wouldnt be so many people suffering from mental problems like myself. Im just fortunate enough to recognize that its gotten out of control. Ive also put School as my priority. My education has been the forefront of my life for the past few years. Im not letting up on that. Ill figure out the  if I have to march to the Dean of Admissions office myself and tell him how absurd it is that  is keeping an honors student from attending their school is. I kind of wish I had thought to read their web site a bit more readily. I had trusted what the transfer office at my community college had told me.

Candidates would not feel the need to lie as much because theyd know that every other candidate was speaking honestly as well!

This seems like such a rare event it really wouldnt be worth making the bridge jump proof unless we do that to every bridge. Additionally we would have to add barrier on the roadsidewalk divider because people drive way over  on the bridge so you could just into the traffic that has little room to maneuver. I use the footpath to cross to Portland by bike often and for those that have only driven across the bridge the foot path offers really nice views with already very tall railings that you cant go over without doing it purposefully. Adding curved fencing would really ruin the aesthetics of the bridge not to value a view over peoples lives but this isnt really an epidemic.

If they have shortterm disability they will have enrollment guidelines for who qualifies for coverage. Exclusionary periods of up to one year are common. The coverage will typically pay you at  of pay up to  or  days at which point longterm disability will take over. However with pregnancy you are usually only paid until the doctor releases you for work which I believe can be as early as  days after delivery without complications.On the bright side we do have our own FMLA law here which extends job protection to  weeks vs  weeks provided under federal law.

6399626,0,t3_43aht6,CPA here. Actually Scenario  is applicable in EVERY state where there is an income tax and youre a partyear resident  its an apportionment and it is always based on your total income earned. Itd be an exception for them to not do this but Im not aware of any.Scenario  is applicable when you livework in different states with an offsetting tax credit. So theoretically if you were an AZ resident and worked in CT youd pay taxes on the K to both CT and AZ but AZ would give you a tax credit for what was paid to CT. If the tax is lower in the state on that income they reduce the tax credit to the maximum of what the tax is otherwise on that income using that states bracket. If the tax is higher in that state on the same income youll max out the tax credit on that income. As youve lived in AZ for greater than half a year most states then consider you a fullyear resident and tax you as such so that K is included in income there and offset by the tax credit just highlighted.,Connecticut,czh2lm1,3,t5_2qji0

6628461,0,t3_46ejww,I read a very interesting article about the management and logistical supply chain of drug cartels recently. There was a section on the article which describes what Switzerland did to successfully battle their heroin epidemic They legalized heroin sort of. The entire article is very interesting and worth reading but this is the relevant textgt Theres an interesting example underway in Switzerland where theyve legalized heroin which sounds crazy. But its worth making clear that when they legalized it they havent put it on sale in the way that marijuana is on sale in Denver theyve just legalized it by allowing doctors to prescribe it to people who are already addicted and its had quite an interesting effect there because many of the people who are addicted to heroin in Switzerland and indeed in other countries are people who deal the drug because youre addicted to this drug its a very expensive habit and for many people the only way they can afford it is to deal it on the side. So in Switzerland what they found is that by taking those very heavy using addicts into treatment theyve stopped them from dealing the drug because now they get their own drug free of charge from their doctors and because theyre no longer out there on the streets dealing the drug the number of new users has dropped dramatically. So in Switzerland funnily enough since they legalized heroin in this very very limited restricted controlled way the number of new users has actually fallen quite a lot and of course the illegal supply has dried up almost entirely because the supply is now run by the government.,Connecticut,d04xuhd,2,t5_2qji0

7427612,0,t3_4gz94v,Youre going to find a lot of negativity here about Connecticut right now because to be frank things arent going so great in this state. The economy and the state budget are two items of particularly concern with minimal job growth and a billiondollar budget deficit.If however you are deadset on moving here I would avoid the Fairfield County area unless you can find a good job there. It is enormously expensive especially if you plan on living alone and besides the train line getting around that part of the state is very difficult without a car.HartfordWest HartfordNew Britain areas are cheaper and generally seem to have more entrylevel jobs in particular. You can find a decent apartment in a safe area for under  if you look though there are definitely areas of pretty much every city that you want to avoid. In your field you may want to look for work at one of the many state parks and conservation areas. That said as mentioned above the state is in the middle of a budget crunch and is laying people off by the thousands so that could be a difficult job to land at the moment. There are also very few green energyenvironmental jobs in the state certainly not at the level that are available in the MidWest. It is a very small state with a very NIMBY attitude. I love CT but right now it is difficult to recommend moving here because of the many issues the state is facing. When people say it is expensive here they dont just mean rent and gas the food is pricier the beer costs more the state taxes damn near everything it can and yet we still have terrible roads and long waits at the DMV. That said Ive been all over the country and CT is unique in what it offers. In an hour you can be in the mountains or a major city. Its pretty damn safe for the most part and theres plenty to do regardless of your interests. ,Connecticut,d2mgzz3,13,t5_2qji0

8724195,0,t1_d6w26yv,gtIn this case Id have to say that Id choose to remove the minimum pricing rules. Free trade is more important to our economy. If the mom and pop liquor stores want to compete they will need to get more creative such as offering tastings work harder to cater to their customers individual needs and provide a better shopping experience.All the hard work in the world cant outdo bulk buying. When a Total Wine can use their weight to purchase half a warehouse of staple products at a discount its really only a matter of time before they starve out the rest of the market. Curated selection at smaller stores is definitely a positive but when you look at what pays the bills its still the Budweiser and Barefoot that moves quick enough to keep the lights on. When you cant compete in that space youre basically screwed.Now I agree that this is a complicated issue. The only reason that Connecticut has so many package stores is because the minimum bottle pricing allows it. However I would say though that pricewise we arent much worse off than surrounding states especially so with higherend product where known minimum pricing keeps stores that want to rip you off due to scarcity honest as the posted price is public information. Many package stores ride the minimum bottle pricing as much as possible in order to stave off competition from bigger stores. When there are so many players in the space the effect is that the pressure of the collective means that customers can be very cost elastic and any store that tries to jack up prices will immediately lose business. Because of this I think that the perceived benefit of allowing Total Wine and other big movers to change the landscape of the state will not be nearly as beneficial as one would assume. Prices might decline somewhat at first but once there are no other checks on their pricing in the form of minimum bottle pricing and other stores they will be able to charge whatever they want. As it stands liquor in Connecticut is fairly low margin because of the competition if you think that Total Wine would keep it that way when they are the only game in town you are fooling yourself.

8974723,0,t1_d7qkifk,First of all there are  towns in Connecticut not  so the idea that youd have to double taxation across the state is ludicrous.More importantly youre missing my point. The answer is not to shift property taxes from Darien into Bridgeport. The answer is for Darien to stop taking state education dollars and allowing those dollars to funnel into the schools most in need of improvement. Property taxes would only have to go up in Darien to accommodate for the lack of these state funds. And its plausible that shedding compliance with state mandates in many districts would compress budgets enough to compensate.What you need to look at is the ratio of educationspecific state aid to property tax dollars in districts like Darien to determine the worst case scenario for property tax increases.EDIT I wanted to respond to the corruption comment because an underlying assumption of my proposal is that while refusing state dollars will free towns from state mandates taking state dollars will equal greater state control over all aspects of administration.

9769475,0,t1_dagf5rr,Agreed. People arent moving into CT theyre moving out. We could argue statistics all day but people are voting with their feet. Whether or not CT is better or worse than other states based on some objective statistic doesnt really matter. What does matter is what people do and overall more people are finding other alternatives that they see as better options for their situation. As a result the population and tax base is shrinking. Are taxes high in CT? Yes. Is the cost of living very high? Yes. Is that the beallendall of deciding where to live? Absolutely not. The bottom line is that for whatever reason more people are leaving than are coming in. Given that many may be leaving due to the high taxes the shrinking tax base isnt going to improve that and the ones most able to leave are likely to be those that bear most of the tax burden. Regardless of how goodbad things are having less money in the state will not make things better for anyone. ,Connecticut,dahaylq,3,t5_2qji0

What are the plans for those who remain? Are we prepared to shoulder the additional burdens to our social welfare and criminal justice systems? It makes communities less safe and this is what led to the concept of sanctuary cities. Immigrants communities are less likely to cooperate with authorities. And this doesnt just relate to crime. It also means theyre unlikely to pull building permits which can lead to unsafe housing. It means they might avoid registering businesses or obtaining licensing which can result in lost revenue and unsafe working conditions.
