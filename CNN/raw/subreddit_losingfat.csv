Yes you will lose weight if you burn more calories than you eat.  I am by no means disputing that but youre not necessarily optimizing your overall health and shouldnt that be our goal?,losingfat,cvjfhfr,1,t5_38yo8

I do agree that lunch might be a bit carb heavy but its why after making that recipe once I decided to add chicken and split it into three extra servings but still only using one box of pasta. I do have oats I could try doing that instead.... Im just so lazy in the morning but also dont want to wait for oats to boil even though I dont actually have to DO anything haha.  ,losingfat,cylj89s,2,t5_38yo8

Id heard of it but hadnt seen it.There have been so many times Ive been frustrated and thought my efforts were worthless and looking back it was just another week out of many.  Sometimes I was stalled or sabotaging my efforts and other times I was making progress and just couldnt see it.,losingfat,cyqklvk,1,t5_38yo8
