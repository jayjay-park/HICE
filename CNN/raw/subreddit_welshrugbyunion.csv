10957471,0,t1_dea5ygc,For me I think Alun needs a great two games to remain the Wales captain. At the start of the  Nations I felt hed be without doubt the Captain of the Lions his acts on the pitch make me question his abilty to captain at this level as the first pick candidate rather than a one off captain. I was more saying what the general flow of penalties should be in the within  m of goal and p on the pitch go for goal. ,welshrugbyunion,dea6oc6,2,t5_2zqpb
