Higher chance vs stronger enemiesbossesHOWEVER THOUGH.If you awaken any ability from any whispering shard then equip another whispering shard of the same element you can use any awakened abilities from other shards in addition to whatever you need to awaken from the currently equipped shard.For example.Shard A Water teaches Water Wallyou awaken it and equip Shard B Water which teaches Bubble Blaster will now let you use Water Wall as well since youve awakened it!The whispering shards let you use any awakened abilities from other stones just like the contracting stones singing shards.So only  character needs the singing while the other  trade shards after each awakening edit  Forgot to mention that characters do NOT need the singing shard to use the whispering shards.Howeverin battle you do need to use the contract before you can use the whispering shard abilities,LegendOfLegacy3DS,cw10o78,3,t5_39xup

7027914,0,t3_4bvftt,Hi! I know that you seem to have beaten them but let mengive you some advice youll be needing in case you still wan it or someone in the future finds this thread. Spam the ever living hell out of wind contract. Like literally every turn. A it increases your defence and resistances basically mandatory for poison dragon bullshittery and B it will allow whoever is on offense to always their strongest attacks. Keep a strong water contract for healing. Not having a water contract for one turn may mean not being able to heal back to max health. I had one character devoted to healing. Never let him have the water contract he heals to much. Youll be spamming the heck out of wind contract so need to worry about him having that for too long but if you have a fast formation and you steal a contract from him at the start of a turn you may be able to cockblock a turn from him. The fire contract isnt as important as the other  but if you have the chance you can steal it just remember it will weaken your wind contract significantly. Have a good tank and an off tank. You dont necessarily need the strongest shield or block skills but having someone who can reliably soak up damage without dying and someone who can clutch guard if you need your main tank for something specific. Watch out for their carpet bomb attack. It can easily whipe your crew if you arent prepared.hope that helps. The green dragon is by far and large the most difficult followed by the black and finally the red dragon who is a joke compared to his less hidden brothers.As for rewards they have good drops but they arent guarenteed. They can be farmed in the dragon caves found beyond a mirage in the desert. Thats right. They expect you to farm those things. They can also be used for awakening skill. Im pretty sure I awakened the entire god damn water section of spells trying to heal in that fight.,LegendOfLegacy3DS,d1cytz5,2,t5_39xup
