6924,0,t3_1u0f9f,If youre looking for cheap an AR with a high caliber hunting platform isnt the way to go. I actually just recently purchased a Ruger American . bolt action rifle with a synthetic stock. I went to the range last week and sighted it in to get in some late season hunting before the season goes out Saturday. I was very pleased with the rifle because it shot groupings in a smaller hole than this comment Im writing on my phone. So about in groupings. And the rifle is also very light even with a scope mounted. And the price for me was  but that can change depending on where you live and how much of a profit your local gun dealer wants to make. The gun also shot very easily and the trigger is like a dream. But Id make sure to keep the safety on until you shoot because the trigger is indeed very light. Hope this helps. Please go check it out! Oh and Id also suggest any savage rifle. I think there should be a sale on them at any place like gander mountain or maybe a dicks. Happy hunting! ,Hunting,cef83t0,1,t5_2qlkx

82081,0,t1_cenodyj,For the record I dont personally hunt with dogs mostly because my GSD would be a terrible pig dog.Many of us treat them like furry kids and forget that they are just domestic wolves.From the dogs perspective this is probably the greatest thing they get to do. You dont teach a dog how to take down an animal as a pack thats built into them as is the desire to do so. If anything this form of hunting is one of the few times a dog gets to experience actually being whole. The fact that taking down big game with your face is inherently dangerous is precisely why wolves  dogs have evolved into the form they have EDIT pugs excluded that ones totally our fault and have the personalities they do. Its why we get along so well because we live and hunt in a similar cooperative manner.At the risk of treading into a naturalistic fallacy of all the dogs kept by people these may be among the ones living most true to their nature.,Hunting,cenrv0i,4,t5_2qlkx

Saturday morning no gobbles people EVERYWHERE. Literally had a hard time finding a pull off that wasnt occupied. Birds are off to a very slow start in most areas of the state and a lot of people are struggling to hear much gobbling.Got lucky around  and spotted a gobbler and hen from the road. To make a long story short...Took  set ups and  hours to close the deal. Ended up being  hens and  longbeards in the flock. Hens left them around . Called the duo in twice but both times they hung up at  yards due to woods being wide open. On the fifth set up I finally got in front of them in some thicker woods and positioned myself in their path. I could tell the direction they were heading from their scratching. Popped one at  yards at PM. . hours to close the deal! Only four gobbles from the duo. Once at my yelps and again when I gobbled at them.Not your textbook gobble all the way to gun hunt but Ill gladly take matters into my own hands and use my woodsmanship to close the deal when birds arent very cooperative.

971405,0,t3_257crf,My adrenaline rush while hunting was this last season. I went out to the ranch by myself. I had my AR on me with one  rd clip. I decided to walk through the field and check on my feeder. Once at my feeder I heard grunting sounds off in the woods to my right. I locked and loaded my AR and turned the corner from some brush and hit the pig jackpot! There was fifteen or twenty feral pigs feeding off acorns over a large plot. My heart starts racing. I sneak behind a large oak tree scope out a decent pig and squeeze the trigger. The pig move and instead of a neck shot I gutt check him. The pig goes down but is squealing. Then it happens. All the other pigs start taking off in all directions. Now I am behind a large oak tree so they do not see me. I had one pig run right past me. I start shooting at him but he is too quick and I can see my bullets hitting the ground behind him. I whip around and a large sow runs past me. I try to take a shot but she gets lost in the brush. I come around to focus on my pig and take a few more crack shots at pigs running off but to no avail. My pig is still squealing. I take a final shot to his head and it was over. My heart is racing. I do an ammo check and I only have three in the clip and one chambered. Fuck. I slowly walk the fifty yards where my pigs lays and I could hear the other pigs grunting in the brush. I make sure my pig is dead and hi tail it to my truck to get more ammo. I stock up and return to see only my pig there. It was a rush! Got some nice meat out of it!TLDR. Went hunting saw tons of pigs killed one and shot at three of them two charging my way then almost ran out of ammo in the field with pigs grunting at me in the brush.,Hunting,chepi73,1,t5_2qlkx

1193797,0,t3_27rnvz,I just want to make the point that there can be a significant difference between a canned hunt and a fenced hunt.Personally I feel that an  acre pen is really too small to be considered fair chase.Its  square km and hunting animals confined to such a small area basically amounts to walk out and shoot it in various forms.However larger fenced hunts are another matter entirelyIn places like Africa where fenced hunting can be the norm the fenced area can be tens of thousands of acres.  That type of fenced hunting I can consider fair chase.  For all of the outcry about African highfence hunting few are stopping to consider that most of the prominent safari companies are hunting on well over   acres of land with plenty over   acres the biggest Ive found so far was in Nambia with over   acres of fenced land.I really wish that legislation would be introduced that restricted fenced hunts to something like no less than  acres.  I still dont know whether Id consider that sufficient but it would put the cattle pen deer farmers out of business and be a step in the right direction.I also think that scoring associations should unanimously ban further trophies and disbar existing ones taken under lessthansporting fenced conditions.  Its a travesty that SCI recognizes farmed trophies  I dont care that theyre in the separate estate class or not.,Hunting,ci3x5uu,6,t5_2qlkx

1357461,0,t1_cim9yc9,gtif youre not eating it i dont know what the point of killing it is.For conservation.  These animals are chosen specifically to be put down for the benefit of the rest of the population.  Usually an aggressive male past breeding age that is killing off other breeding males that are needed to keep the population alive.  You could just have a park ranger or somebody put the animal down.  But if you can get someone to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to conservation efforts to hunt it instead... Well thats two birds with one stone.Also there are lots of perfectly sound reasons to kill other than nourishment.  Im a horticulturalist and my parents farm and raise animals.  We have to deal with foxes rabbits weasels pigs mice mountain lions squirrels birds deer and bugs.  Do we eat the foxes and mice we kill?  No.  Do we have time to hunt all these animals?  No.  We let people hunt on our property.  Why do they do it?  For sport.Lots species other than humans including non predators kill other species for reason other than nourishment.  Lions will kill rivals.  Baboons will kill a panther cub.  Termites will go to war with ants.  Dogs will kill cats.  Cows will swat flies.  Wolves would snatch European children.  A bear killed the grizzly man.  Death and killing is a part of nature and serves a purpose. That fact that we experience joy from doing things is a concequence of us being human.  We experience joy when we participate in sport just like we experience love when we participate in marriage.  Saying that hunting should not be done for sport but only for nourishment is like saying marriage should not be done for love but only for reproduction.  So what if I get a kick out of hunting?  So what if I like fucking my wife?  I dont feel guilty or experience shame when I take an animals life and it is perfectly human and in tune with nature to do so just like I never feel guilty or experience shame after having sex as it is perfectly human and in tune with nature to do that.  ,Hunting,cimg523,6,t5_2qlkx

A montana unlimited guide might be possible but I dont know if anyone does those units anymore.  Hogs you can DIY pretty easily.  Just an FYI.  Also guided hunts do not mean success.  It just means they know the land and youve got to hold up your end.  Ive taken guys out before fishing that were in terrible shape and hence didnt catch anything.  Imagine doing a hunt that way at over ft.  Ok.  Im generalizing a lot here.  You have to draw tags for most of the species you mentioned.  You decide the unit you want to hunt and find an outfitter after you draw the tag.  Drawing tags is a process all on its own.  There are also guided hunts where you are guaranteed a tag because the outfitter has one.  Some states you can only hunt some species as a nonresident with a guide.  Or you can only hunt certain areas with a guide.  For websites just start googling and looking at the outfitters.  ,Hunting,cjoqeks,2,t5_2qlkx

I personally swap it up but am really partial to my over under. My pops likes his g double barrel and will even use for duck hunting but knows his range is more limited. Play with your decoys and see what works. One of the places I like to go has two ponds one is further out. Ill put the decoys in the further pond. More often the ducks will see the empty pond closer to us and land there. Not sure why but found it works at the one blind. to be honest Ive done just as well with  to  bag of decoys. It baffles me why people think they need  bags full. But mix up the decoys. A couple of one kind a couple of another a couple feeders and a spinner just in case there is some wind. Really play with the calls though!! You will find that you can call birds in with only a couple decoys and personally I prefer not carrying extra weight. ,Hunting,cldl8q8,1,t5_2qlkx

I scored him by rounding up or down to the nearest half inch and he came out to  after deductions.Took him with a ga from about  yards. Something spooked him out of the heavy brush on the left side of the second picture and he came trotting up. I bleated at him but he kept trotting so I shot him on the move quartering toward me.

The idea is you can have your own spot with a cabin pond etc... but not have to spend a fortune while having walking access to thousands of acres of hunting property.

2637076,0,t3_2q47nl,What you need to do is get a raw wet coon hide and let your dog play with it. Maybe even get some meat and give it some nibbles. When your dog is getting aggressive take the hide away from it. Lock your dog in a closet or a room somewhere where it wont be able to see you and drag the hide around in your yard or down the street and leave it at the end of its scent path. Bring your dog out to the scent trail and let it work. Hounds arent known for their intelegence but they do love to work and can be one of the best working breeds if trained properly. You may need to start the dog on the trail or even drag the hide behind you on a bike while your dog follows but it will learn.Hope this helped.,Hunting,cn2srnu,3,t5_2qlkx

2694578,0,t1_cn9wypk,Aging the meat allows the muscles to become more tender which results in easier processing and better tasting meat in my opinion.  I usually skin my deer the night of and I am I Ohio where hunting season is typically  below  degrees. I will let it hang for up to four days if the temperature stays right as you do not want your meat to freeze completely. Skin off throughout this process and then quarter it. I will then leave the quarters in the fridge for a day or so then begin the processing.  It is common to age meat...not everyone does but just what I do. I have been fortunate to learn all this from a family of butchers for the last ten years I do exactly what they do.  If it is an early season  kill quarter it the night of and let the aging go on in the fridge. Just make sure to air out the fridge periodically. As for hanging the deer hanging unit itself you were on the right path for attaching and eyehook or standard hook to your garage rafter. Good luck man.,Hunting,cnaatdw,2,t5_2qlkx

There is a course to get your hunting license and then you must mail away for you actual license and that can take a long time. You also need to take the firearms course to get your firearms license to be able to own your guns in Canada once the course is completed and you mail in it can take up to  months to get your license I know fuck the Canadian government.

Montana and Idaho would be the easiest in that regard because they are over the counter. Colorado and Utah you would have to draw the deer tag. Utah does not have deer hunting concurrent will elk huntingExcept Archery.Nevada has different seasons but drawing an elk tag is really difficult. Arizona has a bunch of different seasons but drawing an elk tag is really difficult. Wyoming you would have to draw it as a non resident the deer and elk tags but cow calf tags some are full price  and some are reduced price . Im not sure about New Mexico Oregon and Washington.Outfitters hunting priority Most not all TV Shows Full GuidedBig Drop Off Semi Guided Drop CampsAn airstrip into the Idaho Wilderness would be my recommendation if you are looking for a backcountry adventure.

4408038,0,t3_3bih1j,What are you going to hunt?I assume you will be looking at birds. The question you have to ask next is it an upland or waterfowl dog?Waterfowl Dogs  Labs are the most common and some are better hunters than others. Chesapeakes will meet you size requirement but they are not for someone who has not trained dogs before. They will walk all over you if you let them. Newfies are a big dog and will retrieve ducks but do not have the hunting desire of other waterfowl dogs.Uplands Dogs  Setters will be your best bet with size up to lbs but they require some coat maintenance. The rest of the upland dogs will be smaller. Some like the Weims and Vizslas can get up to lbs. Upland dogs bodies take a beating on the terrain especially out west so a lighter dog is more suited to the terrain.Versatile Dogs Dogs that do both  Are hunting machines but once again will not meet your size requirements.  A few Questions to ask.What will I be hunting primarly?How much time am I going to commit to training the dog?If I cant commit enough time to training do I have the money to get it trained professionally?Am I willing to commit at least  hours a day to running the dog?  A common problem with hunting dogs is that they are under exercised and under mentally stimulated. These will lead to a lot of health and psychological problems.How much time will I actually spend hunting with the dog?  If you like to hunt a lot of big game then your dog cant go with you in most states.  If you only bird hunt  times a year it probably isnt worth it to get a dog IMO. To End  Each breed of dog will have pros and cons you can look at the breeds via google and figure out which one fits your needs and go with that breed. A bird dog is a huge commitment more so than any other type of dog other than Hunting Hounds. If you can commit to the dog and use the dog as it is bred you will have the best hunting friend a man could have. If you cant just get a German Shepherd and have a good family dog. ,Hunting,csmir4j,6,t5_2qlkx

4609307,0,t3_3e4pn2,A tip Ive heard a lot is to vary the pace of your steps  i.e. dont walk at a constant rate but take a few quick steps stop a few slow ones etc. The idea is to sound more like another critter  wild animals dont walk at the same rate all the time like humans do so it makes you sound like you belong in the woods a bit more. Now I cant provide any evidence that it actually works but I always thought it was a neat idea.Also when you stop to look around dont just look around at eyelevel. Bend down lean to the side etc to see through the trees at different angles.

4858349,0,t3_3heuqg,I am not certain what point the author is trying to make here. Of course no one should ever take a shot that is outside the capabilities of their equipment or themselves. What if my window of capabilities happens to extend to  yards?  I know shooters who can make a more humane kill at  yards than the average deer hunter can at . To quote the author At  to  yards you know as well as I do that anything can happen to that bullet en route to the target and the game animal will pay the price for a less than wellthoughtout move on the hunters part. I have no idea that he means by this statement. Does he believe that his bullet with just mystically deviate from his intended target or does he just not have a firm grasp of ballistics? He apparently thinks that long range hunting is not very sporting which is an argument I have heard before. True a game animal at  yards has no idea that the hunter is in the area but isnt that the point of hunting? The purpose of camouflage and cover scents and field craft is to keep the animal from knowing that you are in the area. What difference does it make if the deer doesnt know I am  yards away or doesnt know I am  yards away? It doesnt violate fair chase in my book. Is it easier to maintain stealth at half a mile? Sure. I do argue though that the shooters making ethical and I stress ethical shots at that distance are not making them because they lack skill for stalking. They are choosing to set up those shots because they enjoy the shooting aspect of it. Perhaps the author wishes that we all go back to muskets or is that too long range and we should use spears?,Hunting,cu6xj64,4,t5_2qlkx

My first rifle had a bad firing pin which I exchanged at cabelas thankfully they worked with me since my season starts in a little over a week.

A rifle would limit what you can hunt where the shotgun can cover everything you said. Take a hunters safety course and do some targetclay pigeon shooting to familiarize yourself with the gun.

Certain years you wont be able to shoot certain ducks and you have to make sure that of those ducks flying in none are illegal. people in a duck blind can lay down a flock of mallards pretty easily.  How is that different from a big deer drive with a lot of standers?gt It requires almost no skillMost modern hunting doesnt require much skill.

When you are confident you can hold the butter temp without it dropping below  or going over  add your tenderloin it should be completely covered in the butter. This is a fat bath the very lean venison will absorb some of the fat form the butter and draw flavor from the seasoning into the meat. TEMPERATURE CONTROL IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE.As the meat passes  degrees start heating up a cast iron skillet as hot as you can make it get. Do not add oil to this pan. When the meat reaches  degrees remove it form the fat bath and roll it across the cast iron skillet very slowly. It should take about two minutes for you to completely roll it across the skillet and get a nice seer.Let it rest for about  minutes before slicing and serving.

Deer are creatures of habit and will eventually start going to the feeder every morningevening when they figure out that it is a reliable source of food. You just have to figure out their patterns and if you arent seeing them with your eyes see them with a camera. Make sure you have good scent control. Wash your clothes and body the night before with scent killer and dont let any smells get on them before youre in the field. Deer trust their sense of smell and sight above all else.

6070322,0,t3_3yjxea,In unusually warm winters deer will change their behavior.On our property in VirginiaNC they actually avoid the late season grains like beans and corn rather they prefer clover peas and grasses. So this fallwinter I sat in some of the early season stands that were over those fields.The deer outside the rut will also simply not move as much. First they arent cold and expending tons of energy trying to stay warm so the amount of caloric intake is lower. Second they have their winter coats on so moving around makes them hotter. Lastly they just dont have that sense of urgency to feed that cold weather brings in my opinion. We use trail cameras all over our properties and naturally see the movement restricted to nights. Unfortunately warm weather means poor deer hunting conditions. This past fall there were  mature . bucks harvested off our properties and we predicted pretty much every night someone got one  they were the cold daysnights. My tips hunting hardwoods  hunt trails leading tofrom the north side of hillsmountains will they will be in shade predominately hunt on windy days  i find deer move most when there is a good solid breeze mph. obviously hunt with the wind in your favor on these days.hunt waterbedding  on hotter days if possible hunt over a watering hole or bedding area. usually these are harder places to set up on but could be rewarding on hot days when you dont expect to see much movement,Hunting,cyfb3aq,1,t5_2qlkx

All  acres of it that is currently open to the public is going to private ownership. Link here   I think you have family in AK. Alaska sells their state land to fund the University System the Mental Health System and part of the Eduction System. Alaska has perfected the art of selling land as much as anyone. Here is where you can buy some Alaska land right now   And if they want to buy some Utah land Utah is doing a true Land Office business in disposing of their public lands. If your family members can get registered they can get in on the May auction at this link   Utah sold almost  acres down by Zion ? last fall and I guess it had some great deer hunting. Probably still great deer hunting but rather now it is private deer hunting. That link shows the many auctions Utah has to dispose of this nuisance hunting land. You can tell them to email me if they want more examples. Those links took about four or five minutes. Nevada is mad because they sold  acres of their state land to the political cronies and now they are out of inventory.

They were both acting a bit spooked at first but came out after the hens had been there for a  minutes. They finally moved in and he made his way within shooting distance and thats it.

Otherwise groups businesses and other orgs all engage in PR to differing ends. Its not like marketing firms are plotting to deceive everyone at every turn so that they profit more. They just get hired to further individual agendas of different organizations with different aims. And an inversion of reality? You really need to settle down the wordflourishing.

We take them out and show them a few spots and how to look for sign then they choose where they want to sit and we leave them with a radio and tell us to call when they are ready to come in or got a kill and we will come back. Theres absolutely no guarantee theyll kill or even see anything because we dont bait deer.Thats real hunting. Not the fake high fence stuff. And you can say to each their own but killing animals on a high fence ranch is NOT hunting theres no opinion about it I mean it doesnt meet the general definition or principle of hunting.

9413270,0,t3_59kgqc,Quality article. Wild species genetics are a function of nature. There are too many variables that contribute for individuals to make a difference. Having innumerable variables is important and its what breeds healthy hearty populations. Habitat destruction is and will far and away be the most influential factor in species health. Protecting and creating habitat and ensuring travel corridors for big game does more for population health than every other management tool combined by a long shot.Breeding captive deer does nothing but create inferior stock. Sure you can end up with with giant antlers and big bodies. The lack of diversity however leads to generic degradation. Theres no interbreeding between separate populations and inbreeding orders of magnitude higher than the wild. Theres no exposure to predators and disease. Selective breeding leads to many unintended consequences. When you breed for a specific trait especially one thats recessive there is a good chance that other often detrimental genes are carried on. How many breeds of dogs are prone to specific health problems?Domestic dogs cattle chickens these animals dont have wild counterparts. Whitetail deer do and when caged deer escape all the time they pollute the wild gene pool.Escaped farmed salmon and even stocked salmon have wreaked havoc on wild populations creating fish incapable of living and reproducing like they should. At least fish farming serves a purpose creating lots of food. No one who goes to a high fence operation is just going to feed their family. They exist for trophy hunters and folks who dont know how to hunt to shoot an animal and brag about to their drinking buddies.If there is land and habitat there are and will always be EXACTLY as many trophy bucks as there are supposed to be. If you want to kill one you need to be good lucky or both. Growing wall hangers is nothing more than creating hollow trophies for small people. ,Hunting,d9974ps,7,t5_2qlkx

9718507,0,t1_da9kchn,Im not sure what some of these folks are talking about waterfowl can get pretty expensive.  Forget all the fancy camo just go out in earth tones.  Its also nice because you can disregard optics.  That said youll need some sort of blind material decoys and a call call will be  for a beginner one.  Dont use the call early on but practice a lot.  For decoys Id say you should start with .  For blind material go to Wal Mart and buy their blind material you can build a goodenough blind for .  Then buy a bunch of PVC pipe and just zip tie the blind material onto the PVC.  Also I just found a mother load of decoys on Ebay.  Got  ducks and  geese for .  Pretty pumped.  Check out craigslist too.  Goose decoys are expensive but you can find good deals on ducks.  You also need to figure out retrieval.  My suggestion would be use a fishing pole.  That said if youre shooting over a large lake and lets say your range is  yards you need to reduce your shooting range to how far you an cast.  Rig up a system with a heavy weight and heavy line and a treble hook.  To give yourself more range youll want waders you probably want waders no matter what as theyll help in setting up the decoys and all that.  If you want to do cheap waters craigslista shit load of aquasealer.  New waders will run you  for a pair of entry level Reddingtons.  I just use trout fishing waders because I get too damn hot in the neoprene ones.  Your other option is to jump shoot water fowl.  Fun but sort of tricky and if youre not floating a river you really just get one crack at it.  Regardless I agree with the general sentiment that the gear is sort of over done.  Totally disagree that waterfowl is the cheapest way to hunt.  The cheapest way is buy a . or  gauge and have at it with small game.  . hunting squirrels is the best way to start IMO.  That said I started by stomping around ag fields with out a dog hunting pheasant and quail.  Learned a lot and didnt need anything but a shotgun and ammo.  Edit Youll also need something to sit on for waterfowl hunting.  I usually just sit on my cooler and throw a sweatshirt on top of it.  Gives me a place to throw my ducks when Im done and gives me a nice seat.,Hunting,dab0mbc,3,t5_2qlkx

9854282,0,t3_5gf32z,A lot of bear chargesattacks happen when man and bear unexpectedly find each other in close proximity and by then theres very little time to draw fire a weapon and make a lethal shot on a bear. They may not appear fast but bears can move super fast in short bursts. There have been accounts of bears covering  feet a stride in charges. Many attack victims report that from the time they saw the bear to the time he was on them was nanosecends. Head on a bear is built like a tank. Bear social hierachy is brutal and violent. A bears head and shoulders are designed to deflect blows from other bears. Head on like in a charge the angle of the bears skull and shoulder bones can literally deflect bullets. ,Hunting,das1ak7,4,t5_2qlkx

10017867,0,t3_5j2thc,That one might be ok but if o were you I would buy something in person that way you can make sure it feels good on you. If youre doing a lot of walking the comfort of your pack can make or break your hunt a poorly paddedset up pack will lead to soreness fatigue and even possibly injuries. I use a pack that is not hunting specific because it is designed to be worn for long hikes. Many hunting specific bags are gimmicky more expensive and uncomfortable as hell. My osprey brand pack holds  liters of water plus all my gear all while being super comfy and not weighing me down. A note on the coffee youll regret filling the hydration bladder with coffee. It will get cold fast especially the few sips that are continually getting stuck in the tube make your bladder permanently smell of coffee and most importantly drinking  liter of coffee on your hunt isnt the best backcountry decision. You may get dehydrated and over caffeinated leading to more discomfort and fatigue. My recommendation find an osprey pack or something similar that is an earthy color and holds all of your gear plus room for another layer. Fill the bladder with plain ol water and get yourself a small thermos for coffee. That way you will always have fresh hot coffee you can stay hydrated and you can carry your gear comfortably. ,Hunting,dbdcudq,3,t5_2qlkx

Check out this article for a good step by step description on how to do it the right way Typically you dont need to pay extra for the rifle just what youd pay for a regular checked bag.Prices for taxidermy really vary. So does quality. My personal recommendation is to get your trophies dipped and packed then shipped to a good quality taxidermist in the USA like the Wildlife Gallery for finishing. All things considered this will be slightly more expensive by a couple hundred dollars than doing it over there but you will probably get much better bang for your buck this way. You can get Taxidermy prices from the Wildlife Gallery web site. Get in touch with the outfitter youll be hunting with and ask who their dip amp pack and shipping agents are. Then request a dip amp pack price list and a shipping estimate for the animals youll be hunting. South African Airways and Delta Airlines are the two best choices for getting to South Africa from the USA. Delta has direct flights from Atlanta and SAA has direct flights from Washington Dulles and JFK. I do NOT recommend flying through the UK or Amsterdam if youre bringing your own rifle. ,Hunting,dezfk8w,3,t5_2qlkx

11395205,0,t3_62kqth,My advice if you have never used a bow is this  dont start with a heavy draw weight. Most people havent really developed the muscles in their back used to draw a bow and they end up using their biceps to start the draw. This can easily lead to a rotatory cuff injury. I can tell you from experience this type of injury can be slow to heal. When you are drawing the bow your back specifically the rhomboid muscles should be doing the work. Most bows have a draw weight adjustment so if you buy a compound bow that is  lbs but adjustable to  lbs that would be pretty good. You wont need much for killing turkey and that would also be enough to kill deer.If you go with a recurve bow then you should start in the  lb  lb range and work up in  lb intervals to the hunting draw weight you plan to use. In either case you dont really have time to become proficient before the season starts. Id go with the shotgun and get the bow later in this case.,Hunting,dfnmq20,1,t5_2qlkx

Both of my main rifles are benjamin pumpers.  I have killed more grackles with my . pumper pistol than I have with my . rifle as well.  Anecdotal evidence here just sharing what I know.  I have taken a couple of rabbits with both rifles no problem with a head shot.I find that pumpers are far more accurate for me than break barrels and shot placement is more important than FPS within a window anyway so keep that in mind.,Hunting,dftudx3,1,t5_2qlkx

11540169,0,t3_64pmg4,Thats the way it goes sometimes bud. Thats why its called hunting and not killing. If you arent having luck though the best piece of advice I can give is change something. Move your stand location. Try using different calls. Maybe youre calling to much? Not enough? There is no magic voodoo dance for success. All you can do is prepare and if youre not having luck you need to change something. Learn some patience too. Not everyone kills something every year and if someone is being impatient they tend to rush through stuff and expect good results,Hunting,dg42w7h,2,t5_2qlkx
11548703,0,t1_dg46qzq,gt We r swimming in birds here in PAI worked on a hunting preserve for about  years.  I was out on  acres in the heart of farm country in SE PA every single day of the year.  We might have seen turkeys twice a year.  Turkeys have made a comeback but I wouldnt say were swimming in them.But aside from turkeys grouse and pheasants also nest on the ground.  Theres probably more groundnesting birds than you think.  I find it hard to believe that possums can put any sort of a noticeable dent in tick numbers.  Id have to do some research on that.  They eat almost anything they come across.gtI would rather trap a bunch of skunks.  Nice furWell you cant really pick and choose there.  Theyre both nuisance animals and any trap that will catch a skunk will also catch a possum.  And both furs are basically junk in the market right now.  Shit even a good PA fox fur this year was only bringing about .  So you can imagine how worthless those other furs are.

11619076,0,t1_dgd0grt,Tuning your arrows sounds extremely complicated when explained but its not that bad. Basically it has to do with your arrow weight spine fletchings etc. Also starting with a good arrow is incredibly important. I could write a few paragraphs about it but instead Ill just point you to the nock on podcast and YouTube videos. John Dudley does several videos about arrow building and shooting formbasics etc. it is incredibly informative and for me has tightened up my groups from paper plate at yrds to baseball sized groups. Edit forgot to answer your question about target. Most new compressed foam targets something like the block brand will work with broadheads. Also Ive said this many times but practice does not make perfect perfect practice makes perfect. Meaning if I go out to my yard and shoot a dozen arrows but dont make sure my form and everything is perfect thats going to translate into probably worse form and everything else when Im amped up drawing on an animal. ,Hunting,dgd176h,2,t5_2qlkx

Basically find the seasonal food source find fresh sign hunt them like white tail. So yeah lots of scouting and then sloooowwwwww creeping around the woods once I find fresh sign.
