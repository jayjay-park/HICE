11554711,0,t1_dg5pv03,Yes I can almost nail that song. Im getting better every day  my goal is to be able to play the verse for Love the intro to The Axe and the fast parts of Flying Whales.,GojiraMusic,dg5qavm,2,t5_3jak8
11654702,0,t3_66axjs,Dawn is one of their best songs imo. Even though its quite long and consists of only three different riffs it still sounds like it lacks nothing. Layered guitar melodies build up earthly atmosphere the transition to roaring th note riff is so tasty and outro rolls all the way to the horizon.,GojiraMusic,dgh2pk5,6,t5_3jak8
