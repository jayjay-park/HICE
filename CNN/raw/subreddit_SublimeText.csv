7526788,0,t3_4idl1f,It might help to search github for the packages you use. You will find readme files for the packages you installed. That might be what you need most as they tell you mostly what to put in the user preferences files and sometimes link to a webpage with more details. Check those out. If thats not helpful enough search github for the sublime preferences file and see some example settings. And many times you can find a tutorial on setting up sublime packages. When youre starting out its really helpful. I think maybe nettuts has a decent couple.It also might be a good idea to pick one linter at a time. Not only will you have time to acclimate to each one you can see if it works for you and will notice if there are conflicts when you add another. Also dont know if you have ST or ST but not all packages work on both versions so keep that in mind too.,SublimeText,d2xrbjl,3,t5_2syyf

7960739,0,t3_4o9nt2,What are you trying to open the file with? I dont recall that SublimeText can do this natively. It could be the case that your editor has removed the BOM as it is uninteresting for the content. Try this with another editor or simply read the file as a stream. The BOM should be there.,SublimeText,d4av1w4,2,t5_2syyf
