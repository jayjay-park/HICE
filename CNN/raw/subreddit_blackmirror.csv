The part when RoboAsh tells Mar over the phone about an experimental next level of their software but its expensive really makes me feel a bit ill. Mar had no choice. She was obsessed with speaking to him at that point and the software knew it. I suppose it helps that Im involved in a  year relationship as well but I could really relate to Mar.The final ten minutes of the episode are so heartbreaking and so disturbing as Mar realizes that what she has is not Ash but a rather poor copy of the things hes said online. Still she cant bring herself to destroy him and totally lose her connection to him a second time so she relegates him to an existence trapped in the same attic that his mother once stored photos of his deceased brother and father after they died.Its a  episode for me.

9365140,0,t3_58kp8d,It reminded me of Mulholland Drive the protagonists reality was in fact much darker than her dreamlike facade. We see all these idyllic and heavily curated images but theyre ultimately empty representations. Theres very little authenticity left no meaningful interactions with other people content curation stems almost entirely from a desire to be liked. Upvoting seems to have replaced capital as a form of currency. It can plausibly correlate to many things in our society social statuspopularity credit scoreincome Yelp!Uber OKCupidTinder etc.The thing that maybe resonated most with me was the idea of using your oldest friend whos only a . as your maid of honor in order to seem more authentic  an extremely cynical gambit calculated by focus groups to maximize five star ratings. It seems as comparably patronizing and disingenuous as parading your only black friend around to impress your white friends. And as others in the comments have mentioned boosting or artificially inflating social capital with fake followers is a very real thing.I also really appreciated Lacies interaction with the woman with the star rating who told the story of her social decline she was probably the most authentic person we saw. Being real has social consequences but its liberating.Sometimes you may find yourself feeling slighted if somebody fails to reciprocate a like on Instagram Twitter or Facebook.

9371261,0,t1_d93uliu,I disagree. Its true that Brooker has tackled VR in a few different episodes but each one addresses a different philosophical question. SPOILERS White Christmas Playtest and San Junipero spoilers ahead. White Christmas deals with whether or not a downloaded consciousness is really human and whether or not we need to treat them with some level of humanity as well as its applications in things like interrogations techniques and whether or not evidence collected from such a being is ethical reliable or admissible. Playtest deals with doubting reality and exploring what happens when we really dig in to what disturbs us the most. It starts off with superficial fears like spiders and monsters and gradually the fears become more fundamentally. Eventually the episode addresses the main characters fear of his interpretation of reality and whether it can be trusted which plays right back into the inherent doubt one might have when experiencing layers added onto reality. But San Junipero deals with the afterlife and whether or not choosing to pass on to San Junipero is the right decision. It made me wonder about the concept of heaven about how long I could stand a life free of responsibility in SJ about whether or not it would really be me in SJ. It made me wonder if staying in SJ would mean leaving my dead friends and familty behind if they werent there. I dont believe in a soul but it made me wonder about whether uploading my consciousness into SJ would mean my soul didnt get to move on. So while it is true that VR and AI are topics that Brooker loves to cover he always leaves me asking different questions and coming to different conclusions. ,blackmirror,d93vgr6,20,t5_2v08h

This is sometimes done to combat severe epileptic seizures. What sometimes happens in these patients is that you get two distinct personalities who are in conflict with one another and cannot communicate with each other directly. If you ask one of them what he wants to be he says one job. Ask the other via visual means shown only to one eye what he wants to be and he conveys something else. Sometimes one half believes in god while the other does not. If souls exist does this mean that this person does not get to go to heaven? Or does he now have two separate souls? ,blackmirror,d941oxi,3,t5_2v08h

Officially thats just to look at buyingselling feedback to see if the individual is responsible  so basically like AmazoneBay ratings. But since its integrated with AliBaba and examines purchase history it can see what youve been buying. So for example a book called Bloody Myth An Account of the Cultural Revolution Massacre of  in Daoxian Hunan was banned until . Its not banned any more but if you buy it you might be looking for things that are bad about the Chinese government  so it could dock you points if you seem like youre antistate.Its integrated with Didi Kuaidi which is kinda like Uber  officially to see if people are paying the Taxi drivers or stiffing them. But since it can see journey information it would know if you got a taxi to an area where there was a protest and then a taxi away from it when the protest finished. It could dock you points for that.Baidu and Tencent have licenses to issue credit ratings. At this point its like Google being able to rate you and they have access to your search history so can see if youve been searching for bad things Facebook so they can see what youve been posting and if youve got dodgy friends even if you dont do anything even multiplayer gaming spend too much gaming?

9391454,0,t3_58kpa5,I liked this episode overall and I thought they did a good job in telling a story but I found myself getting frustrated with how stupidly the main character was reacting to the situation.Its an obviously desperate play but if youre getting blackmailed by an anonymous entity you cant beat that situation without either locating the guy responsible blackmailing them back or otherwise threatening them somehow using something they find valuable. When youre dealing with anonymous youre basically screwed unless you can somehow manage to track them down which is unlikely anyways. If it were me Id probably text back nah fuck you leak that shit confess what happened in private with my family and then either look for a good lawyer and accept the jail time or flee the country with a new identity. One thing I thought that was interesting was that the boy never asked the man anything like Are you with them? or How do I know you arent with them? I thought that might have been setting up for a big reveal where were shown that the man was orchestrating everything just texting the boys phone right in front of him. Theres a point where the boy receives texts and hes not on his phone but there are services you can use that send texts automatically at a certain time. I was a little disappointed when the ending was just lel I trol u but I guess its appropriate enough. I think this episodes real message was just that people who have been exposed after doing something wrong need to confess to it and those that try run away from their wrongdoings after theyve been made public cant win. Some stuff didnt really pay off but it was a good episode nonetheless. ,blackmirror,d96fm80,6,t5_2v08h

Coercing them into the robbery removed that option. The key here is that the unknowns let Bronn and Kenny choose who would be the robber and who would be the driver. Since only the robbers face is seen by the people in the bank and by the security cameras the unknowns knew they would get absolute control over one of the two but they did not know in advance which. So when Bronn bullies Kenny into the robbery he unknowingly also decides that Kenny will be the one to fight to the death later on.

9496900,0,t3_5auirv,I dont think Black Mirror needs to necessarily always have a cautionary message or whatever...it told a really personable character driven story in this episode using tech as a backdrop.Also if youll remember there are tiny hints that there might be trouble in paradise...At one point Kelly refers to the people at The Quagmire as people who have been here too long and are trying weirder and weirder things in an attempt to feel something. They have become destructively hedonistic and that path eventually leads to like... Cenobites from Hellraiser. The idea is that if you have eternity more or less and can do anything you will eventually get bored or desensitized. That is a very real concern if youre going to upload your consciousness to a machine that will last far far longer than human consciousness is supposed to last. This theme has been played with before in White Christmas and sort of in Playtest. Compounded by the idea that San Junipero may just be that one town...when Kelly drives  MPH and hits that barrier...is that all? Is there nothing beyond it? Is the simulation just that one town? Then it would get old way faster than you would even think. Youd eventually outgrow your eternal sandbox. At least they said you could disconnect yourself easily if you wanted...but then there are the theological concerns. What if youre missing out on real heaven because of this?But more important than that are the humanistic concerns the relationship dynamic that the episode exploreda  year veteran of marriage hooking up with someone who hasnt known anything in her whole life except straight paralysis past age . Do we really think their relationship will last? How are they going to spend their time? Mimicking real life? Get a job? Whats the point when you can snap your fingers and materialize playthings? I think Kelly pegged San Junipero exactly in her tirade against it. She decided to cross over anyway so as not to limit her happiness because it is a fun thing to play around with can you imagine...to be young again!. But eventually it will wind up feeling unsatisfying. But is unsatisfying better than...nothingness? A void? The episode isnt completely lacking in things to think about.

9550972,0,t3_590ubn,Im a native AmE speaker and linguaphile so get ready for a long comment slash rant haha... a lot of the American accents this season sound a bit off to me. Sometimes their accents are glaringly bad and other times there are just small errors in cadence or vowel sounds that give them away.Gugu MbathaRaw Kelly in San Junipero Alice Eve Naomi in Nosedive Malachi Kirby Stripe in Men Against Fire all have great AmE accents. I already knew they were all British actors so I was scrutinizing them extra hard and they are still great! Sarah Snook Medina in Men Against Fire was alright but something about her accent was inexplicably off. Glad to see it confirmed here that shes Australian.James Norton Ryan in Nosedive made a common mistake of British actors trying to play American by sliding into something closer to the Irish accent which is what Id assume theyre more familiar with. He was doing okay until he started yelling and then he sounded completely Irish haha. Both IrE and AmE have the familiar rhotic r but they are decidedly different in a lot of their vowels. Think of how an Irish versus an American might say car  something like kaehr IrE vs kahr AmE.The absolute worst accent for me was the character Len in Men Against Fire. He is trying to do an AAVE  dialect but whats coming out sounds more like an oddlymutated version of MLE His dialogue was nearly unintelligible and I rarely have any issues with accents in AmE or southern dialects of BrE.There are other moments too where I could tell that the script was written by someone British  like in San Junipero Mackenzie Davis Yorkie says of her fiancee Hes called Greg. Ask any native AmE speaker we would never say a sentence like this to identify a person although Ive heard Brits use that construction. In the states we prefer his name is Greg or maybe they call him Greg if Greg is his nickname. Also I think Yorkie slipped a soory or something somewhere and ratted herself out as Canadian haha. Oh yeah and I also speak Japanese and Wunmi Mosakus Katie in Playtest Japanese is super halting and awkward. But then again Ken Yamamura Saitou is doing a pretty bad accented Japanese English accent. He sounds like hes probably really fluent if not a native speaker of English himself. So it all evens out I guess! My only source for all of this is that Im American am very into language and have spent a lot of time both in the UK London and watching British TV! ,blackmirror,d9qcrop,1,t5_2v08h

9606828,0,t1_d9wukbp,I feel you and i agree with your on the Grain and White Bear situation. However i think the rating system would be different. White Bear is a human rights violation that can be ignored by the public. The Grain is not inherently bad it can just be missused. The real life Blocking just has to be tweaked so you cant block people forever. But the rating system is  different. It is widespread discrimination it is the practical abolishment of free speech freedom of the press law and the constitution. It is a police state where everybody else polices everybody else. It is  with a pink paint job. So the rating system affects everyone negatively. Nowadays you can just choose to ignore Facebook instagram and all the other stuff. But when a door wont open because you dont have enough likes or a family member is denied healthcare because of this you will think different. And i disagree with you on the part that People generally dont care. We humans are very empathetic creatures. We dont  want others to suffer. If we do we are classified as sociopaths or psychopaths a mental illness which is frowned upon. And discrimination on the level of Nosedive is widespread suffering.,blackmirror,d9x8kzk,2,t5_2v08h

Scenes from getting bit by sonja telling her about his dad about the bully and getting stabbed by sonja flying in the airplane and so on all relate to some scene in his dream sequence. Could this be the phenomenon where people claim to remember memories the moment they pass and how we have a certain amount of minutes remembering our past? The quote My life flashed before my eyes.

It seemed like all that happened was Kenny was recorded via his webcam. We dont know that to be a fact though. This episode could be ten years in the future where theres a legal reasonable way to determine if the video is accurate or tampered with. If proven to be accurate its absolutely enough for conviction. As for it being obtained illegally we dont know what the laws are at this time which may even be a scarier thought.. Were focusing on the legality of it. Youre saying Kenny should have destroyed his laptop when he was contacted. But thats not the threat is it? The hackers never threatened to send it to the police. They threatened to send it to his family and friends. We have no idea how the police got it or if his family and friends made the police aware of it. The video still would have ruined Kennys life whether he was legally held responsible or not. His mother saw it his sister all of his sisters friends and we can reasonably assume it would spread.

9972440,0,t3_5idtjk,I dont think the phone being in the room mattered. If it did they would take it more seriously and not have it it near him. I think the ringing of the phone may have caused the subconscious part of him that feels guilty for his mother to become too realistic for him mentally. I think he died from a seizure?? Maybe? From him mentally not being able to understand the events he was seeing. It felt like the device was made to tap into the subconscious to creat a situation based on what scares us the most. The phone ringing was the only real stimulus around him. Im sure he probably associates his phone ringing with his mother because she seems to call a few times a day and he didnt seem like he had any relationships with anyone else who would call. So I think the real ring along with  the confusion in the VR the the device created confused his brain and he just couldnt mentally handle it and shut down.

Because we will never get to know how the game really was since everything we know was created by the phone call interference.BUT one thing was real and it was the process of implanting that thing on his head. That really happened. And the episode also shows that the device was really connected to the brain itself since his brain got toasted. As I said the gaming technology advanced very fast over the last years and I think its possible that in the future there will be this kind of procedure to play implanting stuff on the human body. Its pretty scary.And if the present games quality are already enough to keep people so distracted imagine how it will be when the gaming technology gets more and more real?So even though the episode does not show how the real game was supposed to be it makes us think what if we go that way in the future?. What if someone creates a machine that we need to connect to the brain to play?. Thats my point. The episode makes us think about it at least it made me think that way.But I understand what you said and maybe its really not like the rest of Black Birror episodes I agree with you on that. But I think the distraction message was there maybe not so clear like in other episodes but that scene with the girl on the plane for example was there for a reason. ,blackmirror,db9ztue,4,t5_2v08h

Its Pascals Wager for the digital age. It boils down to a heavy discussion about what makes a person themselves. They may upload the brain directly at the time of death and considering that the physical body is dead that makes the code in the computer the closest thing to that person still in existence but does Kelly herself actually experience that reality now that shes dead? She chose to hedge her bets. She gets to die and be buried with her family like she would have been  years ago while at the same time keeping Yorkie happy. SJ for Kelly and for a lot of the commenters represented the idea of being able to have your cake and eat it too. But is that cake real is it really your cake.

10105865,0,t1_dbopm7a,Ive only seen  episodes in the last season so thats why I only gave  episodes as suggestions and I think that San Juperino is the only Black Mirror episode that ended somewhat happily which makes it special. And I think its an episode that is harder to appreciate in the beginning as the futuristic elements come in pretty late which I think might feel cheapdeus ex machina for someone whos new to it.Also I think that the whole episode is very stylish in itself. The themes and cinematography in it are great in themselves. I noticed myself thinking that if this was an episode without any major plot twist and just them riding around in this city  Id still be satisfied. Shut Up and Dance is an incredibly heavy episode and I actually had to take a break after watching it. Then when I resumed to San Juperino it was such a great way to balance out the pit in the stomach which the third episode left. But then again thats just me.NinjaEdit I just realized Ive called the place Juperino and not Junipero. Im not sure which one I think is best.,blackmirror,dbot0nv,1,t5_2v08h

10257764,0,t1_dc6i1en,I keep paralleling this story to the part at the beginning of John Dies At The End where Wong has his dream told by Robert MarleyYou had a dream early this morning in the middle of the thunderstorm.I looked him in the eye.Pfft. Lucky guess . . .In the dream you were back with your girl Tina . . .Whoa howd he knowand you come home and shes there with a big honkin pile of dynamite. One of those big cartoon plunger detonators ready to blow. You ask her what shes doin and she says this and shoves down the handle and he spread his hands in the air boom. Your eyes snapped open. The explosion in your dream became the clap of thunder outside your window. So tell me mon. Am I close?...The thunder came right as she hit the detonator in your dream. Your mind started the dream thirty seconds before the thunderclap. How did it know the thunder would be coming at that moment to coincide with the explosion at the end?Same situation. The AI is constructing the whole story to explain the fatal phone ringing. The AI only knows what Cooper knows. We see that Cooper saw her take the phone and switch it off. We see Cooper switch it back on to take the photo. So why does Katie say she thought the phone was off when she knows she turned it off and then in reality after Cooper is dead says it was an oversight? The phone rings while in the white room before the Gopher game and Katie picks it up and says I thought I switched that off and presumably switches it off again. Why wouldnt she see it was a call from his Mom and not knowing his whole deal with his Mom just answer the phone for him and hand it to him?Why do we see the security camera footage while he is playing the Gopher game? This would mean they knew everything he did in the white room including turning on his phone and sending the photo.Because he did not switch on the phone or send the photo and Katie really did forget to switch off the phone. This means the whole story is the AI explaining this. In . seconds.,blackmirror,dc6rvd6,0,t5_2v08h

10312010,0,t1_dcci1qf,When you turn off an electronic device it suddenly presents you with an extremely unflattering reflection of your double chinny slack jawed lookingdown face. So its a sort of comment on how our identities interact define and are defined by electronic devices and who we really are with and without them.A black mirror or Claude glass is also a device lazy artists used to use to give them a sharp outline of a landscape they could paint. So you could read it as also alluding to the idea of a cheap reductionist approximation of reality  to use one you turn your back on the real image and work from the more visually simple reflection in the grey tinted mirror so youre painting a picture of an image of something rather than the thing itself something satirists of the day made much of. There is something protoCharlie Brookeresque about the idea of a load of daytrippers sitting with their backs to something beautiful so they can record it.Its also the title of a very good   Arcade Fire song which alludes to both these ideas and includes the lines Black mirror black mirrorShot by a security cameraYou cant watch your own imageAnd also look yourself in the eyeBlack mirror black mirror I know a time is comingAll words will lose their meaningPlease show me something that isnt mineBut mine is the only kind that I relate to,blackmirror,dccx7wu,7,t5_2v08h

They are programmed to mimic their humans behaviors exactly and therefore when we observe them in the episode we see them behaving as their human would.

10643714,0,t1_ddav27w,I actually agree with night knew interpretation. If Bing had left his message may have resonated with a couple people but in the end itd be forgotten and nothing would change. As part of the system he can destroy it from the inside. If he can get enough a a fan base or people who believe in his message then he can finally turn the tide and stop his show. This in turn would get the final part of his message across and with the seeds of his ideas already planted and grown in his viewers minds there would be enough people fighting the system that change could occur. I mean imagine if all of his fans  started going to hotshots with his message in mind? Youd have a bunch of people performing and then refusing to take the opportunity to become a hotshot talking directly to the audience or judges attacking the judges or any other way they can think of to get his message across could do? There would be a massive uproar and maybe even a sort of rebellion. In fact they might even try to break out of the complex. Remember that Bing said that people are so used to fake fodder they cant stand any of the real stuff anymore yet he has something real on his desk. He has a real drink but more importantly a wooden bird. Wooden something real something tangible something you can touch and feel beneath your hands. He hasnt forgotten his message hes trying to spread it.,blackmirror,dddtft8,2,t5_2v08h

In fact in English law one can be guilty of murder without intent to actually kill.This element of intention is fulfilled when the defendants motive or purpose was to cause death or serious bodily harm also known as direct intent but also when the defendants motive or purpose was not to cause death or grievous bodily harm but as held by Lord Steyn in R v Woollin death or serious bodily harm was a virtual certainty of the defendants act and the defendant appreciated that to be so also known as oblique intent.

Its objectively the most immediately relatable episode of the  even though it really beats you over the head with the message.For me the suspense and tension builds up internally and creates a general disturbing sense. In every new scene theres a small message about the different ways we use social media or social status to inflict judgment on others.That being said I suppose it really only works if you put yourself in the protagonists shoes and you root for her to find a way to succeed.

11353228,0,t1_dfiotay,Its a joke thats been circulating the internet for a long ass time www.snopes.comcollegeexamhell.asp says a variant of this joke has been around since at least Dr. Schambaugh Final Exam question for May of . Dr. Schambaugh is known for asking questions such as why do airplanes fly? on his final exams. His one and only final exam question in May  for his Momentum Heat and Mass Transfer II class was Is hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer with proof. Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyles Law or some variant. One student however wrote the following First we postulate that if souls exist then they must have some mass. If they do then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell it will not leave. Therefore no souls are leaving. As for souls entering hell lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion then you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion we can project that all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. Now we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyles Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. Two options exist If hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. If hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. So which is it? If we accept the quote given to me by Theresa Manyan during Freshman year that it will be a cold night in hell before I sleep with you and take into account the fact that I still have NOT succeeded in having sexual relations with her then Option  cannot be true...Thus hell is exothermic. The student got the only A.,blackmirror,dfiv8hh,8,t5_2v08h

Basically hacking is all about figuring out broken or unexpected behavior in a program and exploiting it in ways you know will make the program do what you want  so hed not only have to find the bug but also figure out how he can use the bug to get outinto the internet. Since its a bug the unexpected behavior could be anything  hence the risk of crashing things. So the answer is maybe if theres something he can exploit in the program.,blackmirror,dfpiue7,2,t5_2v08h

That eventually beats anything you can use for defence.Plus those people are going to need food and water supplies regardless of where they are perhaps bees got in through the people bringing them foodwater or perhaps they dehydrated and died.,blackmirror,dfu4yca,4,t5_2v08h
