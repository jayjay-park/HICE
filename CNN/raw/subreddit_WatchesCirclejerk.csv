1142018,0,t3_276crl,Im worried about the future of this subreddit.I think we spend too much time jerking over the second best watch ever the Speedmaster. I think we need to get with the times the new second best watch ever is clearly the Seamaster Aqua Terra.Best watch ever obviously being the entire Seiko collection. Yes theyre all equally the best watch ever.,WatchesCirclejerk,chy36nm,9,t5_2tum7

1447151,0,t1_cixk5st,Getting a Seiko  regularly serviced is the most important thing a man can do in his life. I got my Seiko  serviced at  years and  day and now I am no longer in good health. Im slowly getting back to wearing it in good health by getting it serviced immediately after I pick it up from being serviced.,WatchesCirclejerk,cixod6f,10,t5_2tum7

2957769,0,t3_2sxsnp,Oh my god yes. The combination of the terrible watch and the MLMesque self improvement rambling is like my sweet spot of hate watching. I couldnt make satire this goodAnother great one. Invicta reminds him of his business partners become invincible in business. I dont know how thick this watch is but I used to be a machinist and Im gonna guess this watch is at least half an itch thick. The guy doesnt know how many months have less than  days. Dont quote him but its more than one. The strap is so wide so divers could strap it on their wetsuit which wouldnt be length of course and the wide strap is also proof that the guts of the watch are big unlike all the other big watches at Macys. The generic backface with a logo is an example of a noncheap looking caseback. Oh man its gold.,WatchesCirclejerk,co4ba36,2,t5_2tum7
