6316933,0,t1_cyw1zcl,I have read up to  and Im pretty sure I should use spoiler tags if I wanna discuss anything... theres no point in combining all chapters into one thread when there are always people who read the raws. ,BokuDakegaInaiMachi,cz7ny3g,3,t5_3b3k1
6451425,0,t1_czmivxl,March stAnd I think it needs to be someone introduced before March st since the Mom in the future said she recognized and identified the killer. However... A strong rebuttal for this argument is that all suspects had an alibi for the timeframe in which Kayo would be murdered. Except for Kayos mothers boyfriend!!!!!!! This means it was in my mind him or someone not introduced yet. It really seems like it would be the teacher though...Satoru has also certainly changed things but whether or not these changes will affect Kayos survival isnt clear yet.,BokuDakegaInaiMachi,czmma46,2,t5_3b3k1

6646127,0,t1_d06qdfm,No but saying something is a spoiler can be a spoiler. Like youll never see the twist ending with bruce willis in the sixth sense coming is a spoiler. It draws attention to something that might have been ignored.,BokuDakegaInaiMachi,d06rmy1,3,t5_3b3k1
