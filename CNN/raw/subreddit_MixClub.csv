277394,0,t1_cf9i50m,Wow thanks for all those details! Regarding the DI I was just thinking about using it along with the audio for the options. I found myself wanting to take some of the distortion out of the bass without sacrificing some of its tone so I thought a DI stem might have helped out a bit as I can process the DI ITB with a lot more flexibility as to compliment the best parts of the original bass track.Anyway again great job on the song. Also Im out of Louisiana too. Surprised I never heard of these guys. ,MixClub,cf9ij9m,3,t5_2xluu
377115,0,t1_cfi4xpi,It is certainly tricky on this song the guitars are unusually dark oddly the engineer who recorded this prefers it that way he manages alright so it must has some worth!. I found using a Pultech worked well being able to bring out the subharmonics without actually boosting signal level is a huge plus. You might try the same! ,MixClub,cfjuqc7,1,t5_2xluu
591118,0,t1_cg7gik1,Awesome how do you like the Tascam? I remember way back when I started recording I used allot of Tascam gear good stuff ,MixClub,cg7gpkn,1,t5_2xluu

932568,0,t3_24r84x,my mixsilly snare fx.EDIT I split the stereo guitar tracks to put distortion on one set automation to bring that set up during the choruses.,MixClub,chaad8a,2,t5_2xluu
967890,0,t1_chasrz1,That is a nice mix. As kkantouth said maybe s a bit of high shelving on the vox to help it have its own space. Nothing else I could honestly suggest.,MixClub,cheb4nx,1,t5_2xluu
1013322,0,t3_25cc50,Heres my mix and master for comparisonScreenshots for those interestedThis was a toughie for the drums of course would be keen know what happened to those OHs! but Im happy with the overall gist of it. Still not sold entirely on what I was able to get drum wise but ah well. Really the challenge I found was in the chorus  the verse was fine but as the drums got more active in the chorus my mixes were falling apart  Im relatively happy with where I landed though.I found myself going way less guitar heavy than a lot of the other mixes as I really thought this was more of a pop song than a rock song. So my mixcutting of parts is an attempt at making it more pop really.,MixClub,chjgzsh,2,t5_2xluu
1058728,0,t1_chmockj,You could probably use a limiter if you think its necessary or use elastic and cut down on the actual waveform. You could also break that specific section of the file and turn down the clip gain. The last two are pro tools specific so it may not apply to you but I think some stepped limiting would definitely do the trick without sacrificing the quality.,MixClub,chomr65,1,t5_2xluu
1176399,0,t1_chxtjp9,Ill agree with your comment on Nectar. I played with the demo and on several vocal tracks and could not get a good sound out of it.   I actually like the electric guitar in this. It has the country twang just right.  ,MixClub,ci1yqvc,1,t5_2xluu
1230353,0,t1_ci80xx4,Hey just for reference what are you listening on? I know Soundclouds kps MPs sound crap but it seems to really be accentuating the high end of my mix. I just streamed the SC mix to my phone and I can see exactly what you are saying. Listen to a kps MP on the same device and same headphones and it is like light and day.,MixClub,ci8165t,2,t5_2xluu
1783567,0,t3_2efti3,Hi all this is my first of hopefully many submissions to Mix Club. Im  and I am currently studying music technology A level in Sixth Form College. I restrained myself from listening to the other submissions before mixing my own and things I would change about my mix after hearing the others would be to add more depth to the guitars perhaps fatten up that snare some more and even out the bumps in that waveform but The track was mixed on a PowerMac G with Logic Studio . Id like to hear what you guys think about it what you like and what I could improve of it. Cheers. ,MixClub,ck3z0p6,1,t5_2xluu

8904941,0,t3_524lls,Im having a little trouble understanding your question but Ill try to answer.It sound like youre getting caught up on something thats not really important and perhaps losing sight of what is important. The loudness of the stems really doesnt matter very much as long as they have a little headroom. No mixing engineer is going to care if they are  or .The more important question is what are the dynamics like? Are you brick walling your stems to hit a certain db level? The engineer wants good dynamics much more than some specific amount of headroom. Just make sure they arent  db or clipping and youre fine.Ive never heard anyone discuss RMS and peak levels concerning stem mixes. Stems are meant to be remixed so the RMS just doesnt matter. Your stems should definitely not be  rms though. Youre kiling them if your doing that.You say you use a analyzer to check your levels but how are you achieving these levels? Just with fader movements? Are you using limiters on your stems and your master?,MixClub,d7i8tz8,2,t5_2xluu
