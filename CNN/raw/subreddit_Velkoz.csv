7227189,0,t1_d1zo68t,Runes. That explains it. oGood for you. Mana Regeneration Runes could be a thing soon in an age where Mana Regeneration Items will be replaced by flat mana.Which reminds me...the difference between ManaReg seals and ManaReg glyphs are only . per level.  seals gives you . mana per second while  glyphs gives you . mana per second.Im sure that . mana per second or  mana per  seconds are not that impactful and could build some armor seals over ManaReg seals but that depends of playstyle and how the Mid Year Mage Update influences VelKoz.,Velkoz,d1zoea4,1,t5_30409

7505923,0,t3_4i617k,well since the rework i only played  games in mid the rest of my games where all on top lane and for top lane he is more viable than old vel koz,Velkoz,d2vdv7s,2,t5_30409
7581487,0,t1_d33q2at,My suggestion which would synergize with the idea of hiding his qrange would be to make the Researched debuff not visible by the opposing team. When people get that research debuff it seems they know when you will ult and they start disengaging or taking action to mitigate the time caught in the ult. However if you hide that marker then you dont necessarily have to Ult right away and you can wait for the best opportunity and possibly get a few more spells out to research other targets. I will say that I had the opportunity to land an ult on  researched targets in a team fight and it was glorious very rewarding!,Velkoz,d33z7vj,1,t5_30409
7583428,0,t1_d346y9h,Well we all need to come to terms with the fact that that will never happen. Velkoz will never be the same as before. Im just trying to preserve some of his previous strength while giving him a meaningful but not overly strong change. ,Velkoz,d3475zm,1,t5_30409

7688679,0,t1_d3g5hg2,Yeah we were so close  to reaching the  mark in our EUW Velkoz main club but now multiple people just start leaving only because of this rework. But Im afraid Rito thinks its solved now that Velkoz has  winrate.Also he said it destroyed the elegance of setting conditionals not that it would be OP. But in my opinion the lost elegance of his fluid combo outweighs the elegance hes talking about. I think he was underestimating the importance of that combo being fluid. Not being able to use your E to keep someone inside your combo is the difference between a kill and a death. I played versus a Shyvana if I didnt use my E to get her into the Researched state then the ultimate wouldnt even be worth casting considering the risk you take by locking yourself down for . seconds. And if I didnt use it to keep her inside my ultimate she just jumps straight at me through the ultimate forcing me to cancel and flash away. Your proposed additional slow wouldnt really help against gap closers whereas the E suspension would. But hey it never made sense in the first place for him to deal with the champions right in front of him since he is supposed to be weak when champions are closing in.,Velkoz,d3g5k1z,2,t5_30409
7756537,0,t1_d3nuw6c,But thats  True Damage that you could boost further by using more AP. Void Staff gives  AP whereas Seraphs Embrance gives  AP. Thats  AP difference which is a lot considering a  AP ratio on his passive and a  AP ratio on his Ultimate.,Velkoz,d3nuyg5,1,t5_30409
7768926,0,t1_d3p0e3z,Yeah Im pretty sure CS is a major factor. My friends are always like But wtf our scores are like the same how did you get S and I got A and I just point at our massive CS difference,Velkoz,d3p9jic,2,t5_30409
7812941,0,t3_4mbnqe,Im loving this revamp of the revamp. Having stacks in the ultimate was so crucial.,Velkoz,d3u8m5i,2,t5_30409
7880696,0,t1_d40n1jz,I only go Ludens if the ADC sucks and the team needs me to act as carry. ADC goes ham enemy team engages I combo. The ADC gets assists and if were lucky he even gets to live with a kill or two in the bag.,Velkoz,d41v3ro,1,t5_30409
7890394,0,t3_4ndfue,Velkoz does not really benefit from armour pen. I think movement speed quints are the best late game option for velkoz.,Velkoz,d42yc1j,1,t5_30409
7942831,0,t3_4o0e6u,something that is usually a waste of a flash but sometimes a good way to get your ult of in a teamfight without being interrupted is flashing over a wall and then ulting. it makes it a lot harder to interrupt your ult and since they cant see you it also makes it hard for them to dodge your Q. The only times ive done this and havent feel like i wasted a ult is if they collapse on my team and they are clumped up. It can turn a shit situation around sometimes.,Velkoz,d48ujr3,4,t5_30409
8097478,0,t3_4nz8my,No love for stormraiders surge? It allows you play pretty far up the lane early.,Velkoz,d4q89pa,1,t5_30409
8658879,0,t1_d6ny1xj,oh I see but wouldnt you reduce your kill pressure if you go faerie charm insetad of spellthiefs? Also would this build be any good? frostfang lost chapter sightstone finish morello finish EOW ludens into offensivedefensive items and boots somewhere between ludens and morello  I guess. I just think morello is a really good item. AP  Mana and the grievous wound will always be useful if they have an adc. Plus it means I can just spam abilities all I want which creates pressure if Im good at them. The  cdr also means I can just run ap on my runes. If Im not buying zhonyaabyssal I can go ionian and if I am I can get sorcs. this would be the rune page.EDIT Actually Id probably swap the seals for mpen or ap. I dont need anymore mana regen becasue of morello.EDIT TIL Mpen seals dont exist.EDIT Ok couldnt think of any good seals to replace the mana regen with so just went with x armor. The rune page is now this  Do you think Id need meditations in my masteries? I think morello EOW will be enough but I dont know.,Velkoz,d6nz4h8,1,t5_30409

9163415,0,t3_552v4u,Ignite is great for early game cheese but in lane i generally try to keep a steady poke on my opponent until . At  i let them misstep and then pop them with an ability  ult which is usually enough for a kill or back without an ignite. Since vel koz is so immobile ajd squishy i think ignite is wasted on him. Long cooldown and if you get ganked and have burned flash you might as well enter the store early. I generally take ghost barrier or exhaust. Ghost gives great escape roam and positioning advantage on a very short cooldown while barrier helps mitigate an all in from an opposing assasin. I generally only take exhaust if im against a zed to ruin his ult damage.With ghost on vel i can fly into a teamfight pop an e aggresively  wherever i want to and roll out to unleash the second wave of w and q  ult. Also if you ward well ghost is a good emergency escape isntead of having to burn a flash everytime you over extend.,Velkoz,d8dj2z3,2,t5_30409
9501716,0,t1_d9k0ets,One game i was against  merc treads a riven with  null magicmantles and a draven doing pene build with Maw second but he only had Hex at the time. I went void rd that game. Was that good?And a question. In my mind there is  possible nd items Ludens Dcap and Rylais. I know about rylais being inefficient but i sometimes like having a safe midgame with the extra HP. But after some thought Rylais does also gives HP. So basically what ur saying is that my nd item Rylais should be replaced with Liandries?  Is Liandries really worth as a second item?,Velkoz,d9kaf2v,1,t5_30409
9527651,0,t1_d9nh905,The only skill Rylais effects is the W as slows dont stack and after the rework it no longer effects his passive proc. Because of this there are better items to fit in those  nonboot slots than Rylais. Not a bad item but not optimal.Edit further as Vel you should be able to kite effectively with just Q and E especially with the CDR from Lucid Morelos and runes. If they can still get to you after all that theres not very many situations where the W slow will save you at that point ,Velkoz,d9nhg9f,1,t5_30409

10385403,0,t1_dckn1nu,A little probably. Ludens is really good on Vel though. If Im getting fed or my back timings just work out Ill sometimes get ludens before I finish Morello but after lost chapter. It depends on enemy team comp. Liandrys is really good against health stacking tanks plus you get some pen which is always nice since you generally dont get void until last item on Vel.But if theyre all squishy liandrys doesnt do as much for you. Might as well just build full murder squid with Morello ludens dcap first three items,Velkoz,dcl905e,1,t5_30409

10848126,0,t3_5v25sy,As usupermetro said it before. Vel would lose to many popular matchups. And thats the point where you can win if your matchup knowledge is better than theirs. Bruisers are weak against you until level  poke them down with speels and AAs. Tanks requiere you to wait for their shields to be down care for the jungle gank.Try toplane if you feel confident otherwise you should better stay mid and support.Edit First game against renekton  after laning phase second game adc VelKoz Need also to say that this is my second account and Im not in my actuall ELO,Velkoz,ddywozt,3,t5_30409
