10682257,0,t3_5smo6f,I wish this was better poetry. Im not sure how youre hoping to sell it when you only show two poems that dont trigger any kind of strong emotion when I read them and you dont even talk about the kind of poetry you do. have you looked into how to market poetry at all or is this just expressing yourself? ,shamelessplug,ddhslc5,1,t5_2rfqv
10707091,0,t3_5t1fw9,This is incredible! How do you allow the filtering by attributes like tempo? Did you write a ml classifier? Or do you use an already existing databaseapi? EDIT punctuation ,shamelessplug,ddkcujo,1,t5_2rfqv

10792175,0,t3_5ubvuk,Take for example your video Crunchy Roll Cast amp Ability Pen Build! Paragon Fighter Crunch HD GameplayWhich part of that title is the actual game? Crunchy roll? Paragon fighter? Paragon? Paragon fighter crunch? Your title formats are inconsistent I cant even look at the other videos to figure out which part of the title is usually the game. Three in a row the brackets at the end are used for FPS Game name Commentary. Your channel is called  MINUTES OF GAME but none of your videos seem to be  minutes. I get that its a play on  minutes of fame but it doesnt fit with anything. Theyre just you silently facelessly playing games and uploading the recording. On this Crunchyroll one you have the volume turned waaay down so its practically a silent game. Youve littered the video with ads nobody wants that and you dont have the viewers to justify it.Look at what the popular channels are doing differently and do that. Video titles that make sense. Someone they can relate to. A suitable volume level. Commentary that is actually someone talking about the game as they are playing not just with mic turned on so you can hear us talking to each other purely about what move to do next. Not being greedy with the ads.,shamelessplug,ddt4xjb,8,t5_2rfqv

11011021,0,t1_deg262t,I play games that are less terrible I definitely laid into that one a bit in the video haha it was crap. If you liked what you saw and wish the game sucked less you really may enjoy some of my other stuff its not all terrible garbage. Its hit or miss with indie games I dont know if play many but there are many hits too. Thanks for watching! ,shamelessplug,deg2hap,1,t5_2rfqv
11407037,0,t3_59301j,The best and safest way is to get a prescription from your doctor and get it from your local pharmacy. Walm Mart has got good prices on Cialis Levitra and Viagra. You can also try to order viagra online the only problem with buying viagra online is that there are so many sh..ty places all over the net that you can easily get lost and get ripped in the end. you must be very careful if you choose to order meds over the net. a good source for ed meds like viagra cialis levitra is  I hope I helped you,shamelessplug,dfoz2g5,1,t5_2rfqv
11773464,0,t1_dgt3ars,Thanks! Thats a pretty good idea. It would be super simple to take this code and flip it to make any sort of site thats dependent upon a location search. Ive actually got another in mind right now that I want to build. But a site for business portrait photographers is a good idea. I havent seen a site like that out there. Hard part though is once its built you have to promote it and try to get people to sign up. Turns out people dont willynilly sign up for new sites.So far I have around  members which seems to confirm that theres actually a want for a site like FamSnap so hopefully I can continue to build. gtYour site is impressively quick  especially when typing in my zip.Thanks. I built it with Python and Django which isnt the fastest framework but its fast enough. I think biggest props goes to Digital Ocean. Their servers are great. ,shamelessplug,dguk10z,1,t5_2rfqv
