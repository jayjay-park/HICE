7760215,0,t3_4ll6m4,. For Blank I wanted to make a tutorial video on how to model an animatronic I wanted to model a blank character so people could see how to make the very basics of a FNAF animatronic. But when I was halfway through I realized that I had forgotten to record it all and I liked how it had turned out so I didnt want to delete it all and restart. So I just finished Blank as he was and added childrens drawings all over him to give him purpose.For the Penguin all I wanted was a new design of an animatronic instead of a typical humanoid animal. So I designed him as a penguinshaped penguin character on little wheels like RD.Chester was pretty much a filler the general idea arose from those creepy monkey toys like the one in Toy Story .. Yes.. Improvisation.. Nope.. I cant say.. Hes somewhere in the factory but if you want to get technical then you could say that he is hauntinghacking the surveillance system.. I cant say.. In that location yes they were the only ones there.. I just put the origami cat on the Penguins head because I thought it would look nicer than if the origami cat was sitting on the  floor.. Company choices. Perhaps they only had money to get Candy and Cindy an upgrade and maybe they scrapped Chester because they thought he would look out of place compared to the New Candy and New Cindy? The Penguin wasnt scrapped though.. Because plot.,fivenightsatcandys,d3o9yr4,2,t5_396hd
