He implements a lot more breaking pop lock kind of moves than the style from my original link. How long did it take you to start looking good? Were you already a dancer before you decided to take on this style?Thanks for the tips btw.,Dance,cf39sgo,1,t5_2qhs0

It takes a lot of force to get the brain to move enough to hitbe damaged by the skull. Our bodies dont waste space and leave room for our brain to move. Think of it like a very well packed box if everything is squeezed in tight enough nothing moves in transportation. Spotting is no more dangerous to the brain as jumping skipping or walking.

Thanks for the long replyI would gladly join but im actually really shy and dont feel comfortable sharing videos of myself dancing online although I have recorded myself in the past to see how I did.The problem for me is that I dont really have fun unless I see improvement. I have fun if I feel like im doing my best.Basically if something doesnt look good to me I wont be satisfied with it until its at a level that I wouldnt mind showing others.Even if I practice a lot I feel like im missing A LOT out from techniques and basics I guess. Mimicking how someone dances is one thing but I feel like actually knowing how to dance the way it was meant to be performed is another. ,Dance,ckqi3cc,2,t5_2qhs0

I think you need to dance and practice more P.  Baby steps.  Keep your big plans in mind but in the meantime put on some music and spend time feeling what your body naturally wants to do.  And WATCH YOUTUBE videos to get inspired!My favorite dancers are Storyboard P Ghost of BSV SamIAm Sallah maybe its Salah? Poison Ivy Les Twins.   Watch them or whoever you like and observe with your mirror neurons.  Meaning be empathetic.  Notice how they use their energy.  Notice what kind of concepts or styles they are drawn to.

4928989,0,t1_cuf3ujb,Lmfao have I told you this before? Or you always see my posts?

XDBut I was just asking if it strictly has to be this type of hip hop style and this exact same feel.Im not sure if you like the softer kind of hip hop choreography  which I personally enjoy. Which is like what the Kinjaz do sometimes. Or do you mostly like the gritty traplike Im a bad bitch ayeee cool type of choreography? Which is what I see. I guess it all depends on the music. ,Dance,cufu6wv,2,t5_2qhs0

Why would you do that?!?! Its so fun to learn about locking popping house breaking and even other styles! Its so unfair to the new dancer to just stick to those choreos. ,Dance,cw4izer,2,t5_2qhs0
5429829,0,t1_cw5c9ea,See the original comment by R went something like thisgt Try to stay away from hip hop classes that are just one teacher teaching a new choreo every week. It might not really be hip hop and just their interpretive movement to rappopRnBtrap and other songs that reflect their personal taste in music. Choreos are typically less groovy and are more reflective of someone whos already developed their own style. If you like how they move then it works out because you will eventually start to dance like them. But grooves are like a blueprint without the individual touch leaving that all up to you. Thats why I suggest you go that route if possible.Its important that you learn how to be... yourself and groove while also learning attentively from other people. Its like a beginner artist being told to only draw in watercolour. So that beginner artist actually never realizes that heshe has so many more dance techniques that could be at their disposal and so many more styles to draw in. The beginner dancer needs to learn these things first or at the very least be able to grasp the big concepts of hip hop dance like robotting krumping house breaking  and ideally also learn the history of hip hop dance D And then move onto dancing choreos or do whatever else they want like battle in freestyles help teach others make their own choreos.Oh and like you saidgt To be fair I live in NYC and the opportunity to take lots of classes in lots of different styles might not be the same where you live.That is GOOD! That is great!Unfortunately some dance places are not as diverse as New York ones. ,Dance,cw5psqv,1,t5_2qhs0
5573829,0,t3_3rf4h8,When someone sings a cover of a song its easy to give credit where its due. At the talent show youd say Ill be singing  by  and youre set.Its quite difficult to perform someone elses music and pass it off as ones own. Music artists also have clear and explicit rights to their own work and if someone doesnt give them credit theres a course of action that can be taken to remedy that. In addition the artist makes royalties based on how many people purchased their song or album. When an artist puts a song out they continue making money off of the song as long as people are paying for it.Now heres why dance is different. When a choreographer teaches choreography to a class they are not paid for the choreography. When we post our choreography online it is to inspire and entertain but mostly it is to promote our work and the classes we teach. The idea here is that if you like what you saw online youll come pay to take our classes. Most higher level studios pay instructors based on the number of students they get so when you teach yourself their class choreography for your own use without paying even to take the class you effectively take money from our pockets. And thats just by using class footage. Using pieces that a choreographer actually set on a group of dancers is actually quite a bit worse. See when we are hired to choreograph for a group we are paid not just for teaching but for the right to perform the choreography. A single recital piece at some studios can cost anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to more than a thousand depending on what its being used for and how many people are in it and that doesnt include paying the instructor for the time it takes to teach it. So when you take that piece and use it for your own performance without paying or getting permission youre definitely stealing. On top of it choreography is something that often incorporates details that can easily be missed on a video so chances are that if youre learning from the video you arent even executing the choreography the way it was meant to be done. Its one thing to cover a song and put your own spin on it but choreography can be a much more specific thing and it leaves less room for changing it up that a vocal cover does.What makes it harder still is that there isnt a clear system in place for maintaining our artistic rights. With music there are albums recordings time and date stamps and other things that clearly state who owns what and who else can use it. There is a system for how to pay royalties and how to use the work in a fairuse setting. Dance doesnt have any of this. People seem to think that because we made a video we want everyone to go out and recreate our work on their own. That could not be further from the truthUltimately the general rule is this borrowing a few moves here or there isnt usually a big deal. Being inspired isnt a big deal. But copying a choreographers work without permission is a very big deal. And not giving credit to the real creator is a very big deal. We count on being paid for our choreography in order to keep working.The real answer to your question is this if youre looking to use a choreographers piece HIRE the person to teach you. However if you really must use a certain choreographers work from a YouTube video this is what to doContact the choreographer directly or their agent if necessary if you have to speak to their agent be prepared to hear no or be prepared to have to pay. Find out whether theyd be ok with you recreating the choreography they may ask you to pay. If they do happen to say yes make sure to find out exactly how the person would like you to credit them. Some want it in writing some will ask you to tag them in anything that gets posted some will ask to see footage before they allow you to post anything online. Then follow up after.TLDR Yes using someone elses choreography is stealing and its shameful. And no it is not like making a cover of a song. Never assume a choreographer will be ok with you performing their work without knowledge permission credit or payment. It doesnt matter how big or small the performance is.,Dance,cwnzgwa,3,t5_2qhs0

8212187,0,t1_d52iv0z, This is actually the tutorial video to the Panda video you linked to If you go to the channel itself he has a lot more videos on dance.But you probably need more beginner stuff right? Well that is a problem I have been seeing as well. There are unfortunately no good and direct tutorials online. Just fragments of dance tutorials here and there. This is because the bread and butter of a dancer are their lectures and dance workshops. A dancer is out of work if there is a great tutorial online. This channel Vincanitv teaches you about breaking a.k.a. official Hip Hop and there are a few things about House Popping Locking and more too This channel James Barry teaches you techniques in Popping This website Steezy has a bunch of articles and videos on dance. They also have this great feature where you sign up and you can get cool lessons from real dance choreographers like Bam Martin. Eventually ya gotta pay though D There are some more and Ill keep hunting for you but the overall thing to keep in mind is...Every beginner dancer started simply by... dancing. You might get overwhelmed with all this stuff online. But before the age of online stuff all dancers danced. They followed other dancers. They danced to the music themselves.They watched their favorite dance idols in music videos. If you can dance and are confident enough to dance for yourself and around other people like these people in the Cant Stop the Feeling Video with Justin Timberlake and the Happy Video with Pharrell then youre already  of the way there!Then if you want to get into specific dance styles you start absorbing specific videos on popping locking breaking contemporary etc!,Dance,d542tj9,1,t5_2qhs0
