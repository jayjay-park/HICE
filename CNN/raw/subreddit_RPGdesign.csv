For example your highest Chakra is  your lowest is  so you have to roll higher than a  on your luck roll.Maybe you could call this luck roll spirit roll and it is something the players have to do frequently.

3168337,0,t1_coqadky,Questions that came to my mind Does resting remove all exhaustion? When does the reactor choose how many dice he rolls  how much exhaustion will be build up? Why should I want to block at all? It seems more effective to just do a full attack every other round and rest inbetween.Also Determining initiative doesnt seem intuitive as resting happens reguarly and may often include ties. For something that is new every round it seems like quite an effort. I can say nothing about probabilities but it seems youre likely to fail often. What is the good thing about your system?

3195327,0,t3_2wpr4o,Heres how I would have done it. I would avoid having Tolkienesque elves owning the world and all that because that would be like . of all the other RPGs out there.Dwarves  came from a meteor. Could be a starship could be a spell that was meant to save them from their homeworld nobody knows. Only thing they know is that their ancestors came from a world of liquid fire and black glass.Halflings  came from the moon. Shortly after it exploded from a collision with a meteor ahem. Their ancestors have mastered the art of walking between planes and used to be able to travel the universe by gatewalking through a series of astral gates. Sadly that knowledge is now lost.Orcs  a race that came from the same world as the dwarves rumoured to be the pilots of the meteor that carried them here. The Orcs maintain a tradition of a small enclave of elders that all know the origins of the dwarves and their ultimate destiny but after the dwarves awoke and slaughtered many Orcs theyre not really in a sharing mood.Elves  originally singlecelled amoebas on the moon cultivated by the halflings as food the elves rose from a green lake where they rapidly evolved in a mere thousand years. They are now savages under the protection and care of the halflings although some say the halflings still see the elves as food.Humans  original natives of the world. They witnessed the explosion of the moon from a collision with a meteor and when the meteor struck half the world perished. Thousands of years later alien species rose in the far outskirts of civilisation and several terrible wars later all humans were driven underground biding their time to regain their rightful place in the world.Dragonborn  dont be silly.

Make the effect of the roll greater.If you guessed the one that always works was  then you are correct. If you roll d to complete a single action why not allow that one roll to apply to all of the rest of the times you perform that action unless something drastically changes like BWs Let it Ride?

4297880,0,t1_cs9dqkn,Regarding simultaneous combat yes that is the brunt of it. The logistical difficulties of managing this style impart some more details in practice of course. Without getting too into details in order to avoid chaos the DM must still arbitrate the round so tools are in place to facilitate the cognitive load keeping track of everything is for the DM. Additionally there are further guidelines in place to facilitateencourage roleplay. Since things are happening simultaneously order of description is entirely subjective and the DM sort of has directorial control of this order. As a side effect the need for combat strategy and coordination between teammates goes up as it would in real life. Since this is such a crucial pipeline I wont claim its done since any kind of mechanical wrinkle has to work with it but disengagement is effectively gone in the system. Every player has information to react to and choices to make at nearly all times.Regarding choices I admit I could have been a little more clear about what I see as the nature of emergent complexity in RPGs. Lets use Chess as a counterexample. The difference between a chess master and a novice is huge. What seems like a good move to a novice may be a terrible move. The difference between them is their understanding and studying of the game. The best moves are typically a small sub set of the available moves and are hidden from those who do not have a high level of skill at the game. The game of Chess clearly measures your skill and mastery of the game and produces an objective result.Now imagine this takes place in an RPG. Two players have the same intention to be a great fighter. But one of them with a deep understanding of the game will succeed while the other will fail. He may flavor his choices anyway he wants but his fighter is objectively bad because he does not understand the game well enough for this to be real.Now this breaks the spirit of an RPG. The goal is to be anything you want not to see if you have studied the game long enough to see if this is true. So in this spirit choices at character creation should all be good and at the very least deliver what they say they do. Or to put another way the veteran and the novice should both be able to build a great fighter no hidden system mastery required.Once the game hits the road and these master fighters are actually fighting things change dramatically. A fight should almost always have some level of danger because no matter of skill should make the fighter infallible not to mention boring. So point one it should not be possible to be so good that the challenges are trivialized. Failure is always an option no matter how skilled the player is.Next both master fighters should have the same kind of tactical options open to them. But they must be choices with consequences. Being aggressive may end the fight more quickly but being defensive may give the fighter a higher chance of surviving the fight. Point being a master fighter has choices reflective of a master fighter regardless of the players system skill. What matters in this case is their values situational knowledge and resource management. If life is low is it more important to get in the killing blow or to protect themselves? Once tired and hurt is it better to keep up the fight or to run? Based on the enemies tactics should I flank them or go straight at them? Should I plan an ambush or meet them head on? Should I protect my weaker allies or take out as many possible? These are all important decisions with huge repercussions but all are in reach of both the novice and veteran. And any master fighter may be met with these choices and have roughly the same chance at succeeding or failing. They arent made because of system skill but based on whatever current information the character has the characters personal values and whatever seems like a good idea at the time. This is depth from value of given knowledge as opposed to depth from skill at seeing hidden knowledge in the system.Or thats my take anyway. Generally I guess what Im trying to say is depth matters in an RPG but it comes from a different place than traditional games and systems should optimize for that kind of depth and those choices. And if this seems an indictment of the many failings of DampD . thats probably because it is haha.,RPGdesign,csa3eob,1,t5_31cnk

4977542,0,t3_3j3jax,If youre looking for a dice system you could reduce it from  to  and have each level represent a different level of die or simply say every other level you get a die increase from D to D ect.I would need more info on what exactly you are asking for more detail.,RPGdesign,culyg0k,2,t5_31cnk
4985171,0,t3_3j3jax,Better Angels uses the following system. See this character sheet for reference You have Strategies which are like major stats  and Tactics which are like minor stats or skills. Both are limited to five . When you attempt an action you roll a dice pool of a Strategy combined with a Tactic. This gives a die pool from zero to ten dice. You are looking for sets of dice. Like a pair of s or triple s. Each set is a success. Both Strategies and Tactics and are in opposing pairs with the one on the right being Virtuous and the one on the left being Sinister. Each opposing pair is capped at a total of  dots. Visually an opposing pair never overlaps on your character sheet as Sinister traits fill in from the left while virtuous traits fill in from the right. While individual stats are capped at  and pairs are capped at  some of your stats will often be far lower than this. You might have zero Greed and zero Generosity but have five Cowardice and two Endurance. Normally when you take a hit both in combat but also in debates and emotional arguments the relevant stat slides to the other side. So if someone punches you a point of your Courage becomes a point of Cruelty and if you are out of Cruelty you slide your Open over to Sly. Another example if someone lectures you about why stealing is good and they succeed against you then you slide a point of Greed over to Generosity.   Particularly strong attacks wide sets that are larger than just a pair can sometimes erase a dot of a tactic instead of just sliding it. Even stronger hits can directly attack the Strategy above that Tactic. In combat specifically there are  main methods one might attack.  You could attack someone in a fair melee combat like a duel or a boxing match  this would be Open Courage.   You could beat up weaklings or your underlings like punching an old man in the face  that would be Open Cruelty.  You could use an unfair method to attack a daunting foe like firing a sniper rifle at Hitler  that would be Sly Courage.  And you can use an unfair method to injure those beneath you like spraying an SMG into a crowd of civilians  that would be Sly Cruelty. All physical harm attacks Courage by default.So anyway that is yet another way to have opposing stats. The opposites are linked such that attacks even moral emotional or social attacks like lectures seduction or heated arguments slide your stats around changing how you feel and how you act or at least how effective you are at certain actions.The opposing stats dont have to be strong anywhere. You can be low on both ends of the spectrum.Combat is based on the moral hows and whys of the fight not what weapon you are using or even how strong you are.,RPGdesign,cumwbgx,1,t5_31cnk

5174365,0,t3_3ln39x,Dont forget clip size!I have thought about this in regards to a game like XCom. If you have any sort of reaction firecover mechanic this can be restricted by an effective covering arc of the gun. Something like a pistol or uzi can cover a greater arc to represent its maneuverability. A sniper rifle is great for covering a single door however.Another option is scatter. Its an inherent inaccuracy in the gun itself. One of the problems with guns in RPGs is the unrealistic way that range affects chancetohit. A flat penalty for range means if your skill is high enough you can hit a called shot with a pistol at  meters. The bullet doesnt travel that accurately. In a simple RPG system I would implement this as a skill cap for that weapon. The skill cap is applied after bonuses and penalties range should affect target number not the attack roll.You can also give guns perklike bonuses or penalties such as multiple attacks for a shotgun stopping power for a Desert Eagle sniperrifles require a round to steady.Shadowrun gives weapons a concealment rating how hard they are to hide on your person.One thing to keep in mind is that ammunition is actually the basis for all damage. A mm fired from one gun does the same amount of damage as the same mm from another gun although silencers that slow the bullet may affect this.,RPGdesign,cv9p90i,2,t5_31cnk

5353710,0,t1_cvuyk23,This is an interesting point. When designing games you want to have multiple levels of attack at solving the issue of players understanding something. Your argument is basically that having cards means you wont take other steps. This assumes a certain lack of thoroughness. In a practical sense you may be right most of the time but I dont agree with stance that you should not use them. Instead you should design the rest of the game with the assumption you wont be able to rely on them.You need to have a layered approach. There needs to be multiple strategies of conveying the information. Using cards can be just one of many strategies to help make your game usable. Another way to look at it is if the game is already complete and in its final state is adding cards going to make it easy to play or harder. The answer in most cases is easier.,RPGdesign,cvvzweo,2,t5_31cnk

Id even ask the first at the beginning of a session allowing players to change once within if they realise this and the second at the end. The issue you will eventually find is one of scale so you need to decide this upfront. Personally Im a big fan of offering a choice between reliable but mediocre amp powerful with a cost. To be fair  even the first option could just have a cost of weak... But the other choice will need to be regarding its mechanical depth  otherwise it becomes very difficult to deal with by pure GM fiat and you open yourself up to abuse of trust.

5733968,0,t3_3t81qq,As has been stated several times a single bar for sanity is kind of silly and doesnt give much of an indication of how it affects someone. A few different types of sanity makes more sense with each having separate effects. You dont want a lot of them or it gets too complex but since sanity shouldnt change often and will tend to be a big deal when it does you can make it a little more complex than normal.So more than one sanity type. Id also suggest more than one type of sanity damage  hard sanity and soft sanity of a sorts. Soft sanity would basically be immediate shortterm effects such as poking someone until they go into a rage and smack you back or freezing in place unable to move when they see a monster. Its not lasting insanity it just affects that particular instance right that moment.A hard sanity loss would be something like severe mental or emotional trauma. Being forced to murder a loved one at gunpoint will screw most people up in the head pretty badly for a very long time same with things like being tortured or going through shell shock in war leading to PTSD. That kind of stuff doesnt go away overnight and will make it more easy for soft sanity to be depleted.Soooo what Id probably suggest there is having hard sanity loss lower the total maximum sanity and soft sanity loss increase the bar up until it hits the current total maximum and then you freak out somehow. If the hard loss drops the maximum to  or lower youre insane in that way permanently and the lower below  it is the more acute the problem is.So! Lets look at a quick way of showcasing this Aggression Terror Helplessness Disassociation Reality ObsessionThese six can more or less break down most kinds of insanity so lets cover each one and why they work.Aggression would be losing personal restraints against harming others. The individual becomes easily irritated perhaps even violent. They may dont have to be violent though but they may lose patience very easily over almost nothing.Terror would be fears of all kinds. The fear of being alone the fear of losing something precious the fear of dying that kind of stuff. Under intense enough terror someone would probably either freeze in spot or try to run away. Longterm insanity would be things like intense phobias.Helplessness is more vague than terror  its the belief that ones actions dont matter or dont affect the world. This can be represented in a number of ways from feeling like you couldnt do anything to stop a situation or becoming so disheartened that its hard to accept anything you do could have any consequence. Individuals who always shift the blame elsewhere may be suffering from a learned helplessness where they honestly believe it doesnt matter what harm they do to others its not their fault and they cant be held responsible for it because the gods made them do it or someone else forced them to or that their actions are incapable of harming someone else. This is pretty standard behaviour for most criminals and a disturbingly large portion of the college age young adults due to a variety of reasons.Disassociation is what happens when the mind flees entirely from a situation. Things are going so bad that it tries to distance itself. Things like disassociate disorders multiple personalities speaking to oneself in the third person talking to a sock puppet as though it were a real person and so on can help an individual to feel like its happening to someone else letting them cope with a problem. It can also make it difficult for them to accept that something needs to be done to fix an issue as their problems are continually held at arms length.Reality would be when someone has lost all touch with reality and no longer even remotely operates under the guise of whats going on. Hallucinations both aural and visual lack of capacity to understand cause and effect or the stereotypical crazy person who doesnt seem to have any idea of whats going on around them and rants and raves and such would be the lack of reality.Obsession would be when the individual becomes overtly fixated on something beyond healthy means and to extreme values. Something like Death the Kids symmetrical obsession in soul eater would be a good example where hell completely break down and be unable to focus on any task other than making sure everything is symmetrical. Someone who becomes overly fixated on anything would fall under this making overtly bad decisions or being incapable of making decisions at all.Now obviously this is simplified  we cant realistically condense the entirety of psychology into a game. The DSM is several hundred pages so... you wouldnt have a game youd have a medical manual. So to some degree things have to be boiled down to more simple characterizations.I think with the six listed however you could probably mix and match the various types to cover most kinds of insanity however.So yeah basically take a few key broad forms of insanity then list them as hard and soft values somehow and there you go. Just my thoughts on the matter anyway.,RPGdesign,cx7uryn,2,t5_31cnk
5760501,0,t3_3u0wtg,To be brutally honest Im not seeing anything that grips my interest in this system. Youve got a very specific and detailed setting in mind with a sort of dystopian magic world similar to Elysium. And then some generic mechanics that seem to have nothing to do with the setting and dont give me any indication of the sorts of adventures I might have with them except that I can presume Ill take damage a lot and dealing damage will be important. What sorts of adventures should players have in your setting? Are they mages controlling the masses through brute force fear and subversion? Are they the underdogs fighting the system and attempting to take down the ruling class? Are they just trying to get ahead in a punishing world where mages hold all the opportunity and everything comes at a cost? Please dont answer with They can have any adventure they can imagine! gtlt,RPGdesign,cxb56za,1,t5_31cnk
5805652,0,t3_3u5rd7,This is similar to what I am contemplating myself in my never ending project to develop my own system.I like somewhat abstracted systems. Detail is fine and consistency is important but it doesnt matter to me if its all accurate as much as if it feels accurate enough and works well in the story you are telling with your game. The mechanics can be pretty simple and still work but I like just enough complexity to make the system force players into choices.I would go with an Armour absorbs damage system. So a given weapon does X amount of damage and the armour it hits absorbs Y points of that damage. If YgtX then no damage occurs if XgtY then XY  Damage inflicted. Furthermore I would give armour its own hit points. Every time damage gets through the armour takes a box of damage. It can be repaired to get those boxes back but if it reaches zero then you need new armour. I am trying to create my own system so that it doesnt have HP per se what it has is injury levels for the major body areas Head Torso R Arm L Arm Legs with each injury level adding negative modifiers to taking various actions serious wound to the legs you dont move so fast etc. Not to say we dont have something like HPs for each area but that they are values used to determine the level of an injury not values that change i.e. Arm has  pts if you take less than  pts is a flesh wound  pts its a minor injury  its a major injury  a lethal injury etc. If your arm has  points then those values might be gt    etc. That way you are not having to track how many points you lost and you are not just fine right until you lose the last point then you keel over.So I have been looking at  types of basic combat damage Slash Crush and Pierce. Each melee weapon does one of these types. Ranged weapons typically do Piercing damage which is doubled. So if I shoot someone and score a hit doing say  pts damage their  point armour reduces that to  points. But piercing does double damage so that becomes  points. That might mean a minor injury to most targets. It can get more complex from there with head hits causing stun etc. As well you need to allow for burn damage acid and other odd types.With an SF setting you might introduce energy shields like you mentioned. I would make them absorb X damage as well same system but perhaps only from Energy weapons. I would make civilian police and military levels of energy shields. So a player needs to decide what level of commercial shield they can use or if they want to use a superior system but be in violation of the law assuming they are not police or military. Energy shields would have some sort of a battery life and perhaps be vulnerable to losing power after so long in combat unless you charge them. Higher quality ones would have better battery life. Perhaps they are only good for absorbing so many individual hits or so many points of hits and then need recharging.You might have physical armour that is oriented towards energy weapons as well to be used in conjunction with a Shield. Ablative armour that decreases energy damage but is pretty useless against a melee weapon like a stiletto Kevlar style armour for dealing with slug throwing weapons armour for melee weapons that is useless against energy or slug weapons but great against an edged attack etc. So the players have to choose what they want to wear or be vulnerable to. Each type of armour should apply some hits to your endurance agility or mobility so that if you equip yourself with everything you walk around like the Michelin man and perform very poorly when taking an action. Perhaps your physical armour might absorb a fixed value  a Die roll of points so that its not consistent in its effectiveness.You have complete freedom as to how the tech works since you are talking about the far future. You might decide there are Disruptor weapons  which are affected by Energy Shields but which completely bypass physical armour for instance.  ,RPGdesign,cxgqv9k,1,t5_31cnk

Ive pretty much set aside tomorrow for researching all the sources people have recommended so Il add that to the list.And I also see what you mean about forcing players to take the honourable route and its certainly something I need to address. The idea with the Honour system in mind is not to force a player into playing a honour bound character but rather as an incentive for why people should act honourably. Acting dishonourably can give the player a short term advantage Stealing weapons poisoning wine or murdering the guard in his sleep which is still as viable an option as it would be in any other game.

6114381,0,t3_3zau8k,That looks like a good start.The only issue I can see on a quick skim of it has to do with Aptitudes. Players cant choose any that are linked with the weakest Trait even if that Trait is the same as another. So with Traits of  the player can only choose Aptitudes tied to the highest Trait...that seems to be a bit odd and certainly something Id change immediately were I to play the game.

6157835,0,t3_3zwkza,I somewhat see myself at the narrative end of trpgs and I usually want to have combat as short as possible essentially boiled down to the question How much resources do the players loose without having to spend most of the game time to answer this question.I like it when combat is incorporated into noncombat actions and is using an identical or at least comparable system. In the same vein I would want to there not being a combat system at all but a general action resolving system that covers combat social interaction and interaction with your surroundings.But to answer your follow up question How many additional rules do you feel a combat system really needs to have? As much rules you need to give  viable and hard choices a player can make per phase maybe? to influence the outcome of the combat. I know that sounds rather ambiguous but I think achieving design goals is more important than limiting the rules to a specific number.,RPGdesign,cypkynx,6,t5_31cnk

6224342,0,t3_40u2yi,The simpler your core mechanic is roll this die and add this number the easier it is to explain the game to new people. This can be important as people generally dont stick with rpgs just to roll dice. The good stuff is in other parts of the game  the faster you can get new people to those parts the better a first impression theyll have.Some games however go a little overboard with this and end up with systems that are unified but unable to handle many variations or granularity  oWoD is a good example here the setup was good for broadly defined actions but got overly complicated fast when detailed rules were called for  ie combat which often involved rolling three different large dice pools for every attack and then had multiple attacks on each turn. It got annoying.Unified is nice but if you go that route make sure you have a system that can handle the extreme uses your game might call for.,RPGdesign,cyx51uq,1,t5_31cnk
6257280,0,t3_41769g,The underlying premise of this post is that system quality is best reflected in its combat design.  A full service RPG should offer more conflict resolution than hack amp slash.The main advantage of lethal combat is that it makes the players think before they rush into a fight.  Nonlethal combat naturally leads to murder hobos.However this isnt specific to generic systems any system regardless of how closely it is tied to its fluff can go either way with its combat.I think my system has solved your question.  Its generic but I used fantasy as the design sandbox.HP is determined by class makeup at character creation.  Advancement is all about raising classes and skills thereby increasing damage potential and the ability to deflectreduce damage but HP dont generally change at all.  A zero level character is capable of killing a mighty hero with a knife in a single blow but its very unlikely.  It is possible on a double crit for an attack to deal more than x damage than the average character has in total.I wrote a program to help me balance combat out.  It created two base level characters with random stats and such assigned random weapons and armor and simulated a toetotoe slugfest.  The average combat duration was about  seconds sometimes one would drop dead after a hit or two other times it would go forever because neither could gain the upper hand.  With average HP of about  one fight ended with a double crit that dealt  damage.  Remember these were base characters with limited skills.I was running a playtest campaign years ago again fantasy and one of the players essentially made a brick.  I warned him he wouldnt have much fun and explained all the ways the rules discourage powergaming but he stuck to his concept.  Three sessions in he wanted to make a new character because his brick wasnt useful he now understood what I had explained before.  He had seen how much fun everyone else was having exploringexploiting the rest of the rules which are quite fluid and full of possibilities.Another time I ran a test session at GenCon none of the players knew the system at all.  Handed out the pregenerated characters equivalent to about  or  level in DampD gave an overview and jumped into the scenario.  The guy playing the magic user when he wasnt actively participating in the scene sat quietly studying the magic rules.  We got to the big bad fight and all the PCs are huddled sitting behind a big rock discussing how theyre gong to storm the barn.  That goes on for a few minutes until the MU player looks up from the rules and says everyone huddle around me.  He then proceeds to cast and area effect spell that effectively doubled the damage of every weapon in the huddle.  As GM I thought aw shit but as the designer I let him do it because he releaved a flaw in the rules as they were written.  The party bum rushed the barn and slaughtered the big bad and all her minions though there was a hilarious crit involving the dwarf priests holy tankard spewing goats milk directly into a very lactoseintolerant lizardmans mouth.But I digress.Any system will attract specific types of players.  The main issues with generic systems have to do with fluff not mechanics per se. A generic system has no setting to accompany it which many players and GMs have come to expect many are attracted to fluff.  This isnt a failure just an extra burden to overcome. A generic system implicitly claims the ability to accomodate the flavor in any fluff but more often than not design decisions are made that cause the claim to be less than completely true.,RPGdesign,cz0vuam,1,t5_31cnk

6597520,0,t1_d01pf4h,Thanks! I will definitely check out your game on the wiki.Time period is a mishmash. Tang culture with Song tech would basically be the best approximation with some elements stolen forward and backward in time if theyre cool enough to warrant it. What Im trying to do is set a baseline for normal conflict between characters who havent trained in specific kung fu arts. Im really trying to create an environment where  the Art of War as understood by soldiers and  martial artskung fu as practiced by monks can exist in the same space. I guess right now Im trying to set up a normal set of combat rules. One of the appeals of getting your crazy qienhanced kungfu powers will be the ability to bendbreak these rules.  The conventional soldiers will have access to more weaponarmor types and some tactical abilities. They also can effectively lead units of hired NPC henchmen. Kung fu practitioners will be more squishy and less damagedealing but have greater mobility be harder to hit and have more variety in their powers. Thats what Im going for anyway.For example while most characters would only be able to Change Range from Standoff to Melee in one turn a kung fu practitioner might be able to expend some Qi and try to jump directly from Standoff to Close Quarters in one shot. In short these rules will generally apply to nonkungfu characters who are living in the Matrix. A character who studies a little kung fu multiclassing will find some flexibility. The specialist highlevel kungfu monk is like Neo without the plot armor. I think CQ as a Zone state is really more what Im looking at. I dont really play with grids and detailed battle maps so these are more mental distinctions at this point. Basically on a battle grid there would only be two states Ranged different squares and Engaged same square. Inside the Engaged state there are the three StandOffMeleeCQ zones. Another perhaps better thought would be to leave the modifiers alone and maybe grant extra attacks if one character has an advantage over another? For example lets say Bao has his spear and Lei has his sword. They start off at StandOff range so Bao has the advantage. As long as they stay at this range Bao gets  attacksturn and Lei only gets one. If Lei gets to melee range now Bao gets  attacksturn and Lei only gets . If Lei and Bao both have swords and are both fighting Melee nobody has advantage so they both only get  attackturn. If Lei is in Close Quarters with a dagger and Bao is still stuck with his spear now Lei has double advantage so he gets  attacksturn while Bao only gets . This would help the dagger feel deadly in CQ even if it does less damage per hit. It also makes sense that if were in CQ you have a knife and Im carrying a bigass pole youre probably going to be able to launch more attacks on me in a tensecond period than I will on you.On the opposite side if were in StandOff and I have the spear and you have the knife I get  attacks on you for every  attack you get on me. This also makes sense because youre gonna spend so much time trying to maneuver around for the right angle that I can stab at you a bunch and theres not much you can do about it.Its also less mathy since youre just counting attacksturn. It doesnt affect the effectiveness of a given attack which is kind of demoralizing for the player. Instead it gives bonus attacks to the player who is tactically winning. Also more attacks means more damage per turn which means shorter combats. Im also worried about how this will affect player behavior I dont want it to turn into Dancing n Dragons as everyone spends the whole time maneuvering for position.Hm. What do you think? Granting extra attacks to the tactical winner maybe sounds more fun than imposing penalties on the tactical loser. Thanks for responding!,RPGdesign,d01qk8s,3,t5_31cnk

6621855,0,t1_d047oi0,Eh different strokes for different folks. To argue my side why does Vader use I am your father while pressuring Luke to come to the Dark Side? Does family heritage have anything to do with the cosmic battle of the Force? No. Hes trying to alter the emotional chessboard. He throws Lukes thinking off balance by revealing a painful piece of information at a strategic time thinking that Luke will be overwhelmed by emotion think less clearly and capitulate. Does it work? Kind of. Vader succeeds in stirring Lukes emotions Luke is definitely distraught. In the end though hes not railroaded into joining the dark side but still does something pretty irrational and emotional he jumps into the abyss because he cant deal with the situation anymore. If he didnt have so much plot armor we would label it a suicide attempt.  So in this example Vader has successfully changed Lukes emotional state which has an effect on Lukes behavior. Luke is no longer able to react rationally to the situation. But that doesnt mean hes going to automatically do what Vader wants he can do a wide range of things in response to finding out who his daddy is but theyre all tinged by his feeling of shock and distress. Im still just confused about what the consequence would be in this case. What is the consequence of Lukes refusal? And how does the GM enforce such a consequence without railroading fiat? This whole mechanic just seems kind of mysterious to me.I guess as a player Id rather be told you still have control of your character but their thinking isnt rational and is being impaired by an emotion outside of their control  how will this play out? than your character has lost this pointbased mind game so now they must either comply go crazycatatonic or refuse and be cursed with some consequence that I as GM will make up as its not clearly defined. ,RPGdesign,d0499eh,1,t5_31cnk

Using a d means each  equals to a  change and using a d means each   equals a  change.Also if you want to increase player investment why not instead of having a manageable resource like your stamina use your  and  to create but... moments? For example the player roll a difficulty  check. If he suceed in the first  rolls but fails by one or two the last one he may choose after rolling the dice to suceed anyway but will give the GM or a opposing player the option to insert a complication in the action or even in a later scene. In the same way a player could choose to fail at his last roll even after suceeding in the dice roll to create a no but moment favorable to his character.,RPGdesign,d0960qh,2,t5_31cnk
6678023,0,t1_d07ixez,Sorry it took me so long to respond busy weekend.I appreciate the interest but unfortunately no open doc right now. Like I said I have an abundance of feedback from playtesting on a weekly basis so read only feedback can only do me so much good. I plan on saving Internet only feedback for things like readability and though we have quite a bit done Im a hard core perfectionist the reason weve taken  years is because Ive thrown out like multiple damage systems because though they worked fine they did not meet my expectations. Most of the hard work is done but Id like to go a bit farther before a release. For example we had a rather interesting test just last night where I wanted to stress test the anatomy system to be sure combat met my depth speed and complexity requirements so the players controlled a scorpionman a giant a fairy and a giant squid and fought again the DM controlling  zombies and a giant blob. Biggest find was actually that I should create a format for natural weapons to ease monster creation just a bit and some minor grapple language when the blob and its zombie minions tried to absorb the giant through an acidic grapple. The grapple mechanics worked great as usual but there was ambiguity in the rules language over wether the giant could overcome the  zombies hanging on him and disrupting his attack at once or separately. Happy to say it overall went very well though rounds were still fast about  minutes for a full round the players needed little explanation and I dare anyone to design a better giant squid experience haha. Anyway blah blah blah design stuff only I am enthused about. Point being these are things Im only gonna find in extensive playtest readability feedback can wait.I guess thats underwhelming considering I was talking about how important design can be but without a document to show off and back it up. If youre really curious I can answer questions about specifics I can say Ive thrown out a lot of typical RPG conventions but needs more and more testing before its ready for the wild. Like I said appreciate the interest though.  ,RPGdesign,d0a2dv7,1,t5_31cnk

6821655,0,t1_d0pivx0,I guess Yuanfen refers to the process of finding new NPC relationships which is partially up to fatenot under the control of people thus the dice roll to represent the whims of the cosmos. Its true that I dont necessarily need to use that word though since youre right in that theres no strong cultural association between Mianzi and Yuanfen.  In the game there are specific skills for Persuasion and Deception so I guess saying Charisma check was too lazy a term to use. Theyd have to roll PersuasionDeception etc. successfully in order to avoid losing Face in that context. These skills are influenced by the Charisma stat though. Do you really think leaving Face points up to the GM would be that controversial? Assuming your GM isnt a jerk it actually brokers the power between players and the GM a bit players now have the ability to basically will a useful NPC into existence. Thing is social interactions are so fluid that Im not sure how you can get around GM fiat in terms of awardingtaking away Face points. Since the GM essentially creates the game world and the communities in which the characters operate what else can actually monitor whether or not PCs are living up to those obligations? I cant really think of any other way to do it mechanically. Considering the GM usually has total control over NPC creation I figured that limiting GM power to Face point distribution would actually give more power to the players.

7182042,0,t1_d1uij3s,I thought about using damage type for armor but I think I may be able to get around it if I stick with damage types. So basically armor will reduce any type of damage but piercing and bludgeoning damage can just have a static bonus that acts as piercing while slashing weapons may deal lots of damage but the damage dealt is more random with no static bonus. Itll make damage typebased armor redundant since damage is already reduced based on the damage type which is exactly what we want!I personally dont take issue with multiple damage types since it should just be a matter of grabbing a different set of dice although it may cause more clutter on the character sheet. It will cause more decision making but the decision is important do I want to risk breaking my weapon by thrusting or play it safe and slash at my opponent.

This made a great twist on standard money approach where players actually enjoyed the benefits of it without actually ever counting and marking money on their sheet...But thats also what bugs me about BoL  its a bit too far in freeform.

Youve made a justification for players to tell whos a native and who is not at a glance. Or if you want to be more specific then be more specific. Just be neutralavoid implying racial features are ugly and avoid fetishizing them as well. If it makes you nervous try to ask a person of the race youre describing to critique it. Protip avoid using red and yellow in describing skin color. Both of those are used as racialslurs today. Black was once used as a slur but I think thats been pretty much reclaimed today. ,RPGdesign,d3d5ntr,5,t5_31cnk
7692157,0,t3_4kodyw,An idea I had for a game set in an MMOThe tank has a soak radius. All attacks on allies within that radius deal damage to the tank. All other effects harm the target. Of course this is very gameynot so good outside a MMO setting. Another idea that I am using in a different game declared opposition. When someone the performer declares an action anybody the opposition can declare an reaction that that action creating a check. Now the opposition is usually going to be the target of the action but not always. Anyone can oppose. This means that the beefy tank can oppose attacks for his weaker friends so long as his opposition is possible hes not too far away incapacitated etc. Now the tank is not actually drawing attacks or damage from the enemy. However he is incentivising the enemy to get rid of him first. So long as hes around everybody near him has his opposition strength. If he were gone the group will be easier to harm. ,RPGdesign,d3gjrt5,3,t5_31cnk

Your list covers at least  of them in some way.  Standalone verbs are very narrow communicate compel detect morph resist summon etc.  In paired words the verbs are mostly math related they adjust a number on the character sheet affect nonnumbers create things or target a thing the noun part limits scope.  A few words are reversible createdestroy and several have different distinct modes.Its also important to break up spell abilities so that spellcasters cant learn one new thing and suddenly gain a myriad of new abilities.

Its kind of hard to read that shorthand.But yes critics success if you got for example an  on a die with a d pool and the other two dice succeed then youd crit. I got the idea from another system I think storyteller ?.Im still working out the target numbers. I was thinking an easy TN might be  so that a player with a d attribute could still make it if theyve invested in the right skills. i kind of figured a d attribute would be the characters dump stat so Im not sure if Id bother trying to accommodate much for an attribute that lowthe different odds of critting wasnt intentional. Im still working on the design so I guess that hadnt occurred to me. I suppose its unlike for someone with a d attribute to crit hit since the way I have things atm you have to succeed your dice rolls with ds for that to happenlet me know if you think theres a better way to do this. Im pretty green with this design stuff.,RPGdesign,d4ecg28,1,t5_31cnk
8011522,0,t1_d4fjwfq,Using the skillatt to decide the number of aspects you can invoke does sound like a thematically fitting way of testing but Im concerned that interpreting the chosen dice in this test would take quite a bit of time. It would take play testing to see if it fits the style you want.I also think the dice pool size being set by the skill level is interesting but if you didnt have the skill then what do you roll? This is why some systems use the attribute to determine the pool size. This is especially true if you are trying to cap your dice pools the more things to add into that dice pool limit advancement in attributes and skills.I think the critical values  and  are not a problem in terms of representing both sources of power. Honestly most people may have a minor issue with the specific number but in the end its your game and most people will give you the benefit of the doubt and move on. The issue that I see is having these values make sense for the test as they are at opposites ends of the range. I would be tempted to use a failure  partial success  and success  for demons but  failure  partial success and  success for angels. Both count their successes this would not give an advantage to angel or demon operating on trying to get different triples. If you had more successes that counts as a success more partial successes then it is successful but comes with a complication or if more failures then the test fails. This could also allow for a use of skill points the appropriate skill allows a player to improve their result by  for each point in that skill improving for a demon means adding  and for an angel means removing .It may be a minor quibble but Ive considered using a d before as well and they are just not common enough in dice bags people tend to have an ample supply of ds and probably ds and a few complete sets of polyhedrals.All that being said I am concerned about the original posted rule about having to take the critical failure if it is rolled. Based on this the probability of rolling a critical failure increases by getting higher dice pools. Of course the chance of critical success increases as well but it would suck rolling three s and three s and instead of critically succeeding I critically fail.,RPGdesign,d4gking,1,t5_31cnk

8167423,0,t1_d4ybvod,Thanks! Ive updated the original post with more specific details on the mechanics and the kind of costs you might suffer when you screw it up. Do let me know if that changes your mind!Heres a copy pastagt So heres the mechanics  You roll a d dice pool and pick  result and add  to  modifiers to it depending on the situation and if you have any specialized casting abilities.gt  Low Tier  roll d keep  score Medium Tier  roll d keep  score High Tier  roll d keep  scoregt If you rolled  or below you fail and must pay a price. If you rolled    you succeed with cost. If you rolled more than  you succeed without cost so to avoid the cost you must have at least  modifier.gt Cost  Take taint equal to   number of dice you rolled min  max . The higher the taint the easier it is for supernatural horrors to find and attack you and the more uneasy people will feel around you giving you massive disadvantages in social situations. In addition the GM picks  more consequences from this listgt  Take damage equal to your taint bypassing armour The spell also affects yourself if applicable Choose a body part it is horrifically scarred permanently no mechanical effect You immediately age a number of years equal to your taint not much mechanical effectgt One note healing is nonmagical and it takes a long time to heal. For instance you can only heal  taint per game session and only heal  HP per rest so its pretty severe to take damage in any way.,RPGdesign,d4yh747,1,t5_31cnk
8229421,0,t3_4s2u8s,In STORYBOARD I break skills into two values  ability and risk. Ability is the numerical value that determines how good you are. Risk is the number of dF you roll when using that skill. Its swingy enough to encourage players having a high risk skill but because dF can produce either a positive or negative outcome its selflimiting enough that players wont want to use high risk skills all the time.This is pertinent to difficulty because it allows players to assess their skills in a situation with a known difficulty and then determine how risky they want to be in return. Do they want to play it safe and go with a high ability low risk skill or do they go all out and go with a high risk skill knowing that they may end up worse off? ,RPGdesign,d568fs1,2,t5_31cnk

Is it a setting topic that draws me in? Perfect example Blades in the Dark. To me that was Almost a sell based on setting concept Before I looked at the mechanics. However you have to get the setting across quickly and concisely. I like others wont read a Novel to figure out what the setting is about.

An arrow cant come close to the sound barrier but bullets can.  Bullets use this to their advantage much more kinetic energy on a smaller arguably lighter but much more dense projectile than an arrow.Then you get into machine guns and the only way to kind of balance those is scatter.But as uAsmor said this is all very simulationist... its up to you how accurate you want to be.,RPGdesign,d6lmqgc,1,t5_31cnk
8659905,0,t3_4yif0s,Well I do handle it quite differentlyFirst of all the differences between powerlevels in my game are quite small. The greatest benefit of being a higher level is that you can do stuff for a longer time because you have access to more resources. But anyone can contribute in a meaningful way regardless of level.Secondly I dont have GM fiat exp like you RPd well or that was a good idea but the players are the ones to choose by engaging with the mechanics of the system. Of these mechanics some include we as a group achieved this which result into group exp and some others include I as a single character choose to spend more resources which result into exp for that character.The next way I deal with this is by having greatly rising exp cost for the succeeding levels. For an advancement in my game you have to pay exp equal to your number of advancements plus the cost of the advancement itself. So a starting character could buy  advances whereas a character that already has  advances could only buy  advance with the same amount of exp.On a side note from my point of view exp should be awarded directly or indirectly only for playing the game as intended.,RPGdesign,d6o3rcy,1,t5_31cnk

This is also the maximum it may have in the pool. The fastest character regenerates a die every  ticks. A . times slower character will get a die every  ticks. a . times slower character will get a die every  ticks and so on. A character with at least  die in its pool may act but an action with more dice is far better.

8956487,0,t3_52xrn6,I like the idea. In a mythic setting like you seem to have I would expect magical or magical feats out of every character once they become sufficiently heroic. This certainly sounds like it would accomplish it.The potential downsides I see as youve presented it so far are Youve only got  skills and if only some of those grant occult power powerful magicians may end up with fairly uniform skill sets. Then again this may be a feature surely the study of the land the stars and the human body are all essential for any selfrespecting magician. Putting overt spells at Occult  would make those an endgame ability for dedicated sorcerers. No doubt you were just throwing out numbers I think I would put overt spells at Occult  or even  so that its possible to have characters who are supernaturally heroic only in one or two areas like the woodsman who can literally vanish in the woods.

It will clearly contain manoeuvres hit locations etc. I agree with you that this is not the focus of this question. Higher numbers allow higher resolution which in turn allows a greater diversity of gameaffecting attributes such as strength  toughness  etc.. One other important and fairly unique aspect of this system is that it should allow huge differences between combat participants for example it should be possible to run a combat between a giant and a dwarf in a realistic fashion. Thats why the attributes are on logarithmic scale from infinity to infinity.

So instead of putting  for height you might put towering broad as a mountain for build.  Im sure there are other games that do that but coming from a group that mainly plays various flavors of DnD it was really interesting to see.One idea about starships that occurred to me while reading your post is that the games Ive played that have them mainly various Star Wars TTRPGs dont have very good rules or guidelines for using them narratively.  Vehicles are as much a source of complication in Star Wars as they are a well vehicle.   out of  movies that feature the Millennium Falcon have sub plots or at least brief gags about how the ship is barely holding together.  And a major hiccup in The Phantom Menace is a problem with a ships engine.  So a cool mechanic for a Star Wars game could be some sort of random ship maintenance subplot generator.  It might even work well with a system somewhat like obligation in Edge of the Empire where theres a random chance each adventure of the ship breaking down in some fashion or the ship otherwise offering a complication to the plot maybe it was stolen and its original owners have tracked it down or its previous owner had a big price on their head and now a bounty hunter is after the party.Character advancement is something I have weird feelings about.  While I do like the idea of advancement being tied to individual character agency Im also very wary of systems with asymmetric advancement.  This mainly comes from experience playing DnD campaigns were the group voted on one or two players for best RP for a small amount of bonus experience.  This resulted in the same two players getting it most sessions and winding up a level or two higher than everyone else.  It never really bothered anyone in those groups but something about it soured me on the idea.It might work much better in a game with more horizontal advancement or even in a game where the general power of a character remains somewhat static and advancement always comes with a commensurate loss somewhere else. ,RPGdesign,d871hgi,1,t5_31cnk

No you have just as hard a time targeting him as if you were trying to throw a rock at him but assuming your Spell Targeting skill is better than you Rock Throwing skill.As for successes it refers to systems that use a dice pool system. Roll X dice and count how many succeed. Then the number of successes determines the level of success.  This is the classic system from a lot of games but most highly notable would probably be Shadowrun World of Darkness Burning Wheel etc.  If you arent familiar with them you really should at least find one core book of those systems many are in pdf free via quick starts etc. and read over how they work or read up online by doing a Google search on Dice Mechanics.

A single dagger thrust can kill you so why shouldnt a single spell be able to?  All attacks are instant death effects.So there are several questions that need to be answered first before you deal with instant death effects  What system does the game use to prevent instant death?Why is it beneficial to have instant death not happen?Do you feel it necessary to have situations that do not follow the above reasoning?Does this particular effect fit into one of those situations?If you add rules to prevent assassinations then create a different way of assassinating you have ruined your original purpose.  All youve managed to do is change how assassinations are done.If you want to make combat more strategic by making sure there is a chance to retreat if things go poorly.

Does some stacking penalty for chaining actions get reset? What is the actual benefit to stopping early?gtWhat are your thoughts?Seems to be a similar mechanical result to if the PbtA games like Dungeon World cut out the partial success result.  For the most part full success has no consequences for example in melee combat if you roll a full success the opponent cannot make a move it is abstracted as you fight for a while and only you get a good hit in.  So if you roll  full successes you get  hits and the opponent doesnt do anything of substance. Conversely if you fail the roll you do nothing of substance and the opponent acts.However you have designed your system with this chaining in mind whereas in PbtA it is deliberately quite uncommon since the average roll is normally the partial success.,RPGdesign,d8vbj6f,1,t5_31cnk

Concerning your sales pitch  I have my problem with it.  That might be my mind though.  The term middleware is not really that broadly knownis it?  I do not know between what it is in the middle. In the informatic it is something that connects two systems with each other but is it that?  What I get from your pitch is that you provide rulesets for things that many RPGs do not have rules for.

9498139,0,t3_5asips,Theres way too much going on in even just your basic mechanic for the average gamer to ever bother trying to learn your game. If you really want to make colours important to your basic mechanic then just focus on colours. Dont also use unusual dice D and make players add up multiple dice and take account of advantages of different colours and pay attention to crits and double crits and botches and double botches etc. Theres just way too much going on there for me as a player to understand what the hell I should be doing or to work out what is my best play etc.Id recommend going back to the drawing board entirely and building the game entirely from the ground up with colours at the heart if theyre that important to you. Here are two suggestions on how to do that Have custom dice of different colours with unusual and different distributions. You could use nontransitive dice for this which is an idea Ive been working with for a while so that green has an advantage over green but white has an advantage over red etc. Maybe each character has one colour theyre strong in roll one more die and one theyre weak in roll one less die and players roll a default of  dice in the appropriate colour for their action and add them together. An unopposed check is just rolled against the GM representing the obstacle environment random luck etc. Special abilities might allow you to swap out one colour for another under certain circumstances or allow you to roll a bonus die of any colour your choice on certain checks etc. This means that your rulebookcharacter sheet is going to be full of stuff like Whenever Elves are required to roll blue they may roll green instead and This spell allows you to roll a bonus black die on any black action taken in the next  rounds and so on. Colours feel really central to the game and most of the rules dont require math and criticals and stuff just changing colours and using more or fewer dice. Alternatively get rid of dice altogether and just use counterstokens of different colours. You can then make the game less luckbased and more strategic. Maybe the basic resolution mechanic involves putting a certain number of coloured glass beads in your closed fist and holding it over the table. The GM or other player does the same and then you both turn your hand over when youre both ready. The colours cancel each other out in some way so that the result is determined by the interaction between your choice and your opponents choice both of which were secret so there can be bluffing involved etc. Then special abilities and bonuses can give you extra beads or allow you to swap out any one bead after the reveal for another of your choice or add a bead of a certain colour after the reveal if you wish etc. This gets rid of the maths pretty much entirely and replaces it with a more pokerstyle minigame for resolution. Once again colours are really really centralthe core of the game.,RPGdesign,d9juj4h,2,t5_31cnk

Its a way to referee a game in a fair manner that lets the players play within the same framework and expect fair if not equal outcomes. Using dice and numbers stems from war games and board games where these were used as randomisers and stats to determine outcome. It is not the numbers that are the backbone of the RPG. They are like the dice or whathaveyou only an interface through which play happens. The framework that dictates the numbers function and form is what really matters here.

Amazing to have some examples to work off of  will definitely give these a look thank you!The plan for the game would be that there are two types of spells you can use old spells class spells these are earned by level  and serve as the main basis for combatexploration and crafted spells new magic created by a new generation of witches.The dice are more like a competency checkwildcard element.So example scenario Thats definitely more in line with Charmed A demon has been targeting certain types of young women  blonde aged between  and  luring them with the promise of a luxury life and holding them in a mansion. When they hit  though he drains the remaining life out of them to elongate his own and finds new victims.In an effort to hunt the demon down the group would write a spell decide what they wanted it to do and then based on their roll the GM decides the outcome. So perfect roll  The location of the demon is revealed to them Partial roll  One of them gets transformed in to the type of girl that the demon is talking physical and psychological effect effected player cant cast until the demon has been stopped and subsequently becomes bait Fail  The spell has the opposite effect and the demon becomes aware that hes being hunted.It kind of serves a twofold purpose one to show that theres a definite potential cost to using these abilities two to make it feel more like these are witches that arent experts.But it still opens up the potential possibility of players creating their own spells that have direct consequences for other players that they may not be Ok with.

9734784,0,t1_dad0n4v,gt I focus much more heavily on momentumMomentum and energy have a very close relationship PMV vs . EMV . Theyre not interchangeable but increases in one are also increases in the other. I bring up energy though because thats what goes into shredding tissues and doing damage. Energy not momentum. But by transferring momentum from the bullet to the body we also transfer energy.Penetration depth is not the important factor the key factor to how much damage a bullet does is how much energy it can transfer to your body. A lowcaliber jacketed rifleround carries much more kinetic energy than a lowvelocity pistol round but depending on the strike it may actually transfer far less kinetic energy it does a through and through.The ideal case for any round if were talking about lethality is to not exit the body at all. Its to transfer  of its kinetic energy into the body. Thats why we have things like hollow points they reduce the overall mass of the round and significantly reduce its velocity but they increase the size of the contact patch allowing the bullet to more efficiently transfer its energy into the body.Ive been around guns but honestly Im more of a physics hobbyist.,RPGdesign,dad0vxq,2,t5_31cnk

In your specific case weve had the talk before that you maybe need to deal with the imaginative kid factor... so you have some potentially justifiable need for rules which allow a large and flexible range of character types.    I will say however that Ive seen quite a few optional race rules where it feels really tacked on... and even worse they functioned by essentially having the player replace normal character creation optionschoices with you are type X nonhuman. Long overlyenthused rant follows so let me begin by saying I think your current optional rule does it the Right Way. You add a choice rather than making player have to for example pick being an elf over being a cleric.    With replacement mechanics nonhuman characters are less fleshed out and were classifying entire groups of people thru broad inflexible stereotypes or stuff like characterizing the state of being a dwarfelfetc along the same lines as being a fighterwizardbasketweaver... all of which frankly kinda borders on what one could call racist. Obviously not realworld topicallyfocused modernday context racism But still classic definition racism.

Take the low combat sneak example and imagine how the game changes if instead of gaining experience or being completely static the character slowly retrains and regularly gives up a bit of stealth skill to gain combat ability.Another option is Resources of various kinds. Say you have a villain and the party understand they cant defeat him at the moment and that they wont just go grind level ups until they can. Instead you get stories about finding mythical artefacts that can change the fight gaining renown to convince notable NPCs to take your side learning about the villain and preparing counters for his abilities to avoid a fair fight and run an assassination or some combination of the above as you gain power unrelated to stats.

10402568,0,t1_dcmvmj5,This is great advice on working backwards.  I was just today thinking of who the bad guy really would be since with social engineering most people are going to LOVE corporations and they will think they do it willingly.  Therefore who the characters are needs to be really examined and who they fight against needs to also be looked at.  I am hoping my military background will help with the action parts but the motivations still havent clicked with me yet.You really bring to the forefront that before I finish my social class mechanics I might need to hammer in these details so that the mechanics fit the theme and not the other way around.Thanks.,RPGdesign,dcn750y,2,t5_31cnk

10422107,0,t3_5p94n0,I understand your question but your post has a lot of unnecessary assumptions in it about how HP works that it makes it difficult to actually answer your question.Just because a game has HP doesnt mean you just roll dice and watch health bars deplete over time. And just because a game has something other than HP doesnt mean you have to somehow get underneath to hit its vulnerable belly or get on top of its head to shoot an arrow into its brain. Games can have exciting mechanics and fiction with or without HP.Having said that in The Way of the Earth there is no HP and no damage in a conventional sense. Successful attacks impose risk on targets which increases the degree of success of future successful attacks used against them. Successful attacks also impose negative effects on the target depending on the attacks degree of success like cornering the target disarming the target knocking the target back or down weakening the target and misdirecting the target. With a high enough degree of success either from a supremely excellent roll or enough accumulated risk attacks kill characters outright.So the first round of combat is all about imposing these interesting effects on each other while risk begins to build. The second round is all about risk getting to dangerous levels and more permanent harm setting in. Then the third round is all about risk getting unmanageably high and characters dying off as a result.,RPGdesign,dcpeybc,10,t5_31cnk

A core mechanic explained in text would require much more as a flowchart.Flowcharts expose and tend to equalize every detail and often lead to a perceived exaggeration of complexity.Reading text achieves the highest comprehension and retention rates of any presentation method.

Except mine has  as a jam no matter what.  The other ranges move around in range depending on the weapon and its condition so an automatic weapon may have a larger range to fail where but it would be more spread out where a sniper might just have a consecutive range to fail it kind of makes me think of the timed reloads in gears of war.  Also realize ill be referencing videogame mechaincs more than boardgames because Ive played more videogames than boardgames and the idea of this is to translate a game to a tabletop RPG.  Anyways the failures dont cause damage in a numerical sense more like a  successfailure kind of deal.  So for example  jams might equal a decrease in condition,RPGdesign,dd6bjd0,1,t5_31cnk
10594393,0,t3_5rll1l,Tales of Nomon my game in development has a similar system to the one you described. Im not going to try to make your system like mine but I want to provide some insights Ive discovered in development. A single d regardless of explosions allows checks to become trivial. I do think that luck in your system is underemphasized but I dont think increasing the die size is a solution. As is many checks may become infallible at higher levels. This can be good but generally detracts from drama and realism. The exploding die does give a weaker opponent a chance to succeed on contested checks but that chance is dismalthey have a  chance of getting a bonus  to  bonus ignoring further explosions which are even less likely. You might consider tying your nouns verbs andor equipment to a dice pool. Im not a big fan of dice pools especially large ones but they are very useful for providing an increasingly small chance of failure. Exploding dice are normally used with dice pools because the more dice you roll the more likely one may explode. If you dont want to use a dice pool you could move to a smaller die though doing so will end up deemphasizing luck even more and not really make explosions more likely.  I think your equipment mods are fine. Giving bonuses for specificity is something I considered in my game but ultimately rejected. My issue was twofold. First it gave the GM more powers of interpretation. This meant that checks gained an extra stage for GM review slowing things down and giving the GM more power than I wanted them to have in my system. The second reason I rejected it was due to scale. Many skills could be considered narrower than others but how narrow are they? Both London and Bread Street are narrower than England but they both get the same narrowness bonus. I started to make guidelines for how narrow things could be compared to each other but I threw that out for being too cumbersome. Ultimately I decided to allow my players to select broad abilities as much as they like. England is simply more useful than London in my game. Players are told as such and are also told that they are in charge of their own difficulty levelchoose your skills as you please and interpret them however you please. The rules and the GM do not care. Of course my end result may not jive with your system. They are natural results of my games philosophy but they are admittedly unrealistic. ,RPGdesign,dd8qa4w,2,t5_31cnk

10607373,0,t3_5rsxns,I cant really think of a broad skill thats not already mentioned already see Do Anything. It is the broadest skill possible as far as I can see. And about as boring as it gets. Being very fond of Fate Accelerated and how it opperates I dont see a problem with do anything skillsabilities  which is effectively what its Approaches are  as long as they bring flavour to the action.Based on that opinion my answer to the followup questions are as follows The smallest number of skills necesary to encompas all possible player actions are two one flavourful and powerful skill that can be however broad as it wants as long as it inspires the player to use it and then one weaker skill that covers everything else. The broadest most useless skill I can think of is Killing All The Things becaus the game is all about researching alchemy magic and avoiding religious authoritory that wants to shut it down. Oh or it is Moving Like a Shadow becaus the game is all about heavymetal badasses fighting a planets worth of murderbots. It all depends on what the game is all about really. The advantages of a predefined skill list is just the thing you see in the last point  it makes skills fit the game you are playing. If its about subterfuge and sorcery thats what the skill list should be if its all about heavymetal robot recycling thats what the skill list should reflect.

If you are making a competitive game about an alternate history then realism is king right?Sure roie play can override the design. But even in those cases the design can influence or even occasionally override the original roleplay ideas that players have.Think about how different DampD E and DampD E are.

I work in design research on tech products and similar things happen. One strategy is to do a full bythebook test with little criticism in the moment. Make it clear that youre not looking for suggestions at this stage but instead do a debrief at the end. Players could write notes on how theyre feeling at various stages then compare afterwards. Other play testers do more experimental playing where they actively try to vary rules in the moment to try and discover design elements they wouldnt have thought of by themselves. Also take every individual opinion with a grain of salt. Youre looking for patterns between multiple players feedback to maximize your goals.

11215172,0,t1_df2qmj8,Racism is not admitting that biological differences exist between different races it is insisting that different races should be treated differently or given different opportunities based on those differences  be they perceived or even based in fact. The average cow has more physical strength than the averag broccoli. The average ox is stronger than the average cow. The average human is stronger than the average rabbit. The average neanderthal is stronger than the average human. The average man of Nordic heritage is stronger than the average Mbenga Pygmy. These statements are factual and there is no harm in acknowledging the differences between species race or cultures. The harm comes when one insists that another should be treated in a different way not for their individual capabilities but because of what they are thought of as a group. The fact that many of us get uncomfortable when a person makes a factual statement false or otherwise about differences in capabilites or aptitudes is because it feels like it is too close to taking the next step and implying that because of those differences they should be treated differently. And it is perfectly reasonable to be uncomfortable there that shows we are aware of the dangers in treating people differently on such a basis especially since we arent dealing with such clear cut examples. Bringing it back to RPGs  orcs are stronger than elves in the vast majority of examples. Thats pretty clear. Size and biology make a difference. They are more aggressive as well and often lack empathy to the same degree as other races  another feature of biology. If your game is taking a loose approach to simulationism then making that a statistic difference is not likely very important anymore than differentiating movement speeds between a  foot individual and a  foot individual. For a more simulationist game however you do yourself and your players a disservice by choosing to take a blind eye to what are often substantial differences. Plus orcs make the best Wizards.

11227381,0,t3_6019zu,This kind of thing comes up fairly often so lets go over this for a moment.First off before you even get to mechanical benefits anything you add to a game has to have a strong purpose and a reason for its existence. When it comes to playable races this means you need some major differences physiologically psychologically and culturally. If you dont have these things for each race then dont add the race because they arent distinctive enough to matter.Now from there you can start including how those things apply towards making the races behave mechanically. Note that mechanics dont get just tacked on but rather you have an idea of what distinguishes that race from other races and the mechanics are used to describe how those differences actually play out in a practical manner in terms of the game itself. Whatever you do dont just start tacking on random mechanics with no idea why youre doing so. If you just think it sounds neat or whatever? Not good enough.To do it this way ensures that no matter what you do your mechanics will make sense within the race and have a purpose of some sort. It also gives you a pretty good idea of which mechanics to make. If you point out that the race is very different from most because they have wings oh hey the mechanic is they can fly or glide. Easy right?In terms of what kinds of things should be placed in the game for races generally Id state avoid giving raw stat upgrades. You have other things that can perform that role much better already and a characters race heavily weighs upon how theyll think and act. Try to avoid giving mechanical advantages for having certain personalities if at all possible.That doesnt mean that you cant have stat increases linked to race but it probably shouldnt be a straight up like elves get  dex! because if you do that then anyone who plays a dexbased character is going to probably play the elf or equivalent. Thiss where you get really blatantly obvious stereotypes thatre kinda boring.Sooooo how do you get around that mess? The way I solved this issue was to give each race the ability to purchase upgrades to their innate mechanics. So lets say dragons are known for punching holes through walls  they specifically get bonuses for damaging terrain features. This can then be upgraded to a  strength bonus as part of the characters talents. They get  points total in this case to spend on their speciesbased upgrades and upgrading a stat costs . So... I have  stats in my game dragons have  potential ones they can pick from if they want to boost their stats and they can upgrade  out of those  at most. They also have a bunch of other more interesting stuff like flight as mentioned earlier augmenting their natural weapons like their fire breath or learning to use other variants on it hardening their scales putting their innate stubbornness to better use by making them resistant to mind control abilities that kinda thing. In this manner I wind up with the capacity for a dragon to realistically be stronger than a human but only if the dragon actually invests in such. Its that dragons are potentially stronger than humans if they work at it but by default you dont get a raw stat increase. Lots of species in my game can get a strength boost since every species has  out of the  stats that can be upgraded but no species automatically is stronger for realsies in terms of a raw str bonus.Now thats just one way to do it. Its the way I happen to personally favour myself but you can handle it in different ways. The point is you want to have differences in how your races are physically built and how they think and then how those convert into different cultural traditions. Once you know these things you just have to describe them is all and thats what your mechanics are. Try to stick to things that are nonstats if possible  the most interesting mechanics tend to be ones that let you do new stuff rather than just a stat boost which can only let you do something you can already do better. Wherever possible add new stuff new options new choices.As for the races you pick to use try to ensure that each has a distinctive niche that no other race fills. Each one should have a purpose in the game both culturally and mechanically. If you do that then your races will be interesting and with minimal overlap. Its okay if theres some overlap as long as each is different enough that they dont fall into the same overall category of what they do. If you have one race that likes to use brute force have another that enjoys finesse and one that enjoys to use stealth and trickery or to talk their way out of problems or one that likes magic for example. In the end each race should stand clearly and cleanly separate from any other but with wiggle room for individuals within the race to go against the grain. Thats personally a large part of why I like the upgradable features for races  you can have several characters of the same race and they dont need to step on each others toes as they can each be specialized in a different area of the several things that race is known for and that combination of stuff the race is known for helps to make it unique.Anyway that should give you something to work with.

11352374,0,t3_6208q5,Soooo agree. Back when we used to play DnD we almost always used duh initiative or whichever character made most sense to take action and in whichever order the players wanted. The only time players rolled was when there was some debate or contest to determine order. For NPCsmonsters I would often add a characters initiative modifier to  roll for the NPC and determine where they got a turn to act  or I would just narratively determine when the NPC acted. This ended up feeling similar to determining which of the players characters the monster was targeting  I know that can be something GMs roll for but most of the time GMs just pick whichever makes sense. If the barbarian is attacking two goblins it makes sense that the goblins would be attempting to return blows against the barbarian.

Adding to the initial dice is dependent on the TN usually between  and  so your looking at  or so.The idea I have is that increasing the accuracy or speed of the attack doesnt necessarily make it hit harder. You would then be choosing to spend dice on accuracy which also increases damage some or on guaranteed damage increase.I have also thought about having two different numbers which are independent Accuracy and Power. Accuracy only affects whether you hit where you intended. Power is the only one that affects damage. Im not sure if that is better though.Thanks for the input.,RPGdesign,dfnx8mm,2,t5_31cnk

11444384,0,t1_dft75ix,I think what the OP meant to say was instead of simply telling a designer that they are reinventing DND that we should make a conscious effort to ask whether or not they are aware of such a thing or if maybe that isnt even the case. Perhaps they havent drawn the same conclusion yet and if so they might benefit from a more experienced designer telling them about the perpetual broken assumptions theyre making. That should assuming both parties are able to think critically lead to either a the newly fledged designer catching on to your point and improving their design game or b them defending their stance based on their reason for basing their game well inside DampDs perimeter.Mind you I understand that it can be a hassle to repeat the same thing to other designers over and over again. I started dropping in here about a year ago and at that time I was stuck trying to build a system that had classes leveling basically everything DampD except the dice mechanic. I reckon at that time people read my design and dismissed it straight away because of that which I can understand. Since then Ive broadened my RPG horizon by reading more games but I did so not because someone told me to but because I noticed I wasnt getting any feedback on my original idea which admittedly wasnt very good . The point in me relating this story to you is simple. New designers could learn a lot faster if we were to tell them WHY they should consider alternate options besides the ones were familiar with. Ive been there. Ive come out the other end and now I design with a goal firmly in mind creating mechanics that suit what Im trying to do instead of inserting mechanics from other games I think might fit or are simply the only ones I know. One could wonder if the community as a whole wouldnt benefit from such an attitude.,RPGdesign,dft7let,6,t5_31cnk

11486717,0,t1_dfy05ni,Good call. So from here I have two ideas. Wearing having it equipped a sword of good make ads to your PresenceCharisma score.. Most people out in the field would be wearing armor so swords would be useless.My main issue with this set up despite it probably being more organic and authentic is that if there are no true regulations and the only inherent limiting factor would be a swords lowutility vs. armor then players would just end up not using swords altogether and just use spears or axes or maces all the time.And theres no real way to really drive that point home because in history even when the combatants werent armoured i.e. no brigandines no mail no plate people still used spears primarily over swords due to a number of reasons ease of manufacture reach etc. So if I just leave it to the player to decide to forgo swords in the field by subtly making all opponents they might encounter in the field armoured thats not really authentic. In short I need to either enforce or organically present a strong argument for the use of swords or else run the risk of them being completely disregarded. Some way to make it obvious but still logical that one should equip battlefield weapons like polearms and macesaxes while out in the field and deequip them and stick with swords and knives when inside a town or city.As you said convenience is key. But what would be a good way to implement that mechanistically? Continuously sapping players of stamina when they have battlefield weapons equipped might cause balance issues when exploring or traveling? Removing a chunk of their other abilities or stats i.e.  of your agility is temporarily deducted? Basically encumbering them?But if thats the case it might cause something akin to the FPScarryproblem. Wherein youre supposed to be lugging around  rifles at the same time but you only feel the immediate encumbering effects of the one youre carrying i.e. switching to a knife makes you move like Usain Bolt despite carrying  SMGs. So even if a spear or halberd is unequipped players either automatically feel the advantages of unequipping them which is undesirable since its unrealistic or they dont feel advantages until they outright remove the item from their inventory which is inconvenient for the player and might not be intuitively discoverable as a feature.One way is to emphasize some other major strength not just as a status symbolCHAmodifier that swords have over other weapons aside from convenience. Is a sword more lethal against lightlyarmoured opponents? If I fight a nonarmoured person while using a sword vs. using a mace will it be easier to deal damage with a sword? According Matt Easton this is the case but is this an appreciable difference?,RPGdesign,dfy0nlz,1,t5_31cnk
11518597,0,t1_dfyif40,Really interesting setting and genre!I gotta admit PFM and DF make me think accounting not divinity though is that intentional?Im not sure what inversely influence Patron rolls part means. Allow me to make a guess the sum of all PFMs God has becomes the modifier for Patron rolls on the next round? So if God is passed  PFM from all three Angels then everyone gets  on their Patron roll next turn?I think this system sounds really cool and is going to play very thematically but it doesnt read very thematically. I feel no Biblical awe or cosmic importance. It feels like accounting.Some suggestions to shorten clarify or spice up Distribute a die across each could be Assign one die each? I think that makes sense. If not Assign one die to each definitely seems clearer to me but doesnt shave a word off.Ignore PFM and pass it to God or Divert PFM to another Angel could become or Gift your PFM to another Angel or God no?Gods PFMs are summed together and subtracted from Patron rolls. Thats the same number of words but is clearer I think?To avoid acronyms maybe assign them more flavorful terms? That could help enrich the system. E.g...if this Patron Faith Modifier PFM becomes If the result called Belief.  word.Add final result to Domain Faith DF. becomes Add final result to your Glory.  word.I think just calling them Glory and Belief is more flavorful than the acronyms and of course theyre placeholders Belief could be Conviction Trust whatever.I also think emphasizing a flavorful word for DF is important if an Angels Glory for example goes negative then it makes sense that they fall from grace theyve become inglorious you know?Again overall this is fantastic! Love the concept and I think youre really onto something especially mechanically!,RPGdesign,dg1muqt,1,t5_31cnk

11656128,0,t3_666smz,I really dont like the idea of altering stats during gameplay. As a novice player you wont know which stat you should improve and either not care about it or worry about it. As an expert player you will have made your decision before the game even began.The idea that you have a pool of dice that you can add to important rolls is pretty good but I think it is a bad idea to tie it to the session. Unless a session always represents the same amount of ingame time.,RPGdesign,dgh8j2o,1,t5_31cnk

11707102,0,t3_671bhf,Alright so minor thing you misspelled normal as Mornal and the as toe on page . As far as the system goes it looks good overall. The only thing I could see that could be a problem is the difficulty ratings especially if youre running larger groups of players in which you could have multiple players expending all their effort to autocomplete earthshattering tasks. This could be and probably is tbh countered by the stress ratings but the stress dice have much lower minimums since its entirely possible that all the party members roll low on stress dice while having a guaranteed  added to each of their progress rolls.You could counter this by adding dice for each point of stress instead of increasing the die size but this also constrains the numbers somewhat and nobody likes that many ds. Or you could tweak the difficulty ratings to account for the number of player characters. Or you could get rid of this entire issue with instructions for the GM regarding difficulty and applying stress. From the looks of it any given player character should have a default stress score of  ingame since all decisions should have consequences and they should always be in some kind of danger living on the edge and allStress mechanics could maybe also use some tweaking. For instance since empathypsychopathy is a part of your system maybe for characters without ruthlessness scores should gain stress from physical violence which could further your goal of encouraging nonviolent problem solving. In the same vein since characters can reduce stress by doing something they enjoy. A player could argue that violent psychopaths really enjoy violence. This could encourage violence for players that choose violent psychopathic traits.  Possible numbers problems aside since you stated that escape could be a potential goal you should probably add vehicles to your item list andor similar conveyance items.What are the rules for determining attributes? There are modifiers for Financial status but what else? Do characters only start out with that?Other than those potential problems your mechanics look pretty darn solid. The remainder is formatting which is fine since youre in the early stages. Since Stress and Effort are vital to your conflict resolution mechanics they probably shouldnt be in the character creation section. You could add notes for each in there but honestly just putting the formula on a character sheet would be enough.And finally I dig how memories work in this very much.   ,RPGdesign,dgn139v,2,t5_31cnk

11798812,0,t3_68c4sn,I think world of darkness books are excellently laid out.It basically starts with a flavor chapterwhat the hell is this game about?Then it gives the core mechanic and character creation.Following that you get special rules for being the thing you are vampires get blood in this way werewolves rage is like that etc..  This includes special powers you get by virtue of being that specific thing.Then the general rules for other stuff like extended tasks combat etc.Finally in a perfectly ignorable place that I havent bothered to read in like a decade the probably unnecessary GM section an example adventure and a bestiaryantagonist section.Thats generally my favorite layout though I would be equally happy having all the rules before character creation as long as I get the rules that are typically left for character creation first i.e. I need to know what stats your game uses and what different levels of those stats mean. ,RPGdesign,dgxfpdh,4,t5_31cnk
11802680,0,t3_6792xz,It seems like most of the replies to this thread say you should put character creation after the rules that use the characters. Im going to play devils advocate for a minute.Dungeons and dragons and savage worlds both begin with character creation and then move on to explain the rules. Im sure that the reason is simple. Your rules all interact with characters. It can be difficult to explain any given rule if you havent covered the thing it uses. If you have attributes and most of your rules involve rolling dice and comparing them to your attributes then explaining what attributes are should come before any attempt to use them for combat skill checks exploration encumbrances or anything else that interact with them. Also many players will only read the rules section of your book once or twice but revisit character creation every time they start a new game.Thus Id structure the game into Introductionbasicslexicon Characters Rules GM settinglore character archetype specific references spells animal companions etc.,RPGdesign,dgxvi33,1,t5_31cnk
