My brain isnt designed to where figuring out people comes naturally like it supposedly does with most people and Im actually kinda curious as to why you still write if you dont think youre all that good. My  guesses would be . Youre practicing and wanting to get better . You dont really care how good you are and write just for the heck of it. Or maybe . Its a case of singer doesnt like his own voice but you know your stories are good. Could you tell me which one you think is right? Im actually pretty curious.,ICanDrawThat,cgmwo6t,1,t5_2sqsz

5290609,0,t3_3ng582,Hey man so Im not trying to say this in an angry or disrespectful way but if this is for a tattoo theres a much better way to go about this.I am a tattoo ARTIST. I became one because I am an exceptional artist and Ive always been drawn to the idea of permanent body art.Any good tattoo artist is just that an artist! We want to make custom art for you! Its our job because we made it our job. Seriously we want to make the design for you.At any respectable shop you will be able to book a consult with the artist of your choice for FREE. They will listen to all your ideas and once they receive a deposit from you they will make a design that is not only unique but utilizing their experience and training they will make sure that design is something that will actually fit and flow with wherever you are placing the piece on your body.If you want the piece to be a specific style go to all the shops near you and check out portfolios find someone that works in the style you desire. If you ask a colour realism artist to do black work they may not be pumped but someone who digs it will get stoked to do a design for you.Dont be afraid to ask the counter person if there is an artist in the shop who enjoys doing blackdot work sometimes that can be very helpful.I say all this because despite this site having tons of great artists sometimes some specific knowledge is necessary to make the design actually appropriate for a tattoo. Even when I came out of  years of art school and could make great painting compositions my first few tattoo designs during my apprenticeship were awful because I lacked the experience of actually working on the body.All Im saying is this subreddit is great for so many reasons but if youre putting something on your body forever seek out a professional and get their input.Best of luck with your tattoo,ICanDrawThat,cvnxr2z,3,t5_2sqsz

8599533,0,t3_4xkd37,Hello!Thanks for the concerned post. All I can say is many times the artists decide to not go through with the offer due to time restraints or just reasons we can not tell. Us moderators try our hardest to ensure that we remove the users that violate rule  which can be found belowgt Offer Threads These must receive at least one answered request in the first ten hours of its posting. Those who do not respond to any within ten hours will be removed depending on circumstances the mods may approve artists being absent for up to  hours.We will try our best to remove offers that fail to comply with this rule which gives much time for the artist to at least draw one of the requests on the offer thead. If the artist can not do this in  hours we allow in many circumstances for the artist to just simply request for a  hour time limit. As previously stated we are humans who are trying our best to remove the posts that violate this rule. If you as a subscriber come across one of these posts that we can or have not gotten to yet. Feel free to report the thread and we will try our best to respond as soon as one of us can!Thank you again for your concerns.,ICanDrawThat,d6gj90x,10,t5_2sqsz

You have to push against it and struggle to create whatever that may be.Dont worry about the product or about making the perfect piece. Take the time to enjoy the sound of the pencil hitting the paper the smell of the eraser and the state of flow that comes through creating. Enjoy every mistake that you make as you will never be able to push yourself if you dont free yourself from the perceived burden of failure.Ive been struggling with artist block recently and thinking about it this way has really helped push me to create.,ICanDrawThat,daxm768,1,t5_2sqsz

He is relatively handsome. With an athletic build at a height of  feet . m flat. Currently he is a vagabond.His outfit is an asymmetrical combination of leather and steel armor. The steel armor covers his entire right arm his chest and a simple pauldron. The other arm only has a leather bracer. The rest is just leather armor with a goatskin flask that hangs around his lower back. here is no hood or helmet. choice of weapon is a basic spear completely made out of steel with leather bindings in two different places. His other weapon is a runed dagger that is usually kept in a tarnished sheath on his belt. Of course there are your basic pouches and such.
