Find different friends or even just drop those that perpetuate your insecurities about your approval rating. If you didnt have anything to do or anything to become cuz you accomplished everything you wanted already would you give a damn for peoples opinion of you?Other than that I can say you are all that you have in this life so give yourself some fucking credit and a pair. ,NoExcuses,d0mxw4m,1,t5_2ua78

Friendships that are forged on sketchy behavior like that arent even friendships to be honest. Leaving the town is going to solve your problem temporarily or even permanently but the part that you take with you  which identifies with the reputation given to you by others and not yourself will still be there. It may sound high and mighty of me to tell you that but to be honest its the human condition we live and die in a fog of thoughts where we catch glimpses of clarity. Its quite okay you dont need to have all the answers all you need is faith in yourself as a human being that you matter to yourself more than the need for you to matter to others. Worrying about who one ups you or not is not going to solve your problem either. A little curiosity about the causes and perception of your suffering can give you some insight. Moving away or not is strictly a wise decision that you must or must not make but make it knowingly and have an active role instead of saying fuck it time to press the reset button .  Yes in cod all those zombies that come at you like a horde is overwhelming only because you look at them all at once instead look at one and mow them down accordinglytrust me level  advice here. Eventually youll be left with one or two which wont seem like a bother anymore. But seriously look into meditation learn to dwell in pain and no amount of suffering can pain you. I cant say I have had the same experiences but I can say that I have had similar issues to dealing with people and criticism and Ive learned a lot still am learning a lot about my conditioning. Ultimately we are nothing but dust that has acquired conscious means returning to dust eventually. Why not make the most of it? ,NoExcuses,d0nntsl,1,t5_2ua78
