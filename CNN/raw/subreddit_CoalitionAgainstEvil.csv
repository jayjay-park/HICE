11325880,0,t1_dffrmq9,No this was going to be a fun thing. See if all the smaller subs that outnumber the big ones could coordinate and take down evil.Despite already having the massive advantage you still cheated. Which completely takes the fun out of this game. If thats how you want to win so be it. Buy you completely killed the fun. Enjoy.,CoalitionAgainstEvil,dffrpwq,11,t5_3jp3s
11336293,0,t3_61scsj,We send ambassadors to the ELOE sub.Either the other  turn on the Pats now or we will collude with the Pats in the final stages. Most of them are only going along with it on the idea that they can gang up on the Pats when it gets to the final few. If thats no longer an option cracks will start to appear.,CoalitionAgainstEvil,dfgy6ew,10,t5_3jp3s

11355197,0,t3_621a08,I see a lot of people discouraged because the ELOE keeps winning the votes. Id like to tell those people  dont be just yet!This is a war not a battle and we need to think longterm. Eventually the ELOE will run out of teams with division rivals who hate them enough to ally with ELOE. Eventually they will run out of teams that a significant amount of people hate. And eventually the allies of ELOE will get bored after their hated rivals are defeated since theyll know they have no chance to win. All of this means that after a while the ELOE will lose support.We have to stay strong and united keep voting Pats or another single target if we change our minds for any reason and keep our numbers and morale up. Recruit from defeated team subs and try to tap into their need for cold hard revenge. All it will take is one victory one round for the Patriots to fall and the entire ELOE will topple like a house of cards built by the Cleveland Browns.Viva la comeback!,CoalitionAgainstEvil,dfj39tz,2,t5_3jp3s

11365128,0,t1_dfk7nw7,We need to see all we can muster and itll help divide the ELOE.For being a double agent I CREATED the coalition. Why would I create it and make the ELOEs domination a bit harder if I was a double agent.,CoalitionAgainstEvil,dfk7rux,5,t5_3jp3s
11368215,0,t3_628imo,It would be a honor to serve the CAE. Ill lay out a simple plan of action if Im sworn in Control the spam and spread of misinformation.  Its an embarrassing sight when you scroll up and down our sub. We need to get organized and need to get organized fast. How can one expect to know who to vote for when there are multiple threads on the front page popping up every minute?   Assign team ambassadors to ensure proper communication between the CAE and the teams that form it. We need to have contact communication with CAE teams subreddit so they are up to date with correct information. ,CoalitionAgainstEvil,dfkkcv2,17,t5_3jp3s

It might be too early but soon there will be a real fraction. You all should be working to widen them sooner and get in good with a few to further your cause.      If the plan is the Pats then you try to get the Steelers and Cowboys on board.,CoalitionAgainstEvil,dflq8c0,3,t5_3jp3s

11465558,0,t3_63nz58,I actually think it is in the Coalitions best interest for the Chaos plan to continue as it allows members of the coalition to remain alive when otherwise they would be the first teams to be targeted.

Go look at the comments being upvoted in the voting thread we made this close against a total backstab and some of the largest numbers of antipats votes weve seen.
