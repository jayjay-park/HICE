7774581,0,t3_4lrgho,We desperately need to get up the new code. We pivoted technically and relaunched with giving up at least for now our ambitions for having all our tooling fit our ideals.The activity feed was a feature of the code we built that connects to our discussion system and ticketing and wiki stuff. Unfortunately managing all of that was beyond our scope. So we moved to  fully FLO but annoyingly JavaScriptfrontend heavy for our project management see all the activity there were making plans for moving our blog our wiki is now at  and we have code stuff at  see lots of activity there. Well likely add a Discourse instance to replace at least for now both our stillactive mailing lists see   and our nowinactive discussion board system.Personally I had been the person most active in making sure that the publicfacing stuff was clean and uptodate. I have had some major family things that just have distracted me lately. Thankfully someone else is taking over a lot of the community things including finishing getting stickers and such out to donors something weve started but not finished! and thats focused on getting us really working with CiviCRM see the post about that So effectively our pivot and shifts have made us reconsider some of the backend and the organizational things and getting that solid will have us in far better shape to then get back on track to really launching.Incidentally at least some of us will be at Open Source Bridge next month so come see us there oh and IndieWebCamp summit thing in Portland next weekend too.Our IRC channel is still quite active too.Thanks for your interest and support! Sorry for the confusion lately!,freeculture,d3pwntu,9,t5_49zi
