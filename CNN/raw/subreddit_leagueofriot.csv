11206709,0,t3_5zzhgr,Developmental Insights Into the Pathology of and Therapeutic Strategies for DM Back to the Basics Anthony Chau and Auinash KalsotraFig. . Schematic model of the genetic mutation responsible for DM pathogenesis. DM is a multisystemic disease that affects the heart skeletal muscle gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. CUG repeat expansion at the UTR of the DMPK gene causes formation of ribonuclearfoci that sequester MBNL and upregulates CELF through microRNA misregulation and PKC activation. Misregulation of these RNAbinding proteins affects a wide range of posttranscriptional and translational events ultimately resulting in developmental remodeling of the transcriptome.Human Diagram used here was obtained from,leagueofriot,df29myn,1,t5_344rj
