43464,0,t3_1ukw6j,That looks like a problem with the Airportwireless card.  Try booting up in Safe mode  start the machine and hold down Shift.  It will take a long time to boot up.  If you can boot up back up your files take into an Apple store and have them futz around with it.  If it wont boot up start it up and hold down T on keyboard connect it to another Mac via Firewire and back up your stuff.  Then take it to Apple.If its out of warranty and you feel comfortable can handle a screwdriver and can face the risk of breaking anything at your own risk then open it up and disconnect the WiFi card and see if that changes anything.  ,mac,cejdoh8,0,t5_2qh4u

I bought that machine a little over a year ago from the Apple refurbished site for nearly .  It retailed new for over .  I could absolutely crush it with a  Windows machine if Game performance was the measure being applied.  I constantly get slammed and down voted in the iPhone Mac Apple OS X and BootCamp subReddits for speaking the raw unvarnished truth.  If there is one thing I have learned it is that Apple people do not like to have the reality distortion field punctured with inconvenient truth. I have owned Apple products since the early s and have owned a variety of PCs android devices and the entire mind boggling array of Apple equipment I currently own.     My opinions tend to be informed by personal experience but some people simply dont like to hear that devices they ascribe a lifestyle and personal identity with may be inadequate or inferior to other market alternatives.Before you cult members start private messaging me again know thisMy current and only computer is a  inch retina MacBook Pro that is completely maxed out. My current and only smart phone is a  GB iPhone s.My current and only tablet is a  GB iPad Air.I use an Apple TV Apple airport express Apple trackpad Apple Magic mouse Apple Bluetooth keyboard and Apple USB fullsize keyboard. I often complain about Apple products not because I hate them but because I have been and IT nut my entire life and simply want Apple products to be better where they can be.

If you have a spinning disk you wont even begin to measure slowdown until  full and you wont be able to actually notice it until at least  full maybe as much as  full. If you have an SSD it matters even less.If you want a pure software solution upgrading to Mavericks will probably help but there are some cases where it hurts.

921476,0,t3_24npq1,Fun fact Unless you are using a plasma TV screensavers on modern devices destroy your screen. Waiting for some moron to try to whine about how it doesnt physically destroy the screenThe screensaver comes from a time when computers used CRTs which were prone to burnin if an image was left on them for too long. Thus the screen saver would save the panel from this fate by projecting an everchanging image thereon. So why not just put your computer to sleep and shut off the screen entirely? Save the trouble and its a single second to wake up.This was back in the days both before sleep functions in computers and before sleep functions were in any way an expedient way to get your computer back up and running. You may as well have just shut down. But now in the modern world of LCD displays and SSD storage putting your computer to sleep is the better option.Apple has continued to offer the screensaver capability to cater exclusively to plasmabased displays. Because come on why else would you purposely reduce the lifespan of your screens backlight?,mac,ch9109d,2,t5_2qh4u

That is to say if one of the two drives that make up a Fusion Drive fail all the data on both would be lost.That said using Fusion Drive is a very painfree way of making the most out of both the speed of an SSD and the capacity of an HDD much more so than manually choosing different locations to store your various types of data.

At worst youll get similar specs for cheaper or updated specs for the same exact price.  Regardless of speculation and rumors... As long as your current laptop isnt completely dead or for some other reason you need a replacement right away it always pays to wait a few months for the revampupdate. Theres a good chance youll end up kicking yourself later for not waiting. For the few months you wait now you can probably squeeze a year of continued use out of it down the road before the software catches up and it starts to become obsolete.  ,mac,cioqyp6,2,t5_2qh4u

Are you using a hard disk drive? It might be worth replacing if so possibly with an SSD its not a good sign if the volume disappears like that.Bear in mind this will erase all your data but you wont be able to get to it easily anyway.

3086231,0,t1_cohutkv,Geek Squad is dedicated to computer repair theyre not on a sales floor no excuses for them theyre supposed to be computer repair guys. And if a customer rushes you then explain the process and how long it takes. My turn around time is  days max. Hardware that requires replacement is different shipping etc or soldering and installation for SMDs.I wrote the standard operating procedure used by a local repair shop and trained employees at two others its inexcusable to give a computer back without it being done and reinstalling the OS is more time intensive than knowing how to repair the OS with tools like preboot environments and automated tools. Customers dont like losing all of their little settings and things they want their system the same but cleaned reinstalling the OS and thus all of their software drivers etc is far more costly than repairing the system. It is all about what takes the least amount of time in any repair shop from speed of service to hourly wage theres plenty of reason to do things the fastest way.I know theyre limited to the tools they use but as a business owner its mildly upsetting to watch people get  the service you provide for  times the cost. Except then again I enjoy undercutting geek squad and making them look bad word travels I made it clear to the customer how bad that is and to tell their friends about it and to not use geek squad.

Purchased mainly as a second computer mostly for my wife who is a Montessori Teacher and wanted a Mac to use for her work at home as she used to have one of those white polycarbonate iBook years ago.My experience so far Macmini starts to bog down if more than one account is logged in at the same time and accounts are running more than three apps concurrently. If I am just using my own account with all other accounts completely logged out just running iTunes with Google Chrome with  tabs open brings my available memory down to  according to the Memory Clean app. Gaming is pathetic  I can run Eve Online and World of Warcraft with the latest expansion but only in the lowest GPU settings and it gets a bit laggy. Can not upgrade either the RAM or the Hard Drive in the  Mac Mini editions so spring for the best you can afford. That being said I actually find myself using the macmini far more than my custom built i Windows . gaming computer which I built myself for over K. I am using this Mac Mini with a  AOC ESHE LCD monitor which works awesome and I totally recommend as a low cost large screen monitor with a Logitech K keyboard Logitech M Trackball and Logitech X Speakers.

3161403,0,t1_copijwq,gt Think about RAM. Most people will probably upgrade if needed and really is GB at  hurting many who have a budget for a Mac? Theres really only three models Mini and Air still shipping with default GB right now. For the rest GB is adequate and again the option to bump it up is there but for a GB machine I dont feel integrated graphics would be up to par anyways. Its the fastest RAM the processors can typically support its lowprofile and lowvoltage. They aint skimping there.The RAM is soldered on now.  In everything except the iMac and the Mac Pro.  The problem is if you buy a computer and find out a few months or a year later that you could use a boost you have to buy a whole new computer. Doesnt that seem silly to you?

Im a very tech oriented person and I like being up to date on all the newest hardware available for both Macs and PCs just to stay in the loop. Because of that I have a lot of knowledge on fixing computers from a hardware perspective. Most of the time when you take a computer in to get repaired its not a software issue but a hardware issue. Thats why I like owning a computer that I can take apart because in the long run I can find the problem and replace the offending part wwwaaaaaayyyyy cheaper than taking it to a repair shop.Due to that logic the latest Mac that I bought was a Mid  MBP non retina because it was the last in the long line of Macs that could be taken apart to perform maintenance on.Will I buy a soldered chipset Mac or PC in the future? Probably but right now I dont have the means or the need really to justify purchasing something that I cant maintain. It just doesnt make sense right now. I understand why more companies are doing this these days but the demographic that they are targeting simply isnt me.Unfortunately I dont really have any recommendations for a part swappable PC just because I havent needed to look for one in such a long time.

3198219,0,t3_2wr13u,True story. In  I bought a  iMac upgraded to GB for independent film production work. In  I expanded a little bit and bought a topotheline PC custom built from CyberPowerPC with GB to use a Windowsbased workstation and occasional game box.In that time I have produced and edited  K feature films and several smaller HD and K projects on the iMac.The PC got used for one project before the first problem failing hard drive took it offline. CyberPowerPC was helpful enough with that one getting fixed. After that it got infected by a virus despite running AV taking it offline again until it could be cleaned. After that the nVidia video card died and required replacement out of pocket now. After that the disk controller stopped working.At this moment I am on that trusty hardworking neverfailing  iMac typing. Four feet away stands a younger theoretically more powerful DEAD PC I really have no serious intention of reviving.This final statement is entirely true EVERY PC I have every used for work or personal experience whether I bought it myself or it was provided to me by work whether it was built custom from scratch by AlienWare or CyberPowerPC or et al or it was from a big PC vendor like Dell or HP  EVERY PC I have ever used had a similar story.I do not like to tinker with my computer and yet I have a degree in computer science am a programmer and digital film maker  I use computers every moment of my working life.I use Macs  and will use them exclusively for the foreseeable future  because they work reliably for years the software I use is excellent they are less expensive to maintain I dont have to fiddle with my hardware and they run on top of unix which I do leverage.PS  I am considering making one upgrade to the  iMac in the near future sending it off to have the original TB internal hard drive replaced with an SSD.,mac,cothu05,0,t5_2qh4u

Some phones had this optionally built in like the Palm Pre which was available with a charging station where you had to place the phone on and there are also charging cases for the iPhone available AFAIK. But all these solutions require that you put the device on a surface with some embedded coils. And even on this very short distance the efficiency is quite bad.If you would emit enough power via WiFi to charge a device the WiFi would need broadcast power of a microwave other frequencies and undirected and not only would that be not very nice to have in your living room but also the power consumption would be horrendous.

Looked like the drive was going bad so I pulled the drive and made an image of it on a Linux box and had no issue repairing the image verifying the data was intact. Feeling good about the data being safe I tried to repair the filesystem on the drive again no problem. SMART said it was in prefail so it was time to replace the drive regardless.I imaged the old drive to a new TB drive and verified it would mount and boot on my laptop. Replace it back in her laptop same problem. Spent nearly a day trying different things. Sometimes the machine would see the drive and partially boot. Running Disk Utility off the installer showed the drive but reported it MBR formatted even though I made sure it was GUID formatted. After speanding a day and a half dicking with it I took it into Apple.They went through all the same steps I did and finally said it was the drive cable. Cable was  and labour was .

However the one glaring issue I do have....and many other users with the MBPs is the lockups after closing the laptop lid. It happens after a lengthy period of time of sleephibernation with the lid closed. Open the lid and the login screen appears. You put in your password and then nothing happens after hitting enter. You are locked out and only a hard reboot will get you back in. This issue as I have done a lot of research predates Yosemite something Apple has never fixed but yet it is carriedover. It is annoying and means I can never close my lid. I have tried every trick in the book as well as other users including reinstalling the OS with only default apps and the issue remains.

I guess they could also be waiting for feedback from the MacBooks new designed keyboard and might want to pop that onto the  to help slim it down or free up room for other goodies like larger battery.  Ive seen a ton of rumors last few weeks predicting June I guess that is just after the WWDC but I saw one person comment that it likely wont get updated in June since the new CPU wont be ready till this fall. Either way I guess you should tough it out until the WWDC since they could launch the refresh then or at least announce the timeframe of refresh and what the refresh will give us.

Looking ahead you will be using A LOT of different engineering programs most of which either have a poor mac version or no mac version at all. Having  OS systems on the Air would pretty much fill it. Pro Tip install Windows to Bootcamp. from there you can either boot straight to Windows from Bootcamp or use a Virtual Machine to run the two together.something to consider any MBP before retina has removable storage and are much easier to futureproof. Ive got an Apple Refurbished  MBP in with a  GB SSD for OS X and Windows  and their programs a  TB HDD for storage in my disk drive spot and  GB RAM. The stock bits are a . GHz i  and AMD Radeon HD M. It restarts faster than it takes my s edge to turn on. The retinas unfortunately have almost everything soldered to the motherboard so theyre a pain to work on.Better yet get a nice Windows laptop and build it for the same price as the macs cost. Youll get something considerably more powerful.  Design work is a ton of fun but very resource consuming. Plus I mean who doesnt want a touch screen..

A thunderbolt dock or USB . hub to easily hook up all your fixed devices with only one cable An extra magsafe charger for your desk. Keep the one you already have in your bag. I like using an iSaver to keep the display clean and protect it from the keyboard keys An external disk or NAS for Time Machine backups. Youll be glad you have them when you need them. Consider an airport time capsule if youd also like to have an .ac router or AP. If you already have a tablet get a Sidecar to attach it to your macbooks screen and use it as a second display VMWare Fusion or Parallels to run Windows applications in a VM. You could try Virtualbox but at a significant performance cost. A Plugbug lets you charge your macbook and a smartphone or tablet using just one power outlet. Use the applications InsomniaX or NoSleep if you want to prevent your mac from sleeping while on AC or when closing the lid. A mouse. The touchpad is awesome but if you like to play video games youll still want a mouse. I use the Razer Orochi because its compact has bluetooth and can still work wired. Use iCloud. It really shines when youre using both a mac and iOs devices but even if you have just the Mac its useful Find my Mac iCloud notes ...  Earplugs or headphones with single plug for microphone and stereo inline micremote optional. The Sennheiser mmi is a good affordable option though there are other options if you want more bells amp whistles and have money to spend. I can give recommendations on those if youre interested. Get AppleCare. Seriously. Its a three year extended warranty. Even if youre in Europe and thus have  years the extra year is worth the money.

I bought a  i|gb|GTm|gb  Macbook Pro Retina for AUD They retail for AUD it had  months warranty left I payed another AUD for bonus  years of warranty. So my total was  for a  month old MBPr with  years and  months of warranty with exact same specs of a brand new  MBPr GT m instead of R mx though and no force trackpad plus  hour less battery life and only  year warranty. Basically when buying used ask the seller if he has gone through this page .. This is the most important step. Second step is just to check the aesthetics of the laptop test all the ports each key stroke check the display check backlight trackpad basically every aspect. Write up a local contract and get the details of the seller keep everything formal and if anything is too happen that the seller lied about you have the evidence. If the seller cant provide original packaging or a receipt of purchase I wouldnt go near it either check the serial  on the back of the laptop and search it online for more details.

It stays in their room is a huge distraction grades often go down and you and I both know that sites with age verification for violence andor porn are incredibly easy to get around.No matter what desktop or notebook set up the main admin account for momdadyou and then set up a standard account with parental controls turned on for your little cousin.

YMMV though depending on if youve continued to import files to one application and not the the other so be careful.Today I still use Lightroom and Photos.app side by side.  Lightroom is for everything from my DSLR and I only export and then import completed edits and stuff I really want on all my devices from LR to Photos.app.  Otherwise it just dedicated to my iPhone photos and videos and LR contains all the rest.

I can only recall Google Chrome having Flash included and this is a special sand boxed version. Also note that modern browsers typically have H video decoder support so Flash is mostly no longer needed for video playback in browsers. I mostly run into needing Flash for data visualization and for videos on some news sites.Javascript on the other hand is a integral part of all browsers if first appears in  a few years after the first browsers. It can be turned off on some browser but doing this will break a lot of websites especially more app like ones. Using Javascript does incurs some security risks but is considerably safer than Flash.Edit use an adblocker this will reduce the risk for running into potentially malicious javascripts included in some ads.

Replaced the CPUs with a pair of X and added GB of  RAM for less than .Compare the CPUs I upgraded to vs the New Mac Pro The speed improvement is maybe  for the newer model and keep in mind that its only comparing ONE CPU against another. My machine has TWO.My machines Geekbench multicore score is . There are only TWO machines in Apples line up that beat it. The Mac Pro Late  with Intel Xeon E v  . GHz  cores and the Mac Pro Late  with Intel Xeon E v  . GHz  cores.Sure my RAM SATA interface and PCIe are slower but my wallet is FATTER and Im getting just as much work done as if I had spent six times as much. I expect to get  more years of useful life out of this machine barring any catastrophic hardware failures which will be cheap and easy to remedy anyway.gtBut if Apple isnt going to offer the hardware I need then I must do what needs must.Christ doesnt anyone have actual computer skill anymore? Its sickening how jaded people have become and just thumb their nose at hardware because of its chronological age while completely ignoring its capabilities.gtBack in the day I had a sweet tricked out overclocked Powerbase  and my dads PB was acknowledged to be the fastest known by the Macfixit community.

Seriously if you can not put RAM in a RAM slot you cant put the HDMI in the HDMI plug either  it is literally just plugging the shape that fits in the similar shape. We figured this out when we were toddlers. The people using the system will not be the people building it  once built that is done. It is software use from there not hardware and I would suggest Plex as many people use Plex on their Apple TVs with no problems.Apple has convinced people they are too stupid to follow simple instructions so spend more money and get less with them! Yes the Mini will be marginally easier but it will be less of a home media server for it and with less future upgradability down the line.Its just advice for OP to consider no need to throw insults man if he doesnt like it he doesnt have to do it but he is better off knowing more about the topic he is interested in and I promise it is easy to do  do not let people fool you in to thinking they are wizards because they know shapes.,mac,dbl6u5q,1,t5_2qh4u

10864117,0,t1_de0htoh,Acid doesnt cover everything thats within the standards and doesnt fully test Javascript APIs.For instance Safari is broken when it comes to drawing video on a canvas see  and has been for over a year. Not everyone needs to do this but its a very typical thing to do if your app works with video files.caniuse.com shows Safari well behind Chrome and Firefox and roughly on par with Edge. Many simple things like the color input type and download anchor attribute were only just added in the not yet released Safari .. Couple this with Safaris long release cycle and this means developers wanting to use a newer HTMLJavascript feature are either forced to use a polyfill if available or offer reduced functionality to Safari users and direct those users to use ChromeFirefox.It doesnt have to be this way. Apple could adequately resource Safari and move it to a shorter release cycle. Itd certainly be better for the web to avoid a Chrome monoculture.,mac,de0k232,1,t5_2qh4u

10910818,0,t3_5vvx6u,I believe the answer is nothing.  When it comes to RAM youre stuck with what you get.  With the SSD you can upgrade it but its nearly cost prohibitive.  You can replace the stock SSD with another higher capacity drive that was pulled from another MacBook Pro or you can buy a higher capacity drive from Other World Computing.  Either path will cost you quite a bit for what youre actually getting.  The best route should you decide to take it is to get an external hard drive or SSD.,mac,de5dgfz,4,t5_2qh4u

I had it and returned it in the day trial now using a Razer Blade Stealth but with the thought of going to a base model  Macbook Pro.
