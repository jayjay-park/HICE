She even loves the ugly onesShe feeds and houses the neighborhood strays in our garage and has placed blankets in there the last few nights. In fact just last night I went to get warm towels from the dryer and noticed that it was open with towels hanging out of it. Where could my towels have gone you guessed it out to the garage. There are many other stories I could tell like when we were looking at the stars with her brother Ryan and I said look Orion and she wanted to know where Oella was. You better believe that I found one. She is just a great kid. The bike that she liked is on her list. Good luck everyone and Thank you for this offer. ,SantasLittleHelpers,cm5zh93,3,t5_2yohc

2597885,0,t3_2pkrcz,hugsNot that you really asked me  but I have never been someone to keep completely quiet  About Jealousy  it depends on the type of jealousy  If you are the type of Jealous that says  that says  Ohhh look at that person I wish I was as lucky as that person and was able to be gifted like that which could be productive jealousy because it could lead you to examine maybe what about that person might be attracting the attention  are they more active are they going through a rougher time are they posting more pictures of their kids  do they post at a certain time  all of those things could possibly play into it as well as luck.  And you maybe able to adjust your behaviour  adding in more pictures or posting at a time when no one else is so you could be noticed more etc.  Of course it could be more of the destructive non productive jealousy which says  it isnt fair if I cant get it NO ONE should or no one I deem isnt worthy should and that leads to some of the negative behaviours we are seeing.   SO yes I think you can be a bit jealous and happy for a person. Anywyas after that long ramble.  I am so glad you found this place!

5702672,0,t1_cx3yfvd,Is it calcification that is causing your stenosis? Mine is a disc bulging into my spinal canal and causing narrowing. If it gets any worse they can do a microdiscectomy. I am also facing the possibility of a trilevel fusion if the herniated discs get any worse. I have a lot of pain inducing conditions but I think the worst part is not knowing which issue is causing which pain or how to treat it. The back leg and butt pain could be the disc the spinal narrowing or the SI joint dysfunction. They dont know which condition causes the piriformis syndrome the muscle spams in my leg. The Lupus and RA cause widespread neuropathy in my arms shoulders legs and feet but the foot pain could also be from the spine compression..... aaaaand so on and so forth. The second worst part and that there are days weeks even months where I Am  fine I can work I can be somewhat active and normal activity is doable then bam the next day I am in the hospital and facing months of recovery from a flare. I am only ... I have a long way to go ,SantasLittleHelpers,cx3z04x,0,t5_2yohc

5786797,0,t3_3tcr8l,As Told By Katelin She is  with severe special needs Hi Lily your a pretty girl. I hope you will be my best friend. I dont have many friends I dont tell mommy but I only have . Kids tease me and call me names. But Lily you know what it is how you feel about yourself. Words hurt but your feelings matter most. I know you must be lonely by yourself at night sleeping alone in your bed. I get lonely sometimes to Well a lot now. My sister is gone we used to share a room but she sleeps with Jesus now. So does my daddy and my brother. If you were here Lily we could play everyday and talk at night. I could tell you my secrets my fears no one knows.      I am not good at bedtime stories but I will do my best.  Goodnight sweet girls Katelin and Lilly. Lay your heads down to rest. Close your eyes and never fear because you will never be alone again. Where one goes the other will follow.  hearts joined together as one. Someone to laugh with someone to cry with someone to play with. Even someone to snuggle with in the darkness on the night. So close your eyes sweet girls and lay down your head because now you will never be alone.edited  misspelled words sorry,SantasLittleHelpers,cxeeo57,1,t5_2yohc

My daughter also grabbed her favorite doll took it over to Ms. K to hug so Ms. K would feel better.   Then my uber compassionate  year old played quietly with her siblings while Ms. K and I discussed the reason she was upset.  When Ms. K. and the siblings had to leave my daughter said to Ms. K. Are you feeling better now? I hope so. No more reason to cry. Love you. She does stuff like this a lot. ,SantasLittleHelpers,cxq0ozn,1,t5_2yohc

She is actually Haylees a wonderful little girl that my husband and I are trying to adopt and who is living with us since her bio parents are incapable grandma and she cant get around on her own and is very very sickly so I do her shopping for her change her wound bandaids take her to doctor appts etc. She has been saying for so long now how she wants nothing more than to be able to take a nice warm relaxing bath and were working on getting one of those handicap accessible bathtubs installed in her home and it will be done by Christmas so what better surprise than a nice spa set for her to enjoy. I believe she would enjoy the gold box as that is what all her Christmas decorations are is gold colored  Another thing I really love from this shop is the mistletoe soap... it looks so pretty!  Anyways I just thought Id enter and see if I cant get something to make her smile after all she has been through and put up with.

I replaced it after my old one was stolen and only used it a few times unfortunately. Its currently sitting in my closet. I always hoped to find a way to get it to someone who could enjoy it but I wasnt aware of a good avenue to find someone until seemingly now. I can PM you my email with the mention of the PS and maybe you can send an address I dont have a habit of checking my PMs on Reddit for me to send the console to.

6012660,0,t3_3xsmrl,I wanted to say thank you for sharing.  My story is...well sort of the opposite but not really at the same time.  I was hit by a drunk driver at  and had my entire career derailed I was premed at the time.  Ended up going into medical transcription.  At the time I was  years old essentially wheelchair bound and made amazing money for a kid who had virtually no expenses other than my own entertainment.  My rent was ish a month and was basically all inclusive.  I lived with the woman who trained me for my job.  I was clearing  grand a month fairly quickly so money was not really a concern.  So I always was helping everyone else for the holidays.  Met a man got pregnant got marriedmoved into a home of our own.  The bills were higher but we were managing still.  He didnt have a spectacular job but we were getting by.  Then the hurricanes hit in  and the bottom dropped out.  We had had another baby a year later and then when I was pregnant with that baby he left.  I am finally in a position where things are starting to improve.  I now have three kids and a much better man in my life who stands by me.  I still work in the same field and work my butt off but I am proof that anything is possible.  They told me after that accident I would never walk again.  I beat that set of odds.  I can beat any other set they throw at me.  We are on the road to recovery financially.  It just takes time.  Remember not to give up and to celebrate the small victories people.  Merry Christmas.,SantasLittleHelpers,cy7se2e,2,t5_2yohc

Plus they had a craft table  Christmas displays and a nice warm fire pit for us adults. It was a nice day and not to expensive so it was very nice. I thought Santa and Ms. Claus look that the image I had of them as a kid too.  They looked realistic I guess. Plus I told the Elf at the front of the line a few things to tell each of them because I wanted it to seem like he had been watching. ,SantasLittleHelpers,daskyg6,1,t5_2yohc
