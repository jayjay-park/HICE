8923639,0,t3_4yq4rq,WhitmanHanson Express  July     of Maura is Missing  By Maribeth Conway and Josh Cutler  Part I The Departure  Maura was a cross country star during her days at WhitmanHanson High School. Quiet shy but fierce on the track is how fellow Umass track team member Nastran Shams describes her.In the winter of  yearold Maura Murray of Hanson a talented athlete and nursing student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst got into to her car drove to the woods of northern New Hampshire and disappeared. Not a trace of her has been found since despite an intensive search and investigation. What happened to Maura Murray? How after her car skidded into a snow bank on a mild winter night could she simply disappear? In a multipart report the Express examined the circumstances surrounding Mauras disappearance and traces her steps from Amherst Mass. to Woodsville N.H. The story begins in a UMass dormitory...  Thursday Feb.    It was an overcast night at the University of Massachusetts Amherst campus. Maura Murray a junior nursing major and deans list student was working the campus security desk at the Melville dormitory. Her job was to check identification as students entered the dorm.  Mauras shoulderlength brown hair was likely pulled back tightly in a bun as it nearly always was. Friends knew Maura as a highlymotivated achiever who could be shy at times but was also a freespirit. She ran on the college track team and was an excellent athlete who broke her high school record in the twomile run.  During a slow point in her shift around  p.m. Maura chatted on the phone with her older sister Kathleen. The two were discussing men troubles specifically Kathleens tiff with her then fianc now husband Tim Carpenter. The two sisters talked nearly every day and this conversation was not unlike any other Kathleen would later say. Maura was especially close to Kathleen and her other older sister Julie. She also had two brothers Freddy and Kurt.  Maura did not burst into tears right after hanging up the phone contrary to some published reports. But she did start crying about three hours later for reasons that remain unclear. Maura was comforted by her work supervisor Karen Mayotte who walked her back to her single room in the Kennedy dormitory around  a.m. Maura never told Mayotte why she was upset. Supervisors are on a minute rotation so Mayotte would not have been present for Mauras entire shift.  Whatever was bothering Maura she did not share it with her friends or father who visited her at UMass on Saturday Feb.  less than  hours later.  Growing up Maura had lived with her mother in Hanson but she retained an especially close relationship with her father Fred Murray.  Maura lived in the highrise Kennedy Dorm and worked campus security in Melville dormitory both in the southwest area of UMassAmherst.When Fred wasnt coaching her in youth sports or attending one of her track meets he and Maura would go camping or hiking usually in the mountains of New Hampshire. Fred came to UMass that weekend to help Maura go car shopping. Mauras black  Saturn sedan was in rough shape running on just three cylinders. Maura drove the Saturn as little as possible. The father and daughter were looking at a threeyearold Geo Prizm. She would have had a new car by next week Fred said later.  After a day of car shopping on Saturday the two had dinner at the Amherst Brewing Company on North Pleasant Street in downtown Amherst. Each time Fred visited Maura their routine included trying another of the many local brew pubs in the area.  Mauras friend Kate Markopoulos joined them at the restaurant later that night. After dinner and drinks Mauras father was ready to head back to the Quality Inn a motel on Russell St. in neighboring Hadley. Fred offered Maura his new Toyota Corolla to drive for the evening. Maura dropped her father off at the motel and returned with her friend to UMass.  Back on campus Maura attended a small party in the dorm with Kate and their friends. The girls were chatting and drinking Skyy Blue malt mixed with wine friend Sara Alfieri later said in an interview with Seventeen magazine. At some point Maura mentioned that she wanted to return the car to her father that night which didnt make sense to Kate since it was so late Maura had been drinking and her father wasnt expecting the car until the next day the magazine reported.  Around  a.m. Maura told friends she was heading home to her dorm room. Instead she got into her fathers car and drove toward his motel. While driving along Route  in Hadley Maura slammed into a guardrail causing about  worth of damage to the Toyota. Local police responded to the scene of the accident but no charges were filed.  Maura got a ride back to her fathers motel. When Fred Murray learned of the accident Maura was shaken up and extremely apologetic. She was upset but it was okay Fred recalled. If this is the only trouble a kid ever causes then youre pretty lucky as a parent.  At  on Sunday morning a little while after the accident Maura called her boyfriend Billy Rausch on her fathers cell phone. Billy consoled her over the phone though he would later say he thought there was more than just the accident on Mauras mind.  Billy was an army lieutenant who was stationed at Fort Sill Oklahoma. Just a few weeks earlier Maura had arranged for a summer job at a hospital in Oklahoma to be closer to Billy. They would have ended up married said Fred. Later Billy would tell a local newspaper that he and Maura were engaged to be engaged.  The couple met while studying at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and began dating in the fall of . After three semesters Maura transferred to UMass to continue her studies. Military just wasnt for her said Andrea Connolly a high school friend who ran on the track team with Maura.Billy and Maura remained close after her transfer traveling between their schools to spend time together.  After a few calls Sunday morning Feb.  it appeared Freds insurance would cover the accident and it was time to move on. Fred had a work obligation in Bridgeport Connecticut so he rented a car and dropped Maura off at her UMass dorm. That evening at  p.m. Fred talked to Maura on the phone and reminded her to pick up accident forms from the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Maura agreed to call her dad on the phone the next night Monday at  to go over the forms and fill out the insurance information.  The next day Monday Feb.  Maura made a number of phone calls.  Just before  p.m. she called Dominic and Linda Salamone a couple who own a rental condominium at the Seasons at Attitash Resort in Bartlett New Hampshire. Mauras family which frequented the Bartlett area had stayed at the Seasons though never at this condominium.  The Salamones dont remember the conversation with Maura but they are certain she did not book their condominium. To do so on such short notice would have been impossible explained Linda Salamone. We dont operate like a hotel. Rentals must be booked far in advance in order for the Salamones to drop a key in the mail.  The call to the Salamones lasted about three minutes records show. Linda Salamone speculates she might have offered Maura recommendations on other places to stay though her memory was foggy by the time police finally interviewed her  nearly a year after Maura went missing.  Maura called a fellow nursing student at  p.m. though the purpose for her call is not clear. According to John Healey a New Hampshire private investigator who is familiar with the case Maura may have arranged to give her scrubs to a fellow nursing student. Family member Helena Murray maintains that Maura always conscientious was merely returning scrubs she borrowed from another student.  At  p.m. Maura made a fiveminute call to GOSTOWE where hotel bookings can be made. The Go Stowe system was actually out of order at this time so Maura could not have made a reservation and could only listen to voice recordings.  Also on Monday Maura sent an email to her boyfriend Billy Rausch. Mauras email to Billy that day read I love you more stud I got your messages but honestly i didnt feel like talking to much of anyone i promise to call today though The message was signed love you maura.  At  p.m. Maura called Billy on his cell phone and left a brief voicemail message. She said something along the lines of I love you I miss you I want to talk according to Billys mother Sharon Rausch. The cell phone Maura used was a gift from Billy but Sharons name was on the account.  Billy would later be shipped out to Iraq.  ,MauraMurrayEvidence,d7khnzt,1,t5_3fu1g
