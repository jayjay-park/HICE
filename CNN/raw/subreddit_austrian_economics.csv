17150,0,t1_cefm8hk,Who exactly? No offense but the tips arent really helpful. First  interest rates wont go out and effect every sector. There are also several factors to consider such as comsumption rate ratio of supply and demand subjective value...The rates havent done any significant change. I would agree with the housing market on interest rate IF AND ONLY IF Janey Yellen gets appointed and promises her policies regarding that market alone. Yet there is also the importance of foreclosure demand this can account for nearly any operation... The problem I have with economic boomsbusts is that the time is somewhat irrevelant untill it happens. So even as much as people like the ABCT or some sort of buy low and sell high is when will it happen.If anyone here wants a career advice regarding marketing get a certificate in finance investments marketing or even just certificates to allow you in your state to operate in many sectors such as real estate. Having human capital in that subject will make it alot easier for you to under how that system works I would reccomend people to take entrepeneurship classes.,austrian_economics,cegdwqe,5,t5_2stjd
96458,0,t3_1unw7u,the fundamental rule of economics is the existence of a tradeoff.Minimum wage gives some low wage worker more money right?Whats the tradeoff? Does another worker lose his job entirely? Does the referenced Smith increase his stores prices?,austrian_economics,cepetpx,1,t5_2stjd
116034,0,t3_1vbjlh,That ignores the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage.  Lets say minimum wage goes up to  an hour.  Thats great for all of those who are able to keep their jobs and get the  per hour.  They will have more money to spend and will do so.  Thus there is more velocity if you look only at their part.To see the net overall effect you must examine the entire picture.  When the minimum wage goes to  per hour you have made it so that workers who cannot product  per hour of value will not have jobs.  Employers will not employ people who cannot at a minimum cover their costs of employment.  Thus you cut out a much larger pool of money that subtracts from the velocity.  Velocity will decrease having the opposite effect.  Like most Keynsian ideas.,austrian_economics,cern6nk,2,t5_2stjd

5364449,0,t1_cvx7jkv,I believe there are plenty of lurkers in this sub youre in good company.gt Prices are not determined only by the cost of production vs the demand for products but also by competition.A money price is an exchange ratio. To say hamburgers have a price of five dollars is to say that hamburgers at least now in this case are actively exchanged for five dollars. The only reason hamburgers trade for any dollars at all is due to other participants valuing hamburgers and demanding them to be exchanged. The fact that hamburgers fetch five dollars instead of four or six dollars reflects that market actors are willing to part with five dollars for them and no more. This is due to the marginal utility of dollars their individual supply of dollars corresponding to the total supply of dollars the marginal utility of hamburgers unique to each person the reservation demand of the person selling hamburgers how much does the chef desire to keep his burgers either for consumption or speculating on their future price and of course his own marginal utility of money how much money the chef has. A change in any of these will change the resultant price of the good. With all these in flux lets say a hamburger stabilizes at five dollars this afternoon.This price is determined in the midst of competition. Even a monopolist hamburger seller faces competition from other uses of dollars. Hamburger joints compete with television stations diesel pumps gumball machines and every other product capable of being purchased with dollars including other hamburger joints not to mention hot dog kiosks ice cream trucks etc. In this sense there is no way of describing a competitionless scenario. We must return to some state of barter on a desert island to imagine a scenario in which there is no competition for the goods another person carries and therefore the seller of another good can charge exorbitant or infinite prices or something.gt Absent competition the profitmaximizing point on even nonessential goods like say cookies would likely be higher than it is via competition.In a strong sense of competition this is true. If there are multiple hamburger joints all clamoring for customers and each one of them is willing to give more surplus to his customers than his competitors are this producer will win most of the business. He must either do this by reducing his costs and also his prices for his customers or delivering a superior product for the same cost which really amounts to making a new good for a new price. Each hamburger operator will see that the opportunity costs for his customers is reduced when there are alternative burger joints. Not only need they haggle with Jim now they can go to Gary or Bob. Jim recognizing such a situation reduces his own reservation demand which was formed by identifying his product as scarce in some relevant sense and therefore worth holding onto until higher prices are offered as he sees Gary and Bob willing to sell their hamburgers and a race to costs emerges. One undercuts the other and the other undercuts more etc. until a point is reached where customers are not willing to shop around to save the difference and producers are able to make an economic profit that is a profit including implicit opportunity costs. This tends to settle at some rate above the material costs of the operation and it is in such cases where people believe competition reduces prices to costs.gt This is because competition pushes prices down the curve closer to a profit neutral point essentially making industries less profitable.I wouldnt put it quite that way. I would say instead that in all industries which compete for the same money a Uniformity of Profit Principle tends to emerge where the profit levels in various industries change and shift to reflect the underlying opportunity costs. Large profits in hamburger production will entice capital and labor from media production railroad maintenance softserve ice cream dispensing laundromat banking and every other industry until the supply offered is saturated and the producers find themselves bidding down their prices until the rate of profit they earn is roughly commensurate to what anyone would earn in any other industries even accounting for production in the future which is discounted by the interest rate.gt When costs of production rise the formerly optimal profitmaximizing point with competition considered is no longer profitable and companies must raise prices or go out of business.This is correct but it ignores why costs should rise. If costs rise it is because those very same material goods beef bread vegetables grills kiosks etc. are demanded more urgently elsewhere. The hamburger producer must raise his prices signifying to his customers that hamburgers are now more expensive to make relative to the other things those materials could make whether the cost increase is due to a shortage of edible cows due to a meat rationing of a war effort or whathaveyou. Again costs are opportunity costs. They are the prices producers of final goods must pay for the intermediate goods grade A beef buns etc..It should be noted however that if costs of production rise in one industry they must necessarily fall in another. More people are demanding these raw materials than ever before so they must be demanding less of some others. This is a result of the fact that prices for finished consumer goods are imputed backwards and adjust the prices for intermediate goods costs of production.gtThis changes the competition pressure as most businesses are forced to raise prices to avoid that though it may reduce profits for the businesses relative to precost increase levels.Whether an increase in costs increases or decreases the producers profit is an open question. If costs are increasing it implies demand for finished goods is increasing whether that is through hamburgers or some other combination of those intermediate goods. If costs are rising due to a rising hamburger demand the producer wont have to do anything. He will be experiencing extra demand that his current price schedule cant handle it would leave him out of stock and so he raises prices of hamburgers to ration off his limited supply. The increased price of hamburgers will manifest in an increased price for meat and buns. If costs are rising through the demand of substitute goods or of goods Jim doesnt control then it implies people are demanding other goods besides Jims hamburgers and unless he is willing to eat the extra cost theres a pun he will probably go out of business. Raising the prices of his own hamburgers would only be shooting himself in the foot. If people are demanding nonhamburgers to the point where they affect the price of his intermediate good when he charges five dollars what will they do when he raises his price  buy more??gt Some will probably go out of business on the leaner profits but others will raise prices to avoid going out of business.The only ones who can effectively raise prices are the ones who experience greater demand for their product. Anyone else who tries to raise prices to work with the newly moreexpensive hamburger parts will simply find himself sliding faster toward shutting down.gt Thus increases in prices from increased cost do not come solely from a reduction in the number of suppliers but in a change in competition as businesses generally are forced to raise prices or lose money.You are confusing a few factors here. Namely that any business forced to raise prices is already making a poor entrepreneurial decision to charge more for relatively unwanted combinations of expensive materials and cannot sustainably continue in business.The introduction of a tax is emphatically not an increase in the cost of production. A hamburger does not become more expensive to manufacture because now the government demands a cut. Jim simply loses some of his profit. If he tries to raise prices to push it off to his consumers he will be raising prices when there has been no change in demand. Now its in the nature of a government tax that such an imposition cannot be avoided for long or for many people. Because its a tax and every hamburger producer must pay it they all get hit with an equal haircut and they all remain at the same rate of profit though obviously they must do with lower absolute amounts. The economics of tax incidence is not the same as the economics of imputation.PS I understand Block and Barnett have challenged Rothbards explanation of the incidence of a general sales tax here but I havent read it yet.,austrian_economics,cvxdan1,2,t5_2stjd
5827823,0,t3_3uzooc,Deflation if managed can be healthy for an economy I think that economists and governments in general worry about deflation as it is much harder to manage via government policy than inflation. When most people say deflation is bad they are talking about great depression style runaway deflation. The government is always worried that any deflation will lead to runaway deflationon a related note in the Usa the fact that we have had  interest rates for so long and have been printing money as such quantity and have had such relatively low inflation year over year shows the huge deflationary pressure on the market. They have been trying to inflate their way out of it but the more they do that the stronger the deflationary pressure gets and the more likely we will have runaway deflation. IMO this shows what can happen if you ignore market forces toward deflation or purposefully try to avoid it by propping up the markets by trying to create massive inflation. ,austrian_economics,cxjjxa2,0,t5_2stjd

9170117,0,t1_d8eb29h,Ah ok.Thats quite simple. Modern governments create money at arms length through a quasiindependent central bank. This process makes the chances of government created inflation lower. Many governments could benefit in the short term from creating money and spending it. The government must get around the central banks bureaucratic in order to do that. Something that will come with significant political cost.Some point to supposed differences between creating reserves in the central banking system and creating money more directly e.g. printing cash. There are no long term gains from the latter method. The state gets to create money ex nihilo and that provides for more spending than doing it indirectly. When inflation rises it must destroy money in the same way though. Correspondingly that costs more than doing it through the central banking system. With a central banking system any long term rise in the demand for money is profit for the government anyway.Read about central bank independence.,austrian_economics,d8edpnd,2,t5_2stjd

10945807,0,t1_de87m2r,As jstock mentions I dont think you understand the entire process.Banks only deal in their own bank accounts. Transactions between banks are always dealt with via reserves.Lets say that I borrow K from my bank. The bank simply enters K in its account database alongside my name. To maintain the reserve ration it must obtain a small quantity of reserves if it doesnt already have enough.Now very soon afterwards I will spend the balance. When people borrow money they generally spend it straight away on an asset and that asset is the loan collateral. I may buy a house for example.At that stage the bank must make a transfer to another bank. So my bank will pay K to another bank. Banks usually do not bank with each other. So the second bank will demand reserves. Reserves which are fiat money created by the central bank that is equivalent to cash so called base or outside money. Notice this is not a reciprocal arrangement its not borrowing its handing over base money. At this stage the first bank have two things on their balance sheet. The have the loan arrangement they have made. This is an asset a stream of earnings. They have paid for that asset with the reserves that they handed over to the other bank.Once the second bank have the reserves they can do what they want with them. They can create loans and so on. However the quantity of reserves that the second  bank has obtained is offset by the quantity that the first one has lost.,austrian_economics,de8zdw1,1,t5_2stjd
