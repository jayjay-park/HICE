5925999,0,t3_3wgotq,This was a pretty good map but I feel like putting two fat guys next to each other in the first floor was kind of a dick move especially when playing as Alex and Ash. The gameplay was really solid on the second floor though.,hotlinemiamimaps,cxwfh28,2,t5_37fva
6012156,0,t3_3xt4fn,The topmost staircase on the first map somehow walked me outside the map and got me stuck. Check your level transitions there. Also double check your level transition arrows so theyre accurately telling you whether youre going up a floor or down as I think some are wrong.Personally I like wide open blind fire maps so I thought the first map was great. I havent played the other ones yet so Ill try to later.I hear you on the cutscene stuff. I havent figured out much beyond making a clickable NPC.,hotlinemiamimaps,cy7q0un,1,t5_37fva

6166902,0,t3_3zuaci,Well it depends on how the map was made it seems to happen when the enemy pathing is fucked up. Say for example you place down an enemy to patrol but instead he gets stuck and freaks out like they do in the main game when it first game out where they rotate so fast that they look like theyre displaying two sprites at once.So its not really a problem you can fix unless you find the enemy thats glitching out or is stuck.,hotlinemiamimaps,cyqm2ho,1,t5_37fva

6501901,0,t3_44p1n7,ProsGreat dialogue which fits into the story if noncanon.st level was very HLM styled.Some levels shown the set.There are scenes that you walk around and has characters.Martin talks for once and others see his state of mind.ConsMovie plot is never talked about except for the rape scene I suggest adding some of the cast going over stuff lines setting etc.Strip club level is basically a copy of Push It try to be inspired by it NOT ENTIRELY COPY IT.Enemies werent that varied fatties I saw like...st level felt short...thats it.,hotlinemiamimaps,czrug9f,2,t5_37fva

6949302,0,t1_d14103o,Yeah I decided to go for a clean good looking level that could feel like a real lab so I didnt use AKs or Shotguns there is a way of gettig a Silenced Uzi and a drill tho.The Phil mask is there because it kinda fits with the whole underwater theme I thought about using Charlie but I prefer Phils clean mask design.,hotlinemiamimaps,d1419w1,1,t5_37fva

7228194,0,t3_4efkxs,Guess all I can say is its a ok lsd level just the colombian enemys going under the corpsesblood etc leads to cheap deaths more a fault on the games part if anything. With lsd enemys thisd be really goodstill good ambitious first post,hotlinemiamimaps,d1zsier,1,t5_37fva
7379956,0,t3_4gesmg,This is might the best level i ever played. The only complain i have is that you can go outside the level on the last floor And the russian picking up the boxes keeps repeating his animation.,hotlinemiamimaps,d2h1tk1,1,t5_37fva
