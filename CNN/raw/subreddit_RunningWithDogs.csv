565828,0,t1_cg45sxt,I have a lurcherrottweiler cross and a staffie cross they are both pretty well built dogs  Tom the lurcher is incredibly strong but a bit daft in the head. Giving him an actual job to do might be really good for him. Also he produces frankly copious amounts of dunnies on his runs itd be lovely if I didnt have to carry them!,RunningWithDogs,cg4l987,2,t5_30yil
646933,0,t1_cgd6hw4,did he run funny at all initially? I heard sometimes it can be like us trying to run in flippers... I havent bought anything for my girl yet still trying to figure out if I need to living in the South. ,RunningWithDogs,cgdt1ml,1,t5_30yil
800897,0,t3_233o9e,My pup is a puller as well and I use a Halti. I see that you think it may create force when she stops but I dont think it will. It just pulls their head sideways not backwards or down and that is why I like it. I keep Pipers loose enough so that she can slip out of it easily too but the way its designed is that when they pull it tightens up. I really like mine its made Piper a better walker and runner!  ,RunningWithDogs,cgvbcti,3,t5_30yil

3343367,0,t1_cp936ag,Congrats  one question for you.  If the dog decides its time for pit stop during the race do you grab a baggy clean up and finish?  Not sure the etiquette in that situation.And good job on the PR,RunningWithDogs,cp9da5x,3,t5_30yil

4411063,0,t3_3bizlo,Thats adorable! My boxer is  months old and Im to wait until hes a year to run with him as per my vet. Ive never seen that dog tired but Im hopeful running will be the key!,RunningWithDogs,csmv0vv,2,t5_30yil
4802766,0,t3_3gmdjo,We took our year old border colliegolden retriever mix on an mile loop hike that went up  Adirondack High Peaks and took nearly  hours. We still joke about how we almost killed the dog but he made it without too much issue. Our pics from the top of Mt Marcy are kinda hilarious  smiling humans standing over dead dog  that I didnt realize looked so bad until after the hike! That said Zephyr is super fit trail runs about  miles or more a week with us and loves being outdoors. He was conditioned to do the hike beforehand. Still...we were pushing it with the distance and demanding climbs. Hikes lately are more like  if they involve big climbs and all day action! If your dog is fit and conditioned to the activity...and youre aware of how hes feeling better than we were! Im sure hell love the fun!,RunningWithDogs,ctzxfrt,2,t5_30yil

7008063,0,t1_d173tei,UPDATE We usually run in the afternoon I work pmam so we tried running in the morning am for  mins and instead of running our usual route we reversed the way we run it from left to right to right to left. It worked! The run improved greatly. There are less dogs in the streets and we are on the side of the houses with less dogs. Though the barking still persists my dog pulls less often than our first try. Cant wait for him to stop pulling completely. Thanks!,RunningWithDogs,d1apjtp,2,t5_30yil

7034154,0,t1_d1dl5n4,We only mountain bike together and i only take him to trails that he can run off leash. I had to have him on the leash for  minutes to get to a trail one time and he almost pulled me off my bike. ,RunningWithDogs,d1dodeg,2,t5_30yil
7107351,0,t1_d1ksdnp,As long as Ive had her  about . years. Im wondering if as shes gotten older her pads have gotten more dry hence my mushers secret Q. Shes only been cut twice. The last one made her  legged for awhile but she seems ok now. Just makes me nervous  I dont want her on antibiotics a ton for stuff like this...,RunningWithDogs,d1lzs26,2,t5_30yil
7282972,0,t3_4f3505,Congratulations!!! When did you guys start running together how old was he? And how does he deal with the heat? Mine doesnt want to even walk when its more than  degrees.. ,RunningWithDogs,d260xik,2,t5_30yil

8285899,0,t1_d5d4w1c,I use this one Ive knotted it to make it shorter usually he constantly pulls so we never get tangled. Yesterday as he tired it started to get slack it was actually difficult to manage once it went slack as then it could get under my feet.,RunningWithDogs,d5dao4o,2,t5_30yil
9383149,0,t1_d951cqb,Usually I run him with a waistbelt and fixed  metre leash with a bungee bit its really comfy he generally pulls for the first mile or so then trots happily beside me. Because this was a more exciting trail he was pulling more and parts of the footing were really difficult I was pretty worried about breaking an ankle so I took an extendable so that hed be that much further ahead and I could see my footing more easily plus if he suddenly pulled while I was navigating a tricky downhill I could just let it extend a bit rather than be pulled over and fall into a river. I still carried my usual leash in my backpack as a backup Im always suspicious extendables will snap and used that when we got onto easier trail near the end.,RunningWithDogs,d95dp61,1,t5_30yil
9753462,0,t1_dafbir4,My GSD was good in general.  If she saw something like a rabbit she would look at me first to get permission to chase it.  We were on a trail running when a deer jumped the trail and kept running my dog gave chase.  I called her she was zooming after that deer.  So I shocked her once nothing happened I turned up the charge and shocked her again and she stopped the chase and ran back to me she probably figured that darned deer bit her.I know some people are against shock collars.  I think it depends on the dog and situation.  Mine I hardly shocked it had a tone function and that tone function would have my dog look to me for her next command.  So if she was far in the field and I needed her to go right or left or come back wait  or bring me something or get something I could activate the tone she would look to me for a hand signal and then carry out that action.  It allowed distant communication without the need for a whistle or yelling.  The funny thing is SHE taught me how to use the tone.  I tried training her that the tone meant come.  instead she taught me that the tone meant I look at you.  Then I could give her a hand command.  It worked out better in the long run because I gained more communication than if the tone only meant come.My current dogs dont use an electric collar.  Neither of them have the temperament or utility for it. The one dogs recall is just not up to par.  he does not take commands like my GSD did.  The other dog well his recall is pretty good but he gets into stuff like he would probably try to eat a dead deer as fast as possible before he came back to me so neither are trusted off leash.,RunningWithDogs,dafbyhn,2,t5_30yil
9767302,0,t1_dagnb2l,Sure! Heres a fewThe shelter she came from as a puppy had her tagged as a boxer mix but I just call her a black mouth cur which describes her better. We dont know anything about her parents or litter mates. Shes basically reddishbrown all over except her muzzle and about  lbs.,RunningWithDogs,dah1c0d,1,t5_30yil

11538547,0,t1_dg3v1ic,I havnt had much success honestly. I keep him close and always strongly tell him no. I try and reward him if he is being friendly from afar and if he starts growling i dont let him get close. Its not the best method by any means but i dont have the money for a behavioralist or trainer or anything,RunningWithDogs,dg3waam,3,t5_30yil
