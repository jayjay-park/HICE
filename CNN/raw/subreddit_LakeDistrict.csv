10487042,0,t3_5pve02,No need to apologise youre helping me. We havent yet decided where to stay we figured itd make more sense to pick an area where we want to hike first then find accommodation as close to there as possible. Well have a car so can drive if need be. We havent really done any scrambles. There were a couple of parts of the Snowdon climb which may be considered scrambles that is if my understanding of the term is correct in that it involves a steeper incline where you need to use your hands but these were probably considered very easy. In terms of pushing ourselves I guess the definition can vary. We dont mind a bit of a challenge but to be honest I think wed rather lean towards a more leisurely route than one that might end up being too difficult for our experienceabilityfitness. ,LakeDistrict,dcwtdd0,1,t5_301av
