778271,0,t1_cgsg334,Yeah I was feeling smug and thought I can survive a hit or two. ,DCSStourney,cgsqs5u,1,t5_2tkwx
797680,0,t1_cgu3hqv,Nice work WestofHouse! I better get in some wins before you totally show me up.,DCSStourney,cguy6ri,1,t5_2tkwx
3361433,0,t3_2yn8au,Im in CAO often under the moniker Orph.I do have a win under my belt and I will probably reuse MfSk as its an easy class to win with. Had one  rune run that died because i forgot restoration potions when dealing with Pan.,DCSStourney,cpbffjx,1,t5_2tkwx
5757392,0,t1_cx9yhu5,Do you have any won games? I can just watch them on termcast.develz.org.,DCSStourney,cxarcfr,1,t5_2tkwx

7518608,0,t1_d2wls2g,Yeah it is and yeah I do. Does it not show me as part? Im not sure what Im suppsoed to be looking at there. Thats like the overall tourney stats right?,DCSStourney,d2wtubs,1,t5_2tkwx
7569488,0,t1_d32gbol,Welp I feel at least partly to blame for this. I generally ignore ice caves without rC for this reason.,DCSStourney,d32m3y2,1,t5_2tkwx
7602631,0,t1_d36dbk1,. or something was half damage this time double damage? p,DCSStourney,d36dov4,2,t5_2tkwx
7615115,0,t1_d37rzyc,The real problem is that I have no chance against an OOF right now. The goal would be to ditch Oka for Zin and wait his wrath out in CryptTombHell.,DCSStourney,d37sron,1,t5_2tkwx
7753445,0,t1_d3mpyu7,Congratulations! I knew you could do it!With this rate of progress you will be casually tabbing through pan lords in no time. Keep it up!,DCSStourney,d3nibqm,1,t5_2tkwx
9526223,0,t1_d9nai0w,Ive done it offline before but I always was too scared to try it during the tournament because I always wanted to get the win points. There were close shaves but this run was pretty smooth...I will try it again sometime maybe with Monkarias methods for DD ,DCSStourney,d9nb410,1,t5_2tkwx
9696055,0,t1_da80xov,I love Yred! I really wish I had my bone dragon corps when I got to Zot I am going to modify my V strategy to NOT accidentally walk downstairs with my crew!.The meatshields and bardiche combination is really one of the best ways to fight OOF without getting malmutated. With bone dragons I imagine I would have just rolled.My other regret was losing an early Frances enslaved soul and later Frederick. Their summons especially Frances made things a mess! Frances in Orcish Mines was total chaos and a fun run.,DCSStourney,da88tfd,1,t5_2tkwx
