11395208,0,t3_62hz6i,Its not going to be a bad saw. Its not going to be good one either. If  is the top end of your budget than this is the saw for you. You wont find a better one at that price. Just be aware the fence is probably going to give you trouble. If you need precision cuts than you will be needing to clamp down a make shift fence by hand. I ran a cheap ridgid saw for a few years doing just that before I stepped up to a big boy.  ,woodworkingtools,dfnmqi2,1,t5_362md
