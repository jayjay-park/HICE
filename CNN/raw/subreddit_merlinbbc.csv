4634576,0,t3_3ed05k,Its a show about MAGIC and you get bothered by a black character? Its medieval times yet the guys dont have beards but you get bothered by a black character with a nose??. Merlin is supposed to be old and frankly writing down everything they changed would take too long. To make it short The creators made their own version of the legend though the most important things have stayed the same. Why does it matter what skin color characters have like that does not make any difference. Also part of the reason why Guinevere would usually be described as pale not a lot of sunlight is due to the fact that royalty did not go outside they did not have to because they had their people doing work outside and they themselves stayed inside their big castle all day long wherefore wealthy and royal people back in the day had lighter skin than others. Aside from that it does not have any influence on the character herself. Like I said almost everything is different its a retelling and a really good one. If you get bothered by skin color of one character go take a good look at yourself and ask yourself how you have come to the point where you need to make a post about being uncomfortable by a very VERY small part of the cast not being white.,merlinbbc,cter9vh,0,t5_2s3xe
8838079,0,t3_517gkl,The finale episodes grew to be my favourites it just took me some time to stop being so wrecked by it which was tough as the finale  aired ON CHRISTMAS. As unlikely as it may be I am really hoping a modern day Netflix continuation happens one day as well. I am glad to see other people asking about one...CMON NETFLIX EVEN JUST  MORE EPISODE ...or lots...pls,merlinbbc,d7a7ndp,3,t5_2s3xe
