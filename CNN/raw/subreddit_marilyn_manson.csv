3704593,0,t3_2yl1sd,I guess this is a slightly moot discussion now but I am addicted to this album in a way I havent been since Mechanical Animals. Unlike the OP I always found MM a caricature  I dont know what brought me to Mechanical Animals but I remember just being blown away artistry. Anyway  TPE absolutely rocks. Cant shock forever. ,marilyn_manson,cqejr60,1,t5_2tgik

5444517,0,t3_3pmmls,When I saw him the crowd got really crazy at parts. Girls trying to get on stage and girls ripping their clothing off. People shoving others to get closer to him. Manson cut open his arm or hand cant remember with a glass bottle.. Get there early because lines will form. But then again he has not been in Alabama in a long time so it was packed. He was really crowd interactive and I love when musicians do that. Here is the setlist from when I saw him.,marilyn_manson,cw7l8gz,2,t5_2tgik

9565501,0,t1_d9s4a9f,Well Manson has said that he can do as many controversial things as he pleases but he sees no point if he isnt saying anything new or provocative. So if burning a Quran proves a point hes making then Im obviously not opposed but the act itself already carries a heavy meaning. I think its out of place to make such a statement without making a statement. But who knows it is after all a promo video. ,marilyn_manson,d9s56tg,2,t5_2tgik

9639089,0,t3_5cy5ry,His appearances on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher are the best specifically the one where Lakita Davis is attempting to make him the villain but he ultimately exposes her hypocrisy.  Also the Space Ghost interview is awesome. If you havent seen it you need to watch it.,marilyn_manson,da17smh,7,t5_2tgik
9747821,0,t3_5eqhso,Thats awesome.   For a second before I clicked the link I was hoping it was a new reissue.   Good on ya though!   I recently bought a copy of it on cassette because it was only  bucks and scoring the vinyl is a tough tough thing.   ,marilyn_manson,daemqis,6,t5_2tgik

10779776,0,t1_ddrs2dg,Manson isnt following him on twitter. I checked at the time of this reply Honestly have no idea when he unfollowed or if he followed to begin with tho I assumed he did but I dont think his following count has changed in the past view days so im not sure Twiggy still follows him tho,marilyn_manson,ddrut7k,4,t5_2tgik
10798852,0,t3_5ughh8,Anger is a stage a grief that many of us are likely already passed. Ive accepted that there might even not be a new album and am just enjoying talking with other fans now.,marilyn_manson,ddttos7,1,t5_2tgik
10833362,0,t1_ddshf29,Ill be posting some clips on YouTube soon. I will post a link here if I remember. Its definitely a David Lynch inspired project but Im sure some Manson fans would enjoy it because its very avantgarde in the sense that Phantasmagoria was meant to be. But its a one of a kind film in that its possibly the first one man feature film I direct star film edit soundtrack etc. so thats kind of my marketing angle. ,marilyn_manson,ddxdvdr,1,t5_2tgik

10869183,0,t1_de0v8be,I fucking loved it from first listen. Its experimental pop at its finest. I know not everyone liked it when it released but it reminded me of Radiohead when they dropped Kid A after OK Computer. Everyone was taken by surprise at the shift in sound. Frank Ocean imo dropped one of the best albums of the decade so far.,marilyn_manson,de12uls,2,t5_2tgik

10877456,0,t3_5ver5m,The High End of Low is easily my second favorite album by MM. my first being MA. Ive been a fan only since  or so.  years. Im I guess you can say part of the newer fans of his. I was born in  right when he was starting  down in Ft Lauderdale. But man THEOL really made me feel something. Every time I listen to it it takes me back to a point in my life that I related so much to that album. I remember when he premiered it on MySpace.com or whatever and I heard Devour and had it on repeat. Its such a masterpiece to me. I love every single track especially his fuck this fucking bullshit attitude on AGDMFG and his crazy I cut myself  times for every time Evan didnt answer my phone calls for IWTKYLTDITM. The interviews in that era were some of his best and most revealing also I just turn into such a fanboy for  Marilyn Manson. I think everyone else doesnt care about it as much as I do,marilyn_manson,de1xkin,3,t5_2tgik

10901847,0,t3_5vrnw8,Not a fan seems tryHardish. In both imagery bland dudes and a knife so edgy and lyrics.  She has potential and I am curious about the effort with Tyler.  Manson is one of a kind he is explosively abnormal and against the grain but doesnt feel like hes trying to hard certainly at times thats the best part. Manson is fucked through and through. He doesnt ever come home to a normal life. Edit Her other music drives me nuts. Horrible lyrics and stupid gangster wrist flicks saying shit about crashing bitches.  Give me a break.   She needs a lot of direction and a song writer. ,marilyn_manson,de4g50v,12,t5_2tgik
