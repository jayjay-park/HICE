1683089,0,t3_2dn99t,Everyone is giving you the overview so I guess Ill hit on some interesting points in Jags history. We first made the playoffs because of a missed  yard FG by Morten Andersen arguably the best kicker of all time Until this year the Jags have always had a good RB or two Natrone Means James Stewart Fred Taylor MJD In the same vein we havent had good WRs since Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell Our lone Franchise QB was Mark Brunell who last played for the Jags in  Our victory over the Dolphins in the playoffs in   was the biggest margin of victory in a playoff game in the Super Bowl Era as well as the most points scored. Both Jimmy Johnson and Dan Marino retired after that game. Fuck the Titans Jags fans were spoiled by early success which imo is why we had a lot of problems with blackouts and filling the seats when we were terrible in the Gene Smith Era There is a lot of hope and faith put into our new FO and coach some of it because they seem to be very good some because there wasnt really anything good to say about the jags for a long timeI realistically expect us to go about  or  this season but I think we will surprise a lot of people with how much we have improved. All of us Jags fans are very hopeful for the future of the franchise as the vast majority think that the FO and Gus are doing a lot of things right for growing our brand and of course playing good football.,Jaguars,cjrbeac,2,t5_2s4u2
1708943,0,t3_2dvzda,I think part of the reason they grabbed him was to add a familiar face and easier transition for Bortles. Someone he already has chemistry with. Thats a good enough reason alone to keep him and was a smart reason to pick him up.,Jaguars,cjukobx,2,t5_2s4u2

1933984,0,t3_2gs6c0,They took over a team that was bottom of the barrel in talent. Its too early to judge but it seems like Dave has a decent eye for talent. I like both drafts and free agency has been pretty good with the likes of Alan Ball Will Blackmon SenDerrick Marks Red Bryant and Chris Clemons. Jury is still out on Toby.I really like Gus style and enthusiasm. He has made some questionable ingame decisions this year but for now Ill chalk that up as nd year bumps. Hes a coach Id love to lead this franchise to success but results are what matter and the first two games have been poor. We still have  games to go and well see how they improve. I wouldnt say his seat is warm but at the end of next year we better be in contention for a wildcard or division title.Its hard to evaluate Jedd. He hasnt had very good QBs that allowed him to open up the playbook. Hes shown some interesting sparks but he has also had some plays that made me scratch my head.Im hoping the Oline comes together and when Bortles comes in he continues with what he has shown in preseason. I think how this year plays out will give us a better idea of what the coaching staff is capable of.EDIT As to the whole QB issue Gus isnt going to show a lack of confidence in Chad while hes the starter. Its all coach speak. Im in the camp that would like a switch now  but Bortles will be starting sooner rather than later I believe.,Jaguars,ckm8cfn,1,t5_2s4u2

But theres nothing that can be done there just try to show improvement each week.Hurns came out and made some ridiculous plays on the ball. I hope he can keep up that level of play and not fade away next week as long as we have to force throws then we need guys like Hurns to use their size to win the ball.The rest of the WRs just looked lackluster. Nobody is really helping Blake out least of all Jedd Fisch. Like a screen pass on st and  right after the kickoff when youre probably not going to get blitzed? I dont get it. The Gus Bus needs to kick a few passengers off Jedd Fisch being one. And why did we even bother drafting Marqise Lee?The defense overall played a lot better but its unbelievable how prone they are to giving up huge plays. Josh Evans is getting exposed and that FS spot is one that I definitely think will be upgraded in FA or the draft. Telvin Smith had an awful game but I still think hes got the potential at WLB.Special teams I dont even know man.Overall need more consistency on offense in the passing game while playing less conservatively need to not give up stupid huge plays on defense. But the defense played overall a lot better and the running game has never looked better and thats heartening.

The second year he spent much of the offseason rehabilitating his injury rather than preparing and building muscle for the season. This year he needs to step it up.

Maybe you dont see him transitioning to the LEO and thats fine although he most certainly is athletic enough. I could understand not wanting him because of the failed drug test. But there was nothing you saw to persuade you he could rush the passer effectively? I think we watched different videos. Gregory demonstrated a swim    and a power move   when he simply destroys Erick Flowers off the snap. He was also able to work back inside. He exhibited a relentless tenacity that you love to see in EDGE rushers. Most of the video was about the run to refute the critique he was slow off the snap.,Jaguars,cq29iwz,2,t5_2s4u2

4774745,0,t1_ctwca31,I dont really. The key for our team isnt even acquiring talent right now its getting the talent we have to perform at a higher level. High draft picks top  mainly but most first rounders and some high seconds are meant to step in and start and fill an immediate hole. I dont think the Jags even HAVE that glaring hole right now. You dont want a top  pick to spend on depth or even a replacement for someone like Poz. If Luke Joeckel doesnt work than another great LT pick would be nice but we just need contributors. Not saying we couldnt use the pick. Every team even Seattle and New England could start a top  pick somewhere on their team. But if you mean to suggest we need that to succeed I disagree. ,Jaguars,ctwedpm,3,t5_2s4u2

4987836,0,t3_3j8q9s,Basic basic basic overview Jags formed in  alongside the Carolina Panthers. For a few glory years right out of the gate they were a competitive team with Mark Brunell as QB. They had a great rivalry with the Steelers.  Then they sucked. Then during the mid to late s they were pretty good again. This was when Maurice Jones Drew was crushing it.  Then they sucked.  Current Jags are a really young team a lot of players are just nd year guys. Im pretty hyped about the future of the franchise. Weve got a great front office with Shad Khan Dave Caldwell and Gus Bradley leading the team in the right direction. Bortles first season was a tire fire for a lot of reasons but throughout the season the team showed flashes of great potential.  Now this upcoming season is starting and Im pretty pumped after the first three preseason games and training camp etc. Bortles looks to have taken a big step forward not only in mechanics but also in confidence and leadership.  Basically its an exciting time to become a fan. The team has a ton of potential and were in a pretty weak division minus the Colts so I wouldnt be surprised to see us take a leap to second in the division within the next year or so and then become a legit continuous playoff contender in the next  years.,Jaguars,cun7wbb,7,t5_2s4u2

5355268,0,t1_cvw5v20,Ive been a fan since you could be a fan of the Jaguars. I have merch that I bought before the Jags played a single down. I was  years old when I went to my first game. I watched us put a period on Marinos career. I watched the Jagwads kick sand on a Super Bowl favorite Broncos team. I saw them make it to two AFC championships in the first five years of being a team. I also watched us spend the years after Coughlin making draft picks that would make all but the biggest CFB fans ask Who? I watched us run Maurice JonesDrew ragged. I defended Leftwich. I defended Del Rio. I tricked myself into getting excited about Matt Jones. I told myself Its not so bad. Were just in the same division as Peyton Manning. His career cant last forever. Now hes gone and were still bad. I told myself Its not so bad. We just havent found our franchise QB yet. Now we have one and were still bad. I told myself Its not so bad. We just dont have any offensive weapons. Now we have two receivers and a RB poised to have breakout seasons and were still bad. The Jaguars have been my team for as long as Ive been old enough to have a team. Ive been hopeful and optimistic and excited for  years. Im done. I wont be watching another game until Gus Bradley is shopping his resume. ,Jaguars,cvw72gp,15,t5_2s4u2

7131849,0,t1_d1or7z2,Im by no means an expert but an issue I see is that we have quality starters around the team with little depth in many key places.     Amukamara is oft injured and played behind Rodgers cromartie his whole career against s. We still dont have a shut down Corner but maybe we dont need one.    We signed beachum for our tackle position and have  quality players at tackle now. And for guard we have linder Cann and bowako is a good depth guy to have. But maybe one more versatile OL player would be nice.    I just dont think we have a need for WR at all with Robinson Hurns Lee Greene Walters and sterling on the PS and Id think we could address other needs with any pick we have.    Ok maybe I was wrong about TE but Lewis is still decent and Nic Jacobs is a good rd guy. I also expect Koyack to make the roster and he showed promise last preseason.    Youre right about the LB depth the only decent backup we had was Jordan Tripp.    Youre right about Edge rusher.

The value of those those first two picks was inflated because they were quarterbacks. Think when the Dolphins moved up from  to  to get Dion Jordan. The Raiders only got a second round pick for compensation. When the target is not a QB GMs are more conservative and trades are a little bit more down to earth.

7393746,0,t1_d2ijdgc,We started from scratch.  There was not a single position that you looked at that was good.  Now youre talking about the only positions that are a true need is interior line and pass rush.As far as teams not drafting on need Quarterback was not a need for Tennessee last year but they took Mariota anyway.  Leonard Williams was absolutely not a need for the Jets last year at .  Trae Williams to the Vikings was no pressing need with them having Terreace Newman and Xavier Rhodes.  Andrus Peat to New Orleans was about as pressing a need as Tunsil to Jacksonville would be.  I just gave you  in the first  last year.  But its moot we have  needs.   Pass Rush and Interior Line.  Im among those that dont think theres anyone at  who can help the pass rush without being a huge reach.  Theres certainly no interior lineman though Tunsil could help that position.  The roster has been constructed so there are no glaring needs but there arent any major strengths besides QB and WR. If all things are equal and youre looking at  roughly similiarly tiered players yeah you take the one that fits the need.  Beyond that you take the upside and the upside with Tunsil is being one of the best lineman in football.,Jaguars,d2imbod,2,t5_2s4u2

8398775,0,t3_4uo7fg,. SenDerrick Marks. I actually think placing Malik in front of Marks in the rotation will open the game up a bit for SenDerrick. He can be really productive in a situational role especially with some speed on the field. Hell also have a better opportunity to stay healthy.. Im not sure there will be any surprises but one that might surprise a lot of fans would be Bryan Walters. Four receiver roster spots are set in stone right now for the most part. Walters will likely be the fifth. Still hes kinda redundant with Greene on the roster and there are quite a few camp guys like Benn gunning for that th spot. An unknown WR flashes every training camp and well soon find out who thatll be this year. Could the flash be enough to take Walters spot? . Linder and Ramsey. Bortles third center in three years but this center is a proven inside presence. Cant wait to watch the BortlesLinder chemistry unfold. As for Ramsey Im just excited to see him play. He carries a fire around that Jaguars dont usually carry. He might not be a worldbeater in his rookie year but damn hell be exciting. ,Jaguars,d5re68j,2,t5_2s4u2

Myles Jack looks to be on the fast track to his rightful starting spot at Mike Linebacker and leader of the defense. Hayes Pullard III keeps showing up on the stat sheet left and right both on offense and defense. And while his failure to report on his TD catch drastically changed the momentum in he game it still showed that the offense is capable of putting in the body of work to get the job done provided we dont shoot ourselves in the foot.Corey grant reassured everyone who will be returning kicks this season for us.Blake showed multiple times that his ability to pass accurately whilst running for his life is second to nice. He actually seems to throw a better ball on the move than sitting comfy in the pocket.There are a bunch more bright spots underneath the thick coat of cat feces that was left on the field in the first half but my absolute favorite is that the Albino Tiger went yet another game avoiding the injury report.

They have to win  of those  and also sweep the Titans tough and Colts not tough. This would put the Jags at  wins would need to win  against Texans to get to  and maybe win the division.    Ultimately this falls on Gus being able to prepare the team to exploit other teams weaknesses. Raiders cant cover TEs. Bears have no QB. Bills are hot and cold on both sides of the ball. Lions are weird and find ways to lose. Mariotta and Osweiller are inconsistent. Chiefs will be tough because Alex Smith but hes not been that stellar this year.,Jaguars,d8f1v5u,1,t5_2s4u2

No everyone knows he has regressed but can fix his rout running a footwork. Same goes for Hurns. But Blake is a bust? You dont go from what he was last year a stud gunslinger who needed better decision making to a bust in a single season. His decision making is better this year a lot better. But his mechanics has regressed. That can be fixed. Give him a coach that will bring out the best in him. Showcase his strengths and play towards that. Something that has yet to be done. At the very least even if you hate him you have to admit that theres not a QB in the draft or this years FA that will be better than him. Hes has always been a work in progress with a huge upside if hes developed. I think that hayley or another strong minded offensive coach can show us at the very least a franchise QB. Coach killer?? Hes had one HC and a group of aweful play calling. I still think we can have this years stout defence with improved and developed players with an improved version of last years big play offence with better play calling and hard work for Blake.

The get a veteran and let them compete plan isnt realistic if you think theres a chance Blake turns it around you go with him. If you dont you ditch him get a veteran option that wont cost a high pick. Either way I think you try and get a guy you think can develop.

As one might expect this was harmful for wee uTheSwellFellows health and his brain was irreparably harmed. When yours truly was born the Jaguars were not godawful. In fact they werent even mediocre. They were pretty damn good. And there isnt much to be proud of in Jacksonville aside from Lynyrd Skynyrd who like the dreams of Jaguars fans crashed and burned so my parents got me some cute Jaguars apparel and sent me to some games. Hometown pride! Ol Markey Mark Brunel was slinging the ball Jimmy Smith was having a hell of a party on and off the field... life was good for the Jaguars. A little while later my family moved away from Jacksonville. I spent my formative years in Charlotte giving me ample time to jump the ship to the Panthers. I did adopt the Panthers as a team but they have been the B to my A for all this time. I never jumped ship completely and I think its because I kinda like the pain.

11116066,0,t3_5ypj2d,Not a long term answer but lets be honest Bortles was a project coming out... what better way to let a guy learn and get motivated than Romo? Bortles strikes me a guy that does better when underrated anyways as he showed getting minimal commits coming out of HS to play QB and showing out to win the Orange Bowl for the fucking UCF Knights. I dont care either way honestly. They still have  mil in cap room the money isnt even an issue.
