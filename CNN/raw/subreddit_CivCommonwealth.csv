234976,0,t3_1wovbw,Sorry it took awhile Ive been sick with a really bad virus. Mt. SteelforgeThe coords for the peak are X  Y  Z There are actually abandoned npc villages growing on the mountain and around it and some very surreal sights there. The base of the mountain is a rough rocky plateau which is where I am in the screenshot that jets up into a massive steep mountain and tampers off into some floating islands nearby.Ive explored quite a few ice mountains looking for a higher example but I havent found any since I joined.If you would like to help out with it or just visit try not to leave pillars of cobble to the peak or damage the mountain.,CivCommonwealth,cf53sf2,2,t5_2x7jc

412588,0,t3_1yrxei,Few things to go over with city security.We need to consolidate the snitch networks.       We have  networks consolidate them to one. We need to remove private snitches unless its YOUR individual property.        That being said I dont want LADS having their network or any       other individuals networks around the city. We will give them access in times of need or decide to give them permanent access.The doors need to go     I love the doors and will continue making private tunnels. But to revamp the population in the city with visitors trade and residents the doors have to come down. Let the few people who have literally kept CW going take over control of it. The only reason it was really that large of a city to begin with was because of the small group of individuals that increased the flow of diamonds through the city.CW is a valuable hub. We have  major railways that all meet in CW. The old government is inactive and look where its gotten us as of right now. We also need to redo the sub. ,CivCommonwealth,cfnj442,1,t5_2x7jc

2002784,0,t1_ckuhe5y,Im still not convinced that even having this sort of government is a good idea. a its organized by someone who doesnt even play but has this as some sort of experimental dream in which we are subjects. not a dig anarcho just sayin b it doesnt improve upon the current system which has proven to be stable over the last six months. The last attempt at this was abandoned because of lack of participation and it looks like youre  on only your second meeting. c it doesnt do anything. Its a video game in which  of your MPs arent even active. Ive yet to see any outline or service that this government could actually provide which are useful. If you want to roleplaycirclejerk some shit then thats cool  but just admit thats what it is. The current borough Lord system works fine. The only relevant powers a government could have would be a security  already covered by the current system via vault owners and pvpers. Those on the snitchvault groups hold all the real power. b public welfare  unnecessary in a world with no scarcity. Virtually everyone gives food away to the needy or provides access to public farms of which we have many.Theres no NEED for a government. Ancapistan here lets people do what they want as long as it doesnt harm anyone else. Lords maintain order in their boroughs. Im not sure theres any demand for a government at all.If anything weve a decent version of Feudalism  with no taxes! Let it ride.The only thing I havent seen is anyone make an argument why having a government at all is a good idea. Anyone? Again if you want to roleplay no problem. Just make that clear to the borough Lords.,CivCommonwealth,ckuj8xw,1,t5_2x7jc
