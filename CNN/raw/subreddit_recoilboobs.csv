981015,0,t3_202p55,Those breasts are slapping around so fast theyd fucking explode. Literally. I did the math.Lets say the bullet isnt particularly fancy and has the muzzle velocity of a typical . rifle. Thats about  ms. In the clip the breast flops a distance of say  cm in the same amount of time it takes the bullet to travel maybe  cm these are rough estimates but you can pick whatever reasonable numbers you like it doesnt matter. If the bullet is moving at  ms then the time it takes the breasts to flop the  cm is . seconds. Since the breasts must flop  cm in that same period of time to avoid getting struck by the bullet that means they experience an average acceleration of A  .t  where t is the . we already figured out. This comes out to  ms which is equivalent to a gforce of ONE MILLION gs...Just to give you an idea of how insane this is... being in a survivable car crash is typically around  gs. The highest recorded gforce ever survived by a human was  gs.A million gs would literally vaporize the breasts.,recoilboobs,chfssq6,89,t5_2za1j
