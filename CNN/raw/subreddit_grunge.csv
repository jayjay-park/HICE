These guys have played major festivals like Lollapalooza Bonnaroo hit the late night circuit with Jay Lenno Jimmy Kimmel David Letterman. Spent years opening up for Kings of Leon so on and so forth.The last thing I would need to do if I were in this band is go the grunge sub reddit and share a song from .

7232873,0,t1_d20b98l,Soundgarden is great and really is a good gateway between mainstream and lesser known in their style. Gotta keep in mind that Soundgarden had been around for a decent amount of time in the scene when the scene was still just a local thing.Metal and punk were both influences on that grunge sound in the beginning. You might really dig the Melvins then they actually have an album or two with Jello Biafra singing for them. TAD was great and their early stuff was very punkmetally inspired. I actually dig their later stuff a little more these days because while the metal edge dulled a bit in one aspect their music was honed and they were more skilled musicians. ,grunge,d20bp9b,2,t5_2r11c

I like the last minute and a half of Rusty cage just because I feel it gets heavier.  The rest is pretty meh.  Although it might not be the best song or even an under rated song but Slaves and Bulldozers is my personal favorite off the album.  That bass line is fucking wicked.   ,grunge,d6520gi,3,t5_2r11c

10959512,0,t3_5v9cq2,I love Nirvana. First band I ever got into on my own. Not that I downvote here but I honestly really get bored by everyone circlejerking over how good they are. Were at a point in musical history where pretty much everyone is familiar with Nirvana. It just feels really low effort and kinda narrowminded to be so focused on them. You dont have to go far to find people who over glamorize them and will only listen to them. Really thats my least favorite thign about any music community  branch out a bit guys.Show me something I dont know that well. Even if I dont like it its much more interesting to hear music that Ive never heard before.,grunge,deae9ne,2,t5_2r11c

11512515,0,t3_646fpg,The problem with post grunge is that it didnt relate to any ongoing social issue or discussion. Grunge worked so well because it connected to a disenchanted stepped on youth. It gave a voice to a overlooked beaten generation that did not have one. Post grunge simply was just pseudoredemptive garbage that was built to be popular. It didnt have meaning which is why nearly all of its music is gone and not cared for anymore whilst the connective and deep grunge music still lives on today. ,grunge,dg0y1nk,1,t5_2r11c
