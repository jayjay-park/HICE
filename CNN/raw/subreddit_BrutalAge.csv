11679168,0,t3_65v5sn,Im pretty new to the game myself but so far my advice would be to try the monster hunter game every time you build up some spears to get some freebies. Always make sure that you dont use your speed up items unless and event is going so you get full rewards for the events and always be using your stamina to hit the highest level monsters you can kill.  The drops can be runes or speed ups or construction hammers building slot  item or any number of other things. Get in a clan any clan. You really need a clan or your open season.Dont bother much now with attacking other players and for a few days only really be researching your growth increases especially construction and research speed. Make sure you sign in every day and clam your sign in reward. Gems are pretty easy to come by once your hitting level  and  monsters reliably so just grind your way up.,BrutalAge,dgjumek,1,t5_3hkla
