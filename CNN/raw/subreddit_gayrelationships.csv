11162538,0,t3_5ptynr,I am a bi male as well and I understand. You have to understand this though  straight men are so gay with each other at times. They get really close that it can seem like they like you and you have seen that with how he treats other guys like he treats you. I have a really good friend who only falls for straight guys and will act the way they do with them the way I described that straight guys act gay with each other because it is close enough for him  he gets to be with them lay on their shoulder wrestlefool around or whatever. They all know he is gay too. But it is extremely unhealthy and sad what he does and he wonders why he cant find a guy. The bottom line is that youre not going to make this straight guy gay no matter how much you love him. I think youre right in giving up with him. I would even suggest staying away from him considering how my friend acts Ive suggested him to stop but he wont. You do not need to cut this friend out of your life  you just need to understand it is not going to happen. You will feel like this again many times  trust me. ,gayrelationships,dex9fp0,1,t5_2v2rt
