2918039,0,t3_2tibe0,Well an easy place to start would be to grab some of the albums youre missing from artists you already have. Namely In Flames. Youve got two albums of their what... ? Maybe if you like their newer stuff work your way back from there. Pick up Come Clarity a personal favourite and Soundtrack to your Escape. Then you can start grabbing some of their best stuff in my opinion  Clayman Colony Whoracle The Jester Race. Great music is in your immediate future!Next up you can scoop up some great Avenged Sevenfold namely City of Evil and their Self Titled. Much better than Nightmare I think.You can scoop up some older Sevendust too. s Animosity and s Seasons are both excellent. Lajons voice really peaks in the earlier years Id say.If you want to try some new bands I think I could put together a list of similar stuff to what you like your albums are a lot like what I had many many years ago. I posted my itunes a few days ago you could take a peek.,ratemymusiclibrary,cnzsfgu,3,t5_361vr
