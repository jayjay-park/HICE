1837202,0,t3_2flweb,Heres a list of options off the top of my headNew Whipped Dog silvertip  depending on options. If you face lather I recommend a  or  sunk to mm. If you can wait about a month and a half the firehouse handles look really nice. Especially if youre getting it drilled deeper if face lathering its only  more and totally worth it. Virginiasheng synthetic. These are super cheap like  on eBay. Ship from China and the knots are crazy good for the price. Almost as good as the Muhle synths which cost x. Of course the handles arent as nice but for twelve damn bucks who cares.  Wetshavingproducts. Heard good things no experience myself. Custom Rudy Vey PAV Brushworks shaverjoe etc. If ordering something new they usually run  for a TGN Finest knot most of the expense is the handle but they look incredible. The TGN isnt quite as soft as WD silvertip but still plenty soft for me when its even the slightest bit wet. These knots have more backbone than WD and are great for face lathering. Sometimes these vendors will also post premade brushes for sale a bit cheaper probably because a customer backed out and couldnt afford it after ordering. In your price range are some Simpsons Kent if on sale etc Simpsons best is similar to TGN finest in terms of being decently soft but having good backbone. Kents are supposedly pillow soft but a bit floppier which would make them excellent if youre a heavy creambowl user Ive never used one thoughDIYA dremel or something similar will make this much easier. Otherwise I imagine it would go from being annoying to quite a pain to get the old knot out some are really stuck in there. TGN Finest knots are a great deal. They also have silvertip and high mountain which is supposedly a premium silvertip for a bit more. But I love the finest because its a great combo of backbone and softness for cheap. They have a new super finest but Im not sure what the extra money buys you.  Shavemac silvertip. This will be right at the edge of your budget but the knots and quality control are fantastic. You can email the owner to make sure you get what you want. The d is outside your price range I imagine but their regular is still quite good. Their finest is also excellent if you dont mind a bit of scritch but still mostly silvertip with awesome backbone its like a TGN on steroids Virginiasheng also sells knots. I can only speak to the synthetic but supposedly the silvertips are decent. Very cheap so you can experiment with them.Used Just watch bampb shavenook this forum for a good used deal. Honestly most used brushes youll find for sale will be great since people here usually buy nice stuff.,Shave_Bazaar,ckakuye,6,t5_2srzg

A well honed quality straight razor will shave just as well as the next one. A lot comes down to personal preference.

First run of a scent is always small though this time I have already reordered the scent oils I need to make much more since I am very  perhaps overly  confident about this scent.  Next to Sherlock it is  to me  the best scent Ive made.  Beyond that it is every stores choice what they will or wont carry.  Maggards is already carrying a lot of my product and I am not sure how many more they will wish to carry at this point.  I just got into their store so it would be prudent of them to establish that my product sells well before expanding my line.  They only have so much shelf space.,Shave_Bazaar,cqccwxs,2,t5_2srzg

4540412,0,t1_ct2npbv,No problem welcome!It essentially comes down to cosmetics. Personally I dont mind razors with a few scars. I think it makes them interesting historically but others prefer pristine conditions when looking for a razor. I guarantee all of these razors will be fine shavers but for example the  super speed is missing the plating on one of the door hinges although the plating on the head and handle is great. This doesnt affect the function but it isnt quite as pretty as the  super speed which is pretty much in mint condition and comes with the original factory case and blades blades are more of a collectors item. The  super speed is in better condition than the  one but not quite perfect like the  that comes with all the accessories. I hope this helps!,Shave_Bazaar,ct2y4og,1,t5_2srzg

5366205,0,t1_cvxl4q6,I believe the last time I ordered from Stirling they had an option to add menthol to anything. I know they did for aftershaves hopefulky they do for soaps too. They definitely have some scents up your alley Coniferous is exactly what it sounds like Pine trees balsam and firs. Its a great scent. Then there is Ozark Mountain. Lovely scent. Moss wood trees etc. Ive never been to the Ozarks but if it smells like the soap it will be amazing! I dont know what level of menthol they add. For instance I own Iced Coffee from Stirling. I love the soap great perky morning soap. But the menthol compared to their glacial line is much lower. Glacial is intense. This is a mild burn. The customer service at Stirling is phenomenal though! Email them and ask if they can add an amount similar to glacial to a piney scent. ,Shave_Bazaar,cvxldkp,1,t5_2srzg

6370766,0,t1_czdrsn8,Yeah the downvoters are stupid. This is one policy that I think the mods are on the wrong side. There used to ban on asking for FampF and without any public input and seemingly without any real thought they changed the rules. Since PayPal is the de facto standard the stated policy should not flout Paypals rules. That change also puts sb in the minority of trading forums almost every other forum has an explicit policy that GampS must be used. By being in the minority they are making sb a target for scammers. reddit in general has a strong sense of anonymity and many buyers are not as experienced so the rules need to be made clear. Many buyers dont even understand the difference so if theres no rule against it they wont see the warning signs of a possible scammer. ,Shave_Bazaar,czdsaxl,2,t5_2srzg

7246286,0,t1_d21ubrj,Ordinarily I dont post such things but since hes been so kind as to quote me at every opportunity here we aregtMate as simply as possible Im not here to argue with you ore to give you legal afvice. Im here to use soaps and share my tipsexperiences. If youve sought legal advice on how to label your soaps for international sale then go with it  my general tip was along the lines of you use the same label everywhere... Im not THE expert but you might want to check whether this is okay in all jurisdictions. Again... not here to advise you or suggest you have broken any laws. Friendly advice you might call it...Theres a small hipster follow for your soaps on reddit and you have a right to be proud of that. However as I mentioned I honestly prefer a number of other soaps. Customer service is what sets you apart and I think youll find I made some very positive comments about it.gtPrivately  my review received more than  comments so was popular by the standards of the subreddit. More than  users have messaged me saying they agree with my review and they are sick of hipsters latching onto fads. Im not going to go publicising this but youve just laid into somebody who has purchased a few hundred bucks worth of your gear plus postage and an unfavourable exchange rate and reviewed it on its merits. In my mind this is enough to throw out the good will that you provided. Goodbye  I will not be purchasing any more of your products and I am now refusing to trade them or give them away. Theyve gone into the bin... in future I will do business with people who choose not to get involved in trying to assassinate their customers on reddit.gtBest wishes  Im sure youre better off without me.In light of such charming correspondence which followed the thread I linked and all of the lovely accusations and assumptions being thrown about it seemed that this particular customer was simply not worth the headache anymore. For what its worth Im happy to discuss my formulas procedures and business practices if you should happen to have any questions. ,Shave_Bazaar,d21unft,6,t5_2srzg

The Old Types are common razors that can be picked up for a few bucks. Most of the brushes are vintage so they arent usable in their current state and would need to be restored. Vintage blades are just for collecting if youre into that kinda thing. The Gillette Techmatic was probably the worst razor Gillette ever made. ,Shave_Bazaar,dah2j8u,2,t5_2srzg

We have well water that is really hard and thus utilize a water softener. We have zero build up of soap scum mineral deposits etc. Seriously we have to clean the shower walls maybe twice a year.
