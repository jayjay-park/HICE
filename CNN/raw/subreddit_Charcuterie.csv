6477341,0,t1_czp9py6,gt  If no water is drawn how would one think regarding even distribution of the nitrites in the meat?Well think about it this way  the meat doesnt know if the salt comes from water solution or from crystals. Sure there will be some water drawn to make very concentrated and very thin layer of salt solution from the crystal salt. Then the salt will start soaking into the meat and distributing inside it evenly. Evenly because of thermodynamics. The more salt will go in the less youll have outside. When you dry cure it is important how much salt do you put on it. When you do wet cure the concentration of salt in the solution matters as it mostly doesnt change during the cure. It takes  days to spread the salt through the meat. It is defined by diffusion coefficient for salt in meat. If you would put your meat into a box of salt you will never run out of salt outside so it will continue going in and will make the meat too salty. If you have a brining solution outside the salt will stop going in as soon as the concentration inside will become equal to the outside concentration. Then it will stop. Thats why you shouldnt use more dry salt than Ruhlman recommends. It all will get sucked in. Go ahead and smoke it!,Charcuterie,czpayi8,3,t5_2t1u1

I let them go for about  weeks based on the speed of cure moving through meat at an inch per week. When it was cured I ran it through a fully cooked ham schedule in the smokehouse My boss was nice enough to let me use the work smoker on a down day and got got it back in the cooler.Taste was good but not all that different than what I was used to.

9027110,0,t1_d7wqt4i,Thank you for your response!Heres a pic. So normally when I buy commercial salami the casing is tight to the meat and thus very textured and has ridges etc. This if you look closely is still sort of like when it started even though the meat in the middle has shrunk. Not sure why or how but it just seems strange. I do have enough of them  varying in length from  to  that cutting into one of them would be a good call just to see what happens. I did use rehydrated Bactoferm LHP dry in the mix fresh from sausagemaker.com and according to instructions. I also followed Salumis instructions and put it in an  degree cooler for  hours to get the culture started before I put it in the curing chamber. So maybe Im just making too big a deal of this? I guess the big questions are. Do I put it back into the chamber at  humidity and . Should I respray with Mold ?The reason I took it out of that humid chamber was that according to what Ive read it should lose  in three weeks but at roughly four weeks it was only at  loss.

11571366,0,t1_dg7l6br,Thanks. There is a lot of misinformation out there.As I looked further into this veggies like spinach and celery are high in nitrAtes and low in nitrItes as the source I first examined asserted.My question was not pointed but out of curiosity.,Charcuterie,dg7mcab,1,t5_2t1u1
11701072,0,t1_dgm9alk,I suppose you could try but itd be hard to know just how much salt has been absorbed since it was never measured in the first place. The risk would be pulling too much salt back out again then it spoils when you air dry it. Youd most likely just not pull enough salt out and still end up with an over salty piece.,Charcuterie,dgmc2uw,2,t5_2t1u1
