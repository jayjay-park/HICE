2650945,0,t1_cn4jorw,launching calc.exe is an usual way to show that you can execute arbitrary code on a windows target when writing a proof of concept exploit for a vulnerability you found. Sometimes you are restricted to a certain size by a buffer and often a smaller size can help you,tinycode,cn4ly9n,3,t5_2slqf

3310973,0,t3_2y1ssu,Wicked cool but as a user on the site commented there are some real limitations to it that prevent it from technically being a full chess game.  It does not allow you to promote pawns youre not able to capture pawns en passant which is the diagonally forward capture method and youre not able to castle with your rook and king.  Nevertheless that is a tiny flippin implementation of chess especially with an AI in there.,tinycode,cp5ofqc,6,t5_2slqf

7570296,0,t1_d32l3c1,Hey! Thanks for inviting to make this AMA!Limitations are source for inspiration for sure! I was always admiring the stuff people can create within strict boundaries of limitations ascii art pixel art procedural graphics and music and of course intros. Farbrausch Threestate Haujobb Exceed and many others were my heroes when I was a teen.  Sometimes initial theme is dictated or suggested by the compo thats the good case. In the other cases Im quite rarely struck by inspiration. You can see me mentioned in a lot of prods but theres not so many my own ones. The good thing there is xemuserxem who almost every week generates a new awesome idea and skypes me Hey dude wanna golf?  Personally I start a new project almost nongolfed at least until my first prototype stand up and run. Sometimes it can stay readable up to the end like the last year jsk invitro its minification was entirely automatic. Of course it was not just just uglify all the things I had to write an ugly preprocessor using ugly regexps that makes some magic About that ugly preprocessor. I didnt like it so much Ive made a general purpose constant inliner Rhubarb Optimizing code for RegPack gave me the idea to sort SVG attributes so its better compresed by GZIP and.. theres more. Although Im trying to separate production projects and golf projects code golf has influence on my prod code for sure.,tinycode,d32pf34,3,t5_2slqf
7631799,0,t1_d39lc5b,It already does this! Every keyup the  link in the top right corner of the current note updates with a shareable URL of the currently loaded note. Sending that link to a friend  another device will open MemoPad and add that note to localStorage. Clicking a share link in the browser where its already saved will import a new copy of that note from the URL hash and this allows you to duplicate notes pretty easily as well.,tinycode,d39p01a,1,t5_2slqf

11255369,0,t1_df7prb5,You are spot on. Im glad you like it. Its not at all clear though whether this indirect approach is truly shorter than writing the game directly in C. But I like the fact that by just replacing the string literal you could get snake or sokoban or whatever you like.,tinycode,df7s24n,2,t5_2slqf
