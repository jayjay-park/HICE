EV EBITDA and EBIT are not really relevant for brokers because interest income and expense on securities inventory is below the line like commercialretail banks.

196238,0,t3_1wbls3,As a shareholder and part owner of the business you should think of the cash as yours  youre simply allowing the company to allocate it on your behalf. What do you want to do with it? If there are high ROI investment opportunities  available to the company i.e. unavailable to you as an individual investor that earn more than the companys cost of capital you want the company to put it back into work. If you dont think there are or you dont trust management to execute on them youll want the money back. This is why you see high profile activist investors frequently agitating the Board to return cash to shareholders and why dividend and buybacks are generally looked upon as shareholderfriendly moves.A lot of the time management of mature companies will hoard cash and look for ways to spend it acquisitions new products developing things etc. as a way of justifying their paycheck and job title. Sometimes these are good investments many times theyre not.apple posted a great link that pretty much covers it. A share repurchase is essentially the company investing its cash in itself. Its essentially the company saying it will earn an ROI higher than its cost of capital by investing in the company as if it were making any other kind of investment. If you feel the shares are undervalued then youd prefer a buyback. If not youd prefer a dividend.,SecurityAnalysis,cf0sk6a,2,t5_2s7v0

2860327,0,t3_2sv1z2,Insurance companies are very complex so I would suggest diving into some of the concepts you are noting on the balance sheet to help you understand the true nature of the operations.  While listing out current vs. noncurrent assets and liabilities is a starting point understanding the underlying asset or liability will both help you understand the company and whether or not it is current or noncurrent.upaulatreidess gave a good GAAP definition of the different classifications and rightly pointed out that a lot of times it will depend.  For example Other Assets and Liabilities  these often tend to be catchall lines.  If an account is small enough I think lt it can all be lopped into the Other line item.  This keeps the BS from becoming unusably detailed. Other Investments and Mortgage Loans  Again you need more information about the types of investments in these accounts to know if they are current or noncurrent.Then there are some insurance specific concepts that materially affect the business.  For example Separate accounts and contractholder funds  These should be offsetting accounts because its not really the companys money.  These are deposits the asset held by Allstate on variable life products that are due back to the policyholder the liability. Deferred policy acquisition costs DAC This the bane of many accountants as it is a balance derived by actuaries to amortize the costs of underwriting policies over the life of the contract.  Depending on the type of contract and Allstate does it all this can differ greatly Reinsurance Recoverable  Allstate pays other people to take parts of certain lines of business off their books.  This is the amount they are owed.  Most likely it is a result of claims paid by Allstate that are due back to them.  I would look into what businesses are being reinsured so you know which revenue streams and lines of business you are actually buying.On the flip side Im not sure if Allstate reinsures business.  So they may be taking on other business that you havent really looked into. Reserves Again what kind of reserves are these for?  This is the money set aside in the expectation of having to pay out based on different policies.  There is generally a current and a noncurrent portion of the reserve.  But by and large I would say these are not current liabilities.This was a bit of stream of consciousness based on my understanding of insurance companies.  There is a lot more up there so feel free to PM with any other questions.,SecurityAnalysis,cnt7y45,2,t5_2s7v0

Yes I think its very helpful to be able to build DCFs and do full analysis write ups. While various firms will have different approaches to find and evaluate companies understanding the theory behind calculating the value of a company is fundamental to your work. Even if its never used every other strategy that is used is pretty much related to the concept of the DCF because it theoretically calculates the intrinsic value of a firm. The main reason why its not always built is because it is time consuming and there are several shortcut strategies that can get to a close enough answer.Examples of decent work are equity research analyst reports. Masterful would be some of the things the top hedge funds produce but its harder to get ahold of examples there though some hedge funds will publish presentations typically due to a conference so their idea gets traction.If youre an intern I dont think you can do anything now to be .

But when it comes to measuring the way innovation contributes to GDP there is nothing close to consensus.How do you measure the value of Google maps? Or voice recognition software?If I buy a solar energy system for my home that purchase adds its cost to GDP. But if I then take myself off the power grid I am no longer sending the electric company  a month. And that reduces GDP by that amount. Yet Im using the same amount of electricity! My lifestyle hasnt changed but my disposable income has risen.Black markets? The sharing economy? The new gig jobs which are off the radar? So much of our economy doesnt easily fit into neat financial models. GDP is a political construction.Source ,SecurityAnalysis,d7fna7n,2,t5_2s7v0
8933834,0,t1_d7ldyx9,No thats not right.  Read the  annual report and the  Q quarterly.  They provide a linebyline explanation of the balance sheet.  I think the assets cash earnout JV stake etc are worth substantially more than current market cap.  They also have an operating business that gets management fees related to the OchZiff JV.  They werent generating any profit from it because its subscale and managements compensation was excessive for the size of the business.  Management has now been kicked out after it lost a proxy contest against the board.  During the proxy fight the board gave an estimate of cost savings it believed it could achieve once excessive management comp was cut.  The savings are very material in light of the companys current market cap.  In addition it appears that management essentially went on strike for the last year refusing to do any additional deals in the JV or otherwise unless the board increased their compensation.  Now that management is out theres an opportunity to gain additional scale by growing the size of the portfolio either inside or outside the OchZiff JV.  This business should have substantially operating leverage.  So growth assuming reasonable purchase prices would create significant value.   One of the reasons I recommended this investment to the OP is that the company is small enough that the disclosures allow you to understand each line item in the financials.  Thats not really possible with the megacaps that most people focus on.,SecurityAnalysis,d7lpqro,2,t5_2s7v0

9080095,0,t3_54munj,I think hes totally right. But for a few other reasons.The punch card investment is more a theoretical exercise than a practical application. Neither Buffett nor Munger practiced this. Buffetts talked about the benefits of small amounts of diversification. Now there are other aspects people ignore about Buffett such as his focus on netnets. He has said he would be investing in netnets if his capital base were smaller. How many investors actually do? Buffett matured to a quality investor out of necessity. The netnets were too small for him once Berkshire grew. I think people read Buffett and pick and choose what they like and want to apply. Looking at crap businesses isnt as fun for most people. Also another side note Buffett repeatedly talks about how important the Dale Carnegie course was to him  I cant take a Buffett fanatic seriously if they havent taken it. ,SecurityAnalysis,d83a393,3,t5_2s7v0

Ive seen it as both EBITInvested Capital and Net IncomeInvested Capital.If you use the former formula then youre right the ROIC does not change with debt repayments. But if you use the latter then it would because you have less interest being taken out of net income boosting the numerator. Does that make sense?

Decrease Accounts Receivable Balance Sheet Make an entry in the Income Statement for Bad DebtIncome decreases by M if Income before this was gtM then yes the effect to Net income would be M assuming  tax rate.

11706189,0,t3_670hi0,Moats can usually be associated with two business details i pricing power or ii a strong brand.The existence of pricing power means your business isnt commoditized or your product serves a differentiated value proposition vs competitors which allows you to raise prices. The ability to raise prices is by far the highest competency a business can have to increase profits since it doesnt require any incremental costs. e.g. McDonalds raises its prices every year and nobody even blinks. This results in an increasing ROEROC over time.Most companies with moats can also be associated with a strong brand. The reason why strong brands are usually associated with moats is because they are intangible assets which gives you an avenue to increase revenues without incurring incremental costs. This may not necessarily be related to pricing power for instance CocaCola cuts their prices every year but the brand allows them to retain unit profits by increasing volume and economies of scale at a faster rate than they cut prices. This too results in increasing ROEROC over time. Companies with one or the other usually both tend to exhibit rising ROEsROCs over time due to their ability to increase revenues at a faster rate than expenses. The reasons for this may morph over time but the characteristic is common across all companies with moats. This is not to say however that a sustained increase in ROEROCs equals having a moat there are plenty of companies in commoditized businesses which also show increasing ROEROCs. ,SecurityAnalysis,dgmx7xm,2,t5_2s7v0
