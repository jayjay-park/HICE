I also downloaded the Pocket MAL app for Android  its very good!Beautiful Bones ep.  it may have been because I was watching it lying on my side at am but it didnt seem to make sense??

6512625,0,t1_czsvczr,gtI heard about it and Im quite interested in the DS game. I read about it and you always get the recommendation to first play  and I just cant get used to the small ds screen anymore.You can play DS games on the DS though. You cant go back to the home screen without quitting the game or use streetpass with the game open but the game itself should run just fine.  And yep while VLR can technically be played as a standalone itll make a lot more sense if youd played the first game first. Also when you get to VLR remember to look up the save bug so you dont accidentally lose your progress.gtIm not really interested in Ace Attorney.. maybe prof. layton but dunno... never heard about Hotel DuskLast Window though. Maybe Ill look into that Hotel Dusk is a bit more interactive than a typical VN if I understand the genre correctly but it was one of the highly recommended DS games for a reason.  Professor Laytons probably the least VNish on that list but I can see how it kinda counts. Definitely worth looking into if you like solving puzzles. Ive also seen Ghost Trick and Trace Memory come up a lot in reference to VNs for being strongly storyoriented.,xxanime,czsyfjd,2,t5_399jj

If youre a fan of reverse harem anime theres not a huge amount of options so I guess over time you become less picky or start learning Japanese for all the visual novels they have!The songs were my favourite part it was refreshing to have an anime that actually has musical elements.

7826213,0,t1_d3ssc2k,I am on the boat that I dont like most harem anime but reverse harem Im usually okay with lol.. Probably because reverse harem in my experiences have had a lot less tits and ass.,xxanime,d3vqe3k,4,t5_399jj
8256169,0,t3_4s7qgz,I personally didnt like it so much as I expected going into it with a lot of hype from the online anime community and I think going in with a lot of hype really killed my enjoyment overall.I personally think its because I saw people comparing SteinsGates Okabe to Subaru and that threw me off because it seemed to me that Okabe was a lot more competent and a lot less creepy to the girls around him. He seemed like a real person and I liked that whilst some scenes with Subaru can seem a bit weird or forced talking about cup sizes with the girls and they dont care or straight up flirting with them when he has no more feelings towards them than friendly. Its just a bit off putting especially from people who claim it isnt harem and Im aware he has chosen a girl but it just doesnt feel real. Another reason could be that the first arc was short and fast and really captivating. I really liked that and that there was an end goal to be seen and gave you some insight into what to do. But the second arc is all over the place it loses the cool setting the first one had a bit drags on for way too long  episodes I have compared it to endless  in enjoyment and doesnt focus on the relationship that I wanted to see transform Emilia and Subaru.And finally I just after  episodes didnt particularly care too much for any of the characters. I understood and could empathize with them about their problems but overall they seemed way too tropish and I couldnt get myself to care about what happened to them or the relationships. I cared more about the characters in Kabaneri and I suspect thats a bit of a slap to most fans of this show lol.Overall I think I gave it a  from where I stopped watching episode  because it did have its hype moments but it was just an endless focus on cute girls and saving his waifu not that she was capable of fighting and protecting herself? and found myself let down because I wanted to be in on the hype but just couldnt get into it. Dont go into it with any expectations and you might enjoy it otherwise you may want to pass on this.,xxanime,d59kt8j,3,t5_399jj

8671344,0,t1_d6p9uxc,If you have any interest at all I suggest you watch it. It is one of those series where my opinion of season two is considerably better than season one which I was not a fan of.I had a lot of complaints regarding season one similar to you. Haru was a big part of it as well as the drama and character interactions. Second season gave Haru more depth introduced new characters and more realistic problems. I could go in detail with the comparison but since you seem interested in s Im just going to encourage you to watch it without giving away much.

Its sort of a prequel to Ghost in the Shell except as interpreted by the writer of Excel Saga. Speaking of Excel Saga is debatably ecchi but hilarious and a great parody of the late searly s girlexploitation shows that were so popularthink Slayers Read or Die Gunslinger Girl.Overall though ecchi is one of those genres that is way more palatable in printed form than animated.,xxanime,d7520nm,2,t5_399jj

In any case him saying no theyre not married makes sense becausewell they really arent. It doesnt look like they even talk openly about their love even though they both know what they are doing so all their reaction makes sense to me. Dont know if I could explain myself though haha Also I agree about Viktor. Im so surprised and happy that he seems to be the pining kind of person.

11500790,0,t1_dfz1xgx,God I forgot how good this show was about building the Rakugo performances not just into the plot but into the themes of the show. I actually dropped Rakugo originally from lack of interest around ep  but even then I was stunned when we got a scene like the Yotaro rakugo scene in the first episode. Truly glorious in how it worked out. The second episode continued it more elaborating on the two main starsthe excitable reckless masculine Sukeroku vs the restrained calculating anxious feminine Kikuhiko. Another thing I didnt notice on first read was how feminine Kikuhiko is in general Ive heard rumors about things that happened in the manga and later on and how that plays into his character so Im really interested to see what happens from here.Overall an exceptional two episodes.
