697285,0,t1_cgj4o5t,I took Calc III in the fall. It wasnt too difficult but I struggled because I didnt spend enough time actually learning. Put the time and effort in and I think you should be fine.thats true for all classes at Hopkins though,jhu,cgjj7yc,1,t5_2shup

3679427,0,t3_32iq07,I just started full time from another university last Fall.  Throwaway cause I dont want work associated with my main account.The lab is actually pretty far from the JHU campus.  Its doable but its just a long drive every day.  Theres a ton of interns in the summer and I know theres a lot going on plus softball running clubs etc.  But thats mainly during the summer Im not so sure about the Fall.  With your interests you should really take advantage of Central Spark at APL.  I think theres a hobby electronics club a d printer available for use and other interesting things to mess with.Im not sure what types of sightseeing youre into but theres a lot of good places to go.  The museums in DC lots of hiking around the DMV Gettysburg within driving distance...  I cant really speak so much about meetups as Im new around here myself and I live south of campus instead of north near Baltimore.,jhu,cqbog8u,3,t5_2shup
3717979,0,t3_32z02k,Engineering students are assigned an advisor over the summer who will help you choose classes for the fall.  Depending on your AP credits most engineering majors take the same core of calc physics and chemistry and associated labs anyway.  Really the only class that differs between engineering departments the first year is an elective.  To switch into BME you can apply to the department at the end of your first semester.  I would contact someone from BME now and tell them your situation and see what they say. Couldnt hurt and itll get you at least a little bit in the door with them. Everyone I know who has successfully switched into BME had really good grades their first semester.  Its hard to switch into it from what Ive heard.To switch into any other engineering major or any major in art and sciences too you just need to fill out a form and get the appropriate signatures.  ,jhu,cqg2qwd,1,t5_2shup

3822664,0,t1_cqm6m7x,Not exactly. Ive received internship offers there for postJunior and Senior year going into my Masters and from multiple groups within the APL each time. Ive got . which isnt the highest GPA around. They also have the SPUR program which is quite small but only for Hopkins students and the Advanced Application Scholars program which is also only for Hopkins students. Obviously theyre still relatively selective but being at Hopkins does give you a leg up.,jhu,cqs0kz4,1,t5_2shup

Databases is basically the actual sql statements and how to retrieve data for the most part. Im not sure exactly what  is but I believe is how systems like sql actually work. ,jhu,dbs44xa,1,t5_2shup
11441887,0,t3_63adav,To be completely honest its what you make it. If your friend ended up in McCoy with good friends and good roommates theyll be fine. If not get ready for a year of hell.
