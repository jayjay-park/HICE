For example if someone had a tank they owned it still but couldnt call it up. Sort of like they did when they disabled the buy from phone before you should have bug where thats what happened it was purchased but unable to be used.If not then yeah its pretty much pointless.What Im hating is the new mental state thing. As it groups you with people of like mental state I get stuck with the griefers now since it seems like just simply fighting back raises your level quite a bit and once youre in a session with all red dots you dont get out for quite a while.
