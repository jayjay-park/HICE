500753,0,t3_1zm5x0,Im an ISTJ Im not sure of my girlfriends exact MyersBriggs but its definitely in the ENFP area and I love it.  I have to preface this by saying that were both very moderate in our personalities Im not extremely introverted shes not extremely extroverted but she brings a warmth and an emotional intelligence that are really encouraging and helpful to me.We can handle each other because our strengths work to support each others weaknesses.  I really enjoy being a stable anchor in her life and she enjoys bringing out my sillier side.  We enjoy just hanging out going on walks holding hands etc.  Its a serious relationship but also a pretty simple one.As for not being annoyed at her I feel just the opposite.  Being around her is challenging and exciting and I feel like I become much more wellrounded and healthy as a result.  There are of course times when Im tired and dont feel like I can quite handle it but as long as we communicate about stuff like that shes been very understanding and accommodating.,ISTJ,cfx6tk9,5,t5_2r4yh

Then I found my brothers music which was much more along the lines of techno. Once I gained access to the internet around  I discovered trance. There are still some tunes from that period I still listen to frequently this being my favorite. Ive since slid away from trance and techno and moved over to many other genres.Since its so easy to discover new music and I get a kick from finding something new that is similar to something I already like my music taste has expanded exponentially the past  years.

9445950,0,t3_564cux,the pain of ending a relationship is always real no matter what your MBTI is.that being said I think you wanted to know specifically how an ISTJ would handle the situation. the other comments appear to be very thorough anecdotes about individual breakups in mind so I will offer mine as a generalityEmotions are difficult. Most of the time I dont have feelings about things. They are just things. As a Sensing type I dont put a lot of faith in Intuition. Even when I could be going through something that should have a very obvious emotional connotation You just won the lottery so you should be ecstatic! or Someone just broke into your car so you should be angry! I would still have difficulty admitting that there are even emotions there. I measure the situations based on how they would benefit or detriment my future. I prefer to view these nebulous feelings through the lens of logic which does not make sense in itself but thats how I try to make it make sense. And thus theres a lot of confusion. Toward the end of a relationship regardless of who ends it I find myself fretting a lot. I suppose the predominant emotion would be worry or downright unhappiness trying to come to terms with why it didnt work out.I prefer to discuss what went wrong to see if I could learn from it or if I could change something. I remember after a breakup once he called to ask if we could talk in person and I agreed. I said Meet at Panera at noon tomorrow and I brought a box of tissues and a list of questions I wanted to ask. It was still hard but I felt like I had said what I wanted to say and did my best in understanding what happened. Putting things down on paper helps me  I want to have something concrete to help me organize my thoughts. I advise the newly brokenup to write letters to their exes without sending them just to get all the things they wanted to say out of their mind so then they become less of a mental and emotional burden.ISTJs are probably the least whimsical and romantic of the types. I acknowledge that life goes on. That relationship was just not meant to be and its okay to miss that person and what you had with them but it shouldnt defeat you as a person. Ive gone through countless relationships and as a result been hurt by many people and many situations but Im still figuring out who I am and Im content to know I still have the opportunity to find love.,ISTJ,d9dca9e,2,t5_2r4yh

Ive met many people that arent churchgoers who carry out the example of Jesus better than those that dont miss a service every Sunday.I get the feeling like the Church tries to say that everyone who is an Atheist gay lesbian or trans is wrong and is going to hell and that kind of thing just disturbs me.I also feel like a lot of your average churchgoers have this im holier than thou persona about them that makes them nice and friendly while they are at Church but the second they step out into the world outside of those doors they start putting everyone else in the world down because they automatically think they are going to Heaven and that they are better than everyone else.
