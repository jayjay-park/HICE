Thats just talking point nonsense.  The state has among the highest debt levels of any state in the country.  It has to balance its budget.  Its a constitutional requirement.  And it doesnt have to be done on the backs of the poor.  No one is suggesting that.

The rest is all political BS.Funny how the State of Indiana can cut labor costs and reduce payrolls then run a budget surplus but IL is some mystical abyss where laws of economics dont matter and a first term Governor who is in office for . yrs is responsible for  years of fiscal irresponsibility when he turns off the endless spending spigot and upsets everyone.,illinois,d4euss6,2,t5_2qhco

10410784,0,t3_5p0usr,You can look at the court cases but the TLDR is they dont have to fund it but they do HAVE to pay it when due. In other words once you have retired the state has a very solid obligation to pay you. One that puts your pension behind only bond payments but ahead of ALL OTHER debts. So when the Stuart Littles of the world say it wont be there keep in mind that the state has never missed a pension payment owed to an annuitant and that for things to be bad enough to not be there youre going to have a lot worse problems to worry about like a total collapse of the us government and economy.  That said what works for you depends on your future plans. Will you be there long enough to even vest?  years check for your system.  The pension has great value only after many years of service check your multiplier and look at what it would take. Say you retire at  making k.  years from now plus inflation! intentionally outrageously high!! Would you be able to scrape by on k x .. x  years? Comparably if you are only there  years the formula might be something like k x . . x  years.  So if this is your CAREER go pension.

10807748,0,t1_ddupwpv,I have done my research but you didnt do any.  I want to clear here just so there is no confusion.  The extent of your research of fascism is reading one article thats been forwarded around to all the leftist messageboards simply because it panders to their ignorance.When you actually do research you start wondering how the hell anyone actually thinks Trump is a fascist.  They confuse Nationalist with fascism.  Im going to point out that you didnt even bother to address my two points about fascism in my previous post.  I guess when someone actually points it out to you you dont like it.  I still think its absolutely hilarious that you took that username.  Its a perfect description of exactly whats wrong with you kids.gt Im not the one that lives with all white people and what I presume is probably a suburban or rural area.Oh swing and a miss on that one.  Live and work in downtown chicago.  Not sure I could get any more opposite of your presumption.gtIm also not the one holding up a candidate that couldnt even win the majority of the popular vote.Still grasping at that one?  Seriously get over it.  It hasnt mattered ever and it still doesnt matter.  You need to stop pretending that this is an argument.gtYour boy one by technicality because we are a republic that emphasizes minority rights.Yeah technically winning the election the way that its designed to be won.  And where are you coming up with Trump winning on minority rights?  That was Hillarys campaign focus but she was terrible at it.Im actually amazed right now.  I havent heard anyone using the he didnt win the popular vote excuse in almost two months now.  Everyone else figured out that its not an actual argument.  Kuddos to you for really trying to keep it alive against all the logical and intelligent people who realized the ignorance in arguing it.  You know what I would like to see.  Id like to see you living in an ACTUALLY fascist government just so that you can actually recognize what it truly is.  If you did that youd never confuse Trump with actual fascism ever again.,illinois,dduqrmc,1,t5_2qhco

11199464,0,t3_5zu9go,Yeah this site is a joke. California is somehow the th best state to be a taxpayer apparently. Nevermind the fact that they have the highest income taxes in the country and the highest property taxes for new homeowners in the countryassuming median home price in the state.If youve lived in the same house for  years and are low income in california then yea its a great state to live since you have locked in property tax rates and dont make much.But if youre a new grad moving to California to chase the job market the taxes are awful. If you manage to buy a house you pay an insane amount of property taxes on it. If you rent you have to pay an insane amount to rent because of land owners passing property taxes onto renters and their rent controlsinsane taxes on new property discouraging construction of new apartments.,illinois,df1g1vs,10,t5_2qhco

11794322,0,t3_685cjb,Ive lived in Mt. Vernon for almost ten years.  Everyone else is right its not as growing as fast as Marion or Effingham really. Has Continental Tire which is always hiring for factory work. A brand new hospital was just built a few years ago. A new high school this school year. The big advantage compared to Marion or Effingham is proximity to St. Louis. Its about  minutes less of a drive from Mt. Vernon to STL. That came come in handy. The metro east is less than an hour away. Housing is cheap. Schools are okay. Relatively safe. Could be better. Could be worse. ,illinois,dgwxctt,2,t5_2qhco
