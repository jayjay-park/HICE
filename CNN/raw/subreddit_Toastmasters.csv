7444669,0,t1_d2ndacx,I apologize. Having worked in IT for a decade it seems like every service we have that moves out of the United States turns to shit. My thought here was pragmatism.There are many places in other countries where this wouldnt be a negative move but it could go wrong in many places. Staying in the US is in my opinion a safety feature against a potential flight of fancy if the director and board lines up in certain ways. Seeing how they seem to unilateraly make decisions such as the recent inexplicable dues increase I dont thing this is a bad idea.Maybe language with more specifics on future locations not simply saying the US would address these concernsfears.,Toastmasters,d2oetnj,1,t5_2s72y

11584570,0,t3_5ws379,I suggested to one club I attend who was struggling with membership was to put a flyer in the restrooms of the facility they had their meetings.  They met at a church and each week s of people came to the church and having a sign could help bring in new people.The problem with social media is you need to keep advertising for it to work.  The sign in the bathroom may be seen  times by one individual over a year and when somebody says something about public speaking that person will remember the sign in the restroom and tell that person.  I would suggest you search for a local organization close to your meeting spot and see if you can network with their group and share on social media.  Build a marketing campaign for your social media and then tweak it as you go.,Toastmasters,dg949a8,1,t5_2s72y
