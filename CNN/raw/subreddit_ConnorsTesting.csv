11689343,0,t3_65fif9,Have you considered something like Amulet of Inebriation? Something to get rid of the drunk screen and improve the effects of alcohol like the Amulet of Ashamanu does for diseases. Because doing ideas like The Drunken Fist are near impossible due to the screen effect atm. They are possible but youd almost be better closing your eyes to keep from actually getting dizzy haha,ConnorsTesting,dgl06ta,1,t5_3jb53
