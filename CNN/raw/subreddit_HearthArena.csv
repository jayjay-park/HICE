2600347,0,t1_cmxzw98,Bloodfen Raptor also has drop score.Spider Tank and Ogre shifted the meta a bit there and we have not yet reevaluated the meta to see how good Bloodfen Raptor really is as a drop.  It used to be a fair dorp.  It could be that now it is in fact a pretty worthless drop.  However it is still as effective against all common neutral drops besides the top  as other nonpremium drops are.  Ultimately if were counting Ironfur Grizzly as a drop were counting Raptor as almost a drop.  In light of the new GvG meta  increase in premium drops which is actually less than  the offer rate we may change the values a bit.  But thats a gradual process.  This is not a bug just a valuation question which we are still undecided on.  It is correct for the preGvG meta and we will adjust these to the finer points of the GvG meta as it becomes more settled.,HearthArena,cmy03ub,1,t5_35cv7

The advice bubble might be the most important feature of the entire site because it actually gives you insight into why the algorithm makes the decisions that it does.

2689350,0,t1_cn9m238,Of course I agree completely re Sample Size. I dont want to say that because of this run I think HearthArena is better. My point is more that I was curious to see what the difference between two similar sites was. The greater emphasis on combos seems more important in GvG. Drafting on mostly singlecard value seems less good now. That the deck is outperforming my expectations is nice for me but mostly irrelevant. Although I wonder ...

2823240,0,t1_cn4gd9a,I think the difference here is between a twodrop and a play you can make on turn two. I interpret twodrops as minions you can play on turn two.

Eventually I got back to back  arenas and I hadnt gone  for more than  arenas prior to those runs. I ended up taking a few week break after that. Came back and felt like I was playing very clearly and better than ever. Followed up with my best hot streak in arena yet smth avg over  runs smth similar to when arena coop started.

3729307,0,t3_333wej,Had something similar last week with x  followed by a . Here is my profile I went with heartharena with most of the picks except in the mage draft where I decided to gamble on it turning into a  wins deck rather than go with the safest choices. It ended up working surprisingly well with most of the matchs me being able to get the mad scientist start into duplicating a cobra or a sunfury protector to slow down the game till I can drop one of my big minions amp duplicate them too. It also probably helped that people kept playing around my nonexistant flamestrike which slowed them even more once turn  arrived. That said each of them had a game or  that I would have lost if my opponent didnt misplay badly or I didnt get incredibly lucky especially in the hunter where I had a quick shot into kill command twice so I wouldnt really have been able to do it in a harder meta.In the end though my luck ran dry in the last run where I would have gone  win in the last match if my opponent shredder didnt drop a doomsayer on this board instantly losing me the game.,HearthArena,cqhd5y9,2,t5_35cv7

3880164,0,t1_cqyfdn3,sorry I wasnt clear on what I meant.  When I drafted hunter I would get lots of aggressive low mana cost cards but I found it difficult for me with my personalityplay style to act aggressively when playing the deck.  I would play as if I am a control hunter until I realized I needed to turn the heat up or else I might lose to a card disadvantage.lol yeah warrior is probably better than made out to be.  Warrior seems very comboy and with the right cards he can do well.  I have played against so few warriors but some of those were very aggressive and beat me.

3970068,0,t3_35xm0r,We too care much more about the underlying considerations than the picks themselves.  Thats why I think youre off base here about your concerns and that everything you cited is already being correctly big picturewise handled by our system.First I would love to see where we count arcane intellect as a  drop.  We dont even count most badantitempo minions as full drops.... let alone a spell that has no effect on the board.  Each card has  calculated values associated with it to determine exactly how it functions in your decks curve in addition to its mana cost of course.  Arcane Intellect has never counted or been displayed as a drop by HearthArena.   What you are saying here is flat out wrong and it shocks me that such a longtime user would think that given that no nonminion spells show up as drops in the overview tab.The other considerations you cite are real.  Truesilver is good.  th one is not as good. Flamestrike is good rd one is not as good.  We have mountains of stats which prove this and should be noted that this was know prior to HearthArena from back in Arena Masterys stat analysis by wowmetrics.  Our system for preventing you from taking early cards you dont want too many of is based  on statistical probability the system will offer you and HearthArena will want you to pick that card so these two ideas are the same system.  We gave different weights using several constants per card to ensure these cards are being properly valued.   Our weights are not perfect but to suggest we stop doing this for good cards is...  not a winning suggestion.  There are actually about a dozen cards without this property but they are the exception and not the rule.  Most great cards are statistically worse when you have too many.  Even amazing flexible cards like FireballSwipe or FireWater Elemental.  You may disagree but our position here is not controversial and the theoretical basis for duplicate card and type of card value decay has been backed up by real user stats from even before our time.,HearthArena,cr8tk9p,6,t5_35cv7

3979167,0,t3_361mhc,Screenshotted are my last  arenas across the last week or so. Ive played Arena onandoff since Open Beta averaging  winsrun during the preGvG era but mostly staying away until HearthArena was publicly released a couple of months ago. Since then Ive played  runsweek average as the questlog permitted. For the first  arenas I started at . winsrun and slowly floated upwards to . winsrun at the start of the month. However last weekend I had the coldest run lifetimetodate going  or worse in four consecutive runs after only doing it three times in the first forty or so runs. I knew I wasnt getting worse at Arena but my lack of concern passively brought down my game as I had no recollection as to howwhy my win began to nosedive. In short taking shorthand notes keeps me honest as to why I lose games and well as sifting the unwinnable losses e.g. Bane of Doom into MalGanis Mana Wyrm into Flamecannon into Arcane Missilesping from the bad decisions Haunted Creeper into a Zombie Chow  L in the  Paladin run. ,HearthArena,cr9uwlm,3,t5_35cv7

4566561,0,t3_3dk5vc,The truth is theres no blindingly obvious rule. Youre playing the odds and to play the odds well you would need good stats on typical cards in oppos deck. Furthermore its not just about how many  drops they have. It is not unusual that trading your  mana removal for their  mana minion is the right call even if you know they have bigger guys. You basically cant afford to fall behind on the board ever unless youre very very sure that you can take it back and live!.So you dont have to use your removal on a  on T if you can play a  and a  that can clear it together. Its not a good situation and its not what you want because the  drop will  for  you. But you can save a hex in that situation. But if its T and you can only play a   drop and hero power you may need to blow your hex. His  drop and  to your empty board is often a direct line to losing the game.Unless youre holding rockbiter and Fel Reaver next turn. Many many variables but a good rule of thumb is that hold wasting premium removal if you can make a strong board play. If not dont.Something you need to think about in your examples is if youd actually have been able to win the game the other way. Its easy to see how you lost the game being wiped out by the Ironbark but think about the minion resources you would have had to sac into the sunwalker and think about what cards he might have been able to beat you with that way. Sometimes you just see the way you lost but not the way you would have lost anyway.,HearthArena,ct6891w,3,t5_35cv7

5067878,0,t3_3keu9h,The thing that makes Ironbeak Owl kinda bad isnt so much that silence is bad in Arena. Spellbreaker gets a base tier score of  so it is pretty good. And it has a the same  mana cost of the silence as the Owl. It is worth that  mana because it will often remove more than  manas worth from your opponents side.The problem with Ironbeak Owl is that there is rarely a good time to play it. You dont want to play it early because there wont be anything on the board worth silencing. And you dont want to play it late because the body will just die to a hero power and just the silence effect is rarely be worth a card that is why Silence is rated just .I think it is quite common for constructed players misjudge Ironbeak Owl in Arena. Ironbeak Owl is generally the preferred silence minion in constructed. But that is because silences are mostly used by aggro decks to bypass taunts. You just want the cheapest possible taunt in that situation so you can combine it with other damage from your hand to quickly take down your opponent. In Arena you will usually not get high damage combos like that so you cannot use Ironbeak Owl in the same way there.,HearthArena,cuwvcsa,10,t5_35cv7

5170741,0,t1_cv8zl8k,Tempo decks are not really my forte but the way that I play it is just as an aggro deck that starts being aggresive at the turn that I choose the turn that I play my mana efficient cards usually at the midgame.This mana efficient cards are unsurprisingly your overload cards   your Fire Elementals and Rockbiter Weapon and Mr. Hungry Dragon if you have a cheapno cost way to deal with the  drop playing this cards usually will mean that you will affect the board in a big way in  or  turns and give you an opening for throwing a big minion or many small minions without a lot of risk.With overload this plays tend to be a commitment more than with any other class overloading makes your next turn weak is almost as if you were paying your tempo with tempo but the effect of this cards are insane enough that if you manage to keep curving out your plays your opponent will in essence need a just as huge play to just be even with you on the board. Now the big problem with overload if your opponent actually manages a play like that the very next turn just when you are overloaded you will not be even you will be behind.Lets say my opponent is a Paladin I had the coin so he naturally is going to be  mana above me he played a  at turn  and another  at turn  a weak turn and they are still there and I have my own Mad Bomber in the board  mana and in my hand there is a Forked Lightning and a Micro Machine... I play this  cards amazing! board cleared and  minions on my side. Now its his turn he consecrates the board inmediately hes even on the board now except that I am overloaded and I can only play a  drop into his  drop he is  mana above me when he should be just .My mistake was pretty obvious I played into a classic Paladin power turn but I made it even worst for myself by playing an overload card I overcommited way more than I should and I got punished for it way more than any other class would. My advice is every time you play an overload card think twice and think about every power play your opponent may have sometimes you have no choice and you have to play into it and level up your dodging skills but in a tempo deck you have the options.My other pointer is pretty obvious smooth your curve specially with your early overload cards during mulligan. Dont play Totem Golem or Stormforged Axe unless you have a  drop in your next turn dont play Fireguard Destroyer unless you have a followup turn pretty basic Shaman mana management.This stuff might be pretty obvious but I think is good to remember that Shaman is a high riskhigh reward class when it comes to tempo plays.,HearthArena,cv99jd6,2,t5_35cv7

5298916,0,t1_cvoq1u0,Both decks had tons of reach and early removal.

5385162,0,t3_3os78k,For druid it is the only hard removal in the sense that it can just outright remove a card from the board. One thing druid struggles with is board clearsremoval. So other than mulch you would have to double swipe or BGH a big target. Which in arena is a much lower chance of a player having.    That is really my only guess that druid lacks big removal and mulch is one of the only options for it.,HearthArena,cw00juq,3,t5_35cv7

5439793,0,t3_3pjuda,Doomsayer can be an okay board clear sometimes but obviously not when the opponent has  damage on the board ... unless you just want to force him to not go face for one turn. Its not good without a lot of freeze but it does have situations  like when your opponent has just cleared your board but only has one or two small minions left himself and you need to stall for a turn for one more mana or so you can play card draw alongside Doomsayer to topdeck a decent threat etc.As for Beneath the Grounds its basically a dead card until you have no other play because it does nothing when played. The tempo loss is huge.  The earliest I can imagine playing it is turn  where maybe if I have multiple  mana minions I might play it alongside a drop.After playing it the Nerubians might not show up in time to matter and in any case late in the game a  can easily be cleaned up by big minions. They might help tilt the balance or they might just get eaten by a big drop. Obviously theyre much stronger if youre ahead on or fighting hard for the board when they arrive because then your opponent cant easily deal with them.Altogether that adds up to VERY Slow Tempo Loss Winmore and RNG. All factors that most players try to avoid in their picks. On the plus side... its a lot of bodies for the mana if they show up before the game is over.,HearthArena,cw6zjaw,2,t5_35cv7
5545647,0,t3_3ok9ui,A temporary hack could be to go to the HearthArena website and fakeend your incomplete runs. For example add losses until you hit  but put unknown as the opponent class so you know it wasnt a real game. Then when you are ready to go back to that arena run delete the fake games and fake out any other runs that are interfering so that you can see the one you want in Overwolf.,HearthArena,cwkhljv,2,t5_35cv7
5552682,0,t3_3r2s6w,The main reason for this is most people use the coin early to get a  or drop out but that only catches you up to Player  for  turn. After the board evens out the person going first has the initiative to play a bigger threat each turn as theyre  mana ahead the rest of the game.So basically when you go first and draw a mana curve you win the game  of the time. The main counter to this is to save the coin for a high impact play a turn sooner that they cant deal with but that requires drawing an early game curve yourself or your opponent missing their curve or you lose to tempo.,HearthArena,cwlczz9,1,t5_35cv7

5986795,0,t1_cxnh6g1,I will be very surprised if he can find a world class arena consultant. Ive tried and they are very hard to find because of the very specific requirements needed. This is why AampM were so unique. Basing ratings on statistics seem fool proof at first thought but you quickly realize nothing can be the human brain at problem solving just yet. Statistics often lie. For instance HA recently wanted to move Pit Snake down below Clockwork Gnome because of statistics saying it was no good but this is because people were holding on to it instead of playing it for tempo. The value for this card will get adjusted as time goes by something statistics alone cant catch by itself. You are also very limited by the amount of statistics you can gather. The more you have the more accurate things are. Sometimes situations are too specific for statistics to help and when competing websites are developed this will split the amount of users for each site which renders statistics even more useless.,HearthArena,cy4eetg,1,t5_35cv7
