3147596,0,t3_2w6dci,Also not in the UK but I find shops which focus on a business casual look tend to be better for modesty. I also layer a lot  tank tops under super light blouses long sleeve tshirt under a low cut sweater that kind of thing. A lot depends on what your personal comfort zone is in terms of fittedness cut length etc.,CatholicWomen,coo8tzz,2,t5_2wlkr
3468967,0,t3_2qrvvb,Sorry for seeing this so late.  From what I have learned from some great Religious Sisters is that there are three main types of vocations religious life married life and single life.  Our vocations can change over time as God wills and thats ok!  Which is one of the reasons why some women chose to leave religious orders because they are needed for a different vocation.  Its ok not to get married.  Its ok not to want to be a mother.  Its ok that you have been called to be single and if that changes then so be it!  Its your life and your vocation.  Its between you and God.  In the end that all that matters. ,CatholicWomen,cpnor6o,1,t5_2wlkr
