5978596,0,t3_3xanur,he probably did.  I had the same experience after update.  Reboot PC load NMM turn all of them on close nmm.  Maybe even another reboot.  Reload NMM and launch game Minimize out and check plugins.  I got them to start working again.  Just took a few tries.,FO4mods,cy3bpdl,1,t5_389w4

7475071,0,t3_4hcgwh,Hello all.So Bethesda did do something which royally screws with mods something I only discovered yesterday after coming home from a long weekend away.  Here is what I learned and here is what fixed it for meFirst off and Im not sure why they decided this would be a good idea the Launcher appears to automatically deactivate all mods which you have installed.  I use NMM version .. for FO as I imagine many of you do too. Step   Open the Launcher for FO Step   Open NMM and verify that all the mods you want are activated Step   Disable any UI mods you have installed I used Full Dialog Interface and no dotdotdot... say goodbye to those... Step   Open FO from the launcher.You may need to through all your mods in NMM to manually deactivate them close NMM reopen NMM then reactivate the mods but that worked for me.I feel the pain of all people who have their mods fucked up by Bethesdas latest update.,FO4mods,d2rve9g,1,t5_389w4
7530078,0,t3_4icca4,Oh hell yes.  I had no idea how much I wanted this until now.  That would be incredible.  I love both the movie and the game and it would be so cool to make my shotguns sound like that.  ,FO4mods,d2y4szq,1,t5_389w4
7731197,0,t1_d3kynrn,Glad to help. I do enjoy some settlement mods. I happen to have a few other thoughts now.A lot of these will have overlap by type sitting chair but they rarely are the exact same thing. Its more a many chairs many textures kind of thing. I do like the options I cant think of what Id like without knowing what I can do but sometimes scrolling through menus can get a little tedious.Functional Displays just updated the description page of the mod saying that an update . should be coming soon. And I believe DDProductions is working on a new and improved allinone of his mods which if Im being overly honest basically gives me an erection. So keep an eye out for that. The mods I mean.Finally if you really want something from a mod but dont want all the clutter I believe this video by Elianora will explain how you can remove objects from your settlement menu if youre feeling ambitious.,FO4mods,d3kzdb5,2,t5_389w4

7862124,0,t1_d3ye0d5,I was actually unaware of the disassembling of K i guess I could add the parts into a container and maybe allow you to recreate K in the medical room where the doctor previously was. I also assumed that the lifespan of a Deathclaw was long enough to last the  years between fallout  and  and I was going to make maybe like a Deathclaw camp outside of Navarro.,FO4mods,d3zrv73,1,t5_389w4
7994394,0,t1_d4elvdl,Thank you kind stranger. I figured itd be a while before those kinds of mods turned up if they ever do since youd basically have to make whatever animal you wanted from scratch.

8060885,0,t1_d4lk38a,Wow. I never would have guessed. That probably wouldve been the very last mod I wouldve tried deactivating. Now it will be the first. I see it listed in many users mod lists. Might we just be unlucky or is it conflicting with another mod? Thanks for your input.,FO4mods,d4m4al2,2,t5_389w4
8555318,0,t3_4wttml,It could be  you are not running the correct version with your version of FO if you just updated to . make sure youve updated shadowboost you have an enb that is conflicting I had that issue and redownloaded enb  which helped have edited the ini in such a way they conflict with shadowboost What I would do if I were you is to  . Remove enbs and shadowboost . Delete move your inis found in documents gtgames gt fallout . Verify the integrity of the cache in steam properties under fallout . Download fresh shadowboost off nexus.

8631044,0,t1_d6kfks0,Ive never actually created a mod or edited specific pieces of them. Ive dabbled in TESEdit for Skyrim to make merged patches and I have a general understanding of how to do that.Hoping I dont have to go too much into it to enjoy what I come up with. Your list is awesome though I am probably going to only use half this list. If I have to go into FOEdit for some musthaves then Ill bite the bullet. Im just trying to avoid it Skyrim I had a shitload of mods and it felt like more work than play to get it stable. With my current work schedule I cant put myself through days of troubleshooting and learning just to play the game unfortunately.,FO4mods,d6khiq0,1,t5_389w4
8813572,0,t3_50vait,If you havent played Survival yet it may be what youre looking for.When FO came out I played for about  hours beat all the quests built settlements etc and got sick of the game.Last month I picked it up and tried on survival mode after hearing tons of fanfare about it and have put another  hours in it is that much fun.I also started the Bethesda games in my childhood with morrowind so I get what youre talking about and while survival doesnt change the quests and backbone of the game it makes playing so much more fun than vanilla. Also I suggest Tales from the Commonwealth a huge WIP mod made by the creators of DNPC for Skyrim in my opinion one of the best mods made for any game. So far its fantastic. Tons of npcs and quests tucked in all over the place so it makes exploring productive.,FO4mods,d779s6s,1,t5_389w4

10813961,0,t3_5ul8rj,The thing I would recommend is to give the Nexus a try. Look around there and browse category filtered by Top of All Time. Mentioning this because the mods you describe are more of minor change so theyre more likely to be included in a larger pack or mod suite. In other words check out Settlement Mods for their popularity then read more into the discription to see if it fits your personal preference. Good look with mods!,FO4mods,ddvdtw3,2,t5_389w4
11086462,0,t1_denvw3g,I like the tier idea. Having ridiculous abilities for niche builds to topout at makes those builds more enticing. Better to increase the level cap and use intermediate ranks to smooth out the power curve than to nerf.,FO4mods,deon2no,2,t5_389w4
