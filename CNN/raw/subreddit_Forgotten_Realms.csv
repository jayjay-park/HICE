1935009,0,t1_ckly09u,Here is all Hack and Slash has on Wave Echo Cave   I was going to change two things .  The Black Spider is an agent of the Cult of the Dragon  to tie it into HOTDQ which I am running next.   .  Forge of Spells  I want it to reward each player with a magic item that has a strength and a weaknessquirk  and make the final battle a bit more interesting.  Maybe some undead dwarf and gnome guardians  who can use the forge like a magic cannon firing energy blasts out of it at the party.  Ive got a few weeks to figure it out.,Forgotten_Realms,ckmcsl0,5,t5_31rpx

2298199,0,t3_2lkclt,I also run a forgotten realms adventure using the Pathfinder rules. The rule are more or less compatible with any third edition adventures you would like to convert Ive converted City of the Spider Queen and a few others. If anything the achetypes alternate classes and rules variants all help to capture the realms style better than DampD did in my opinion.Im even currently running the Pathfinder Kingmaker adventure in the Realms at the moment with little trouble. Ive even made it a bit more of a challenge for myself by setting it in the Underdark.Get stuck in. Once you forget about the rules difference you can just enjoy using the setting even more.,Forgotten_Realms,clvruko,2,t5_31rpx
2310651,0,t1_clwh671,Well as its turning out they really just wanna start the faerun game as low level ish adventurers so Im probably not gonna use modules just stick them somewhere cliche like the sword coast or the dales and work from there. Especially after running them through the demon within and finding so so so many errors not the least of which being that only about a third of it was actually converted,Forgotten_Realms,clxb941,3,t5_31rpx
3042900,0,t3_2uqxih,I think that doom of daggerdale is a very solid and fun module I also have to put forward the starter module from the old greybox Beneath the Twisted Tower. The first had a good bit of investigation and uncovery that got the players roped up into the mysteries of the town the second was a very fun dungeon delve with some very clever encounters and traps. I think the biggest issue Id had with the first one is that you will have to thoroughly read it so you know how it all links together so you can be prepared to run your players through when they deviate from the script! For the second I had an issue with the apparent length of the dungeon. I found a good solution by letting my players use section b or c the waterfall outside as a good exit and reentry point to the deeper dungeons!,Forgotten_Realms,code9bc,2,t5_31rpx

5294587,0,t1_cvo2tck,I wish!  Of the  setting specific books Ive read through around  of them.  Im a slow reader to begin with paired with the fact that I usually fall asleep the second I lay down in bed at night means that it takes me forever to get through a book. And since my two boys were born the free time I had during the day to read has been filled with other stuff.  So for the past few years Ive been slacking big time. Just a matter of not enough hours in the day.  Im trying though.  I actually just started reading Evermeet Island of Elves and because of a thread posted here a week or two ago I decided to try and write down every character in the book just to see how many there.  If Im able to remember and be consistent I may decide to do it for every FR book I read in the future. You know for science.,Forgotten_Realms,cvog152,6,t5_31rpx

6813255,0,t1_d0o89c4,I have to disagree with you on your first point. I thought it did a fairly good job of exploring the different ways drow can seek redemption or a more moral way of life admittedly based on generically good principles through magic or religion while still retaining their drowishness. I saw the transformation of those without the demonic bloodline as the turning of people who if given the chance would have rather not be born drow and would have liked the chance to live as an elf apart from their previous race while those with the taint were still able to seek a good life with the appropriate reward while reveling in their drowishness. The very end game of removing gods was disappointing to me only in that we dont get to see what happens next and whether Eilistraees followers were capable of being good without god. It would have been a nice parallel to Lloths priestesses turning over to Eilistraee during the time of silence had some of Eilistraees flock turned to new gods for power while some remained faithful and powerless. The High Magic was a deux ex machina but that doesnt bother me too much in the context of FR books. However Im totally with you in that new showdowns in the pantheon based off new allies has some sweet potential.   ,Forgotten_Realms,d0okvp0,2,t5_31rpx

11310879,0,t1_dfe1nrj,So lets start by saying I am not gay I am straight and white I am also married so they dont come more heteronormative than I do.Now I come from a background where I have several gay friends along with having known several transgender people. This originally came to me during a talk about Mizhena and how poorly that was received. I was interested in other games based in the realms because I imagined that BioWare would have put more of this into NWN and Baldurs Gate. If you look at Dragon Age Jade Empire Mass Effect and Knights of the Old Republic these characters are well rounded and not tokenized. Something that a lof of people said about MizhenaSo I started searching and found stuff like this and thisAnd thisBased on this I said the state was sad.And to deconstruct your reply here a bitYou were given numerous examples of LBGQT charactersNo I have actually been given mostly B characters. There is one callout for a G character Laeheo but he is also married and has kids so thats not really a good example I would argue. ,Forgotten_Realms,dfe2k1g,-5,t5_31rpx
