771842,0,t3_22doaw, Organizers bots are used in the CI Browser On your own machine against public game servers. There will be limitations on how many rounds you can run which well clarify later on. Simple we dont have the infrastructure ready yet. Just the bot code is needed The rules are sparse because we dont want to resort to US style EULAs. Common sense should be enough and if needed well ask for the communitys opinion. If he manages to get to the finals he must have a valid passport.,HWO,cgs0guc,1,t5_310ar

807870,0,t1_cgv2esc,Think of a real car. Setting throttle to . merely means youre pushing the gas pedal all the way. That doesnt mean it will immediately reach that speed. The speed is dependent on several factors such as the engine and the road.,HWO,cgw3xvw,1,t5_310ar
819306,0,t1_cgxedm8,Ok ty. That sounds fair enough. Sry for being hard maybe Im a bit tired after coding  days a row and then that first answer made me think that all my work was for nothing. Good to know that it isnt so. ,HWO,cgxeoib,1,t5_310ar

827362,0,t1_cgyajbf,Its just over. I have repeatedly verified it out to  decimal places and its about .Its not a straight line from start to end as would be expected by sqrt  .. Try predicting your speed and calculate the value from your inPieceDistances.,HWO,cgybmlr,2,t5_310ar

859974,0,t1_ch20q5x,Same here I was excited to try and see how far I would get by making a bot using Genetic Programming which is what the OP was doing and was disappointed when I discovered the game server could nit be run locally.I invested some time in writing my own game server but figured that given the length of the competition and the time I had available to myself it would not be viable.I was actually surprised how responsive the servers turned out to be and eventually bolted a genetic algorithm environment onto my bot and let it collect data on all tracks.,HWO,ch218ga,1,t5_310ar
870159,0,t3_243dzi,The server will wait until other bots use joinRace with similar parameters and start the race when there are enough bots. You can run multiple instances of your own bot against each other. Or you go to freenode irc hwo channel to find opponents. Or just make a race and wait until someone joins.,HWO,ch36wm9,1,t5_310ar
870952,0,t1_ch2unnf,gt ver is that the centrifugal force has a cutoff value meaning it doesnt count under a certain value which you can oWhy are you sampling first and second derivatives at earlier ticks?Anyway this resembles the way we tried to approximate sliding however the same equation gives different constants if solved in tick  or tick  or any later tick in the same corner while traveling at the same speed which suggests that theyre not actually constants.,HWO,ch3a59p,2,t5_310ar

894409,0,t1_ch5y50o,Hmm actually maybe team names were unique... You could name you bot test or anything nonunique if you wanted to I guess. So I guess color is best indeed. Or weird team names edit brings another interesting game the system trick actually... can probably confuse a lot of teams by using the same botname... ,HWO,ch5y5mv,1,t5_310ar
1031697,0,t1_chl5c0q,I have trust in CS guys that they will figure out what I want to know although I dont know it yet Heres some things I would like to see Some kind of bot performances counted from race total and fastest lap times. Did different regions use same variables in qualifications so are times comparable with all regions? I would like to know that team actually managed to make functional bot. This could be maybe checked from that bot actually finished at least  race in qualifications? Bot reliability could be checked from on how many races bot did finishdnf. If bot had lots of dnfs in qualification but participated in wild card then only wild card round could be used for this. Then some basic language comparisons. Which were most successful in test run global rankings. How many bots from each language made to round    etc.,HWO,chlk4vq,1,t5_310ar
