346387,0,t3_1xl236,I love the new Predators. That breacher hits like a TRUCK. Two of those shots to the face and its byebye pesky Beserker.Not to mention people tend to pay less attention to the glowing outline in the heat of battle...

391261,0,t1_cfl186g,Well I have tried a lot of different mechs but so far I have gotten great results on the reaper.. stayin back and laying down suppression fire and getting a good angle on the enemy and picking them off for it.. I like the range.. I wish i could do a bit more dmg though.. takes quite awhile to kill someone for me. Also I have used the berserker as well and did well.. flying in and blasting their face and flying out.. but I didnt realize they had a flying bonus? I usually only play berserker on small maps and stick to reaper when I have a bigger map to work with.. I am open to ideas though since those two are the only ones iv put time in. thanks man. ,Hawken,cflbj5j,1,t5_2sd9a
404643,0,t1_cfmpah9,Ive been having a hard time getting my scout to close the distance and then immediately escape after shotgunning an opponent.  PreSteam the scout was one of my best mechs and if anything I considered it OP because it was too easy getting in and out of firefights but now its the opposite.As for the bruiser in the time it takes for the hellfire missiles to lock onto an enemy my hp has already dropped down at least a third of its full life.

572051,0,t1_cg59vvt,Thanks! Hellfire missiles are pretty much what sets the Bruiser apart from the assault or other bclass mechs for that matter. If you try to play the Bruiser like you would an Assault youre probably gonna have a bad time.The simple act of locking onto someone especially someone who is already taking fire is oftentimes enough to trigger the gtfo instinct in their minds. You can use this to your advantage by creating the illusion of great danger to the enemy and effectively close off their standard avenues of attack as a result. ,Hawken,cg5ape5,3,t5_2sd9a

641356,0,t3_21gqkh, I like to jump and fire down at their feet whenever I can but a direct shot will always do more damage if you are accurate enough. Depends how good you are at dodging really. Scout has the second lowest armour pool in the game and will fall over if someone sneezes forcefully at you. I consider them more of the assassin time bursting enemies and getting out. Dont know Use the TOW when closing in switch to the flak in close range and finish them off with a TOW when necessary.  Too many reasons as to why that might be happening. If youre boosting into a fight as opposed to walking chances are youre already low on fuel before you even start.

I am wondering what could Hawken even offer me beyond what I already mentioned?So... what I want to know is is the Hawken Universe going to expand lore wise and gameplay wise? Why beyond supporting the new devs should I spend any money when the first time I got burned so hard by the first devs? Now for the farfetched most likely not happening questions but will you guys be adding anything cool in like combined arms as can be seen in War Thunder?

6936060,0,t1_d122qcl,Read all the posts in that that thread instead of calling me a liar with your baseless accusation.Edit Or better yet contact the person that loss their position on that forum.,Hawken,d12j2hr,1,t5_2sd9a
7206525,0,t3_4aj1m6,Stuff like this isnt helping the game.If anything it points to a bunch of its flaws.,Hawken,d1xbozj,1,t5_2sd9a
7659954,0,t1_d3c4git,There is but... dude learn mouse and keyboard. Games are stomps as it is and there is a grand total of one good player on controller in this game. The aoes are large but they are not AC large.,Hawken,d3cw5xp,1,t5_2sd9a
7865545,0,t1_d404izg,Upvote for making me laugh. Would have liked a tumbleweed more though. ,Hawken,d405r7k,2,t5_2sd9a
7937637,0,t3_4nzdgu,I mean itd be nice.  But Reloaded has long long since burned through what good will they once had.   new mechs huh? Thats nice. Lets see some evidence beyond some pretty pictures on a website and a console announcement.,Hawken,d489ke1,3,t5_2sd9a
8117963,0,t1_d4sfe8r,Yup. The devs appear to have very selective hearing.  Eight hours of playing Hawken and they agreed with some noobs that different mech silhouettes made the game confusing.  Despite the fact that theres a GLOWING BOX WITH THE MECH SYMBOL HOVERING AROUND THEM.  ,Hawken,d4sj5qh,2,t5_2sd9a
8143051,0,t3_4qq4aa,What kind of splash damage does that weapon have? If its anything like the TOW missile then this would be ridiculous in close clustered hallways and bunkers. Just spray and pray a barrage of explosives into a stackedup team.,Hawken,d4vfdxj,2,t5_2sd9a
8145208,0,t1_d4volvp,Its also taking fire from the berzerker on the left.  Im not particularly worried about facing this POS. The seeker is fundamentally a bad weapon and putting two of them on a mech that fragile is a terrible idea. A berserker will eat this thing alive.,Hawken,d4vp45i,4,t5_2sd9a
8165022,0,t1_d4y60na,Brawler is a great introduction to piloting Cclass mechs. Being so slow and tanky you need to learn to pick your engagements since getting out isnt always an option.,Hawken,d4y6df2,1,t5_2sd9a
8178037,0,t1_d4wqtpg,The game turned into a quake clone. shrug I reinstalled it tonight to see if it got better uninstalled after two matches. Everything that made me fall in love with Hawken is gone.,Hawken,d4zsykv,3,t5_2sd9a
8190178,0,t1_d51b28r,Mfw no more flak scout,Hawken,d51bnya,3,t5_2sd9a
8209491,0,t1_d53qn44,Still seems more like a screw you than anything useful.I guess it changes the way people play around you makes them more cautious? ,Hawken,d53qp3o,1,t5_2sd9a
8231394,0,t1_d56f9wk,Son you need to get an eye exam,Hawken,d56hb5z,2,t5_2sd9a
8307257,0,t3_4tb3ju,Howd you get these shots? In game? Old promotional material?,Hawken,d5fypcc,2,t5_2sd9a
8414622,0,t3_4uj08j,I could log in last night... but now I cannot again.  Jeebus!,Hawken,d5tddlq,1,t5_2sd9a
8443281,0,t1_d5w2ecv,Yeah Ive found a nief that knows how to use flying is much more dangerous than one just dodging on the ground.I suppose the same could be said for all mechs  but when I have one jump over me  while using the special ability I just end up shredded.,Hawken,d5wy5y2,1,t5_2sd9a
8478678,0,t1_d5wy5y2,Why would you even bother staying on the ground when your weapons auto aim.The most dangerous jumping dodge mech is a heat cannon scout. It doesnt even need to stay still for a second since both weapons are burst guns.,Hawken,d61dlh6,1,t5_2sd9a
8797985,1,t1_d75cwr1,And planning to port console to pc and fuck us over even more.,Hawken,d75ebrg,2,t5_2sd9a
8817357,0,t1_d76oegn,Cheers that has saved me wasting more hours!,Hawken,d77q5zn,2,t5_2sd9a
8996682,0,t1_d7suryh,Thank goodness! Glad these shitheads see fit to control the toxic rabble that is the finest and most reasonable gaming community Ive been party to in my decades of online comp shooters.YOU THINK YOU CAN JOKE AROUND WITH A POLL?!A POLL?!YOU THINK THIS IS GAEM?!you fucking menace,Hawken,d7t9fl7,1,t5_2sd9a
10156418,0,t3_5l7mud,Lag in the arm control is evident even in this gif its teathered at all times and the strides look worse than those of the Honda Asimov robot that is several years old. Our soon timeline here is probably a decade.,Hawken,dbvabjo,3,t5_2sd9a
10708500,0,t1_ddk9k6f,Damn filter is clearly not tight enough,Hawken,ddki2eb,2,t5_2sd9a
11281814,0,t1_dfan3p3,Well Im  MMR and Ive been having trouble,Hawken,dfarzbb,1,t5_2sd9a
11342411,0,t3_61vnfd,Less than  for any given platform.  Pick your poison.    More accurate PC stats.,Hawken,dfhn54f,9,t5_2sd9a
11434786,0,t1_dfs432o,so the  slotted internal which reduces your skill cooldown for using niefs ability that makes him really dangerous isnt considered a good choice for internal?Anyway its hard to find which mechs are actually good on console right now in the meta. Most documents are from the pc players and are from  years ago and outdated.,Hawken,dfs4e0i,1,t5_2sd9a
