Most languages have a web framework of choice which will help you serve a web application much like how Jsoup is helping you scrape the web Ive asked around a few friends and they seem to say the best place to start is with the Play framework or Spark so I would take a look at both of those and see which one best fits your requirements.,WebApps,d2sgu3e,2,t5_2qk4z
11514051,0,t3_647w9i,Im just gonna blast these out. The html is all over the place. You cant have  body and heads dude  The css seems to have errors also. I can scroll on the x axis and for some reason there is a static block on the right which will be causing this. This is what happens when you use bootslap link   errors and a missing dependency shown in browser dev tools. No SSL. Does Godaddy make use of Lets Encrypt? Or are they just being crap? Page speed indicates a few problems also. You might need thisRoasted!EDIT Try this ,WebApps,dg14b1p,1,t5_2qk4z
