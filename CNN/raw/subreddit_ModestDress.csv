2239459,0,t1_clohcww,Thank you! I made a post over on rhijabis asking for some advice about broaching the topic with my husband. We are Christian and live in a liberal area but its still the US and I know that choosing to veil will have ramifications for my whole family. Im just feeling very nervous!,ModestDress,clohls3,2,t5_349de

3423149,0,t3_2zexvx,Physical Neck to toes whether that means a turtleneck and a fulllength skirt a shirtcami combo with a kneelength skirt and tights or anything in between.  If Im wearing a long skirt I dont wear tights or nylons so the tops of my feet often show when Im walking but thats not as much of an issue to me.  I would love to wear more scarflike head coverings but my husband loves my hair so I compromised with thick headbands Im actually wearing a really adorable knitted one right now!  Ill have to take a picture.  I prefer  length sleeves but Im not against tshirts as long as they have a high neckline and arent tight.  Im a little less stringent about shoes  I will probably wear flip flops and sandals in the summer along with tennis shoes.Mentalspiritual Actually a lot of my changes came about after reading a book called the Surrendered Wife.  I want to spend my life serving my husband and family and I realized that my former wardrobe was a very easy way to draw unwanted attention to myself.  Ive started being more open to things trying less to take control  Ive realized how much of my life was devoted to things other than my family and Im trying to change that for the better.  As for biting my tongue well get in a car with me when Im behind someone driving mph under the speed limit on a day without bad weather snow storm horrible wind etc and youll see exactly why I havent given that a shot.
