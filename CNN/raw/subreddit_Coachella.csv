I had tickets to a show of his this past summer and I couldnt go so I was really banking on him being at Coachella. I do think that there is a bit much overlap from previous lineups. This will only be my th Coachella and I have seen some of these bands AT coachella before. But when it is a band like Arcade Fire I am totally fine seeing them on the polo fields again. I wish it had been Pixies or even NIN over Muse but I used to like Muse and I am sure they will play some of the older stuff. I havent seen them live since they played a small stage at The Curiosa Festival in  wow I am dating myself here. And Id rather have Muse than Kanye KoL Mumford etc etc.I bought my ticket at the presale because I knew that barring the worst lineup ever I want to go to Coachella. It is ALWAYS a good time.

Apparently the companion parking lot is right across the street.

759497,0,t3_22uclh,To those saying this set needed to just be the big hits in a word no. This is a th anniversary retrospective show and they should have and did play tracks from their entire career. A lot of people know Outkast from Hey Ya and Ms. Jackson but they were already established stars in hip hop before either of those songs came out. I would have been much more disappointed if their performance was primarily focused on Stankonia and SpeakerboxxThe Love Below.I enjoyed the first half of the set a lot and where I was in the crowd there was a lot of energy. B.O.B. to Gasoline Dreams to ATLiens to Skew It on the BarB to Rosa Parks was high energy and hook driven. All five deserve to be big widely known hits and I thought the delivery was solid.I enjoy Da Art of Storytellin Part  Aquemini and SpottieOttieDopaliscious but if I were them I wouldnt have clustered the songs together like they did. For a late night festival show at least one high energy song every  minutes is helpful. Thats even more true for hip hop.Big Bois solo set was pretty good and Janelle Monae nailed it was I the only one that started screaming when Big Boi asked the Android to come to the stage?. I could have done without Kryptonite but thats recoverable.Andre s solo set felt phoned in and I just dont think the songs he played stand up to the rest of Outkasts catalog.I dont know Futures music well and his performance didnt inspire me to learn more. Having Andres solo stuff transition into Future was a big mood shift in my part of the crowd. That was a long stretch of music not necessary for a th anniversary concert. The big Outkast fans dont care about Futures album this month. The casual fans maybe even less so.Those two tracks could have been The Whole World with Killer Mike whom I love and was hoping would guest and Players Ball which I suspect they intended on being their closing track.Ms. Jackson So Fresh So Clean The Way You Move and Hey Ya are pretty much the big big widely known singles of course. Ending with them is an ok approach but they may have kept the mixed crowd going stronger if they interspersed them throughout the set.And as mentioned above the big oversight was no Players Ball. I suspect they intended on playing but just ran out of time. I had a great time but when the history of this tour is written this performance will not be seen as the highlight of their reunion. Weekend  folks will be lucky. I suspect theyll get a better show. I have no regrets about getting up close for this performance. The first half hour was exactly what I hoped for and Im glad I was there for it.,Coachella,cgqm0o5,30,t5_2qsp9

This apparently enrages people who dont want to think about how pervasive advertising is on the internet.  Why would you even engage with me if youre so disinterested?But this ISNT advertising you might say.... to which i say I know... im not trying to say it is... Ive conceded numerous times that it isnt.    Im just saying that crazier shit has turned out to be advertising in the past so you cant simply dismiss things at face value so easily.  Its not advertising because these bands arent available to the general public?  So what?  Its still got the coachella logo on it and people are seeing sharing it and wanting to know more about it...  Thats called advertisement.   The justifications for why this WASNT advertising just werent robust enough for me.  Ive seen numerous occurrences on reddit play out where people were SURE something wasnt an image from an advertisement that later turned out to absolutely be one.   But whatever fuck me if you guys are so not into it dont reply to me sheesh.  Its a pretty simple concept.  Im not forcing anyone to read my ramblings.  All I can say is Youre advertised to x more often than you even realize and its worth knowing about and thinking about.  Or you can just get butthurt and rage like all these other people.

ACDC are not musical aficionados by any means but their music has an undeniable aesthetic which is why they are shoved down our throats in every direction pump up songs at sporting events commercials movies.  They represent an attitudeemotion.  Coachella surely could have found a more relevant headliner with wider appeal for the current face of music but at least ACDC will be a sloppy drunken singalong.Creed and Nickelback are devoid of all of those things.,Coachella,cnihgjy,7,t5_2qsp9

The last time they toured the in LA they were playing The Wiltern and they were still selling tickets at the door. The band  especially Sergio Pizzorno  has so much energy live though! If their set at Coachella this year is anything like their set in  or their aformentioned set at the Wiltern which shameless plug I shot theyre sure to kill it!

Better yet bring a solar charger that you can leave connected to a battery while youre at the festival in case your buddies want to charge too. If you have a phone with a replaceable battery bring however many extras you can scrounge up. A headlamp for setting up your spot at night is also a good idea. Even if you get there in the middle of the day it might take some time to clear security and get fully set up if you have a large group. Portable showers and solar lanterns dont hurt either. Make sure you stake your tents and canopies firmly into the ground if you can get those corkscrew stakes even better. Ask anyone who went Coachella  Weekend  the winds there can be brutal.As for food they have a ton of that in the campgrounds so you dont even necessarily need to bring entire meals there but its a good way to save money. ,Coachella,cno0ibg,5,t5_2qsp9

As much as I love him seeing him in LA for both shows he plays a very setup oriented live show that I dont think would work at the DoLab.  He sings live plays the piano plus other instrumentstriggering I think and basically improvs each show as it happens.Maybe if he closed out the DoLab one night similar to TEED although he wasnt live.

3120304,0,t3_2vvv2t, When sending a meet up text to your friends put the time youre sending the text and never say meet you in x minutes. It can take  minutes for a text to send sometimes during peek festival hours.  The phone charging stations are pretty weak put it on airplane mode or turn it off before charging to speed the process Check out the promotional tents! They have cool shit and air conditioning and sometimes you can find outlets to charge your phone  Sunscreen and water. Seriously. Security checks are really inconsistent it all depends on how thorough the guard is. If you have stuff to hide hang back a little before picking a line and try to go with someone who checks fast. Some people will make you open every zipper and some people will just glance in your bag. If you get an easy checker the first day dont assume youll get an easy checker the next two. If they find shit though dont stress they usually just throw it away and let you go. ,Coachella,colf30n,6,t5_2qsp9

3299899,0,t1_cp4bpih,Thanks for the link. In another response OP stated that he doesnt have any real world comparison between the two and it was merely based on the graphs provided by the manufacturer. I still prefer DUBS especially on a comfort level. I actually found that the Etymotics drowned out a lot high and mid tones and left me with mostly bass. Im not ignoring the science. Im just saying from personal experience the DUBS gave me better sound quality with enough protection to not have my ears ringing by the end of the night. Edit a little more science behind the DUBS. Apparently how we determine loudness is heavily dependent on frequency of the sound. Our ears are highly sensitive to frequencies between kHzkHz due to the closed tube resonance of the auditory canal As you can see with DUBS attenuation graph they try to provide the most protection at these frequencies while mainting less protection at the lower frequencies to preserve human speech which ranges from Hz to Hz,Coachella,cp4ey3y,1,t5_2qsp9

3676407,0,t1_cqb4tpu,Believe it or not hip hop is the greatest common music denominator now and is the  something that MOST of the attendees can enjoy and they did. I mean Drake has a song where he says he is as big as Madonna in the s because its true. His last MIXTAPE meaning songs that werent even good enough to make the official album tied THE BEATLES record for most songs on the charts at one time literally the entire  song project charted. Look it up im not exaggerating. Drake isnt some popular niche artist that could be relegated to the Outdoor stage. So finding someone to perform that appealed to the most people is EXACTLY what the promoters did maybe you personally didnt like it which is fine but the majority of people did. Dont think for a second that rcoachella is indicative of your average coachella goer sorry to say but you and others here arent the target demographic anymore the festival has changed.. The age here tends to skew way older than the average attendee for a reason which also explains why a good amount of people here dont like Drake in the first place. ,Coachella,cqbc1qs,0,t5_2qsp9

3687913,0,t1_cqcd0b8,Just to consider even if you arrange something beforehand youre still going to have to meet someone who has been at Coachella. Someone who has been partying for a few days probably going pretty hard. You have to arrange a time and place to meet this person. This person is going to have their own world of shit to deal with including traffic and their own travel companions  their issues.  Its a web of things that can fuck up a planJust that at am on a Saturday or am on a Sunday even if they arent already flakes I assume youve boughtsold on craigslist before... and even if they can physically and logistically make it where they are supposed to on time suddenly that  may not seem as enticing as it did  days earlier.  Or maybe someone standing right outside the fest offered them more or less! and they figured they dont owe you shit.Given a random seller i wouldnt put odds much above  to actually pull of the transaction.  I understand your hesitation but just heading down has a high chance of success. Even if you pull of a craigslist deal down there at least youre not dealing with someone who may be wasted in a couple days.Or maybe make sure you buy from someone who is staying at a hotel or something to make it easier to meet. You show up on time all they have to do is wakeup.Their will be a lot of wristbands available.  A lot of people just cant stay through Sunday.Tldr arranging a meeting is hell.

Myself M my brother M and his girlfriend F are looking for some well rounded folk that would be interested in being neighbors for weekend  car camping.  We have two camping passes for the three of us but were undecided if we want to splurge on a second rental car to occupy the second space or sell off the extra camping pass.  We have all of our own supplies so were covered there.  With the right group wed be willing to offer up that second space as part of a shared camp bring a second canopy etc.  One requirement is that you would be arriving as soon as gates open very early Thursday morning so we can get a close spot in lot  as that is our plan.About usProudly representing DenverVermontChicago.

6271054,0,t1_cz2e1ii,Part of it was that Riotfest had relatively poor production not Cubes fault.  But no live instruments at all automatically makes most rap sets mediocre.  His DJ wasnt doing much mixing or scratching at all just play the track and Cube raps over it with a hype man.  Screens in the background playing music video graphics at best.  There was absolutely nothing distinguishing or exceptional about it.  Just lazy and predictable.Ive seen far too many rap sets exactly like it and that setup is just a recipe for crap.  Jay Z in  and Dre in  were examples of how to do a rap set right.  Of course they were getting paid millions so they could pour it into production and a band.  If Cube can take advantage of the great production Coachella has maybe hell put together something big with some amazing guests.  God I hope so because I love his catalog.But if its at all similar to the show hes been touring for the last decade its going to be a letdown.

Most sets have lots of room and its warm and sunny and everyone is happy and less fucked up than at night. Obviously some acts just dont work well in the daytime I have no idea what the fuck Coachella was thinking putting Perfume Genius on Outdoor at  pm last year though he still killed it but those that do can be very magical. Jenny Lewis last year was just absolutely perfect in the afternoon sun. I think Miami Horror will be much the same.,Coachella,d07vejp,1,t5_2qsp9

I say LOCAL because you should essentially activate wristbands together when you make the exchange in person. This doesnt guarantee anything as the original seller could cancel the wristband saying it was stolen but it gives you the best chance at a smooth transaction because you could cancel the other wristband. Just my two cents.. If youre traveling to the festival alone I would try and buddy up with people from your town and get in on their camp with some money provided hopefully but this way you know the people and dont have to deal with the uncertainty of the wristband swap.

7141358,0,t3_4dbrkr,okay. i have  kids  now  and . ive been taking them to festivals since they were  and . youre right. roo is WAY more sketchy and yet has more kids and a family camping area. culturally however kids are way more frowned upon at coachella in my experience. parents get a lot of shit for it and ive seen it. one afternoon a cool mom with a  year old son with those awesome kid headphones was in tears because of the weird shit she encountered. i chilled with her for a while and told her fuck them but truly since the crowd is younger there is a general attitude that their good times are being infringed upon because a kid is nearby. i didnt take my daughter until she was  but that was mostly because coachella is my place to be independent and have a good time with no strings. SO i would say you clearly know the drill coachella is the cleanest safest most organized secure least publically intoxicated festival ever. but as youve noted it just the late night zombie crowdscrush that id avoid. hell we do that as adults. we hang until they bring up the lights and the snowplows for the bottles lol. this year im taking both of my kids who are adults as far as im concerned. i can tell you a lifetime of having that type of open communication with your kids makes some pretty transparent and honest offspring. kudos to you!,Coachella,d1pw9nn,2,t5_2qsp9

7305095,0,t1_d28j71c,Ive done a shitty hotel that was far away rented a big ass house with a bunch of people and camping and IMO camping was the most fun.This is because the afterhours atmosphere for the most part considering the Silent Disco and the chillin tent plus food options is pretty sweet and the daytime stuff like the Jive Joint is really cool as well.  The problem with car camping is just that generally I find our neighbors to be pretty annoying old man syndrome kicking in I guess.  The disadvantage of a house from my experience is generally the logistics of getting people and the money together which obviously varies by group as well as the drivingparkingwalking or uberingwalking time each day to and from the festival.Additionally camping allows you to go in during the day in shorts and flip flops and then come out in the evening to change into slightly warmer clothes and pregame again.,Coachella,d28jgfn,5,t5_2qsp9

I planned to cook a bit but the food on sale was good especially in the camping area so one canister was fine.

You dont need a permit the hotel is pretty much by itself. There is nothing but sand till you get past the frwy on the other side of the bridge.

The Vegas thing just illustrates that theres A LOT more money on the table. Coachella is a brand. They could just not replace Beyonce and still sell out for the next five years.

And I think the pricing breakdown is kinda off too.  for a car campsite right? And youre charging each of the individuals  rather than splitting that cost evenly among those who come. If you had four people in addition to you that would be  per person for the campsite. So youre charging everyone  for a ride electricity and refrigeration. Yeah an Uber would be more expensive but shuttle passes would not be nor would finding friends in the carpool thread. Phone charging stations are everywhere and a portable or solar charger goes for  on amazon. And ice is  a bag and the cost of storage space in a car for an ice chest.

Coachella has never had different headliners for different weekends so there is literally zero precedent for this to happen.C. There is definitely an inherent cost savings when booking the same act for two weekends. For example if an act costs k for one show you might get them for k for two at the same venue.

A view from my lot  spot There are pros and cons to both. In lot  the obvious youre right next to the entrance gates. I was literally a  second walk or less from the entrance. This made it easy to go back to camp if I forgot something just wanted to go back and chill time to eat whatever. The downside for me though was the fact that the bathrooms took me awhile to get to as well as the showers. The bathrooms took me a good  mins to get to. Not too bad but I still didnt like that part. The showers took me  mins to get to because they were in lot  hr ones or I could go to the ones in lot . Now in lot  it takes me about  mins to get to the entrance and about a minute or two to get to the showers and the bathrooms since I was halfway between the two. I also liked being close to the lighthouse as that was a nice way to end the nights. Im shooting for lot  this year but hoping to get closer to the bathrooms lol and we brought our own shower this time around. Its definitely nice not having to walk very far in case you forgot something or if you just needed a break.But with that you also dont want to be planning on coming back into the festival at a time when an artist you want to see is about to start since everyone else is doing the same thing. Security lines can get crazy sometimes. Sometimes can take almost  mins to get in.I cant speak for the other lots but Ive heard theyre not fantastic. ,Coachella,df8akuy,3,t5_2qsp9

I would argue this is the best place on the internet to discuss drug usage at Coachella and get firsthand advice from those with the most experience.

Activating it on your app does not in any way remotely turn on the wristband. It only ties your legal name to it. ,Coachella,dgivcdm,1,t5_2qsp9

11725380,0,t1_dgp2iw6,Yeah people here are strange re Depeche Mode.Regarding JT I lead off with saying that if he were to be on the lineup it would be due to a certain reinvention that would allow  pop headliners. Hes coheadlining a festival with Eddie Vedder which leads me to believe hes moving in a rockguitar oriented direction. I dont think he would headline same lineup with Beyonce if his music is more of the sexybacksuit and tie type music because that def would be too pop oriented. Thanks im pretty fully recovered. Sorry we didnt meet up again once the festival gets going its hard to coordinate a time to meet up without missing certain acts. Hell I never even got my drink from uadarkpassenger and it wasnt due to lack of trying on either of our parts. Thatll have to wait till next year ,Coachella,dgp3oy3,5,t5_2qsp9
