40195,0,t1_ceiuiuz,There is one picture of a facing with eyelets but it is described comprehensively in the text. A thousand words if you will...   The photo of the silk strip is on page . From p Metal buttons made from tin pewter bronze and brass have also been recovered from th and thcentury deposits in London Egan and Pritchard  but by contrast to cloth buttons none now remain attached to any item of clothing. This is perhaps because they were attached in a different way indeed shanks at the back of the metal buttons suggest that they could have been moved from garment to garment by the simple expedient of setting the button shank through a worked eyelet hole and passing a lace down the back of the eyelets and through the shank a technique well attested in surviving clothing of the th century and by earlier visual evidence. Indeed this may hav ebeen the purpose of the silk eyelets Fig  and would explain why they show no stresslines from tension. Fig  Detail of eyelet holes on a silk facing and associated strip of silk No  from a deposit dating to the late th century A front note traces of the woollen cloth to which the facing was originally stitched are visible round the eylet in the centre. ...The now fragmentary strip is mm long and mm wide it has narrow turnings along the long edges to one of which is still attached a folded length of similar silk. A companion strip of silk facing mm long and mm wide has been held in place by runningstitches on three edges and by two equally spaced lines of stitching extending the full length of the strip. The eyelet strip has six eyelets still intact evenly placed mm apart. They are worked in twoply silk thread the overstitching of each hole being achieved by two complete circuits of buttonholestitch Fig . After the completion of each eyelet the sewing thread was carried up the back of the work to the next eyelet hole. A sufficiently long sewing thread seems tohave been used to complete all six surviving eyelets. The eyelets show no sign of wear nor indeed does the strip itself appear to have been used or fastened under tension but traces of a woolllen fabric remain round one eyelet. This suggests that the strips come froma loose garment a supertunic for example.,HistoricalCostuming,cej09ll,1,t5_2ubp5
731492,0,t1_cgnbkit,Well first which region of Ireland do you want to represent and which century? If I base myself on your other post about that costume youre aiming for the th century and west of Galway.So what research on your costume have you done? From what sources is it inspired from?A quick google search about the fashion in Ireland during the th century shows that it was on par with the general fashion in europe that was popular at the time trending more towards english fashion. So unless people in the west of Galway were still at the beginning of the iron age your costume isnt accurate at all.Nope Im afraid in Ireland during the th century the current fashion revolved around wollen hoses and doublets like in most countries.Id recommend reading this document  and try to find a copy of the medieval tailors assistant. It should give you a good basis.,HistoricalCostuming,cgnfall,1,t5_2ubp5

3680923,0,t1_cqbgzt5,Yup Baron Wars is a biggie and is held in my hometown so I always remember it. Not sure of the dates this year. But Fort Meigs where it is held in Perrysburg Ohio also has a slew of other events ranging from  to Civil War to ALL with their Muster on the Maumee event. I guess some might not consider that Midwest as we are the eastern end of midwest but we do fall into the Midrealm and other events in Ohio are listed above. ,HistoricalCostuming,cqbul0c,2,t5_2ubp5

4657753,0,t1_cthhtwv,Just to tag onto this...while it can be okay to deviate some from historical accuracy as long as youre not entering into ArtSci its not always a good idea.  People in history wore what they wore because it was durable costeffective and looked good according to their own aesthetic note that those priorities are ordered. We generally want the same things out of our own garb and modern invented methods arent guaranteed to give us that.As a general rule I encourage anyone who wants to use a modern concession to really think about how it will affect the function of the garment.  Some concessions are unavoidable insulin pump access for instance but its always a good idea to understand what the original did that the modern concession might not and viceversa.,HistoricalCostuming,ctho1fb,4,t5_2ubp5
5597561,0,t3_3rr9vv,Thanks for all the comments! I had a poke around a local fabric store at lunch and found a nice if maybe too shiny? striped taffeta but first I think Ill test my abilities on something basic before taking a run at the pretty stuff. To recap Im looking for something light but with enough body to puff about as required crisp enough to hold a pleat but not so bulky as to make construction a nightmare preferably wool cotton or silk.
