208675,0,t1_cf27etn,I understood what your saying and what I am saying is the gasket was already clearly visible that it was torn before I even took the IAC off. The IAC itself is not the problem.,MustangTech,cf27miy,2,t5_2x91t

960728,0,t3_253o6y,if its otherwise running great you dont have vibration and so on  get under the car in the rear and look for swaybar end links that are loose exhaust hitting the rear end mine barely touches btw its close where the loops go over the axle etc.  Same in the front  look for swaybar links that are loose.  Inspect the entire exhaust  you might have broken a hanger for example.   Hope you find it.,MustangTech,chdhsch,4,t5_2x91t
1096923,0,t1_chstvy6,The rack bushings are a  minute swap at most. The steering shift is about an hour or so. Maximum motors ports also has a nice full metal shift upgrade for our cars too.,MustangTech,chsz3f9,1,t5_2x91t

1519146,0,t3_2bm0y3,Im guessing some fuel related problem due to your manifold installation. Remove all of your fuel injectors check the tips for chips or cracks check the tips for obstructions too. If any injectors look funny replace them. Then reset your batterycomputer and see how it runs. ,MustangTech,cj6p9zr,1,t5_2x91t
1559348,0,t3_2c1pdn,No its not that simple or cheap.  Youd be better off either building a motor or just buying a GT.  If youre really mechanically inclines then look up all the GT parts buy them gut the GT and replace it with those GT parts tune test have fun.No matter how you do this it wont be cheap and probably wont be worth it.Not only will you need new internals buy youll need new externals too think calipers brakes etc.,MustangTech,cjbqkaw,1,t5_2x91t

3454877,0,t3_2zt5kt,The only thing that makes a Mustang worthy of cobra badges is if it left the factory with them in the first place. But thats just my opinion. Im not going to add a . DOHC and a shaker to my New Edge GT and call it a Mach  because my VIN still says its a Silver GT. Now its a GT with a Mach motor and intake. But what does it really matter? If you want to mod an old GT to totally match its Cobra counterpart whos going to stop you? I think given the year of the car in question youd be better off finding that year model Cobra and just buying one. For what youre gonna spend in parts and labor to transform a GT into a Fauxbra you could probably buy the real deal. ,MustangTech,cpm2yv8,22,t5_2x91t
3487596,0,t1_cpprpwd,When the clutch went out I had to drive it to the shop less than a mile away it whirred  hell I paid  for them to do the work I sorta hope the transmission goes out and make them replace it.

4385999,0,t3_3a4btr,Is that an OEM set from a junkyard etc or a plug and play system?Doesnt look like one of those fly by night brands and it looks proprietary so Im gonna go with OEM. Its not gonna work if so.Id like to see the    terminals you say you can use but youd run the risk of possibly ruining your electrical system.. theres no telling how that OEM ballast will draw amperage...,MustangTech,csk1ef8,1,t5_2x91t

4940325,0,t1_cuh8gnv,Ok thanks Ill try that in the morning.  One thing I forgot to mention is that a lot of the time I can smell fuel while driving with the windows down.  Does that rule out the IAC?,MustangTech,cuh9muy,1,t5_2x91t

5749926,0,t1_cx9mqxh,I am losing coolant every so often same with oil. The loss of power Im not sure of I dont really get on it the motor has k on it and I know previously it was dogged.

6760929,0,t1_d0idnxq,gtP this is nothing bascially means codes cleared not resolvedgt P   Sensor Heater Circuit Malfunction Bank  Sensor The Powertrain Computer or PCM has determined that the Oxygen Sensor has taken too long to begin switching after the Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor has reached its proper operating range preventing closed loop fuel control.This tells me your Bank  o sensor on the front in front of the cat isnt operating like it should. I would replace this O sensor. gt P Lack of Upstream Heated Oxygen Sensor Switch Sensor Indicates Lean Bank Bank one is lean. Basically your bank  front o sensor is not flipping rich to lean and back as often as it should.  This could again be a bad  sensor but its the other bank in front of the cat.  Now you always want to tackle these in the order they show. So if that p was first Id takle that reset your ECM and go from there. I suspect there is a possibility that your p could toss the p so theres that.If this were my mustang and I were absolutely certain there were no air intake leaks and I were trying to tackle it I would probably switch my o sensors around to see if the code will follow it. But I have to say that a p is very indicative to an intake manifold gasket leak.  Some other things you should check  Make sure your EGR is functioningisnt stuck make sure you have the correct thermostat and that its operational etc. One thing that could cause O issues on both banks is a bad ECM flash as well. You can also check  with a voltmeter. Connect the voltmeter to the signal wire from the oxygen sensor warm the engine and disconnecting the brake booster hose this will force a lean condition. Oxygen sensor voltage should drop to near zero. Then reconnect the hose and spray a shot of carb cleaner into the engine air intake sensor voltage should spike to near  of a volt because rich condition. If neither of those things happen on the voltage your sensor needs replaced. Same with the thermostat. Which reminds me could you just be low on coolant? Since your front o sensors report to your ECM and help control your engines airfuel a failingfailed one can easily mess with your idle and response. gt I can also feel very small surges of power while keeping a steady pressure of gas in any of the gears. If you move your os around and find that the p stays Id start really really looking at the gasket between the intake and the heads on your bank .  Because of the above quote thats why I think that. ,MustangTech,d0imxn8,1,t5_2x91t

7253650,0,t1_d22okrf,The parts cost for maintenance will also go up. And with it all said and done you will have put more money into the car than it is worth. If youre that worried about  rpm then trade the car for something else or just drive slower. ,MustangTech,d22os6r,3,t5_2x91t
7384421,0,t1_d2hin75,Youre welcome. Depending on your budget you may even be able to find a cheaper  . for as low as k in some places.  I personally choose a  v premium with manual trans over a  . with super high mileage. I got mine with .k miles on it and it is a certified preowned so it has an extra warranty up to k for power train.,MustangTech,d2hk46c,1,t5_2x91t
8252353,0,t1_d58phn1,I believe it is  throw reduction but I dont remember exactly. I can confirm that the reduction feels right though. I dont ever end up feeling like its too long.If I had to pick a down side to this shifternot that I actually dislike anything about it it would probably be that it gets a little warm if you dont put all the included insulation on it I didnt follow instructions  it gets a little warm sitting parked in Texas heat but cools down quickly when driving. It does vibrate a little more than stock because of how it is mounted but its not excessive and I actually prefer it. It makes the car feel a little more alive. The build quality is out of this world I wouldnt dream of putting any other shifter on an mt. I actually just got done installing one in a  gt and Ill be reinstalling the mgw in my new  years LE in the next couple weeks.,MustangTech,d593lsm,1,t5_2x91t
