536183,0,t3_209zev,I do Neuroscience amp Cognitive Science here at the UA.  Im not premed because honestly I do not want to be a doctor.  But I am planning on a Ph.D so its just as important for me to do well in my classes.  You say youre not very social but in my experience the best way to do well in class is to meet people who feel as strongly about doing well as you do.  These people will serve as a foundation for helping you learn how to study properly for your classes as well as being a resource for you to go to if youre having trouble. NSCS is a small major comparatively we have a Facebook group for the people in our graduating class because we all need the same courses and we all want to do well in them.I personally have not taken a class here before this semester Im a junior which makes this my... th semester here that required more than about  hours per week outside of class.  I am currently in about  classes that require much more than that and I have simply had to step up my game.  I get home and eat dinner then break out the notesbookspowerpoint slides and power through until Im comfortable with the material.  I do not eat while I study!  Its super important to have time away from school or youll drive yourself crazy.On Saturday night I have a game night with my friends which serves as a winddown for the week and some time away from my schoolwork.  I also have a job on campus that I spend  hours per week at.  Im in  units of coursework.Unfortunately you will not avoid the annoying kids.  I promise.  Your physics chemistry organic chemistry etc classes will have several hundred people in them.  There are going to be people that just dont understand and will spend hours arguing with your professors about why they arent doing better in the class.  The best way Ive found to avoid this kind of thing is to schedule a meeting with my TAprofessor outside their normal office hours.The best way to do well is to really want to do well.  Otherwise you will not be able to motivate yourself to put in the time it requires to make the grades you want and get where you want to go.Also for medical school look into volunteering at one of the local hospitals UMC TMC and get involved with some extra curricular activities.  Medical school is insanely competitive now and you likely wont be able to get in on just good grades alone.  The majority of people in my major are premed and I dont think any of them are lacking extra curriculars of some sort.  A lot of us got involved in research as soon as possible so you may consider that route as well.Good luck it looks like youre really ambitious and I hope your schooling is everything you want it to be.,UofArizona,cg17yke,1,t5_2s58b

3028916,0,t3_2uu4h3,I moved to UA from Texas not knowing a single person here in Tucson. I had a randomly assigned roommate lived in the dorms and made lots of friends from my residence hall.I doubt youll want to do that as a junior but dont fret! The students in Eller the business school form a pretty closeknit community and I can basically guarantee that youll find a crew that you like hanging out with. You could start out living alone and if you find someone youd tolerate move in with them?As for apartments manyif not most students live in the area north of the university between Speedway and Grant. There are plenty of rental homes and apartment buildings some are shittier that others. I would suggest looking in the area northwest of campus off of Park perhaps because thatll be closest to the business college. I had some friends who lived in Casa Espaa and it wasnt terrible. You can bike to class basically year round fuck yeah Tucson!. Or if you prefer to drive check out the Park Ave or Highland garages  a year daily rates available also or a Zone  surface lot pass  a year. These are all literally across the street from Eller. There is also a free shuttle service offered by the UA called the CatTran. You can look up their routes and schedules. Many of the apartment complexes offer shuttles as well. ,UofArizona,coby0tr,1,t5_2s58b
3644720,0,t3_321gwi,I found a lot of times its merely a matter of saying fuck it and diving right in. I went from HS to a different university before I came here and didnt know anyone. Best thing I found was to just get out there and hang out with my roommates at the time. But then I came here and was alone again and found that by joining a few clubs and just diving right in helps to make friends and keep your mind off of being homesick. Which will happen I might add. When the homesickness hits for the first time get ready because it might knock you on your ass but after that youll be good. To recap Dont let your fearsnerves hold you back. Homesickness is natural its part of living alone for the first time. ,UofArizona,cq7q3ow,2,t5_2s58b

5574654,0,t1_cwnzkv3,Normally Id say you can learn trig as you go. Thats essentially what I did I learned some basic trig for a couple weeks in high school but thats it. Trig and the rest of precalc is very boring on its own but in calculus theres actually some motivation to learn it.But I agree with this if youre not good at math jumping into calculus is a bad idea. I cant tell you how many times Ive TAed a calculus class and couldnt get my students to tell me anything more difficult than what sin or cos is.,UofArizona,cwo35r1,1,t5_2s58b

The only thing is that some are only offered in either the fall or the spring so you might get behind a year depending on your major and which semester youre in. ,UofArizona,dcdtl5v,1,t5_2s58b
