2497391,0,t1_cmkiczk,Absolutely. In my opinion BOB is one of the greatest miniseries ever. Watched it tons of times and every time it almost feels like new in a way. Also just finished the book for a second time fantastic read.  Now Im onto Richard Winters war memoirs definitely on a BOB kick and loving every minute of it. I seriously recommend the books they are great. ,BandofBrothers,cmkjpo0,7,t5_2skk5

The two of those pieces shifting around could create some rattling.,BandofBrothers,dgwmy3d,3,t5_2skk5
