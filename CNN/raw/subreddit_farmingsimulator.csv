I enjoy the rags to riches playthrough as well.To expand on save file  editiong you start a new game sell off any equipment you feel like then save. Open the save file MyGamesFarmingSimulatorsavefile and edit the economy and careersavegame .xml with notepad or what ever you use. careersavegame has an entry called money and set that to  or whatever you want to start with dont forget about the loan you start with. economy has a list of fields by number and you owning them is either true or false. set the any of the  starter fields to false and you can buy them back at your leisure.

9740329,0,t1_d95hugn,Yeah more complicated but still nonsensical. Spraying manure slurry fertiliser and weeding is all the exact same thing. And theres no need to do ANY of them except weeding which requires no costly additives. It would have been nice if you had to weed after sowing fertilise before cultivating and slurry or manure before plowing and spray before harvesting or in the case of insect infestation. It would be SO easy to have made it an ACTUAL farming simulator but for some reason GIANTS have never ever ever even tried to make a high quality game it feels like its a cruddy mobile phone game tbh. Its disappointing given how much money Ive dumped into this franchise that every expansion is just the bloody same as the next.

9805505,0,t3_5fnf1d,Id say grass management is a major player in meeting various goals regarding animal husbandry but is a secondary requirement because not all farmersranchers are going to have a sufficient land area of grass at all times to manage. Nature is annoying. lucrative might not be the best term but sustainable income since grass is hardier than grains. Farmland is dedicated to various purposes by regional climate infrastructure and soil types so it varies. It can be the primary focus depending on where you live and whether or not there is infrastructure to support the consumption. Bad Example if you grow cotton youd need a gin within a reasonable service area otherwise youll just get stuck with a bunch of modules in fields or have to ship them in some fashion which is an added cost. Note that modules are the old style of product for raw cotton collection and are bulky and difficult to transport and that now there are cotton bales which are easier to move around.edit to account for new cotton bales nearly forgot about those godsends So for silage youd want to be surrounded by dairy farms and live somewhere with a long growing season and good soil for corn or whatever crop you choose to ferment. IE Midwest,farmingsimulator,dalqmdj,3,t5_2vej0
9819416,0,t1_dangu6w,Yeah I think it would be better if you had to empty it to change the contents. P I was wondering the other day that you could actually pick straw to almost full and then just little bit of grass to change bale type to grass then wrap it to silage and make double profit. Also I have experienced grass bales coming out as hay bales randomly one or two times.,farmingsimulator,danhlcz,1,t5_2vej0
9832016,0,t3_5g3edc,If youre on PC then have a look at the link below. I found a way to mod the size of the vanilla PotatoBeet pallets to make that method of storage more feasible.

That took  trips back to the field to refill seeds.Then I rented the cheapest loading wagon for  and sold the straw from field  for . That took  hours at x.

10387920,0,t1_dcl8z1w,I did as well just not worth the bother for the style of farm Ive setup.  I pretty much just raise animals now and plant cropsgrass based on feeding them.  I did have  greenhouses lined up on the edge of a field by the cows on Goldcrest.  I used the water tanker and added a few fire hydrants mod so that I could refill as I drove down the line and not have to drive back and forth to a water supply.  The manure loading was still inconvenient though.TIP  Install a fire hydrant next to the water trough area at the animal pens and stick a water tanker within the refill area.  You can dispense water and refill the tank at the same time no driving around ,farmingsimulator,dcljajk,1,t5_2vej0

Some mods can not be ported to console and theres nothing GIANTS can do about it. Microsoft and Sony both said that no scripts can be used in mods on their consoles. So if mods like Auto Loading trailers Follow Me CoursePlay or a variety of others interest you PC is the only choice.editAlso PC doesnt have slot limits like consoles do.
