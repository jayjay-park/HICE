6251946,0,t1_cz09huo,On a slightly different note what do you think about adding a hold to look around key for the seamoth? Basically you can look around when piloting the cyclops but trying to see peripherally in the seamoth you have to reposition the entire sub. It just seems odd when the entire front has so much glass that it feels like an artificial restriction imo. Id just like to be able to look out through the sides of the existing viewable glass before exiting the sub or while piloting without it turning sideways.Id also like to see some sort of way to better track position when piloting the cyclops. Its too easy to slam outcroppings you can no longer see since its so long. Maybe some kind of virtual on board camera function? Like some cars these days have bumper camera you can see when backing up. Something similar you could maybe have as an optional hud displayed on the glass of the cyclops when steering it showing a few outside camera angles.But I think any cool functionality that can be added will be great. The first time I built one and explored the cyclops was amazing. It really is awesome. One of the most memorable vehicles in any game Ive played so kudos on the design. ,subnautica,cz0a1u8,5,t5_2yk91

6337424,0,t1_cz9rarq,I dont know much about the code of Subnautica but I could imagine that a cargobay is easier in regards to coding than a launcher might be. Maybe the lower rear could start out as a cargobay with a terminal to access it from the inside and some accesspoints on each side of the outer hull. It would be way more convenient to unload supplies from the Cyclops into a base if you dont need to get into the ship every time. Likewise gathering resources would be easier if you could just drop your loot into the cargo from the outside of the Cyclops. Additionally I could imagine this would work as a solid groundwork An inventory in the back of the ship and some hatches on the outside. Later once things like a beaconlauncher or dronebay are ready to be implemented youd already have the hatches for them to come out. For each dronebaybeaconlauncher the player installs the Cyclops loses an accesspoint for the cargobay until you have just a dronehub. ,subnautica,cz9ztsp,1,t5_2yk91

They can do that themselves.  They want opinions information and impressions.  They want backstory.  Not just someone saying What is this? over and over.Third unless your primary and only viewer base is going to be  year old boys you need to cut down on the swearing.

It could be a drone so you cant get in it or maybe it could only be auto piloted as well. It could have sensors that integrate with the new room and maybe it could land on moonpools and pick up SeamothsExosuits and deliver them to you.

7403801,0,t1_d2jh4bz,I think boredatworkbasically sums it up very well actually.I and I suspect the majority of followers of this reddit have no problem with Subnautica gameplay videos. What we do have is total saturation of day fumbling bumbling starving dehydrating and piecing together a seaglide while being killed by a variety of wildlife.If youre going to go this route you need to have absolutely grade A top of the class banter skills. You need to be able to entertain amuse and chunter on without a moment of dead air because the gameplay youre broadcasting is generic and old to us. You have to sell the video on your voice acting because none of the actions you are taking are of relevance. Editing can help snipping out irrelevant and long journeys and nipping away second pauses where nothing happens can make for more fluid videos that are easier to watch.What doesnt show up often when I search for subnautica is anything more interesting tutorials guides and wellplanned missions that help everyone get to grips with the game better. Things that might be interesting could include... Advanced abovewater construction. How do you make a floor tower on an island? Good caveexploration practises. Using dive reels dropping a beacon at important spots following a rds rule obtaining useful materials without getting lost or drowning. Finding and touring the abandoned sea bases. Checking out wrecks with sealed rooms and whats inside them. Farming teeth. Powering deep bases where solar isnt an option. Tooling up to move into reaper territory without getting eaten. Going deep without depth upgrades  how far can you push it with a Seaglide while bringing something useful back?...all of this while showing competence with basic mechanics. Make sure to do things like always carry salted fish water a welder and a spare power cell in your Seamoth and conspicuously use them to extend your expedition time. Pay attention to the environment avoid getting bitten and howling into the mic like its a surprise. Dodge stalkers. Avoid the clearly overpowered items like Seamoth solar panels because they make the game dull. Show the problems and show good solutions. And learn to edit before uploading your next video. Take hours over it work on it until youre happy to watch it back yourself. Good videos take time and love.My p is that to grow as a tuber this is where you need to start not where you move into once youre better at making videos.  People do not search youtube for lets play they search for a solution to a problem. Find a niche that nobody has done or at least not done very well and focus on that. Try to anticipate questions that arise in other peoples games and explicitly answer them. Starting yet another lets play is like opening a book shop between two already established book shops and then using their stock as inspiration for what you should have on your shelves and how much to charge for it.Offer unique content and your reception will be a lot warmer ,subnautica,d2jrhzb,3,t5_2yk91

I think there was a group who survived on the floating island. It was mercenary a scientist and his son who had some sort of advanced botany training. The merc bugged out living on the island after  a while wanting to build a underwater base. They moved to a base in the Jelly Mushroom zone with the botany kid which was successfully separated away from his father. It appeared to have been destroyed  by an animal probably a crabsquid.

8221190,0,t1_d5569r8,Why does it take ten seconds to craft bottled water from a fish but takes  minutes to desalinate water?  Im trying not to make excuses for inexplicable gaps in the tech tree but if I had to offer a plausible suggestion it would be that the blueprints in your PDA simply do not have the necessary information to craft the requisite technology.   Kinda like how your lifepod has perpetually charging power cells. You cant remove them because theyre part of a closed system and you cant reproduce them because your PDA doesnt know the recipe. The Aurora probably had some amazing tech on board like fusion generators but youre building makeshift equipment from piecedtogether schematics and sea garbage.  As for the power cell exploit I always just assumed the Power Cell Charging Station was drawing its own energy from the physical action of the engines like an alternator. But just like a tanker truck hauling a load of gasoline can still run out of fuel the Cyclops engines you currently have arent designed to transfer that energy directly so youre stuck running back and forth with a dixie cup getting gas out of the tanker and pouring it in the rigs gas tank so to speak.,subnautica,d557e70,10,t5_2yk91

8609142,0,t3_4xqqwg,umorighant is pretty much right but since you dont seem to know about blueprints Ill start from the beginning. Craft a scanner. This allows you to collect blueprint fragments which can be obtained by scanning those little rectangular silver boxes you occasionally see as well as pieces of some wrecked ships.. Search for a biome with red grass and armorplated shark things everywhere. This is where you can find pieces of destroyed Seamoths to scan for the blueprint.. Find a kelp forest and look around for large crashed ships. These are different from Seamoth pieces as they are mostly intact and cant be scanned. These ships will have the scannable silver boxes around them which have a chance to be vehicle bay fragments.. Once you have both blueprints build and deploy the vehicle bay and you can use it to construct a Seamoth! As long as it isnt out of power it has its own oxygen supply so you can easily go down to the jelly cave.,subnautica,d6hqloz,3,t5_2yk91

10220957,0,t3_5mcmhu,Pasting the developer reply from that thread LumpN  developer Dec    am Originally posted by BoredJedigtI painstakingly went through each files in the CellCache and CompiledOctreesCache by deleting running the game and restoring the deleted files. Seems there is just one file thats in the center of this lag and crash issue. If you dont want to reset the terrain and resources just delete this file....gtbakedbatchcells.bin In the CellsCache. In the SavedGames directory.Thanks for the tip well investigate. By the way even though we hardly ever reply we do read the forums all the time and hints like this one are very helpful to us. Please keep in mind that it might take a very long time to find and fix the underlying issue though.In the meantime I can provide a little background information about these files. The CellsCache folder contains data about all the entities plants creatures loot etc. in batches the player has seen. If a player never visits batch  then there wont be a file about it in that saved game. The CompiledOctreesCache contains terrain data only. Terrain data almost never causes issues unless one of the files gets corrupted while writing which may result in missing terrain.If a saved game runs slow at certain coordinates while a new game runs fine at the same coordinates then there is a fair chance that there is an issue with the CellsCache. The other potential culprits being the batch global or scene objects. You dont want to mess with the latter two though because they contain all your built subs bases and items.By the way the warp command to go to that batch is batch   . Batch numbers are always positive. The dashes are added to the filename for readability only.So as I said thanks well add this to our long list of issues to investigate which you can find on our Trello board. ,subnautica,dc2lpiu,26,t5_2yk91

So push for vehicle construction bay build your cyclops and live out of that no moonpool required build the modification station to get the necessary cyclops and seamoth updates and motor. Get the plasteel tanks and ultraglide fins to make fighting the reaper leviathan easier and stock up on health kits to prevent going below  health.... or dying at all for that matter. That takes care of Normal and Hard.Ultimate... this might not be as hard as all that.  hours of play time is a LOT of play time. Speedrunning all the appropriate blueprints might take  hours if you already know where the wrecks are rushing to cyclops might take another  hours to get the materials and blueprints another hour or so for the upgrades and visiting all the biomes might take another  hours. Killing the reaper might take  minutes. Potentially tough if your luck stinks but having a plan of action ahead of time can totally make that  hour deadline doable.

10967672,0,t3_5wmexc,Ok so just by chance this is exactly where I happened to put my base! Hopefully I can help with this. So if you come out from your life pod and look roughly due south towards the floating islands swim past the volcanic vent for about m The water will start to turn kind of a murky green then slightly to your right you will see a flat outcropping on a rocky cliffface. Its quite close so you should be swimming for no more than  seconds or so. But I can say it has been an excellent spot for a base! You are quite correct that you have a Kelp forest grassy plateau and the entrance to the grand reef all right next to this location. Ive built my base up quite a bit and have never once had an issue being attacked by anything. Having the base right on the edge of deeper waters is great for deploying the cyclops as well.

The benefits of the Prawn werent obvious to me ingame but they were in the Wiki.gtB Didnt realize you could build a Seamoth with the Mobile Vehicle BayI thought it was kinda dumb that only the Mobile Vehicle Bay could build vehicles on the surface of the ocean.  Can you deploy a Mobile Vehicle Bay in a Moon Pool?gtall the stuff you need silver for could be easily and realistically replaced with copper or gold.That is ridiculous at face value but I guess thats not how things work on the alien world?gtI feel like the ocean in Subnautica isnt even as dangerous as the Great Barrier Reef in the real world.Yes you have some great ideas as to how it could be more dangerous.gtI really want a spear and maybe a spear gun.I think a spear would be great  Im kinda tired of the standard knife but I would want there to be a weakness to the spear  Perhaps less damage?  Something to offset the increased rangedistance a spear would give vs the target.  I do respect the devs decision to make this game different with no guns though to try to foster more creative solutions.,subnautica,dg44ip6,1,t5_2yk91

11572709,0,t1_dg77jha,Im still playing from a save from  and still have no problem finding resources maybe one patch or two has changed things and caused a few more nodes to resetappear but for the most part Im still running just fine I have all vehicles upgrades and more than one large seabase my main one having about  main rooms  moon pools and a load more stuff and still getting more resources.,subnautica,dg7rtpo,1,t5_2yk91
11579963,0,t1_dg8kq1d,AFAIK they cover the whole biome with the caves in some of the islands likely being the only exception. Theyre more concentrated near the bottom I believe. Theyre a bit of a nuisance but can be distracted by light sources like flares or the external floodlights on the cyclops.  At least they dont steal cameras.. You can find their eggs here I have a few in my alien containment aquarium. They do attack each other sometimes so I wonder if you could just breed your own boneshark navy to kill the native population PWould definitely be cool to have a sprawling base covering several of the islands. ,subnautica,dg8lfy9,3,t5_2yk91
11580027,0,t1_dg7ka9s,Its pretty easy to build a simple base with lockers in it.  I never use the waterproof ones.,subnautica,dg8lpd4,1,t5_2yk91

11610776,0,t3_65pdbi,All  vehicles already have a crush depth where they will eventually be destroyed.Additionally the deeper you go the quicker you use Oxygen but there are no plans to make below certain depths be impossible because it would basically limit the ability to play the game.If there was a player crush depth then all the fun content would just have to stop at that level and there would be very little you could do within the vehicles below that if you couldnt leave your vehicles.,subnautica,dgc3b4v,28,t5_2yk91

11643008,0,t1_dgfqmni,Dont really need to check anything the game hugs and dips to like one frame a second all the time if youre moving quickly through zones.Not too mention the insane pop in of both landscape and creatures. Ive had reapers pop in like ten feet ahead of me when Im cruising in a sea moth.,subnautica,dgfqykz,4,t5_2yk91

11728639,0,t1_dgpgm1b,Luckily Im a licensed diver so I can respond at least.  Without the fins it is not too bad. If I was this guy first thing Id do in a smoke and fire situation would get my BC Tank and Mask.  As The PC can jump off a cliff and land in full scuba gear I cant imagine that it would take too long to suit up... but I get it from a design perspective.  Thanks for answering ,subnautica,dgpgzu9,11,t5_2yk91

11780026,0,t3_6831k2,previous updates have changed the locations of the databoxes or at least changed what you found in them ex. LifePod .  Probably just the devs stirring the gameplay mix. ,subnautica,dgvaxva,1,t5_2yk91
11780647,0,t1_dgv8z8i,Its definitely the larva that are draining the sub. You must be vigilant with them. A quick check might not get all of them and if it does theres a good chance more will latch on before you even get back to check your power. Theyre annoying little buggers. Theyre the reason I ran so many ion power cells in my sub could drive it around and not even worry bout the power drain.,subnautica,dgvdh8s,5,t5_2yk91
11794542,0,t3_689imx,Imo the depth active shield and power efficiency modules are all super important. The last is preference. My fourth is probably going to be extra decoy slots for if I come across any leviathans.,subnautica,dgwy96z,7,t5_2yk91
11799514,0,t1_dgxarkl,Looks really nice I like it. Ive been holding off playing until they optimize it my computer sounds like a jet engine when I play right now.,subnautica,dgxiklv,3,t5_2yk91
