2818620,0,t1_cnogt99,So if someone posts in a rgaming they should also get a red flag... Right? Its money that could go to essentials first? And rmakeupaddiction too. Posting in a sub isnt a red flag.I could also argue that the opiates sub is silly too because even if someone is addicted to a shitty life ruining drug that doesnt mean they dont need help does it?,Food_Pantry,cnogxti,7,t5_2shg9
