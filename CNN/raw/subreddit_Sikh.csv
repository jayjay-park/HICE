108749,0,t1_ceqpuu4,PLEASE dont feel insulted its clear that you really look up to Bhindranwale and I do too.Buuuuut Im always skeptical of looking up to figures wholeheartedly and ignoring certain aspects of their life.For one I dont know if he was educated by Gurbachan Singh in those topics. He had a religious education and could recite Bani well but Im not sure he had an education the way we think of.My family actually met him on several accounts saw his speeches and my father took Amrit from him. He wasnt a warm fuzzy fatherly figure he was the kind of person you were kind of fearful of but also like whoa hes a boss. And thats the kind of person you needed. But I do think one of his flaws was that he was a kind of rough and tough guy. He did get angry you can see it at the speech. Everyone else is talking in English and hes like STOP TALKING let me speak. He did get angry at his speeches if someone said something. Even his teacher said that he would get super angry if someone said something against religion. I understand that we needed someone like him for the govt to take us seriously but I think based on his life he struggled the most with krodh as his vice. Of course he struggled with it MUCH less than the everyday person did and he barely had any problems with the other vices.I dont think that we have to make him a perfect person to honor him. He even said Im not a saint who told you that. If we keep on saying oh but he was so awesome that he did this and he never did any wrong were almost making him to be a GuruGod something that would have pissed him off as well.,Sikh,ceqtac5,0,t5_2rfo4

1459341,0,t1_ciz2jbu,gtI would be slow to dismiss information published by a respectable organisation and placed prominently outside the prominent Gurudwaras presumably with the clergys blessingsAnother of this clergys blessings has been to ban women from doing kirtan from Harimandir Sahib. We dont even have a clergy in Sikhi but whatever the SGPC has done is not sacred. And the SGPC relies on a lot of hagiography as well.As per Kaur no it was not in use. It is a Punjabi derivation of the term Kumar or Kuvar. Singh was used by Rajputs and still is but Kaur was original you wont find Rajput women with Kaur. gtDifferent scholars have different opinions about the various dates in the Gurus lives. However we have taken these dates from the research conducted by the historian Bhai Kahan Singh Ji NabhaNabha was excellent but hes one scholars opinion. If I remember correctly he was a scholar during Singh Sabha movement which is always somewhat shaky with all the historic revisionism they did. Again all the old sources say that Guru Gobind Singh had one wife other than that contemporary to the Gurus time. However they also viewed Guru in a very regal way and many believed that Gurus burnt Mughals alive as well. It doesnt mean that it was the truth but it was culturally accepted. I would think the vaaran of Bhai Gurdas a contemporary are much more significant than the SGPCs interpretation influenced by postGuru Punjabi Sikh trends. ,Sikh,ciz7c7w,3,t5_2rfo4

Some are saying the disputed land was going to be used as another college for girls. So it seems the Sikh community is small but the Muslim community is significantly larger.Sikhs were definitely violent as you can tell from the video I posted earlier.

1794826,0,t1_ck5biw6,Theres no doubt these Muslim gangs are much much worse. Absolutely no doubt. They also however come from much more impoverished parts of Pakistan. Remember even the poorer Sikhs in Canada come from landowning families something the Muslims dont even have. I wouldnt be surprised if a lot of the Canadian Sikhs with problems were victims of police brutality and lost their primary breadwinner in the family. Im not even trying to say that those Canadian Sikhs because they dont represent the majority the silent majority is always not into these things and you have exemplary Sikhs like Jagmeet Singh are comparable but giving an example of how socioeconomic status can play a factor when its only religion. gtSo why do Muslims do it to Sikh females? I think its quite telling how the victim is almost never a Muslim girl.so what Im going to say is a bit uncomfortable but read to the end...Ive never quite realized how this is shocking. Most faiths with a strong community have this aspect. What Im doing to say is disgusting but fully honest if I see a girl in a dastar Im not going to check her out the same way I would a normal girl. Its not that theyre not attractive but its that I just cant do it the same way. Obviously Im not going to rape but if I was a hypersexual uneducated hick from an assbackwards family about to get married to my cousin you can see how the logic plays out in not choosing a Muslim victim. Even in my fathers time in the pind people would croon over Hindu women but not say a word about Sikh women. The fact that Islam is generally worse in this whole alienating the other community aspect than most other religions including Sikhi is perhaps the only religiousbased factor I can see in this and it plays a rather minor role. Another factor is that the Muslim women are going to be much. more restricted Im guessing Sikh women are more available and easier targets. I do believe some Hindu women were targeted too although I may not be sure.,Sikh,ck5dy0q,1,t5_2rfo4

2197320,0,t1_cliwdik,Good fucking God I was going to put some statement about the numbers being faked via government conspiracy as a sarcastic joke about how our Panth is in complete delusion but youve gone and done it for me. Tell me what corruption is there present in the Punjab government that wants to show less farmer suicides that is not present in the UP or Bihari governments? If you cant trust numbers on Wikipedia I.e. statistics based up in every single study on the topic why do you trust the statistics about the number of dead in s by organizations like ensaaf? After all there could be the possibility these were fudged numbers. Look at the research yourself every single independent agency has come to similar conclusions. Whether youre going to accept the numbers that are inconvenient to your narrative is up to you. Im sure if I posted some bogus stat with no support on this sub about how Ithe Indian Army killed  million Sikhs in  it would be fine bit since its showing other state have it worse than punjab youre going to question the methodology without going deeper into the surveygtI dont know whos taking advantage of who because every time I go to Punjab I see people of all castes suffering in poverty Jatts and Dalits alike. Thats a nice anecdote so heres one of mine Malwa regionthe Jatts live on their land dont do any Kheti and spend their time listening to Sharry Mann music on the way to either the movie theater or McDonalds. The Dalits condition has improved but theyre still the ones doing the work. I find myself chuckling at all these songs talking about the pride of Jatts when its the Dalits who are doing the most Kheti. Ive visited Majha and it is admittedly more squalor and poorer than Malwa. It is absolutely nothing compared to states like Bihar and UP or Maharashtra. Amritsar and Tarn Taaran were reliefs after visiting those shitholes. Im not saying you have to care for those states but have some perspective before you make Jatt poverty to be some endemic.Both were anecdotes. If you want actual statistics Punjabis are not suffering in poverty at all compared to other Indians. Other than the tech industries in South India theyre doing extremely well and are one of the richer states. But yes go ahead and label it a conspiracy from the center. gtYes caste discrimination is a serious issue as well but I dont think theres any conspiracy about the evil Jatts oppressing other castes while pretending to be victims. Besides I wouldnt call suicide prevention over caste discrimination a misplaced priority but at least we can agree that the Panth can do without either of the two issues.The conspiracy of evil Jatts oppressing other castes is not a conspiracy. You can see it with your own eyes. Post a video of Dalits telling stories of oppression in this sub. Post the video link to Marhi Da Deeva. Tell me the reaction you get. How would you react to the fact that one of Bhindranwales right hand men was part of Bidhi Chand Dalthe segment of Nihangs that has historically made Dalits drink from a separate bowl for Amrit chauthey paure wale. Some song is written about the glory of being Jatt and its coolafter all its just a lifestyle. Some guy writes a song about being a proud Chamar and hes mocked to no end as well as chastised for promoting caste. Whyd he write the song in the first place? Probably because someone said be proud of who you are just like us Jatts are proud of being farmers. Meanwhile show some Jatt losing some of his zameen or committing suicide and wow a huge response. How large of an issue precisely is imprisonment of Singhs? If india released thousands and said that was it would you believe them? This consistent fixation on  even when its not practical is the politics the Badals ride on and ultimately winds down to the fact that the a lot of those negatively affected at the times were Jatts who then push these campaigns. Theres nothing wrong with that and we should push for justice but its kind of ridiculous how that and the Sikhs need to be able to serve in American army are the only Sikh issues highlighted because ultimately they affect the friends and family of those who support these organizations I.e. Affluent Khatris and Jatts. And even then something like drug usage in Punjab is just thrown to the wayside or blamed on Pakistan because we have trouble believing men who have blue turbans and support our side of  could be that morally corrupt.EDIT and rereading your post Deaths wrongfully attributed to alcoholdrugs. Not to be rude but the delusion is out of the fucking ballpark right now. Is it really that hard to believe that Sikhs died as a result of their own stupid actions consuming drugs given by other Sikhs? So much that youre gonna support this idiotic theory evil BaniyaBhaman bankers from the central government stripping good Sikh Jatts of their life? We may as well say UFOs are the ones that are killing those apparently dead from drugsafter all youve admitted that the statistics and studies arent good for you so much as what you feel should be true and your own personal theories.,Sikh,clj4tm7,2,t5_2rfo4

After some digging I found this site The creation of the Granth began in Satyug at Nanded where Hazoor Sahib is located today. Oral tradition states that Sanyasi BrahmaAnand in Satyug lived at Nanded and compiled the Granth after the events which he saw during his Bhagti. As he was leaving his physical form his nine disciples asked him for mukti or liberation. BrahmaAnand told them that even though he was liberated he could not grant liberation only Guru Nanak Dev Ji could do that. Yet maharajs time was very distant. He would only be manifested in Kalyug. He told his nine disciples that when Guru Nanak Dev Ji came in his tenth form Guru Gobind Singh Ji only then would they receive liberation. When the disciples asked how they would identify Guru maharaj BrahmaAnand gave them his gutka and did ardass that when Guru Gobind Singh Ji came in Kalyug he should ask for the gutka until then all nine would not be affected death or any other worldly matter. Hence maharaj met the nine in Kalyug at Nanded received the gutka from them and granted them liberation.

3498142,0,t1_cpqzy21,I think Mahayana Buddhism is theologically very close to Sikhi. At the risk of butchering Buddist theology I think the key difference is the core outlook In Buddhism life is suffering and the idea is to detach sometimes physically from the surroundings to conquer the root of suffering. In Sikhi life is an optimistic gift and the idea is to recognize one of the roots of suffering attachment but also keep in mind that God permeates everything.Simply put by introducing the concept of panentheism into Buddhism God permeates everything  Ikonkar Buddhist theology could naturally evolve into Sikhi. We both identify similar goods and bads but because of this key difference our attitudes to them are different.While not directly about Buddhism this interpretation of the Sidh Gosht touches on some of these concepts and the Sikh perspective of them.

The SGGS speaks against blind rituals blind faith superstitions and you could SGGS agnostic towards beliefs such as the afterlife.The Gurus were not concerned with creating a religion with creation myths and great claims about a heaven with rivers of wine.The did not create elaborate arguments or stories to explain why humanity exists.They were simply concerned with lifting humans above the  thieves above maya and to realise that Waheguru is within all. They wanted us to feel that same connection with Waheguru to connect with Naam.There is a code in Sikhi certain things are not advised by SGGS such as alcohol or drugs.The Khalsa is a big part of Sikhi and they have to adhere to a code of conduct not cutting kesh.

You have also learned that these certain exercises helps your body feel relaxed and comfortable which helps relax and still your mind so that you can be fully focused on the Guru Mantra essentially supporting your Sikhi practice. Then you became the master of said exercise tradition in this case Kundalini Yoga you get to teach it and shape it however you want. You can essentially stay true to your Sikhi practice and way of life and most importantly you do not change Sikhi or teach Sikhi in any other way than what the Gurus taught.

4692900,0,t3_3f6ak1,This is called sheer stupidity. Amritdhari Sikhs are a group of individuals who have heeded the call of the th guru to be baptised and pledged thier life to the Khalsa. The Khalsa is a sort of higher body within Sikhism who helps maintain the identity of Sikhs as well as spread the message of Sikhi while commiting to a life of selfrefinement in order to be closer to God. Not every Sikh is Amritdhari and whether they should strive to be is a point of contention within some circles. However banning them from gurdwaras  the house of worship for Sikhs is unheard of and incredibly stupid in my opinion. There are Sikhs that masquerade as Amritdharis and try to impose strict rules within gurdwaras but those are problems with the individuals and should be dealt with on the individual basis.Gurdwaras are places of equality and worship this is why langar food halls as well as the general worship hall seat all individuals at the same level and only the Guru Granth Sahib is on a pedastal. Gurdwaras welcome people from all religions and walks of life to engage in its activites and require no commitment to the faith.

Being a Jatt hanging out with Jatts marrying a Jatt etc. is strongly ingrained over here. It is absolutely ridiculous cause it is extremely looked down upon if a girl or guy marry outside their caste.Concerning your third point I have not seen much interracial or interfaith marriage here. Probably only once has a girl or guy married outside the faith May be different in other places. One thing to point out when it comes to population is that Sikhism is fairly young and has already survived many genocides.

No need to answer dont think you will anyways but thats something a good body of Sikhs would vehemently say no to. gtMy last name is Singh. Stop assuming things.IMO there is nothing wrong with having Singh as your middle name and a caste name as your last name as long as you dont believe your caste is somehow better than another caste.Asking people to give up their family historyancestors name is pretty significant for a lot of people. It isnt even about caste it is about honoring your ancestors and knowing where you come from as last names can tell you about a persons village.My family last name is very uncommon and it is cool when I meet someone with that last name.Having your legal last name as Singh doesnt mean much when you literally state yourself that you are attached to it and feel that people shouldnt shed it completely. My legal last name is my caste name and even I have attachment to it the difference is that I dont pride myself on that or try to justify it within the Sikh framework and I hope one day I can shed it off proudly. gtNow please respond with more wild assumptions.Now please respond with more dodging around what you yourself have said semantic arguments and failing to analyze the big picture.

5027864,0,t1_cus1876,Oh I agree with you. Its similar to how Partition was colored by socioeconomic and political factors but religious violence itself cannot be discounted for. The specific incident on Hindus smoking cigarettes highlights this. The SAD petitioned for Amritsar to be given holy city status like Hindu holy cities like Benaras. This would mean no alcohol and drugs within the city. Hindus in the city paraded with signs saying we shall drink and smoke with leisure. I mean I can understand why they felt that but the unequal treatment of Sikh demands is what peeves me. Another example of a centralist government and media narrative that undermined Sikhs Shiv Sena threatens Sikhs by saying there are  Hindus for every Sikh in India so they better be careful. Bhindranwale responds with something along the lines of there are  sheep for every lion and the media takes this in isolation and spins it off as hes threatening genocide. A Hindu killed on a bus makes the national news but a Sikh killed by a cop is called a terrorist. Sikh groups pushing for regional autonomy promised at Partition via a legitimate democratic process are labelled as antinationalist terrorists. Even the disgusting affair at the Asia Games when all Sikhs even generals were searched and barred from attending.Regarding media narratives there was rabid anti Sikh sentiment across India. The RSS generally hated Indira but agreed with her on Bluestar and they did not contra to their modern narratives protect Sikhs from congress goons. Media outlets even tried blaming the Bhopal gas disaster on Sikh groups!It is really shameful that Khalistanis later went around killing Hindus. My dad knew one such person his whole family was like in Delhi and he wanted revenge. That was the problem with the movement towards the endpeople just wanted to punish the minority Hindus and do the exact same things we got upset at India for doing to us.

What they dont account for was the days monthsyears these brave men spent on the road finding places to stay and being away from their families. These guys along with their families were hunted. When my father was arrested on false charges his whole family had to leave their home as well and go into hiding. The best way to hurt a man is to hurt his family.

Theres no other explanation for how someone can go on to make stupid statements like Justin Trudeau coming under the influence of terroristextremist Sikhs. What nonsense.As an aside my local Gurdwara was controlled by a socalled moderate party for at least a decade probably more. They almost ran it into the ground. You could probably count the number of times they had Amrit Sanchars in all those years on your hands. No Gurbani Vichaar. No Parchar of Sikhi. Horrible financial management. Then a few years ago a new party gained control. Every member was an Amritdhari. Now we have regular Amrit Sanchars Gurbani Vichaar every week and Parchar to the youth. The financial situation also seems to be a lot better because the Gurdwara actually has the money to expand its building. Im not saying this to suggest Amritdharis are somehow magically naturally better leaders than nonAmritdharis Im not Amritdhari either. The takeaway point is that even this new party was being labelled as extremist by the old guys even for simple things like saying we should sit on the floor instead of on tables. In the eyes of the socalled moderates here you are an extremist even if you think we should eat Langar on the floor. I usually dont even bat an eye when I hear someone calling someone else an extremist sikh anymore because of how often it is used for the stupidest purposes. And I think thats exactly whats going on here again.,Sikh,cwp8vaz,7,t5_2rfo4

5715002,0,t1_cx4ps1b,I think youve brought up some really good points here and these are all things Ive dealt with myself in the past. I remember I even created a thread on something a bit similar in the past maybe there is something in there you will find useful As for this post Id like to go through it and offer some thoughtsask some questions.gt If God in Sikhi is described as a personal God who intervenes in matters it creates enormous contradictions. If God is described as you say as more of a root of existence it makes it so vague as to be essentially meaningless. Not to mention it does not define any other properties of God.Are these the only possibilities to choose between? Does it either have to be a personal God who intervenes or a vaguemeaningless root of existence? Is it not possible to have a Creator who doesnt suspend Its own laws to magically help a group of people over the others but is still Personal to each and every living Being? Is it not possible to have a Creator which permeates and sustains every aspect of our reality and remains directly and intimately accessible to all Creation?gt Thermodynamics could just as well be the root of existence yet we do not worship or try to be closer to thermodynamics because it is an emotionless law describing only the creation and maintenance of the universe nothing else.AFAIK thermodynamics and other such physical forces we observe in our universe could not possibly be the root of existence simply because the originate at the big bang. They are not Aad Sach Jugaad Sach Hai Bhi Sach Nanak Hosi Bhi Sach as Gurbani tells us. For reference physics of the universe tells usgt Therefore to those who claim that the very idea of a Big Bang violates the First Law of Thermodynamics also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy that matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed proponents respond that the Big Bang does not address the creation of the universe only its evolution and that as the laws of science break down anyway as we approach the creation of the universe there is no reason to believe that the First Law of Thermodynamics would apply.None of these laws could possibly be the root of existence because they dont make sense the closer and closer we get to the big bang.gt The things you describe do not need God to happen. You can live virtuously detach yourself from falsehood detach yourself from your ego all without requiring anything supernatural.I think God is the wrong word here because whenever people think of God they automatically think of the supernatural as you have demonstrated in the comment. I am highly skeptical of whether this even applies to Sikhi. But moving on...gt You can live virtuouslyWho gets to decide what is virtuous or not? If everyone decides for themselves then it becomes redundant to say I am living virtuously because really I am just following my own subjective definition which could be radically different from the next person in line.gt detach yourself from falsehoodAgain who gets to decide what is falsehood and what is not? Do we do this for ourselves? Because once more it becomes redundant to say I am detaching myself from falsehood when really all I am doing is picking and choosing based on my own subjectivity what I avoid and what I do not avoid. My definition could be radically different from the next person in line.gt detach yourself from your egoThe problem is that the definition of ego varies greatly depending on where you search. The western definition of ego is not the same as in Buddhism which if I am correct isnt exactly the same as in Sikhi.So which ego am I to detach myself from? Why? What makes my definition of ego more correct than any other? If it is all subjective then it becomes redundant to say I am detaching myself from my ego because that statement means so many different things to so many different people. Really then all I am doing is acting on my own subjective understanding just like everyone else and the statement becomes meaningless.gt This is the thing that I began to struggle with recently. There is no definition of God that I can find that meets all four criteriagt is logicalIs human logic perfect? Is it even possible for humans to be completely logical?gt is possibleDo we have the ability to say for sure what is and isnt possible? If anything recent advancements in Quantum Mechanics have shown us how our entire understanding of reality may be completely flawed especially when we have come across so much which already seems like it is sciencefictiongt is meaningfulgt is worthy of worshipconnectionIsnt this purely subjective? Likewise how can imperfect human beings pass any concrete judgement over what is truly meaningful and ultimately worthy of admiration?gt To bring it home imagine there is another planet just like ours where somebody has made a fire. I can believe that fire exists and when I think about it I can feel the heat from the fire. Try it now you can actually fool your senses slightly. Just like if you think hard about a flavor say strawberries you can just barely detect that flavor in whatever you are currently eating. But even if I can experience this heat and even if I can conclude that this fire is somehow real... it does not affect my life. It only has the meaning that I give to it but the fire itself does not have the ability to travel throughout space and become warm on my body. I am the one creating that sensation. In this way experiencing a nebulous root of existence makes about as much sense as deciding that because I can trick my brain into experiencing the fire it is somehow a god.This is a very interesting paragraph. I wanna go through it bit by bitgt imagine there is another planet just like ours where somebody has made a fire. I can believe that fire exists and when I think about it I can feel the heat from the fire. Try it now you can actually fool your senses slightly. Just like if you think hard about a flavor say strawberries you can just barely detect that flavor in whatever you are currently eating.Did the Gurus Bhagats Bards and GurSikhs who lived among them claim to slightly feel Wahegurus presence among themselves? Were the  years from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh or the roughly  years from the earliest to the last writing in SGGS based on barely experiencing Waheguru in their lives? What does the writing actually say about this? What does Anand Sahib say? What does Sukhmani Sahib say? There is no better way for us to understand what the Gurus were talking about then to read the autobiography they left behind for us as they travelled on Sant Ka Marg.gt But even if I can experience this heat and even if I can conclude that this fire is somehow real... it does not affect my life. It only has the meaning that I give to it but the fire itself does not have the ability to travel throughout space and become warm on my body.Did meeting Guru Nanak have no effect on the life of Bhai Lehna? Did Meeting Guru Angad Dev have no effect on the life of Amar Das? Did meeting Guru Amar Das have no effect on the life of Bhai Jetha?Regarding fire travelling through space and becoming warm on your body which aspect of Sikhi is this being compared to?gt In this way experiencing a nebulous root of existence makes about as much sense as deciding that because I can trick my brain into experiencing the fire it is somehow a god.Again is root of existence really the best description of Waheguru? I was under the impression the entire SGGS is in a way an exegesis on Ik Onkar and our relationship with that Divinity... is that really nebulous?This was a great post to read and offer my thoughts on I really have to thank you for making it. My final point would be that we should all strive to keep an open mind and be open to the possibility that our current understanding is not complete and there are things out there we just cannot account for. For some people like Stephen Hawkings the very idea that human beings are capable of having knowledge about absolutely every aspect of our reality is a pipe dream itself.gt Some people will be very disappointed if there is not an ultimate theory that can be formulated as a finite number of principles. I used to belong to that camp but I have changed my mind. Im now glad that our search for understanding will never come to an end and that we will always have the challenge of new discovery. Without it we would stagnate. Godels theorem ensured there would always be a job for mathematicians. I think M theory will do the same for physicists. Im sure Dirac would have approved. ,Sikh,cx5i2n6,3,t5_2rfo4

6355865,0,t1_czc27jh,. Starting off there are no extant hukams from Guru Gobind Singh. The  hukams have no historical grounding from before the th century and furthermore if they were present we wouldnt have had a slew of rehitname coming from secondary sources like Nand Lal and such. To that extent while the Khalsa roared through and were the leaders of Sikhi there were many Sikhs that chose not to follow the Khalsa. Sahejdharis like Kaura Mal and I believe even prominent figures like Bhai Kannhaiya. Secondly I understand well enough the martial aspect of the Khalsa something thats too often missed when we say our karas represent the oneness of God or our hair are our spiritual antennae. Even in Guru Angad Dev Jis time the akhara was established. Sikhi is about procuring a healthy mind in a healthy body. However I dont agree that the martial aspect dominates the spiritual aspect or that theyre even on equal footingmaybe thats what a couple centuries of violent Jattdomination made it out to be but I think theres a lot of evidence from Sikhi itself that the inner battle is the most important one that must be fought. I also think the problem is that in the fascination for the pastthe recent history of the s the significance of what the Akali Dal what they originally were not the corrupt worms they are now is lost. Saka Nankana Sahib the Chhabi movementthese were all pretty significantly done and with political clout even if not in a gunsblazing swordflashing manner. Im all an advocate for people to get basic selfdefense training and horsemanship skills and regret the pussification of so many aspects of the Khalsa identity crying about our hair for example but I dont your military solutions do much for the Panth and its problems. . How so? He spent a very small proportion of his life in combat. Yes he trained militarily but he was part of the spiritual legacy of the  other nonmartial Gurus. Sipahi is not irrelevant I just think Punjabis tend to overemphasize it. The misldars battles are glorified but missed is the political inefficacy and internecine warfare that resulted from groups of people reaching for their kirpan before their mann. . How do you emphatically know that their vision was rule of the Panj Pyare? Where does Banda Singh Bahadurs leadership come into that equation? The dals? The misls? Ranjit Singhs Dal Khalsa army? Sad as it is I think its a tough and necessary pill to swallow that there is no divinelysanctioned leadership no caliphate to aspire for throughout the agesSikh political leadership is decided by the Khalsa Panth and has changed throughout history just like the masand system and nonmartial Panth that it replaced.,Sikh,czc3bnr,1,t5_2rfo4

7199911,0,t1_d1w6ir0,Just want to say that Bhatt Bani can be grossly misunderstood so be weary of how you read it and which translations you are reading.Im not speaking about the rest of bani however in Japji Sahib I dont think Guru Nanak Dev Ji actually refers to devte or seems them important at all.In the pauree you linked Guru Ji says Kete  countless there are countless brahmas fashioning things. Brahma is a synonym for creation.This pauree appears to be on kirpa of Waheguru all this creation happens according to kirpa.In the ika maee jugat viaaee pauree Guru Nanak Dev Ji says these  followers are under the control of Waheguru and do their job according to Hukam. He says one is sansaree creator one bundaree sustainer and the one laee deebanh the one who runs the court destruction and I see it as cause and affect.The first line can be interpreted in many ways. The ones I go for is that Guru Ji is stating the popular opinion of many people that there are  offspring that came about from a divine mother. The other way you can read this is that there is One Divine Mother which is the cause for the  fundamental processes of life and the Universe.The most interesting line is          They look but they cannot see this is so wondrous.I dont know if this makes sense but it appears to me that this is saying that the sargun world the physical world of creation preservation and destruction cannot see Waheguru. It appears be that there is part of Waheguru the Divine Mother part which is beyond its cheyleh and it is the nirgun aspect of Waheguru.That is why bani tells us to look within ourselves and try to find the Nirankar Waheguru there.Sachkhand vasai nirankar  in Sachkhand the nirankar the formless resides.This Nirgun Waheguru the Waheguru we ultimately wish to merge with is the one who resides formless.So the  cheyley are not important at all ultimately as they cannot see what Waheguru is and will not help you get to Waheguru.If they were important why are there countless of them just being made by Waheguru at will?SGGS sometimes does make it seem as if devte dont exist they are unimportant whereas sometimes it seems they do exist. This all points to the fact that metaphysical beliefs are not important.You have a Bhagat Namdev on one side and Sheikh Fareed on the other who often uses Abrahamic ideas point being these beliefs are unimportant.,Sikh,d1wklo0,2,t5_2rfo4

Most likely it is a very simple food to make hence it is always made.

Then it is given first to the panj pyare if present and then open distributed to the sangat. The ingredients are very simple and household and it became a tradition.

And I also do ardas before bedtime because everything is in Wahegurus hukam at the end of the day.My friend sent me some tips as well so I hope these can helpThe best way of waking up for amrit vela is to eat little at night and to go to sleep on time. Until the stars disappear it is the fourth quarter of the night amrit velawhich is considered the most conducive time to meditate and worship Vahiguru.The way in which our minds can be attached to simran and baaNee at amrit vela is not possible at any other time.Baba Nand Singh Jee used to say that when we do our Nitnem in the mornings Guru Nanak Dev ji is holding our armIn Rehraas Sahib it says Bhayee prapat manukh dehuriya.

The problem is that thats not what sgpc is. The problem is that this actually may disenfranchise sehajdhari Sikhs without actually benefiting Sikhi to a big degree. The problem is that sgpc isnt even an institution that is in accord with Gurmat.

7569617,0,t3_4izcrq,This is an unusual although not unheard of practice for a Sikh. Our founding Guru Guru Nanak taught us that the various Gods and Goddesses are themselves at the door of the One. There is nothing greater or equal to the One. That is why the Guru Granth Sahib our holy scripture starts with  One Divine Doer. From Japji Sahib arguable the most important prayer for Sikhs written by the Guru Nanak         The Guru is Shiva the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi Goddesses.          Even if I know I cannot say Speaking I cannot describe.     Guru give me this one understanding           There is only One Giver of all souls. May I never forget Him! ||||This is quite difficult to understand even for those who have been Sikhs all their life. But if you understand that the Ultimate Guru is Waheguru God. Then Guru Nanak is saying that all the various Gods and Goddesses are just a part of Guru One God. Then Guru Sahib asks God Guru to give us this one understanding that there is just One Giver of all souls. So if you are a Sikh and you have faith that there is One who is the master of all then why would you pray to an aspect or incarnation of the One? Why not pray to the direct source? Why then the need for a middleman excuse the insensitive bluntness  such as Ganesh?In conclusion worshipping Gods and Goddesses is not common practice among Sikhs and this is supported by our Scriptures.edit wording and formatting ,Sikh,d32mmyy,3,t5_2rfo4

9095107,0,t1_d851hct,Well the term useless can be applied to all rituals as they have no perceivable effect to observers. The point Guru Nanak makes is not that the ritual itself is useless but that the symbolism involved was unnecessary. He still partook in the ritual substituting the abstract symbolism with the Truth.Another example where this type of simplification is evident in Sikhi is when we perform matha at the Gurdwara. The gesture is clearly to bow and lower ones self before the GGS. But this gesture is also definetly not unique to Sikhi and in various Buddhists and Muslim sects full prostrations are the norm. Does this mean they get any closer to God than Sikhs only bowing from the knees? That would be picking nits because as long as the action is done with the same underlying intention and spirit what does it matter? Sikhs dont need to but can certainly choose to do the more involved full prostrations. Actually some Sikhs do just that and I myself have felt it appropriate at times.  ,Sikh,d8533wb,2,t5_2rfo4
9098474,0,t1_d857mqj,Yatra doesnt exactly mean pilgrimage it can also mean a procession much like a nagar kirtan and a journey.There is no spiritual justification in Sikhi for pilgrimages just like there isnt for rituals. A pilgrimage will not make your mind pure just like a ritual wont. But Sikhi does utilise rituals for many purposes as an aid for your spiritual practice. In the same way pilgrimages can be an aid for your spiritual practice.Going to the definition a darshan yatra is a journey to do darshan to see something. Often theyre taken with a group. In Punjab they would do a pind yatra or take family with them to a gurdwara.Often these pilgrimages can change people. I know people who have visited gurdwaras on yatras and come back changed people. Often the famous gurdwaras have a rich history associated with them and have a special vibe. There are many reasons why someone may undertake a yatra. Often it is an amazing experience to bond with your fellow sangat and to reflect on your life. Theres nothing wrong with taking a trip to see a historic gurdwara. This is the same as any other ritual Sikhi has.The position of Sikhi is that there wont be enlightenment just for visiting a certain place. Someone can keep wandering at all the worlds teeraths if they arent taking the time to reflect and go on a journey within theyre wasting their time.In Punjab it was a popular activity still is for people to do especially around Vaisakhi and historic days. The Gurus even created days in the year for Sikhs to meet on.Its better for a Sikh to visit the Guru and places of historical importance to Sikhi than to visit a dera or the place of some Hindu God.,Sikh,d85hmzz,3,t5_2rfo4

Obviously form a Sikh point of view the Gurus were the most perfect and divine beings however it is never explicitly stated that they were the only ones who possessed knowledge or divinity.   I agree that we do not truly know of Jesus words or actions but from what we do know we can conclude that they were in fact in line with Sikhi. The reason why Jesus was superseded was becuase he never complied and sealed his writings and teachings into a single text that was verified by him. I am not arguing whether or not the bible is legitimate I am merely stating how Sant Jesus Christ Ji possessed divine qualities and had attained a level of divinity but nothing compared to the Gurus. ,Sikh,d8k7iwr,1,t5_2rfo4

10101583,0,t3_5kfgmw,I personally dont care whether an afterlife exists or not I think if it does it is probably nothing like what most Sikhs envision but I do not think that the concept of any sort of afterlife is antithetical to Sikh philosophy.Im not sure I see how love and afterlife are mutually exclusive. It is very much possible for someone to believe that an afterlife exists while still being motivated out of love for Waheguru and if uDrunkenSikhs point about Sikhi being about egoloss and not primarily love is correct then it is further proof that an afterlife is not opposed to Gurmat. In any case even if it were false Id still argue some form of afterlife is perfectly compatible with Sikhi. We can a accept that Naam is the path to Waheguru and b accept that an afterlife exists without c being motivated  to engage with Naam to attain b. An analogy that seems appropriate to me is that of weight lifting. An individual can lift weights because they want to keep their muscles strong so that they can be used in old age. However a byproduct of weight lifting is that you become more attractive to the opposite sex. The individual in question may not be lifting weights for that reason but weight lifting makes you healthy and it just so happens to be that healthy people tend to be more attractive than unhealthy people. The added attractiveness is a sideeffect of the activity even though it may not be the primary reason for engaging in the practice. Similarly one can engage with Naam because they love Waheguru. But it can just so happen to be that those who engage with Naam reap some sort of benefit in the afterlife just as the weightlifter reaped an additional benefit of being more attractive to the opposite sex. A byproduct of engaging with Naam can be that after you die you receive some sort of reward even if that was never your reason for engaging with Naam in the first place. In that sense one may think of Naam as exercise for the soul the more you do it the healthier your soul becomes except that instead of becoming attractive to the opposite sex you receive the Darshan of Waheguru upon leaving this world.Those are just my thoughts on the topic again Im not particularly concerned with whether there is something after death or not. I have my own views on which is more likely but I certainly dont think the afterlife is logically exclusive from engaging with Naam out of pure love.Bhul Chuk Maaf Karna.,Sikh,dbo8zeu,6,t5_2rfo4

Shastar are weapons whether people feel we need them or not that is what they are. gtRecently there was a video circulating about an instance in Delhi. It was about a young Amritdhari Sikh who got invited to a wedding and he was the only Sikh there. The table he was sitting at with his friend got rowdy after drinking and started harassing him asking him why he was dressed in bana. He had a gun pointed to his head and was beat up by  fully grown men he somehow managed to call a Khalsa Singh he knew. And that Khalsa didnt call the police he grabbed his three and a half foot kirpan and managed to rescue the young Singh.

You cant bow down to God he isnt a physical being. The kingly riches were likely due to well youve been to the Gurdwara youve seen how much money is donated to help the building be maintained and for the Langar. The earlier gurus also needed money to live as they were pilgrims after all so relied on donations. Later on the Indian aristocracy donated to the Gurus. This was due to signs of respect  gifts  attempts to gain favours and many of them becoming Sikhs themselves. Dressing like a rich man was an intelligent political move. All great temples St Peters Bascillica Grand Mosque Harmandir Sahib  all look impressive to invoke power behind the religion. To dress the Gurus up in a similar fashion has the same effect. Furthermore Im not  sure they dressed like that. Many pictures we see may have just wanted to invoke kinglyness. Finally whats wrong with polygamy? It may seem weird in the west but in the east it was normal. As long as you show love and respect towards both wives and children. The Gurus also became political figures in India.

10437663,0,t3_5p2nkp,Jagraj Singh seems to have bought into the complete antiintellectual fantasy of colonialism being some giant monster that can describe everything bad about Sikhi today.Drug usage opium marijuana and alcohol sexual promiscuity harems the mixing of HinduSikhi in what we now refer to as Sanatan Sikhi the veneration of descendants of the living Gurus alongside Guru Granth Sahib the regressive practices of Sati and Purdah the practice of abject caste discrimination in the Harmandir Sahib sarovar and so on were all characteristic among Khalsa Sikhs in the precolonial period.Im not saying the British saved us from these things obviously they didnt but the British period afforded a new intellectual paradigm for Sikhs to revise some of these practices in what we today call Singh Sabha Lahir. Were the British ultimately selfinterested asshats? Like any colonizer yes. The gothic tower the initial control of Gurdwaras the manipulation of Sikh assets until the advent of the SGPC demilitarization and the dissolution of Shastar Vidya all of these things were awful and should be pointed out as such yes. But it wasnt anything to the level of paranoia Jugraj Singh is trying to make out. People claim the Lahori Singh Sabha was a British creation infiltrated by British agents not realizing the Amritsari Singh Sabha led by socalled traditionalists was headed by Sir Khem Singh Bedi knighted for his valiant work in the British military.Some of these points are an absolute joke. The turban style has been constantly evolving and the colonial period introduced a new evolution of it. Even the pagh style he has is nothing like the original pagh style and even farther removed from what the Gurus wore. Tying up of beards was for practical purposes in the military and was done precolonially as well in Rajput style such as Maharaja Sher Singh. His rant on Partition is even more confused. Not to mention the fact that without demographics significantly changing under the British period Sikh numbers climbed Hindu numbers fell the Sikhs had absolutely no presence to call for their own country. The claim was ridiculous any way you took it. Thats why the Sikhs petitioned for the division of Punjab and the border as such and in general why Sikhs had the strongest presence in the proceedings wRadcliffe they managed to wrestle parts of Gurdaspur tehsil that should have otherwise gone to Pakistan with threats of armed insurrection. Ironic that Jugraj Singh once used to harp on with nonsense pride about how we served in their wars but now has gone the completely other side. ,Sikh,dcr6k29,1,t5_2rfo4

You need to go back and reread what I wroteThe word Kirpan Gurmukhi   has two roots  the first root is Kirpa   which means Mercy grace compassion kindness and the second root is Aan   which in turn means Honor grace dignity. So together the word stands for the dignity and honor of compassion kindness and mercy. The Kirpan must only be used for self defence and to uphold justice. As long as a blade is used with these qualities it is a Kirpan. Nothing I said was unfactual. If a nonsikh possesses a blade and he himself is imbued with Kirpa Mercy grace compassion kindness and Aan Honor grace dignity and uses the blade for self defense and to uphold justice then by definition according to what the word kirpan actually means it is a Kirpan. gt  your are going to go give your head to the guru this vaisakhi. you have already predetermined and decided all definitions. to fit already within the context of the world you exist in.Why are you misrepresenting and lying about my views?

I learned a lot and have subsequently learned more because I came here after and I know a lot of others did as well.  I think that the AMA achieved its goal and a lot of people who otherwise would never have known much about you guys now do  and isnt that what we should all want?  To understand each other and where were coming from?Anyway Im not here to be contentious but Id like to address a few things from your OP and things Ive seen on this sub since the AMA when I began browsing it.gt I dont feel it was right for any single moderator to represent the views of Sikhs or rSikh or in fact engage in that sub. The ama was clear that they dont speak for all Sikhs so theres that.I dont think you even read the OP of the AMA.  They specifically addressed this preemptively by literally sayinggtgt As a disclaimer we would like to remind you guys that we do not purport to speak on behalf of all sikhs. Our community is a mix of many different political beliefs and leanings and the Sikhs who have come here today are those who are the most eager to engage with you guys. As such once more unless stated otherwise we are speaking solely for ourselves in political posts.Next there was a post earlier on this sub about TD using the AMA to show that they were not racists.  I have to say that I find this absurd for several reasons.  Firstly because I am black and I dont hide this and I have seen uncountable people who arent white on TD and I have never ever been mistreated.  In fact just about every demographic you can think of is represented in TD and I have not once  ever  seen a person mistreated for any reason other than their actions.  If someone has a bad or incorrect opinion Ive never seen TD attack the person for their skin color or sex or orientation Ive only ever seen them attack the badincorrect opinion or the persons actions.  Now of course TD has its bad apples and false flags but they are pretty quickly downvoted into oblivion andor removed and the overwhelming majority of people are just there to MAGA.The other things you wrote in your post seem like MSNBC talking points and if you really wanted to find out what TD is about you should go there.  Hell you should even post and ask questions or say your opinion and either have it be confirmed as correct or disputed.  There are very few places on reddit now where a person can post and be against the prevailing wisdom and still expect a respectful dialogue.  Myself and many others are coming here to learn about you shouldnt you want to do the same before you saygt I think Donald Trump is an embarrassment for white people for America and humanity in general. He is a disgusting human being that surrounds himself with other disgusting human beings and demeans the very nature of Americaleft or right.gt ...gt The altright chan supported nonsense in there with the view of burning down this country for the lulz is not something any Sikh should get behind or legitimize imho.By the way the above is pretty much mutually exclusive with gt but I definitely respect people on both sidesLastly Ill just tell you a little about me  Im a yearold registered Democrat.  I supported and voted for Obama twice and then supported and voted for Sanders in the  primaries.  One of the main catalysts for my voting for Trump is that I was disgusted by the DNC Clinton and the media and I voted out of protest.  Several months later Im on board the Trump train despite disagreeing with much of what he says and does.  More than anything else I care about free expression and the preservation of a Western system of values that cherishes free expression openness and freedom from oppression and this has caused me to find common cause with many other people even while disagreeing with them on other subjects.  I think there is a lot of common ground to be found between the Sikh community and people who voted forsupport Trump.  Trust me on this I dont agree with plenty of things that Trump says or does but if I can find common ground anyone can.As I mentioned above Im a black man.  Ive experienced racism in my life and it sucks.  But let me tell you that over the last few years as my views have been evolving I have experienced orders of magnitude more racism from other black people and people on the left than I ever have from people on the right or white people.  If I dont agree with the prevailing views Im an Uncle Tom or a house ngger.  They value diversity except for the most important diversity of all diversity of opinion.Im also an Army Iraq War veteran.  Ive been to countries in the Middle East and seen with my own eyes how Sharia law or just fundamentalist Wahabi Islam causes widespread violence and misery.  This isnt racism it is just an observation.  Islam like all religions is a set of ideas and I believe that all ideas must be open to interrogation scrutiny and even ridicule in a free open and just society.  Lastly I also happen to be an atheist.  I dont agree with any religious or superstitious belief and I know that I will never see eyetoeye with any religious person Sikhs included on the matter but that doesnt mean that I dont want to learn about where youre coming from.  And that doesnt mean that we cant find common ground to stand on and build from.  I can disagree with you about  things but as long as were willing to talk and discuss Im willing to have my mind changed as I hope you are too and even if were diametrically opposed on  fronts we can still cooperate if we can find a single thing we can agree on.I know TD can be quite hyperbolic at times so I take a lot of stuff with a grain of salt.  In between the Pepes and Deus Vult memes there is a sincere wish to want to know the truth even if it is an uncomfortable truth.  Other subreddits routinely censor content that goes against their narrative so in order to get a balanced view of things I have to go to TD.  gt What I am is a Sikh and an American.This is literally all I care about patriot.,Sikh,dfxe23k,6,t5_2rfo4

11500667,0,t1_dfzdf4a,The observation that humanity has always been like this would imply that Kaljug is a state of mind rather than a specific time period or perhaps that humanity has always lived in Kaljug. Its a different interpretation than the one suggested by OP. ,Sikh,dfzlmnh,1,t5_2rfo4

11528566,0,t1_dg2o29j,Although I dont feel like this topic itself needs too much discussion Id love to find more books like this that give a really comprehensive analysis of Sikh issues in English. Where do you recommend looking for pdfs like this?,Sikh,dg2rjpu,3,t5_2rfo4
11588654,0,t1_dg9g3e4,gtthey are from etymologists linguists and historians who know more than you and IThere is not a single thing in the nonsense you post that is corroborated by work from any serious academic literature. Remember how you once tried to convince us that we keep our joorhas because we learned it from European tribes? LOL.gtAmbar from Persian not Europe came first and then Amrit.Factually false especially in the Sikh context of the word. The word Amrit is used throughout the Guru Granth Sahib and Sikh texts to refer to what effectively is best translated as ambrosia. The word is specifically spelled Amrit not Ambar and this is where the term Amrit as used in Amritsar Khande da Amrit etc. comes from.Amrit is actually a Sanskrit word. What legitimate linguists have figured out is that there was a protoIndoEuropean language thats the grandfather of Sanskrit Greek and Latin which is why there are similarities in those languages. But whatever words Punjabi has inherited comes from the Sanskrit branch of that tree NOT the greeklatin side of it. The rest of your post is just random rambling here and there some of which I agree with there are certainly TurkishPersian loanwords and the other which suffers from the same fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between protoIndoEuropeanGreekSanskritLatin.,Sikh,dg9kxra,1,t5_2rfo4
11589364,0,t3_65b3qy,The Sikh Awareness campaign starts today with commercials to air on CNN. I watched one on Facebook and they say We are Seek. I think  people in the ad pronounce it Sick. This is kinda confusing for people isnt it?,Sikh,dg9nueb,5,t5_2rfo4
11627129,0,t1_dgdni07,Yes but these are all unified under the authority of the Vedas we as Sikhs reject the Vedas as our way of realising God. Im not saying you cant realise truth using the Vedas indeed it contains much wisdom but it does give rise to a wide range of contrasting thoughts as you have pointed out for us Sikhs we are unified into a single defined approach with the Gurus as our authority and as a means to realising nonduality through submitting our ego to them.,Sikh,dgdy46u,5,t5_2rfo4

11767551,0,t1_dgouact,This is surprising change of tune from you turbanatore. Only recently you lambasted me for raising questions about if we are equal citizens in India and can expect to be afforded equal rightsprotection in light of the rise of Hindu nationalism and our horrific experiences post partition. This was during the kes cuttal incident. You confidently declared at the time this was some kind of conspiracy theory and far removed from reality. Unless you are naive or ignorant you would know this is not the first time such incident has taken place.Time to wake up singho. Vaheguru ji ka khalsa vaheguru ji ki fateh ,Sikh,dgtvs0d,1,t5_2rfo4
11777994,0,t1_dgumuvp,I am not following your logic. gt The purpose is to become one with god and Sikhi is just one way.If you believe this why are you so hyperfocused on your perceived shortcomings of this group? They are helping the needy and OP already said they discuss Sikhi outside and inside the Gurdwara. They even said they discussed Sikhi at the event they posted. You may want to let this one go. They are doing good they are spreading the message of Sikhi. If you want to criticize lets turn it to those of us who are doing nothing special people like me. ,Sikh,dgv2n29,1,t5_2rfo4

11795897,0,t1_dgx33de,gtWell part of Sikhi is control of your feelings such as lust and anger.Not quite true. Sikhi is about controlling the five thieves which lead to haumai but piyare for the Guru is not one of the five thieves. We dont have to control all our feelings just the ones that instil separation.Yes in the other thread I mentioned that I thought that actually anger at something like this might not be a spirituallyconductive way to think. But I never said that it was wrong or barbaric to be angry after all that feeling of grief is a natural part of love. A Gursikh should be in a condition where they cry and feel despair whenever they feel separate from the Guru Bairaag. Imagine the bairaag the grief the pain from seeing the Guru ripped to shreds?gtNever said all muslims are barbarians I said Islamic culture is. There is a strong difference.There is no difference. A barbarian is someone who has a barbaric culture whatever that is. I mean Im pretty sure we stopped talking about barbarians a hundred years ago...gtOnce again you can print out the SGGS and you would treat the printed pages with respect. This is because the content is the treasure not the paper.Destroying the paper is an insult to the content and a statement of intent to eradicate. Hitler burned books not to destroy the ideas inside them but to demonstrate his hatred for them.Plus with Puratan saroops the paper itself is irreplaceable as it contains information about the history of the Saroop and also the wider copyingediting process that SGGS went through.gtI wouldnt even go that far as theres a likely the police is going to beat the assailant blue black. I do not think it warrants someone getting the shit beaten out of them. Rather catch the person and get the reason behind it. Fine the person with certain hours of community service. Why should we use fear as a way to control people?Way too lenient. This is a probably a conspiracy to destroy public order in Punjab and anyone caught should be punished severely unless they cooperate and divulge who is organising it. Theyre inciting communal hatred and Sikhs have been killed because of this. They should be jailed for years even longer if theyre also foreign spies.,Sikh,dgx3shz,4,t5_2rfo4
11796200,0,t1_dgx4xis,Side note! I havent found any early USA historical mentions of Sikhi. Thomas Jefferson studied the Quran in the early s but that was due to the ongoing Barbary Pirate crises. ,Sikh,dgx5134,2,t5_2rfo4
11807507,0,t3_68et78,Appreciate your views. Unfortunately your views are a minority in your country and among its people. Many pakistanis speak highly of Sikhs but we have historical evidence that the nation of pakistan is intolerant towards religious minorities. Also do not forget the grooming incidents in the UK targeting specifically Sikhs. Your kind words are appreciated however words are the cheap we would like to see them in action. Any type of camaraderie we once had with our muslim punjabi brothers is now completely gone. We can barely relate to one another anymore. You guys have sold your cultureheritage to the arabians.  We now fight directly against each other in kashmir and let us not forget that it is these pakistani punjabis that are polluting the Indian punjab with Afghani heroin. Overall we are now  completely distinct people that are at odds with one another.  This essentially goes back to what I said before in another thread Sikhs will be wary of pakistan until trust can be rebuilt.On a lighter note in the west young Indians and Pakistanis tend to drop their differences and unite as one. ,Sikh,dgyf74f,-3,t5_2rfo4
