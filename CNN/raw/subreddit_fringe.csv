664295,0,t1_cgfqm43,Me too it was so good.  Well I dont think it was anywhere near as good as Fringe BrBa Suits Hannibal etc. but it was such a good idea and it got addictive to see how things played out.  Even just discussing theories with friends made it worth watching.,fringe,cgfs2v5,2,t5_2qii0

1103616,0,t1_chtkex6,I agree with you. The whole episode feels... stilted and contrived which is very unlike most of Fringe. A lot of Fringe might actually BE contrived but it doesnt FEEL like it.The best episode  in my opinion is the one from Season  where its not actually episode . Walters montypython jaunt is so unexpected and so wonderfully executed that it very nearly made ME feel stoned.,fringe,chtqkbp,6,t5_2qii0

3825573,0,t1_cqsbnxc,The only time they mentioned him was in that episode in Septembers mind after the big bang. The Observers had had no interaction with the main characters up until that point in the current timeline and no one else could have remembered Henry.

8608840,0,t1_d6dnyzk,Ill see? Ive seen the show. How does it make sense that that exact flight with all the same people suddenly takes place years later? The old lady is there! They just replayed the footage from the old episode until the Air Marshall comes in which is funny because the guys name is Marshall it makes no sense! To be clear in the original episode it was a drug trade by Conrad related to John Scott in the new timeline it has something to do with being a special species and his sister.And does it really work out? How did the machine work out? I would literally like to work with some people to figure out how all of that couldve happened without Peter.And another thing why did Peter have to have drowned? September interrupted Walternate discovering the cure so it stands to reason that Peter should be alive but on the other side!It was fun until season  and then it got dumb. AND ANOTHER THING! In season  they have the skin growth toxin but in that timeline which is and isnt a new timeline they didnt encounter DRJ the same way meaning that that shit didnt exist! There was no ZFT! How does Peters absence mean no ZFT?And if there was no Peter did Olivia who went from  to  in the Cortexiphan shit just run away? And then how would Walternate know that there was another universe.And also the other universe going from an alternate FBI to the military crap breaks the show apart completely especially considering that Olivia must be blonde over there and there were charred twins meaning another universe with Cortexiphan. So perhaps that wasnt the redheaded Olivias universe. Its insane.But I do miss Fringe. Theres nothing quite like it on TV.,fringe,d6hp8mz,2,t5_2qii0

8898433,0,t1_d7b3rh9,I didnt even bother watching last season.  At the end of the season before was that S or S?

9424486,0,t1_d9am1wb,I was with you on that. I just rewatched it with my lil sis a few months ago. When we got to season  I told her I would just explain season  from the beginning. Season four is just new timeline. Not a new universe . Same timeline except peter didnt grow up. Thats it. Now that the confusion is lifted the season can actually be pretty good. I personally enjoyed Making Angels as one of my most memorable episodes of that season. ,fringe,d9ama03,1,t5_2qii0
