2033227,0,t3_2i0kg3,When you say dont be between the  and  you can be but you need to be well in front or well behind the line of the scrumhalfs pass  depending on how deep the flyhalf is.In attack if youre not required at the ruck and there is not a forward to support float out and run a support line for the flyhalf  as JimmytheCrow says. In fact running off the flyhalfs hip is bread and butter for a lock.Either carry the ball up off his hip or clear the ruck for him or the carrier if he passes.,RugbyTraining,cky9n8u,2,t5_2ymz1

This will give you the base strength thats needed for rugby and also stay away from machines or anything that isolates a specific muscle group i know how tempting it is to do bodybuilding type exercises with a goal of increasing size but honestly strength is much more important youd never catch many pros spending time doing bicep curls. Compound movements and lifts will help your body work in sync and eliminates muscle imbalances which may lead to injury vulnerability. If you want to increase your speed tie in some plyometrics and olympic lifting which will both increase power output and thus speed. Also work on your core skills such as passing and if youre looking at flyhalf try to get some kicking practice in too.  is probably an age where you should be starting some kind of gym work and extra training on top of your clubs one or two sessions a week if you really want to excel but dont be apprehensive the fact you want to get back into the game after such a long period of time off from injury and the fact youre actively seeking helps shows that youre a committed individual. Your club should take care of your preseason fitness and the majority of sessions through the summer will take care of this. Make sure you play for your school through the winter as the best way to improve both skill and fitness in rugby is just to play as much as you possibly can. Best of luck!!,RugbyTraining,cs7cefc,4,t5_2ymz1
