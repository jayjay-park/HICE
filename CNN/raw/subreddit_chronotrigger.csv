370425,0,t3_1ybftl,Chrono trigger is the epitome of squares legacy in making RPGs. Second IMHO would be xenogears on psthink it was the same music composer too but I forget.I can play chrono over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and well I think u get the point. Everything about it makes it a masterpiece.  Chrono trigger for life. Im glad I grew up in the generation that it was released. And its a shame so many younger people will never get to experience this amazing game.,chronotrigger,cfj5ro9,5,t5_2sevh

1413727,0,t1_citgv09,Honestly one of the things about the soundtrack to Chrono Trigger that resonates with me so deeply is the incorporation of two or three motifs that recur throughout the entire game. If I had to choose three songs off the top of my head I would say Maguss theme Schalas theme and the one that plays in the ending where Crono and Marle float away on balloons I think that one was To Far Away Times. But I honestly look at the entire game soundtrack as part of one overarching song.,chronotrigger,cithn47,5,t5_2sevh

I have since gotten rid of my snes but I have the ps version and I downloaded it on my psp so now I have it in my pocket.  I threw the controller across the room when I got to the part where you finally see chrono marle and lucca and they tell you as the main character that Spoilerread the bottom for the spoiler To me that made it a side story or as some others have said a completely different game.  I just couldnt pick it back up after that. sorry i tried every spoiler tag convetion I could find and it didnt work so dont look because you didnt die our world never exsisted. ,chronotrigger,cloqkbf,1,t5_2sevh

I always wondered about the dynamic of Magus and to a far lesser extent Flea looking like a human.  Obviously he was the strongest magic wielder on the planet so its easy to get people to like you but I wonder if early in his reign some of the Mystics had doubts.And how badass is MagusJanus for subverting Ozzie as a child?,chronotrigger,cuis5p0,1,t5_2sevh

8869695,0,t1_d7c9mnl,Its been a while since Ive played but Ive always seen Robo as one of the best endgame characters! He has a fluff killer laser beam attack an area heal or was that a double tech? a great physical single target rocket punch AND a pretty decent AoE magic attack shockwave all with MP costs lower than most other moves in the same class. He also has GREAT triple tech possibilities and with the lower MP cost he was always the one with the rock. I usually had golden studs on all my other chars.Thinking back this may be more tuned to postgame as opposed to endgame.,chronotrigger,d7e0gkc,2,t5_2sevh

9483111,0,t1_d9hy31x,Music  This one is completely subjective so Ill give SoE and SoM a tie here even though I feel personally Evermore has the better ost. I still remember the music to this day and even use it as a ringtone occasionally. Jeremy Soule really hit it out of the park.Art  The sprite work for Evermore is unquestionably superior to mana. The environments characters enemiesbosses and citiesvillages all look tons better. Manas sprites are not bad by any means but they look washed out by comparison.Combat  I remember Mana having a lot of weapons a lot of which were either bad or felt identical to others. The fact the each weapon had  levels for you to grind through whose  levels that you had to wait through when charging your weapon during combat and the fact that a lot of the level attacks are identical to lower levels but only do more damage makes for quite a bit of tedium and irritation. Evermore had fewer weapons with less levels but each weapon felt completely unique as did the attacks at each level. Magic on the other hand I really dont remember much about. Maybe it didnt stand out or wasnt very good? I dont know. Evermore had a very memorable and cool magic system called alchemy where you collected ingredients for spells to use. They mostly all had very cool animations and were fun to use.Story  This is another spot I feel Evermore beats Mana. Mana had a generic fantasy save the world storyline that wed seen too many times before. Evermores was different though. It was about a normal boy and his dog from a small town in our world who get stranded in another dimension and are just trying to get home. Every boy can relate to that moreso with his quips and anecdotes about science fiction bmoves and other stuff. Hes fun and relatable. The characters from Mana while interesting are flat shallow and dont have nearly the depth.The world of Evermore also felt more alive. The towns were bustling with many interesting people and it was great trading and bartering with merchants for the different artifacts all of which had different passive abilities. It had lots of secrets and easter eggs as well from FF character cameos to all the hidden alchemy spells. I truly love this game.,chronotrigger,d9hzx9t,3,t5_2sevh
