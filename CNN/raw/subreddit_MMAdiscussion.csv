5151733,0,t1_cv6y8yi,It is a tough thing to think about size. DJ is a monster there is no doubt about that. The only problem is that he doesnt seem as dominant as when JJ fought. DJ carries with him a skill level that makes him look unstoppable. Yet the way that JJ fought made him look invincible. Even after the Gus fight.The issue lies with opponents and what they have done with them. DJ has had great fighters in the other corner but he dismantles them with great technique and poise. JJ has managed to fight his opponents using their game plan. And won. When he fought it was truly scary. Anyways I am drunk. JJ is a monster so is DJ. I pick JJ purely because when he fought he had an air about him that was electric. DJ is amazing but does not carry himself like the other top tier fighters. His fights show it.  ,MMAdiscussion,cv6z652,2,t5_35p9s
