8703604,0,t1_d6tkejr,Thank you so much! I believe its only .x faster the video was originally  minutes and I understand not a lot of people want to watch a  minute video let alone a  minute video so I tried to make it as short as possible without cutting anything out of the video. Also yes I am using NTR and it does lag at times but when its slightly sped up its hardly noticeable. ,7thDragon,d6tl1aa,1,t5_3f8nt
