7838136,0,t1_d3wysd3,Thanks for the advice IMa and Captain.  I have opened the gas cap after it stalls and this does nothing to help the situation.  Ill check into the spark plug although if I recall correctly we did change it when we changed the fuel line... because the mower is older the design sucks and the spark plug is buried below the engine at the front and the housing doesnt come apart all too easily.  Do I need to check the spark just after its stalled or can I do it when its cold? Would there potentially be a difference?  Anything beyond checking the spark plug is beyond my experience level so Ill probably have to call a mechanic but at least now Ill have a bit more of a clue what theyre talking about when I talk to them.,smallengines,d3x2oft,1,t5_31zdx
8148129,0,t3_4oknr6,Try removing the spark plug and pulling it. If it turns your compression release valve is bad. If thats the case then contact Predator and order a new valve. If it still doesnt turn without the spark plug then something is siezed up on the inside. If thats the case then youre pretty much screwed.,smallengines,d4w2ad1,1,t5_31zdx

8643337,0,t3_4y9hy1,Accidentally broke off the little  deg. Piece that connect to it. I have another carb with a similar little brass inlet so I could replace it if I knew how to safely remove it. I tried unscrewing with channelocks on a junker carb with no luck. Is it removable or should I try something else?,smallengines,d6m103h,1,t5_31zdx

10930475,0,t1_de6tz5m,Yeah I believe its called Trufuel works wonders and although its  a quart it means less downtime and carburetor problems in the long run,smallengines,de7egqn,1,t5_31zdx
