229360,0,t3_1wnswv,Mumble isnt a viable alternative because one of the core features of the game is leagueranked play which you have to queue solo. So if thats the main mode youre playing then you never have the ability to effectively communicate with your team in whats supposed to be a highly competitive and team oriented game.Theyre definitely placing their selves behind the likes of Dota by not addressing the voip issue. That said Hi Rezs servers are terrible Im not sure if they could effectively support voip right now.,GlobalAgenda2,cf4irka,2,t5_2v6z4
352350,0,t1_cfgru7f,I thought they lost the source code to knowing what global agenda was. Anyways I started reading these they get better after the first scene which has some funky writing. Well worth it. I feel like these should be in the game to and read click through full screen in some libraryarchivehistory room of the next domeplace we live in. I think I would have enjoyed reading them at some point in my time playing GA but NOT in the course of quests.  As an aside I dont think quest text works at all actually it doesnt align with the mindset of someone who wants to kill things  progress.  I think it is far better and more realistic to just offer some kind of normal believable context for an event as in not standing there for a minute with a motionlessness NPC talking about how you need to stop the chopper from taking off behind you and then doing the whole journal entry thing. My point is you dont need quests to tell a story. If this thing was just sitting in a console in dome and I can read it as if I was staring at my tablet I would. ,GlobalAgenda2,cfhaecc,1,t5_2v6z4
514333,0,t3_1zyyvl,Basically the only way I ever see GA increasing its player count again is with HiRezs involvement preferably starting with them apologising to the community.At best by yourself you might get enough people to pop the merc queue with scheduled events or get enough people to create a SF and troll the AvA farmers. Whatever you do dont spend money towards trying to revitalise this game yourself it will be a waste of money.,GlobalAgenda2,cfyqe6t,1,t5_2v6z4

1348144,0,t1_cikkelu,In my experience nukes were one of the pieces of tech with the lowest skill ceiling in the game. Sure they could be used to funnel enemies and force a fight somewhere off point for a very short time but in the vast majority of cases they were just dumped on point as a way to take down the building shields. Wide availability of nukes drastically changed the defenders advantage on most maps.,GlobalAgenda2,cila5ud,1,t5_2v6z4

2243278,0,t1_clof14n,Why am I here? Because I can be? First off I didnt say I didnt want to speculate. I said there was no point. You are ranting about medic being gone when thats most likely not the case. This is my issue. People read this and think medic is gone. It makes people uninterested and no one wants that. You want to speculate?gt One of the things that has been on my mind with Global Assault is the underlying feeling this game will have without medics.  So what you mean is without a dedicated healing gun? Yah big difference. gt Will it maintain its heavily teamoriented focus firing game play...  Thanks to v it wont be as heavily teamoriented. I am sure teamplay and focus fire will still be necessary but not as much.gt ...or will teams of will people be selfsufficient one man armies branching out to attack objectives on multiple angles and paths like CSGO? v will allow one man armies yes. Less players makes an easier carry. As far as branching out goes I think that there will be a possibility that teams will be forced to split up and perform highly coordinated tasks especially in Siege and Control game modes. gt Will the need and desire to fight as a group AT ALL TIMES be gone? If you mean running around in that  man pack thanks to Global Agenda yes. If you mean being a team by communicating developing strategy and executing a game plan...no. gt Breach and Payload might hold everyone together for sure but what will sustain long meaningful battles? Could these modes get reworked such that there is only one objective each match and the maps are set to provide more individuality more selfreliance more options like CSGO bomb planting? This is actually a major concern to me as well. I believe there will inevitably be tweaks to the maps and objectives but all I know at this point is the name of the three game modes. Their names point out an obvious objective. Siege Taking charge of an common objective or enemy base by controlling or destroying said objective. When I think of Siege I think of fast paced game play that requires a significant amount coordination on both offense and defense. Battles will more than likely be long. High competitive play potential due to low tolerance of failure. A lot of thought will need to go into this mode on an eSports level. Planning will be big for this game mode.Push Similar to Payload I assume. The objective will need to be guarded and transported from Point A to B. SlowerPaced because you will probably have to move with the objective. Battles will be continuous. The idea of this game mode is solid but we will have to see how it does in Global Assault.Control Similar to Control in Global Agenda I bet. Everything depends on how they develop this mode in Global Assault.gt I just cant wrap my head around what the game will feel like without that source of mitigation and renewal. Dont then wait and see. Patience is a virtue.gt You might just say everyone will be basically be a giant walking rrrrrrrnnnnnn mod but without a healing wave you would guess that everyone is going to using regen every cooldown. I dont see this as an evolution of gameplay. Without a healing wave? So now healing wave is gone too? I wonder where that misconception came from. HiRez wont be nb about game play development. They have learned a lot from all of their games and I am betting they are capable of making a game that doesnt include silly routines such as the one you have stated.      gt However I cant help but wonder what role Smite will play in the influence and direction of the game in light of these circumstances. I think you are looking at this the wrong way. HiRez has a team of developers making Smite. While some positions will overlap in the development of both games if Global Assault does well there is the possibility that HiRez will build another team to solely work on Global Assault. gt One things I can think of seeing in the game are the two innate  special skills you get in LoL and Smite. Theres a possibility.gt The other solution which would totally remove ths of GAs influence but would poise this game to provide a more casual v vs v counterpunch to the rising tide of oncoming arena shooters is to offer strategic spawns on the map. I just noticed nothing was said about spawning or respawns at all yet. I would hate to say goodbye to drop ship and beacons. If they gets removed I just hope the next idea is better. Waiting to hear more on this if we get more updates between now and the play test.gt Whether it is weapon boosts armor boots healing etc there could be capturableobtainabledestroyable areas of influence spawns or avatech like resources that players could fight over that would provide the means to sustain a push or defense. This was big in SMNC. SMNC was a great game in my opinion and displayed many MOBA type elements. It workedsometimes but in regards to Global Assault I dont think that areas of influence like camps and other side objectives would work in every game mode. They proved to be distracting in casual SMNC game play and it didnt help team play as much as it should have. The biggest concern to me right now has to be learning curve. Lets be honest low ping and a good PC made GA pretty easy. I dont want Global Assault to be the hardest game in the world but I want it to be a little more difficult than Global Agenda...,GlobalAgenda2,cloz25j,0,t5_2v6z4

2327698,0,t3_2lx06k,Personally one of the ways I choose what games to dedicate my time to is by popularity. If a game has a solid player base its more likely to be supported for a long time and match quality is usually better. Its also part of the reason people gravitate toward LoL and DotA and now SMITE instead of Dawngate HoN or other mobas. GA wont be able to compete with Overwatch on that level at least not for a while.,GlobalAgenda2,clzf02n,2,t5_2v6z4

6989505,0,t1_d18izse,You can make a game accessible without destroying the skill cap. Notions of accessibility shouldnt even have an impact on direct gameplay. It should entail feature pacing a tutorial bots and easy to understand uimenus. The other big thing is people have to know how and why they failed. I worry about Paladins cards because a new person is going to be up against so many different combos without the ability to replicate and experiment in meaningful ways. It could be frustrating to get trampled and not be sure how or why. I know when I played I would go to the menu and try to understand why an opponent was so effective and it wasnt always clear. I guess to me accessible means people can understand how to improve and are given the tools to do so. If a game isnt grindpaywin I dont think it matters how hard it is. An even footing and some clarity means its available to anyone currently playing pvp games. GA in this sense was NOT accessible. Whether it was skill points or armor mods or weapon damage new people were at a disadvantage when they started and AGAIN after countless hours they were reset to a WORSE position at .   If you mean accessible to many different people with different tastes then Ill say its  pointless to make a pvp game with that in mind if it doesnt run on a macbook or iphone. You have to have an original  in a million idea. ,GlobalAgenda2,d18loo8,3,t5_2v6z4
