1894538,0,t1_ckhh7s8,FINALLY! Hopefull they will do this for all the Sentai Eventually even if they only do it from Zyuranger on and only have the series that they imported for power rangers. Maybe we will actually get a full Sub of Ohranger,supersentaipublic,ckhhd8l,1,t5_2xx1s

4759991,0,t1_ctry3m0,I dont know some of these episodes seem not that Takaharucentric.It kinda feels like its extremely Takaharu or not at all.  And a lot of the times when it isnt Kasumi takes the spotlight hard.For instance Taka had barely any screen time this episode.  He had a hand in the finisher but that was about it.  He was a comedic element much like bluestar and one other comedic element in the beginning.  It didnt seem like he was in this episode too much.,supersentaipublic,ctujis9,1,t5_2xx1s
