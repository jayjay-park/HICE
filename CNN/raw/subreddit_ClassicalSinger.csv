1571353,0,t1_cjajfu5,Thank you for the honest response!Im aware of what youre saying and am concerned that I might not be a true bass. Trouble is I have zero interest in singing as a baritone. The sound nor the songs appeal for the most part. I know Im being silly and stubborn...oh well.When you say the bass voice takes a while to develop  and Ive heard this before  how do you mean? Lets say a true bass voice has a range EG bit like Samuel Ramey. Do you mean that until its developed that it wont have full range? Or that the sound is crappy until then?I always try to sing in ways which feel comfortablehave no tensiondoesnt feel like Im forcing anything and I suppose that a subset of those ways can overlap with that of faking a sound. Hard for me to know though. Not having a teacher etc. But then itd have to be the right teacher to make any difference. If Im singing comfortably with as efficient use of breath as possible and good messa di voce I wonder whats the worst that could happen to my vocal health. Are these possible repercussions you speak of truly damaging and irreversible?What do you think of Ramey? You know I actually suspect him of not being a true bass. His sound feels very manufactured to me...and the huge wobble that he has developed. I have the belief that healthy technique should lead one to sing well well past their s as Hines did to . In fact Hines thought Ramey wasnt much of a bass either Thanks again no parade rained on! I try to keep myself in check with things like this. Honesty helps.,ClassicalSinger,cjd8qyr,2,t5_2vxt3

Maybe you should try someone new even if it is just a local choir director or something.Support is one of many things that cause intonation issues.  And being a natural doesnt mean it is perfect.  You may have a great start but a great start is very different from great technique.  Being a wind player doesnt mean your breath support is where it needs to be to prevent intonation problems.  Also establishing the basics is a standard voice teacher thing to do.  Even professionals who are trying out a new teacher for the first time spend at least some time at the beginning going over the basics.  Im not saying the lessons were great or helpful in any way but I thought it was worth mentioning.As for teachers just wanting to teach you scales and songs... Um those are the tools they use to teach technique.  Just because you can hit all the notes in a B minor scale doesnt mean you sing them well.  If I read your comment wrong I apologize.Edit just listened to your recording.  It sounds to me like youve got a bit of tension somewhere which can mess with things like this.  The best thing you can do right now is to stop listening to yourself when you sing and focus on the feeling. Sympathetic resonation bone conduction etc. etc. keeps us from hearing what our voices really sound like.  It might also do you well to sing some scales focusing on keeping the transitions between registers as smooth as possible.  Your jumping up and down may be part of whats causing the intonation problems when you land on a new faraway note especially when you switch registers.  A mind trick is to not think of jumping up and down with the pitches but to think of it as a continuous line moving forward.  Honestly the register thing is something best worked out with a teacher in person so you can learn where your breaks are and whats the best way for YOU to navigate them.  Good luck!,ClassicalSinger,ck7nui4,1,t5_2vxt3

5849469,0,t1_cxm9g6x,I wish I could upvote this more than once! I think the real trick is variety. Singing can seem so foreign and difficult to comprehend and its all about building a mental image in the singers mind about how everything coordinates together and what to do to address problems as they come up. And for most people this means addressing things from different angles to build that overall mental map which over time becomes more precise and easier to control. ,ClassicalSinger,cxme6vu,1,t5_2vxt3
6885060,0,t1_d0whu38,Thats a fair point. Im not so much saying that opera singers shouldnt have anything else going on in their lives I just dont know that vocally focusing elsewhere is not necessarily ideal. I dont think its fair to say that people who focus their vocal efforts purely on classical singing dont also live varied lives. ,ClassicalSinger,d0wql30,1,t5_2vxt3

10497036,0,t3_5q8uev,There are a bunch of different conventions about what the darkening of a voice actually is. Sometimes yes the voice will mature from a baritone to a bass getting darker at the same time.Whatever you do be sure to talk to your voice teachers about how to prevent unintentional unhealthy darkening. This would manifest as tongue tension in the back of your throat and a tight jaw while singing. Lots of younger baris do this technique because they sound woofier darker and older. In reality its jamming the vocal mechanism down slowing down and widening the vibrato. If you sing in a choira cappella group be sure to consciously gauge your tonguejaw relaxation. Its a common practice in choirs and a cappella groups to try and have all the BarisBasses sound like Russian Basso Profundos and forcing your voice to do that when it hasnt matured is disaster. TlDR Yes darkening can happen naturally. You cant predict it. Dont force it or itll fuck up your voice.,ClassicalSinger,dcxy6z2,5,t5_2vxt3
10888931,0,t1_de2fn2s,Thanks a bunch!At the moment lyric bass but maybe bassbaritone in a couple of years when I secured my higher range. Dont mind pretty modern things I would think its mostly technical problem that would occur. As long its not over an e but Im always in for a challenge. ,ClassicalSinger,de346du,1,t5_2vxt3
