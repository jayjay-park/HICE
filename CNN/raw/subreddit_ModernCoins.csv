The Nanjing mint of the Peoples Republic of China PRC is doing this exact thing right nowThe Nanjing mint is waiting for instructions tell me your opinion ASAP What should the weight be for a Nanjing  gold panda?  ChineseCoinsgt  . Although it may not be imminent there is some prospect of the worlds coinage systems shifting from ounce weights to metric weights ...China has done this by debasing their fiat  oz . grams pandas down to  grams. This has been tried and it has failed miserably many times in the past and Im not sure how this time is going to be any different. For example the gold pandas began in  with standard  oz and fractional weights and it was a wild success on the first day. In  silver pandas were introduced but they were only  grams not the full  oz . grams. China minted substandard metric pandas in   and  but sales were so poor the silver pandas were canceled in  leaving only the gold pandas. By  the government of China finally realized it isnt silver people dont like its SUBSTANDARD WEIGHTS that people dont like. The silver pandas were reintroduced with standard  oz . g weights and they have been massproduced ever since.gt  . The U.S. Mint should consider the issue of legal tender precious metals coinage that is legal tender on the basis of its weight and not with reference to dollars. This was done in South Africa when the Krugerrand was introduced in .I like this idea but it will never happen for political reasons. It would threaten the fiat USD as a unit of account worldwide.gt  . The U.S. Mint should review proposals to issue circulating coinage containing a quantity of silver ... at a cost below face value ... the public may hoard such coins ... it would yield additional operating profits to the Mint as well as fostering more collectors.This is a very novel idea! How ingenious! Right now the worlds mints are directly trying to persuade people to buy their coins. With this method it will be like a treasure hunt to find the ones that have silver in them and take them out of circulation. The mint makes a little money the public makes a little money and not a single extra penny is spent on advertising shipping packaging etc.gt  . The U.S. Mint has a history of striking coins for many foreign countries. ... perhaps the Mint could sell to collectors sets of coins struck for other nations.The Chinese mints are famous for accepting sponsored work where a consortium of sponsors agree to  pay for the costs of their pet coin series and handle all marketing sales and distribution themselves. This line of business is in decline in China because the total net profits are far better for the highest mintage coins even when they have far smaller profit margins. For example the mint earns far more money with  profit on  million coins than they earn with  profit on  coins. Theoretically someone could sponsor those high mintage coins too but the costs are so high only governments can afford to sponsor such high mintages and only governments have a market for that many coins as circulating currency. That is why Im an eager investor in the last few low mintage coins the Chinese mints are still producing. There are  official mints in the PRC and only  of them still agrees to do low mintage coins without excessive costs. The biggest mint in Shanghai has been discouraging minting runs of less than  coins and that number keeps ticking higher. Eventually it might be like the US Mint where only governments can afford to sponsor minting of their own coins.,ModernCoins,d87yjt0,1,t5_3fuf6
