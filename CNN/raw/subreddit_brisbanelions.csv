488216,0,t1_cfvfnmf,Absolutely and really overrated easier jobs. Sure Patful is rarely beaten but how much does he contribute to us winning games. He is a good defender but we rarely win because out defence is shutting out the opposing forwards. I think it should have been Rich or Redden two years ago and last year it was hard to separate Leuey Rocky and Hanley.,brisbanelions,cfvri6l,1,t5_2v4qc

7825664,0,t3_4mh7qm,gt Rocky stared with  possessions and a goalWhat an absolute fucking beast that bloke is. Makes a huge difference to our side and puts in some serious effort. I really do love Rocky as a player but I still have doubts about his leadership.gt Schache took a couple nice marks and got a goal but otherwise ineffectivePoor Shack Weitering definitely got the better of him that game. Id stick with him though unless he needs a rest. Only way hes going to grow is to get some experience into him. gt Robbo Bastinac and Zorko also good all with  possessions and  tacklesThe usual suspects at this point. Zorko is turning into one of the competitions best players Robbo gives  effort every week and Bastinac does the hard stuff whilst often going under appreciated. gt What needs to change?Our accuracy is appalling and has been all season. If we could take our chances and actually fucking kick straight wed have won quite  a few more games this year. Also none of this kicking backwards shit. gt Who comes inout?Out Christensen Paine Freeman West  In Green AndrewsPaparone Walker C. Beamsgt Is the WestMartin partnership working?God no. Its like being a man down. West is a decent tap ruckman but by playing him we get a  game from Martin because neither of them know how to be a forward. Let Martin solo ruck and play as a big midfielder which he does so well and get Walker to pinch when he needs a rest. West is a definite got to go.,brisbanelions,d3vo64t,1,t5_2v4qc
9496608,0,t1_d9jgvse,Im optimistic enough to think we wont be spooners but realistic enough to think we wont be shooting up the ladder. I dunno I really think the new coach is going to deliver a more competitive game plan  already were hearing things about a culture shift and players are pulling their heads in... they may be familiar names but we could very well see a brand new Brisbane Lions team on the field in .,brisbanelions,d9jnqly,2,t5_2v4qc
