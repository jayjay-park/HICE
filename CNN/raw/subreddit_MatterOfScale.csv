1757932,0,t1_cjvi0ec,As far as I can see only completed researches go to that list. So only when you bought all the levels of a specific upgrade does it show in the completed list.  So this seems to be intentionally.  But I also think that ther should be another mechanic so that we can actually see how much we researched till now...,MatterOfScale,ck0qt2u,1,t5_32h7o

1971344,0,t3_2gzqw3,I got as far as a castle on this build before hitting the refresh button like a muppet Anyway I felt I ought to say a few words. like many others I rather hope you dont push this live as it is I think there is a ton more potential with this format than there was previously but without automation features even with plans to add them in later a lot of desire to continue is lost to meBut a few specific issues I noticed.If your site gets an event notification you cant click on the location and find the event likewise if you are on one location and there is an active event and you click off it by going to another hamlet then even if you click back immediately its gone.There is very little documentation of what things do managers for example I saw his rating go up with each completed hamlet but spending  votes on him seemed to do nothing and he couldnt be unassigned. personally I think a manager should have their own research tree with unlocks like binding them to multiple sites and the autobuys rather than standing  changes.I assume you still need to balance ranks  so wont comment overmuch on them other than to say that their presence limits my desire to purchase upgrades for lower tiers in all but a few specific circumstances unlocking tier  is worth more than doubling  etc..Finally I think you now move up to the higher city ranks too fast to be honest and there doesnt seem to be any reason for continuing lower levels at all at that point were they increasing the number of higher rank cities? I had  castle  town  villages and  hamlets so I guess something did. but clicking was becoming a major chore so I didnt go for more hamlets.Id suggest here is where you could get your flat  bonus for example by leveling each individual slot each time it completes its hamlet analogous to anti idles garden. For example every time  hamlets in slot  are completed village slot  gets whatever  bonus money then  village completions do the same for a town.That gives a more constant incrimination that cascades up the hierarchy as you play and retains some semblance of your original gameplay but hey its your game you dont need to listen to any of us.,MatterOfScale,ckqqx4y,1,t5_32h7o
1982049,0,t1_ckr4j84,Oh yeah now I remember.I am avoiding making save work right now because I would likely have to wipe saves now and then as I fix bugs.  Someone gets a save in a bad state and I either have to track down and fix just their save or they keep submitting weird bug reports. But the bugs are slowly dying so we will see.Thanks for all the testing!,MatterOfScale,cks1d27,1,t5_32h7o

4579839,0,t1_ct7v23m,gt  would suggest that each quest must be unique at time unless you have more locations than quests available E.g. only if you have no  income from Bloodhound active the quest can be added or all available quests have been exhausted i.e. a second round of quests is opened. This would be amazing if only for variety its goddamn boring to see  or  of the same quest running at a time that basically means you play the exact same thing in multiple locations.One possible hiccup. This would only help to speed up play if there are less stall quests than locations. ,MatterOfScale,ct7w5wr,2,t5_32h7o

4860109,0,t1_cu74a8i,The point is that because you do have to do some clicking that is a lot of villages that are going to pile up overnight which is going to really take its toll on the page.,MatterOfScale,cu75j97,1,t5_32h7o
