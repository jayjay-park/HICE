7932254,0,t3_4bsvjl,Alex from Denmark reporting for service!   years old studying at Aarhus University currently finishing the finals of my th semester sleeping way too much. I guess Im a Snorlax really but my favorite Pokmon is Ducklett! Ive loved Pokmon since I watched the anime as a kid the Danish dub is an experience and Im immensely excited for Go. Ive played some Ingress but theres not a lot going on in Denmark so Im hoping PkmnGo is gonna be something big and awesome! I just hope my phone will be able to run it... If not I guess its time for a new phone anyway. Poor wallet.  I dont travel a whole lot outside of the country but I have an extensive knowledge about Denmark in regards to how to get around and such.  Im looking forward to befriending you all!,WesternEuropeSR,d47nrxs,1,t5_3d7hi
