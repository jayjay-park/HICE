956826,0,t3_251i7r,Depends on if you are talking about pipe tobacco cigarettes or ones rolled with real pipe tobacco. A lot of companies sell cigarette tobacco labeled as pipe tobacco to avoid taxing. This tobacco is thinly cut and obviously for cigarettes so its pretty easy to tell which bag is which. The only reason you would want to roll a cigarette with actual pipe tobacco is if you wanted to quickly enjoy smoking a pipe without loading a bowl ie you dont inhale just enjoy the aroma and flavor of the smoke. So if you rolled one with actual pipe tobacco I can totally see how it went poorly for you.,CigaretteRolling,chd1sos,2,t5_2wj19
