Its mentioned in the about text... like an afterthought. They even hid the cameras from view. The video purports to use commercially available quadrotors which implies that to implement this is somehow cheaper than the GRASP lab... they used the same exact equipment to get almost identical results.

111372,0,t1_ceqromk,For classes like   and  why cant the CS department offer grading positions to juniorsseniors in CS that have done well in the course they are trading for? For  I know its not possible I think you gave the reason on reddit or on your webpage or something but for the lower level classes it seems doable. The first reason that pops into my head is that it becomes an integrity issue by having students grade other students who may be their peers. This can be avoided by not letting the student graders know whos work they are evaluating by putting a piece of tape over the name or whatever. What are the other reasons I assume there are more? Because the main issue seems to be that there are not enough graders. The space issue can be resolved by online copies of the lectures. Although Im not sure about discussions. ,UIUC,cer425h,2,t5_2qkxs

397651,0,t1_cfl3p0i,Im going to explain in ALL CAPS because you clearly dont get it.The point is that a private builder has no guarantee that heshe will recoup costs.  It turns spending money on projects into business ventures.  Without the government taxing and spending money for the people the people now have the power to spend money on projects they seem just.  Property owners leasing agencies local business etc. all have incentives to ensure the area is an attractive place for investment and for people to move to.  Sidewalks for example may be attractive to individuals with kids.  As such individuals in Champaign for example may privately invest in sidewalks.  This may increase demand for housing in the area which may increase property value.  If more people are attracted to the Champaign area then local businesses services have been stimulated as well.  The incentives for private investors are very different than those of government.  Government wastefully spends money on many not all projects that have less value then they cost and the people have little direct say as to how the money will be allocated.  Private investment  on the other hand gives power to the people to spend their money as they see fit.  As such they will only invest in projects that will bring them an equal amount or higher value than what they cost.,UIUC,cflzdkb,1,t5_2qkxs

Therefore I wouldnt say it is caused totally by social disapproval.Dysphoria is pain caused by the mismatch between someones brain and body. It is a mental condition. The consequences are probably unfamilar if you are cisgendered  but dysphoria can be unimaginably painful.gt So I am focusing more on the pain people have when they have gender dysphoria rather than gender dysphoria itself.Dysphoria is that pain.Societal lack of acceptance can be intensely painful as well but it is not dysphoria.

That could have given people a little bit of planning time.  Instead they sent notes to IT people to share with their supported users again doesnt address the unsupported user problem and they also sent it to Deans and Department Heads.Sending to Deans and Dept. Heads is awesome but getting the important info to filter down to the student running the lab is damned near impossible  the Dept. head needs to think its important enough to forward it to faculty and staff.

Better to go talk to the people in the ECE advising office right after you come back from break try and get ahold of Basar or Schmitz Kudekis helpful as well but he pretty much dislikes people going into anything software related so he might have some other opinions on that matter. But try and get it done soon because as the year ends the office has more paperwork to do with seniorsmasters and will try putting you off plus registration is coming up fast and nonCE majors can be restricted from registering to some CECS courses.,UIUC,cgdytu7,1,t5_2qkxs

Ikenberry is far away from the engineering quad but its serviced by a very busy bus stop that will take you anywhere on campus. Also youll see a variety of majors and its generally more social although not always than other dorms. Plus the dining hall is pretty darn good. Also youre really close to the main Ikenberry building which ROCKS. It has a nice gym lots of study space a really nice library and a coffee cafe. I recommend against living in PAR.

810137,0,t3_23dw8p,Im a former professor and I caught a lot of plagiarists over the years. In your case cheating might be the more usual term.As a rule once I had clear evidence I failed students for the assignment and told them if it happened again Id fail them for the course. I also reported the plagiarism to my department which I was required to do. I included whatever documentation I had  correspondence with the student evidence of the plagiarism itself as well as my class policies and any instructional materials that had prepared students to know how to avoid it. This last bit is important classes should have policies about what constitutes the boundaries of academic integrity for that particular kind of coursework. If they dont the default definition is in the Student Handbook  Sometimes with the departments approval I also forwarded the case to the students college office so that a record of the case would go in their file in case they were found to have plagiarized in other courses. I would do that in a case of willful plagiarism  rather than accidental plagiarism. Repeated infractions to the universitys code of academic integrity could mean course failure or expulsion from the university  but its doubtful that this would be the penalty for a first offense. Of course I took a harder line if the student continued to lie on top of having plagiarized. That just shows poor judgment on top of a lapse in character.,UIUC,cgwd80o,5,t5_2qkxs

874550,0,t3_241ghe,Do you have a very good reason for taking CS  over the summer? I really recommend against it especially if you consider yourself a weak programmer.Not only is the course fast paced in the summer its also the most important CS course opinion youll take.

875107,0,t1_ch30hk7,Seriously? I disagree with you on almost every account. Im not sure why you say that the administration is absolutely atrocious  yes there are changes from semester to semester as different professors teach the courses but I have no idea what makes you say that they are the most disorganized unfairly graded classes. I have yet to be in a single ME class that I thought was unfairly graded and the only standout class that I can think of that had any fiasco whatsoever was ME  last semester  and even then most everyone I know agreed that they got a grade that was fair or even above what they thought was fair.How are no curriculum based incentives being offered for extracurriculars? You clearly havent heard of ME  an open seminar that can give you anywhere from  to  credit hours per semester for doing an independent study design project or participating in one of the everpopular SAE teams. Heck you can do your senior design requirement through SAE or an independent study.What exactly does MechSE do to take the worst from both theoretical and practical? Theres been a growing push for more practical hands on applications  a push that can be seen by the recent changes to ME   and the push for ME  to become the sophomorelevel ME  set to happen next fall. Of course with a restructured curriculum thereve been uncertainties in how to run these classes but even as someone in  after having taken  last semester I dont think it has taken the class in a negative direction. In fact everyone who I know took the class earlier lamented that the class was essentially useless and has gotten much better with the project changes.Along that note of the projectsbased classes MechSE has grown and will continue to grow in the next few years for resources for undergraduate students. This past year the full function of our MechSE design studio has been opened with  D printers  lasercutters and a host of power tools and design space to work on classroom projects. This last year we also got a new FDM rapid prototyping machine in the Ford RP lab that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Moving forward MechSEs getting a new mechatronics lab next to the Ford lab for undergrads interested in electromechanical systems and the department has been granted s of a million dollars every year for the next five years just to renovate our already impressive undergraduate labs. Looking even further into the future theres even a huge MEB renovation that is already underway to bring the building more into the modern era.Yes its true that MechSE is no longer tied for th and now sits at th but I honestly am not appalled as you seem to be about it. Rankings fluctuate and tied for th one year and th the other isnt exactly impending doom about the fall of the department.Lastly I find it funny that you compare MechSE so negatively against CS which is known for being more crowded by the day and students are being forced to stay at the university longer because they cant get into the classes they need to to graduate. My roommate is a CS major and seemingly all his professors have difficult to understand thick accents and make no effort to help students in their classes  something Ive never seen in MechSE.To answer your question utransferdog the department is fairly full but I would not call it overcrowded  as I highlighted in my post there are many resources available to us as students here and almost everyone I know can get into the classes they want even if sometimes it requires a little persistence although I would not think this uncommon in other departments as well. And research is widely available to those who actually show interest and ask for it.,UIUC,ch3r536,3,t5_2qkxs

But that garage still seems like it could have been done better but it could have been worse as well.

There are some higher interest rate options but I think Ally is notable to me because there is no minimum balance interest compounds daily so if you transfer money in and out often you dont have to worry about months or quarters and I found the transfers relatively quicker than Barclays.GE Capital Bank might be an interesting option too but I havent looked into it. Ally attempts to be competitive by having a high interest rate and theyve consistently been on or near the top.Another more innovative option is SmartyPig which has a high APY . and also focuses on helping consumers save by creating goals. I dont know much about them. EDIT I recommend doing research on this if youre interested. This might not be a normal bank account.Id look into interest rates for local banks but its rare for any to be as high as in the link I provided. Interest rates are very low right now due to the Feds reaction to the recession so these online options are likely the best bet.Is there a particular reason you want a local bank?

The answers to those questions give us insight into what employers are seeking today.For better or for worse employers are not taking any risks on theory right now.

3181585,0,t1_corr0kj,gtstem majors never learn to communicate well with people outside their fields.It isnt fair to put all the blame on STEM majors though. Communication is a two way street. I have spent a lot of time teaching STEM to other people. And what I have found is that effectively communicating STEM isnt an easy task especially to people who have little to no STEM background. When I start talking about exciting STEM advances to nonSTEM majors Im frequently asked to stop because they dont have the background to understand. I offer to break out a whiteboard and walk backward to visually draw out the basic concepts they dont yet understand but its still very difficult to keep their interest. And most of the time they change the subject instead of taking up my offer to explain using a whiteboard. The level of detail that must be transmitted for even the most basic concept in STEM is high and an advanced STEM major has likely already forgotten which concepts were difficult to them as a beginner.gtbut to me that doesnt negate the authors point of view it indicates a larger problem with the cost and values of higher education.Thats a great point. This is why I like sites like Coursera KhanAcademy Codecademy and Code.org. They are taking the steps to bring basic STEM knowledge to the masses by breaking it down into manageable portions even where many traditional institutions have failed. The goals are fundamentally different though where traditional institutions need to write grant proposals campaign for funding pay rent pay bills keep the lights on and make payroll a lightweight nonprofit website is run by volunteers and donations.This is also why I think most  year institutions dont post their materials online for free  if they do that they are out of a job. In fact most professors I have had so far dont let us copy or keep their class materials lectures or exams. Contrast that to the MOOC model where everything is released for free in perpetuity. ,UIUC,corrqxz,2,t5_2qkxs
3181716,0,t1_cor1ygf,I moved here for a very specific company that I had been following for more than a year before graduating. They hired me because of my specific interest in their niche products and for my experience. I really cant speak about how companies generally interview out here but it does seem like it would be considerably easier to get a job once you already live here. Honestly the SoCal culture isnt really for me and when Im done with this job I will be looking to move. The weather is great but the cost of living is high and the culture is a bit more materialistic and selfcentered than Im used to. NorCal has the better vibe for sure.,UIUC,cors8mn,2,t5_2qkxs

3225232,0,t1_cow9b8h,gt ll correct this to say that my implication was that from the purview of the federal government possession of personal recreational amounts of marijuana would not be a concern and thus effectively decriminalized on a federal level.Out of those persons in federal prison for drugrelated crimes only  around  are there for possession rather than trafficking. Federal prosecutors arent interested in simple possession. The personalrecreational amounts that you describe are almost entirely left to the states to deal with. gtIf he were to consider the overwhelming popular support for marijuana legalization it would definitely be within his authority to make the call that the population would want him to devote energy to other security priorities. Hah thats a nice politicianfriendly way to put it. What you are describing is an enforcement gap. Actually no  the precedent is the opposite way. Its one thing to say that the Federal government wont defend a piece of legislation subject to judicial review and another to say that they they wont enforce it. The former is contentious precedent even recently. The later doesnt happen except in super rare cases where constitutionality is disputed or that one time when Obama decided that he wouldnt enforce some immigration laws yet to be challenged by someone with standing  normally its understood to be a violation of the Presidents Constitutional duties and subject to private suit and judicial review. Presidents have stated this in the past. Heres a recentish example the Clinton administration refused to defend the Constitutionality of the HIVprovisions of the  NDAA as he understood it to violate the equal protection clause. He urged Congress to undo the law before it went into effect  but acknowledged that the executive will enforce the law while not defending it during judicial review. Quinn and Dellinger Briefing on HIV provision Feb  . Same goes for Obama deciding to enforce but not defend certain provisions of the DOMA. Sometimes Presidents will use veto power or signing statements to question the Constitutional validity of certain laws but thats not relevant to marijuana possession. ,UIUC,cowas4y,1,t5_2qkxs

The class is consisted of  reading assignments  assessments along with each reading assignments  timed quiz and  small project every week. The  reading assignments are more or less heres the code and heres what the code does. From that the assessments can be done with ctrlf through the document you are supposed to read. The quiz is about knowing the arguments of a particular function you are supposed to learn that week and being able to construct the function call given a particular scenario. Lastly the weekly project is not bad. It is a good application to the particular function you learn that week and at the same time uses knowledge from previous weeks. My only problem about the projects is there is not a lot of flexibility in the way you can code the assignments. Most of the problems in a project can be solved in  lines using a function call and some numpy processing on it.

4756198,0,t1_ctu1x1e,From the courts decision.C. First Amendment Count ICount I in Dr. Salaitas Complaint alleges that certainDefendants violated his First Amendment free speech rights inviolation of  . In order to state a First Amendmentretaliation claim Dr. Salaita must allege fact showing that his speech was constitutionally protected  he hassuffered a deprivation likely to deter free speech and his speech was at least a motivating factor in the employersaction. Massey v. Johnson  F.d   th Cir.. For the purposes of this claim it does not matterwhether the Universitys action is characterized as firing Dr.Salaita or simply not hiring him failure to hire is enough toconstitute a deprivation under the second element. SeeGeorge v. Walker  F.d   th Cir. . Dr.Salaita alleges that the Board and individual DefendantsRobert Easter the University President Christephe PierreVice President and Chancellor Wise either fired or refusedto hire him because of the content of his tweets.The Universitys Motion does not dispute that Dr.Salaitas speech was constitutionally protected or that hesuffered a deprivation in the form of either being fired ornot hired. Instead the University argues first that Dr.Salaita has not pleaded facts that implicate the specificDefendants named in Count I. The University also argues thatDr. Salaita was not fired because of his constitutionallyprotected speech and that even if he was the Universitysinterest in providing a safe and disruptionfree learningenvironment outweighs Dr. Salaitas free speech interest underthe balancing test in Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.  U.S.  .. Claims Against the Individual DefendantsAs to the Universitys first argument an individualcannot be held liable in a   action unless he caused orparticipated in an alleged constitutional deprivation.WolfeLillie v. Sonquist  F.d   th Cir. .This is the personal responsibility requirement and anofficial satisfies the personal responsibilityrequirement . . . if the conduct causing the constitutionaldeprivation occurs at her direction or with her knowledge andconsent. Smith v. Rowe  F.d   th Cir. internal quotation marks omitted. Put another way thedefendant must know about the conduct and facilitate itapprove it condone it or turn a blind eye. Gentry v.Duckworth  F.d   th Cir.  internalquotation marks omitted.  The University argues that Dr. Salaita has not stated aclaim against the individual Board members because they actedwithin the scope of their statutory mandate when they met todiscuss Dr. Salaitas candidacy and when they ultimately votedagainst his appointment. Defs. Mem. ECF No.  at .This argument ignores the other allegations in the Complaintand reasonable inferences drawn from those allegations. TheBoard did not meet to discuss Dr. Salaitas candidacy untilafter the inflammatory tweets and it singled only him out foran individual vote despite summarily affirming otherprofessors who do not appear to have made any inflammatorytweets. Viewed in Dr. Salaitas favor these facts make itplausible that the Board acted specifically because itdisagreed with Dr. Salaitas political speech. And althoughthe Board may have met and voted in accord with statutoryrequirements that alone cannot immunize it from allliability. If the Universitys argument is correct theBoards members would never be liable under    no matterhow egregious the constitutional violation  as long as theyacted within their statutory authority. The Court thereforefinds that the Complaint states a claim against the individualBoard Defendants. The University also argues that Dr. Salaita has failed tostate a claim against President Easter Vice President Pierreor Chancellor Wise. As for Chancellor Wise the Complaintcontains more than enough allegations to state a claim againsther and the Universitys arguments go more to the merits thanthe sufficiency of the complaint. Although Chancellor Wisemight ultimately win on the merits the Court must view theallegations in Dr. Salaitas favor and those allegationsstate that Chancellor Wise fired or failed to hire Dr. Salaitabecause she and various donors disagreed with his politicalspeech. These facts demonstrate that Chancellor Wisefacilitated approved and condoned the conduct that led toDr. Salaitas deprivation which is enough to state a claim.See id.The allegations against President Easter and VicePresident Pierre however are not as abundant. The onlyallegations in the Complaint that relate to President Easterconcern his attendance at a July   meeting where theBoard and the other individual Defendants decided to fire orat least not hire Dr. Salaita. As to Vice President Pierrethe only allegations against him demonstrate that he was alsoat the July  meeting and that he joined Chancellor Wise insending the letter that informed Dr. Salaita he was fired or at least not being hired. These allegations are sparseindeed but they are just enough to raise a plausibleinference that President Easter and Vice President Pierrecondoned or at least turned a blind eye toward the decisionto fire Dr. Salaita because of his political views and speech.See id.. Sufficiency of Dr. Salaitas First Amendment ClaimThe Universitys second argument is that its action wasnot motivated by the content or viewpoint of Dr. Salaitastweets and that even if it was its interest in providing adisruptionfree learning environment outweighs Dr. Salaitasfree speech interest under the balancing test in Pickering.The first part of the argument is premature summary judgmentor trial will reveal the Universitys actual motivation butthe facts viewed in Dr. Salaitas favor amply support a claimthat the University fired Dr. Salaita because of disagreementwith his point of view. The Universitys attempt to draw aline between the profanity and incivility in Dr. Salaitastweets and the views those tweets presented is unavailing theSupreme Court did not draw such a line when it found CohensFuck the Draft jacket protected by the First Amendment.Cohen v. California  U.S.   . The tweetscontents were certainly a matter of public concern and the topic of IsraeliPalestinian relations often brings passionateemotions to the surface. Under these circumstances it wouldbe nearly impossible to separate the tone of tweets on thisissue with the content and views they express. And theSupreme Court has warned of the dangers inherent in punishingpublic speech on public matters because of the particularwords or tone of the speech. See id. We cannot indulgethe facile assumption that one can forbid particular wordswithout also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideasin the process. At the motion to dismiss stage the Courtsimply cannot find that the University was not at allmotivated by the content of Dr. Salaitas tweets.The University next argues that the Court should applythe balancing test in Pickering and find that under no set offacts could Dr. Salaita prove that his First Amendment rightswere violated. This argument is also premature. Normallyapplication of the Pickering balancing test will be possibleonly after the parties have had an opportunity to conduct somediscovery. Gustafson v. Jones  F.d   th Cir.. Of course there are some cases where a plaintiff haspled herself out of court but those are rare casesindeed. Klug v. Chi. Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs.  F.d  th Cir. . The cases in which it is clear at the motion to dismiss stage that a First Amendment claim iscertain to fail usually involve speech that is not on a matterof public concern or speech that is not protected at all.See e.g. id. at  In the context of this complaintthe association seems much more devoted to petty officepolitics than to matters of public concern. Chi. Sch.Reform Bd. of Trs. v. Substance Inc.  F.Supp.d  N.D. Ill.  Defendants possessed no First Amendmentright to publish copyrighted tests.. This is not one ofthose rare cases because Dr. Salaitas has alleged facts thatplausibly demonstrate he was fired because of the content ofhis political speech in a public forum. In other words Dr.Salaitas tweets implicate every central concern of theFirst Amendment. Burson v.

5780175,1,t1_cxdjept,Whether its a product of poor word choice or of the complexity of the term you still seem to be offering a confusing definition. Are you saying that intersectionality attempts to understand how people identify with multiple oppressed or oppressing groups how those people are treated within a group due to their multiplyoppressed status how they should be treated to eliminate or more realistically minimize the oppression they face?In any case this doesnt seem relevant to the discussion. Were talking about Asian students vs black students at UIUC. Yes you could break it down into malefemale Asianblack students but I hardly think thats the point.Furthermore and this is I think a somewhat unpopular opinion here but I think many of these ideas are a product of oversensitivity. Id agree with you that no singular oppression exists in a vacuum but thats ultimately analogous to saying people have different opinions. Whenever theres a power majority there will be some opinionsideas that are expressed more in the group proportional to the strength of the power majority. Its not healthy for the group to attempt to eliminate this. Its healthy for the group to expand its understanding and treat as many people with groupcondusive opinionsideas as well as possible. In practice this means reducing oppression which is far too severe a word for what we have on this campus so long as its of minimal cost to each of the identifiable subgroups in the larger group proportional to their power meaning that the most important group to consider when making decisions about the treatment of oppressed groups is actually the most powerful group not the oppressed groups themselves kinda counterintuitive but more phenomenological than numinal.,UIUC,cxdl2rz,0,t5_2qkxs

The program used for homework was terrible and frequently malfunctioned I assume that program has been phased out by this point though. She was impossible to get a hold of as OP said only the TAs respond and they werent particularly helpful. All questions and concerns went through them which basically meant if you had a legitimate problem it would get ignored. In a  minute lecture she almost always let us out with  minutes to spare usually using an excuse about picking her kids up from school. I remember the average on each test was about  and nothing was curved till the end making everything needlessly stressful. I think I got a B in the end but I definitely spent a large amount of time convinced that I was going to fail.

I know you are CS faculty and this is ECE stuff but you seem knowledgeable so I figured I would ask. Im taking your advice and will talk to an ECE adviser eventually.Also I am taking ECE this semester so if I do attempt the  proficiency test should I wait until after I finish ? I feel pretty confident when you describe it as mostly intro to programming and from what I have seen of the programming parts in ECE from watching lectures it is pretty basic so not sure how much having taken  will help. Apart from the assembly. Thats all that I would have to learn from scratch programmingwise.Did anyone else attempt or actually proficiency out of ECE? What is the format of the test? Would looking at old exams and the syllabus be enough to figure out what would be on it? How long did you set aside to prepare for it? I know that one is really subjective. Im just trying to get as much info as possible because if it is mostly C and assembly general programming the time from now till spring semester would be my best opening to study for it to try to prof out.

If you have  minutes to spare pull the flashcards out and go over them. Over time youll start to learn these reactions. Do this ASAP  dont expect to look at the flashcards the night before an exam and expect to do well. . After you learn the reactions do the recommended homework questions from the book. I know that they arent for a grade but doing the recommended homework is absolutely crucial for a good grade in Chem . Memorizing reactions alone will not guarantee a good grade for   problems are key! Knowing a reaction mechanism is useless if you cant apply it on an exam. . Attend office hours regularly either TA or Professor. If you dont understand something you need to ask ASAP. Chem  is one of those classes where each thing builds  if you dont understand the fundamentals youll have a lot of trouble later on in the course. . Read the textbook.  ,UIUC,d0a9t8k,2,t5_2qkxs

6838360,0,t3_49esa4,Pro ambulance Presence Covenant Medical Center and Arrow Carle Foundation Hospital are the two paid private services in the area. Typically run with one ALS and one BLS provider. The two local fire departments Champaign and Urbana also assist at medical calls and are paid but Champaign is BLS and Urbana is ILS so you would have to function within those scopes of practice although you are licensed as a medic. Im not as familiar with Savoy Fire but theyre a paid fire department that I believe hires medics as well. Illini EMS is a BLS nontransport volunteer agency that does eventstandby for large campus events and most sporting events on campus. Call volume is pretty typical of a small urban area.

Not every woman looks pregnant. babies regularly die during labor even in the hospital a baby born without any prenatal care and labor assistance could very easily die they didnt note if this was a term baby or if she delivered a stillborn baby    babies can die in utero and labor not start for several weeks after postpartum hormones can be even worse than pregnancy all of these can combine to make a perfect storm of a woman not being aware or understanding that shes pregnant and then imagine delivering a baby when you werent aware you were pregnantTLDR Based on the limited info in this article there is no way to tell if the baby died of natural causes during a difficult labor or was stillborn.

7029078,0,t3_4bu7vk, Grad environment is what you make it. I work all the time so I dont really make an effort to interact. There are definitely opportunities to do so. Diverse set of people so you wont have problems finding people that share an interest. Not sure what else you are looking for me to say about the people so if you want to clarify Id be happy to elaborate. Im not sure you would get bored youre probably going to be working a bunch. That said Champaign Urbana is not a metropolis and it does not have a lot of things big cities have. Im from a big city but living here really doesnt bother me. Also if you need to get away there are a few big cities that you can make it to for the weekend. It helps to have a car but Amtrak can get you to Chicago inexpensively. It wont be too hard to take your dog with you. Finding housing is the hardest part. I believe you can live at Ashton Woods if you want campus housing. Fairlawn village and Weiner companies have pretty liberal pet policies if you need a place to start. The tenant union can help with this also. Urbana has a great dog park. Renting a house with a fenced in yard will get more expensive. The university has a vet clinic but Ive been much happier at a private clinic in town. There are puppy daycares  Im not a fan of the concept in general so I cannot elaborate. Ive had my dog with me here for five years and other than finding housing everything else has been a breeze. Find time to visit. Preferably before school lets out. Champaign Urbana is fantastic during the summer but it helps to see what its like when everyone is here and all of the facilities are operating. You are the only person that can judge whether this is a good fit so you owe it to yourself to come take a look. If it is not feasible youre only going to be here  years max so its not that much of a commitment. ,UIUC,d1d3lp5,2,t5_2qkxs

7301248,0,t3_4fdwr3,As the Daily Illini reports the student wearing the Native American headdress was dressed as a Cancunbased DJ while the two men dressed in keffiyehs were in fact both of Syrian descent and wanted to celebrate their heritage.So essentially there are a bunch of people whom have assumed racism where it doesnt exist.  If they truly believe this is racist I would love to see them call the two Syrians racist just for wearing clothing from their culture because that appears to be what they think.Although that story might justify on an individual level it does not justify on a systemic level because when people see it they dont know that story. When they see it they see it as a justification for wearing cultural costumes Yousuf says in reference to the men wearing keffiyehs.No Yousuf that is just what you see not what other people see when they view the images of the party.  In Yousufs view if someone sees any picture of another person wearing a cultural costume at a party whether that person  represents that culture or not they are spreading systemic racism. Apparently Yousuf thinks people wont bother with learning the full story of who and why they are wearing such costumes and assume anyone wearing a cultural costume at a party is automatically a racist. Unlike Yousuf though Im pretty sure most people in this world dont automatically assume racism when they see a picture of someone in cultural clothing at a party and would rather spend their time combating actual racism.The demands NJAP want are insane and wont happen.  Hopefully the people in the cultural garb specifically the ones in keffiyehs speak out more and defend their decisions for wearing their own cultures clothing at a party lest theyre going to be punished when they did nothing wrong.,UIUC,d283p0b,19,t5_2qkxs

The challenge you face is the end of the semester. Depending on your department you may end up needing to come back to campus over the summer or early Fall semester.You should have someone in charge of the appeals in your department.

Dont even think about taking Spanish unless its your passion.As for Chemistry and Physics it really depends. You say you hate chemistry so it might be worth using the credit. The only reason I could think to take it is to boost your GPA since you know the material although it would suck if that backfired.Assuming you pass the physics exams Im not sure what you want to do there.

I know that the idea of saving  a month now sounds appealing but you would not believe how often people couldnt get their cars out because they rented half of their parking space to someone random who they never saw and they never moved their car... plus cars get scraped there a lot so you may want to rethink making it more difficult for yourself.

8837138,0,t3_514twq,Maybe not  what youre looking for but this is from an earlier postOkay so the one line answer between Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics is ME is more focused on Manufacturing and Design while EM is oriented towards Theory and Research. So that comes from ME students taking multiple classes that are heavily project based where they design and build a mechanism to do some function for example a mechanical battery that takes in a certain amount of energy from a motor stores energy via a spring gravity etc. and then returns as much of that energy as possible. This specific project was done last fall in ME  Mechanical Design I. ME students also take a Design for Manufacturability course ME  that looks at the different processes for manufactory metal and plastic parts and how to design a component so it can be made and assembled well. That course also has a large project associated with it. EM students on the other hand really only take one project oriented class TAM  which is Engineering Design Principles. The class varies widely depending on the professor and really isnt considered one of the core EM classes.So thats the Manufacturing and Design side stuff. The reason EM is more Theory and Research oriented is because of the level TAM classes and the extra Math we take.Sidebar TAM stands for Theoretical and Applied Mechanics which was one of the first engineering departments formed back in the late s and existed up until around  years ago when it was combined with the Mechanical Engineering Department to form the Mechanical Science and Engineering Department or MechSE Department. The TAM graduate degree still remains but the undergraduate degree became Engineering Mechanics.The xx TAM classes Computational Mechanics Continuum Mechanics and Intermediate Dynamics are very theoretical. These classes also serve as an introduction for many Masters students so they are very high level and generally pretty difficult. For this reason EM is considered harder than ME and can hurt your GPA a bit because you are competing against not only other undergraduate EM students but Masters students as well. In addition to these upper level TAM classes we also take the full Differential Equations course MATH  and Intro to Partial Differential Equations MATH  while ME students take Intro to Differential Equations MATH  and Statistics. So what does this amount to? Basically if you choose to go to grad school you could not be more prepared than with an EM degree. By the time you graduate you will have taken at least  courses that have many Masters students in them and in some there are more grads than undergrads.The core of the two programs are similar as well as both have to take a Fluids Thermodynamics Materials and Dynamics course. There are smaller details between the TAM and ME core courses and if you want to know more details we can talk in person.Summing up If you want to go into industry go into Mechanical Engineering. If you want to go to grad school look at Engineering Mechanics. But just like many of our Mechanical Engineering graduates go on to grad school many Engineering Mechanics graduates go into industry. So thats the difference between EM and ME.,UIUC,d7a3l2x,1,t5_2qkxs

Maybe a shorter survey.    Maybe a token reward for completing it but a way to check no answer if you have a problem with a question.      Perhaps randomly assign each person to see only  of the questions to keep the length down for each person.

9026763,0,t1_d7w6pu7,The worry here isnt statistical significance its systematic errorsdifferences.    E.g. differences in how questions are asked tendency of people not to report events nonrandom selection of participants etc.    Thats why all agencies have problems getting a firm figure.    Its much easier to get accurate numbers for events that have to be reported.   E.g. its hard to avoid reporting a death because you need to bury them etc.    Injuries serious enough to demand medical attention also tend to show up in records.    But if you arent hurt and the situation is embarrassing its easy to see why you might just walk away from it.    Think about how many minor bike accidents arent reported even when it might have been a good idea to say get checked out at McKinley.    How many grading mistakes or bad TAs have you just walked away from?    The reporting failure that sticks in my mind is a whole department of faculty at another place who didnt report a buzzing light fixture in their main seminar room for most of a term.    It was fixed a couple days after I finally reported it for them.    This is way less embarrassing than being drunk at a frat party but they still didnt make the call.Even when the original event is reported there are major issues rolling up data from individual towns hospitals etc to central databases.    Thats why we have two major newspapers trying to track fatal police shootings from trawling newspapers and not quite picking up the same list of dead people.     When the data are this uncertain a good approach is to take measures that will tend to reduce the rate even if you arent quite sure what the rate is.    E.g. get problems reported so the university andor police can lean on the folks responsible so they dont do it again.   ,UIUC,d7wviiv,8,t5_2qkxs

9707027,0,t3_5e429i,Articles like this always make me a little nervous since I think the bar system we have here is perfect for all parties. It gives students somewhere to go and lessens the chance of any physical harm or property damage that usually happen at private parties. Also makes things easier to monitor for police who can more readily help students and need and not have incidents go unreported since the bar is more reliable for calling stuff in than friends at an apartment that fear getting in trouble. The University also benefits from this same logic very rarely do we hear of serious injuries or deaths as a result of drinking as bars will usually prevent someone from getting to that point of intoxication at least one would hope. The only issue is the leniency with the  age limit and the underage drinking that will happen regardless but I do think its for the greater good and I hope all parties see how much safer it makes students with this setup.TLDR Students always have a place to go University and Police can prevent incidents more easily when most are out at bars rather than private parties,UIUC,da9lkz1,14,t5_2qkxs

However there have been unique cases where a TA has been added after the beginning of the semester.As far as TA recruitment unless a department has a specific applicationexpression of interest process or they go by seniority it is usually word of mouth.  Future profs will ask previous profs to put forward names of students who did well etc.Given how strapped every department is for tuition waiver granting positions unless you hit a beautiful and unique snowflake situation rare but it happens that department is going to prefer their own crew over an outsider.You should talk to one of your advisors or the person who handles the paperwork and such for those in your area who do get waiver granting appointments.  Also confirm that the people youve seen get TAs are in fact getting waiver granting appointments and not just a grad houly position.,UIUC,dco3zhr,2,t5_2qkxs

10508260,0,t3_5qflg0,gt Id like to transfer into CS.I strongly recommend applying to CS programs at other universities in addition to pursuing an oncampus transfer.The CS department cannot guarantee classroom space for prospective transfer students especially in classes like  that are required for multiple majors. Even if you manage to get into all the necessary classes you have to score within the top  of each class to even be considered for a transfer. Even if you manage that meeting the minimum transfer requirements does not guarantee that you will be admitted to the major.This is not a statement about your qualifications your passion for the subject or your likelihood of thriving in the major. As much as we wish we could the CS department cannot admit every highly qualified passionate student who would thrive. We dont have the faculty we dont have the staff and we dont have the physical classroom space to keep up with demand.We. Are. Full.gt What can I do at this moment?Nothing that you arent already doing. is full. There are dozens if not hundreds of other students like you who are still trying to add the class. Unless the instructors have given you some indication that you will get in you probably wont.gt I am really tired of this shit and feel desperate.So are we and so do we.,UIUC,dcz80rq,19,t5_2qkxs

Just google OR logical operator Thats a poor attempt to backpedal your admission that they turn to violence when they dont get their way. Even if they only choose violence in  of cases that is  in  people who support suicide bombings. And as you can see in the Pew research I linked above its far greater more like  of the relevant populaces that believe suicide bombings are justifiable.gtIn response to how terrorism could be one of the scenarios listed lets assume a scenario where you have no food Ive killed your wife and your  year old daughter and you now have to support your sick son. A terrorist group offers you some money in exchange for taking care of your son. Tells you to go bomb a building. You have no other way to provide for your sick kid. You go blow up the building. You get killed. They nurture your kid brainwash him and raise him as a terrorist. This isnt made up btw. Its extremely exceedingly common. Youre making my point for me. If terrorism is extremely common then how exactly do you propose to filter out the terrorists from the people who really lost their wife and  year old daughter? Anyone can claim to have those exact hardships. They could be telling the truth or they could be a terrorist. Or maybe they are a terrorist because the group has already kidnapped their kid and theyre being blackmailed such that the only way to get their family back is to commit terrorism here in the USA.The best thing we can do for people in those countries is send aid establish safe zones andor help to eliminate the terrorist groups. Allowing large numbers of people from those countries to enter our country just spreads the problem from their geographical area to our geographical area. No thank you.gtI wont argue any further cos I looked at your comment history and I have much better work to do in my very nice and busy life.Excuses. You wont argue further because of the facts regarding violence in those countries. Importing large numbers of people from violent countries will spread the violence here.

The only time I have seen mention of courses is if you are doing a summary of a study abroad experience. There the course load might be unique and present the value added from the abroad experience.

That will lead to even higher profits.Not having money to pay for their stock also implies they should raise their prices. Since they are a newer business they are probably way on the left end of the economies of scale and it would be more efficient for them if they sold less output at a higher cost until they got themselves figured out.Underestimating demand before opening is not uncommon but now that they have been open they should be able to ballpark their daytoday demand a bit better. ,UIUC,ddcjsve,-3,t5_2qkxs

Yes theres idiots who use it for other reasons and I dont care. Theyre wrong theyve always been wrong but dont take away a thing that helps people because some people are idiots. Narcissists coopt whatever they touch and taking away their toy doesnt hurt them theyll just find something else it hurts the people who actually need it.

11099672,0,t1_deq35oe,Thats not true in the slightest. Im saying the University can do what they want Unofficial isnt going anywhere fast. Instead of wasting time money and energy fighting it we should be focusing on other things. Personally I did not receive a single email about saferesponsible drinking. I received one packet of info that was from an RSO. The university should not be attempting to squash drinking  its not going to prevent it but it will make students more wary about contacting authorities when a problem arises. My point is the University should be focusing on making Unofficial safer not about stopping it. Plaster info about safe drinking anywhere they can.
