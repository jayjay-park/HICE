8293990,0,t3_4srbal,Im guessing its your CPU. Too much thermal paste or not enough thermal paste. That would be my first guess. Download Intel Extreme Tuning Utility and run a cpu stress test while monitoring the cpu temps. If that isnt the issue run a gpu stress test and monitor temps. Hope you get it fixed man.,EVGA,d5eb3gs,1,t5_2vvbj

11757621,0,t3_66pg3v,Does anyone have a photo of their hybrid cooler installed along with the original Founders Edition backplate? Im considering one of these for the new  Titan Xp.The inatructions in the manual online are lacking details.
