9197724,0,t1_d8hv0rv,Wow. The part about Shadows mother adds a lot of clarity to something that I felt had significance but could never really figure out. I feel like I would have enjoyed the book so much more if I had a better knowledge of mythology.,HalifaxBookClub,d8hvnif,1,t5_3fjp1
11432065,0,t1_dfoj563,Yeah wholly unlike anything else Ive read by Marquez. To be honest Im somewhat disappointed because Im really fond of the style in One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera. Im even struggling to finish it myself and Im the one who suggested it  how embarrassing. To top it off my kobo keeps acting up and losing my page and its really REALLY hard to figure out where I left off when there are no clear delineations anywhere. The sentences go on for pages there are hardly any chapter breaks or even paragraph breaks the plot is labyrinthine and out of order and to top it all off there are tons of repeating motifs e.g. in a denim uniform with no insignia and a single spur on one heel or however that goes. Ive probably reread almost as many pages as Ive read just trying to find where I left off. Gosh. Sorry for the rant but suffice to say I empathize completely.,HalifaxBookClub,dfrt9r1,1,t5_3fjp1
