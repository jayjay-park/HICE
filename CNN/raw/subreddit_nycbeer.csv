4245947,0,t1_cs3l1zt,Barrier is really is an excellent recommendation especially for someone who will be staying relatively close to there.OH is kinda far comparatively but if OP is taking LIRR into Atlantic Terminal it really isnt all that bad. Theres other good beer related stuff near OH anyways. OP if you plan to make a day out of going to OH Id also consider making time for Threes Brewery. There are several excellent beer bars in that general area too Bar Great Harry Owl Farm and Double Windsor. Double Windsor has good food while BGH and Owl Farm dont but the later  allow takeout to be brought indelivered and have a myriad of options around them.,nycbeer,cs488pc,3,t5_2t2vk

6133287,0,t1_cyms4nq,So before I show up and get embarrassed and stand around for a few minutes before leaving before it starts...let me ask one more question. I dont have any sort of beer cellar because I live in a one bedroom apartment and nothing I buy lasts longer than a month. But I do hit up local releases from time to time Other Half Barrier among others. Would those be OK to bring or are we looking for next level stuff?,nycbeer,cymsgqm,1,t5_2t2vk
