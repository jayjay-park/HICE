Our gut feel is that his power is specific to the immediate situation and creates a non violent short lived compulsion to comply.Once the subject has complied the power stops affecting them. So he cant tell someone to go and get something and give it to him he is limited to actual physical possessions a person is carrying at the time he gives the order. So Give me that gun would create a compulsion to literally hand over the gun. In game mechanic terms... should I be letting victims resist via defence rolls should I see him use a social roll could I vary the strength of the compulsion based on some factors like distance to target etc. ,Weaverdice,d9r0me5,1,t5_342au

I also remembered a breakertrump that had like ten different breaker states that they could choose from as well. Not really trainwreck as he built a permanent suit and well he actually built something. My guy just makes a scarecrow body that can rearrange itself into various devices.,Weaverdice,dfljzz4,1,t5_342au
