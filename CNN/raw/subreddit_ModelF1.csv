4534877,0,t1_ct28hkh, Its a sort of F sim run through Reddit. We all form teams based on current F teams. We pick drivers this has already happened then set up our cars for every race. The races are simulated every weekend we earn points and then we can adjust our strategy for the next race.  To take part go to this thread and say I would like to join Manor. Then youll be allowed to post in rMFmanor and will become part of our team. You can choose which role you want in our team  mechanic communications whatever you like. You can pretty much invent a role and make it your own. I guess you could join another team but that would be silly. ,ModelF1,ct2959n,1,t5_38j8r
