That said there are other Warrior type jobs such as Knight and Dark Knight DK comes in three days.  The starter job you have Onion Knight has lite versions of the classes that are similar so you can get a feel of them as you rank it up. So you can play Warrior as Onion Knight its just a tad more generalized and gets a different weapon as you rank up that any Warrior class can use so not wasted if you dont get the class you want for awhile.,MobiusFF,d6clpkp,1,t5_3ffqe

8643835,0,t3_4y98pm, Yes. Figure out a good auto setup and let it farm. I havent gotten nearly that high. Using hunter so overkill isnt much of an option. Those are the best if youre going for score. But they arent necessarily the best overall. It depends on if youre going for high score or viability in difficult situations. Some of the highest scores are taking lots of really weak enemies to the point of death and then hitting them with a critical strike as hard as possible with their weakness.Im mainly using hunter which has low magic and an ultimate which is lots of little attacks on a single target. Not going to get number  score but it has speed and critical strike. The randomness keeps things interesting and always makes you question your decision. Play defensively or gamble on a good critical strike to break the enemy? Keeps it interesting.  Other people say its  so I trust them! Cone attacks add a level to strategy. Fun to figure out placement and in what order to take out enemies while weakening the ones around them. Using two jobs at once. More choices makes things more interesting.,MobiusFF,d6m393n,2,t5_3ffqe

8691843,0,t1_d6s30dr,Set one of each card as a favorite. Once you have enough Gil fuse it with similar cards to max the ability level. Either sell the rest or save them for when you augment it to a two star ability. But fuse them all before you augment to three star. When that happens it will lose the lesser and become a regular ability which cant fuse with one and two star abilities for ability levels. Sell the rest.The quickest way to level skills is to get the monster version to level  and use that first. It will be missing a  passive attribute bonus and one unlockable ability boss monster cards are not missing the unlockable ability but that wont matter right away. It will have the same damage and number of seeds although they might be different types from the store version.If you want the best version right away buy the store version for  tickets and gather two ability level  cards and  ability level  cards to fuse. Use the ability level  cards during levels  and  of the upgrade along with enough level s each level for .So you can stop leveling the monster ability at level  if you want to go straight for the store version but you will have to farm a lot longer to get that one to level   cards total instead of .The level  monster will then go in your bank to wait for the eventual level  and  store upgrades. Each of these requires one level  and four level  monster cards.,MobiusFF,d6s3xvz,2,t5_3ffqe

As players we need to adjust our expectations and look to the Japanese version as a preview of the possibilities and not look at it as fact. That said we will probably be able to upgrade them sometime later. The data for the cards is available and it wouldnt make sense for them to not bring it out in the future. The cap is likely due to how early they released multiplayer.

8909900,0,t3_52ayk4,First the question you might not know to ask did you pull Black Mage from the six ticket   magicite summon pool or are you asking about the one that Apprentice Mage levels up into? If its the second one the answer to your question is pretty straightforward no its terrible pull something else when you can. If its the first one there are a few stages though Id read this too since Im going to repeat some of it First BLM is perfectly fine right now. Its the quintessential mage damage dealer in multiplayer and its a bit fragile in single player but puts out ridiculous damage. As I understand it falls off later on based on current JP content whereas WHM gets a lot better but by that point you can pull for a better mage when there are better mages.As BLM mostly follow that except for the following you dont care about the fire trio of ability cards Kirin  Belias  Ifrita because you cant use them at all and you do care about the earth trio Goblin King  Ark uh...guyface with Stonega? Idk. P These are the two elements for mage that arent currently farmable though so youll want to trend towards Max Fenrir and Sylph first since thats yknow possible. This will change in a week when we will become able to farm chocobos to level Kirin but you still dont care about Kirin. Just FYI in case you pull WHM or RDM.Supportwise Fat Chocobo Moogle one of Cait Sith if you want big spiky heals or Hades. Cait is probably better now but he falls off hard later as I understand. Yuna would replace him but I dont think new players get her anymore. If you can do Pupus and feel like it you can max out Gusion pretty easily and use him to spam Sylph at every earth boss that blinks at you wrong but its not at all required.Personal opinion time that you can feel free to ignore the first four cards Id max would be Fenrir and Famfrit  Sylph and Maduin. Theyre really easy to farm all the way up and Fenrir is great right now because he melts Ifrit the first multiplayer boss.

The speed difference is pretty important in single player so I think Black Mage edges out Mage slightly there. However in multiplayer the speed difference is less important and Mage offers slightly higher magicwater bonus damage as well as the fire element drive against Ifrit elemental advantage against Shiva.  If you want to play the mage classes I believe theyre both worth maxing out eventually to have good element coverage in multiplayer.

This gives your breaker something to do if the Attackers havent gotten the orbs they need. Then attack a couple times. This generates orbs for everyone including you.Turn  Drive Earth and Fire. If the enemy has a full red bar use Moogle. If not wait.Turn  Heres where you start to evaluate. Is the enemy bar at full red? If no use Fafnir again. If yes use Moogle. If its broken itll have a number on the left side of the bar. If its at  use as many Fafnir as you can and lock in first. You can start the chain going for the Attackers so they do more damage. If its at  youre looking to use Fat Chocobo. Go last use and then attack a few times. This generates orbs for the Attackers to break with at the start of the next round and starts to replenish your own. Rinse repeat.Reminders all support cards have a minor heal attached to them. But if anyone falls below k its time to heal. Remember to use your stamps for this. And check decks before you Ready up. Itll tell you if somebody came with a heal equipped so if they fall low and you see a pink skill in their bar you can skip healing yourself. Youre going to make mistakes. Thats okay.

9089921,0,t3_54ryo0,In general you want to use abilities on the yellow bar normal attacks on the red bar and abilities on broken enemies. As long as the ability isnt resisted it will probably do more damage than a regular attack to a broken foe. Even with an assassins lackluster magic a maxed Ifrit will hit reasonably hard.Yellow bar damage is based on a cards break stat and the characters magic. Red bar damage is based on the characters break stat. Damage against broken enemies is based on attack for normal attacks or card attack and magic for abilities.There are situations where you wont want to just spam abilities and use normal attacks instead but these are the basic mechanics.,MobiusFF,d84gmub,1,t5_3ffqe

9299024,0,t1_d8upbh0,Mage and Black Mage are just different elements really but the classes play much the same. For single player youll probably notice the Mages lower speed stat  vs  at max panels but other than that theyre both roughly equally great at whatever they have elements for.While Mage has a tiny bit lower Magic than Black Mage he pretty much makes up for it by having a bigger bonus to Water damage from his panels. This makes Mage the natural choice for WaterFire bosses  he can drive defensively and exploit boths weakness and does as good damage against Fire bosses as Black Mage who cant drive defensively does. Similarly Black Mage is the logical choice for WindEarth.Build for Attackers is usually main nukeAampT Moogle or a PupuEither a force or shift cardflex spot which is often a spell that is better at breaking the bar mandatory for VampF users. Since I dont play Attacker myself only been drawing Supports so far... except the Dark Knight I just drew which Im kind of meh on leveling I cant say for sure if having two Support cards is always wrong but its an okay start. Check what other Attackers are bringing.

It then hits it again with the AoE portion for whatever the AoE does. ? ?Its doing more than twice the damage in a single action. Fafnir wins only in the orb cost. It did its two attacks for  fewer orbs. .At  stars Undine costs  so more single target damage in  action than fafnir did in .

Assuming you can drive the element of the boss in question that is always awkward with Knights on Shiva Warriors on Odin etc.If youre not interested in being a Defender in Multiplayer then Taunts dont matter awfully much.

With  it has a  turn cooldown so you will always have one hasteless turn in MP where you dont generate more turns because of the delay between losing the buff and reapplying.Immortals HasteSnipeDrain duration is . This means that as long as you cast it off cooldown at  Haste will never fall off and you will always generate the maximum turns.Oh also Immortals passives are Life Orb Starter and Increased Life Orb generation guaranteeing you one life orb off the bat and helping you draw more.This with both the synergy of KotR buff coverage and drawing  orbs being very hard to judgetime unless you have perfect information of your allies orb states meaning its not necessarily fully useful is what makes AampT fall off a bit though it still has its place.,MobiusFF,d9sz7g1,6,t5_3ffqe

The difference is that these new set of cards not only does  hits they also have extremely high atk n break power weaknesscritdef down debuff which makes this cards extremely strong fighting enemies with weakness. As for orb cost for  orbs for  version which is quite the improvement compared to the old card which needed  orbs even at  and has no additional effects.Edit u could wait till the last day before the banner changes n decide if u wanna do some pulls.

9684475,0,t1_da6taib,Sure I mean a dedicated card performs way better than hybrid solutions however our current rating and understanding come from the idea that most encounters are against relatively small number of enemies. As we have seen in recent additions the number of enemies in a given stage is going up including multiple bigger or boss type enemies.

9726524,0,t1_daby963,Its not really that they are trying to mislead us or lie to us.They just suck at English andor communication in general since it seemed like the Korean and Chinese announcement said the same thing. Remember FFRK? They never said that we could augment the cards. They never said we couldnt augment them either. They didnt foresee the assumptions the playerbase would make and so they dropped the ball on that by not being clear. They say certain things but they dont say certain things. The way they word the announcement certainly makes it sound like theres no other way to get Tidus but they never explicitly state it.They tell us things likegtHermes Susanoo and Nekomata will continue to be Early Acquisition Cards.When they announced the nd batch of early acquisition cards Hermes batch they didnt say anything about AlexanderCarbuncleGlasya going into the ability shop. They also didnt say anything about the st batch staying early acquisition. Because there was no mention many people assumed the st batch would be in the ability shop. This did not happen. But now they decided to announce that the Hermes batch will stay early acquisition to clear up the possible misunderstanding. gtIn additoin anyone who buy  and more magicite in total will receive the Legend Job Ace Striker!gtDuring the event period everyone who purchases  and more magicite will receive the Legend Job Ace Striker!Is this the only way? They dont say. If it were the only way wouldnt it be better to say Only players who purchase  or more magicite will receive the Legend Job Ace Striker?Maybe thats what they meant. Maybe they didnt foresee the possible confusion. Maybe they didnt foresee the possible backlash. Maybe their English and communication skills sucks balls.

9783789,0,t1_daj18pg,So. I love Red Mage hes a lot of fun to play. Hes extremely glassy with pitiful HP and next to no defense mechanisms but he has otherwise solid stats great overall damage and an amazing ultimate.His problem in single player is that hes generally considered too fragile for stuff like Tower events  although with that said there were Red Mages at gt  kills in the last Tower and I used mine to   and that he has no real specialization. As an example he shares elements with Thief but Thief does way more Earth damage than Red Mage. Red Mage beats him in Fire and Wind damage but once you start having a lot of jobs youd rather use one Fire specialist one Earth specialist and one Wind specialist rather than an allrounder.For multiplayer hes extremely squishy as a Healer his gargantuan Magic stat the highest in the game by far! goes to waste and his ultimate is not supporty at all although it still does great damage. However his huge Fire resistance actually means hes the tankiest of the Healers vs. Ifrit so I used him there and rather enjoyed it. Id wager that has changed now though with White Mages custom panels probably making him far more attractive even on Ifrit.Its not all doom and gloom however. I do most of my single player stuff as Red Mage because boy does he kill stuff fast. Haste Artemis and two damage spells gt anything anything at all will be turned to mincemeat. He cant auto tought content with the same impunity as the heal drive jobs but he does clear a lot faster.His weapon is really great too  especially for White Mage maybe ironically  and more importantly Red Mage is next in line to get his custom panels which I hope are amazing or at least completelyoutthere weird and cool. So I have hope for the future.Also he has tights. Yeah.,MobiusFF,daj2d2s,3,t5_3ffqe

My deck consists of Ifrit Sic Paine Susanoo YRPI rent a card with FaithI use Ifrit Sic because Dragoon gets a large increase to fire abilities and I fight on the Warriors Demise water node.  Basically on the last wave I get one of the boss mobs halfway to break then I use my ultimate with Bersek and YRP up.  That gets me just over  million alone.  Then I proceed to break the other as normal.  Once broken I cast faith debuff with Paine then Ifrit Sic for the deathblow for another  million or so.I figured with a little luck in the earlier waves i could top  mil.

As for your warrior deck sadly the most useful cards are taunt cards for MP. As for SP the sicarius cards are what you just need.    For Scholar its about the same with warrior. Hes a defender in MP and is also a mage so he has a lot of magic stat. So he is your best bet if you need to score higher or for farming.    For now its still best if you augment support cards then onto  ones.

Combined with Guard Breaker it also let me deal with Water bosses without a care in the world which was great.As for Vitality Tap it surely did help burning down enemies although Im not quite sure how much it does yet research ongoing may be as much as !. I unlocked it towards the end and I was killing the bosses of the final floors with relative ease which might be partially thanks to it.At Ability Level  Bismarck has  Attack and  Break Power. Incidentally thats the same Attack per orb spent as Siegfried and way less Break Power.I think Siegfried would have done better really although its not a world of difference. I ended up playing as much as I could to Bismarcks strengths so rather than complain about the low Break Power I did as much damage as I could before break and basic attacks with Pupu on actually provided a very relevant damage source so it worked out I suppose.

10245362,0,t1_dc53yh8,I find it strange to commit a  magicite purchase when you dont know much about this game. This isnt your normal cash grab game. There are tons of strategies and techniques in this game. You might be overwhelmed or feel lost for a few weeks. I suggested that you spent nothing right now and just slowly collect your magicite. Spent these few days to evaluate whether you really love this game or not. If you really do and want to support the game spent money after  Jan  to buy  magicite to buy your first Mobius Box. And by the end of the month you feel good about this game just go ahead and grab another  magicite and earn your complementary Legend job. TLDR only buy magicite when you know what are you going to spend it on. Otherwise you will be like a  year old that has  in the pocket. Buying all the wrong things. ,MobiusFF,dc5da3z,3,t5_3ffqe

But the basic idea seems to be that theres an extra panel which you can fit various stats and bonuses into including some very powerful ones from the socalled Hall of Fame. Examples include White Mage starting matches with three Life orbs guaranteed Knight taking  less damage every time theyre hit and so on.Red Mages were basically Heres a bit of extra damage. Not too much though wouldnt want to make you viable or anything. And forget about being a Healer in multiplayer except were still not making you an Attacker either.

Im FP and I own exactly  event cards. Honestly the debrave isnt as bad as you are making it sound. It lasts up to three rounds Ive never ever seen a Thanatos in MP so far and not every game I play has a defender with taunts. Curse on the other hand is in nearly every game so I swapped it.Lightnings break damage per orb is pretty much exactly on par with the siccarius cards... plus its AOE which is a great deal. It allows me to drive while I would normally work on yellow of the second guard. Absolutely no point in bringing a sicarius or  ST for faster break in my experience.,MobiusFF,dcbu4ec,1,t5_3ffqe

10315777,0,t1_dccwjk5,Apart from letting you bypass the mil upper damage limit which I personally think is irrelevant as even in JP no boss survives one break phases worth of spamming mil abilities multistrike also gives you multiple chances to get at least one crit  which does not increase average damage it just smooths out the values a bit!  and thus can trigger stuff like the Ranger Extra Skill that refunds two orbs on crit more reliably. Theres also a rather strange feature that makes it so that if you use a multistrike ability during the last tick of break all of the multistrike hits will get the break damage bonus but all hits after the first will also affect the enemys yellow gauge which is nice I suppose. This only works in single player though.,MobiusFF,dcdcl9r,2,t5_3ffqe
10318256,0,t1_dcdlheg,Ideal deck would be like IcieLeviathanpixieberserk my main point is STConeAOE cards are all bad. cone being the worse by far.Focus on support cards like force cards and debuffs yashanekohechanteir they will remain usefull for the longest time.maybe my view on MT cards is skewed because i have  Kill and draw and run the corresponding force card and out of a full haste turn I can cast it  times or more which is equal to  cast of a single target card in  action on top of breaking and  doing extra aoe dmg and crazy ultimate  charging cause your spending more orbs.I was not a fan of them until after I finished in the top coulda gone higher but no reason of the last tower by doing this without turtleing and and killing the bosses in  break every timewould not have been possible with ST cardI mean its not better in every conceivable situation then a ST card but for the hardest content and for faster easy content MT cards are well ahead of STAOEConesMost of what im saying is just giving you information to make your own decision  but IMO just spend your SPMP stamina daily and boost weapons and wait for Knights of the round to release and pull for that boostfaithbrave  buff extender extra ability   will be a staple card in SPMP its still in almost every SP deck  in JP and every Support deck in MP and might actually be worth overboosting thats how good it is.,MobiusFF,dcdmp7m,1,t5_3ffqe

10414062,0,t1_dco2ay4,I missed out on the taunts unfortunately. I joined the week they where available and i wasnt ready to spend money on the game yet. Knight was my first job i pulled and i was excited to play him in MP but without taunts that made it difficult so i put him on the shelf for months. I just recently pulled him out to see what I could make work since MP was getting a little boring and repetitive.gt Its more beneficial to let the tank eat two single target punches than the assassin eating one slowstun instead of taunt because of how healing works.I would agree but since taunt isnt available to everyone and it doesnt look like it will be for some time lowering the damage of attacks is the best alternative. With slow and stun you get a lot of breathing room some turns the boss wont even attack so for those who are near death it gives them another round to get out of the danger area. It takes a little more planning and more attention but it is a pretty decent alternative. gt But if you have you should drop a stun for a taunt.I would drop Cinque if my Neko was augmented.

10440812,0,t1_dcriyor,KotR is the abbreviation for Knights of the Round FFVII a new card. Despite the FFVII suffix its a normal card in the sense that it will eventually appear permanently in the Ability Shop although it will probably only be available via card summons for the first onetwo months but afterwards buyable for Ability Tickets.For the price of three Life orbs it offers three turns of Brave Boost and Faith for three turns. This is basically all the buffs you need to hurt something in one place so its awesome for deck compression  for example I run Artemis Boost most of the time and getting both Brave and Faith at the same time is a really sweet deal. The shorter duration and higher Life orb cost is partially offset by most  cards including KotR itself refunding a Life orb on cast and that key cards like Hermes and Fat Chocobo have the Duration Boost extra skill increasing the duration of other buffs already on you including all the buffs from KotR by one turn.I feel like its still a bit too clunky to be an absolute musthave for multiplayer just yet but eventually we will get Lifeshifts that as the name may imply change all your orbs to Life orbs ! and a turn  Lifeshift gt KotR gt all sorts of other buffs sounds like a godly turn .For single player I think its going to be amazing!

10520650,0,t3_5qmsrf,Havent tried him in SP but for MP hes pretty useful. My deck is one BDDElement PupuArtemis. His break isnt the best compared to Assassin but with the help of one or better two or all of the above really makes him hit the enemies easy peasy. Not to mention his tankiness is just dayum haha. With SP though I plan to have him with a good Ranger weapon that has a good breakmagic via weapon boosting. Its not gonna be as high magic as others but itll work since for now hes the only Job to utilize it. ,MobiusFF,dd0mnzr,1,t5_3ffqe

10524727,0,t1_dd10xee,You are absolutely free to disagree and indeed I welcome the feedback! This is kind of the first event of its kind so theres a lot to be said and thought and maybe it fails who knows!. I recognize that there is no way to put players on a perfectly even playing field in a game where even your job pulls are decided by luck. All I can do is identify as many factors as possible that people jump on and say Ah I dont have X this is why I cant get top ! and suggest that they not be used for the challenge. But these are mere suggestions in the end so if you disagree you can absolutely choose which to follow if any at all. Someone mentioned taking inspiration from the Tier Challenges in FFRK which I rather liked the sound of... its something Ill look into given that therell be a next time and Im not ousted from reddit!.As for the last event it was a Bismarck and although I did pull it at  I kind of regret not spending the Growstars that I had available to augment my Siegfried. Shrug! But in any case its a shop card available to anyone and I cant go ahead and ban augmented cards either.In the end I realize there are many flaws with this but maybe something good comes from it. There were those who voiced interest in it and plenty who voice contempt and thats fine! Ill be happy as long as we see at least a few fresh builds in top .,MobiusFF,dd13brs,1,t5_3ffqe

If Yasha leaves Early Acquisition during the event that would make my life a lot easier!Theres also the unfortunate fact that Red Mage just isnt going to be that great at nuking Gilgamesh without an ult spam build and I dont have enough experience with ult spam to predict the results so well see if I can get him to work for me!

10558853,0,t1_dd4agp2,gt If I can use Carbuncle for  months then it is a very decent deal to augment it.Absolutely not. Carbuncle gains next to nothing from augmentation since spamming him for healing only marginally increases the healing output and you typically dont use him enough times to notice the Life orb refund. Immunity to Poison is almost never relevant save for Guard A shenanigans and deck levels just dont matter enough to burn Growstars. Duration Boost is useless in mulitplayer since it doesnt affect teammates and Carbuncle is next to worthless in single player where Duration Boost would actually shine.tldr Dont waste Growstars on Carbie unless youre a whale who swims in them.,MobiusFF,dd4yrg2,1,t5_3ffqe

10694147,0,t1_ddiyxoc,The jobs you have Ranger amp Assassin does not have Light amp Dark elements.  The cards for this FF Remark event is cater for Light amp Dark elements jobs.  Question you want to be asking is do you want to summon this round of cards hold them in your inventory till you summon for a job that can use Dark amp Light elements?By the time you do have a job for that new events may have pop out with better cards.  Remember you cant escape power creep with ongoing gaming.  Cards that are useful now usually gets phase out by more powerful cards down the road.Having said that it also doesnt mean for you to not do anything and wait for the future content future cards.  Because that will literally mean you never get anything or worst not really playing the game. Just be mindful of what you do and what you use your tickets and growstar on.  Especially growstar.. its the most precious thing you hang your dear life to on MFF.  So use it very wisely.So back to your question i cant tell you for sure if you should summon for this FF event.  Who knows your next job to be a Viking or Devout or Paladin and you curse at me for advising you not to?  Again who knows you thank me for life if i advise you not to because after  jobs draw you still have not gotten any with Dark or Light seeds? As a week old player?  Heres my advice keep your summon tickets.  They are the next most precious thing after growstar.  Jobs for now should be your priority and the target is to have at least  jobs that has been max to the th panel.  This would allow you diversity and options.  Once you have at least  jobs then you can consider pulling for event cards.  This is unless with the exception of exceptionally great event cards then of course since its time limited.

10811170,0,t1_dduz53y,Samurai is a very special job! In fact he can be called the most unique job we currently have.First his weak points He has ridiculously low HP although he gets good Earth Resistance as he levels up and he has extremely low Magic which means that he does super low ability damage all abilities use Magic even Warrior abilities!. This means that against a lot of enemies he will struggle to break and kill them since he cant remove their yellow gauge quickly and he cant do a lot of damage when theyre broken. And when the enemies do hit back theyll do a lot of damage to him.This might make it sound like Samurai does no damage but thats actually entirely untrue  Samurai is considered as the highestdamage job in the game! There is a simple reason for this His ultimate Iai Strike is the hardesthitting ultimate in the game. Samurais Attack stat is ridiculous and although it doesnt affect his abilities both his normal attacks and his ultimate scales with Attack so he can easily punch stuff to death with normal attacks and even kill lategame bosses from full health to zero with a single ultimate.Unfortunately this is not very easy to do for new players. Ultimates get a lot stronger amp faster to charge as you level up but until then Samurai is basically just a squishy lowdamage blob. Hes probably one of the worst jobs for a beginner unfortunately. You can definitely manage but consider whether you want to look for another job for now  Samurai will be great later but not so much now.,MobiusFF,ddv3gjf,3,t5_3ffqe

Jobs like Mage for example will heal basically nothing with Drain.At any rate if the fight does go long then Haste uptime is far more valuable than the healing Drain provides and again Wedge has dreadful Haste uptime.

11016003,0,t1_degmf6e,Hermes is a solid choice! So that seems good. I would not recommend Alexander as hes a very niche card and is terrible outside of this niche. Artemis is definitely strong but doesnt really require augmentation.Bahamut Titan and Ixion are all quite strong but Titan and Ixion can currently be farmed in the FF Remake event from the appropriately named ShinRa Soldier squads in the event. So Id go for those first. I wouldnt MAX Boost anything at all ever  most things can be farmed either now or soon and if you do decide that you want to skip farming you can always use tickets to max out your cards anyways by going to Fusion gt tick Boost Fusion. This has the exact same total cost as MAX Boost nothing lost. So MAX Boost is kind of a pointless feature.But again always farm instead of boosting tickets are precious! There will be cards further down the line that never get farmable fodder  e.g. Knights of Round  so youll have to save quite a few tickets to max out those.You do not need to do anything to your Hermes before augmenting you can always augment cards regardless of their current ability level and the ability level will get carried over to the augmented version as will unlocked Skillseeds Extra Skills and Fractal AutoAbilities. No worries!The only reason to delay augmentation is for the Sicarius cards from multiplayer they become more expensive to level up if you augment them. But for most cards including Hermes this doesnt happen so no worries.,MobiusFF,degmsst,1,t5_3ffqe

I dont know myself since Im the poor sot who cant get aerith. anyway TLDR deathgaze mateus aerith aerith. or the normal people with mediocre luck deck deathgaze mateus artemis some st card zidane if you have it.every game start with either mateus or deathgaze to bring all enemys yellow to red. try to break as many as you can before turn end you can skip water enemy since assassin has good water resist. then have fun killing them before they move. at later chapter if you cant break the enemy before your turn end you are most probably dead. that is why assassin sux with auto farming.unless you are super serious with assassin else its best to just pull for another job. its just  summon tix. its not expensive.

11205691,0,t1_df24kch,Lightnings AoE is amazing. As I mentioned above it takes out guards and the boss in  turns without breaking.  Zidane also worked decently well. Critical rupture makes a huge difference here since you are not breaking. Kills the boss in about  casts with CRD.  Cloud is the weakest of the bunch since it doesnt have any special perks. As you said theres also a lack of good earth attackers.,MobiusFF,df25fyw,2,t5_3ffqe

11238957,0,t3_60ecvv,gt Scholar sports one of the highest Attack Break Damage and HP values in the game for the Mage class.Im afraid thats not quite true. His HP is admittedly high  although beaten by Devout and soon by Occultist  but his Attack is mediocre beaten by White Mage and Red Mage and his Break Power is aggressively mediocre only barely higher than White Mages much lower than Red Mages Devouts and soon Occultists. Theres also the note that since his ultimate does virtually no HP damage his Attack is almost irrelevant.Scholars main problem is generally how mediocre he is. His kit indicates he should be an antiWater specialist  Water resistance Fire damage bonus  but both these bonuses are far lower than White Mages  and  vs.  and  and in other matchups he just doesnt have anything thatd make him shine. His ultimate while good at breaking is also arguably a lot worse than say Dragoons.I cant honestly say Ive had any reason to run Scholar since Tonberry Tower and even then I only ran him on the trice node  I used White Mage on all the other nodes because it was way easier to run White Mage vs. Tonberry King than running Scholar vs. Tonberry King. World of difference  Heal Drives matter much less than youd think.On the bright side Scholar is passableish for  Odin. Power Drive Wind  does help.

11446682,0,t1_dftc0ea,Thats definitely not correct.  You might end up with   equips but youll always have a five star.  Heres the full statsgtAt price point . CAD vs. . CAD you spend  more for nearly double the chances and one of those is guaranteed to be a  or higher. Plus the premium currency is given at about  or so a month meaning you get . pulls a month to budget with. And thats before any giveaways they do each month they throw us another  or so. Theres also only one type of pull to do so you dont need to worry about splitting between jobs and events like here.gtAt value GASs do give an OK rate on  but then require some extra work to get it to . And thats for generics  For characterbased rares those seem to be at about  from what I saw others posting. And in these games its usually Event characterbased cards that allow someone to excel at content  This is one argument Ive been learning to concede you dont need these gacha cards to play most of the game but as someone who enjoys optimization and clearing things handily it definitely preys on that part. Both of these games do of course but its a matter of the extent.gtFor additional drops RK doesnt practice supremes or legend jobs in the same sense. There might be a chase item per banner and thats usually at  of each of the  pulls so you can end up with  of the chase item in a single pull sometimes. Also multiplies have a greater value with combiningreforging allowing you to power up the weapon.,MobiusFF,dftgzc4,1,t5_3ffqe

11456582,0,t3_63e50n,Hmm... interesting thoughts.I was gonna White Mage withHermesCarbunkleFat ChocoboAlexanderI figured even though Alexander is considered bad that using it can prevent a one shot kill for those classes that cant draw an element or are squishy.  I just love  orb cards with Quick Cast and Extra Life because you dont rely on a large number of tap attacks.I tend to only cast  support card a round.  I just rotate through them.  When I do  card support I save using two for the times I need a little bit of extra burst.  With that and the constant healing of Carbunkle my defenders rarely need to drive heal for  star battles.Im just worried that bringing  support cards and something like Ashura might not be enough.Instead of Alexander I do have a maxed out KOTR and Cindy.  I have thought about the Regalia just to up my chances for  starting Life Orbs and the ability to get some extra turns to generate orbs for everyone.  Im not sure if the extra turns affect everyone else.Do people really think that  support cards is enough?  Am I just used to overcompensating for people by wanting extra support?  I kinda feel that my damage isnt quite as important as long as nobody dies.,MobiusFF,dfulg4j,1,t5_3ffqe

11507976,0,t1_dg09p8w,Small background on me. I started playing during the FF collab event. While this event was ongoing the FF collab went ahead as well which gave me free pulls for two weeks and it gave me Titan which is a good card warrior type earth AOE BDD for one of the jobs I pulled.Some general tips some RNG involved. BUY A MOBIUS BOX FOR YOUR FIRST  MAGICITE. If you dont have either save your Magicite and buy one when you get .. Make sure to pull for a job and hope you get something you would want. I got lucky and got a Knight for my second job pull which is great because I wanted a warrior class card.. Get an AOE BDDCRD card in the class and element for the job you pulled and max it. I got lucky and managed to farm all the fodder I needed to get my Titan from  Alvl  to  Alvl  during the FF event. Because hat event os already over get ready to fork over some ability tickets.. Go to Multiplayer and get a sicarius card for another element for your pulled job and max it. Unlike Ability Shop cards they get their Break Damage Limit ability at Alvl  instead of Alvl . This is easy since you can get carried up to  MP fights even with a suboptimal loadout.. Get two supports. Hermes Haste will probably stay evergreen so pick him up and max him first. The other is up to you really.All in all the above will take at least a month and a half or two months because growstars are very rare unless you have a surplus of cash or growstars.,MobiusFF,dg0fi83,1,t5_3ffqe

Regen  Use it early to have Regen for the whole fight for taking extra damage for only one turn.

11650619,0,t1_dggko6g,Exactly. Thats why I typed guarantee in quotes. P People seem to keep forgetting that you dont need a guaranteed  orbs first turn if youre using Aerith in MP. Even without any source of Life Orb Starter or Prismatic Starter. The game is designed to have support in MP start with at the least  heart orbs. So you only need to make up the difference. Having  guaranteed orbs seems to be the sweet spot.As far as double Aerith goes. I certainly dont think its optimal. But its also not a waste of a slot. Since it still provides Ultimate Charger Quicken and EsunaHoly Cleansing. Along with still being a pretty good heal albeit an expensive one in regards to its HP to Orbs ratio.,MobiusFF,dggm16x,1,t5_3ffqe

Palamecia is basically one layer of insanity after another WoL ran out of fucks to give before he ever arrived and Echo is a albeit fairly annoying sadist who understands both sides well enough to be the only one who really understands just how annoyed WoL is an she loves it.Seriously.
