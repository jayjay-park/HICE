5664765,0,t1_cwz7yco,Well duh. Of course Nintendo are playing it safe because theyve got little clue what else to do. Thats why they almost didnt greenlight even Splatoon  despite the fact it too sticks closely to Nintendos standard colorful shallow party fun formular. Yeah so heres a small golf clap kudos for daring anything at all that deviates even gradually from their current failsafe formula simply by daring to for once not employ those  year old CG templates chiseled into Nintendos massive granite stone tablet stylesheets. thumbsup ,casualnintendo,cwz9pap,0,t5_2uz4o

10228894,0,t1_dc3fwnn,Thank you so much. Im currently  been studying arts in college for  years now. Before that I painted doodled you name it for most of my life actually. My art style is slightly more cartoonist Ive found over the years so Ive stuck with that. I would love a career in painting if it was sustainable but it definitely isnt so Id probably end up working for a company HOPEFULLY a game development studio because I love video games and always have ideas in that sector. In terms of resources not many but my best friend has been occasionally buying paintings from me so thats helped sustain my supplies a bit. ,casualnintendo,dc3i3fr,1,t5_2uz4o
