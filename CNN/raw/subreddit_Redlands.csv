Look for the white bicycle on the side of the road.  Maybe youd have a different perspective if you spent some time in the LLU ER department like I have so that you can have an opportunity to see some of the results of your fantastic place to live.  Im not inventing the crime that happens in Redlands.  You just are another ignorant moron who has to have something happen to himself to finally get it.   But youll be moaning and crying for pain killers just like the rest of them in the ER when your time comes wondering why it happened to you when you thought the area was so nice.  You probably still think it cant happen to you.  Chances are good that your luck will run out before you leave this world.  Crime is steadily getting worse in Redlands.  Compton Inglewood and South Central were nice places to live once.  They didnt become crimeridden overnight.  San Bernardino was a safe family friendly place too in the s and s.,Redlands,d7gkevk,0,t5_2s5d6
