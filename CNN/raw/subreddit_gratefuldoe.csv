2836272,0,t3_2sifeo,These were my very last two Dead shows after following them on the east coast since the mids. They were also the worst performances I had ever seen from the band. Jerry was hurting  bad. He didnt move. He stood at the microphone with his head down and stayed there. His guitar was turned down because his playing was so bad. His singing was atrocious and he didnt get through a single song without screwing up the lyrics. These shows were not good memories for Grateful Dead fans. It was clear the end of the road was near.

2920490,0,t1_co02ay7,Yes I saw that. The problem is that the Reverend Horton Heat has a website listing all of his past tour dates. It does not list .So that brought the setlist.FM listing into question. From that point it was a matter of figuring out exactly who was there that night. If the Reverend wasnt there was Babes in Toyland? Was White Zombie?

4799354,0,t1_ctzehti,There has to be a record somewhere seeing as you need a permit to run a group home and theres zoning laws etc. However it is likely that it will be really annoying and bureaucracyladen to access those records. Maybe the local housing authority or social services are good starting points. However social services will be very wary of inquiries due to the nature of their work.Who knows maybe you passed by JCD on the street or even interacted with him...EDIT If he was in a group home maybe he stole the pendant from another resident.

4975404,0,t1_culoazz,Good points.I think he died elsewhere. gtSome livor mortis is noted on the lower posterior trunk and buttocks area.I believe that indicates he was lying on his back at death or shortly after death.

I thought nobody would notice the post !I really wanted to study the subject before doing conjectures especially since Im not a local. I knew a few things about them beforehand but I guessed that in the same fashion that all the people we cram under the same denomination of native americans arent of the same culture denomination in the same life conditions and such there should be a lot of internal variations when it came to amish populations. And I have no idea how it is for the one near Beloit. I was told that they were like only  though.

7203017,0,t1_d1wor6y,He was transferred to an acute care facility today where they are supposed to help him transition from needing intensive care to being able to participate in rehab. Apparently its extremely difficult to predict the recovery time for brain injuries so all we can do is wait and support him and hope for the best. Whatever happens recovery time for brain injuries can take anywhere from six months to several years. Ive just been kind of railing at the universe  hes already survived a stroke rehab hes nearly  years sober three knee surgeries and a back surgery. He was doing really well over the past few months and then just fell out of nowhere.  Its possible he can make a full recovery which is what were hoping for but its also possible that hes going to require constant care for the rest of his life. Thank you for asking. lt,gratefuldoe,d1wxbxo,1,t5_35oxl
7317574,0,t3_4feuof,Im feeling pretty fucking depressed about the world lately. In the past few days I learned that the Pacific Northwest a region I have always wanted to move to is going to be destroyed by a magnitude  to  earthquake eventually and theres a  chance of it happening in the next  years. And I also learned that koalas one of my favorite animals might go extinct by  due to habitat destruction and chlamydia. AND I just read possibly the most faithinhumanitydestroying article ever warning extremely depressing Plus my usual constant worry about global climate change and my life being basically a series of ways for me to distract myself from thinking about my own eventual mortality which really doesnt help me with getting ahead in actual life.I wish I was more certain about the possibility of a God or afterlife. I sort of believe in the existence of the soul after death partially due to Grateful Doe actually among other things but obviously its not like anyone can absolutely say for sure.IDK dudes like how do you guys live life without getting consumed by all this depressing shit?

Toombs that passed away in  in Chicago. Dona Toombs was a known alias of Dona Thompson.  According to the Social Security Death Index Dona L. Toombs was born September  . While I cant find Dona Lee Thompsons birthdate NAMUS says shed be  today... Meaning she was probably born in .  The weird thing for me is I couldnt find any birth records for Dona Thompson Dona Toombs or Dona Bezk on Ancestry. Usually thats pretty easy especially for someone born in the midtwentieth century.In addition to the ages fitting Toombs SSN was issued in NJ while Thompson was from NJ according to her NAMUS page. There are also probate court records in Cook County dating from  that show Toombs was the subject of a PET. FOR GUARDIANSHIP OF DISABLED PERSON case thats probably of interest for anyone trying to confirm her identity.
