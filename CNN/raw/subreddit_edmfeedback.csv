7772311,0,t3_4iu5q8,You have some really cool sounds and it reminds me of Joyryde. The drop sounds pretty unique which I like a lot. I would add something extra to the second drop and also the chiptune sounding synth sounds a little out of tune compared to the bassline. The production is pretty clean as well. Great job! ,edmfeedback,d3pndpo,1,t5_2tfep

11390938,0,t1_df3y75f,Thanks for your feedback. I get your point and think youre right. In my other tracks i was always trying to build up to this massive drop but since i didnt have one this time i thought i try with less buildup but maybe that wasnt a good idea... DThx again amp enjoy mate!,edmfeedback,dfn58n6,2,t5_2tfep
