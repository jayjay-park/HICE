10092088,0,t1_dbhwjoa,For me this works to my advantage I can hold down the button for an automatic gun then still be able to look around and adjust aim. Try looking and shooting on right side walking and aim on left side still three fingers but one on the right and two on the left works well for sniping and auto guns I recommend static joystick and no sprint button  sensitivity at least if ur on a phone,bulletforce,dbn0k5s,1,t5_39uws
