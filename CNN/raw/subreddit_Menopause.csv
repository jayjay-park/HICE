3053345,0,t3_2qdjxp,May I ask  did your periods occur earlier or later than normal before you started skipping them or were they still on schedule?   I am  and had regular periods until a couple months ago. Then I had the worst breast pain and swollen breasts you can imagine. It lasted for two weeks and then my period was over a week late which never happens. I freaked out thinking I was pregnant as that is the only time my breasts have ever felt like that. I tested and was not. Then got my period as usual but now they have gone from every  days to . And breasts are fine  no pain at all. I honestly felt pregnant. Does anyone else feel that way? ,Menopause,coeh6sq,1,t5_2scp5

I made a post here a few months ago menopause from the husbands view. I didnt think my marriage would survive. It was bad. Maybe not with you and yours. ,Menopause,cqpi5oq,1,t5_2scp5

8535849,0,t1_d668tud,Youre right it is a very dark place and Ive sucked the people I love into it as well. I feel exactly the same way and until like I had mentioned my aunt telling me that all my symptoms sound exactly like perimenopause as shes been through it I had no idea what was happening. I just thought I was too young to be going through this already. Since I posted this Ive spoken to several others whove either been through this before or men whos wives have been through it. Everyone has been so supportive and it has helped immensely! I see my obgyn in  days so hopefully I will get treatment then because I dont want to live through another month of this not only for myself but for those I love as well as being able to function better at work as thats not been an easy task for the past several months now. I have read everything Ive come across on the subject so I have been more educated on this because I literally thought I was going crazy. Im just glad I now know what it is and what I can do to fix it because the person I am now I dont like at all. I miss who I used to be and want to be my normal happy self again. ,Menopause,d68jpz9,1,t5_2scp5

10189815,0,t1_dbz1su5,It has to be so frustrating to not have the numbers match what you know is going on. Thats actually a fear of mine Ill be going to the doctor next week in fact. Finally have an appointment with one  I moved a bit the last few years so its been awhile. But I know my body and my family history. So happy to have found this sub at least. The feeling of being alone and fear of it all is a lit to take in. ,Menopause,dbz2luc,2,t5_2scp5

11506475,0,t1_dg037q2,Im trying my best...theres no guarantee this is it its just so like my morning sickness that I feel like it has to be the beginning. I was so looking forward to it because I loathe getting my period. I didnt think of what other side effects there really were. Im trying meditation medication anything that will help. But again I dont know this is it for sure. But something tells me it is. I want to be gentle with myself but honestly its like Im in a different body and mind in the mornings when its worst. Im so scared by it.,Menopause,dg09d88,1,t5_2scp5
