3298409,0,t1_cp4815e,Understood! For the most part my hubby is cool with whatever I choose to do but he really is afraid Ill mess my face up like Meg Ryan and he is also afraid that it becomes a slippery slope Botox today  facelift tomorrow  then a tummy tuck  and so on.,30PlusSkinCare,cp48u15,2,t5_379gw

3553612,0,t1_cpx9mbg,Please keep an eye on it though. If at all possible keep makeup off of it too while it heals.  And I have even had the bandages help reduce the cysts for some reason. You just dont want it getting infected.All that said are these typical for you? Have you been able to figure out if there is a trigger?,30PlusSkinCare,cpxc322,1,t5_379gw
3629512,0,t3_31xekc,RetinA RetinA Micro etc. have been the default recommendations to me for wrinkles. Youll need a prescription for them. My mother got Botox for a long deep wrinkle between her eyebrows a frown line and she loved the results. ,30PlusSkinCare,cq5zqat,1,t5_379gw

4111944,0,t1_crowtoj,I second checking out rAsianBeauty. Since dullness and wrinkles are a concern it sounds like perhaps you should up the moisturizing with water like hyaluronic acid serums and sheet masks and oil.  Moisturizing a lot will plump up skin and give it a sheen which will reduce the appearance of wrinkles and add a glow.  Your PocketDerm doctor can advise you on incorporating AHAs.  Mine said to not incorporate it until my skin got used to the tret.  You can also start off with something gentler that you could use every other day lower than  glycolic or try lactic acid or mandelic acid which are supposed to be gentler.  As for vitamin C different skins react differently to different forms of vitamin C.  You could try ascorbic acid which is in the popular OST C and C serums and seems to produce good results for a lot of people.  Ive used OST C and personally didnt think it was as transformative for me.And one more thing check out brightening products which are available in a lot of Asian beauty products with ingredients such as niacinamide licorice arbutin kojic acid and tranexamic acid that will help with dullness. I know you already have vitamin C and niacinamide in your PocketDerm but you can definitely layer additional products with those same ingredients and also use them during the day.,30PlusSkinCare,crozjo9,6,t5_379gw
4404575,0,t3_39d469,The best product that requires least maintenance would be RetinA.  hands down the best antieverything aging.  Add a great moisturizer and you are good to go.  ,30PlusSkinCare,csm4pii,1,t5_379gw
4497235,0,t1_csqlh4f,Ive heard this works and will try it but I used to get these before I was married and didnt have a ring.,30PlusSkinCare,csxj6m2,1,t5_379gw
5179236,0,t3_3lwr1j,Quickest and most permanent thing is CO laser resurfacing. It takes  years off permanently reduces pore size wrinkles fades some sun spots. I did it in February and it was amazing. I am  and I have been carded for alcohol  or  times since I had it done. I also have good genes but spent much of my life outside so far horses swimming hiking etc.. I plan on having it done every couple years. Also use retinol. For the CO resurfacing there are Groupons for it pretty frequently for  face and neck at least in my area.,30PlusSkinCare,cvaad9d,9,t5_379gw
5186026,0,t1_cvaad9d,That is way out of the price range I can see myself spending on a treatment. I could afford it I suppose but Im way more likely to spend that on climbing trips at this point! Maybe in the future Ill feel differently though thanks for the reply,30PlusSkinCare,cvb3ulx,2,t5_379gw

7282708,0,t1_d25y8s2,If I plan on spending more than  minutes outside I apply sunscreen. However you need to factor in travel time as well if you drive to work during the day. If Im not going anywhere then no I usually dont apply sunscreen.,30PlusSkinCare,d25zun5,1,t5_379gw
7497217,0,t3_4eorz2,Could the bumps be millia? I just learned what those are recently on rSkincareAddiction. Theres a helpful article on the Paulas Choice website about how to treat them here,30PlusSkinCare,d2ue7sb,1,t5_379gw
7621676,0,t3_4jmcex,Ive tried a few drugstore eye creams and none of them did the trick for me. Some Olay products seemed okay at first then suddenly made my undereye bags appear extra purple! My favorite that Ive been using for most of the last  or  years now is Lushs Enchanted Eye Cream. Somehow each . oz bottle lasts me about half a year x daily application.,30PlusSkinCare,d38jm7s,1,t5_379gw
7641639,0,t1_d3a04u4,Oh and for hair I cowash conditioner only once or twice a week.  I have thick wavy hair though.  I think this method works best for those with course wavy andor curly hair.  ,30PlusSkinCare,d3at8wn,1,t5_379gw

10584408,0,t1_dd7o5uf,In general as we age skin becomes more thin has less fat and therefore becomes more dehydrated more easily. I dont know that that is necessarily whats happening in your case although I do feel like my skin has become more dry over the past couple years Im a couple years older than you. So perhaps it is your skin changing but since it seems sudden and is happening all over I feel like it might be more something internal like diet and water intake. And maybe the winter. ,30PlusSkinCare,dd7p7ul,2,t5_379gw
11355570,0,t3_621djt,Definitely stop putting any substances on there immediately especially chemicals such as hydrating serums. I recommend you go see a dermatologist.,30PlusSkinCare,dfj4soo,7,t5_379gw
