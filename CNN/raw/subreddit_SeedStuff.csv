3036218,0,t1_cocihwd,Okay I got it working. It was my fault  I did include the  in the server field I didnt suspect this was the issue since it didnt work with just the IP on its own.Thanks for getting me to persist! It works perfectly and is something Ive been looking for for ages .EDIT Now I just have to figure out how to get it automatically open torrents from my goto trackers page so I dont have to rightclick and select the add to webui option every time...DOUBLE EDIT ....and I figured out how to get .torrent files to be added automatically when downloaded from my tracker. Today has been a great success.,SeedStuff,cocpbwm,1,t5_31k4t
