4190330,0,t3_38rspo,Things I suggest .  I would greatly prefer no DST or Kickers. They really are just irrelevant in a dynasty format. .  the rules say waiverFAAB then later say that it is determined by WL ratio. Since those contradict each other I would urge to just use the budget to auction waiver players. It is the most fair and everyone gets the shot at players. Losing teams already get early draft picks that is a big thing. .  The one other dynasty league I am in uses a Taxi Squad this is a feature on MFL. The taxi squad allows you to roster up to  rookie or second year players. Those players can not be put in you weekly rosters unless they are promoted to your main team. Once a player is promoted they can not be put back on the taxi squad. This allows you to carry some young developmental players. Which is really the main draw to a dynasty league. It also increase base roster sizes in our case to  but does so in a way that is a little more manageable.,FF_Dynasty,crxwb4z,1,t5_35nl5
