11723469,0,t1_dgme31r,Hey thanks for sharing your thoughts.  Ive just created a place for feedback on this matter I see your point about them generating more discussion than selfposts.  So far weve not had a ton of posts here.  Im trying to avoid making an LSC clone but I think ultimately it should be up to the community.  If you have any more feedback I am all ears and would love to hear it.Thanks!,CapitalismInDecay,dgovvwl,1,t5_3jq6b
