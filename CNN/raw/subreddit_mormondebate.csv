911208,0,t1_ch7ujyo,I think thats kind of a stretch but lets go ahead and accept it.  All things are not done with common consent.  Does that mean this church is in apostasy? Here are some examples  Lamanite change  temple change  temple change  DampC change removal of the lectures on faith from the DampC all talks given in general conference any business interest of the religion any claim by the LDS newsroom and nearly everything on LDS.org or Mormon.org. ,mormondebate,ch7uzci,2,t5_2skb4
1079659,0,t3_26b121,exmormonThis is the way I always understood it.  God wants us to become Gods.   Problem is when I become a God I am going to have similar power to God.   So what?  Well if I am equal in power to God I could destroy God.  I could destroy all the other Gods.  I could destroy the universe and all possible universes.  I could torture forever every intelligence.  So... God wants me to become like him but he needs to trust me with that power  before he gives it away.  Satan could always influence men to do evil.  In the premortal existence this was possible.  In the premortal life I COULD influence others to do evil.  When we were all just spirits we couldnt really suffer.  We may have had the desire to do evil or we may have little integrity and others could very influence us to ALSO have those desires.  But despite our will we couldnt really do anything that would cause harm to others or even our self.  In the spirit world a Satan like being posses no real threat.  He cant causes suffering.  In the premortal existence God was able to tell which of his children he could actually trust with his power.   He also knew which of his children he could never trust with his power.   There was however a third group that couldnt currently be trusted with God like powers but if given enough time and experience they could learn and grow and eventually be trusted with Gods power.  So we spent a ton of time learning things in heaven and developing our characters.   Earth is simply another experience God wanted to put us through to help us develop our characters.   The purpose of earth life is to see how we would behave without any understanding of eternal consequences.  To see how we act in the moment.  Now not everyone needed this experience.  Jesus for example could have just become God right away.  There were others as well that didnt need an earth life to earn Gods trust for celestial power.  But you and I definitely dont fit into that category.  Satan and other evil spirits will always have the ability to influence you to do evil.  They did before you were born they do on this earth and they will after this life as well.  However you have just as much power to influence others to do evil save the fact that you are confined to one body.   But when you get to heaven or the spirit world you too could take on a satanic role and try to convince others to do evil.  Hell when you become a God you will still be tempted by Satan or spirits like Satan.  Just look at God.  He presented a plan and Satan came to him an alternate plan.  Satan was tempting God with a different plan.  Satan is simply ONE spirit one person that tries to tempt you to act in way that will make you less than eligible to receive God like powers.  ,mormondebate,chr0dlw,2,t5_2skb4

2085553,0,t1_cl4wbkn,First clearly from what you say it is wrong to assume that the existence of hallucinations proves that sight isnt real correct? Second the results would appear to be the determining feature between an hallucination vs. sight. If I see something say a keyboard and type on it there is touch and text appears on the screen if I was hallucinating the keyboard the other sensory results would not be present or would dissipate when the hallucination ends. Likewise if after having a spiritual experience I do what the experience implies or alternatively just look at the average result of those that have had such an experience than I should be able to determine whether there are any real effects from following the experience. Obviously this isnt quite as straightforward as typing on a keyboard and it could especially for one who has not had any such experience with the promised Holy Spirit be debatable as to the causation of the correlation and what effects are caused by the experience vs. other effects but the point remains as the Alma reference states by observing the effects you can know whether it is real and good or not. ,mormondebate,cl4x452,1,t5_2skb4

4584107,0,t1_ct8e6m4,Dont read too much tone into my posts.  I am trying to understand your core assumptions.Correct me if I am wrong but I think you are assuming that uniquely mormon scripture is not true that Joseph Smith was not a prophet of god but that the bible is true.  Thus your perspective could be described as nonmormon Christian.A devoted mormon can easily dismiss everything you have said on the grounds that you are using scriptures that have been superceded by more accurate scriptures.  An atheist can easily dismiss everything that you have said on the grounds that the bible is full of fairy tales.  Given that a lot of people here are either mormon or exmormon atheist I wonder whether there is a more Christianfriendly subreddit where you might get the positive response that you are expecting?,mormondebate,ct8fesw,3,t5_2skb4

6789403,0,t1_d0luve2,gt Does your belief structure account for the fact that the advanced beings may be of the same species as us?That depends on when these advanced beings arrived at our planet.  It is possible they may have witnessed the formation of our solar system and even been the source of life on our planet.  It is also possible they didnt arrive till relatively recently long after intelligent life evolved on our planet.  If MormonChristian myth texts have a basis in fact these beings dont seem to have had a direct interaction with our species until relatively recently within the past  years.  They may have been shaping our evolution before that though and they may have directly colonized our planet.  For example the Garden of EdenGenesis myth may even have been based upon such a colonization effort.  I think if there are advanced beings here and it was ever an established fact I would be highly interested in finding out how long they have been here and when they started interfering with us.,mormondebate,d0lv817,3,t5_2skb4
6797049,0,t1_d0lv817,Yeah...youre not getting it.  Imagine the human species but evolved over Billions of years from now.  Those people would likely be called and considered Gods based on our current understanding.  That is exactly what mormonism teaches.  That there is a race of highly evolved and over time perfected beings which have become allpowerful allknowing that direct the universe.  We call those beings Gods.  Now imagine two of those highly evolved and perfected beings appeared to Joseph Smith.  You want to call them aliens.  I want to know why you have trouble calling them God?  ,mormondebate,d0mqjdx,2,t5_2skb4
11480386,0,t1_dfuk3ac,Thank you for this excellent responseI think you have argued the informed faithful LDS position just about as well as it may be argued.  I will present my argument in detail part  and then use it to respond to your points part .part  of  A. LGBTQIA individuals are generally better off in this life accepting their conditionYou wrotegt If you dont believe that spirits have gender that we came to this Earth with those eternal genders and that well leave with them then you are absolutely right. Pigeonholing those born with physically ambiguous traits is very unproductive and perhaps even harmful.A. To engage in productive activities is better than unproductive activities.  Hence the neutral case its very unproductive to pigeonhole these individuals into a particular gender is inferior to working to understand and accept the real gender complexities these individuals face.  These individualsand the societies to which they belongwould generally be better off spending their time and energy understanding via scientific or psychological investigation and then altering or accepting according to scientific models of wellbeing and flourishing rather than merely pigeonholing.  Pidgeonholing is the least nuanced possibility for many intersex transgender or homosexual individuals who may be better served with nuance.Hence in the absence of a contradicting worldview an LGBTQIA individual is best served by appreciating the nuance of their situation and not pigeonholing them wholly into one gender or another to avoid harm and unproductive activity. B. It is not exalting if it runs counter to our desirable biological natureB. There is nothing intrinsically undesirable about being LGBTQIA especially if procreative issues can be circumvented so that these individuals may procreate if they so choose i.e. in vitro fertilazation sperm or egg donors etc.Ba. From what Ive read on the topic most homosexuals do not desire to be anything other than homosexual outside dogmatic religious environments.Bb. From what Ive read on the topic most transgender people do not regret their decision to transition even if the transition itself doesnt tend to solve other underlying psychological issues alone.Bc. From what Ive read on the topic many most? intersex individuals wish their parents had not surgically imposed one particular gender or another upon them.B. The primary reason we find LDS doctrinal concepts on the family exalting and beautiful is because they take the best of our natural situation i.e. family life amplify it and extend it eternally.B. To insist that we will eternally become something contrary to our nature here on earth that is not intrinsically undesirable is not exalting or liberating.Ba.  For instance imagine a religion that teaches we can each become antlike in the eternities.  They might claim that the possibility for each of us to become antlike in nature one day is liberating and exaltingit allows us to overcome our homo sapien nature and experience the true bliss of anthood.  I take it most humans would consider this an affront to their humanity.  They would strongly object to the ant religion.  All things being equal they would prefer a religion that lets them continue to be human in the eternities.Most LGBTQIA individuals are okay with their biological nature.  To impose an eternal worldview upon them where they must be wholly one gender or another is to impose upon them a worldview that runs counter to their biological nature and hence is not exalting or liberating to most of them. C. Allowance for LGBTQIA spirits is possible in the LDS worldviewC. It is not outside the realm of possibility within LDS thought that peoplespirits have been or will be intersex or have characteristics of both genders in the eternities.Ca. That same sociality that exists among us here will exist among us there.Cb. LDS doctrine typically holds that animals will be resurrected.  However numerous animals show fluid gender and sex throughout their lives  Will an animal that was born male so presumably had a male spirit but became female during its life be a female in the eternities?Cc. The family proclamation should not be called revelation  Hence it is possible that LDS scripture on the topic is merely stating the common case and the exceptions to the rule have not yet been revealed.Cd. God is capable of bending what we view as fixed rules of lifedeath and morality.  For instance according to LDS thought God impregnated Mary to produce Jesus sex outside of marriage  incest.  In the OT he commanded capital punishment for women who had committed adultery i.e. he was okay to condemn an innocent fetus to death to ensure the punishment of the adulteress.Ce. Do we even know how spirit children are created? this assumes that Orson Pratts book The Seer is considered speculative and not doctrinal.  With infinite power what is to prevent LGBTQIA individuals from procreating through some alternative arrangement I can imagine several possibilities see Ca?Cf. Why wouldnt spirits map closely onto a future biological body?  Presumably a spirit has personality.  How can that spirit even approximate the personality of an intersex or transgender person without also approximating the mix of gender characteristics they possess biologically think about how much of a persons brain functions in a sexually dimorphic way.  Of what spirit gender was someone with complete AIS?  Male or female?  If female why would God put a spiritually female body into a genetically male body?  If male why would God put a spiritually male body into a body that is female in brain function sexual desire and all outward appearance?  What about those with partial AIS?  Mild AIS?  All these issues are solved once we accept the possibility within LDS thought that a spirit is a close onetoone mapping of a persons biological mind including sexually dimorphic characteristics.If LDS doctrine made provision that an LGBTQIA individual could have had an LGBTQIA spirit and could remain the same in the eternities with all the blessings they desired this would be a superior worldview for these individuals health and wellbeing here on earth.  Given that these possibilities have not been ruled out in LDS thought I argue that the current dogma gender is fully binary in spirit is less healthy for LGBTQIA individuals.edit minor clarifications and punctuation changes stuff like that.end part  or  part  of  in reply to this,mormondebate,dfxark0,1,t5_2skb4
