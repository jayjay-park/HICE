1287789,0,t3_28tjql,This is very similar to my trip this week.  I went out solo to do a  mile loop but my one full day of hiking was nerve wracking due to overgrown trails heat TICKS and a timber cut going on that destroyed a  square mile section of the forest.  By the time I got through each separate piece of this hell on earth it was time for a late lunch.  I was planning on cold tuna and crackers but I couldnt stomach it.  I had a larabar and napped.  Then I pressed on trying to escape this forest as soon as possible by dinner time the terrain turned into a jungle with tons of hills no place to really get comfortable and then a huge rain storm rolled through.  I weathered that and realized that I was even less hungry now.  So I marched on until I found a car campground.  This gave me a picnic table to stay on to avoid ticks.  Finally about pm I felt like I could eat so I cooked up a meal and it actually tasted pretty good.  I was very surprised that my body could hike  miles in a single day and get by on cliff and larabars.  ,WildernessBackpacking,ciehqy5,3,t5_2zmsv

3393815,0,t3_2z2ks9,My advice do your homework and most of these irrational fears should be rationalized away. Learn what kinds of animals actually live in the area youre backpacking. Chances are there arent many that are truly scary and then youll take precautions against the ones that are e.g. using a bear canister. Look into your odds of being murdered by another human in the backcountry. Most people arent going to hike miles from a trailhead to mess with another human and in all my years of camping and backpacking the only even halfway negative interactions Ive ever had with other campers have been drunks in cartent campgrounds. If you feel that you need protection from something carry it legally and ensure that you are properly trained in how to use it. Calling the local ranger station is often going to be your best source of information and they should be able to provide you with enough info to assuage your fears. If you are educated on the area prepared for all likely contingencies and weather and always know and respect your own limits there isnt much left to fear.

3758583,0,t3_33gaf7,Depends on where youre at every country has its own way of doing things.  The below is US specific for the most part.  There is no one stop shop for this.Openstreetmap.org shows backcountry trails using GPS data set the layer to Cycle Map and itll switch to a topo map with trails.Free high quality topo maps of the USA in pdf format can be found at the USGS map portal  Quite often the historic topo maps are better for finding trail data the maps from the  era have excellent trail data.The US Forest Service has an excellent map collection here  Their printed topo maps of individual US forests are of very high quality and well worth the money.  US states have their own outdoor management organizations many of which have good map collections.  For example the Pennsylvania DNR has a web portal here for finding trails in their state forest system.  You have to look on a state by state basis I picked PA because they have one of the best run DNRs in the east no fooling.Local trail and hiking clubs usually have map collections too.  For example in my area the PATC sells trail maps that covers nearly  miles of trails.  Finally loads of information onlinesearch for an area youre interested in.

5868807,0,t3_3v8104,I just spent   hours solo hiking in the dark last night! I went from about pm in Shenandoah and the sun set around .  I obviously think night hiking is a great idea. I was doing it on the AT which I dont recommend as much as on the PCT or out west. Ill tell you why the West is easier for night hikes. Then Ill tell you . The difference between the AT and PCT and night. . what to bring and how to evaluate a lamp . which type of trails to choose and . one generally good point of advice.  .  First is navigation orientation. When its open and vast its easier to see where youre going. If you know  I need to make it to that ridge its way easier than I need to make it past these shallow curves on a map. In my experience on the AT the trees are thicker and the hills less steep so its harder to see where youre going.    Second on he AT its harder to find a campsite in the dark than the PCT. There are more small bushes and scrubs everywhere so out East you have to find to a portion of the woods that opens out and then look for camp. In the desert or high sierras there is open dirt in more areas.     So basically its totally doable but more doable out west because the horizon is farther out and there are less bushes so its easier to find camp. Either way make sure you have waypoints and backup plans emphasis on plural just as when hiking at day.   . More lumens does not equal better. The higher the lumens the brighter the stuff thats close and the darker the stuff thats far.  You may be surprised by how much you can see if youre calm and let your eyes adjust.  After a few minutes everything further than ft was better without the lamp. Your eyes will adjust.  I recommend a light with better batteries or more settings particularly if it has a red led over a really bright one.    Really the only difference is to bring some type of light. Partially to see the trail but more to see the map. Your eyes will adjust. I purposely went last night since its a waning crescent so just  illumination.   All you need to do is see the five feet of trail in front of you and dont leave it. I could see the first  feet around me much better with my petzl lamp.  Bring  lamps because you wont be able to set up camp without a lamp. You could lose one or break it. The weight of a lamp is not much more than extra batteries so dont bring extra batteries bring an extra lamp. But one lamp is fine if youre on a budget just dont lose it. .  If its your first time try to stick to fireroads for your first night. That way it will be almost impossible to lose the trail. Fire roads are a night hikers best friend because theyre easy to follow They dont have trees or make sharp turns since cars have to drive them.  On a fire road if youre in doubt of the trail generally forward is a good option.  Its hard to find a good campsite in the dark. You will be able to see the contour of the ground but not debris on it. An area might look flat and awesome to camp on but once you get there the ground could be rocky or covered in brambles or really thin trees. Last night I was walking on the slope of one hill and saw a a flat ridge in the valley. It was lower than the two hills next to it so the wind would be good. It looked perfect but when I got there it was covered in really thin trees. I couldnt see the trees in the distance only the contours of the ground.   If you go off trail to find camp only venture perpendicular to the trail. You dont want to get lost off the trail at night trust me. if youre looking for a site to camp remember you wont find the best one on the first try so keep a list of best ones and then once youre tired walk back to the best one thats closest. . Here is my most important tip if youre doing it alone...bring music. I like electronic dance music or upbeat pop something that will make me smile and want to dance not think about bears or being abducted by aliens. Seriously you dont want to get a panic attack in the middle of the night alone in the middle of the wilderness.   While night hiking your mind is your worst enemy. If you let go of it you will start thinking every gust of wind is a bear. This is why music is so important. You have to focus on positive things. Your ability to find and stay on the trail will drop dramatically if you start to panic. Even worry will have you second guessing and halve your pace. So remember bring a light but mainly to see the map. Stay on the trail. And bring a buddy or music so its easy to stay comfortable and centered. So yeah its really easy. Just bring a lamp and music and youll being saying damn that pstmaster guy was right this is really easy ,WildernessBackpacking,cxoxjgz,1,t5_2zmsv

5964377,0,t1_cy1dp18,Thanks! I definitely spend a lot of time experimenting with different gearwater setups.         Ive never had a problem with condensation getting anything wet. Maybe my water is generally closer to air temp or my Platypus bladder resists condensation more or something. My sensitive gear is in waterproof bags or in a pack liner anyway  so this isnt an issue at all for me.             With a fully loaded pack lbs  I dont notice the weight distribution of the bladder on the very top of my pack. I typically carry max  liters rarely . I live in an area abundant with water the Pacific Northwest.          I customize all my packs to some degree. Adding hip or shoulder pockets or cutting items out. Its a fun and relatively cheap way to make my gear specific for my needs.            I store my bladders full often. For months at a time they grow no bacteria. A double dose of bleach  drops per liter helps too but I store them without this often. I also drain dry and store then empty too. Both methods work. I dont put them in my fridge so cant comment on that part  just an option I read online.                  ,WildernessBackpacking,cy1glki,6,t5_2zmsv

I like the fit of the Salomon Quests but the cuffs were too high and caused me some tendinitis issues above my ankle. I ended up with the Asolo Reston. Unlike other Asolo boots they have a fairly wide toe box and a narrower heel. The soles were a tad slick at first but I think that was due to some factory coatings that needed to wear off. After the first few wears they had good grip. Buying at REI is a good idea since you can always return them after a few outings if they dont work for you.,WildernessBackpacking,d1owj44,1,t5_2zmsv

Get a cheap blue tarp to put over the cheap tent if needed although these tents may be better at keeping rain out than you expect. When youre camped show off your gear and tell them why youve invested in the good stuff.  But go out there have fun sit around the campfire and tell tall tales and laugh.

The thing with an IV is youre still going to have to fill it with water why not bring an extra water container instead?Instead of bringing extra weight you may not use for oh sht emergencies focus on planning and preparation so you can enjoy the journey fully. Of course absolutely bring a basic first aid kit. Most kits Ive seen do not include any kind of injectable since dehydration and altitude sickness can be treated in other ways.Get some good maps and google some JM trail guides many of which will say where water is available. That should give you an idea of how often youll be able to fill up. Depending on the frequency of water sources on a given day you might have to carry all your water or just a liter at a time. Plan on chugging wherever its plentiful. Avoid hyponatremia by eating regularly or add some sport drink mix.Also figure out how much water storage to carry by what your body needs for your gender weight and extra for the altitude heat and dry air.

If your trails have signal thats great just make sure youll have enough battery life.  Often lost hikers end up calling for help just as their batteries are almost dead.I personally use an inReach for going into remote areas with higher objective danger it offers both tracking points in case I cant hit the button and twoway communication.

9039757,0,t3_540lqj, Wicking  polypro or poly wicking or merino.  This is underwear and tshirt. lightweight insulation  long sleeve superlight fleece long underwear if needed.  I like the paradox stuff from Costco as it is cheap and decent.  I LOVE the Helly Hanson polypro stuff but it is grossly overpriced and holds stink.  Merino is also great but overpriced. shell layer.  Keep the wet off.  Decent pants and a decent rain shell.  waterproof soft shells or hard shells.  Prices vary wildly.  Right now Costco has a Paradox hard shell for  that is totally legit. Serious insulation for when you stop moving.  Down heavy fleece primaloft stuff wool.  Whatever works.  Fleece is cheapest up to very expensive if you like brand names.  You can find wool sweaters out the ying yang at goodwill and fleece there too.  All the big brands make primaloft jackets.  I love my melanzana hoody but it was almost a hundred bucks. hardshells for heavy rain are great.  Wear it when you have to and try not to wear it when moving if you can help it.  Waterproof breathable is only good until it wets out. socks  I like superlight merino.  It is worth the price.  When I sleep I wear a pair of heavier but super soft wool socks. Pants No cotton.  Get a pair of poly pants with some stretch.  Again check Costco.  Right now they have Travelers pants that are actually great hiking pants.  Just picked up a second pair for  after using the first ones for a few weeks.No companies are really worth insane prices.  BUT patagonia and arcteryx make very nice things.  Mountain hardwear has been good for me too though usually not a great price value.  If you want to rock brand names hit the REI garage sales and save some .If you have to buy the minimum from scratch here is what I use. bike short style poly underwear and a merino wool t shirt.. paradox long underwear top and bottom.  HH when it is miserably wet.. super light fleece pullover  first ascent from eddie bauer.  Huge sales once in a while.  Under .. Old patagonia rain shell  pullover  got it at an REI garage sale.  Wearing out after  years. You just need to keep the weather out.. Super melanzana hoody for when I stop moving.  VERY warm fleece.  andor patagonia nanopuff vest from REI garage sale.. hiking pants.  Your legs get wet it is ok.  They dry fast.. very lightweight merino wool socks.  forget brand.. trail runners or my hanwag boots.  Another REI garage sale find for both.  Amazing how many new things people return.. optionally I have a waterproof softshell jacket with a hood that is great too.  An aliexpress clone of a mammut jacket with no branding.  Works well but heavier than the hard shell.  I use it in the snow rather than the hard shell as it breathes better.I also recommend a sweet hat.  baseball cap if that is your thing watch cap for real cold and an Outdoor Research Seattle Sombrero for super rainy conditions.  Nothing matches it in the rain.Hope this helps.  You got a lot of good comments here.  Remember that it is about the utility of the item not the brand.  People get hung up and spend too much.

9342875,0,t1_d909lls,Keep in mind its not just the quality fill of the down but also the quantity of down which adds to the overall weight.  Just because one garment contains a higher fill power than another doesnt necessarily mean its going to be warmer  the quantity of down also has an effect. A jacket with g of  fill down for example will provide more warmth than one with g of  fill down. However it will obviously weigh a lot more! It will also be far less compressible due to it having far less air to be squeezed out. To sum up this example  it should now be clear that you need a lot of low fill power down to do the same job as a small amount of high fill power down! As a result lower fill power down garments i.e. in the  fill power range will usually be too heavy bulky and cumbersome to wear for high intensity activities like climbing skiing or hiking.,WildernessBackpacking,d909yml,3,t5_2zmsv

10236577,0,t3_5mkmr7,My suggestion is either the ACR ResQLink traditional PLB or the inReach SE satellite messenger.  Both have similar initial purchase prices but the latter will require a subscription.If you dont plan to take trips in more than part of the year you can do a month to month plan with the inReach and get the benefit of tracking and way texting for not much added cost.  Just multiply the monthly costs to see where the breakeven point is with the annual plans.If you dont need trackingtexting and just want a panic button the ACR will be much cheaper in the long run and you dont have to worry about things like making sure its charged before a trip it can largely live quietly in your pack  year battery life.  Also its somewhat smaller than the other device.Personally I like having way communications tracking and knowing if a message was sent.  The SE model no mapsetc. will still give me my coordinates making it a backup for my phone GPS.

11369901,0,t3_62956x,Ive heard good things about the MLD Trailstar for Scottish conditions. Its a sort of modified pyramid tarp that is fairly low to the ground making it very wind resistant. You can also use a bug inner either a dedicated one or a nettent to make it midge proof. I think pyramid tarps in general are the bees knees for windy wet conditions. I use them in all seasons in the PNW US which is probably somewhat comparable to Scottish conditions during our rainy shoulder seasons and winter. They do require a bit more fidgeting and fussing compared to a traditional tent though the weight savings are incredible and I find them to be equally as strong and weatherproof. Cheapest option  look for a Black Diamond Betalight on sale or used. I saw one go for  brand new with tags the other day.

I dont remember what the temps were but I was just wearing a thin long sleeve shirt so mid s probably. We did   miles over  days so only  night. Got down to around freezing but we were pretty close to a creek. Overall the weather was really nice but Id imagine that with the sun out it would be a bit on the warm side especially that much later in the season.,WildernessBackpacking,dg7bimb,1,t5_2zmsv
11610305,0,t1_dgc19pk,A L bladder is nice to have so you can fill it up at camp and use it for a while. You just dont want to carry more water than you need to because it is heavy. Get a data book that lists water sources so you know how far to your next one.,WildernessBackpacking,dgc1dzm,7,t5_2zmsv

11771927,0,t3_67wa6n,My family and I are doing the exact same thing.  We know what we want in life and are relocating for it.  I enjoy my career in manufacturingengineering.  We want to be close to a lot of backpacking and hiking trails.  We want to be close to a vet tech school for the wife.  Weve found all of that in the Greenville SC area.  There is a lot of manufacturing there.  There is a lot of backpacking camping and hiking opportunities within an hour or two.  There are a lot of young families and professionals in the area.  It has everything were looking for in a lifestyle.  Edit. I also work in the metal forming industry close die forging and isothermal forging.  There isnt much metal working going on in Greenville from what I can tell.  As you get up into the hills it gets harder to move and install the heavy equipment necessary for metal forming on an industrial scale.  Im looking at this as an opportunity to learn other processes and industries.,WildernessBackpacking,dgudofl,1,t5_2zmsv
