2805421,0,t1_cnmykxx,But to make that suggestion shouldnt they have a testimony from a doctor of the injuries in terms of the timing of the bruising and such? To make a claim in order to have a confession the meat of having a man convicted of murder thrown out the burden of proof falls on the defense to do more than merely suggest.,Broadchurch,cnmytox,6,t5_2wkk9
2805856,0,t1_cnn0fve,Well like I said American who has had very little contact with the Scottish so I dont really know what a thick accent would be.,Broadchurch,cnn0lzu,2,t5_2wkk9
2807489,0,t1_cnn6v1e,I dont blame Nigel. What else would he think and why should he think otherwise? Beth was to blame for attacking Ellie again but what else would she think? Oh Ellie is back in town to help DI Hardy whos no longer allowed to work on an old case and using her house as a meetup place for the suspect and his ex? Hardy took the risk again and hes the one to blame for losing Claire and the confession. I love the man but his judgment isnt always the best. And you can only have so many lapses of judgments until your entire character is legitimately called into question. Happens IRL all the time. ,Broadchurch,cnn7bhc,1,t5_2wkk9

3133223,0,t1_colz00h,TV writers have little problem writing up a scenario where  one cause of death is covered up with what looks like another cause of death. If Tom killed Danny I have no doubt there will be a logical explanation for the adult hand marks. ,Broadchurch,comr8mt,1,t5_2wkk9
3143338,0,t3_2w5707,I cant believe there are issues with the second series.  I am enjoying it more than the first series but that might just be me,Broadchurch,consyn8,22,t5_2wkk9
3149716,0,t1_coogb2b,The jury do decide the fate of the defendant but not the sentence. The judge has no power to overturn the decision of the jury and then gives a sentence if he is found guilty.,Broadchurch,coogqtt,8,t5_2wkk9

3223246,0,t1_couwlqa,People who murder children are treated worse than scum in prison. I cant speak from experience but I think theres some kind of hierarchy with kiddiefiddlers and child murderers being right at the bottom. Even repeat offenders who have murdered multiple people would kick the shit out them.,Broadchurch,cow3cj1,2,t5_2wkk9
3225794,0,t1_couwa0t,I hope not. If joe is murdered his ex wife shouldnt be part of the investigating team. She would be a suspect. Hardy may be too close as well ,Broadchurch,cowcw0w,4,t5_2wkk9

3796501,0,t3_33u6ty,I really enjoyed it. Definitely a different pace you can tell theyre reaching into the meat of what the creator wanted to do. Absolutely beautiful stunning cinematography. Def worth watching I think each season is good for different reasons.,Broadchurch,cqp14zk,1,t5_2wkk9
3884709,0,t1_cp33nwg,I agree with this wholeheartedly. Like Broadchurch it examines how one action affects the whole community. Its got beautiful scenery the acting is superb and the storyline is very well written. I finished watching it months ago and I still think about it every day. ,Broadchurch,cqz39ew,2,t5_2wkk9
3985596,0,t3_32vw1w,I just did the same thing today. Watched nearly the entire season in one sitting. Came for David Tennant ended up staying for a rather intimate look into a towns character and an edgeofyourseat murder mystery. Didnt know there would be any more I watched on Netflix didnt see a Season . I kind of liked it being ended. It felt complete like a good book where you still care about the characters and wonder how they move on but are content to leave it in the realm of imagination. ,Broadchurch,craldhy,3,t5_2wkk9

10986816,0,t1_ded0qee,Thanks for bringing this to my attention! Its strange I dont see it on my Podcasts app either but we are getting episode downloads and Libsyn says the episode has been publish.I wonder if this is due to our long absence... Ill try to figure it out by tonight. Until then heres the download link ,Broadchurch,dedbk4o,1,t5_2wkk9
11254940,0,t1_df7im8g,Going back to series  Joe wore a blue jacket like Ellies orange one. Hardy lived in a blue cottage in series  and he wears blue constantly.Throughout the series blue has marked a lot of sadness. Ellie and her orange coat seem to symbolize sunrise and hope. Blue and orange are contrasting colours. A friend whos into cinematography and set design pointed this out to a bunch of us on Tumblr.,Broadchurch,df7qb0r,7,t5_2wkk9

11364211,0,t1_dfhl8r8,Maybe he wanted to create a tragedy to get people to go to church more often to seek hope,Broadchurch,dfk4185,1,t5_2wkk9
11444541,0,t1_dft50yj,Ian seemed pretty compliant about handing the laptop over but didnt seem to want to disclose the details of what exactly it was. Considering that Ian hasnt dumped it off or hammered it to smithereens like Ellie did it seems like whatevers in that laptop is important to him as well. ,Broadchurch,dft88h3,1,t5_2wkk9
11457858,0,t1_dfu8bv1,I think the vicars arc will end with him full of regret for not going with Mark to find Joe bc he couldve potentially saved him.,Broadchurch,dfuqnqm,2,t5_2wkk9
11541018,0,t1_dg03a4h,After last nights episode and him saying he loves sex...and his wife Cath not really giving it to him for a while...Im really betting its him now.  He has to get it from SOMEWHERE and he wasnt getting it from Cath as much as he wanted.  With him having sex with Trish earlier that morning having sex with the waitress and not finishing...Im betting its Jim but...that kind of seems almost TOO obvious...and Chibnall isnt really THAT guy.,Broadchurch,dg46cp8,1,t5_2wkk9
11557562,0,t1_dfscov1,He has an Olivier Award. And he played the character Denzel just got nominated for an Oscar for in Fences on the stage. Hes more famous for comedy but hes a very accomplished actor too,Broadchurch,dg61y16,1,t5_2wkk9
11558844,0,t1_dg64ozs,gt I still dont entirely get the point of the newspaper womanIts really easy to send a message that all men are horrible and women are inherently morally superior when really its much more complicated than that.The toxic cultural environment that has produced these men isnt just perpetuated by men. There are a lot of women who actively promote it too. The newspaper woman doesnt care about the consequences of her actions just that she personally benefits from them  unlike the other women in the show whose terrible behaviour is a reaction to trauma. And that sort of attitude is what allows the culture to continue.,Broadchurch,dg676my,5,t5_2wkk9
