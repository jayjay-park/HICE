9090125,0,t1_d80ika2,. Moving a multiselected group causes the object counter to jump up and down.. Its apparently possible to use disallowed space by manually editing the txt savefile I discovered this by using the save for the old version of this level. You should add some checks to this.. Some elements are highlighted when moused over adders are not.. There are no hotkeys for two rightmost objects.. In the first level please add one row at right and bottom without moving the output for insane optimization. . Id recommend moving the playing area in levels with greyed out space from the top left to the middle just for better look.. Unify the two array inputs and outputs and switch between the two versions by hovering and pressing a number key to fit with the rest of the interface. . Idea alternate functionally identical variant for adder and substractor with two fields where you respectively enter column and row offset so basically the first fields value gets multiplied by  and added to the second.. Simple level idea upon refresh one pixel in input matrix with even x and y for optimization potential is red the others are white. The goal is to copy it to the output and surround it with  other red pixels. Optional harder variant there are also permanent unaffected by refresh black pixels in input which should be ignored and not colored.. Id like to see some levels with either minimal one pixel or no input whatsoever so the player has to make output based on verbally specified rules optionally with some stuff preoutputted like the ball bouncing video.. And also more levels with functionally useless decoration in input matrix like Address searcher. The white branches there were highly aesthetically pleasing.. In planning mode please make output matrix fullcolor make it blackened only when the program is launched.. Make alttabbing work properly during loading screen.. Remember fullscreen settings between restarts.. Make the program pause after the adders applied and display the process  for example show the sensor value in two rows  the old one above new one above with a  in the middle.. Add visual confirmation of submitting a counter to the output  for example show the trail counters leave on normal path on the output.. When the program is running make keys  skip     cycles.. Numpad input doesnt work.. Idea multiple difficulties of the same level kinda like Subterra differing in the number of rows and columns or some level mechanic. For example  The current th level would be the hard version adding one row and column  easy  An easier version of th level where instead of current standard submission to output well need to submit the two values as an array so the player doesnt need to track the number of counters submitted.. Explain the way priorities of different counters work in the help e.g. one counter tries to move into a space which the other tries to move out of. Do they combine?.. Instead of making unusable parts of input and output white and constantly explaining that they dont count as white pixels change the actual size of the respective matrix by resizing the white border this will also look great.. Itd be nice to see input randomization in levels with input matrix like  or .. Looking back over the levels I think the second one should be scrapped entirely  while its a good idea to introduce nonsequential output this level requires a convoluted solution that is unnecessary anywhere else due to having the element that reads colors from input matrix which is absent in this level. It teaches doing the wrong stuff basically. It also cannot be put later since that would require losing an already existing element.. Clear all button shamelessly stolen from the other thread just to keep everything in one place. New multierase does the job perfectly.v .. Game window in taskbar is named GameMaker Studio.. The new method of placing arrows is subpar lets say. It is impossible to make nonorthogonal lines any diagonal line makes useless shapes five downward arrows in one column and five in the next one for example and its impossible to place hollowcolored arrows. Its better than before and straight white lines are going to account for  of the usage of this feature anyway but theres definitely room for improvement. I still recommend you use one of my ideas from point .. Recoloring held objects places unintended arrows on the field and also sometimes spawns this arrowplacing ray thingy which can only be resized vertically.. The objectplacing interface is inconsistent  eraser is situated away from everything else and breakpoint cannot be placed using this panel at all.. Help interface is highly inconsistent  some elements counter teleporter sensor list their own name at the start of their description some describe their action from third person paints the counter some describe what happens with the object not being the subject the counters value goes to  array inputs are described as they. General style problems hold left mouse instead of hold left mouse button. Last block contains a chaotic mix of different themes a sentence about saves is immediately followed by a sentence about the counter priority mechanic.. You really should do something with that squaredcircle element with scrambled description. Either remove it or add explanation to it.Top priority Multiselect bug in point .Breakpoints in points  .More levels.Well looks like Ive completed everything I could. The only level left is Address searcher which I have no idea whatsoever how to solve specifically the part where I have to keep track of the number of pixels outputted. I have to say that my opinion was greatly improved over the course of this playthrough and I was honestly amazed at the design of the later levels especially Address searcher and also the ball bouncer and maze in gameplay videos. . edit Phew finished th level. It was a real pain in the ass.My scores for the demo for nowLevel  cycles  objects.  .  .  .  .  .     .  .  .   unsolved.  .  .    ,ChromaSupercomputer,d84hijy,2,t5_3gbo9
