4952592,0,t1_cuiffts,My opinion is that a healthy dose of apathy towards such things makes for a happier working life. Let everyone else do the stressing about things beyond their control.There was a recent acquisition of Fokker by GKN and although covered by an NDA everyone in the industry knew that GKN were in talks with and I quote a Dutch aerospace company. Thats gonna be either Fokker or much less likely part of MOOG. If only I was a more confident investor.,UKInvesting,cuitbr2,2,t5_2x42i
5508928,0,t1_cwftbj9,Id say lets do it. I like the sound of a your week in the stock market we could give it a shot. Anything to strike up some conversation would be nice its the least active investing subreddit but theres plenty to talk about where the LSE is concerned as well as uk investing in all other areas!,UKInvesting,cwftdru,1,t5_2x42i
5521770,0,t1_cwhekme,well I dont think value investors really look at stop losses.. Im not sure to be honest. I think they consider closing positions when they realise the fundamentals are wrong. I think at least. Im not sure when Buffett would close a position at a loss for instance..The thing about these guys is that they might not have been so successful if theyd been born in Japan or maybe theyd not have found anything to buy! I think its definitely better than blind luck and intuition hunches but Id want to combine it with some reassurance from technicals that I wasnt going to sit on a stock that should be going up.the guys on rinvesting are where you should ask. In fact theyd have a fit if they saw anyone advising anyone to pay any attention to technicals at all. Its like heresy to them.Not sure what you mean by mwa? you mean mas? moving averages? I think there must be live stock simulators you can  practice with. Really ought to be live or nearly live so its based on current events. otherwise its all history and you know what happens. Or you could put a small amount into a real account and see what you can do with it. but as you say the transaction costs will be quite hefty. The other factor with stocks particularly is slippage the difference between the price you see on screen and the average price that you actually get your shares for. It can be shockingly bad sometimes. When theres low liquidity on a stock you can get really really shitty fill prices. And this happens with stop losses as well since theyre converted to market orders if price hits the right level... So yeah this is another big factor with stocks that is essentially missing from heavily traded high volume indices and ETFs. there you nearly always know you can get a fill at the price you expect.What I mean about placing fibbonacci indicatrors is that youre supposed to draw them from high to low the recent high to recent low. But thats vague and is open to interpretation. Most obviously in terms of which timeframe and therefore which high and low... sometimes its obvious thoughtake a look here  I just moved back on the SampP and looked for somewhere that looked likely and saw this sure enough the fibonnacci fitted it perfectlyand again hereis that a prediction or just coincidence. If you look intraday youll probably find the other levels were stoppingdecision points intraday..Fibbonaccis predict extension levels as well  so when things go to new all time highs you can predict roughly where they might stop for a breather or turn around. sometimesThis is especially important and interesting when applied to indices like the SampP and FTSE  FTSE ..Not Fibonaccis but interesting anyway  during the crash of  the SampP stopped at . The FTSE was supported by the  month moving average.. take a lookbut over on rinvesting all this would be utterly ridiculed.,UKInvesting,cwhgf9a,2,t5_2x42i

11331867,0,t1_dffushj,Why the Vanguard LifeStrategy  fund?  I am at the point of  starting to also open an ISA with Charles Stanley also have less than k to invest.  Also of a similar age.  But really am not sure what LifeStrategy fund to pick do you think that the  in bonds  gilts will help significantly over time if there was a problem with the market?  I am new and inexperienced so just trying to learn understand a bit more before I make a decision.  I had thought that there wouldnt be much difference between the  and the  but that the  low risk offered by the  fund isnt really that much protection against anything.  I would have either thought a  split or full risk would make more sense.  Not criticising just trying to understand more your thought process. ,UKInvesting,dfgg4z2,1,t5_2x42i
11339213,0,t1_dfgq4mh,Thats kind of surprising I emailed them a while ago and thought they were pretty good. As for fx charges other than Degiro which doesnt offer ISAs do you know of a broker that has a cheaper fx rate than .? More than  seem to be the norm unfortunately.      For me I invest in US and UK stocks.,UKInvesting,dfha3b6,1,t5_2x42i
