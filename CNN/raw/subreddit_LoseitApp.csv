6593557,0,t3_45zmw1,Awesome to have a LoseIt sub! Username is LesGetFit on LoseIt.  mids woman here SW  CW . LoseIt GW is  but Im now thinking I will go lower maybe . Ive been using LoseIt since mid August and Im happy with my progress. Its my first weight loss attempt although Ive neededwanted to forever. Im now at  calories per day and  have been struggling a little with that. Ive been super busy so I havent been very active in the app. Im trying to jump back in because the interaction on the app helps so much. Glad to meet everyone and thanks to Danielle for making the sub!,LoseitApp,d01btfl,2,t5_3ck87
