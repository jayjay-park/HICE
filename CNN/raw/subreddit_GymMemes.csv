Once again we have the people who have no real knowledge on the differences between a crossfit program and a general lifting program.,GymMemes,cfagwio,0,t5_2wulh

1038202,0,t1_chm7vl1,I am not an attorney nor am I trying to make legal based arguments or points. You dont need to try to help me make my point when you dont even get my point. My point is that the reasoning behind them being classified as a federally illegal narcotic was total BS in the first place. They were classified that way because of an Olympic scandal because of cheating in sports. Not because they cause harm or health problems or because they are dangerous but because they are considered cheating. Its like they made pine tar illegal to possess because baseball players use it to cheat. Has no correlation to the general public they are supposedly trying to protect. I wouldnt expect my argument to hold up in a court room but this is reddit not a court of law. My standing position is that they should have never been classified as they are. The good highly outweighs the bad. It can cause great health benefits in many people with various diseases and can have great benefits to already healthy people. There are no deaths or health problems proven to be directly related to its use. As it was previously mentioned tobacco serves no health benefits to the public and is associated with around  deaths a year if Im not mistaken and is regulated and taxed. The same should be done with steroids. Regulate it tax it and sell it to people of an adult age. ,GymMemes,chmar4s,1,t5_2wulh
