1704405,0,t3_2dv99e,I am super interested in this kinda setup myself! I wish I could find more detailed information for whats in the conditioning solution for sea monkeys so you can extrapolate that for larger volumes. As far as plants go im looking at some species that would tolerate it too but im assuming these guys need some serious airation. Then again ive never done something like this so what do I know.,Jarrariums,cju0390,1,t5_306nr
3829721,0,t3_33lja7,Im attempting it in mine Im using a DSM method and am just about ready to flood the jar. Ive actually placed the jar outside with plastic wrap on top and have just kept the water line at the surface of the substrate. It has now almost completely covered the substrate. Im still debating on how to handle the lighting. Im thinking of just putting it next to a window that doesnt get direct sun and see how that does. After that Ill see how well it does without doing any ferts other than the soil.  If things dont go well Ill end up dosing ferts and maybe adding an led clip on light. ,Jarrariums,cqstjr9,1,t5_306nr
4025335,0,t1_creit7r,Thanks yes the leaves will be emersed. Im just not sure if the roots should be in a substrate of some type or if they just literally sit in the water,Jarrariums,crf4954,1,t5_306nr

5645860,0,t1_cwwtia4,Thank you for sharing! I do see a few flaws that could have been the cause of your problems. Taking rock from the ocean is questionable as to whats living in or on it. Additionally while it might have been cycled it was cycled to accommodate the ocean not your enclosed system a much more demanding system. In terms of flow what did you use for your tank? Also yes lighting is key and Im aware of that.Edit also I will be documenting everything both salt and freshwater and I will be sure to post the blog sometime in the future! ,Jarrariums,cwwx968,1,t5_306nr
5646079,0,t1_cwwxxax,Sounds awesome! Where would I get a culture of phytoplankton? When should introduce them in terms of my cycle of the live rock? How does one know how large or small the culture is? How would I know when I should put the corals in? Youre being a huge help thank you so much btw!,Jarrariums,cwwy8d6,1,t5_306nr

6908431,0,t3_48j7li,Ive got a ramshorn and a couple of Malaysian Trumpet Snails. There are a ton of babies around of both but none appear to be reaching maturity. The only thing I can think of is that there isnt enough food in the tank to sustain high numbers so they die. The shrimp get a tasty protein enriched snack my guess at least. ,Jarrariums,d0ze2a4,2,t5_306nr

7470587,0,t3_4hp842,This is my office jar. Dwarf hairgrass is the main carpet plant theres some dwarf sag in there too. Bigger plant was sold as laceleaf to my friend but we think its water sprite instead after some research. I want to add a few taller plants just havent snagged any from my planted tank at the house yet.,Jarrariums,d2rczkx,2,t5_306nr

7571704,0,t3_4j1jvc,Its only one gallonbut it was free so Im happy. I threw a Frogbit in from my planted tank to test out the LED I had laying around. If that isnt working Ill use indirect sunlight.I really want to end up spending no money at all so I have dirt from the backyard baked capped with pool filter sand and lace rock from my established tank.Im thinking about taking trimmings from my planted tank as well but there really isnt much in there to propagate since I made some changes to it. Has anyone tried taking plants from a local stream?,Jarrariums,d32v6fx,1,t5_306nr
7601088,0,t1_d34yxwa,Thanks! Its about  gallon big and I got it from this shop in korea that sells cute home deco items.,Jarrariums,d367e72,1,t5_306nr
7678536,0,t1_d3ey3mt,Do i need to feed these things any special food or introduce anything? As long as they stay tiny and are not worms I fear insects Im okay with their existence but now I worry they have nothing to eat in their environment.,Jarrariums,d3f05ey,1,t5_306nr
7888689,0,t1_d42nfxa,Cool post! I had to google daphnia because Ive never heard of them before. Thats interesting though I wonder how well they could survive in a planted community tank. Seems like a winwin if they can filter your water and be food for the fish. Or you think they might not make it very long with the filter and all that sucking them up?,Jarrariums,d42rfgy,1,t5_306nr

10203613,0,t3_5luzyu,If you follow the walstad method you dont. It uses what is known as a silent cycle the plants serve to remove ammonia nitrites and nitrates. Given that walstad tanks dont even use a filter the beneficial bacteria only build up on the gravel.,Jarrariums,dc0mxfq,1,t5_306nr
10594510,0,t3_5rnp68,It looks like a great start! I would recommend getting some snails as a clean up crew. They will eat brown algea and dying plant matter as well as the fish food you add as a fertalizer. This also helps keep your water parameters clean. ,Jarrariums,dd8qpsp,3,t5_306nr

10820906,0,t3_5unkfb,Some Cabomba would look amazing in there for sure itll grow nice and tall and will really fill out some of that space.I think itd be neat to get some driftwood sticks and use them to make a sort of mangroveswamptype scape in there.Whatever you do you HAVE to let us see the results!!! Great find!,Jarrariums,ddw3m9d,2,t5_306nr
11123909,0,t1_desvoi5,You will need to do some water changes to replenish certain elements in the water. Shrimp need minerals to form their exoskeletons. Also make sure your ammonia and nitrite are at .,Jarrariums,desvwfu,3,t5_306nr
