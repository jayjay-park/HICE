4893439,0,t1_cuaxygo,Also Lady Gaga mentioning that she wants to be the next Iron Maiden puts the name in the heads of the Googling masses.   Her saying that comment probably incidentally created at least a thousand new Iron Maiden fans.   The same as someone like Miley Cyrus or Rihanna wearing a Ramones or Judas Priest shirt.   Not all kids but some of them will say that looks cool.   Im gonna look that up.  And some of those kids will love what they hear.   In that respect the ends more than justify the means.   Beyond that how does anyone know whether or not these pop stars really like this music.   Influences come from everywhere and people like what they like.   Hell I have an Eddie tattoo and Ive been listening to Iron Maiden for over  years.   I sing in a band that gets compared to Kyuss fairly often.   But I also like The Smiths Justin Timberlake Snoop Dogg and Burt Bacharach.   Theres no rule that says because you create one style of music that its the only thing youre allowed to enjoy.   ,ironmaiden,cubcvd2,4,t5_2rinz
4953904,0,t3_3icyhi,I caught a listen of it today. This is the strongest Maiden album Ive heard in a long time. Their last few albums had a couple songs I liked but I didnt love them as much as Maidens older albums. The Book of Souls though packs the same punch as their very best. Bruces voice is unbelievably strong here and he has some incredible melodies in all the songs.Theres guitar riffs everywhere on this album and theyre the kind of riffs that wont leave your head for days. Each of the songs are really catchy and they have great progressions. Songs go from soft instrumental sections to heavy power chord riffage to fingershredding solos... and then back again occasionally. Personal favorites If Eternity Should Fall which starts off atmospheric and then breaks out into a classicsounding Maiden progression. The Great Unknown which reminds me a lot of Dance of Death. When the River Runs Deep where the heavy guitar riffs run deep too. This song has one of my favorite verses of the album.Shadows of the Valley whose opening reminds me of Wasted Years and then splits into a galloping masterpiece. Empire of the Clouds is an minute prog rock epic. If Iron Maiden were to attempt something like Rushs  in their own tone it might sound similar to this song. It starts slow with more great vocal work from Bruce over a haunting piano melody and the trademark distorted guitars. Then it continues to change with each section blending into new unique Maiden riffs. Its an excellent closer. ,ironmaiden,cuiza1u,9,t5_2rinz
4955837,0,t1_cuiv3m1,Its going to take me several listens to develop an educated opinion but this album just really gripped me from the first song to the last.

I would absolutely love If Eternity Should Fail if the silly talkingacoustic bit at the end was cut out. Tears of a Clown is dope. The rest I honestly cant remember too well. Overall maybe a  Empire of the Clouds is this albums saving grace from being just another modern Maiden album not that its bad just this song brings it up a notchOne difference I love between the longest songs on this album Empire of the Clouds Red and Black Book of Souls as opposed to some of the other long songs from modern Maiden Brighter Than  Suns Isle of Avalon is that they dont just drag on forever to me.

10753343,0,t3_5tsely,One of their greatest and one of the ones that got me hooked onto Maiden. i remember watching Flight  for the first timemy first real exposure to Maiden and the version of this song really stood out to me. It was one of the first ten or so Maiden songs I downloaded from iTunesfrom there I would slowly own all of their discography and its pretty much always been in my top ten Maiden songs and the best from Piece of Mind. ,ironmaiden,ddp4iwi,4,t5_2rinz
10825786,1,t3_5uslph,Quest for Fire is a ludicrous song about cavemen with a truly terrible opening line that mentions dinosaurs because apparently Steve was asleep in history class. The bass is on fire though and the chorus is memorable for better or worse. Whoever suggested that Bruce hit those high notes in the second lines of the first two verses deserves a serious beating cause they are awful.,ironmaiden,ddwlqkg,1,t5_2rinz

10883495,0,t1_de1xuw9,I actually adore Maidens prog material and progressive music as a whole. But Satellite  at least in my opinion is far from a progressive sound its the same repeating drum percussions dragged notes and bass line over and over... and it lasts !!! The only good thing it achieves is a change in tempo between Satellite  and The Final Frontier at the  mark... They couldve shortened it by a full  minutes.,ironmaiden,de2jzt8,1,t5_2rinz

11427726,0,t3_6336tf,I wouldnt be surprised if they dropped either Blood Brothers or Wasted Years from the encore probably to substitute Run to the Hills.  I think the most likely to be dropped from the main set are Powerslave and Death or Glory maybe Tears of a Clown not sure what would be played in place I wouldnt mind Empire of the Clouds but thats probably not going to happen.  I bet everything else is safe.,ironmaiden,dfrbk8s,2,t5_2rinz
