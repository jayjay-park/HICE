Bring your own kart unlimited runs as long as they dont have a race. Its a pretty nice track too.

1866418,0,t1_cke1rea,My personal experience with the Chondas and observations of fellow racers left me with a different opinion.   yes.  hp? More like half that.  Reliable while built to hp?  Two engine hours seems the norm.  The world formula classes can and have achieved sufficient reliability but at high maintenance costs.  Weekly teardowns are the norm to compete at the regional level. The LO motor package is a great entry level option.  Sealed motor runs on pump gas and costs  complete with intake exhaust and clutch package.  Cheaper to replace the motor at  than to hire an experienced mechanic to keep the franken engines running.  Doesnt have anywhere near the power of the other classes but that is a good thing when you are starting out.,Karting,cke3iwd,1,t5_2s6js

2077759,0,t3_2imekg,I almost never recommend a shifter to someone new to karting as their first kart.  Given your experience theres no doubt youll be able to handle driving it but its going to be a hell of a ride with a pretty vertical learning curve.If youve never driven a shifter or a highlevel formula car then youve never driven anything this quick.  After driving it everything is going to seem slow...flying in airplanes youll be like why are we going so slow?If you want to just have a kart to mess around with on the weekends and dont have intentions of racing then theres nothing better than a Stock Moto CR shifter.  Run it on old used tires keep the jetting rich and have a blast.If you want to race if you want to actually learn how to drive then I would look elsewhere.  Anything single speed  Briggs Rotax  is going to teach you how to preserve momentum keep your corner speed up and be smooth.  Shifters are a blast to drive but theyll teach you bad habits especially if youre new to karting.  If you make a mistake just drop a gear and power out of the corner.  In a single speed if you make a mistake you have to live with it into the next corner and maybe the one after that...I had the opportunity to meet Ryan HunterReay a few weeks ago hes the guy who won the Indy  this year and we got to talking about karting hes a x WKA national champion and he told me this Shifters are fun to drive and a its hell of a workout but they dont really teach you anything.  The Rotaxes teach you how to drive and how to race.Also keep in mind that dynamically karts drive and tune much much differently than cars.Ive been racing karts for the last  years in Rotax Shifters and Briggs.  I recently switched from the Shifter to the Briggs and ive never had this much fun racing the competition is unbelievably close and you have to be mega precise to be quick.  That and I simply couldnt afford to be competitive in the shifter anymore.  They will eat tires brake pads and fuel like you wont believe and if your competition is running new tires and youre not...you can expect to be in the back.That said its a great sport no matter what you choose.  IMO theres no better motorsport for the average guy than karting.  Also should you decide on a shifter mines going to be up for sale shortly....,Karting,cl3xfm2,6,t5_2s6js

2206059,0,t1_clk6a45,True. But like in super kart when theyre going so fast and if they contact wheels they could easily flip and Id imagine having a kart land on you would injure them more than like leg and knee injuries that soccer players sustain no?,Karting,clk8sca,1,t5_2s6js
2214370,0,t1_cllace0,Theyre just different much like a Tesla Roadster vs. a Lotus Elise.The electric karts are very strong off the line then taper off at the top end.  The gas karts start kind of slow pick up through the mid high then finally dropoff at top speed.  So I supposed electric karts are a little faster off the line but the gas karts can be more fun to try to keep it in the powerband through tight sections.  The difference is really minor though theyre about the same on the butt dyno I constantly flip flop about which I think is faster.,Karting,cllasrp,1,t5_2s6js

While locking up the brakes on corner entry may have helped in comparison to amateur no offense meant  just trying to differentiate drivers current strategies it is absolutely not the fastest way to drive in the rain.Again if you watch any national level kart race in the rain you wont see one person drifting to go fast.

2877360,0,t3_2t2rv6,This is a young Jamie McMurray of NASCAR holding his kart steady while someone pours lead shot into the tubes of the chassis.  Apparently this is an old school trick to make weight then allows the lead shot to roll out during the race making the kart lighter to gain an advantage.  This is no longer an issue with postrace weighins but still illustrates why I like rental karts due to the inability of people to gain the upper hand through underhanded methods like you have in bringyourown karting.,Karting,cnv5obw,0,t5_2s6js

Its the cocky rental drivers that have never raced before and are sure they will be the fastest that cant fathom someone passing them that end up zipping into peoples way and causing wrecks.

Locally there were only  other regular drivers in the same classweight for me to run with and one is moving up to shifters while the other is moving over to a Rotax.  The strokes have had a much stronger showing at each race and Im much closer in age to that group of drivers anyway.  So all in all much better fit.

Though top speed is lower its actually pretty fun and gets really grippy because its short enough to really warm it up with just a couple of fast sessions.This is me driving on the combined track at Track  they definitely do at least  mph.I know full well how fast race karts go because I own one after all but it doesnt change the fact that these rentals are plenty fast to be fun challenging and dangerous in the hands of an idiot.  I dont know why everyone thinks that because someone drives rentals they have no idea how fast a stroke kart is.  F drivers would still enjoy a spec Miata race...Theres also this rental kart in Houston its the fastest rentalbodied kart you can rent right now in Houston and it probably reads about  mph slow on the GPS due to lag at the top speed.
