6389150,0,t1_czfvjk3,You are stubbornly holding onto sin.   Im finished with the discussion. Im just going to be with the following. The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness since what may be known about God is plain to them because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world Gods invisible qualitieshis eternal power and divine naturehave been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that people are without excuse. For although they knew God they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creatorwho is forever praised. Amen. Because of this God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. Furthermore just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God so God gave them over to a depraved mind so that they do what ought not to be done. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness evil greed and depravity. They are full of envy murder strife deceit and malice. They are gossips slanderers Godhaters insolent arrogant and boastful they invent ways of doing evil they disobey their parents they have no understanding no fidelity no love no mercy. Although they know Gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.Romans   NIV,spiritfilledbelievers,czfvoxy,1,t5_2wd4t

God commanded war throughout the OT and Jesus will be coming back riding a war horse in his triumphal return.There wont be tomahawk missiles in the kingdom of God because they are innefective compared to the power of God present in every believer.,spiritfilledbelievers,dg6e5r5,1,t5_2wd4t
