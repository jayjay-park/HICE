3539491,0,t1_cpvojs7,Yes. Seems like a lot of tile floors are so shinyclean that it looks like polished concrete. Vice versa for this brochure  of the Manassas Mall Walmart when it opened.Im not sure what the interior was but since it was around for  years as a regular Walmart it must have started as the s theme for sure. Im not sure if it remodeled most likely to the  black and blue theme or the  Futura theme.As for the Burke store the comment youI mentioned is here  being the th comment down.,retailporn,cpvq3ah,1,t5_2tla7
