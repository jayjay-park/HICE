1120546,0,t1_chvn4tc,I feel like its pretty important for people to realize that the average age of onset for schizo is early s. A little earlier for men and later for women. And although weed absolutely can not cause it it can trigger it in individuals who are predisposed. If you have any family history of schizophrenia or suspect you may be prone due to other indicators poor childhood environment other existing disorders etc. Id personally recommend that you either stay away from it entirely you also save money p  or be extremely cautious with monitoring your state of being in regards to future use. Source My fathers brother had it died young from related factors so I madly hue avoid anything harder than weed and keep an extremely close eye on everything else.,sanitycheck,chvo00z,1,t5_31zua
