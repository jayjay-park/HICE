7221195,0,t1_d1ys692,I dont think we are meant to feel sorry for Sarah at all. With a line like I dont make mistakes this paints a very sharp portrait of a woman who is so at ease with her place in the hierarchy of the movement that she literally believes shes attained some higher superpower that puts her above normal human folly. I think the parallels between Sarah and Hawk are really interesting because neither one can seem to handle things when something goes wrong. And yet both believe strongly in helping others.I believe that Sarah loves Eddie deeply for the very reasons shes mentioned. Eddie can love Eddie is her window Eddie is a model father Eddie is a living testament to the power of the healing Meyerism preaches. And so the infidelity angle is as I mentioned truly her biggest fear. Shes already seen this played out with her own parents and they havent achieved the rung status she has. She thinks she should be above this.But this is why its so important for her that Eddie commits to the program. He has to repent but she also needs his devotion back steady and strong. She thrives on that shit and her plea why wasnt I enough? is what she cant get over. I think this makes Sarah a very interesting character and I confess I want to know more about her upbringing in the movement. I think its brave that shes the matriarch of Meyerism and yet shes rather unlikable. I do agree that Eddie leaving in the middle of the night after their agreement was clunky and poorly contrived but then that first episode was chock full of weird contrivances that I hope they will continue to move past. The scene itself with Sarah witnessing Eddie going to the motel door was a powerful one but it should have come several episodes later in the story not right off the bat when we barely know these people and what they mean to each other. ,ThePathHulu,d1yztti,1,t5_3brwj
7296660,0,t3_4f982f,Yes! It took me a whole episode to figure out who he reminded me of but as soon as I got it I knew Id never be able to unsee it.,ThePathHulu,d27kwtz,3,t5_3brwj
7432791,0,t1_d2jhe5s,I was wondering about that too. The guy she was with even kind of resembled Hawk especially the curly hair and darker features. Plus there was that bit with him leading her off into a private area before she collapsed on the floor.On the other hand she mentioned that she was still carrying the fetus when she traveled down to Peru there was no heartbeat so she was waiting for her body to naturally expel it and even if she miscarried at some point during the trip and didnt realize it due to drugs or selfdelusion its pretty unlikely that shed wind up pregnant immediately after a miscarriage.Her memory of the event isnt exactly reliable though so who knows.,ThePathHulu,d2n27rq,1,t5_3brwj
7506985,0,t3_4gy3yd,I watched Going Clear not that long ago because of The Path and it was as crazy as I heard stories about Scientology on TV. Hubbard was a scifi writer so obviously he was good at making shit up with all the mythos and backstory he can imagine. It always feels like people forget he was a writer first right? I feel bad for the people that get suckered into it but I can see the powerful preying on the weak. Happens every single day whether youre in Scientology or not. Why dont the people just say completely made up BS at the auditing sessions that could never be supported by evidence? Problem solved.Have you read that Leah Remini tell all book? ,ThePathHulu,d2vi7x5,1,t5_3brwj

7685069,0,t1_d3fojt9,Its basically Scientology Lite. Theres a lot of emphasis on the self and the mind. There are a lot of similarities to the Meyerist movement but dont all cults sound the same??? but they dont necessarily target vulnerable people. Its mostly smart people or ones with a lot of money. ,ThePathHulu,d3fqtrv,4,t5_3brwj
7720360,0,t3_4kx508,Oh fuck. So many questions. Was Silas keeping Meyer knocked out and with him gone Meyer is coming to regain the throne?What game of thrones shit does Sarah have planned?Does Allison really believe or is she kayfabing to find answers? Did the journal really just give her evidence that her husband was murdered?And by the way Sarahs face turn was expertly done. After being a heel the entire season her turning face had me marking out and cheering for her after spending the last  weeks shitting on her entire life. This is such a goddamn great series. I cant wait for next season. ,ThePathHulu,d3jr33a,10,t5_3brwj

7830723,0,t1_d3iqsyl,One thing that annoyed me about the invisible ink scene was it filled the wall and she was too short for that shit.  Their set designer needs to up his game just a tade P I didnt realize it was the finale and Ive been waiting impatiently for the next episode and it just got long enough I started searching for the answer.  That cliff hanger is outrageous Im not often left this intrigued.  I only want to know what happens the next day and the loop would be closed damn it.  Great analysis!  ,ThePathHulu,d3w8o4g,2,t5_3brwj

11177207,0,t3_5zh3vy,Those were devices to show the movement in its purity so that the viewer understands what the movement is about.

11517935,0,t1_dg0jji8,Wait i just rewatched the popstar pool scene. I dont think there was anything blatant about him wanting to leave as a teen or even wanting to leave the movement currently. When he said I know you do he was looking at her gun and they were clearly referring to suicide. He calls Sarah right after and says I dont think I can live with the person Ive become. I think Cal was saying he knows what its like to want to end your life not wanting to leave the movement. He ended up saving that girls life which was one of the most touching moments in the entire series for me.EDIT If this is just about wanting to leave the movement why have a gun in the scene at all?,ThePathHulu,dg1k5hq,-1,t5_3brwj
11552382,0,t1_dg5gnqg,Its up for me.  Sometimes Hulu glitches for me and doesnt show new stuff right away.  If you do a search for the path mercy it might come up.,ThePathHulu,dg5gsax,1,t5_3brwj
