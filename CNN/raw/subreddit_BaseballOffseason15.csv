Because Im not gonna lie I have times like last week where I just get stupidly busy in real life and take too long to do this kind of stuff.

2273905,0,t1_clsqkss,Heres my problem with this. Those trades are the exception rather than the rule. So all the time is false. And they are generally panned. The Fister deal as an example. Why should we use that as an excuse to hold ourselves to lower standards? Moreover your argument doesnt address deals where just blatant trade rape happens for no reason. That needs to be blocked. As Reds has said taking advantage of others has no place.Finally yeah we have lots of deals. I dont mind if a deal is slightly unbalanced as long as its not ridiculous. The trades Ive had an issue with have been the ridiculous ones. The Bravess deals and the attempted Lackey deal fit that criteria. So Im not saying we need to be trade Nazishell I agree with you that we want lots of tradesjust that when you say there is a reasonable justification that gets at what Im saying here that there hasnt been that for some deals. gtNo GM should have to make a trade and think wow am I giving the other guy a fair shot here? I should give up more so it doesnt get vetoed. THAT is more unrealistic than any trades we make.Uhhh no. Basically you shouldnt be in a position where the deal is so unbalanced you have to think that in the first place. Make a fair offer to begin with and dont try to fuck the guy over its that simple. ,BaseballOffseason15,clsruye,3,t5_32h97

3190905,0,t3_2w8cth,Ill give you the tldr.    roster    I went from wanting to rebuild to going for it in the span of a week. I accomplished neither. Partly due to the fact the White Sox spent more than I thought they would irl and by the time I figured that out players were already signed.    Acquired Navarro from Blue Jays for prospect.  Tyler Kolek and company for Alexei Ramirez   Signed Nori Aoki    Near the end I had a trade agreed upon for Cole Hammels if I could acquire more talent to waive his NTC. Scherzer was what I was trying for but he became way too much.    Projected Lineup    Adam Eaton CF  Marcus Seimen SS  Jose Abreu B  Avi Garcia RF  Dioner Navarro DH  Matt Davidson B  Carlos Sanchez B  Nori Aoki LF  Tyler Flowers C    Rotation    Chris Sale  Jose Quintana  Hector Noessi  John Danks  Erik JohnsonCarlos Rodon    RPs  Nate Jones  Matt Lindstrom  Erik Surcamp  Daniel Webb  Zack Putnam  Scott Carroll  Maikel Cleto       Next time Ill be a GM,BaseballOffseason15,cosqjo3,0,t5_32h97

4267422,0,t3_39rfnv,AJ Pollock Nick Ahmed Peter OBrien Jake Lamb for Carlos Martinez and Peter BourjosI like this deal alot. AJ Pollock has put up . fWAR and deserves to start in the AllStar Game. Ahmed still cant hit but his defense is incredible. I traded him away anyway. Peteys got a  wRC in AAA Jake Lamb is doing fantastic with a  wRC and above average defense short sample size blah blah blah hes still good. I didnt know CMart would wind be a SP and hes doing real good but his . FIP doesnt quite excite me like Pollock does. Wow Bourjos has a negative DEF value.Kolten Wong Charlie Tilson Carson Kelly for Aaron Judge Shane Greene Antoan Richardson Miguel Andujar Nick RumbelowWHY DOES WONG DECIDE TO BE GOOD NOW??? Judge is still amazing and Rumbelow still strikes out everybody. Ill leave it.Jaime Garcia  M and buyouts for Kyle Parker and Scott Oberg Garcia is doing good sigh. Kyle Parker has a  wRC in the majors and Oberg gives up too many homers. This trade sucks for now but eh I got years of team control. Sam Freeman and Randal Grichuk for Caleb Thielbar Travis Harrison Felix JorgeFreeman is sucking just like I thought he would! Grichuk is doing alright for now but his peripherals indicate hes gonna come crashing down soon. Also his defense isnt as good as his DEF value indicates I would still rather have Piscotty. Thielbar has pitched  good innings but he got sent down for some reason. Hed still be on my MLB team. Felix Jorge isnt as good as I thought he would be but hes done aight at A ball. Harrisons got a . OBP in AA. This deal isnt as horrible as I originally thought. I shouldve pushed for Gonsalves instead of Jorge. Tim Cooney and Alex Reyes for Robert Refsnyder and Cody MartinMartin and CoonDog are basically a wash. Ref has had his defense problems but he is batting ... at AAA. Reyes dumbfounds me. Kiley McDaniels loves him now. I know his stuff is amazing and probably got better but he still struggles with command. Id rather bet on Refs defensive woes B isnt that hard sounds like hes got the Knoblauchyips than Reyess command. Reyes does have ace upside so I could regret this. For now I dig it.Christain Colon Foster Griffin Ramon Torres for Shane Greene Nick Rumbelow Nick AhmedI shouldve asked for Moose...My RP signings did alright and my minor leaguers werent completely worthless.,BaseballOffseason15,cs6nn6l,3,t5_32h97
