Id also suggest Pinkers The Language Instinct for a good popular introduction to the general field as well.After that textbooks and teaching materials might be worthwhile looking into. If you can get your hands on it Richard Larsons Grammar as Science is a wonderful book for teaching syntax. Another really good introduction that goes from the beginning is Carnies Syntax A Generative Introduction.Harder to get a hold of and somewhat expensive is Uriagerekas Rhyme and Reason which is similar to Hofstaders Godel Escher and Bach and has some interesting discussions on modern methodological viewpoints though its less an introduction or a textbook.,generativelinguistics,d5ba688,3,t5_33s12
