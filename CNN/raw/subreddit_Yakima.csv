Theyre service is great and they also have awesome prices! If you decide to go I have to recommend the cheese filled pastries in the back right of the store. I dont know what they are called but they have  different types of cheese in them along with jalapenos and ham. OMG! Soo gooood!,Yakima,cqoso0l,5,t5_2r8m7
