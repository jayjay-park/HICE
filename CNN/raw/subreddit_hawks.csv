923542,0,t1_ch992je,I dont know. The wild is a team that plays something that vaguely resembles hockey but it works. The Avs had the upper hand against them and they adapted to that style and came back. I feel that the Avs and Hawks have some similarities in their style of play the speed for instance. I dont take the wild lightly and Hawks need all the help they can take. Having said that Sharp has more than an on and off mode.

1141507,0,t3_276m4y,Sorry Im going to go ahead and positively rant this is for my own sanity...anyways I was really depressed about the loss since Sunday but this morning I was on the train listening to Dreaming with a Broken Heart and I kid you not the next song that came up on my  song playlist was Chelsea Dagger and I just got excited about next season again and our future.I will admit I wasnt the biggest Blackhawks fan prior to the drafting of Patrick Kane. I followed some of the Amonte seasons including that crushing playoff series loss to the freaking Blues but the Hawks were never on TV during my prime sports fan growth so we drifted apart. Also the mid s lockout that eliminated NHL on ESPN didnt help. Anyways prior to the Kane draft I read an insane amount of articles about this future American phenom and I got excited about hockey again and in the  season I was absolutely hooked for life. Not only was I hooked but Chicago became a hockey town again thanks to Rocky Wirtz. Chicago lives and dies by the Hawks again and that is freaking amazing. We are all in on this team and it cant feel any better.But anyways looking forward to the future our window is wide open. Toews and Kane will get their longterm contracts this offseason. We got the core of Toews Kane Keith Seabrook Hammer Sharp Hossa Crawford locked in for the next several years and once players like Hossa and Seabrook start getting old and worn out we got phenom studs like Tuevo Time and Stephen Johns coming in to replace them and adding to the core Also hope we can resign Saad. Almost every franchise in hockey wants to be us. The Wings wish they had our talent. The Blues despite their great talent wish they were us. The Canucks LOL....etc. Our talent pool is unbelievable and the future is still bright. It sucks we didnt win this year but well be back next year Chelsea Dagger will be blaring and well be back to kicking ass and taking names. Toews will raise the cup again multiple times in the future and I can almost guarantee it. Blackhawks are the truth. Blackhawks are life. Blackhawks are love. ALL IN. ,hawks,chy13xj,3,t5_2rhes

The big screen was constantly playing short  second videos making fun of the Hawks and their wejustscored song is partially them chanting you suck! several times over. Granted thats true for anyone they play not just us. Their efforts to reduce the red in the arena so to speak didnt work at all. I would say at least  of the people there were Hawks fans. There was red everywhere and we were pretty damn loud when we scored. I did get amused when they kept chanting CRAWFORD every time they scored though.I mean truth be told Ive only been to  NHL arenas other than the UC so I dont know if the negative videos and whatnot are commonplace elsewhere. Nevertheless one of the things Ive always liked about the Blackhawks is that our fans rarely ever attack the other team.

2422947,0,t1_cmb3n2t,gtI once interviewed him for a job for the N.S.A I told him why he should work for us but got shot down heres his quote exactlyWhy should I work for the N.S.A.? Thats a tough one but Ill take a shot. Say Im working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk something nobody else can break. Maybe I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And Im real happy with myself cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never met never had no problem with get killed. Now the politicians are sayin Oh send in the Marines to secure the area cause they dont give a shit. It wont be their kid over there gettin shot. Just like it wasnt them when their number got called cause they were pullin a tour in the National Guard. Itll be some kid from Southie takin shrapnel in the ass. And he comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job cause hell work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile he realizes the only reason he was over there in the first place was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them but it aint helping my buddy at twofifty a gallon. And theyre takin their sweet time bringin the oil back of course and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis and fuckin play slalom with the icebergs and it aint too long til he hits one spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So now my buddys out of work and he cant afford to drive so hes got to walk to the fuckin job interviews which sucks cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile hes starvin cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate special theyre servin is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State. So what did I think? Im holdin out for somethin better. I figure fuck it while Im at it why not just shoot my buddy take his job give it to his sworn enemy hike up gas prices bomb a village club a baby seal hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard?

4266934,0,t1_cs6klp6,Yeah. There are still a whole bunch of hockey fans that get hung up on the idea of needing an established goalie. Sooner or later people have to realize the team in front of the goalie is more important. As far as goaltending goes in the NHLAHL there are a very select few goalies who year in year out are at the top and a whoooolllllle bunch of guys who more or less go as their team goes and have cold and hot streaks. Thats why you see things like a Michael Leighton backstopped Philly team making the Final or in this series a kid like Vasilevsky coming in and playing indistinguishable from a veteran whos had years under his belt instead of just  games for his entire pro career. The difference between most goalies at the NHLAHL level is simply opportunity and the lack thereof. There are only ever  starting spots in the league. Hell weve seen it here with Darling in the st round against Nashville they won a Cup with Niemi. When you have a team like this you dont need  million tied up in net just because you cant get over the idea that a goalie who isnt established is going to be a weak spot. I dont understand how as Hawks fans weve all seen it happen to the contrary to the point of winning the Cup and a lot of us still cant grasp that it really doesnt matter nearly as much as people say it does. ,hawks,cs6lnzu,1,t5_2rhes

4774104,0,t1_ctw5r9d,Please allow me to vent with you. I read this article yesterday and multiple times again today to process it. To put it mildly I do not like this article. And its not because I am a propagator of Rape Culture who believes Kanes hockey career is more important than the alleged victim as this author seems to be throwing at every single person who criticizes him in any way. First his explanation of Rape Culture can be summed up in a tumblr gif. He provides some examples of actions he sees as contributing rape culture but does no analysis on how or why that is. Just pointing and yelling rape culture! at someones action doesnt educate anybody. Second he portrays only  possible reactions. Either you completely detach yourself from any emotional connection you had with the Hawks or you are an emotional superfan contributing to rape culture. Many of Blackhawks fans are somewhere in between and will obviously feel more of a connection with him than the mugshot a total stranger and are feeling conflicted. That doesnt automatically make any of us blind to the possibility Kane could be guilty. And lastly how does pointing out innocent until proven guilty make anybody a propagator of rape culture? Its a factual statement. The onus is on the prosecution to make a case beyond reasonable doubt. Its not unbalanced its an integral part of due process. There is a very good reason why the criminal justice system operates that way. Sorry for the long rant. ,hawks,ctwbh1x,13,t5_2rhes

How many games would the KanePanarinAnisimov line suffer the letdown and how many nights might they not get their  pointsor even as a result of that lost morale.

Our possessionshot numbers are significantly down. We give up more high quality chances. Our PK has been good but has been better in recent years. Our power play has been awesome but its covering up for some mediocre  on  production that is a better predictor of playoff success. People want to point to years past but look at our top  from those seasons compared to now hell we had bollandKrugerfrolic as the th line in . And no Oduya in the top  which was critical last year. Hossa is older we have a ton of new guys. We cant just rely on eh theyve been through this before because the truth is half this team hasnt. Dont get me wrong we still have a real shot. But we honestly need both a top line winger and a th dman. And well hopefully at least get the former.

7601612,0,t3_4jefdr,Id like to see Teuvo at RW for an extended period to start the season. If you keep putting him on lines with guys like Mashinter and Desjardins youre never going to see what hes capable of offensively. Put him in a position to succeed playing with Toews and see if he can do it. If he can then he boosts his value to the team and he also boosts his trade value if they cant afford to keep him.It would be shortsighted to give up on a yearold because he had a few rough games against the Blues or because he didnt score as much when put in a defensive role. Hell never be a physical player but he can get better at compensating for that and I do think he has more to contribute to the team.

7885295,0,t3_4mu908,Teuvo is young but so far hasnt lived up to the potential.  He is small in stature and has been avoiding hits which makes him less than effective when challenged physically.  He may grow into a top player and seemingly has the talent to do so but will he and in what time frame is the question. Shaw by all measures even his own has out performed the expectations of his potential.  He has been a key part of the depth on the Hawks for several years playing multiple roles on multiple lines and scoring roughly  ptsyr the same as Teuvo.  Now I am not saying that Shaw has anywhere near the upside of Teuvo but he has been a large part of the team success over the last three years.  People like to call out his bad penalties and yes he led the team in penalty minutes but isnt that what you expect from a scrappy  dogged player who gets to the net.  Last year he was th in shots and th in points for perspective Teuvo was th in both.I put those stats in there because there seems to be two sides in the argument Teuvo is better than Shaw or vice versa.  Teuvo has potential to be better in scoring no doubt.  Shaw is proven to be a great depth utility player.  If we are in a win now mode than Shaw is the one to keep.  If we are building for a run in a year or two than Teuvo has more value.Personally I value Shaw more as you can see in the bias in my writing.,hawks,d42dos3,3,t5_2rhes

10346201,0,t1_dcgsif2,I guess its not so much that they are getting spotlight though I do think they are going A BIT overboard with all the Matthews stuff but more so people are acting like this particular play is so godlike and nobody has ever done something like this before but yet Panarin did it last year and nobody cared. And I guess it kind of bothers me that there are still a sizable number of people who act like Panarin is a product of Kane and wont admit hes actually a fantastic player on his own merit. So it was more so the combination of everyone circlejerking over Matthews in contrast to Panarin who I still feel is underrated among the hockey fandom in comparison to other young Russian studs like Tarasenko or Kucherov.,hawks,dcgsun9,4,t5_2rhes

Im not blind either I do remember last year with Ladd and what a waste those moves were! Maybe its just me being too scared of another situation where a rookie makes some mistake that costs us the series. Like Gustafssons turnover last year that led to the series clynching goal by Brouwer. I also feel like we are going to miss that onearm warrior on the back end thats gonna save us from a couple goals. I speak of course about an Oduya kind of guy like when we won vs the Lightning.

10933973,0,t1_de7pmun,Shalunov is reportedly not very likely to come over unless he gets a really sizable role. Like probably a Top  role so he can achieve bonuses the only way he ends up making more money than he does in the KHL now. I hate to break up the top two lines when theyre so hot. But Im gonna humor myself and let the imagine run wildSchmaltz  Toews  KanePanarin  Anisimov  ShalunovJurco  Kruger  HossaMooseHino  Kero  Hartman I just love the idea of having our own pure Russian line. Plus Shalunovs preferred position is RW. The fact that it gets Kane and Toews together is just an added bonus. And if Jurco can play like his rookie days I think that third line could really gel. Heres hoping hes the next Panik and a change of scenery was all he needed. Fourth line is more or less the same. Theres just so many options down there. I really do think Hartman deserves a bigger role on this team. So if Jurco doesnt work our Id actually love to see a bottom six of Hartman  Kruger  HossaRasmussen  Kero  HinostrozaI just have a hard time sending any of the rookies down. Hino being down in Rockford breaks my heart. But I do wish the best for Jurco. I actually think hes a good pickup.

At just G and Pts this season he isnt the valuable topline scorer that we are used to that typically fetches a huge deadlineday haul.  Waiving Tootoo until the playoffs gives enough deadline cap space to take his hit with the Stars holding some retention.  Sharp as a depthscorer rather than Desi Vinnie or Rasmussen would be a huge add for a playoff run if they can get him at the right price.With that addition a playoff lineup looks something likeSchmaltz  Toews  PanikBread  Anisimov  KaneHartman  Kero  SharpDealersChoice Probably Rasmussen defensively Kruger  Hossa,hawks,deb0hcs,1,t5_2rhes

Hes not worth that much to us but I believehope he will realize hes been waived by like  or  teams and this is the only place hes seen success. I think he asks for a modest raise and we get him between . mil which I think would be good.
