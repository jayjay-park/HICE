It goes from Bulmer Hobson down to the rank and file and has members from Cumann na mBn and the Irish Citizen Army.

869866,0,t3_240syy,Thats because Merry Ploughboy was adapted with very few changes to the tune of an old British marching song The Scarlet and the Blue also sometimes the Jolly Ploughboy which dates to the s before the lobsters changed to khaki. For whatever its worth the song in the play is definitively called The Scarlet and the Blue as seen hereDuring WW the Royal Horse Artillery was particularly fond of their version of the song and their ...off to join the RHA... would become IRA in the later Behan version.,IrishHistory,ch35phv,2,t5_2tlyg
893895,0,t3_24bflo,Cant say specifically about the annals of ulster but in the annals of the four masters the same events often appear in the same or slightly different forms credited with different dates. This was explained to me as being because of the nature of communications at the time. Stories would travel but would take time to get from place to place so by the time one scholar hears and records it months or years may have passed whereas another scholar would have heard and recorded it immediately. Histories like that cant really give you specific dates unless there is something else historically verifiable in the text,IrishHistory,ch5w1tu,2,t5_2tlyg

2068072,0,t3_2ijl3y,gtThis came as a major shock to King James I and the Crown Government not least because ODoherty was known as The Queens ODoherty. And just to give you a sense of ODohertys friendship  or so it seemed  with the English Government that at the very time in fact a matter of months before the rebellion the youthful Sir Cahir ODoherty was actually engaged in a scheme to become a member of the Prince of Wales household. So this is a person this is a leading member of the leading Irish aristocracy who was seeking to assimilate himself with the English system and yet this was the man who led this dramatic revolt in Derry in April .,IrishHistory,cl2p499,2,t5_2tlyg

2084044,0,t1_cl447vz,For a rundown of the Tin I suggest Wikipedia. The Tuatha D were gods. Tuatha D means tribe of the gods and Tuatha D Danann means tribe of the godess Danu or Anu who is a mysterious figure that there are a number of theories on. The gods were fairies and many fairies were gods but I dont think that every fairy ever mentioned was actively worshipped. Now not the Victorian little winged fairies mind  those were distortions that had occurred over time. The Tuatha D often transformed themselves into birds which must have eventually led to the winged thing.,IrishHistory,cl4q7fv,1,t5_2tlyg
2105346,0,t1_cl7an55,The question regarding Irish Catholics officers in the British army is a difficult enough one to answer and I might broaden it out slightly if you dont mind. During the latter half of the nineteenth century the Irish as a proportion of people in the UK declined that impacted on the numbers serving in the military. There was a certain urban  rural divide in terms of enlistment as well where enlistment in the Army attracted a certain amount of negativity. It should also be remembered that the classes that would have provided officers would have had a disproportionate number of Protestants which would have impacted on the numbers of Catholic officers. That doesnt mean that you didnt have Irish Catholics at all levels of the Army. Catholic members of the gentry served at a senior level obviously. Like any other part of the UK poorer people populated the lower ranks regardless of their religion and for urban people regardless of religion it was an attractive enough career. ,IrishHistory,cl7fom7,5,t5_2tlyg

5371224,0,t1_cvy0ae4,gtIn  Bridget joined her son on a tour of the United States where he was invited to lecture on his infamous uncle. They decided to stay and Bridget wrote a manuscript My BrotherinLaw Adolf in which she claimed that her famous brotherinlaw had moved to Liverpool to live with Bridget and Alois from November  to April  to dodge conscription in his native Austria. She claims that she introduced Adolf to astrology and that she advised him to trim off the edges of his moustache.gtShe was initially unable to sell the manuscript and most historians dismiss the work as being a fabrication written in an attempt to cash in on her famous relation. Brigitte Hamann and Hans Mommsen say that records prove that Hitler was in Vienna during this period.gtThere is no corroborating evidence Hitler ever visited his relatives in Liverpool. Professor Robert Waite refutes her claims that Adolf Hitler had stayed with her as well as most of the rest of her book in the appendix to his book The Psychopathic God Adolf Hitler.Source Honestly what is the point of this subreddit?

Neither Dennis OBrien nor the government should have a monopoly on the media. Concentration of media in one set of hands public or private stifles the freedom of the press. Take that quote and swap a word or two and it is still valid.gtnor will the confidence of independent organs in Dennis OBriens news be restored by the knowledge that such news reaches them only after passing through a professionally staffed propaganda department.,IrishHistory,ddkn4is,1,t5_2tlyg
