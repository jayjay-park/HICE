10161596,0,t3_5lgho4,For most hackathon the resume is only used to give to sponsors. One of the reasons sponsors sponsor hackathons is because they get to do recruiting there.  The hackathon it self doesnt really look at the resume or use it to decide if you get in or not. I would just use a resume that youd use for a CS company.
