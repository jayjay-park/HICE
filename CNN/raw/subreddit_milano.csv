4535504,0,t3_3d52cu,I love Milan but this one is hard! Not a great time choice you made  Lets try anyway. First of all you need good bowel resistance since youll frequently go from hot outside to places with AC. Then youll better not be lactose intolerant since youll need plenty of gelato. Grom stores have good gelato and spawn across the city. If youre near one Gelateria della Musica definitely go there. I also love Lo Gnomo Gelato. Sorry no links Im from mobile. If youre strolling or shopping near pizza Duomo corso Vittorio Emanuele corso Buenos Aires piazza San Babila there are some large book shops La Feltrinelli and Mondadori theres AC there and often a cafeteria inside. They have comfortable seats for customers and visitors you can chill a bit there. La Rinascente is a fancy megastore near Duomo if youre into fashion or design peek there and go to the attic for a drink. If you like eating and drinking look for Eataly world famous good food indoor so air conditioned. I leave to others suggestions about pools never tried anything but I sometimes go to the local spa Terme Milano. If you like spas thats a nice one. There are of course small pools not to swim but to relax of course. Theres also an old tram converted to sauna but for . euros you can take a regular tram and have a sauna there too. One nice indoor experience is Dialogo nel Buio where youll discover what it means to be a blind person amazing check it out. Museums are another indoor activity I recommend Museo delle Scienze e della Tecnica and Museo del Novecento. Biggest park is Parco Sempione if youll visit then Castle youll find it. Castle also has a large fountain in front where you can get a bit of restoration. If youre going to Navigli for Aperitivo or Happy Hour maybe you want to have some juicy fruit before theres a nice covered market nearby in the new Darsena area. Ask for a sweet mango they have spectacular ones. How youll eat it I dont know... Finally maybe a good beer will help you get some minerals back I highly suggest La Belle Alliance near Navigli or Birrificio di Lambrate. Have a nice stay and ask if you have any question! Edit forgot about annoying mosquitos expecially in the evening while youd like to have a drink get some Autan in a pharmacy or supermarket! ,milano,ct2bz6r,2,t5_2r0t8

8691543,0,t3_4z0ygo,Via Conchetta? Thats close to NavigliDarsena a very well known night life area. Prices for groceries dont vary a lot between areas of the city but they do for coffee shops and clothes stores. For electrical and water bills Milan costs more than other smaller towns in Lombardia.You can download movies without any problem.I dont known any clothing outlet but there are a few scattered around the city.,milano,d6s2l4g,3,t5_2r0t8
