Its nice to see it having a role again for people who want to play the game like that.Otherwise I just ran my usual loadout. MIDA on big maps Strangers Rifle on small ones Secret Handshake Jolders Hammer. The early going of a heavy ammo drop is sketchy as hell with all the rockets but MGs are still usable. Finished around . after  games. Thorn still needs reigned in though. The range is simply too long. Hand cannons as an archetype should have like maybe double TLWs range tops.

3801469,0,t1_cqp801t,Well then I outright disagree with blink camo and sticky nades being banned. Invisibilty only minimizes you radar prescence and makes you slightly harder to see. Also no radar to test players teamwork and ability to remain aware.  Sticky nades are annoying yet are pretty inconsistent so I dont see them being used by competitive players that much anyways. Blink is debatable  Im not saying it isnt one of the best jump modifiers for pvp but if this is banned it opens the door for eliminating subclasses and classes entirely. I mean any customization makes people believe some options are overpowered so the only way to balance the classes in destiny once and for all would be to eliminate them for competitive play. For weapons they would have to offer everyone the same white quality guns to use because legendaries and even blues and greens can have extremely strong perk sets. For armor it couldnt have any perks other than maybe stat bonuses to intellect discipline and strength. But then again would this really be destiny then? I mean at the end of the day we have to accept that destiny was a game oriented towards casual players and will probably not have a perfect competitive mode in the foreseeable future. Maybe in future installments in the series.,CruciblePlaybook,cqplis8,1,t5_37lup

The question is how much more damage does the impact boost on Aggressive Ballistics add compared to High Caliber? Is it enough reap the benefits of additional impact? Is the maintained range a more efficient use of higher impact since there is less fall off? These are things I havent been able to test but Im currently not concerned with the lack of stability yet.

3978468,0,t1_cr90dxs,I feel like high caliber rounds work better and better against weapons that require more and more range. For example they are useless against shotguns which is pretty obvious. They are slightly less useless against hand cannons as youve stated youve experienced this. The effect goes up and up the farther you get. Pulse rifles will jerk enough to disrupt triple headshots. Good luck landing headshots with a scout rifle and finally anyone who has tried sniping someone shooting you with MIDA is hilariously difficult.

At worst Hopscotch Pilgrim with its superior base stats would be analog to Messenger assuming you had the right perks. At a hypothetical best with the higher ancillary base stats Aim Assist  larger hit box stability equip time reload mag size you can have a more powerful weapon.Perfect Balance even with Red Dot is not enough to provide full stability on The Messenger. Braced Frame is enough to max out Stability on Hopscotch even with Sureshot. The stability and superior Aim Assist gives the user an easier time when attempting to score the . head shot TTK. Even if you dont go with Braced Frame youll have plenty of flexibility in rolling different combinations.The Messenger is an extremely capable weapon and does have a superior range stat but the difference is rather negligible plus it looks frickin sweet. Stats aside however I think the static Third Eye perk is its Achilles heel. Third Eye can be very effective at elevating the game of the more average player but it is a crutch perk. Players should be frequently backing off their sights for map knowledge and mobility. Learning the read the radar and properly anticipating is a skill that should be identified and practiced and I feel Third Eye takes away from exercising that skill. I feel if the skill of the player is developed enough in this area a different perk in this slot would make a world of difference for its ability to kill.,CruciblePlaybook,crwjp5t,1,t5_37lup

4316788,0,t3_3aektm,As others have stated it depends on what you consider to be worthwhile.  In my case I consider myself a pretty average PVPer .ish KD.  I didnt start streaming to show off my gunskillz it just seemed like a cool way for me to use a social game to meet and play with new people.  Almost all of my stream time is spent playing with viewers of ALL skill levels and Ive made a bunch of online friends that I now play regularly with.  We usually peak at about  concurrent viewers but I always manage to have fun interacting with whoever shows up to chat andor play.Honestly I think a lot of viewers just like to play with someone who is streaming pretty much regardless of the streamers skill level.  If you build your stream around a theme of playing with the viewer community you will find new people quite often jumping in and immediately asking if they can join even though theyve never seen you play once.I would suggest that before you ever start streaming you spend some time on Twitch watching various streams deciding what you do and dont like determine whether or not you even like the platform and try to come to a conclusion on what you would want the purpose of your channel to be.,CruciblePlaybook,csc89mt,2,t5_37lup

4341863,0,t1_csf0vdm,Lets use Sneakys Fun Scale SFS to determine the overall winner here. SFS has been used for centuries as the most comprehensive and statistically correct measurement of fun so it seems to be the obvious choice here.Nova bomb is good stuff I agree there. Can be used to great effect for instant team wiping and shutdowns. Though it can also be fully wasted. Overall  on the Sneaky Fun Scale compared to Radiance. Spamming Op nades and slapping fools is fun but dat Space Magic doe.Axion Bolt is just not for me. A bit too slow in every way. Can be easily outrun and even if they dont run it still takes a second to detonate track reach target and do some dmg. Always makes me sad when used compared to Firebolt.  on the Sneaky Fun Scale. Firebolt can make people run as well but at least they are running away while burning down to little or no health. Blink aka Voids saving grace. Want to get somewhere fast? Want to appear on the other side of something dangerous? Want to have trouble with jumping a short to medium distance? Blink is where its at.  on the SFS.Void slap is not too bad. Can life steal can improve speed can increase super gained. At least it has options. Fireslap is just for shields. Shiled is good but shield not fun by itself. Kills are fun though and shield can help with kills.  for melee on Sneakys Fun Scale.Overall this puts Void at a  on the SFS. Clearly more fun that Sunsinger no way to argue that anymore. As for conistency in ToO though I think Sunsinger still has the upper hand in most scenarios. ToO is no place for mercy or fun it seems.

Its a fun weapon to mess around with but dont expect to get very many kills with it regardless of what perks youre using.That said I use Send It on mine and switch between sights depending on whether the map lends itself to longrange sniping or midrange roaming.

Ive never made it to the lighthouse but Im usually able to at least buy the weapon for sale. Not this week though. The most I could string together with these LFG folks was  wins including boons on one ticket. I was thinking to myself that maybe all the folks who arent good at crucible have just sworn it off forever so Im the new player everyone wants to be paired against from here on out but after really thinking about my best tickets in weeks past it took my teams and I at least three cards to start playing cohesively.

Ive noticed that nearly  my kills on my newer bubble Titan are Shotgun kills mainly because others play style has forced me to learn to pull that thing out more frequently.

4476531,0,t3_3cf4ch,Personally I dont wait until they are standing completely straight up.  More often than not when I do this they manage to jump up and I miss the head shot.  Im definitely not fast enough to hit them before they hit the ground...jeez.What I do instead to a much greater success rate is aim for their head as they are standing up. That is when someone is revived they initially crouch down and then stand straight up. They can only move once they are standing completely up. However their immunity is gone as they as standing up. So you aim your scope to between two heights crouching down and standing straight up.  As soon as they start moving up take the shot and let AA do the work. I dont think Ive ever missed doing it like this.  Hope that helps.,CruciblePlaybook,csuxq7u,4,t5_37lup

Furthermore subclass perks and weapon perks sometimes dont load properly. When this happens quickdraw wont work radiance just wont do anything when activated apart from make you glow no damage resistance or accelerated cooldowns TLW wont fire as fast as it should and all sorts of guns with barrel upgrades sometimes wont do proper damage. To fix this unequip and reequip the subclass perk or weapon. It wont always fix it the first time and the glitch may reappear.

4717022,0,t1_ctp3mcf,Im definitely being combative. I might have slipped into condescending. Sorry about that.Im responding to what I see in your posts and pointing out how your actions might bring about a response in the people around you. Part of it coming across as condescending may be due to the fact that you havent painted a complete picture so I can only assume that the whole situation includes what youve reported. It would really help to have a recording between the two of you in the middle of a match to really suss out whats happeningFor example you dont have a recording for us to review so all that I have to go on is the fact that you chose to focus on his mistakes. It makes me assume that you do the same with your friend. When I try and suggest you change yourself you get defensive though thats probably my delivery since I did get a annoyed with your original post.I know you youre in here asking for tips on how to talk to him but dont misconstrue. You are in here asking for ways to encourage him to change his gameplay and win more consistently in Trials. If you just wanted a different way to talk to him then you would have accepted your winloss rate after you created a more relaxed environment to play in.Getting a friend to change is a different beast altogether especially when youre attempting to get them to work at their game. Its not always a matter of skill but a matter of priority. He just might not care that much about getting better at Trials. Im willing to bet that if you pressure the point hell say that he wants to improve in order to appease you. That doesnt mean it will help the situation though. Its more likely to frustrate the two of you even further.,CruciblePlaybook,ctp4ar5,1,t5_37lup
4718009,0,t1_ctozy9x, firebolts is   .  Thats  which is not an instant kill against anyone running max armor.  To put it into perspective running gift of the sun gives you a max potential of  damage and thats provided you do hit with both grenades.  You dont get touch of flame which is the perk that makes grenades apply a burn.  Running ToF and VK gives you a SINGLE firebolt grenade that does  initial plus an additional  over seconds shutting shields down on your opponent for that seconds and dealing  total damage to the enemy.  So you get an extra  damage that will only kill someone not running max armor.  And thats all you get for running with gift of the sun.

Cauldron for all its flaws has a lot of escape routes so look to them if youre getting pinched. Better to live to fight another day than get teamshots giving away a kill and assist to the other team.  know when to switch weapons. You get caught out a few times by shotguns at close range where you still have your pulse out. Likewise there is a point where a Titan kills you with messenger where youre about a blink and a half away trying to shoot him with a shottie.

4735931,0,t1_ctrge6n,But Secret HandshakeTTTM are objectively worse than the Felwinters tier. The reason preHoW weapons are not so common are because . People dismantled many and . They arent rerollable. I still use preHoW IB items like Felwinters and Jolders Hammer because I can reroll them for good perks. Bungie may well introduce things that will make them obsolete  maybe new weapons will have twice as much aim assist or a better perk pool or maybe the new meta will revolve around double katana rogues. But for the moment thats all speculation. And if the general structure of acquiring gear is the same then I cant imagine a lot of grind thats required in PvE. It certainly gives you a better chance for say exotics and such but right now the best PvEonly weapons I can think of are Hopscotch Pilgrim and thats just because its rerollable while the Messenger is not and Her BenevolenceShadow of Veils.

Most maps have keys that once youve gotten your hold on the positioning with a little communication you stay there sniping Im going to hold them tight at this choke point you can essentially end a match when its only  mins old and  to . Playing solo as Im sure you know means you have to be a solid jack of all trades able to look and assess your teams strengths and weaknesses within the first  seconds of a match and become the gap filler to do what needs to be done that no one else is doing. You may be a fantastic sniper but if your team has three morons already standing next to each other sniping you dont need one more. So you have to go forward and cap points.

4765359,0,t3_3g64p1,Well first off dont play Control and Clash.  Never was there a more random rageinducing game mode.  If you lose in s its because you got blindsided or abandoned by your five random teammates  if you lose in Skirmish its because you got outplayed fair and square.  ButI just dont have the wiring in me to get angry  momentarily frustrated maybe but it just doesnt click in my head to get angry.Im playing a GAME.  Its FUN.  There would be no reason to play it if it werent those things.  To take something you enjoy and that you volunteered to do and throw a tantrum over it?  I dont get it.What I can say is that when I first starting playing Crucible I found it INTENSE.  Even your basic Control match was highadrenaline heart racing palm sweating.  For me that translates into focus but for you maybe that translates into anger.  Either way  that intense feeling goes away over time.  You just get used to it  the highs and the lows level out.I suggest you start recording and watching your matches because what youll find is those rageinducing moments are almost entirely your fault  you got sniped because you walked out.  You got shotgunned because you werent watching your radar.  You got teamshot because you didnt work with your teammates even if they were randos.Ive talked to a lot of top players on the podcast and the thing I hear over and over is that they dont worry about how everyone else played  they worry about how they played.  If they die it was their fault and instead of getting angry they start analyzing what happened so they dont do it again.,CruciblePlaybook,ctv7uaw,2,t5_37lup

It sounds like well have to cower and wait even longer because were waiting on the countdown from the last shot instead of the first. I imagine it will probably increase the number of times the burn finishes you off too.I could be wrong though Im sure they are more than capable of introducing another PVP breaking exotic in the next DLC.

4876949,0,t3_3hok05,Im not gonna go second by second because someone else hopefully will and you can watch moment to moment and see your own mistakes. There are two things I want to point out that will totally help you automatically.  You really like to aim down sights. You do it with all weapons including a rocket launcher that doesnt need it but this really comes into play when youre using The Last Word a gun with an exotic perk that relies on firing from the hip. In extremely close ranges aiming down sights impairs your ability to follow a target and many times you would have easily cleaned up an enemy had you simply used the fullautohipfire beauty of TLW. Your commitment to the objective should be appreciated but in this game it wont be. Youre my favorite guardian to kill in control because you cant seem to resist the zone . Sprinting right to B and trying to cap at the top of the match will ensure that someone gets a First Blood medal by killing you. And throughout the game you really hunker down on those zones even when youre absolutely surrounded. Learning when to back off from a fight run from a Sunsinger and give up a zone will make a huge difference and youll see it in your Kd. Its OK to run away!I really think these two things are just habits you need to develop but will help your game tremendously. Thanks for posting!

4997231,0,t1_cuoba58,The funny thing about those higher impact pulses is that  of the time its going to require  bursts to kill an enemy. When you take that into account I actually found the timepiece to have a BETTER TTK in the mid range than most of the higher impact pulses Ive used. Sure you can hit those two burst kills with the messenger and it feels great but that rarely happens against skilled players who are aware. Chances are they will be shooting back enough that it will cause your recoil to miss that perfect two burst. And with the OAS dot sight I found the Timepieces recoil to be extremely manageable. In fact theres almost no recoil at all. I like that it helps me practice better aiming because the gun requires mostly headshots to do any amount of damage.

5004925,0,t1_cuoihy4,gt ook at my response to LuxSolisPax above. My criticism for exercise  is that no sprinting makes things ludicrously difficult because spawns flip so often in this game and you will often be out of any reasonable engagement. Will this show you how valuable watching other players and enemy team movements are? MaybeYou sort of answered your own question there chap. Thats EXACTLY what its for.The spawns flip so frequently BECAUSE people sprint they do not control the spawn wave and knowing where the enemy is is  of the way to killing them.,CruciblePlaybook,cupa58r,1,t5_37lup

Did some dragons with some friends this week and the damn gun dropped for the random who joined them immediately after I left SOB!!!!!.  I hate the grind.Nevertheless Im not stopping now.  And I think odds are still in your favor.   guns on dragon loot table.  Seems like one drops every  strikes or so.

Blink isnt very suited to these maps so Ive gone with the Bones and controlled jump on my Bladedancer. MIDA is the perfect gun for rift as it offers the crazy agility boost. Its also really suited to the long site lines in most rift maps.For TLW Im finding that the aggressive ballistics nerf and range nerf are meaning that in many situations you need an extra bullet to finish people off. Im getting enemies down to a slither of their health its missing a bit of impact.Surprising to see so little of Thorn in v and rumble havent played any v. I think most people are tired of it and are trying out other guns. It will probably make a comeback as its still really good.Blink shotgun still works.,CruciblePlaybook,cuvgtli,2,t5_37lup

5067535,0,t3_3kejkv,Thorn is still decent with one of the more competitive TTK ingame .. Also the DoT is still useful for tracking people. Furthermore bodyshots now kill just as fast as headshots so you barely have to aim.TLW is still a solid competitor in CQC but youll need to really control your engagement range. ARs have begun cutting into its territory so it might not be viable soon.Red Death is fantastic. It sports one of the better TTKs and most useful exotic perk. Its also coming to Year ! Its always been a strong gun and now it is one of the best.Messenger is great and I predict it along with its other  brethren to be the new meta. Requiring less precision than Red Deathallfate archetypes it kills in only .s more. It also doesnt have issues with armour unlike the next archetype. Solid choice all around. Scout Rifles are once again slightly better but still uncommon. Receiving virtually no buffs Thorn and PR changes make them more viable at range. Still their TTK is slow and theyre pretty bad within  meters.ARs are viable but not meta competitors IMO. Some plus sides are ease of use and staggering but drawbacks include short effective range dont engage outside of  meters slow TTK around .s and a need for constant precision hits to lower an already high TTK. Suros in TK may be much better with spooling up as that will improve TTK along with fixing Focused Fire DPS loss. ,CruciblePlaybook,cuwtv9l,14,t5_37lup

5073093,0,t1_cuxdqbr,On paper The Messenger is better but I feel the Red Death has overall more effectiveness. Your points on TTK and range are correct but the Red Death has better Mid Tier perks. Snapshot is great as it gives you the jump on any gunfight I cant speak on High Caliber Rounds as I dont use them but the biggest advantage the Red Death has imo is Single Point Sling it helps strafing which is a huge advantage in this meta and you can switch weapons faster which helps both snipers and shotgunners get their shots.So while the Messenger wins in the TTK and range I wouldnt say its strictly superior as the Red Death pulls your setup more closely together more with SPS and allows you to engage in more gunfights with its health regen.,CruciblePlaybook,cuxi027,1,t5_37lup
5075674,0,t1_cuxpzkg,If you could roll spare change for a high stability perk such as braced frame and maybe go for rodeo and hidden hand it would be comparable to the messenger.

It would be cool if you could make a testing video testing out the TTK against a Hunter going full Armor and medium Recovery versus full Recovery and medium Armor. If there is no difference there then the only reason to keep going max Armor is to survive Tripmine Grenades and if thats the case I think there arent enough Gunslingers throwing Tripmines to make it worth it more than nearly  seconds faster shield recovery.,CruciblePlaybook,cv1lz06,1,t5_37lup

With the Blinkshotgun meta that was around previously the range was the shotguns range  the range of the blink. Now its just the shotgun range and that is all.Also Bungie need to just get rid of any shotgun that has more impact than Found VerdictJudgment. Its a bad idea because a the shotguns still actually fire pretty fast and b they just deal way too much damage especially against super users. I currently use a perfectly rolled Judgment and a majority of the time I will need to follow up with a melee or two shot someone unless I am very close to them.Another thing seldom mentioned is the Aggressive Ballistics nerf which basically makes it do nothing on shotguns at all. I can understand why its an issue on FelwintersMatador but on something like Found Verdict the result is that you struggle to get the OHK even within melee range even when the target is right next to you because you need to hit  pellets instead of  to get the kill.Basically all what Im saying is that given how a majority of TK shotguns are not of the extremeimpact archetype dont make a majority of shotguns suffer because some genius decided that a shotgun should have the most impact and range in the game. Found Verdictarchetype shotguns and those of any impact lower than that are fine.,CruciblePlaybook,cvemah0,3,t5_37lup
5217752,0,t3_3mh99p,i checked your destiny tracker and first thing I checked is your total play time in pvp you have only  hours of playtime in pvp. Ok are you expecting to out play people who have s of pvp game time ?  my point is just play more pvp and you will get better with time. There is honestly no point of giving tips now because you are still new to pvp  so its ok to suck little bit trust me dont be hard on ur self. ,CruciblePlaybook,cvexjli,33,t5_37lup
5229359,0,t1_cvg8k3d,thanks for your response. Care to explain what do you mean with trends and lifetime? I would love to try out sweaties vs good pvp players but there is no lfg site i am aware off. The nd problem is im from Europe and all the pvp players on twitch like invicta or bellazy you name it are usbased.Regarding your walk more  challenge less point I used to walk around my comfort zone on certain maps alot and it basically gave me free kills. There is only one problem IMO by walking around you are exposed on the enemy radar alot longer. I tried to sprintslide and challenge and i suffered. Most of the time i got killed. After this i evolved my playstyle. Now im having a mixture of walking and challenging. This means most of the time i try to engage and i see if i can win the gunfight or lose. If i loose i just back out immediatly as a titan its pretty easy to backskate and if im likely to win ill go aggressive. With this being said it only works if im having my good games edit sorry if i sound confusing im not a native english speaker,CruciblePlaybook,cvgbupp,1,t5_37lup
5238137,0,t1_cvhd7x6,I highly recommend using it a lot like TLW like I said above in fact my other favorite build is sniper with TLW. Backing up on shotgun rushers unload like a panicking maniac into the chest or people who are a little closer  on the midrange taking timed shots like a higher rate of fire HC. I like how you can take shots while moving Its easy to hit people while jumping in the air which makes me feel like in my opinion that side arms are in a more comfortable place than fusion rifles.I love battle runner but I am really interested to see how hot swap and rangefinder meld together let me know how you like it Id appreciate the info!,CruciblePlaybook,cvhdw0j,1,t5_37lup

And if you have to focus on something to be negative about critique yourself. Focus on what you can be working on. If your teammates were dying too much why werent you there to cover them more? If your opponents keep team shotting you why do you keep putting yourself in that position for that to happen? Lastly force yourself to send your opponents messages of GG.

Smart drift control gives more predictable recoil which is advantageous in that your recoil is more manageable in the sideways directions keeping your aim more or less from the neck to the top of the head.

5429754,0,t1_cw5o5fn,Youve killed  people with one hammer? Ive killed  people with one golden gun shot I dont say golden gun is op because I faced bad players.The hit box being huge as you state is actually a combination of the tracking proximity detonation and splash damage. Youre right that Sunbreakers dont need a direct hit. Its far easier to instead aim at the feet so the splash kills them. Without the platform or wall for the hammer to strike its far easier to miss. Thats the entire reason why jumping and staying airborne works against sunbreakers. The hit box itself isnt as large as you stated but because of the splash it makes it seem like it is. A good sunbreaker will often aim at your feet and when you jump will wait and aim where youre going to land this is because it is too easy to miss an airborne target which wouldnt be the case if the hit box and tracking was as easy as you claim. A direct hit is a kill and the splash can kill but there is a range at which youll take damage from the splash but survive. So not everything is a OHK. Someone else in this thread posted a video of himself throwing  hammers. If you watch it he doesnt stop throwing hammers at any point. The only reason this works in that video is because the opposing team just keeps running into him as he throws.  hammers is possible with non stop throwing. If your opponents arent idiots and you arent in a hallway with only  entrances one of which you just came from youll more likely only get  hammers,CruciblePlaybook,cw5pgcp,4,t5_37lup

5440385,0,t1_cw57atc,Copying this from down below in the comments so it could be more visible in case people visit this thread in the future.Id just like to remind everybody of the niche that Fusions hold and they are indeed that a niche weapon.They one hit kill well outside shotgun range but at anything over a solid medium range they should not be used. Yes your high impact low charge fusion is capable of crossmapping someone. But should this matter? Hell no. Because at that range a Hand Cannon Pulse Rifle Scout Rifle and even Auto Rifle would be more reliable. Choose your engagement distances wisely. Thesan FR is neat and can kill far. Same with Darkblades Spite and the  impact crew. And they charge like a Hot Wheels car slogging through mud. Why would you risk killing at admittedly long engagement distances with a weapon that charges so slow you only get the chance to land one shot instead of using your primary?Granted fast charge rifles do struggle to kill somebody at some of the more extreme distances that Thesan Foil Spite and others are capable of. But thats okay. Because what they can do is kill surprisingly far out of shotgun distance. Use a Pulse or Scout for the longer distances. Your Fusion Rifle only needs to fulfill its niche the ability to get constant one shot kills in the area outside shotgun range up to and including close Pulse Rifle range. And charging the fastest physically possible in that effective range is the only way to maximize your utility of this niche weapon.,CruciblePlaybook,cw7294o,1,t5_37lup

5522883,0,t3_3qqwfn,I respectfully disagree here in terms of KD not being important but I do agree with your commentary about becoming a better player.  I think KD is especially important in most game types because KD directly relates to winning the match Clash Trials Skirmish etc.I agree that sitting back and camping in a control game just to boost your KD from a . to a . is not helpful and that you should look at KD as a data point in conjunction with other data points for example with points per game but I would rather have a player with a . KD than a player under . because I know that on average they will win more v fights than not it might not be a perfect indicator but it is the best that we have.Additionally even for games where you need to control a certain point it is just as valuable to push up past the control point while killing enemies so that your team can capture the point behind you.  I think you are suggesting that KD should not be the sole focus which is definitely fair but KD is an important stat and one of the best indicators that we have in terms of measuring skill while admittedly not perfect.,CruciblePlaybook,cwhlj94,3,t5_37lup

It really was a struggle and after  games like someone commented is where things got really hairy. TTK dropped and our group focused mostly on the raid and getting to an appropriate Light Level. We havent done as much PvP as we used to aside from Iron Banner. We realized that was the problem forced more communication and eventually made it to the Lighthouse.

5565585,0,t3_3rcxdo,tbh right now the PDX suros pulse rifle is king for v engagements. However due to being tough to obtain Hawksaw is a VERY close nd. Even the vendor version tears through players. Guns like Bad Juju SoM Red Death etc are all great for multiple targets who may not all be focused on you. They can kill fast with little need for perfect aim and dont really punish body shots. However due to varying armor builds  perfect  headshots wont always mean a kill requiring  bursts to both the head and body which is pretty slow. Hawksaw however is a consistent  burst with headshots and  for body shots even allowing the user to miss a bullet. With Hawksaws higher Fire rate  bursts of hawksaw is faster than  bursts of the Red Death Archtetype. Hawksaw gt Bad Juju in my experience just because the recoil I find is nicer. And the PDX which is even better than the hawksaw. I will however use bad juju in s just because I am more likely to have multiple enemies lined up.,CruciblePlaybook,cwmymex,1,t5_37lup

5587923,0,t1_cwpkgep,The problem with Destiny matchmaking is that is rarely puts you in a game with two equally skilled teams. And now because of the lobby switching if youre someone like me youre put on a competent team and dominate then youre put on three teams with people who just got the game and level s and whatnot. Add that in with the blatant imbalance of things like the Sunbreaker and  Yard Stare and its just a losing battle. If my team doesnt know simple things like not to try to fight three people at once to clear heavy before whipping out your ultra cool rocket launcher and trying to pop it with no other teammates at that or even when something is blatantly not working Im tired of getting put on teams full of snipers who want to camp our spawn and then get ran over by people flanking grenades etc. special then its almost impossible to win especially when the other team has two or three sunbreakers and even id I have one he thinks its smart to hold on to his super just until the game is about to end.I actually miss the old meta now...at least the Trinity Hawkmoon TLW and Thorn compensated for how bad some players are. I used to think Destiny matchmaking was pretty cool...I could be paired up or paired down and learn to get better by seeing how better players play and I thought it made sense that there was no matchmaking because of it you dont want the good players only playing the good players. But with TTK theres almost little to no reason to play outside of a fireteam if you want to win...defeating that entire idea. Lol. I honestly thought how bad the Crucible is becoming at least for those of us who dont mind going in with a team of randoms was a ploy to get more people to buy Black Ops .,CruciblePlaybook,cwpqfjf,3,t5_37lup

You didnt have a line of communication with him so you cant rely on randoms to know how to help you.  Overthrowing that grenade really hurt you Stating the obvious I know. You did a really good job of escaping the pinch but you had a couple of options by using your super you would have tethered the  enemies at the top of the stairs who were already weak or you could have used your super on the guy at the sniper perch. Either would have been fine.  good grenade usage here.   This one is tough you were trying to anticipate an enemies movements but it ended up being a wasted super. The better solution was to swing around the left through the rubble so that you could get eyes on your target.  your smoke grenade would probably have finished one of those guys off.I bet your afk lost the game...

5596548,0,t1_cwqr39n,I definitely agree about the overall utility of the weapon. Unflinching heals and rapid reload are all fantastic. Unfortunately if you dont get the double tap your TTK shoots up to nearly a second.Since the Red Death crits for  without Aggressive Ballistics itll deal  damage on six crits anyways killing many players. Lets take a hypothetical player Timmy somewhere between the two of us who can pull off the six crit combo  of the time. This means that Aggressive Ballistics will help Timmy get a two burst kill .  X where X is the percentage of players with  or more health. Unfortunately I have no idea what X is but we can take a look at some values and speculate. Lets consider X at   and X  . only  of players are running enough armor to hit  hit points. In this case Aggressive helps Timmy get a kill . of the time.X  . half the players are running  hit points or more. Aggressive helps Timmy get a kill . of the time.X  . most of the players are running  hit points. Aggressive helps Timmy get a kill . of the time.Considering the penalties to range and AA how high do you think X has to be for Aggressive to be beneficial to Timmy?

5654593,0,t3_3skdwa,some people really really like bad Juju others just think its a little better than average.  I find bad Juju better at range than many of my Hawksaw and Suros PDX builds.  For fast moving targets at a distance I find the Bad Juju much better.  It deals more body damage which you are bound to hit with running and fleeing targets.  I think the Hawksaw is taking the cake on one on one engagements within its range because of making the opponent flinch sooner than you can with slower pulse rifles.  Consecutive head shots make the flinch worse and worse for the opponent.  fast fire rate helps that.  Im not pro pvp expert but that is the main reason I main a Suros PDX with full auto and small bore over my Bad Juju on most maps.  What further pushes the decision is that I can use an exotic shotty or keep the Truth equipped so I dont get caught with my pants down changing weapons during heavy round.    ,CruciblePlaybook,cwy0a2u,2,t5_37lup

Also use the current meta guns. Finding that perfect balance between reacting and being the aggressor is a big part too.

5770973,0,t3_3u6yph,on sky shock specifically as well as other huge maps like first light and bastion its crucial that your own sniper have a very high range stat. post. sniper damage and accuracy now begin to fall off pathetically early. this will be addressed with the December patch but for now you will probably struggle to snipe at long distances on combined arms type maps without a correspondingly high range stat. in my experience even with a  or  full bar there is a noticeable accuracy drop. worse the falloff means that the shots that do land wont necessarily kill even if they crit. again this will change soon but its still pretty stupid when you consider that scouts will often deal full damage from equally far away. also highly important your chosen scope which many people dont bother to switch depending on the situation. lowzoom scopes like shortgaze and ambush are popular for a reason they allow you to see more of your surroundings as well as stay unscoped for longer which means theyre the best choice for the majority of maps. but you should also recognize when its beneficial to switch to a higher zoom. theyre most useful on large maps or when the majority of your opponents are sitting back and sniping themselves not so much if theyre pushing forward and quickscoping aggressively. put simply zooming in more will make it easier to hit headshots because your opponents heads will be bigger. generally speaking at medium range a sniper with tacsys will have an edge over one with shortgaze. you just dont want to get too close because the added magnification will be disorienting in comparison. both of the above strategies assume that youd be sniping yourself. and id probably say that overall the best counter to a sniper is a better sniper. but if you dont snipe you have a few options. most importantly avoid long lines of sight. this is where prior sniping experience comes in handy once you know the best spots you can know to avoid them. likewise keep your eyes peeled for potential flanking routes especially buildings and tunnels. if you can close the gap without leaving cover you can often catch a sniper unaware or at least in a compromising position. lastly certain weapons can cause trouble for snipers specifically ones that inflict a lot of stagger. i havent found a concrete answer re the effectiveness of high caliber rounds. but some swear by it. pulse rifles in general are good at flinching snipers out of headshots but especially the fastestfiring archetype which includes grasp of malok and praedyths timepiece.,CruciblePlaybook,cxcfy11,1,t5_37lup

5842802,0,t3_3v9bth,Honestly its all about how your brain works and how you feel during traversal in Destiny. Ive changed from Default to Jumper and then did some manual remapping on Jumper with a Scuf as well as the built in Playstation Custom Button Assignments. Since the game came out Ive changed controls probably  times. Ill share my layout not as a suggestion but just for inspiration. Do what feels good even if its unorthodox.Playing on a Scuf PS with electromagnetic remapping on the paddles.L  Aim Down SightsR  ShootL  JumpR  Crouch did this for shadestep and slide turning  L  SuperR  MeleeTriangle  Weapon Swap Square  ReloadCircle  GrenadeX  SprintLeft Paddle  Square for reloads and specifically to revive and shoot at the same time. Super clutch in TrialsRight Paddle  Triangle for running and weapon swapping during traversalReasons for these controlsWhen I sprint all I do is tilt the left stick forward and press X once. This initiates sprint and I dont have to keep clicking the left stick for those awful sprint delays. After that I can do almost everything except throw my grenade without taking my hands off the right stick. Shadestepping with R and being able to use the right stick during the motion is ridiculous and effective. You can literally curve around walls and into cover.So after all the pain Ive put my brain through in retraining it to play this game. Personally this layout is what I have landed on. The Xbox Elite makes me jealous because it takes all this to the next level.  Good luck in finding your ideal layout. Have fun with it.,CruciblePlaybook,cxlindm,2,t5_37lup

5843899,0,t3_3v7agv,You seem like a nice guy and although you got the whole average completely wrong I think you see your mistake now.   Anyway in terms of your question I suggest you look at this guide which mtashed made some time agoWe all have short or long periods of playing badly. Theres a difference between plateauing and slipping. The former is due to the fact that the easy wins in term of your progression is over. Given your current level which is somewhat similar to mine I can tell from personal experience that improving becomes fore of a struggle. The second has to do with you maybe playing in the wrong way e.g. playing  hours without aim instead of playing  hour concentrated focusing on drag scoping or whatever. Crucible Radio has a great podcast with sport psychiatrist Steve on the topic of training. If you find yourself consistently making wrong mistakes and getting salty then maybe take a week of Destiny  it helps for me to get some perspective.

You need to Really start getting aggressive I rarely saw you seeking out an opponent you would wait in a little area for a blip on the radar than take out your sniper.  You wouldnt shoot first either there was at least  gun fights where you were really slow to shoot or maybe second guessed yourself.  Rumble is all about spawns and being aggressive.  You need to get into a power position get a kill look away and know he will spawn in that location or another guy on your kill feed.  Most of those guys did not have great gun skill if you had gotten the first shot off on  fights youd have easily won.  TLW practice starting and ending the engagements.  Be first to fire if not you need to run get HP back and reengage but on your terms dont let them corner you and than hard scope a good player will jump over your reticle and kill you every time.

5912590,0,t1_cxumtlv,Its difficult to see the logic because there wasnt any logic that went into those changes. Making fast firing fusions charge faster for less damage? Stupid. Nerfing high impact pulses that NO ONE except me uses? Stupid. I dont know what computer algorithms Bungie uses to actually see how they go about nerfs but they should have unplugged the computer and plugged it back in. Maybe their computers are as finicky as their patch notes team. But one thing is certain theres no way a team of actual people at Bungie who are actually good at their own game play it and really discover what needs to be nerfed and by how much. Theres just no possible way an intelligent human being could think hmmmmm. No one uses high impact pulses. Theyre not really affecting the current meta in any meaningful way. Oh! I know! FIFTEEN PERCENT DAMAGE NERF! Its just such a shame they can be so daft. They did some great things with this patch. Fixing titans giving hand cannons back some much needed accuracy y versions of some old favorite exotics. Those are some fantastic changes. But heres to hoping that one day Bungie will be smart enough to make a patch that does everything right. Im not saying everything needs to be OP. IMO a perfect weapons sandbox would bePulses Put pulses back where they were with . Adjust damage falloff to be more drasticHand Cannons Revert hand cannons to their pre . state Simply add extreme damage falloff from closemid range and outScout Rifles Do nothing. Theyre fine. Other weapon types are the problem.Auto Rifles Slightly higher base damage increase. Stability falloff all other factors are great. If anything decrease hip fire accuracy to compensate for bullet hose archetypes ability to hip fire melt with their new damage numbers.Fusion Rifles Completely undo the pointless changes to high charge rate fusions.  Im not sure on this but possibly add more aim assist to compensate for phantom projectiles not landing due to the ever present lag on Destiny.Shotguns Shotguns feel good right now.

5914756,0,t1_cxusw7w,maybe the problem is trying to force yourself to find a reason behind it  when there is none.  There is simply no logic whatsoever that a . buff to the lowest impact archetype is going to change anything  might as well report as no change at all.  Its really simple.. they fucked up  they dont have enough resources to fix to what was the intended values  which was what was announced more than a week ago. So the updated numbers they put up there reflects what happened instead of what is intended  and were left to deal with it.   Something went wrong  there were bugs  and fixing and changing the values means hey have to go over every change they made  and introducing a fix could mean tons of new problems. So instead of going over and admitting something horribly went wrong with limited people  limited resources  limited time  so instead they just left it where it is and pretended that these changes were intended and what was planned all along  that the error was in the notes and not what was applied.  Shame....  Its clear Weisnewski holds no passion for this game but the community doesnt deserve his bullshit.

5929275,0,t1_cxwus8i,I agree but with players having to shoot more bodyshots to kill then they are going to have less ammo with their sniper. The  headshot rate in trials shows that players seem to miss the head a lot. That  also doesnt take into account how much players just simply miss the target all together.I wouldnt mind more changes to the way special ammo changes but I think Bungie has made it clear that they want your primaryspecial choices to be used to compliment each other and I think with more special ammo changes this is going to lead to a lot of weapon switching done midgame. For example if I start the game with TLWsniper and run out of sniper ammo I will usually switch to a longer range primary until I have more sniper ammo. ,CruciblePlaybook,cxwuxta,1,t5_37lup

5995572,0,t1_cy59mwl,Oh good god... sorry Ill use fewer syllables for you so its easy for you to understand.I played ON the patch. Only the Hawksaw variety pulse rifle was any good. Nirwens and Red Death took too much of a drop. The messenger sucked. My friend couldnt play with his Grasp of Malok. An entire balanced group of weapons just FUCKED for some imaginary sense of balance.And yeah I havent played since... but I have read the board. And what I gather HCs arent much better but TLW is great. Scouts havent gotten much better but MIDA is year  something they could have done without adjustments to Pulse Rifles and things would have been great. ARs still blow.But because some dbag named uphamg has the same KD I guess I should believe him over well literally everyone else.Im not saying the game isnt fun anymore. Weapon balance was never what made this game fun it was the mobility the class distinctions the speed and the verticality. It is the most fun PvP game Ive ever played. And I just wont play it anymore because the team that balances the PvP is just so god damn inept. Its frustrating. We had an entire completely balanced Pulse Rifle class. The only time in this games history where every single archetype of pulse rifle was usable. Nothing felt overpowered a Nerwins could beat a Hawksaw which could beat a Messanger which could beat a Grasp all dependent on situation and comfort.Gone. Because the developers cant change things without tearing down the previous set.Whats shocking is that you are OK with it. So many good players have gone on to admittedly lesser games Gabe Logain Pwodigy because the devs dont mess with weapon balance and dont make things WORSE under the guise of making things better.

There may be some weapons that certain players tend to go to after using horrible weapons.For example say a lot of players really love fusion rifles and typically use terrible ones then they eventually get Plan C and their KD goes up.  That doesnt mean Plan C is a particularly powerful weapon it means its a particularly solid fusion.

6048632,0,t3_3yd7cu,I have mixed feelings about Fusion Grenades and the like. On one hand getting one shotted by a grenade sucks specially when you know your grenades dont do that. On the other hand to make that grenade stick you usually have to put yourself in situations where most of the time the best you can hope to do is trade. Also their use is fairly limited. Its hard to finish someone off with a Fusion Grenade or to hit someone around a corner. Maybe you can bounce them? But thats not going to happen often.What Im trying to say is without some magnetism they would be useless even in PVE. In the time it would take you to stop look and aim youll die twice.,CruciblePlaybook,cychagi,1,t5_37lup

6052915,0,t1_cyd0hx1,For best performance I would recommend staying under  and using a gaming monitor instead of a TV.  That said you can negate the disadvantages of a larger TV by sitting further back from it.  I noticed that you changed your sensitivity at the start of the game.  Once you find what works for you try to stick with it.  It can be tempting to change it up when you perform poorly but thats a fallacy and it will only throw your aim off.  Better to get used to a sensitivity and stick with it.  Also use axion bolts they are easily the best voidwalker grenade.  Vortex grenades are some of the worst grenades in the game.  When you grabbed heavy at  you ran straight at the enemy.  There are a few key strategies to using heavy effectively  The most important thing to remember especially when using a machine gun is to play defensively.  Remember that its a lot easier to lose heavy than it is to keep it.   Stay on the perimeter of the map and watch your radar to make sure you are keeping the enemies in front of you.   Try to engage one at a time and never engage while weak.   Retreat to reload.   Stay near your teammates.   Its good practice to wait a minute after heavy drops before doing anything  all the rockets will usually fly right away.  You had some nice snipes overall I think you just need more practice and youll be putting up big numbers in no time.  ,CruciblePlaybook,cyd1dc4,6,t5_37lup

Its not solely to prove of its existence its also to measure how strict it is at different levels of play . KD . KD . KD.Also from what I understand SBMM has been around on PC for years before console games started using it. Even if Bungie developed it developing a flawed system of matchmaking is nothing to reward them for. Treyarch does it Xs better with lobby balancing connect based on connection players skill levels will be random then balance the room so the teams are close to even.I didnt know Destiny Tracker kept track of KD during games played.

6121674,0,t3_3ze96o,when running as a  man im usually the playmaker for my clan and my advice would be the followingfirst off  of the players NEED to be running to B at the start of the game grenades need to be used and it must be captured this is THE most important thing get the advantage early and make the other team have to make a move and pick them off as they do so...Super use  this needs to be coordinated roaming supers need to be used to push aggressively or defend aggressively be this for a capture point or for a heavy any available teammates should be collecting the orbs and chaining supers... the people with instant supers such as voidwalker and strikers should be using their supers to shut down the opposing roaming supers andor clearing plates that are being captured again orb collection and communcation of where they are and if it is safe to move in is important.Heavy you need to plan when these are coming use supers to secure and ensure the other team get nothing even if this means suicide for one person then punish the other team.This is perhaps the most important point DO NOT push too far leave the other team with one capture point and you know where they will spawn pin them in the spawn and push the lead further and further but try not to flip the spawns if this happens then decide which end you want communicate and regain the pin of the other team.its going to take practice and time to get these things down and you wont win every single match but weve had a good time in IB this time round with a pretty average PVP squad and its been fun we have been at  win ratio at a guess and some good team chemistry building.I hope it helps!,CruciblePlaybook,cylgyeu,2,t5_37lup

The most important feedback I would have its the fact that the guide dont have a clear difference between PVE and PVP oriented perks. if focused on PVP roll then i would made it clear in the document and in the post especially on the DTG sub here we dont expect much PVE talk D   A good example could be the cocytus as the need will drastically different and e perks that could god roll for PVE firefly will not be for PVP.

Weve all seen those games where an entire team goes positive and the entire other team goes negative.  This is more a snowball effect from some early bad plays.  Regardless there isnt a lot to do about it.  I had a control game where it was pretty clear early on that we werent going to win and I decided I wasnt going to push Bravo when it wasnt going to happen.    Im the guy on the losing team with the positive KD.  We were pretty much stuck in our spawn on Pantheon and I kept hearing enemy supers going off.  So many golden guns.  I would run and hide and try to get kills where I could and not die.

6236237,0,t1_cyy8sgg,In my opinion youre both correct. Rerolling isnt what led to the meta being stagnant but I think in some capacity it contributed. Poor perk and weapon balancing was the issue at the heart of the stagnant meta. However as I understand it when Bungie attempted to resolve that when rerolling was still available people used rerolling as a method of underminingworking around Bungies balance changes. So while rerolling wasnt driving stagnancy it ended up contributing to it over time. edited for typo,CruciblePlaybook,cyyhqmg,3,t5_37lup

And secondly rerolling isnt at fault when people were using the same perks. The perk pool was. Only one or two perks for a given nod was interesting back in Y.

6245123,0,t3_413qmy,For all the folks asking about NetdumaIve been using one for a couple weeks.  It decreases the number of games you will have laggers in.  It most certainly does NOT and no router could completely eliminate laggy opponents.  Mostly this is because of how Destiny does matchmaking.  Also you could get players right next to you geographically that just have shitty internet are using bittorrent while they play or are actually lag switching.  Nothing Netduma can do about that.Netduma will simply prevent people outside the georange you set from connecting to your game most of the time.  However it only performs this check on the fireteam leader when fireteams join your game.  This is due to how Destiny matchmaking works and theres nothing Netduma can do to fix it.   So if the opponent fireteam leader is in your georange and the other  guys on his fireteam are in Timbuktu guess what?  Youre gonna have a lot of laggy opponents.There also seems to be some sort of proxy connection that Destiny will route players through when Netduma blocks them initially.  I get occasional connections from the UK that are super laggy and Netduma wont allow me to block them.  When I talked to Netduma support they told me that was a Destiny dedicated server lol and that it couldnt be blocked.  They said Destiny uses it to route players traffic to my game when they cant connect to me directly.  Sounds fishy but I dont have evidence to argue with them.   Doesnt happen often enough to be a huge concern.I am still happy with the purchase and it has measurably improved the quality of games I get in Crucible.  But it is not the holy grail of fixing lag and matchmaking that some seem to think it might be  that will have to come from Bungie.,CruciblePlaybook,cyzi3to,1,t5_37lup

Up to about ish meters itll be a fair fight between me with DoP and a MIDA not doing those things. Do those things and Ill run for cover like you win I give up.TLW but honestly you gotta be close for TLW to beat my DoP. Like almost shotgunclose.Snipers I mean.. Dont let me flinch you too much first. Sometimes I get  bullets in a sniper before the flinch actually registers for them due to latency and it looks like BS on my screen but the lesson is that a calm confident sniper can beat DoP at virtually any range.Shotguns.. Kinda. If Im aware that a shotgunner is near me its actually easier than you think for me to walk back and hipfire till they fall so.. I dont really recommend using a shotgun to counter DoP unless you happen to notice the DoP user isnt too keen with these antirush tactics.Grenades if you get a nade on me you can follow up with the Khvostov and still win. Assuming you can out run me. If you go for this tactic consider opting for high agility.Thorn but if I know Im going against a Thorn user Ill spec for max armor Striker main here and Ill be able to tank  body shots its kinda funny. I have nothing else to add about Thorn. I prefer Trials over scrims anyways.Last bit of weapon advice if you have a DoP with CB practice with it your self. This gun wrecks at a greater range than people ever expect especially if you use smallbore and the rifle scope.Last bit of general advice the best counter to going against any player with a better primary game than you is to out think them with your positioning on the map and choice of gear. Using cover better using your subclass and exotic armor abilities better using your teammates better and using your special weapons better are really the only options for beating a player whos been beating you.,CruciblePlaybook,cz0khi7,2,t5_37lup

6268443,0,t1_cz1j21h,The middle perk will depend on how you use the weapon. But keep in mind accuracy is partially tied to range. The more range you have on a hand cannon the tighter the cone of projectile probability would be. And with the purely vertical recoil its pretty easy to do follow up shots at near max RoF with just a tiny bit of recoil compensation even if you have a really low stability stat. You can probably guess where my bias lies from my post range range range!! But depending on how rapidly you fire you might still benefit from higher stability. But since range also inherently gives hand cannons more accuracy its the most important thing to me. It helps make hand cannons be as consistent as possible. except TLW which is completely ass backwards compared to what i just said.,CruciblePlaybook,cz25hju,1,t5_37lup

Of course you have less passion for the game than you did  months ago thats when a HUGE content drop happened and there hasnt been any content since. Think of it this way are you as excited now as you were on Christmas day getting the best present you got? Of course not. But you bet your ass youre gonna be just as excited again when Christmas rolls around again in a year.Everyone on the internet has such bad long term memory. This lull happened last year between Dark Below and HoW and then again between HoW and TTK and people were saying the same thing. Destinys dead I dont have the same excitement I did when the game first came out Then TTK came out and hype went through the roof. Now were back to the lull again.Theres no peak for Destiny. It is and always will be a series of mountains. Hype will go up and down throughout the year.Basically what Im saying is your loss of passion is normal. Why would hype for a game stay as high as it is when a huge content drop happens months after that content has dropped? That makes no sense. Destinys not dead. Its not going anywhere. Your hype cant stay at  all the time otherwise it wouldnt be hype it would just be normal.

You want quickdraw and any accuracy  stability perks on it so you can quickly switch to it while spamming the trigger and getting a spasm of bodyshots to take down the incoming threat. Also good to momentarily switch when you are turning into tight corners  corridors. Pairs well with pulse scout rifles and NLB. ,CruciblePlaybook,cz66kzg,3,t5_37lup

6335617,0,t1_cz98sjp,Quick Draw does zero to counteract the readiness nerfs on shotguns. On top of that its even worse out of a Blink jump which is why so many ppl have dropped Blink for better control. Going the other way around back to primary is fine but to shotty it has zero effect. In fact if you put on something with singlepoint sling chaperone or something and use Quick Draw it actually appears to take LONGER than if you didnt have either perk active. Me thinks its bug. IMO.. just my own observation. Never seen anyone try some science on it.,CruciblePlaybook,cz9sg75,2,t5_37lup

6342668,0,t1_czafk2h,Hello! So I said I would create a timeline... so here it goes!Year  Some great moments some average. Its just my attempt at remembering the times my shots actually landed.Rumble  Cant complain. Decent game and my first time playing with NLB in quite some time.Rift  A few games later NLB is warming up and things are improving.ToO ? After a week or so of NLB as my primary decided to take it into ToO. Seems like hard work had paid off.Iron Banner  After not playing with my Longbow Synthesis with Snapshot I finally started getting into the groove of playing with a KYS.ToO Y Memento Highlights Its basically some cool snipes and a few bonus plays. Just continuing to show progress is all.Zone Control  Its always good to take a couple games and remind yourself as a sniper that your primary does in fact exist.ToO Game   Recent sniper control. Shows off some decent twitch snipes against some opponents attempting to hide their bodies while still sniping.ToO Game   Some good drag scopes good positioning and all around good plays.Now if you notice these arent the most amazing gameplays youve seen. I didnt go around and cherry pick the best games or the unbroken games or pick any of the games where we mercy ruled people that were just of a lower skill level. I chose these because they were decent gameplay and I wanted to show the OP and any other aspiring snipers that improvement does happen. You just have to stick with it.Side note Sniping is not the end all way to play Destiny. Its not a guaranteed win its not a  bulletproofperfectly viable strategy. Shotgunning is most certainly viable and youll see me pull one out from time to time. Im a big fan of sidearms and lately been having a blast with fusion rifles my Y Peruns Fire with Perfect Balance and hipfire as well as a Y Vortex with Hand Laid Stock and Hot Swap I believe. All the secondary weapons in this game take a different approach and a different type of skill.

6347215,0,t1_czb0zm8,The weapon model being behind cover is a problem with the game models themselves not the mechanics.  When you aim a weapon the barrel is generally in line with your jaw which last time I checked was part of the average persons head.  Even when youre blindly spraying a weapon it will still be in that general area for the simple reason of getting hit in the shoulder  times in a few seconds by an  lb rifle hurts less then having your wrists wrenched that many times by the same gun.  Even accounting for someone who is so stupidly manly they feel the need to rest their elbows on whatever it is theyre using as cover as opposed to just poking the barrel of the rifle out and not exposing anything north of their pussy ass jaw and preferably even less than that if it can be managed for fear of a mere couple dozen grams of lead youre still talking nipple height exposure as opposed to head height.Is it unfair is the next question and if you couldnt guess Im firmly on the side of no.  If you let your enemy set himself up in an advantageous position and then try to fight him there yeah you deserve to lose that fight. Its no different than trying to fight a titan inside his bubble.  He controls that area now or in the case of the sniper hiding behind cover at least the  degree angle he has cover from. If you keep running out there to challenge you dont get to complain about it being broken much like if you keep on running around the same corner with the exact same shotgunner hiding behind it and keep dying to them you really cant whine about corners being a broken mechanic.Are there games that people have found spots that provide cover and line of sight on all approaches such that the first person there wont die unless they run out of ammo? Probably but thats a failure of map design not the basic mechanic and I truthfully cant think of any in Destinys pvp maps.TLDR  The basic mechanic is accurate its video game models that hold their guns too low andor heads too high while ADS.,CruciblePlaybook,czb3w0i,2,t5_37lup

6504027,0,t3_44o056,Ive played with both in various shooters though not Destiny. I know theres a lot of back and forth on here and I understand that mouse users will struggle with certain aspects of Destiny gameplay specifically around need to hold the thumbstick down to manage high recoil weapons or sustained recoil weapons. Thing is thats in other games too. And while thumbsticks might be better at controlling recoil it is and always will be easier to click on your opponents head with a mouse than to find it with the center of your screen using two joysticks. I havent seen any argument against that which basically proves to me that it is not a balanced input. Do I care very much as regards casual play? No. But would I care if Destiny PVP were truly competitive and I were participating in it for that purpose? Yes.Anecdata I played a ton of Halo in college. Dating myself a bit I know. I was okay not outstanding. Could snipe with some success given a good position and an opponent who stopped moving for a second or two. Went home over the summer and played on a PC at a video game cafe  unfamiliar mouse smaller screen. Prior PC shooter experience was mostly a bunch of Counterstrike which I was middling at. Suddenly I could jump and land headshots midair with my sniper rifle in Halo. Went back to school the next fall  I could not jump and land headshots midair with my sniper rifle on the xbox. Conclusion The input was the difference.EDIT Yes you could also conclude I was just MUCH better with mouse and keyboard than with a controller. I was. Because they are easier to use and better.,CruciblePlaybook,czs2d42,2,t5_37lup

6506616,0,t1_czs9szg,Just wanted to say I enjoy your streams. While Im unsure if KBM gives a huge advantage in aiming with the way Destiny works as I havnt tried it anecdotal evidence suggests it wouldnt exactly control like CS or TF or we I want to commend you on your shadestep skills. I think the angles you manage are actually much harder using WASD than a traditional movement stick. Also wanted to say that the last bulletpoint here is the key point. It sounds like you wouldnt be salty if tournament directors decided to ban KBM. As long as this holds true I dont see much point to complain afterall its just a game until money is on the line and at that point it is up to the tournament director. If they allow it great. If they dont than it seems like you would understand why. ,CruciblePlaybook,czsc08z,2,t5_37lup

6590552,0,t3_45xfhc,Welcome to the club!  Trials is the most fun Ive had in PvP in probably any game Ive played.  The way it is now you will get decent loot just by playing so its worth your time even if you have a rough time early on.  It will take some time to get the hang of it. And what I mean by that is positioning staying with your team reviving and knowing how to manage the other teams orb when they are down.  There are a ton of good tips on here TrueVanguard has a video series on youtube that is where I would start and also watching people on twitch will help.  Ive found that finding people with less viewers tends to be more helpful.  RealKraftyy for instance has a ton of viewers and is an amazing player but he is too good and I learn more from people closer to my skill level.  It would be like watching vids on how to get better at basketball and watching MJ dunk from the free throw line.  You will say holy shit that was amazing but odds are you wont be dunking from the free throw line and it would be more beneficial watching a vid on a proper follow through when shooting.  You will also need to find a couple people to play with.  I personally use DestinyTeamFinder and Ive met a lot of great people there that I still play trials with on a weekly basis.  There will be a lot of people in the chat looking for a group just for trials bounties which means they arent looking to go flawless they just want to play to complete the weekly trials bounties and this may be a good place to get your feet wet and farm passage coins for later on. ,CruciblePlaybook,d010mdp,3,t5_37lup

Last Resort is a situational perk but given that its particular situation is not exactly uncommon in v Crucible play I feel like you can get good work out of it.  Its on the Adept Trials weapons for a reason...Im not sure Persistence will be all that useful on this one mainly because I dont know how many continuous rounds fired it takes for it to proc.  On a gun like Doctrine of Passing its kind of a nonfactor because the magazine is a generous  roundsyou can afford to give up the shots.  On a  round magazine you have much less wiggle rooom.  Rifled Barrel is the next best thing to have available after a stability perk.     All in allRoll  is going to give you a middle of the road PVP AR.  If youre fine with that go ahead.

6684617,0,t3_474ezy,Aside from practicing gun skill and finding your goto load out decision making plays the biggest role in how good you are. Ive started to notice when opposing players make bad decisions and my team even takes the opportunity to talk over what they did and why it was wrong. It helps us not make the same mistakes. Here are some general things weve noticed A player separates from his teammates and gets into no mans land and we easily pick him.  I cant stress enough how many times I see struggling players make this mistake. My team aggressively looks for enemies by themselves. If one of us sees one guy alone or recognizes that we are in a v we call it out and immediately put numbers on the guy. It almost always gives us a free kill. If you separate from your teammates you need to let them know. Also if you see a teammate who is deep in the enemy spawn alone let him know immediately. Bad positioning and bad communication are a huge KD killer. If you or your teammate goes down quickly in a bad spot it effects everyone else stats.  A player peeks twice or reengages when he is already weak. I see this a lot. If you dont get the first snipe or get bodied or significantly damaged you need to dip out and find a different angle once you are healed. Communicate to your teammates that you need help. This will save you a lot of unnecessary deaths. Dying less is the first step to getting better. A player has the wrong weapon out during an engagement or doesnt utilize the proper range scenario with a certain weapon. I see this a ton. Why would you have your shotgun out when we are at a primary distance? And why try to warrior me from  feet away? Why try to challenge at a longer range with a Last Word or Doctrine when I have a PDX with a great range perk? Its a free kill for me. Know your weapon well and have the proper weapon equipped when entering a gun fight. A player gets a kill on me or my teammate and doesnt properly zone the orb or pushes a bit late and runs into a freshly over shielded group of us. This happens so much. If you or your teammate pull a kill communicate and immediately zone that orb if possible. If you cant zone it easily as a team at least communicate where the orb is and how your team needs to work on zoning it. Re establish your team in accordance to where your kills are and take the fight from there. My team is able to turn fights around a ton by getting a quick Rez off and downing a player by himself.

You referenced the skilled portion of the sweaty community so its really hard to figure out who exactly youre talking about.  You also keep referencing theytheir like youre talking about a specific group in general that people are supposed to understand exactly who  youre talking about.  Especially when you say things like gt There isnt really a ton of consideration about running weapons other than their meta because its a small community and so there are fewer people running weird stuff to try and beat their meta instead of matching it. When people do find stuff they tend to ban it because its usually not focused around directly gunning a target down.It reads like youre talking about a specific group of people that have the same hivemindgroupthink and the overall tone is disparagingcritical.  Not to mention the actual content isnt factual either since there has been consideration about running other weapons and they arent banning stuff that is found.  The rules really havent changed much if at all.  Plus all these bans that CPB posters keep recommending have already been experimented with.   gt The sweaty community inasmuch as it exists isnt just the few trendsetters at the top.

6721587,0,t3_47p3cq,What is needed for it to be competitive is a damage buff when the first curse perk procs. If it boosted the damage just enough that it could consistently two shot it would be competitive. Probably a little too competitive to be promptly nerfed back to its current lackluster state. My problem is that that extra impact tier has little to no benefit with the lessened rate of fire. All hand cannons can kill with three bullets. The first curse is not an exception but every shot now has more importance because of its slower rate of fire. This makes the gun unforgiving and unrewarding to a skilled hand because it doesnt matter you would be better off using any other hand cannon because they are more forgiving.The range is nice though. Thats about its only advantage.,CruciblePlaybook,d0ekj7v,5,t5_37lup

Its more difficult to apply this in game as you cant blur your reticle and focus on your target but thats the way were taught. Its better to focus on where you want to hit the target and use your blurry or peripherals to line up the reticule. Usually when I snap in in the game. I look for the head. I hardly even notice the reticule until I need to line it up. But hey Im probably average.

6784141,0,t1_d0kz1xm,The stability is slightly higher than the hung jury at base. Extended mag brings it up to  rounds. So its got slightly more stability and three less rounds than the hung jury. So its preference really what do you prefer more shots in the mag and get rewarded for critical hits with more ammo or more survivability with life support. Today life support pricked on one of golgoroths poison balls and helped keep me alive during challenge mode. Here is mine in comparison to the hung jury I also dont personally use hung jury with HLS I think that the stability is excellent as it is and I have never had an issue with it but I always preferred field scout on my vision of confluence and fang of ir yur as well so I am very used to some recoil on that archatype of weapon. I also felt that triple tap synergies better with a larger mag. The added aim assist is incredibly noticeable. The scopes do stick to enemies much more than the hung jury and its probably going to take me a while to get used to it. Dont get me wrong the hung jury is still an INCREDIBLE weapon that rewards you with a lot of ammo with the combination of extended mag and triple tap. I just personally feel that the increased survivability provided by life support is a nice little crutc for me to lean on every now and then. ,CruciblePlaybook,d0l9obq,1,t5_37lup

Whats the endgame in that situation? Sweats and tournaments right? Or maybe respect from your friends?Both of those situations do not involve the use of heavy weapons. Sweats and tournys dont use heavy and your friends andor peers wont respect you when you win all your rumble games from using a heavy machine gun every game.So what I was trying to get at in my last crazily downvoted comment was that its a waste of your time to use heavy weapons because you could be using that time to work on your gunskill and positioning. When you use heavy you dont have to worry about any of that and everything you learned goes out the window.Ill leave with this analogy. Let say youre a mountain climber and theres an extremely hard climb that barely anyone can make. Theres also a secret elevator that only you know about that leads to the top of that mountain and the end of said hard climb. Since its a secret elevator you can make it to the top of the climb and claim that you made the climb and everyone will believe you.

7056661,0,t1_d1f3flj,Something that you disagree with  logical fallacy.If youre playing on a map that is larger than a single room then of course you will need map awareness and communication. You will always need reaction times in any situation specifically if youre aimed down sights.I have spent many games in the playlist and all that I have found is that going into a straight up gunfight is always a bad idea. You will be more successful and do much better if you play to the gametype which means essentially trying to find people before they find you. If you are in a gunfight you are distracted damaged and unable to know if an enemy is approaching you or not with how maps in Destiny are designed to where every single area of the map has  or more entrances sometimes up to . Thats not to mention abundant pieces of cover and things like portals on a couple of maps.Having constant notifications removes certain aspects... maybe. But at the same time it introduces new aspects such as mind games with the radar making things like invis meaningful etc.By your argument I guess grenades are a crutch because they negate cover use. Longrange guns are a crutch because they negate gap closing. And so on and so forth.The thing is that long range guns and grenades do require their own skillset grenades need good prediction of movement timing and precision while long range guns need a great deal of accuracy. You see my point.Inferno is cool. I dont hate it and I would love if it were made into a permanent playlist for those who enjoy it. Sometimes I like to hop into it myself.However it is not objectively better and shouldnt be shoved down everybodys throat in modes like Trials for example. Having it as an option is one thing but forcing it upon everyone is something else.,CruciblePlaybook,d1g8co7,1,t5_37lup

7109692,0,t1_d1m6ycn,I agree they shouldve kept it to purely cosmetic items but Im not really worried about god roll armor.  Ive never really thought Ive lost a gunfight due to god roll anything.  I find the meta player skill and just the randomness of the engagement play a far bigger skill. The only guns I can think of that were exceptions were ones behind in game walls Felwinters with max range the spear that could one shot to the body and the doctrine somewhat. But all those guns now either got nerfed or have easily attainable rough equivalents.  Theyre good guns but rarely the reason I loose a firefight. I suppose the rep boost could be troubling but thats largely dependent on the drop rates and price. You have to get a boost to roll on the package then use the boost during play to level up faster then hope a weapon drops you like and also hope it rolls with what you want. Im dubious of how feasible itll be too burgh money in search of a weapon that will probably give a player a minimal advantage if that. Itll depend on the specifics of course but as long as its not easily exploitable I think most folks will just pick one up here and there. The slippery slope idea is kind of misnomer. Slippery slope is actually a logical fallacy that one thing inevitably leads to another. I hear that thats the case in COD but Im inclined to think it wont be in destiny. I think Bungie knows buying op guns would cause an exodus. But itll really come down to specifics. Is it exploitable or will it cost hundreds of dollars and RNGesus to obtain a minimal advantage? I encourage someone to go all in with their wallet in the name of science and post their results. At least then outrage would be rooted in facts.

And I didnt say anything about Elo.  Diamond Elo doesnt mean anything.  Theres people in Diamond with  win rates and theres people in Diamond with  win ratestheres a reason I pointed out win rates. Plus Elo is being reset so no one is going to have Diamond Elo until they start playing ToO again.  gt All im looking to accomplish is to get up to say  or so.Right thats not working so far.  That generally doesnt work for the significant majority of LFG.

7265280,0,t3_4eurin,gt The focus fire Suros regime would be back to prominence.No. Its not that great. It is probably a s weapon given that it has a little bit of a sweet spot between Mida and Hawksaw range where it is incredibly stable but in s it simply does not cut it. It fires too slow the TTK is just too high if you dont hit all head shots and that range you need to compete in is too easily broken unless people are kind of forced into a box like most control or clash games.Now there is a fan fire method that might make the gun a bit better because it speeds up fire rate but keeping people in its optimal range is just too tough. It is not back to prominence. gt Thorn would be dead and hawkmoon would be the go to exotic hand cannon. Hawkmoon will be the go to exotic hand cannon because it is a y... but I tried both and Thorn is still king. Sure Hawkmoon has the potential for a shot kill and that is HUGE I think a few great players will main it but the point of Hand Cannons is the ability to duck in and out of cover while shooting and Thorns head body versatility really makes it still great. Bungie needed to nerf its handling and stability while keeping its ability to three body shot like in . but they just lowered the damage and honestly it isnt that much of a problem to get one head shot out of three. The thing is really good it will still be the most used weapon in sweats.gt fusion rifles may finally get their day in the sunThey are definitely better and now will be a staple of people who WANT to use fusion rifles. But shotguns and snipers are still inherently better. Fusion Rifles just fight on a range where you can use a primary they are hard to balance. gt Dregs promise would be near broken and very hard to get to drop. A great weapon but again on par with fusion rifles and not as good as a shotgun or sniper. The tracking is great but it still takes quite a bit of bursts to kill someone which is enough time for a shotgun or TLW to trade... and you cant use verticality like you can with a shotgun to get in range. This will not be competitive at all.So imo you are .GG ,CruciblePlaybook,d240esn,1,t5_37lup

7272796,0,t3_4ewscb,Great work so far I really appreciate it! One thing that I dont see anyone talking about is the Hakke sniper scope ATA Scout.In the past people always complained that the circular reticle was too large for accurate sniping but now that the zoom has been increased from .x to .x Ive noticed that the reticle size tends to match the size of my targets head at medium range. Im pretty much in love with it now.There are two main drawbacks IMO.  If you get shot while ADS the flinch is a bit ridiculous and hard to get used to. When getting shot from the front your reticle not really the scope itself bounces downward whereas the classic snipers will bounce upward when flinched. Its weird but it can work in your favor if youre lined up for a headshot because it bounces downward for a body shot rather upward for a miss.  Its not great for long distance countersniping. Its actually fine at long distance especially if you use the tape trick to pinpoint the center of the reticle on the screen. But a kYS or LDR with shortgaze will feel more precise and allow for that perfectly timed shot right on the edge of their earlobe as they make a second peek down a sniper lane.On the plus side the Antimony and TamarD snipers handle like a dream with ATA scout especially with snapshot or quickdraw. And their high aim assist stats allow for breezy quickscopes. These snipers are really meant for a fast dynamic play style at medium range. Theyre not quite as strong for a passive hardscoping play style. Just got a TamarD with ATA Scout Take A Knee yay for sliding noscopes that Im not good enough to land! and Snapshot. Now that its a ressniper I may never go back to my kYS with Shortgaze Quickdraw Partial Refund and Outlaw. Im hooked.Sorry for the rant.TLDR The ATA Scout scope on Hakke snipers is really good if you like to play fast at closemedium range. IMO the ATA Scout actually benefitted the recent changes to lowzoom scopes. Hakke snipers can also ressnipe now. Go try it!,CruciblePlaybook,d24v9fj,2,t5_37lup

Maybe this is preference but lets say were messing around in skirmish or maybe even control.  Id rather have my lesser skill teammates getting a body shot or team shooting rather than having a shotgun.  Not that you have to play aggressive with shotgun only that they might not ever use their secondary since the goal for these guys trying to get better is to be more selective with their engagements and stay alive.But again this is my opinion on this.

7313627,0,t3_4fhfzh,Well i didnt read all the comments so if someone allready brought this up im sorry but the thing is with v that you should not snipe as much. Dont stay hardscoped for to long try to figure out where ppl are coming from and set up a snipe. Plan it in advance never stumble in to a sniper battle. If you look at the best players in scrims they use their primary alot. Sure trials and scrims is a big differense trials is much slower in that regard. So that allows for more sniping but if you play scrims and one on your team goes down expect to get rushed. When that happens you might have time to get one snipershot of before they are in your face so to get better at sniping dont just focus at sniping but when to use a sniper and when its time to use primary. And yea this one you heard before dont peak twice but if you go up against some really good players dont peak once. If they know where you are and nothing is destracting them dont stick your head out there. Catch them of guard use a granade or a primary. Dont stare yourself blind on just the sniper.,CruciblePlaybook,d29icvy,1,t5_37lup

7379521,0,t1_d2gzscr,Yeah I was one of those people who used to whine a lot about phantom bullets with the Water Star and while I feel like this happens once in a while it is usually due to me spamming the crap out of the Water Star and letting the recoil kick away from my target. When I slow down my shooting a bit the shots do connect. However like you said the Water Star will reward a more precise player compared to something like an Eyasluna or Uffern which are great options as well. ,CruciblePlaybook,d2h018a,1,t5_37lup

I dont think having an omnipresent reticle is a good idea for this game. I guess people were tired of getting headshotted from ten feet away but then again the majority of the player base just charge relentlessly and dont seem to change tactics use cover or learn from their mistakes. These are just my opinions and my observations. Im not sure why you needed to post your halo kds either. There isnt a minimum kd requirement for you to post your thoughts here. As long as they are well articulated and promote discussion people will respond. All it tells me when you say you have a  kd in those games is that you were a pubstar and had no competitive play whatsoever.

For aggressive shotgun play juggernaut striker sunsinger stormcaller and nightstalker are probably the most popular due to their various CQC skill sets. For aggressive sniping I personally prefer bladedancer as blink lets you reposition quickly if you are in a bad spot and QuickDraw is huge for better handling on your sniper plus swapping to your primary for followup on a body shot. I would suggest though that just like picking a single weapon load out for a few days to focus on pick a subclass that you enjoy and have some success with and then find the load out you like better to pair with it and focus on that for a little bit for deliberate practice. ,CruciblePlaybook,d3184v6,2,t5_37lup

7608070,0,t3_4iq4gn,I know Im a little late to this post but Ill point out a few things.Luminosity Wish You Luck and Luckyy amp Buttwipe are all good streamers to check out if youre into shotgunning.But if you really want to get good at shotgunning I suggest you try and play with people above your skill level.A few months ago my brother introduced me to a smaller streamer about  viewers on average who happened to be pretty good and just generally a nice guy. So I followed him and later subscribed to his stream.Now it wasnt like I was paying to play with him. I played with him a few times before I subscribed. Thats just a benefit of seeking out mentors that dont have  viewersday on Twitch. But being a sub definitely gave me some priority over others when he was looking to play with friends. And over time we have actually become real friends.So basically I have played with this guy usually offstream and we will do v or Trials together. He is quite a bit better than me and he routinely offers constructive criticism on my plays and decisions. Its been extremely beneficial to my game so far.Not only that but he has introduced me to a lot of other good players some just via Twitch chat. And those players often have lots of new things to teach me whether they know it or not. Overall this experience has really helped me become a more competitive player.I recommend you try something similar.TLDRI reached out to smaller streamers on Twitch and they became excellent mentors for me. Ive become a much better player since seeking out highskilled mentors. This experience is probably more valuable than simply watching good gameplay.,CruciblePlaybook,d36zxsy,1,t5_37lup

I used to be real bad at it back in Y it was easier because there was a chance youd get bad teams the whole way down the card.Now I think you want to try and play at the most popular times for your location. If youre all up at am youre going to get the people dedicated enough to be on Destiny at that time and they tend to have played a lot lol.Its definitely harder to go flawless now than it used to be. Practice in the week with the same people dont play passive pick and push pick and push.Keep an eye out for enemies on their own. If youre pretty sure someone is on their own callout X is on his own in ltlocationgt and push it with twothree people from different locations. Now its a v. Never let your team go off on their own.If you get two down close to each other defend them and never peek to build up super energy leave one guarding the orbs and play the cap point.You have to take advantages you can get. If youre handed free super energy take it dont push your luck until you are comfortable blitzing teams. It takes a lot of practice.Slide and jump over snipe lanes avoid them as much as possible and push into their locations as fast as possible. For instance in my submission history I asked wtf to do about hardscopers on bannerfall. The answers mostly arent to go out of spawn or B but to use grenades to flush them out by going down alleys and sliding then pushing into mid.Map control and using SITTING to check sniper lanes are two good ways not to get domed.

7738417,0,t3_4laze4,If you neutralize or even capture a zone by yourself but then the enemy team kills you and immediately recaptures said zone you are doing nothing but feeding them more points. Especially if their recapture includes more than one person.If you are on a point see red on your radar but your teammates arent there to help you generally you need to back off to a more advantageous position and try to reclear the area andor wait for backup. Standing on the zone is telegraphing your position  its where those guys coming to shoot your face expect you to be. Be unpredictable!Control is a team game and until youre pulling positive more than youre breaking even with your kd as a rule you need to be sticking with your team. Unfortunately if youre queueing solo this might mean youre going to be on teams that... well dont really know what theyre doing. IMO this can be a learning experience thoughInstead of focusing blindly on the zones practice looking around and trying to read the flow of battle. Try to fill the gaps the silly randoms are creating. Sometimes you can do work just by hanging out by your initial AC to anchor your teams spawn point and punish the other teams blueberries who think theyre so smart by crossing the map and trying to take the opposite point. Just remember its Control not Capture.  Your goal is to make your positioning on the map more advantageous than the other teams. Play the objective but dont be blinded by it.Also just in general... its more important to stay alive than to get kills. Consider how many points are bring awarded for your actions not just for your team but for the enemy as well. Embrace the art of running away!! ,CruciblePlaybook,d3lsvfh,28,t5_37lup

The shots land exactly where I want them to  of the time even out to longmid range.  Its great for teamshooting since you only need  head body for a kill and when I ran trials with a buddy and both of us had TFC anyone that ended up in a v against us would melt pretty quickly.

7757897,0,t1_d3nkaat,Heavy I dont mind it in threes you know when its coming so I usually am able to pick off a couple opponents who run to it. I also like it because it changes the pace of the match and if the other team all grabs heavy and nobody on your team does its not terribly difficult to take out one or two with a super and snipe the third a bit later without them picking up like  easy kills. Obviously a lot easier said than done but even if the worstcase scenario happens its still entirely possible to counter and if your team plays it well you can grab some easy kills and make your opponents waste a super or two. Shotguns Yeah the nerfs kind of kill the whole point of using a shotty.Bullet hoses Yup definitely need a nerf lol no question. I use all different types of weapons I enjoy using Boolean Gemini Red Death NLB Hawksaw and Vex Mythoclast. However when Im not using Doctrine I immediately feel handicapped. Doctrine deals out a bunch of flinch is effective from all ranges has predictable recoil and tons of ammo in the mag. Not to mention an incredibly fast bodyshot ttk. Basically its the best gun you could ever ask for versatile and effective and could definitely use a nerf of at least  damage per shot. Firebolts The most obnoxious thing to fight in the game one nade within m of you and youre useless for the next  seconds. Definitely needs a nerf.Super orbs Idk they promote sticking together as a team and also make a defender titan a lot more useful possibly could tone down the amount of super given but theyre a good concept imoCustom games amp ranked playlists Yes yes yes. There is no reason why I shouldnt be able to set up a custom v match with someone who calls me out during a game of skirmish or something. Also would be very nice to have an ingame ranking system so I dont have to check on destinytracker or something to see how well Im doing and then have the option to just have a casual skirmish game where I dont have to try very hard to keep my rank up.,CruciblePlaybook,d3o0i4m,1,t5_37lup

Headseeker is sort of meh since I think getting your shots to hit in the first place and making it easier to land headshots in the first place is more important than getting  bonus to precision damage on a rd shot of a burst.Glass Half Full I generally reload my gun after every engagement so it makes it sort of meh for my playstyle and it barely adds any damage boost.Some people say Braced Frame is better than HandLaid Stock due to the penalty you take with range on HandLaid Stock which I argue differently on. The range even with HandLaid Stock is still enough to take on MIDA. You could shoot from one side of the bridge to the other on Frontier and still easily hit shots with no drop off. I also find having  rounds has helped me considerably more than the  with braced frame would give me. ,CruciblePlaybook,d3pdvhv,1,t5_37lup

7776769,0,t1_d3q51b7,The shadestep glitch I believe you are thinking of was fixed.  There may be anothernew one for all I know but the one where you could pull out your ghost midshadestep to get control back while still seeming like you were in the shadestep animation was fixed.Latency is really the issue.  An issue that has always been there but is becoming increasingly more of a factor as the player population dwindles down due to lack of new content.  It has been months since Ive played a Trials card though Im admittedly on the casual side of playing Trials where latency hasnt been a huge issue starting at win  or .  This manifests itself in situations like OP described where players do things that seem impossible or just dont take damage when youre clearly hitting them on your screen etc.  My latest pet peeve is latency so bad even when showing green bars that players arent showing up on radar until they are right on top of you even when they were never invisible pseudoinvisible teams full of warlocks or warlocktitan mixes.Destinys design ultra fastpaced high mobility shooter is writing checks that Destinys technology pp servers with some sort of state duplication system that allows it to switch hosts without a CODstyle host migration phase cannot cash.In my experience it hits people somewhat unevenly though.  Ive noticed that my problems with latency in v are actually MUCH WORSE when my fireteam is all local to me.  When I play with others who are far more geographically dispersed we actually get much better connections in reality the connections are likely worse but something about the way Destiny handles lag compensation punishes fireteams full of locals in my experience so playing with people spread out puts you on the good side of their lag compensation.. the side where you feel like you are getting kills you maybe shouldnt have instead of the side where you feel like youre dying when you certainly shouldnt have.Just a little snippet from a game this past weekend ,CruciblePlaybook,d3q5lgz,3,t5_37lup

I think they pair very well.While UR might not be the best option for Defenders with NBP I still believe that the best overall shotgun in the game is UR. The range while ADS is ubsurd it hits hard and fires quick enough to kill someone if the initial shot doesnt ohk. I feel like I often get out ranged by UR when I run my PC. The stats on paper look better for CTD and PC but the ADS range and precision damage on UR cant be understated. The trade off with UR is that you lose a ranged primary which is huge but that aside I still believe its the best shotgun in the game. Best in that slot? Probably not.

So while theres definitely some kind of interaction going on between zoom and range afaik there have been only limited inroads made on checking the more complex facets of the relationship.

You also seemed to shadestep willy nilly at one point you shadestepping straight into a lightning grenade that just landed at your feet and primed you easy enough mistake to make but if you shadestep when you dont need to you cant when you do need to.As he said about jump shots and pulse rifles try out a handcannon and you will see a lot more success,CruciblePlaybook,d40koec,0,t5_37lup

If it makes you overly agressive thats bad but if you can use it when the situations call for it it can be very effective. When were v or v and the enemy had a sniper and is out in a lane hardscoping I know that my shield can tank at least  sniper shot. If I run into the lane first with my team mate following close behind I KNOW we can take him down because my shield will tank the first sniper shot and then we can finish him off even if he gets a headshot on me because my team mate is behind me pushing as well. He cant shoot two people at once unless he gets a double headshot which is highly unlikely and never on purpose.,CruciblePlaybook,d413rum,1,t5_37lup

7927102,0,t1_d46xs9s,tbh the paddles took me a loooong time to get used to because I hadnt realised but its hard to explain I apparently used to hold my controller with my left hand under the controller a lot more than I thought so at first the paddle got horribly in the way.  At that point I hated my Scuf and regretted it and wished Id gotten a BB  like you Id read all the negative online comments.  I think the best thing about the Scuf is its probably fixed me up techniquewise quite considerably.Having done the research on BB at that time I must admit Id love to try them out.  I think it would take some getting used to now that Im used to the paddle  but I think its right to say you can have  buttons or have the two and choose whether they are low or high?  Is that right?  If so thats damn cool.  I could get used to  buttons I reckon.Having said that I can do pretty much everything now without leaving the sticks.  I run Jumper with nade and melee remapped and I have slidecrouch on right paddle and reloadaction on left paddle.  I love that setup.  It means its almost exclusively movement on the left and action on the right except for the paddles which I tried the other way but it didnt seem right.

7988683,0,t3_4ok91f,A very good video and you have a good video speaking voice much more pleasant than listening to obnoxious young guys but I will point out a few things.. Headseeker doesnt do anything on a Grasp due to its low impact high ROF. It only adds  damage to a crit which is marginal and does not change its  burst nature. It also does not lower its TTK. Headseeker is pretty much useless.. Secret Round is the same way as your th shot wont really hit the target if your other ones miss.I do agree with you that Counterbalance and Rangefinder are the two best perks and that Counterbalance is the far superior of the two.HandLaid Stock facts are incorrect. HandLaid Stock infact gives the most stability of any perk on Grasp of Malok. HandLaid Stock gives a whopping  stability  more than Braced Frame and a  range. It also preserves the weapons normal  round magazine. The  range is not an important issue as the vast majority of engagements fall within Grasps range.Ranges at which you MAY see HandLaid Stock start falling off are. Courtyard heavy to snipers nest on Widows Court. Silo special and rock special outside of Bravo on Black Shield.. Bravo teleport gate on Vertigo whilst aiming at either Alpha or Charlie.These are incredibly long ranges and anything short of MIDA wont really be effective anyways at these ranges. At these ranges you are better off pulling out a sniper or better yet not engaging and repositioning yourself for a better shot.A god roll Grasp must have either Braced Frame or HandLaid Stock. A perfect balance isnt too bad but I would highly discourage the use of either smallbore or injection mode the losses outweigh the gains.Completely agree with your final perk slot recommendations on Third Eye and Feeding Frenzy.Ive been using the Grasp of Malok for the past  months in all forms of PVP and sweats. I farmed for this one long before Nightfall and had to do it the old fashion way  hours of farming for one Grasp.My god roll is OES Counterbalance HandLaid Stock and Third Eye.If you play on PS I can help you with further information on this Grasp as I own a few god rolls and several decent ones. Once again good video aside from the HandLaid Stock error.,CruciblePlaybook,d4e0636,2,t5_37lup

8016251,0,t3_4ozhll,Your  example did not make sense to me. His teammate got mowed down his only other choice was to try to primary your teammate who was out of frame for him. Pulling his sniper out really was his only option based on the poor decision he made prior.Your teammate also is not a blueberry he is a guy you play trials with often who is over a .kdr. He challenged the guy on B point and the guy on B point gunned him down while you floated right past it and did not support fire to help him. I would say your team as a whole made a bad tactical fight there where you guys had a v but let it be a v.Just one of the things I noticed in your examples. Overall I think sniping is a hot and cold thing for players. I can be on and hit everything under the sun. Then I have days where its a body shot and cannot hit the head if my life depends on it.

It is up to those players he linked to choose how they feel about being linked judged and denigrated. Ive seen your replies and the core of your argument is that the people linked may take something positive out of it which is beside the point.When a person acts its not up to them to dictate how people concerned will feel about it. Therefore for anyone wanting to do anything ethically correct it is prudent to be mindful of how ones actions may affect the people around him. There is a certain standard born from people who know that while getting the job done is good getting the job done while not stepping on anyone else is even better. This is something EAFM obviously cant quite wrap his head around or he doesnt care too much about either way.Point being dont assume that because there is some positive to take for the people he linked that it automatically means they arent being shamed or that they wouldnt feel shamed about it.

You use it to drive an opponent from behind cover or to break up enemy concentrations.  That opponent you almost finished off ducked behind cover? Dont close with him let the purple balls of death do it for you! And if he bolts gun him down.Theres a group of three opponents holding a hallway and teamshooting the snot out of everything? Time the release and peek the corner just long enough to throw a bundle of chaos seekers in their midst. Break them up get them moving get them separated.

8106940,0,t3_4q8wab,Ive been looking into fusions since the last update and I keep coming back to a single legendary Panta Rhei. Susanoo is great but I want something that can be used on multiple classes. Plan C is amazing but its an exotic. Ashraven is a very solid choice but the recoil isnt vertical. Panta Rhei is a  recoil vertical fairly fast charge  bolt kill that can spawn with  rounds if you have Special chest and Fusion boots. The Crucible Quartermaster sells a version with rangefinder never a bad thing and rifled barrel plus range. All you need to do is learn the charge timing and pull down on the right stick to tighten the burst. Edit You simply cant go wrong with Plan C. Id pick that over any other fusion you might have.

8190880,0,t3_4r9m0u,Not exactly a custom controller but I use the XIM adapter with a mouse and keyboard specifically a Razer Deathadder and Orbweaver keypad. Obviously since the adapter translates mouse motion into right thumbstick output its not true mouse control like youd get on a native PC game but at  sensitivity ingame its as fast or precise as I need it to be for just about any situation. A quick flick of the wrist will spin me  stupidly fast when Im doing the shotgunmelee dance up close but smaller finger motions will fine tune my aim to line up snipes. Plus you can configure separate sensitivity values for hipfire vs. aiming down sights.Some things are sort of awkward notably Sparrow driving but Ill go back and mess around with making separate keybinds for that.Before I got the XIM I used a Cinch PS controller with  buttons located on the grips usable with my middle and ring fingers.

8245441,0,t3_4saljc,You gotta play with your team and learn everything about them. Dont expect to pick up a team and do good. You have to make chemistry learn their weaknesses  their strengths. Know how reliable they are can they go ahead and win that v so you can get the revive or should you tag along? You have to. Team work gtgtgt Gun skill in trials all day long. Also in my opinion heavy round is the most crucial in the game. Its the swaying point. If its  and they win then its . If you win its  and now you have enough time for super. A wasted super against a strong team might be your game loss so be careful. But if a super means a round win dont be scared so use it if its a v and your the last two alive with no revive in sight  which shouldnt happen. I like to tell myself Im a good player when I try. I got the game four months ago and although Im still trying to recover the heavy dent in KD I made as a kinderguardian Im recovering. I have just found a team this week for consistent trials lighthouse runs. At the start we nearly lost against an all silver team. Then when we started to build momentum this happened   We beat a team of triple diamond ranked trials members. We started out strong won heavy round and beat them . It was admittedly not that hard. We team shot stuck to the strat and wiped the floor with them. Make a strat for heavy. Thats crucial. Our defender would place his armor of light bubble right on their heavy and steal it. We stayed at ours and made sure not to challenge the sniper camping near crows nest. My tips are  single out players  and team shoot. Collapse as a v.  watch for other supers and learn to counter them. Smash Nova and Goldy are all hard counters available for each class.  aswell as suppressor nades .  once you get an orb GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE GUARDIAN.  dont get cocky if you see the opponents have bad stats. Its a simply number.  dont get scared if your going up against masters of the crucible. Play smart and be careful.  avoid the  snipe lanes. Snipe from an angle and always make sure you have a bullet for a res snipe.  if your going against good players and you manage to make it a v  dont be scared to farm him a little get special  get some super charge going but dont get ahead of yourselves. Last think you want to see is they get both revives and come back.  this tip is kinda cheap ik but itll save you one day . ,CruciblePlaybook,d588hx3,2,t5_37lup

Most streamers on PS probably do because of the map issue. Im not arguing against going in and saying GG after a match only pointing out why some streamers may have issues with it. Anytime I play a good match even if I lose Ill send a GG over. Unfortunately the dwindling playerbase leads to fewer and fewer good sportsmanship players. As for stream sniping its ridiculous that people get off knowing that theyre gonna try to stomp a streamer who is carrying.

If timed correctly a vanish before going for a revive is the difference between getting the res or not. I personally like snare over envenomed because you can hide them when disengaging from enemies and for setting traps on the objective but those are best used for the  v  game modes.

Trials is all about communication strategy and synergy with your team. Movements and positioning much more thought out. Everyone dies but if youre going to die die in a place thats easier for your teammates to res you. If you want to get better at trials it takes practice. Spend more time playing elimination or skirmish to get used to the flow of the game.

8382241,0,t3_4u6yxk,This was a good read! Im glad that Godfather requested that you repost this here. I have something that I would like to address though.gt Anyways lets talk about the other method preventing the tilt from ever occurring. Now bear in mind this is MUCH easier said than done but you need to internalize EVERYTHING. You cannot blame anyone except yourself for any mistake. Try to always think of something better that you could have done even when someone else is fucking up.For at least the past  months I have been good about not blaming others for my mistakes but my tilt has not gone away. I presume most people tilt at things they have little to no control over but I tilt when I make mistakes. I recognize my error and get mad at myself for making it and since I am then on tilt I make more mistakes as a result and end up spiraling out of control.My question to you is this what would you recommend to players like me regarding tilt?

In those modes you get punished way too much for a new user to learn anything about shotgunning. You dont really get a feel for how maps flow  which is very important  and you dont really learn good angles to push from. v is the best way to train and learn this stuff because you have a little more freedom to discover flanks routes and baiting techniques. A great learning mode is Salvage.

I would take safe approaches at pulling an angle if I couldnt get it then I would rely on my teammates shotuns my skip and tlw to help clean up.I think this strat forces players into an uncomfortable push when the time gets close to capture.

A lot of people I was playing with last night are struggling with handcannons because they keep sealing around their weapons and then would try a Luna they arent really comfortable with and would do it in IB and get discouraged.I think the biggest thing I learned was that HCs are actually very accurate now but they really struggle in s I use mida or hawsaw for s after watching my games I found that ghost bullets now are almost always because you are taking damage from somewhere else flinch causes HCs too go nuts. So in vs like rumble and skirmish so often offer I go HC but in s where Ill be taking some random damage from a guy who sees my foot or shoulder or Im getting hit from a random skip grenade during a gun fight I go hawksaw and sometimes mida. ,CruciblePlaybook,d6l5607,2,t5_37lup

8669165,0,t3_4ynvi5,Id like to add that with sniping in this game youre going to have to do it about every match to keep your skills up. I was a proficient sniper but a  games of shotgunning takes me about  games of sniping or more to get back in the groove. Id say KYS is the best sniper to learn with as it has good ammo inventory is easy to access and is high impact. If youre going to commit to sniping you are going to have to snipe every match and eventually be able to snipe close quarters reliably. This means learning with a QuickDraw low zoom scope is best but obviously will take you a while to get one to drop. I could pull off close quarters quick scopes now and then but to be consistent enough is going to take hours of your time hence this sub recommending shotgunning over sniping. When you get good at sniping you are going to be able to change to different scopes as you get better so dont really worry about learning with a sniper. A summary sniping takes hours of practice and a lot of time to upkeep your skills hence it is suggested you shotgun. Start with KYS and wait for a good roll. ,CruciblePlaybook,d6p9l06,17,t5_37lup

As a general rule I spec armorrecovery and with Titan skating you dont notice the lack of agility.  Running mida also helps make up for low agility.  Armamentarium is my go to exotic mostly because I cant garrison and lightning nades are amazeballs.  One might make an argument for greaves or stand asides to complement shoulder charging but I think the grenades are the strongest in the game and having  is money. uMercules has amazing breakdowns for just about everything but the link above is for good vendor weapons.

9245771,0,t1_d8nnesd,Well it has to be both.  What we normally call skill is actually a multitude of different skills.  We normally think of aim but theres also movement use of cover the list goes on and on.  Ive even found theres differences in aiming.  Im good with hand cannons and scouts but a buddy of mine is excellent with a pulse or AR.  Hes very good at controlling recoil and keeping his reticle on target while Im better at quickly acquiring a target and pulling the trigger as my reticle passes over.  So not only does the quality of gun matter and your general skill level but also how well that setup suits your particular skill set.  I lack the patience for sniping and staying focused for that long so no matter how good a sniper rifle you stick in my hands Ill lose to a dedicated sniper.  On the other hand Im excellent at movement reading my radar constantly and predicting another players mindset making me quite good with a shotgun.  Both of these types of players are skilled but skill in the aggregate sense is quite hard to quantify.So I think its important to know your strengths and have your meta setup for when something is on the line but challenging yourself with something different and outside the meta can yield unexpected results sometimes and develop your weaker skills.  The players outside the meta do us a great service by constantly vetting the unconventional and avoiding group think.One last point changing up training methods is also critical for growth in athletics and other disciplines.  It keeps you mentally engaged in growth.  Even if its just doing a different drill with the same skills it can lead to more positive results than sticking with the tried and true.Sorry for the wall of text.

9335408,0,t3_58cfjy,. I find after about  an hour of playing my gunskill totally plummets. Not just a dip in concentration but I will go negative in every game. Use this time to log off and go outside do some chores ect.. My girlfriend hates destiny! Im probably as addicted as you and I made a few slip ups where I prioritised the game over important. If I was smart I would have made sure all the housework was done alloted couple time and been discreet and I probably could play more but as it stands Im not allowed to play while she is around. This leaves me with an hour before work maybe  days a week and  mins after work the other   shift work so it depends . If I get a half day or day off work Ill spend most of it playing destiny. . My suggestion is work around this golden hour where your perfomance is really good and do some solid games. Your partner will see you get an hour log off and disengage and go and do other things. Use the time your at work or not playing to review your gameplay so when you log on next you can practice on your mistakes. ,CruciblePlaybook,d8zbxkz,1,t5_37lup

9341179,0,t3_58fmcw,Kind of. The best I know is this database  You need to make a copy if you want to take advantage of the calculator. Basically on the sheet  you can select weapon type and and find out what the modifiers are however you need to add those modifiers to base stats manually and then take note of stat caps sheet .  Some of the numbers there are still best guess as they cannot be found out from API directly but are rather trial and error from trying things out.  I use sheet  and  in combination a lot when figuring stuff out. From one you take the perk value and from other the multiplier. E.g. Reinforced barrel adds  range but Shotgun range perk multiplier is . which means it adds  x .   range. And then you see that shotgun range cap is  so even if the math gives you higher result that will be the actual value.  If someone wants to create a weapon calculator the best way to test caps and values would be to gain access to huge user database cooperation with DIM or Ishtar would make sense where you can find the caps out by using large data. And be prepared to put a lot of work into updating it since a lot of things change often with patches.,CruciblePlaybook,d9028om,2,t5_37lup
9341880,0,t3_58e70g,Reinforced is better than Riffled. They both reach the range cap at  but riffled slow the reload where reinforced down the stability. The stability is a non issue on shotgun unless you use a FA shotgun. Also if you pair Reinforced or Riffled with Aggressive Ballistic the benefice of riffled on stability are cancel it.In my opinion the very very godroll for a Matador Y is Aggressive Ballistic Performance  Bonus Reinforced Barrel Rangefinder.Now I have  sweet Matador all of them with Aggressive Ballistic Cascade and Reinforced. One has Rangefinder the second Close andor Personal and the third Crowd Control.The one with Close andor Personal goes always to my Striker. The benefit from Close are so good in the case I have to melee.The one with Rangefinder is always with all my characters and are my go to in trials for my Stormlock and Nightstalker.The last one is fun in Clash or Control or Rift. ,CruciblePlaybook,d905fhv,1,t5_37lup

Counterbalance will change the pattern of the burst to nearly vertical and actually increases the recoil. Id run it with Handlaid stock to increase that stability which tightens the burst to make it a laser. With Full auto just be careful when placing those bursts. Sounds alright for PvE too.

Trying to snipe isnt bad if thats what you are seeking to improve that aspect of your game but it sounds like you are correlating improvement with winning so sniping is a hindering you there. snipers in rumble lobbies typically have the exact game that you described. I dont care much for the playlist but my friend loves it top  on xbox and runs fusionshotty but uses primary the most. My last two tips are to check out Wishs youtube videos on how to win rumble map specific as well as keen koalas CR interview on spawning in and using cover.

9460600,0,t3_5a8z5x,Speaking from experience a god rolled party crasher with AB rifled barrel and rangefinder isnt as good as a matador with just AB and max range even without rangefinder. Its just more consistent. Also matador y has a decent perk pool so the chances of getting a good one are considerably higher. The ONLY reason to grind for a PC is if you want the infinite ammo roll of rescue mag with performance bonus or replenish. Which I also have and is great for games where special ammo is scarce and you still have the possibility of getting one from the classic playlists. But its always going to loose out at range to decent matadors. ,CruciblePlaybook,d9f755a,1,t5_37lup

9488407,0,t3_5alpgp,Id go ahead and definitely suggest going to Striker. Sunbreaker has its upsides and its got a good super but the neutral game is just not good enough.Striker has a fantastic neutral game on the other hand and FoH is a very powerful super if you know how to use it. The only solar nade I can really recommend is stickies just because the other  are not really that great. By contrast all  Arc nades are totally viable choices. Pulse grenades are a solid and simple to use AoE DoT option for zoning that can just be chucked with little thought. Flashbangs are a nasty way to prime players who are not ready for that blindness and the momentary panic can lead to an opening for you to wreck if things go well. Then the king is the Lightning the hardest to use but damn it is monsterous at area denial and lets you finish off people who think they are safe in cover if you can get the placement right.Melee is just straight stronger and can still have at least a chance of being immediately refunded or switched to an AoE if thats your poison. Also Transfusion lets you heal via melee.SC and Jugg shield are gnarly special abilities for highly aggressive play though they can be very tempting to use when they are just going to get you killed. And then theres fist of Havoc. Most players run like hell when an enemy super is popped but not you. You shut that shit down like Lucille. Mob of enemy players? Fist. Heavy ammo grab? Fist. Dudes got heavy? Fist. Bout to die in a close game? Fist. Bored? Fist. Bubble Troll? Fist. Palpatine? Blade? Sunbro? Fist. Fist. Fist. Golden Gun?  Fiok this guys probably got your number.

9490963,0,t3_5apicf,Aside from the ones you use most I would prioritize the ones where in light level enabled playlists  damage could make the difference in number of bullets to kill. For example if you use both palindrome and hawksaw I would infuse palindrome to be the highest since a loss of  damage is more impactful to the number of bullets to kill  vs.  for palindrome as opposed to the damage drop off on  to  per bullet on the pulse wont change the number of shots to kill. Id think that shotguns and fusions would be prioritized over snipers since it could impact the number of buckshotsbolts required to kill and a sniper will always ohko with a headshot. People are also now generally too high in light level to ohko to the body now for it to be worth upgrading a high impact sniper if for that reason. ,CruciblePlaybook,d9iypvg,3,t5_37lup
9494219,0,t3_5as9rb,I had this idea as well the moment I saw the arc version of the Felwinter Artifact a couple weeks back. I honestly think it would be really effective. Stormcaller has one of the best neutral games. Nothing compliments a well rolled Matador than that ridiculous  meter melee. Also not having a super allows you to run FeedbackPulsewave over Transcendence and Arc WebPerpetual Charge over Electrostatic Mind.

Its base stability is so high the grouping is tight enough! And also sometimes accelerated coil wouldnt hurt the bolts required to kill with a thesan so accelerated was better than braced for thesan and this was widely accepted as the common CP opinion. I never really got into work my accelerated and not braced frame thesan always felt like garbage and eventually I just started using the infamous iron banner god roll ashravens if not the plan c.

9555050,0,t3_5bq2yg,Monitor especially if you play on a TV that doesnt have settings to mitigate display lag. There are a bunch of great p monitors out there right now at good prices because K monitors are attracting more and more buyer attention. If you do not plan on upgrading to a PS Pro or next year Scorpio a p monitor will be a great fit. I got a p monitor last year and while the reduction in display lag isnt wasnt immediately overwhelmingly apparent I did start to notice little things here and there like winning more close gun battles or getting contested snipes more often. Its not so overwhelming that is absolutely necessary to get a monitor but I cant say it doesnt help.Remember though that it isnt the rifle its the rifle man. A monitor will not magically turn you into a PVP god. Thats up to you.If you do decide to get a monitor do your research. They are not all created equal. I got a BenQ  because it prioritized rendering speed over image quality. Not that the picture is bad its excellent but certain monitors are better for gaming than others.Im actually looking at K monitors right now to replace my current monitor because I have a PlayStation Pro on the way and I do plan to get Scorpio next year.

9562023,0,t1_d9rjbkx,Glad to see that someone is working on the AutoPulse numbers as those are the main ones that I still have a lot of uncertainty on. Also great thinking to use perks like Glass Half Full and Headseeker to narrow down the possible ranges even further I dont think I would have ever gone to that level of depth. Im always happy to talk shop and although I created this spreadsheet awhile ago I should still be fairly fresh on where I got all my numbers from. As far as my HP numbers go Im pretty confident with the HP values from  armor. It starts getting tricky above  though and I believe Im on my third or fourth iteration of the HP value function for  armor. Ive done some testing for  and  armor values and so far the current function holds true for the tests Ive done on those armor values. I havent really done any testing on  or higher armor higher being temporarily achievable using weapons like Boolean Gemini or Quantiplasm so those are purely theoretical although there didnt seem to be any instances in Fallouts video that disprove the current number I have for  armor.

Why would there always be a split such as x s y s where x and y are constant. Thats definitely not a simple pelletDamage  ceiltotalDamage  . My sofarunproven hypothesis is that bungie has a piece of code that takes that total damage number and splits it into  parts.And what the hell is the shotgun crit multiplier?

9568945,0,t1_d9sf2rm,I dont think I can help you  the Saladins Vigil crowd doesnt listen to me anymore. I say range they say stability.I say accel coils because you need a faster charge to deal with the rapid movement in this game and that you will die trying to get a slow charge off more often than you would leave someone barely alive after landing  bolts with accel coils and dying before you can finish them with your primary. Which makes it a bad perk on balance because it gets you killed more than it gets you kills. They say the only thing that matters is bolting people.I say you get better bolt registration with Vestige Ashravens Panta and Plan C.

9809456,0,t3_5fmgxz,excellent post!  for players trying to improve we dont often see improvements since the game situations change constantly quality of opponents changes quality of connections changes. these things make improvement harder to see even if youre checking stats and recording and watching games. sometimes it can feel like youre even going backwards! im sure many of us can relate to that.   things that are really really important to me to keep this in perspective are   what youve pointed out above assessing performance in different areas on a scale not as just good or bad. keeping a list of these things by date could be really open up the reality of improvement and   what youve pointed out which is SO critical that improving one area requires collateral focus and attention to other areas that are related like the factors in improving shot placement and   that while we may see improvement in these things slightly over time together since they are all part of the same integrated pie we will actually improve in leaps and bounds when our mind and body are able to integrate the information AND put it to use in execution. we need to narrow our focus and drill in order to get the muscle memory and brain function we need. however when we improve we are really suddenly seeing a different player come to the table.  we dont really improve a little bit at a time but thats all we can focus on. we dont have control over when we take these quantum leaps of improvement but we SURE do see them when they happen!!!  that said i think your approach to keep focused on the journey of improvement has no downsides at all! the hardest part is how to keep focused during the training periods keep motivated while we are trying to play the way we know we can amp should but arent able or ready to just yet...,CruciblePlaybook,dam84sk,2,t5_37lup

One big one is the most skilled guy flat out refuses to follow a plan and likes to be a wild card. This works out sometimes but is frustrating to work around and against good teams we get picked apart. Blaming teammates is a poor excuse in my book but you guys have made good points about the benefits of playing with same skilled mates that are on the same page. I guess I may need to broaden horizons when it comes to teammates but I also think I have much room to improve. I hear the  flawless guy with the tips.

9968492,0,t1_db6thbl,You should do it incremental.E.g. before we start a new weekend of Trials we load into a private match min  min of walking around going through those callouts and min playing freeforall and giving out our positions constantly and go through every little corner  that way all your team mates know the basic callouts. At first we use these standard callouts like those youll see on callout maps. But if you know the map well you start to make more detailed callouts. So instead of simplay saying  man somwhere at zone A you start to say something like  man near zone A at the heavy box. Next step would be additions like movement his weapon and so on gt  titan crouching near zone A at heavy hardscoping towards zone B and solwly moving forward maybe this sounds too much for a callout but putting the infos into the right order and make them as detailed as possible can even put weak team mates in an advantage over your opponents. The more you and your guys play together the more detailed your callouts will be. We even make up new names for areas that we think might be important but are not listed in callout maps.

10020092,0,t1_dbdmo8g,I would have to argue that it is far easier to reach a decent level with Striker than it is storm caller. Firstly in terms of how forgiving shotgunning is on both classes the Striker has Juggernaut to allow him to close the gap far easier and provided the shield is still up shoot first. But of course there isnt that much difference here because as you said the shotgun melee combo of the storm caller is very forgiving also.Secondly the lightning grenade allows for stronger zoning with far less accuracy needed to zone an area off effectively. Plus it has far more killing potential than both arcbolt and stormLastly the super it is far easier to use FOH effectively in s due to the fact that they are very easy to land give added armour and can shutdown other supers all of which require little skill. Whereas Stormtrance you have to consider where to activate what supers they have to shut you down and learn to effectively bait with the use of blink. ,CruciblePlaybook,dbdn9ky,4,t5_37lup

10056753,0,t3_5jqvu2,Im only going to make a couple notes and then a general Things to work on here Your death at ish is because youre standing in a terrible position. Its a choke point your outs are into open spaces with high traffic. You also tossed a grenade all willy nilly into horseshoe just before this. Death at around  youre in a better position but when the enemy appears you throw your grenade. Radar told you enemies were there I would have prenaded and likely end up with a double shoot the first guy grenade gets the second instead of a trade. Dont panic so much when rushed you also could have simply switched weapons and taken a step back. The enemy had low health shotgun would have cleaned him up from a mile away. At  an enemy makes a correct play on you by grenading before engaging. It caused you to flee in a panic and you turned the wrong way out the door. Axions are annoying for sure but dont panic! You could have jumped down the ramp and slid under them engaging at a head glitch and using your own grenade to soften. Turn the tables on people who chase that hard! Some of your best play is  to  even though you died in the end. You correctly engaged and cleaned up a fight then created a little space to see what the enemy was doing before engaging again. You ended up on the wrong side of it but you cant win them all Guardian.  shows good patience with the Stormtrance and reading the radar for the shotgun kill. Immediately after you see a lot of red on your radar and seem to panic again then get a shotgun in the back. In that situation where you know a lot of enemies are in horseshoe just back outside or go through the tunnel to the big room.General Tips for Improvement Work on playing a little calmer and feel confident when you engage. Go wreck some Dregs to get in the mood if you have to. Grenade usage. A lot of players misuse grenades. They are for softening a target for engagement cleaning up a target that is hiding in a predictable location or covering your tracks so you can escape. When radar says someone is in the next room over lob that Axion into the middle and then peek the corner. Dont expose yourself and then grenade. Try to play off corners more often and keep your back to the wall. If you lose a firefight so be it but dont get caught with your pants down. Being shot in the back is the worst feeling because you never got to shoot back.,CruciblePlaybook,dbif3wp,3,t5_37lup

I noticed I had the same scenario happen to me with my sniping a while ago I couldnt res snipe my drags were wrong hard scoping all the wrong times... The whole shebang. I got so frustrated with trials that by the time Sunday came I couldnt even play. I put my controller down till Tuesday and at reset I switched off Nightstalkersniper and started playing Gunslingerfusion. I did the nightfall ran the Kings Fall and played my weekly crucible shenanigans with this loadout and had a blast. I took odd fm try had pants sat back and had fun on something that was foreign to me and let my mentality reset for a few days. I slowly worked my way back into sniping and Ive been here ever since. It may not happen as quickly for you and it may not be the answer you need but it certainly helped me. Dont forget were all in a bit of a frustrated place with destiny pvp at the moment.

There is one part I disagree with Always holding down orbs. Certainly if it is a three v one and youre on the orb hold it down. But many times people will get a grenade kill around a corner and start rushing to the orb from halfway across the map if they are out of sight and surrounded by two teammates around a corner and you dont have a good idea of their positioning just get in a better spot to attack dont rush the orb.

If you dont have a favourite scope then try one of the  mentioned in this post. Lots of people also like Tacsys so if thats your favourite dont feel pressured to change.If youre running Bladedancer with Quickdraw or Warlock with Ophidian Aspects youll want snapshot on your sniper. For anything else quickdraw is preferred.Next step is hidden hand. I wouldnt trade hidden hand for any of the other perks in this tree.The final perk is preference.

10332604,0,t1_dcf4gun,I cant remember which game it was but I remember playing an FPS that changed the reticle size based on what it was targeting and many have a mechanic that distinguishes between friendlies or enemies.Especially with hitscan weapons it seems like the reticle could change size based on the range of the object the reticle is resting on. For example if your reticle is on something m away the reticle would reflect the size of the accuracy cone at m.Given that Bungie seems to prefer keeping a lot of the mechanics under the hood instead of out in the open its not likely they do it...just giving an example of how it looks. I think Newsk once said that in their development build they have the ability to make the cone visible...so a lot of the grunt work is already done. ,CruciblePlaybook,dcf9b03,1,t5_37lup

Face opponents with overshields Con unfavourable gunfights. Use super to destroy bubble Con Waste super  generate more orbs for opposing teamBubble is also a fast charging super and you begin building your super energy the second your bubble is dropped ie. not before your bubble deactivates. It also provides two large orbs for your teammates there are different sized orbs which isnt common knowledge which perpetuate a super train. This is a subjective matter but continous supers doesnt seem like a skillful display of our most talented player base in Destiny. Furthermore the bubble blocks off chokepoints that are essential for some scrim playlists like zone control making it even more potent.Even if you disagree and Id truly love to hear counters to my points above so I can counter it scrims I play in to say it makes absolutely no sense is a bit far fetched IMO.,CruciblePlaybook,dct4y5x,1,t5_37lup

10862964,0,t3_5v9kwo,Interesting this comes up so much lately... I think as others have said as well strafe to make your shots is the main priority. The objective of your strafe should be to seize optimal positioning to win the fight youre in now or escape it or win the fight youll be in next. I will say you might throw off a weaker opponent once with some crouch squat nonsense but it isnt about winning the one gun fight it is about winning all of them.Only at lower levels does strafing to counter the opponents aim mean much. Ive been playig FPS a lot time Destiny is my first and only console shooter but in my ies I played as competitively and pro as you could back then. One easy metric to to judge then was Quake s CPMA mod which was the competitive default. In CPMA your hit  was shown for all weapons for the most part only  weapons really mattered and one of those  one was AoE so the hit rate isnt worth examining. Everyone at the upper tiers had roughly the same hit   for Lightning trackscan weapon and  for Rail sniperish. Quake  makes Destiny look like its standing still but still the upper tiers of play all managed this level of aim. If someone got hot in a tournament you might see  ranges but youd see tournaments won at even  ranges. I know CS. given that it was a little slower the hit rate for pro level play likely approached .In this environment the key function of movement was to get an advantage on your opponent be it a favorable position or use movement in a way that provided you advantage in terms of denying them resources. Thinking you could make them miss was a fools errand so you thought about how you could kill them and get the next as quickly as possible.For Destiny and its ultra slow TTK I think most movement should be to position yourself in a way that allows you to control your exposure. If TTK is ultra slow most gun fights will end in the parties disengaging and little more. So ideally I want to be positioned in a way that lets me leave the fight if I so choose while creating a situation that doesnt give you the same choice. To me for Destiny thats the ideal movement of which strafe is one tool to achieve.,CruciblePlaybook,de0fs6y,19,t5_37lup

11438259,0,t3_638pw0,Average player here carried to get my Blind Perdition Adept. I also have a max stability hidden hand hammer forged Hawksaw which I prefer to the vendor version.The Hawksaw is superior at very very long ranges and the BP at everything else. You cannot underestimate the highlighting scope. It cuts down on your reaction time which can be very significant. The adept version has snapshot built in which further shaves time off your engagement and lets face it with two good players its normally the first to headshot which wins the engagement. The BP has some secret sauce built in which I notice makes me win close range engagements which my hacksaws lack. As if all the bullets are connected by an elastic band and always find their mark if within range. Also if you dont have counterbalance on Hawksaw I found that using the  scope really reduces the bullet spread. Hope this helps.,CruciblePlaybook,dfsiktv,3,t5_37lup

11529626,0,t3_64i3oo,Maybe team up with another good player and carry them one at a time?Even the best Destiny players will struggle to double carry now.Trials is basically an entirely different game at win  than it is at  so I think you may be getting tricked into thinking you just need to get over one last hump but that hump is actually a giant mountain.,CruciblePlaybook,dg2vvfs,1,t5_37lup

11569237,0,t1_dg6l4zc,gtinstead of getting crits you should focus on your first shot being a crit and the rest being follow up body shotsThis is a great way to leave your enemy at  health and die a lot of the time now. You need to learn C B anyway and you need to learn to be real good at positioning.Shot spamming is not something you ever want to tell someone in the position of the OP. Decent players do H and the B spam because they have enough muscle memory to know how to do that and know positioning. Those players are happy chaining headshots at longer range pacing shots cover dipping..OP needs to first learn to aim properly and under pressure then he can learn what shortcuts are appropriate.,CruciblePlaybook,dg7dn1b,3,t5_37lup

The arcblade dance is the true blade dance.But to your question I would go FrstEE with T STR and Felwinter to get maximum backstabs. Khepris is another option as others have mentioned although it doesnt do it for me for some reason. ,CruciblePlaybook,dgeuz37,8,t5_37lup

11668138,0,t1_dgilbfg,We were both Voidwalkers though I switched to Sunsinger a few games later  at that time we were both using voidfangs to try and steer the enemy where we wanted them to go. This also backfired. I was running Blind Perdition Adept  the latest vendor Wormwood  my teammate was running Burning Eye Adept  Matador.It was really just odd. Weve gone flawless countless times in the past  but we just couldnt get a win no matter what we did. The guy with the Parthian shot was two bursting us each time. And he was always at a sliver of health. Bah. We even got bested by some level  with an unleveled up Continental.,CruciblePlaybook,dgilknq,1,t5_37lup

11673182,1,t1_dgig5di,Now we have basically three tactics specials that manipulate ammo supply one of the  competitive primaries Palindrome being most popular or abusive neutral game powers.  Its atrociously limited.Before we had basically two tactics abusively overpowered primary weapon Thorn or whatever replaced it in the Meta or snipershotgun cheese.  That was ALSO atrociously limited.But now the only people playing Trials are the people that liked the previous atrociouslylimited playstyle.  So the current atrociouslylimited playstyle seems uniquely bad but its not.  Its just the same old thing in a different wrapper.Im going to keep playing sixes where the fun and the action live.,CruciblePlaybook,dgj66gj,3,t5_37lup

11794545,0,t3_67w73d, I would like to know the answer to this too.  I have read through the comments below and I can assure you they are all wrong. I created a second account for my son. I used a level  level booster. The crucible weekly and quartermaster bounties were unlocked on that character. Ive since finished leveling  that character to . I created a second character on that account. The character is currently level  but does not have any bounties unlocked. Im guessing they will unlock when I reach level .  Im positive they were unlocked before level . I did all the weeklies and quartermaster Bonny is on the first character with mostly green and blue weapons.,CruciblePlaybook,dgwy9mw,1,t5_37lup
11796223,0,t1_dgx4dab,Bungie is the one conflating most used with needs a nerf.Replace banned with nerfed and you get every meta since . as a BungieTM nerf is effectively a ban at a . lobby or higher. Its their poor design regardless of who they listen to. gtNerfing a tactic simply because it is the best isnt even warranted. That only reduces the game to all the second best tactics which isnt necessarily any better of a game than the original game. In fact its often worse!It does not matter what average players say needs nerfing. If you listen to people who dont know how to play your game that is entirely your fault.They actively do NOT listen to vocal players. They are the ones assailing them on twitter about weak primaries and skill gaps etc. They have even said there is a silent majority whose opinions they apparently try to take into account. Multiple times.,CruciblePlaybook,dgx54h1,1,t5_37lup
