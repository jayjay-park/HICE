4471471,1,t3_3ccjp1,What Wizards is referencing here is the right to refuse service.  That right in the US is not absolute.  It does not allow for a refusal of service based upon individual circumstances rather it has to be general policy guidelines such as no sex offenders no new customers  minutes from closing time no cheaters or no anything else outside of a few protected classes like race and gender.  Wizards cannot cite their policy to say no Zach Jesse but must instead cite no insert group hes a part of.  Furthermore they have to make a good faith effort to enforce that policy fairly rather than single out a specific person.This is why SCG couldnt deny Bertoncini from reentering tournaments once his ban was up when everyone knew he would cheat again.  Instead they had to wait to catch and ban him again unless they had drafted a policy of something like no former cheaters.,zjcontroversy,csuaw9d,1,t5_38z5h

4476904,0,t1_csuyk0n,Its all good.  I barely know how to turn on a computer so believe me I have a lot of respect for what you do.The gist is basically that one can have raped someone and not necessarily have been convicted of the criminal offense Rape.Mr. Jesse is a perfect example of this.  His actions constituted a rape both per the relevant criminal definition and a common use definition.So truth would be a very complete defense here.  Because he did literally rape his victim.Now onto your next point about the pedo.  This is going to be a lot of legalese.  Defamation varies state by state but it usually consists of something like . a defamatory statement that . is false . that the defendant was at fault to make . that caused harm.So you need all four of those things to have a successful claim.  In most cases and would almost certainly be the case with your pedo example the fact finding would likely revolve around fault.Fault is a negligence test.  So were looking at a reasonableness standard so we can arrive at a fact specific conclusion of whether the person acted with due care.  I realize thats pretty opaque.  But consider your example again.  If the defendant had no reason to believe that our example plaintiff is a convicted pedo theres almost certainly fault.  And the more reason the less likely theres fault.,zjcontroversy,csuzeu5,10,t5_38z5h
4480842,0,t1_csvcy9f,Thats all speculation. Wizards hasnt said anything other than addressing community concerns in regards to his ban. We cant be sure why he was banned.,zjcontroversy,csvh70q,0,t5_38z5h
4489462,0,t1_cswjtvx,We still dont have a rule at my old work place requiring us to ban clients who sleep with employees wives. Funny how that works. Its almost as if were allowed to bar people on an individual basis.Tell ya what. Next time a violent rapist goes on to post a  page screed about how hes so tough and strong to overcome that time he mistakenly anally and vaginally raped a young woman and WotC doesnt ban him then we can have outrage. Until then no pattern has been broken. Zach has been judged on his actions.Honestly check when your local library is holding free legal consultations. Talk with an attorney with familiarity with HR law you might learn somethings.,zjcontroversy,cswk3t9,0,t5_38z5h

4510735,1,t1_csz6y3i,Maybe its over the top for people to compare the mods to Stalin. But it is actually useful including for the mods themselves to ask WWSD What Would Stalin Do? if in an alternate universe he was the moderator of a ccg subreddit instead of the deceased dictator of a massive country. If you find the two of yourselves You and Papa Joe arriving at a similar  course of action you may want to think about why.,zjcontroversy,csz85j3,-2,t5_38z5h
