8821740,0,t1_d77wni1,I wish Ryuuma had a little more presence in the arc. He was cool.Lol really? I dont play Brook I had no idea. Funny how that works out.A joge buri is usually performed with a single step forward but the range will come out of a shockwave not the step animation.Aside from the obvious fact that a joge buri with proper footwork couldnt be performed midair hes already got the two aerials and a midair performance would be a little harder to hit but also much less punishable if dodged or avoided. Furthermore even if you were to hit a weak aerial which is designed to hit closer to the ground because of its slowness even if used at the apex a joge buri wouldnt be as effective as a unique aerial for comboing between a weak aerial and Specialweak since its slower to come out and though I admittedly didnt elucidate this staggers less than a unique aerial. While trying to make this character good a high levelstechnically demanding to play I gave him good moves that require situational knowhow and precise timingmind game skill. The point of the charged ranged unique is the latter.HGBs are good hits to land and I feel should be aesthetically rewarding. Especially for such an aesthetically kickass character.So the Polka Remise is designed to be a gamble of a balance. Its punishable at long range and cant be spammed it has a long startup and obviously a long cooldown. So high riskreward. The long startup makes it dodgeablestoppable even within range so it has to be comboed into carefully. You can use it at lower percents if you like but must do so knowing that youll probably be punished badly. The pro use of Polka Remise is to use it at the end of an opponents health bar especially on the last character to avoid punishment. Its not for neutral and its one of the moves that requires situational knowhow. But I see your argument.Glad you like the counter!The end of the ultimate will close in on Ryuuma with a smaller background view of the opponent being slashed.Thanks!,BurningBlood,d7892wc,2,t5_3eorn
