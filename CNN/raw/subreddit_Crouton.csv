I just tried it again and maybe its unique to the Acer  or something but CTRLALTFORWARD goes to the Developer Console but the same thing with SHIFT added goes back to xfce.  Im just glad I finally got it working. Also your guide is the best! Because it doesnt just stop with getting xfce up and running like almost all the other guides out there but also provides detailed easytofollow instructions for getting all the other stuff that we need!

6812755,0,t3_48yawa,The issue is that all the stable versions of Ubuntu are based around the . LTS trusty build. The Intel driver package recently relegated . to  unsupported status  so now drivers have to to installed manually. Theres a slew of guides with the repos you should add to get it working. Ive done this process using Unity XFCE and KDE. Unity definitely worked the best out of all three  but it wouldnt let me hot swap between Linux and ChromeOS Id get a black screen issue. ,Crouton,d0oiu3l,3,t5_2yv5a

9140998,0,t3_53zzwv,I found an answer!  This was irrationally driving me nuts as well.  After some deep plumbing of the internet I found an explanation thats kind of above my head here  It comes down to though changing the command you use to run Chrome to force it to use its own password for verification rather than the systems.  I opened the Chrome icon properties and on the third tab under command I pasted the person who replieds entire flag stringgtuserdatadirhomemayur.configgooglechromebeta flagswitchesbegin enabletcpfastopen enablespellingautocorrect flagswitchesend passwordstorebasicDoing that when launching now my Chrome account doesnt require verification anymore!
