4571573,0,t1_ct6tz0w,Yeah I think if I did what you did Id have to skip those segments. I think its cool and ambitious what Ira tries to do in melding all types of stories and Im sure there are people who like it but the fiction just never works for me personally.,ThisAmericanLife,ct6uvhx,1,t5_2qpvk

6670972,0,t3_46y7sh,It made me sad when he said the reason he gets upset about Bernie Sanders ideals is because he worked hard to get where he was and he didnt like that Sanders supporters thought it was okay to distribute wealth.His story would be fantastically different if he hadnt been adopted.  While I have no doubt he is a strong  year old and has certainly suffered for his convictions he would have had to work a hell of a lot harder to rise from the foster system to a fancy law school.  Luck and a womans love and kindness has raised him past a good deal of challenges he might have to overcome without his adopted parents.  ,ThisAmericanLife,d09c3t5,67,t5_2qpvk
6677828,1,t1_d09agf2,Its based on the prevailing and highly offensive premise that someone is defined by their sexuality. If youre gay then thats all you are a gay person.

7069338,0,t3_4c82fm,This episode is probably one of my favourites. Great slices of life with first party crashing story. Really interesting perspective on history with the second. Liked hearing Ira be interviewed someone I hear all the time but dont know that much about because hes always presenting a different story. The alzheimers story was gutwrenching. Chana makes a great host and would love to see her at the head of her own podcast.,ThisAmericanLife,d1ho7iv,5,t5_2qpvk

9556375,0,t1_d9qz679,gtA particular classified email was marked unclassified in two places. Obviously it still should have been considered classified but do you really expect  mistakefree compliance with the system from anyone? Thats why the revocation of classified privileges is never automatic. The details matter.Like anyones worried about a Confidential paragraph.gtIts also established that her intent wasnt anything nefarious.I remember when I said it was and that it made a difference.gtSo whats your point? Do you disagree that she shouldnt have been criminally charged?Nope.gtDo you agree that she should not have been criminally charged but you think her classified privileges should be revoked?Oh hey the one relevant sentence in your post..gtI love how in your analretentive and pedantic parsing of a sarcastic comment you completely miss the point.Considering thats literally my original point its an important distinction to make.And considering Hillarys punishment for mishandling classified material is a likely successful Presidential bid Im dont think shes much of a cautionary tale.,ThisAmericanLife,d9r0pwo,3,t5_2qpvk

11337798,0,t1_dfh3zei,He could be lying he could also have some mental disorder or deficiency. He certainly wasnt painting an accurate picture of what its like to walk down the street as a male. Trust me Ive walked down all sorts of streets for several decades. Not once have I ever encountered what he described as a regular occurrence. Even if he did experience something like that it has nothing to do testosterone levels. This American Life should have recognized that. ,ThisAmericanLife,dfh4bjc,5,t5_2qpvk
