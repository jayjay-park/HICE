7095245,0,t1_d1kkr3a,Apparently the email was sent by a woman supposedly representing the Clark County Democratic Party. The email came from her personal email account it is highly suspect. Here is what she posted on FB Las Vegas Nevada for Bernie Sanders  Christine L Kramar  Calmdown. I am the person who sent out the email. There is not a fix. I seriously have been cutting and pasting the same Sanders information into the emails that I was supplied by the campaign. I have worked my ass off as an unpaid volunteer for the last  weeks to put this together. How about you Google me.  I am not part of the establishment and as a longtime community organizer my goal is to bring people together. This is the second convention I have operated the credentials on and this is NOT a change from  and we dont want the nightmare that was our  convention all over again. We learn from our past mistakes and do this all in our free time out of love for our community.,NevadaForSanders,d1km69u,2,t5_381dw

7129307,0,t1_d1ohk2e,Yes. Either online or in line before am Saturday registration sheets were being passed around. They said National delegate but I was told by the woman distributing them when she caught me at  that they were being used for the state too. Assuming enough of those came in a certain amount will be chosen as State delegates and the rest would be alternates. This thread is the lobby for that list now. Hopefully first of us to catch it comes back and links it in here. ,NevadaForSanders,d1oisv9,1,t5_381dw
