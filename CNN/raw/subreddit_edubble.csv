9559205,0,t3_59vkh6,Since everyone is giving their two cents on this album Ill do the same.This album kind of reminds me of FWT Janky and The Grey in a sense that its very different from his usual content. Like uCOYBIG said it has a big focus on stuff like getting high and while I personally dont mind that the style doesnt fit Edub IMO. However I enjoyed this album overall and would say that it lived up to the hype. to me Olly Olly Oxen Free War Of Attrition and Graceland stick out as the best tracks on the album the rest of the songs vary from good to decent Another track I want to talk about is Heat Five OHH. Its so different from every other track hes made including the rest of TTR. I cant quite identify if its Trap or something else but its very different and I kinda like it to be honest.,edubble,d9rd9ol,5,t5_2ro0f

No other verses were reused. Also Im thinking of trying to figure out the lyrics of the old version for all to enjoy.,edubble,deywap3,2,t5_2ro0f
