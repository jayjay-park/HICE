3290215,0,t3_2xs746,There are a few shops where you can get a decent off the shelf instrument but theyre very few. Rikhiram in Delhi are generally good but very expensive even though they are brought in from Kolkata which is why most of businesses outside of India dont import them. I know of one shop in Varanasi that has cheaper but good sitars and the owner is a player and honest guy. Other than than you might consider trying to commission one from a good maker if theres time. If your friend has no sitar experience then you want to be sure and get something playable thats fitted right so that leaves out  of what hell find available. Shipping is around  INR for Express mail  its less for parcel post but the larger cities wont allow sitars via the mail due to dimensional rules. These rules are waived for smaller cities. So bigger cities its around  INR for FedEx plus fumigation and certificates generally a good idea for Oz but faster service. An equally important concern is packing whether hes shipping or carrying it back if its not packed well it will break. For shipping it also has to be packed well on the outside to avoid shock damage. If hes going to Varanasi then you can PM me is it possible here? Not sure how Reddit works exactly and Ill hook you up. I dont buy from him but he has been my friend for a long time...If you want to go the net route then I can also help you but its a little more expensive although much less hassle and guaranteed quality. Hopefully others here will have some input on other cities too.,Sitar,cp3b7b8,1,t5_2s5vv

6736327,0,t3_47ljyh,Im pretty new at the sitar too and I have a tendency to want to frail too. Fortunately the techniques are different enough that I dont accidentally start playing clawhammer sitar. Gotta love the similarities with the drone string though. Some days I look at it and wonder if I could start Scruggs style pickin.,Sitar,d0g3f07,2,t5_2s5vv
