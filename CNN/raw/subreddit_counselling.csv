8919274,0,t1_d78zjm6,thanks...things have gotten better. I like the counsellor and she is very understanding about my having a hard time opening up so i think shes been taking things slowly and she backs off if she sees Im too uncomfortable.To answer your question no Im not much of a talker in general anyway especially about things that bother me. ,counselling,d7jysom,1,t5_2wdr5
