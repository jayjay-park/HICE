While it seems troubling that the US and EU countries are accepting flights from African countries known with the outbreak to have only a handful of cases between every EU country Australia and the US is well worthy of note. I think the only country that appears to have a bit of an issue is Spain and thats just due to their proximity and lack of medical care and even then its not like the country is seeing anything extremely notable.Hell when you put the entirety of the African outbreak into real perspective  people being infected out of over  million people between GuineaSierra LeonaLiberia it doesnt seem that bad. Not trying to downplay how awful it is but it could be much much worse and the measures taken by the governments and doctors in those countries have done a whole lot to contain it.

Oscillates well though the angle only seems to be about a ish degree angle. But it is remote controlled which is handy as hell.  at Home Depot. If you dont feel thats cheap then look for a nonremote version because its a really good style of fan in my opinion. At work in my cubicle Ive got something similar to this little fan which is less than . I dont remember the exact brand because it was a gift but even on the low setting mine is still pretty powerful. The only drawback is that the airflow is very narrowly focused at least in a small space like a cubicle. So I have to keep it aimed in my specific direction or its like its not even on.

No ones arguing that.As someone who is a scientist who studies rCFBs I am telling you specifically in science no one calls rCFBOffTopics rCFBs. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying rCFB family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of College Football which includes things from rcfbball to rcfbcirclejerk to rcfbanalysis.So your reasoning for calling a rCFB a rCFBOffTopic is because random people call the college sports ones rCFBs? Lets get rCollegeBasketball and rcollegebaseball in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A rCFBOffTopic is a rCFBOffTopic and a member of the rCFB family. But thats not what you said. You said a rCFBOffTopic is a rCFB which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the rCFB family rCFBs which means youd call rcfbballs rTheFulmerCup and other subreddits rCFBs too.

3506675,0,t3_30f8vs,So Im a little worried about work.  A couple days ago when I asked my boss if I could leave a few minutes early on Friday tomorrow due to heading out of town amp wanting to beat some of rush hour he told me no and that he was going to take me to lunch the next day.This put me in a bit of a worry since the last time he took me out to lunch ostensibly to mark my employment anniversary it turned into an extended discourse on KeriRussellBrand heres how you suck.Today I ask him a question on something and he asks me to walk with him.  We wind up going into an unused conference room whereupon a discussion ensues.  It was a Heres how you suck kind of talk.  He then informed me that he wants me to be prepared to discuss the following faults of mine tomorrow morning and how I intend to improve. Attentiveness Focus Attention to detail ProductivityIm hoping that this doesnt result in me getting walked out the door tomorrow.  If it does Ill probably spend a good chunk of the drive to Houston crying.  While it would mean I would move to Houston and be in the same city as my gf Id prefer to leave my work on my own terms.I can certainly see the first three points above.  It doesnt help that I havent gotten much sleep recently.  I also think that I might have a mild case of ADD however not only is that not something Im going to discuss with him our health insurance doesnt cover it.For the last point he specifically mentioned projects and that some others are having to share the load on my behalf.  I cant work on a project if he doesnt assign it to me.  I cant read minds.  I can barely read body language.  If he wants me to work on a project he should assign it to me.  Im perfectly happy to work on what he assigns me.  Nominally my title is security administrator.  However the tasks that Im given are almost uniformly sysadmin not secadmin.  He mentioned that hes upset Im not spending more time working on the firewall replacement project.  That he assigned to another admin.  Does he seriously expect me to sit there sidesaddle with my colleague watching him type while my other work piles up?This is the only professional IT job Ive had.  I dont have any certifications though I do have  years experience of desktop support  syssecadmin experience.Im scared of having to look for a job.  I truly am.  But it appears that I might have to look for one in the not too distant future.  I havent updated my resume in  years.  I havent had to interview or job search in  years.  I was hired in for a completely different department so Ive never gone through the job searchinterview process in the IT industry.If I am let go I do have about  or  months living expenses saved up so I wont be out in the streets right away.

There have been six different teams that won the championship in the last ten years.  Compared to seven in the NHL.  Not exactly a huge disparity.Just because this idea annoys me so much lets look a little closer.  GSSeed W v. CLESeed E  SASSeed W v. MIASeed E  MIASeed E v. SASSeed W  MIASeed E v. OKCSeed W  DALSeed W v. MIASeed E  LALSeed W v. BOSSeed E  LALSeed W v. ORLSeed E  BOSSeed E v. LALSeed WYes we have to go back to  to find a finals that had both  seeds.  Basically what history tells us is that its really good to have the best player in the world on your team in the playoffs.  Call me crazy but I like seeing the best players play in the most important games.gt Boring lack of defenseThis is so incredibly not true I dont know to even respond to it.  Golden State was great on both ends of the floor.  Thats why they were the best team.  Scoring has gone up because the pointer is more accepted and the games are paced faster than they used to be.  Defense isnt worse.  Its just different.gt Markets seem doomed for eternity ie Sacramento Minnesota etcKind of like Cleveland was until they got Lebron?

However at the time there was a limited amount of plutonium available so they had to optimize power with what they had. Plus adding more hardwareplutonium means more weight which requires more fuel to reach Pluto which adds more weight which needs more fuel etc etc...

4707887,0,t1_ctnyip0,Im not sure.  This is me totally grabbing at fleeting memories of stuff I knew before my classes this summer totally flushed my brain of anything that isnt choral lit and psych of music related so probably dont quote mecome after me too hard if this is very wrong but I believe there is a reno project in the works that will alter or move the press box in some way that would allow them to add like  more seats or something in the existing building?  I think there is another project where they are trying to add on to the building for something but I dont think thats seating related.  Also thats going to open up a new can of worms because  years ago we finally got another tailgate lot that is now frequently full and the addition plans would push the building over the top of the first tailgate lot which would mean those of us who do unreserved tailgating would again be without a lot.  But the point is Im not sure theyd look at building an entire new location to add just  seats.  The Fargodome is barely off campus used for a ton of other stuff and costshared between NDSU and the City of Fargo so Im not sure if the  involved in building far off campus would pencil out.

4988855,0,t1_cunbo6v,I know the timeline jumps but it still seems to be missing something. After the RafiRandy episode it goes back to the year prior where Kevin cant take Ruxin to the airport because he discovered his car was stolen by Rafi. But in the episode a couple episodes later Rafi is back in Chicago and acknowledges the stolen car with Kevin and tell him that he burned it. So its chronologically still a year before his death but somehow still after he gets back from California. I think the writers just bank on nothing with Rafi has to make sense. I used to think Rafi was funny but the his character gets more and more extreme to the point that it is just stupid. ,CFBOffTopic,cuncbri,2,t5_32aj8

Having been through many grueling job searches Ive probably gotten  jobinternship from throwing my resume onto forms online and  or  from friends saying my friend is hiring this are you interested?One of my friends got set up with a highpowered startup that waythey hired him based on meeting him and the friend they got connected throughthey didnt even look at his resume. ,CFBOffTopic,cvit8yg,1,t5_32aj8

But the way to check for it is... exploratory surgery and the amount of pain may not correlated with the amount of endo going on up in there. Its likely but I could have like a tiny bit and since the shot has largely worked Ive elected to not have a surgery I dont need. At least it makes people feel better about theirs haha. Gotta find the positive. But I am dreading the next few daysuntil I can get in to the doctor. ,CFBOffTopic,cvix0mp,5,t5_32aj8

5279144,0,t3_3n9ztq,Im going to add a second one for breweries outside of STLKC that I dont hate because Im being unfair to a few people.First off we have Crown Valley in Ste. Genevieve. Crown Valley is remarkable for the diversity of offerings they have. They brew beer and cider make wine and root beer and operate a BampB with a restaurant and tigers because Missouri right?. I should probably take the girlfriend here next year when I havent allocated all my vacation days towards seeing Spain. Their beer is pretty good theyve got a decent farmhouse ale the nd best chili beer in the state the nd best pumpkin ale in the state and a few others and I cant judge cider or wine as I hate those.Next up is nd Shift Brewery. These guys are in New Haven MO which is basically bumfuck nowhere. nd Shift would have a claim towards being the hop heaviest brewer in Missouri so I havent touched their offerings. The fact that they are seeking to open a location in STL soon suggests that they seem to be outgrowing their current operation so somebody must be drinking the stuff.Now we come to Columbia MO. When I was at Mizzou there was really one brewery worth speaking of and even then it was for one beer. That brewery was Flat Branch Pub amp Pizza and that beer was their Green Chili Ale. I dont think I would have graduated if not for that beers power to make a bad day not so bad and if Mizzou football is reason  why I look forward to visiting Columbia that stuff is A. Unfortunately everything else they make is kind of meh.However about a month before I graduated in  a place called Logboat Brewery opened up. Fast forward to last weekend and who should win the most GABF medals of any brewery in Missouri but Logboat. Looks like Ive got a new reason to head back.Finally theres the Springfield area. Mothers Brewing is the big name here. Their Winter Grind Coffee Stout is good but Ive had a few things from them that werent such as their pumpkin ale. Piney River is much the same way although theyve grown enough to sell their original  bbl system to STL wackos Earthbound so that they can start appearing outside of their own taproom by the end of next year.,CFBOffTopic,cvmgzo7,2,t5_32aj8

Later when she left I asked our other mutual friend what the story was with those two and I was taken on a rollercoaster of twists and turns and intrigue the moral of which was that that girl is singlehandedly responsible for roughly  of the drama in a fairly large department. So yeah that was fun. Also when I first showed up I brought a sixpack of Ruby Redbirds for myself. There was a guy there who asked me if I would be able to drink all of them because the Rubys arent as good after the first one. I said yes I can finish them. He said I dont know man Im not so sure you can do it. When I finished them after giving a stiffarm to a girl who tried to snake the last one when fortunately I just happened to be standing there to see it I tried to find that guy and hed already left.

Kibbe is made several different ways but I like ground beef mixed with spices onions pine nuts and bulgur wheat. Its pressed into a sort of ball and fried. These are not exotic dishes by any stretch of the imagination. There is a lot of crossover with Mediterranean dishes. So if you like Greek food youd probably like Middle Eastern. Im not sure where youre seeing flycovered bowls. Many cultures do not use utensils. Its not that uncommon nor dirty. Cleanliness during meals is a pretty universal belief.

If theres an IKEA nearby you can pick up some basic things than can give you some furniture until everything can be in place. Youd spend your day assembling stuff though. The national retailers may have faster delivery times  Rooms To Go Ashley Havertys  American SignatureValue City. They should be able to get you stuff delivered this weekend. Id focus on getting what you need to survive in place this weekend couch bed etc and then have the Knoxville store delivery your order minus the items you replaced or shop online and get delivery.

6395883,0,t3_439wft,Kind of. Wake was one of the schools that was tied for my top choice.When looking at schools I narrowed my choices down to   Wake Forest Miami FL Northwestern USC Cali and Penn State. Penn State was my safety school because I knew I could get in but it was too close to home for me. At first it was a race between Wake and USC for my top choice but then I got the application for USC and it was obscenely long. It was just insane how long the application was so I only filled out half of it and gave up. USC then got scratched off the list. Northwestern was a dark horse. I wasnt too serious about them until I found out how good the journalism program was and I got serious late. Unfortunately it was the last application I filled out and burnout had started to set in. I only partially filled out the application and sent it in. I still ended up  on the wait list despite that.Miami was an interesting story. I applied and was pretty interested but just didnt expect much to come of it. Then they called me and asked for permission to move me into the early application consideration pool. Then they accepted me and offered me one of their larger scholarships. This caused me to really look a lot deeper into Miami and it moved into the top of my list.Then there was Wake. Wake had been one fo the first schools to recruit me and it helped that I was also an ACC basketball fan. Wake was a front runner from the very beginning.Ultimately it came down to deciding between Wake and Miami and I choose Wake because it was a one day car ride from home instead of two days like Miami. Far enough from home but not too far.,CFBOffTopic,czgn9rc,3,t5_32aj8

I wish I had my computer and my full music library because this is totally up my alley but I cant really have everything I want in this life or else Id be way spoiled.The specific subgenres of prog that I listened to in college pretty much run on this trope.Ayreon  Universal Migrator Part  The Dream Sequencer  My House on Mars  Ayreon is a project run by Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Its a set of loosely tied concept albums where Arjen plays all the instruments and gets other prog vocalists to play parts in the songs. This album is about the last human alive after a long war. Hes all alone on Mars and enters a machine called the Dream Sequencer which shows him the memories of his previous incarnations a kid watching the moon landing Queen Elizabeth an observer of the druids building Stonehenge and more. This is the first song on the album dealing with the narrators crushing loneliness and anger as he fully comes to realize that he is the last human soul in the universe. Johan Edlund and Floor Jansen provide vocals.Muse  Explorers  Muse lives in this territory a lot too. This song deals with the fear that those in power will hoard all the resources and leave the rest of us with nothing. Interestingly enough they tend to play this up as a romantic song live despite the lyrical content.Thats all I have off the top of my head Ill add edits if I think of more.,CFBOffTopic,czsd6ac,2,t5_32aj8

Didnt play in the finals.I havent tried out only because Ive been so busy with work and studying for the CFA. I watched every night as a kid at the nightly family dinners.

If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying meme family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Maymaydae which includes things from rage comics to image macros to verticals.So your reasoning for calling a joke a meme is because random people call the funny ones memes? Lets get reaction gifs and anime in there then too.Also calling someone a memer or a narwhal baconer? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A joke is a joke and a member of the meme family. But thats not what you said. You said a joke is a meme which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the meme family memes which means youd call dub checks rage comics and other things memes too.

6759160,0,t1_d0ife64,Alright since this is getting serious and voting shows no one really agrees with what Im saying I want to actually address this.This is a decent minimalist guide to how you should be budgeting. It allows  of what youre making to personal choices.The median household income in the U.S. is . Im using the much lower median income amount because the mean income amount is  much higher than median income because of the . Assuming people are around the average which by definition they have to be a  pay cut would be roughly  cut out. If youre living by the budget above which is pretty reasonable that cuts into the  personal choice category. Using a median wage youre buying happiness or nonmisery for year out of your year discretionary budget keeping  in your discretionary budget and using the other  for your life essentials.Essentially what Im saying is use half of your personal choice category to buy happiness if it means you hate your job. And I do mean hate. Not Ahh my job is kind of crappy or in my personal case Meh Im not enjoying it. Literally cases like the way I interpreted OPs post where its consuming your life and making you miserable.I ABSOLUTELY KNOW THIS IS NOT ATTAINABLE FOR EVERYONE.Lets say youre making federal minimum wage at a fulltime job. Thats year and you wont be paying federal taxes. With a spouse in the same scenario youre doubling this to . With that pay alone no youre absolutely not going to be able to take a  pay cut legally or theoretically to find happiness. But with the median household at   reduced to  for hypothetical and lets assume month rent year  youre down to year and that is survivable. It might not be the most pleasant but what Im comparing is I fucking hate my job to We cant go out to eat because we cant afford it.TLDR What Im saying take a  salary cut if it provides you happiness is a lesseroftwoevils scenario that you should take advantage of if you need to. On top of that I absolutely acknowledge that some people cannot make this work. Single people single parents with kids especially people in massive debt etc.,CFBOffTopic,d0igce6,2,t5_32aj8

6847004,0,t3_49jvtj, years ago a graduate student at Indiana University decided she wanted ice cream. She decided to trek off campus to find the best ice cream there was. As she left campus she caught the attention of a male graduate student who was talking to his friends. He looked at his friends and said Dont wait up for me. I have to go see about a girl.And so he did.He walked up to her and asked her where she was headed and if she wanted company. Always the friendliest person among her group of friends she let him accompany her to the ice cream shop. They talked and laughed as they made their small journey. As they arrived the girl stopped talking and ordered her ice cream a nice freezing cold pistachio ice cream. The boy was enamored by the girl. He knew at that moment that was the girl of his dreams.What would you like sir? asked the ice cream man.The boy was abruptly pulled out of his little day dream and he looked to his right and saw the girl sitting at a table eating the ice cream with a spoon.Sir? he asked again.Still eyeing the girl the boy responded Uhh Ill have what shes having not paying any attention to the man behind the counter. As he walked to the cash register his eyes still on the girl he realized he had no money to pay for his pistachio ice cream. His face suddenly dropped and had a look of dejection. However the girl noticed and walked up to the cash register and payed for his ice cream. She looked at him and smiled Dont worry Ive got this. After she payed for him they both sat down at a table and continued talking...And that is how my parents met at an ice cream shop by Indiana University.,CFBOffTopic,d0sexpr,10,t5_32aj8

7323234,0,t3_4foaso,Ive been to south carolina a couple times Hilton head and Charleston. I went to Hilton Head with my mom in high school and it was alright nothing super special. Charleston I absolutely love. Ive been there twice with the bfs family. Some of his family lives there. Its so beautiful kind of like Savannah but bigger and a little more modernized I suppose. Its a very charismatic city. Lots of churches and southern houses and gardens. The food is fucking fantastic. I would be fat as hell if I lived there and could afford to eat out all the time there. We went on a food tour the first visit we were there and it was ridiculously delicious. Battery Park is beautiful as are all the old houses lining the water The Market is a fun place to pick up some little trinkets and has some history behind it. Another thing its known for is its pineapple fountainThe little island outside of Charleston Mount Pleasant maybe? is nice too thats where we stayed. Went to the Firefly Distillery which was pretty cool tried all their different types of vodka. Oldest oak tree in north america I think?Boone Hall Plantation was a nice visit. Its Alis house in the Notebook haha. The house itself is really pretty but what makes the place extra nice is the oak lined path to it. They also have the slaves quarters and then a little presentation on the gullah culture which was interesting. Some pretty gardens as well. Fourt Moultrie where Chief Osceola is buried was a worthwhile visit as well. ,CFBOffTopic,d2alntu,8,t5_32aj8

You can also fish from the beaches but it can be a bit dangerous. We had someone die earlier this year on an island of about  because he was trying to fish during a storm and he drowned after he got washed out by a big wave.

7741599,0,t3_4lc86m,So a few weeks ago one of my seniors told me that if he didnt graduate he was going to murder me because he was failing th grade Government class and the th grade US history that he was retaking. He told me that  times in no uncertain terms. Spoiler alert he didnt pass either class and as such will not be graduating.Today the parents of the seniors are supposed to come in and get their official grades and the seniors will then find out their grades also.The principal and VP at my school requested that I go home early today and lock the doors and the windows to reduce the chances of an incident if I stay late like I usually do to dick around on reddit and play games with this student.I have never really considered that I might actually get murdered. Now that it is being acknowledged by people older and wiser than me as a possibility I have to say Im really not a fan of this idea. It would genuinely ruin my summer. Feeling really good about my decision to quit and go home after this school year.Wish me luck boys and girls. Going to be an interesting last two weeks.,CFBOffTopic,d3m5weo,18,t5_32aj8

I hadnt talked to my high school friend in a good  years but I still feel bad he was a really great person. All moved into the bfs house. Its nice but also kind of weird. The only part that really sucks is that hes being weird about letting Simba out and about. If I had known this I would have found another apartment. He himself is being a little weird because hes terrified of simba knocking down shit and fucking up everything like he does but the main concern is his dad has allergies and felt them the last time he slept here. The cat wasnt even here then just all my crap. So now bf is really worried and will only let simba on the porch and in the master bedroom. I dont like it. We arent supposed to be here for too long though so it should be fine for a month or two. ,CFBOffTopic,d614ges,8,t5_32aj8

The kids age range from .I showed the kids how to do it and highlighted the key points such as how far away the feet should be where the weight should be location of the hips in relation to your shoulders etc.  Well I had them in that position for a couple seconds when the coach came up to tell me what the next activity will be and when.  I turn back to the kids and one of them pooped on the field.  You know that episode of Sunny where they are trying to figure out who pooped the bed?  It was like that.

9574719,0,t3_5c2ypi,My thoughtsIm done with the GOP for the time being. The fact that we ignored the workingclass socially conservative antitrade vote for this long really bothers me. We let it get to this level and Trump is merely a symptom of the bigger problem. Theres no more room for a moderate voter in the party.Im not worried about me. Im a straight white Protestant guy with welltodo parents. I am literally in the least oppressed class of people in this country. Im worried for all of my friends who are LGBT Muslim or a member of any racial minority. I dont think Trump is going to do anything but a lot of really shitty people are feeling empowered. A lot of my coworkers are saying some really unsettling stuff today I cant wait for them to throw that bitch in jail that sort of thing.And despite all that empowerment of crappy people most Trump voters were not bigots like a lot of my liberal college friends believe. There are plenty and the KKK endorsement altright trolls etc. dont exactly prove them wrong. But a lot of them are people who are simply fed up with what they perceive as a Washington thats ignored them. Roanoke where I live is doing pretty well economically. But you go an hour south to Martinsville where all the textile mills and furniture plants are abandoned or an hourandahalf west to Welch and Logan WV where the coal mines are shutting down and people have no idea what else they can do they feel ignored. People have been saying this all election and a lot of people are just passing them off as angry racists.Essentially Im only slightly surprised Im disappointed that it got to this and I dont know where the hell Im going to find my political home.Still we live in America.

Not being injured when its time to do all the draft stuff will. Christian McCaffrey like many studentathletes was brought to Stanford in particular to play football.John Urschel did some interesting digging into major breakdowns on the Stanford football team. Perhaps Cardale Jones said it best when he said we aint come to play school. Membership in the football team severely restricts what most players are able to major in. If Stanford is going to essentially freeze a sizable chunk of their players out of the majors that are the most useful in the nonfootball postcollegiate world in the interests of having a good football team its only fair that one of those students who has contributed the most to that football teams reputation be able to turn around and do it right back to Stanford.As much as CFB wants us to believe that this is about academics and amateurism and all of that bullshit we all know that this is no longer true.

Have you factored in the change in the amount of gas you would need traveling to an internship  days a week plus school plus your pt job?How many hours are you taking each semester and what are the classes? Are they upper level classes that are known for their difficulty?

In middle school we started around AM and then went until . It kinda sucked having to be at school the bus pretty much until dark most of the year. Afterschool activities were really rough as well. Not to say that I disagree with the science on it im sure that its better for students to wake up later but I think there are other factors that make waking up early for school good.

11779663,0,t1_dgv9byv,Thats cool Im usually up super late during the weekend anyway and that means I can get in some Dark Souls for a while. I think Im in Gold  right now and kind of stuck in a similar situation. Im pretty sure Im in division IV too. If you want we could do some competitive doubles itd be nice to have a teammate with a familiar playstyle for a bit. Competitive this season has been rough. My highest rank is plat I in s but I think Im more of a high platinum player if I could find some consistent teammates to play with. The times Ive matched against champions in unranked Ive held my own quite well. ,CFBOffTopic,dgv9gd6,2,t5_32aj8

11782482,0,t1_dgvk4xi,It totally is a dog whistle for NeoNazis to mean that but its often applied to the intents of the IMF WTO and the like.  Organizations that NeoNazis believe are controlled by Jewish folks.    Heres an article from the conservative publication The National Review that talks about globalization and globalists in terms of capitalists The funny thing about this article is that it echoes that episode of the West Wing where Toby goes to the WTO meeting to speak with the protesters.  ,CFBOffTopic,dgvkz92,8,t5_32aj8

11793073,0,t1_dgwrx9w,Yeah. I cant do FPS for the most part. Portal made me puke everywhere. Same with CoD is that the one that has a zombies level?. I cant do anything D for the most part or anything where the plane is moving. There was a Mario game I think Super Mario Galaxy where Mario didnt move but the world moved under you when you shifted in any direction and I made it approximately  minutes before throwing up. I couldnt do Sonic Pinball either but I can do Sonic on the old Sega Genesis. My vestibular system is fucked.  I play Spyro and also Pikmin and I take Bonine to play those. ,CFBOffTopic,dgws981,2,t5_32aj8
