8798641,0,t1_d75b8qc,There are definitely correct ways to say conditional sentences but even native speakers mess them up. And even if you use the wrong tense in one the listener will understand you almost every time Im talking   .And concerning tenses in general even if you use the wrong one the context will normally show what you mean.So the main thing that needs to change is your mindset. Listen to people speaking Russian with an accent and making grammar mistakes and see if you still understand what they mean. And if people in your personal life are giving you shit or making fun of you for making mistakes instead of trying their best to understand what you mean then you should be spending time with other people.,ENGLISH,d75h60m,3,t5_2qjni
