780,0,t1_ceeha8g,Actually if I remember correctly it isnt law per se its a precedent legal ruling on a trademark case. Which means that if you want to change this particular law its going to involve taking to court an actual real world case this case would require that a company fail to protect its trademark and then later try to defend  it.  Because the precedent already exists that means any company worth their weight in salt is going to try to avoid being the new test case for this particular problem.    I actually think that the problem isnt necessarily that companies have to defend their trademark in order to keep it but that there arent really very clear guide lines on when it is appropriate to act in the defense of your trademark and what kind of response you should use.  This means that some companies are going to be on the paranoid side and be overly agressive just to be safe.    If someone knows more Id love for them to chime in.,offbeat,ceeizul,29,t5_2qh11

In this case the ignition was likely turned on by a coworker and the feed rollers did most of the damage. The blades were probably jammed by the blockage he was trying to clear and were not moving otherwise he wouldnt be alive.I also give it a  probability that his coworker that turned the chipper on was high at the time one of the reasons I left that job other that not being what I wanted to do with my life was that nearly every single one of my coworkers would get high and not just on marijuana before and while working cutting down trees operating heavy equipment like trucks and chippers.

No one actually cares about the sport. Cities opt in for infrastructure. Sponsors opt in to wine dine and pamper their biggest customers.  of all seats go to corp clients its why the crowd is frequently tame during events and politicians and contractors get behind the games because theres huge capital to skim off the top.

As part of a study published last month inThe Journal of ComputerMediated Communication participants were asked to read a post on a blog.

After the days typing is done the reporter will shuffle off and set about transcribing their notes properly for inclusion in the court transcript.  Occasionally if theres missing or information or details left out etc. the reporter will refer to the audio recordings.  Thats the reason usually a written transcript includes things like unintelligible etc.Perhaps the reporter simply omitted the i hate my job parts of the transcript in when transcribing it.

713247,1,t1_cgl7uwb,gt Step recovery isnt for everyone.Beware that this is standard A.A. indoctrination. They say this only to outsiders because were rational enough to know that A.A. has a failure rate of at least  percent. We know not only that it doesnt work for everyone but that it doesnt work for most people and probably not for anyone. Now inward facing they do an about face. If youre not succeeding with A.A. then you are refusing to submit to God youre refusing to turn your willpower over to God youre still trying to think for yourself. Its just twelve simple steps. They are infallible. If you cannot follow them than then is on you. Dont let this A.A. spokes person fool you. They literally have a online groups and even a private subreddit that they use to organize responses to criticism of A.A. in social media. Heres what the United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration has to say about  stepsAlcoholics Anonymous treatment programs and other step approaches known as Twelve Step Facilitation TSF for alcohol problems are promoted worldwide. Yet experimental studies have overall failed to demonstrate their effectiveness in reducing alcohol dependence or drinking problems when compared to other programs such as cognitive behavioral therapy motivational enhancement therapy and relapse prevention.A.A. itself admits that its success rate is  percent the same rate as people who quit on their own and that its members die three times faster than those who quit on their own.  The statement that A.A. is not a religious sect is such a blatant outright lie that the United States Courts have had to intercede and unequivocally and unanimously ruled that it is religious. Courts from the st nd th th th th and th Circuits have all explicitly or implicitly ruled that this is true.The th Court of Appeals found specifically and I am quotingA straightforward reading of the twelve steps shows clearly that the steps are based on the monotheistic idea of a single God or Supreme Being. True that God might be known as Allah to some or YHWH to others or the Holy Trinity to still others but the twelve steps consistently refer to God as we understood Him. Even if we expanded the steps to include polytheistic ideals or animistic philosophies they are still fundamentally based on a religious concept of a Higher Power.A.A. members claim that the higher power can be anything. A rock a doorknob a window and so on. Lets try the  commandments of A.A. with window as the higher power and see how idiotic this claim is. . We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction that our lives had become unmanageable.. We came to believe that a window could restore us to sanity.. We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of a window as we understood the window.. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.. We admitted to a window to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.. We were entirely ready to have a window remove all these defects of character.. We humbly asked a window to remove our shortcomings.. We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.. We made direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others.. We continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.. We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with a window as we understood Him praying only for knowledge of a windows will for us and the power to carry that out.. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of those steps we tried to carry this message to addicts and to practice these principles in all our affairs.All I did was replace god with a reference to a window. Were you able to not laugh at the claim that anything can be a higher power?Again its a bait and switch. Its the propaganda they tell outsiders to whom they refer to as normys. They look down on nonmembers because only members can understand each other. The truth is that when a new member is recruited then they are assigned a sponsor who has them work the steps. Whats the first step? That youre powerless. Theyll spend weeks learning that their powerless complete with coursework. The second commandment is that only god can save them. By the time the new recruit gets to this point and if they chose window the sponsor and group will talk them out of it. This argument that the higher power isnt god has been tried in the courts and has been shot down every timeThe truth is A.A. helps no one. The force their members to admit theyre powerless and then relive all of their alcohol induced mistakes. This induces PTSD as research has shown.A.A. claims to have a success rate of  percent which is identical to that of spontaneous remission.The reason why A.A. forces its members into believing that they are powerless their first commandment is because research shows that people who want to quit do so by making the first step on their own and no outside influence has much of an effect once the decision is made.People who participate in A.A. die at a rate that is three times faster than people who seek real treatment or none at all. Thats partially because its an abstinence cult. Their members are brainwashed into believing that they cant control their addiction theyre powerless to it remember? So when they relapse they go extreme. Thats also why A.A. members are seven times more likely to binge drink. Their members are further put at risk because its very common for A.A. groups to force their members off of medication for psych illnesses like bi polar disorder because that makes them not truly sober. Its so widespread the national organization released a pamphlet that says they dont endorse the practice but stops short of condemning it or telling their groups to not do it.Additionally A.A. leads to sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of women is so rampant they have a term for it. Its called doing your th step as if rape is part of your recovery. Sometimes it even leads to murder as A.A. groups traditionally cover up the criminal history of their members. Also criminals go to A.A. frequently as part of a diversion program for domestic violence or sexual assault.A.A. and all  step programs are snake oil. They are death worshiping cults that cause lifelong and permanent harm to their members. It literally preys upon people in their lowest point and prevents them from getting the help they need.,offbeat,cglcl6d,3,t5_2qh11

Yes. The vast majority of men are cut not as infants. Did you not read what I wrote?        Even the South Koreans who adopted circumcision from Americans cut up little adolescent boys penises because they feel that an infant is not prepared for it.     The adult penis is much larger and easier to work with it is fully formed the adult can discuss with the surgeon about the kind of outcome that he wants circumcision is far from being uniform the frenulum and the frenular delta are much more developed in the adult penis etc.        Also there is good evidence that the pain of infant circumcision has a long term residual effect on the brain on the bond between mother and infant and on breastfeeding. These things do not affect adult men.        Also as circumcision is now being erroneously pushed as a way to reduce the risk of HIV its worth mentioning that the studies only apply to adult circumcisionindeed studies consistently show that infant circumcision does not seem to help my guess is that neither does adult circumcision. gt If youre going to get cut    Why are you going to have a chunk of your penis removed?

Very sweet of you to care so much that these people are healthy. But in all seriousness that you presume anyone on government aid is your culinary plaything is fascinatingly authoritarian. It doesnt even seem to occur to you if I tolerate your argument for a moment that many of those on food stamps now have paid tax for many years effectively contributing to perhaps even fully covering the cost to the government of supplying them with food stamps. So theyve already paid for them and you still believe you have a right to tell them how to spend them. Or are they suddenly exempt from your totalitarian menu?Meh. Its really not any of your business who buys what food until significant harm is being done to someone else by it. And even then there are organisations and people police social workers who deal with those violations. You pay some tax and it goes towards the cost of every public service the government provides. Im sure you can find more irritating and costly examples of waste than someone buying a steak instead of...I dont know...a gallon of gruel if thats what bothers you so much. But I dont think it really is.

If Americas issues with gun violence stemmed from the use of hunting rifles and shotguns this would be a more valid point.gt Self defence against armed police raids The reason these police raids are so OTT violent  and Im not supporting them at all I think theyre terrifying  is because they know the owners could easily have guns. In the UK the police can just knock on your door  of times because they know youre not going to come out with a rifle. In the hypothetical scenario that armed police are raiding your house do you think firing on themreturning their fire is more or less likely to end in your death? I imagine if someone starts shooting back theyre not going to back off.gt Self defence against criminalsThere are totally cases where guns have been used to foil violent crimes against the person.

To be honest I would say its incredibly absurd to block them from schools but at least its still a choice at that point. But taking it that step further and taking the choice away from people is a massive step down a very dark alley way in government corruption. To say they cant just control government controlled institutions like public school but that they can also control our home life to such an extent that they can decide at any moment to make people put chemicals we dont want into our bodies is just insane.

Minority groups are abused by majority forces but that includes both the government and ethnoregionalist its not fair to call them nationalist forces. So they have civil war and human rights abuse all over the place.But why split up into ethnic domains? There would be problems either way. Youd supernationalize the regional forces who would inevitably war over territorial control rather than government control. Bad neighbors are bad neighbors and theyve got the worst.Its because the stablenationstate idea was forced upon them when they werent ready for it. They would have probably come up with it eventually but now because the Brits forced it the stablenationstate is perceived as a Western ideal.

3220272,0,t3_2wz1cc,I wrote a response to this when someone posted it a few months ago. Heres a copypasteThe article was a clusterfuck of bad statistics. Hurricanes used to have only female names up to  when the weather service started alternating between male and female names. The authors used female name data going back to the early s but male name data only from . And found that femalenamed storms do more damage.But hurricane forecasting and satellites and TV stations and weather forecasting and modern mass evacuations didnt exist back at the turn of the century so obviously femalenamed storms would cause more fatalities because youre including storms that happened in the distant past before modern weather warnings and evacuations.If you use only data from  on when storms started having both male and female names the association disappears When this was pointed out to the authors they backtracked and waffled and said they were justified in including the pre data because they werent really comparing male and female names they were comparing the masculinity or femininity of names and you can do that with only female names. So they had an  point scale of femininity in which some female names are more feminine than others.So right away this changes their thesis of female named hurricanes kill more people than male named hurricanes to female named hurricanes that sound more female kill more people than female named hurricanes that sound less female.But that isnt all. Slate did an analysis using the authors own data. They noticed that the authors had excluded hurricanes Katrina and Audrey from the study because they were outliers  hurricanes that hit highly populated areas head on and did extreme damage. Which is perfectly fine but there was another outlier that they hadnt removed  hurricane Sandy If you remove that then suddenly the results are reversed hurricanes with more masculine names killed more people than hurricanes with more feminine names. The exact opposite of what the authors claimed.Thats not even counting the other bullshit in the paper such as. Their surveys included university students from Chicago and later random people from across the country who didnt live in hurricane areas had never been evacuated or ever had to make the decision to evacuate who had no experience of actually weighing the balance of what it takes to abandon your home or risk your life. The survey would have been much stronger if they had actually asked the coastal people who make such decisions in real life.. They didnt actually count the deaths caused by failing to evacuate because the hurricane name wasnt scary enough. They counted all deaths which include people who evacuated but died in a traffic accident in the rush to evacuate or people who evacuated but died from fallen power lines or roof collapses after they returned home when the hurricane was over. So their numbers dont even represent how scared people were of the hurricane name.. They didnt consider any other factors such as how good was the prediction. Did more people die in hurricanes which were poorly predicted like when the meteorologists got the hurricane track wrong or when they forecast lower wind velocities at landfall than actual wind velocities? They have no clue they never examined any such data.In short the only bright side to the article is that it got published and got name recognition so the authors can use it to improve their academic credentials and get more grant money.,offbeat,covs80v,8,t5_2qh11

3441857,0,t1_cpkkmyl,gt You do realize that the DA has discretion over who they charge with a crime right? They can be fully aware of a potential case and choose not to pursue it. Do you even live in America?Youve been watching too many TV dramas.  The DAs office is actually a department which depending on the jurisdiction is staffed by dozens of government prosecutors who are responsible for vetting the cases and bringing cases to trial.  There isnt a maniacal dictator who is vetoing cases based on political expediency they couldnt because theyd be reported and fired pretty quickly.  gt Are you purporting that the legal system has no bias in favor of law enforcement and that cops who commit crimes are punished as severely as any citizen? Thats a nice fantasy youre living in.The legal system has a bias against cases that it doesnt think it can win.  And often it doesnt think it can win against police officers because quite simply the laws have been written to give police officers the benefit of the doubt.There was no prosecution of the police officer in the recent high profile killings of unarmed youth in Ferguson and New York for example because the law states that police can apply deadly force if they have reason to believe their life is in danger.Thats an incredibly low bar to apply deadly force.  The fact cops are getting away with it isnt because prosecutors are procop its because the laws are procop.Youd know that if you spent any amount of time looking into the issue instead of relying on CSI and Law and Order for insights into the American justice system.,offbeat,cpklj05,-1,t5_2qh11

Theres absolutely no time for a followup scan. I suppose better procedures would include explicit but brief doublechecking of radiology records.

3949828,0,t1_cr67gtw,Im sorry I misspoke. Theres definitely a case. What I really meant was If this happened in the US you might not get a ruling in your favor as the plaintiffIf she had posted LOOK AT THIS PEDO HE TRIED TO FUCK MY KIDS!!! then yeah that falls under defamation per se because she imputed serious sexual misconduct. Im unaware of anywhere in the US where this wouldnt be a cut and dry case.But look at what she actually wrote. She doesnt accuse him of being a pedophile. She doesnt accuse him of trying to kidnap her kids. In fact the only things she said he did are take pictures and talk to the kids. So chances are as a plaintiff youd have to show damages.Futhermore the US has a defamation defense called qualified privilege under which the defense argues that the defendant had the right to make those statements. Statements that are general warnings of danger fall under qualified privilege.Now this is where the US law gets hairy. In the case of a qualified privilege defense the plaintiff must prove that the defendant acted in bad faith bad faith meaning one or more of the following depending on state.  Defendent acted intentionally Defendent acted recklessly Defendent acted with malice hatred ill will or resentment.So yeah in some places in the US you could get away with this as long as you could convince the court that you were warning others against harm or danger easy and that your intent was to not defame Since truth is a defense to defamation you could not have defamatory intent if you believed your statements to be true,offbeat,cr6iivq,2,t5_2qh11

People would often come over to our table to say how well behaved we were.  Why can people not train their kids these days?  We would have never even dreamed of throwing a fit because we knew that if we acted like shits we would get dragged out of there and taken home embarrassed and hungry.  And thats not child abuse either.  We just had boundaries and they were enforced.  My brothers kids get compliments too because he doesnt put up with shit even though hes a laid back guy.

But having a screaming kid in the lobby of a Starbucks prevents people from wanting to sit in the lobby which also prevents you from making money off of them.If Starbucks problem is losing money because their lobby is full and customers arent coming in and buying things because they cant find lobby seating how is make the lobby a place where no one wants to sit a solution? Sure there might be space now that the screaming kid has cleared out the lobby but whos going to sit there now?The Starbucks lobby is a valueadd. Its something that people know they can count on to be there so when they want to studywork and drink coffee they go to Starbucks. Starbucks willfully making their lobbies inhospitable goes against the purpose of the lobby in the first place. Finally a coffee refill at Starbucks is . or free with a gold card.

Thats a side conversation dealing specifically with the scenario he mentioned about the working condition for surgeons in hospitals and has nothing to do with this lady getting the wrong shot.  You need to follow along a little more closely or post your replies under the post you are rebutting and not in another comment thread.gtYou said because this shot got screwed up the entire clinic is not capable of delivering adequate care.No I didnt.  Show me where I said they arent capable of providing adequate care?  I said that going in for a shot and getting the wrong shot isnt adequate care for that patient.  You see its based on individual patient experience.  If youd care to enlighten me on how getting the wrong shot was adequate care for that patient Id love to hear it.  That said does it indicate the possibility of inadequate care facility wide?  Yes it does  not directly however just the potential  their next  shots may be just fine but you have to admit something in the process is broken if a wrong shot is given and they didnt catch it for  months.  That brings me back around full circle this incident shows they have the ability to provide better care always room for improvement and in the medical field being complacent with accidents happen whatever care is somewhat adequate so its all good is dangerous and doesnt do the patient any favors.  That industry should always strive for excellence.gtI was helping you with the math.My math is good thanks.gtAnd by your definition your wife does not deliver adequate care as stats show she screws up at least once a shift.What stats?gtEven if she is  better than everyone else she has screwed up before so she does not deliver adequate care.Stats?,offbeat,cu0jupv,1,t5_2qh11

On  May their house in the village was ransacked. On  July members of a village khap panchayat an unelected allmale village council  ordered that Meenakshi Kumari and her sister be raped and paraded naked with their faces blackened as punishment for the actions of their brother.This is known as Collective punishment which is when a form of retaliation whereby a suspected perpetrators family members friends acquaintances sect neighbours or entire ethnic group is targeted.  This is also a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifically Article gt No persons may be punished for an offense he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.According to Wikipediagt under the  Geneva Conventions collective punishment is a war crime.India had better get their shit together and put the kibosh on this unelected allmale village council in Baghpat.

There is no reason to exclude them neither expressly or implicitly related to the purpose of the group.Secondly I do believe golf clubs are more or less businesses. Businesses cant discriminate their customers.Third what is the purpose of your argument? To reject all discrimination altogether? Does that then mean that no one has any right to ever exclude anyone from anything? If not you do agree that a line can be drawn somewhere. Where would you propose?A group of people who consider themselves the victims of another group should not be forced to let that other group participate in their closed meetings. Thats just common sense. Whether the fear theyre feeling is warranted whether their harm is real this is about women who feel that men as a group are holding them down and want to discuss amongst themselves ways to deal with that. Do you really feel that you as a man should have the right to force yourself into that meeting whether you agree with them or not whether or not you were invited?Again think of the implications. Should a sex offender be given the right to attend a support group that might include his victims?

5197649,0,t1_cvcghje,The whole fine should be coming out of department funding where else would it come from? I still think individual police officers need more incentive than their boss might get mad. Just a week ago there was a thread on reddit saying how it is often nearly impossible to fire bad cops so they end up just pushing them to the side to answer phone calls. I think personalized fines for cops would be a far scarier scenario for them and Im not talking about all at once. They could do what the IRS does and take a piece from every paycheck. Or better yet deduct it from their pension.Anyway intent and fault is an interesting point. These guys should understand the law. Breaking the law should have punishment even for them. Willfully or unwillfully breaking the law would get a regular person in trouble. My brake light could be out and I would still receive a ticket even if I was not knowingly breaking the law. Obviously the severity of the crime matters and they should obviously receive warnings. But I think intent while its a factor should not matter that much they should know what is and is not illegal that is literally their job. In this case they arrested a guy over a facebook post saying negative things about them. Its pretty obvious in this case whoever ordered the arrest was at fault not the arresting officers. Free speech is something I would HOPE the police are aware of its arguably the most important lawrule for a democratic society.,offbeat,cvciden,3,t5_2qh11

Yes there are still a few pistols around and Im sure if you have the right contacts you can get one illegally. But you can be . sure that somebody you have an altercation with wont be armed and it also means that  of our police officers dont need to be armed either. The gun squads can be called in if theres an incident which needs them but not having them deal with routine crimes deescalates things so that most criminals dont feel the need to be armed to defend themselves against the police or each other.British police are also super polite to most people even if theyre arresting you and youre hurling abuse at them.

If you own the place you could do it every day which would count as longterm.Incidentally one theory as to why the BAT stuff works the way it does is that mammals are adapted to living through the winter. When squirrels or bears get cold for a while due to the change in seasons they can shift into a fatburning mode where they stop being hungry and get most or all of their energy for a few months from burning off previouslystored fat. Then it gets warm again and they get hungry again. The best protocols for people to do this sort of thing are still being figured out at this point.,offbeat,cwgw77a,1,t5_2qh11

The segregation of sexes especially in school is done so to limit the potential for sexually related misconduct and started in an age where the belief was that men are attracted only to women and vice versa. It was unthinkable that another individual of the same sex as you would make unwanted sexual advances in such a compromising setting but now its generally accepted socially that some people have attraction to those of the same sex.

Or the fact that the first black law clerk to a Supreme Court Judge didnt happen until   William T. Coleman.  Supreme Court clerkships are pretty much the holy grail to being a law professor nationwide.Do you truly believe there to be no correlation between these historical facts and why there were very few nonwhite male professors in my school in the late s?Or do you think that the reason why no woman had been admitted until  is that men were just more interested in law and better qualified than ALL women applicants through ?Take your pick dude.  Id love to hear your justifications for this viewpoint....,offbeat,d09i9z7,1,t5_2qh11

6716085,0,t1_d0dzhj4,gtThe rich can afford school and the poor get plenty of grants scholarships low interest loans.The children of the absolute poor get quite a bit of help especially if you are at a point where your family is on welfare and food stamps. Its the working poor who get shafted. The children of people who work two full time jobs or more but still cant help their kids one bit with education money. That is a ton of people.God help you if your parents do well but go with the  and your out the door mentality because the government assumes they will help you and if they dont you are SOL. There is no form to fill out for that. I know people who couldnt even get enough loans because their parents made a lot but wouldnt help.gt Not unless its highly regulated or something. It should be based on grades. If actually worked to prepare for school in high school and pulled nineties the entire time you are a safe bet. People like you of course would not qualify. You would still get all that free money because your parents are poor though so you would be in the same situation as now.gtor saying that the system is fucking you is weak and unproductiveI love hearing that from someone who admitted to massively benefiting from social safety nets. Your parents made so little money the state stepped in and gave you a lot of free stuff. Pell Grants low interest loans and special scholarships I believe you mentioned. Maybe you didnt get all of them but most people dont qualify. Frankly I dont understand the low interest loan thing since you pay those back after you are educated and earning well and your ability to pay  that has nothing to do with being poor growing up. I paid full interest for example I guarantee you got exactly as much help from your parents as I did zero. If you got more than zero you got more than me.,offbeat,d0e022k,1,t5_2qh11

We are already a heavy minority if you go to early age demographics like  and under or  year olds. We will be around  of the population by  or something along those lines.

Your quote simply states that if you want THC to be dissolved by fats quicker you heat it up. Which is no surprise because most things dissolve quicker when heated.

8391195,0,t1_d5qfrra,You only need emulsifiers if you want a stable emulsion. Unstable emulsions can exist for a long time. Look at simple salad dressings of vegetable oil water and sometimes vinegar. You can easily get a few hours out of one just sitting there. Then you have all turbulence of it mixing around inside the water piping and tap aerators causing more mixing. On top of that you wouldnt need enough THC that it becomes easily visible or visually clouds the water. NTU turbidity meters would still detect it though.Lecithin is a decent emulsifier I doubt it would even be looked for comes from soy comes from egg yolks. Not a health issue on its own except for people with allergies of course although strange to have in the water supply.

If you have violencephysical abuse issues that you cannot keep from patients you need to not be in a profession where people trust you to take care of them and give you their most vulnerable side. Go burn out over some financial analysis spreadsheets instead.I will say this caregiver burn outdepression for families especially poor families that cannot send their elderly away is a real thing and something that people sometimes literally cannot escape from.

It is so they can avoid being determined negligent.  The expectation is some people are going to spill coffee and some people are still going to trip over a yellow painted curb...BUT spilling coffee which is  degrees hotter than any standard coffee because the company wants to hide the terrible flavor of cheap oily beans...means WHEN not ifa spill happens the company provided a liquid mixture which melted away layers of skin...is negligent.   Now your insurance company has decided it does not want to argue in court if an unpainted curb was negligent or not...so it tell you to paint it and removes all doubt.  You will not be negligent for having a painted visible curb.  Pain in the ass for you...but people will trip regardless.     Starbucks did nothing to tamper with their product over industry standards in place anywhere at any coffee chain.  They were not negligent in any way and that is what the court determined.  People who should not drink hot coffee still will...just like they will still trip over your painted curb...but the company or you are not negligent for that.  Put it this way...even after painting your curb...should you be required to pay someone to tell every potential tripper...hay...there is a yellow curb there...please dont trip.  No...there is a point when the company has met its responsibilities and is not negligent regardless if a person is injured... and Starbucks met those.,offbeat,d9mkv1b,2,t5_2qh11

Every definiton I could find of a weapon uses phrases like an instrument used to... or device or implement. You know what all those words have in common? Theyre all synonyms of tool. Im sure many dictionaries have defined weapons as tools directly but if you cant accept the synonyms for tool being basically the same thing then youre willfully twisting reality to suit your feelings anyway and this conversation doesnt matter.gtExcept they literally didExcept they literally fucking did not. They werent explicit either way so you could assume they dont care but just because someone is talking cost vs benefit doesnt mean they like the fact that people die. The point he poses is a legitimate one How many toddler lives would be saved with even the strictest gun regulations and how much would those regulations cost society? The answers are up for debate but that was the exact question he was trying to debate. You chose instead to sidestep his very reasonable question to attack him personally assume his belief system and then attack that.gtWell maybe if vehicle ownership was limited to a fanatical subculture...You may not have a lot of experience around people who own guns but back home nearly everyone I ever knew owned at least one and the way gun owners are stereotyped is really flat out wrong. For starters very few people I know are actually members of the NRA and many hate them for various reasons. For most of the people I know maybe  gun rights arent the most important thing to them in an election stuff like the economy and medical care is some real crazy fanatics huh?. Id say about half dont give two shits about gun regulation because they know it wont affect them and they know full well that the federal government would have a very difficult time banning guns altogether so they arent afraid of that either. Despite what you might think the majority of people who own a firearm are pretty reasonable and while its more important to some than others most are smart enough to understand the pros and cons of gun regulation.These fanatics you talk about are maybe between  and  of all the gun owners I know and they give the rest of them a bad repuation. But hey its a lot easier to just lump them all together isnt it? That way if you see someone online who sounds like theyre not fully in support of every gun control proposition ever you can shit all over them and feel fully justified.gtI did ask where he thinks our time and energy can be better spent. Im still waiting for that responseYes in a snarky Im morally and intellectually superior to you tone you did. But you probably are after all that poster probably is a gun owner and therefore a fanatic like the rest of them.,offbeat,dbwnljd,0,t5_2qh11

10700446,0,t1_ddjf14w,Not verifying the story but my aunt had a stroke and she forgot all nouns. Just nouns. She still knew pronouns verbs adjectives etc. But forgot all nouns. She will say things like Bring me the... and then just start gesturing in the general direction of the object. Shell throw in adjectives such as Bring me the pretty... the gray... but she had no idea what the object she wanted was called. She could visualize it but her brain no longer can attach a noun to the visual. It left her so frustrated and helpless especially when a second stroke left her pretty much bed bound. So we created a picture page with a lot of common nouns. So if she wanted her cat she would point at the cat on the page. Now here was a weird thing. At random moments she was able to recall the first letter of the noun. So for cat she would say things like Bring me the c... c... c. But she still could not say cat despite the numerous years of therapy. And she would do this for stuff we havent told her about. So out of the blue she would say can I have my b...b....b It took us awhile but figured out she wanted to wear her bracelets. We confirmed that none of us have used the word bracelet around her. It was just retained in her memory from before the stroke. So somehow her brain could not remember the actual noun but it could randomly recall the first letter of the noun. It wasnt consistent however.From the day she had her stroke until she died  years later she was never able to say a noun.
