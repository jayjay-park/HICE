4982600,0,t3_3im4a3,There are a few thirdparty tools that allow this type of functionality but it is very hard to find tools like these that are inexpensive or free as these are typically sophisticated enterpriselevel packages handling important business data. You can look into a few tools like Dell Boomi  or Jitterbit  as Ive seen clients implement these for similar scenarios. Since staffing up with SuiteScript developers inhouse is neither a simple task nor a viable solution for most companies you can also try contacting NetSuite directly and inquiring about other Systems Integrator partners Hope that helps!,Netsuite,cuml69i,2,t5_2t7yc
