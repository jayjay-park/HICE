299015,0,t1_cfbo82y,Personally id really like to move into the hardware side of things. I find it much more relaxing to be tinkering with computers than it is to be on the software side of things. I think the most important thing is to enjoy your job though so that sounds good. At the minute im working on stuff I have no interest in so its tough to enjoy work P,RedditRustCommunity,cfbrbrv,3,t5_2zwr1
353397,0,t1_cfhe5nv,I was more thinking it would make every fight public it might push people away from coming onto our server. I know we generally have friendlies on there now but I like that when someone gets on here and griefs we need to get the whole community to try and track them down. It makes it really exciting when people have found out who has raidedkilled someone and then seek revenge. If every confrontation is made public we wont have this sort of thing happening which may take something special away from the game and our server.EDIT This is going under the assumption that it displays when people are killed in their sleep. Correct me if this isnt the case,RedditRustCommunity,cfheami,3,t5_2zwr1
