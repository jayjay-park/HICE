4683704,0,t1_ctkvnb2,You won a tournament? Or did you just only beat the scrubs in bracket. Gonna go ahead and assume you live in a weak region because high level players dont lose to Marth. ,MarthMains,ctkxdiu,-1,t5_393hr

5590355,0,t1_cwq0jqw,I wasnt trying to argue. I just thought that Marth does have some approaches. I know they are bad but its not like youre just gonna sit and wait for your opponent to run into your sword. Sometimes you have to approach and this would be how. Thats all.,MarthMains,cwq1b33,1,t5_393hr
5877086,0,t1_cxpn6ya,Read this Marth cannot adapt to changes in spacing the same way others can to him. Why? Because he doesnt have threats at multiple spacings. I am willing to go into the spacing Sheik can pressure with F tilt because she is currently threatening me with needles. But would I ever be willing to go into Marths tipper range? Nope. You cant pressure me from afar or up close. You dont need to be a computer to be aware of this weakness. You just need a brain. ,MarthMains,cxq0nmm,1,t5_393hr
6341658,0,t3_42humf,. For spacing and stuff.  Basically whenever you would just be standing around wavedash to throw off your opponent and get in a better position.. Fthrow is useful sometimes for combos especially if you can read the opponents techs.  . Not much really.  Theres only a handful of minor differences.  I dont know of any PM marths but I dont follow PM much.,MarthMains,czah59d,3,t5_393hr

6534071,0,t1_czv60oo,yeah man thats what im saying. when it works its actually extremely solid as you can setup tippers off falling upair and confirm kills near the ledge as early as . It also leads into falling nair  as you said which can lead to jab tricks.But the question is how to use it safely? is it possible perhaps when Tippered to not be punished? or perhaps off ESAMs new discovery interupting landings off whiffed upbsboost kick was used in his example will cause the opponent to go into significantly more lag  so maybe this would be the ideal setup.Its just in my experience thus far there arewere usually better punishes!,MarthMains,czv6be4,1,t5_393hr
