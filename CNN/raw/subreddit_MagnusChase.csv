And after she explained it as best she could for her own situation. I mean being kicked out by her father being beaten up by a group of people which may or may not have happened more than once and being homeless. I mean thats a pretty shitty situation being defensive as a homeless teen is natural.And heck Magnus himself was edgy and defensive as hell when he was introduced in the first book. For a few chapters really. Heck Alex has one line of dialogue being a jerk about it and after that shes far more mellow since she calmed down dont forget she had literally JUST died before that and thought her gender would be forced one way or another From then on she is less defensive unless directly insulted first. Besides the first time where she got defensive right away when magnus questioned her each other time was either being called a name being called not a girl or when sif called her it. So every other time it was understandable. I mean when someone insults you its pretty normal to not be happy about it.And subtlety has never been Uncle Ricks strong suite. Like...not once. In any of the books.but she has her own character arc her own reasons for doing things and good interactions with magnus and sam. And moving forward she can help sam get control which is pretty dang helpful.,MagnusChase,daaa59b,1,t5_33y84
