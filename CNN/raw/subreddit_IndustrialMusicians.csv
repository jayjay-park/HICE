5302914,0,t1_cvpi7d3,I was listening in my workshop. Ill give it another shot in my mixing environment. Its definitely harsh on low end speakers. Do you AB your mixes in cars or pc speakers? Stuff like that makes a great test. ,IndustrialMusicians,cvpicbn,3,t5_35yjt

6542379,0,t1_czv0065,Lol I wish I was that good at guitar but ya they are chord samples within GarageBand the solo parts are done with my fingers though  That was my goal with it starting out with normal instrumentation guitars standup basslive drums and turning it into a noise soundscape I was listening to NIN The Fragile earlier that day and the idea popped into my head ....that squealing at the end is the acoustic chords I ran through distortion and a synth peddle I have to say I surprised myself with this one and Im glad you enjoyed it ,IndustrialMusicians,czw19pv,2,t5_35yjt
7250716,0,t1_d21cu5f,Thanx for the appreciation! No samples from there were used here still the same Swarmatron instrument that Trent used to make the Social Network was used to make this stuff. Only Trent used a real hardware and we used just the soft for it Anything else we used to make these is only Spectrasonics Omnisphere.Particularly the Through Shards and Spikes track we tried to make some dissonanse using the rough sound and the bells togather it seems really cool to us. And yes we tried here to make something that could be a soundtrack to some stuff. Well it would be really great if it really was a soundtrack by us for something. Unfortunately were not famous at all and our fanbase is very small.,IndustrialMusicians,d22crwj,2,t5_35yjt
