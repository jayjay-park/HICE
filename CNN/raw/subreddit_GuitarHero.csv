5671159,0,t3_3ss1lj,There are  currencies in this game. Hero Cash HC coins and Play tokens sometimes just called Plays. HC is bought with real life money and can be exchanged for Plays at a pretty decent rate about  per  so  Play is like  cents. It can also be used to play Premium shows without having to play the prerequisite songs. Coins are earned at the end of every song you play in GHTV mode. They can be exchanged for Plays player cards note highways guitar upgrades and hero power packs. So if you dont buy a lot of the extras you can just use your coins to buy your Plays.Playing  GHTV song on demand costs  Play token. You also earn Plays when you level up for the first  levels or so and get  free Plays when you finish the GHTV tutorial. It may sound like a money grab but it actually works quite well for some people. I was apprehensive at first too about not being able to own my favorite songs but I kind of realized once I practiced enough in GHTV to hit expert I didnt need to repeatedly practice my favorites over and over to be satisfied. I dont feel the urge to play all my favorites every single day. Usually its just when my friends come over or I have the craving which is once or twice a week.So instead of spending  on  songs I can get like  Plays from that instead which lasts me like at least . months and Im not restricted to playing only  songs because I can use the Plays on whatever song I want.,GuitarHero,cx02ai6,4,t5_2rgub

6258489,0,t1_cz0q4xh,Thanks! The new update looks pretty cool! I have a few suggestions though. The new UI is kinda confusing. I dont think the clock and the information icons are necessary I think just tapping the trackblockicon is sufficient to bring up the info popup. The Open YouTube part in the Song catalog is pretty unintuitive. I think an icon might be a good idea there and just have a close button on the info popup. A close button might also be useful in the info popup for blocks. If possible the info popup on the songs could also include which blocks that song is featured. Possibly the next time that block plays too. The favorite blocks sectionpush notification could also include which channel it would play next on. Whichever page I go to the top bar says Upcoming No favourites set even if I do have favourites set or Im not in the schedules page.Thanks again for making the app!

7049620,0,t1_d1f5abk,If your opponent is playing on the same difficulty which is really the only time hero powers are a necessity just watch the other persons lane while youre using x  score chaser. Much easier as you can see where all the HOPOs are while still benefiting from your hero power. Only pain in the ass time is when they use it at the same time as you. Perfect for solos though as people rarely use it because of this issue and you can benefit massively from it. Ive won a couple of close games because of this,GuitarHero,d1ffktg,1,t5_2rgub

8664174,0,t3_4yivdg,If you only want to play guitar and dont want to buy songs then I recommend GHL. New button layout makes it fresh and more interesting while playing slower songs. Additionaly youve got  songs to play in GHTV for free you earn coins which you spend on plays dont worry not much grinding. Yes of course it might be shut down in the future but I think then it would be DLC to pay for just like Rock Band.,GuitarHero,d6on1uu,2,t5_2rgub

9180694,0,t1_d8fpdjx,gt d the game before. I think party pass isPremium shows are where you get to play songs before they get released to the on demand setlist.But st you have to play the songs required to unlock the show.which you can do buy playing on the channels or using a play for them.Player cards are icons you can pick or buy for you i dont buy playing cards so im likely missing information.Highways is the note board you have in GHL career mode you will get to play with different highways but on GHTV on ios you have the same highway.But not sure if it is the tap version only that does not let you do this stuff.Anyway i hope i did the best to tell you this but likely someone could do a better job.,GuitarHero,d8fpxva,1,t5_2rgub

Possibly but in the future you could definitely hold out for a Guitar Hero collector who would be interested in it. If you wanted to use it you could get a dongle for whatever system you own and connect the gold guitar to it.
