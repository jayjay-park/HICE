With Robbies car able to teleport go through buildings and he can surf the Hellcharger and use his whip chains I think they would love to play with developing those mechanics.Plus so many Marvel games are going to end up as New York it would be good to see LA which outside GTAs parody isnt big in games like New York.,MarvelVGU,dfmwv5l,1,t5_3f3o3
