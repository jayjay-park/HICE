Now that he has access to gods and other universes it was only a matter of time before something like this happened. TFS has actually made Kakorrot more like how AT wanted than the anime did.

11099180,0,t3_5yfilz,Split into DUMPLIN shaped forms you say...?To be honest Ive always been more interested about Majin Buus past specifically when or where he was created never really thought about his future in the series. Him having a family is a neat little concept. Personally Im wondering if Uub will be part of this family at all. Would he be something like an uncle to the little Buus?

11153872,0,t1_devt1im,Not really. As I said its all about preferences. Im a big Vegeta fan so I incline towards Z just by it. Not to mention I was never fond of the raunchy comedy the original DB had. Great battles and sagas with Piccolo Daimao and the Tenkaichi  but I much prefer the seriousness and fights of SaiyanFreeza saga and the Cell one. ,TeamFourStar,dewa2td,3,t5_2va15

11504113,0,t1_dfzwert,Basically you have two very different copy write systems clashing. According to Toei TFS is stealing their work and getting paid for it. Be it indirectly though patreon.The USA how ever has a fair right law that allows people to use copyrighted material as long as it is intended as a parody and not just reusing character.  AKA how Weird Al operates though he still asks for permission to use songs even though he doesnt need to.And Youtube simply has a shitty review system that auto defaults the copywrite bots as being correct. Requiring human review to undo it.  ,TeamFourStar,dfzzpgy,45,t5_2va15

11532609,0,t1_dg328qs,You can sue for anything.I think Toei could sue TFS and win. Dont know what the scope of the damages would be the character of the Patreon income would be important I think but statutory damages are high and designed to break corporate bootleggers not private persons.All that said it would unusual for Toei to do this. Japanese copyright law is not different from US copyright law in any way that matters I dont think and although US copyright law would probably control in this case Toei itself still has cultural preconceptions about acceptable infringement  namely they operate in an industry where doujinshi is often encouraged and DBZA kinda looks like doujinshi. Toei has the standing to sue and win but may be choosing not to do so because it would damage their reputation in Japan. However DBZA is a direct infringement of DBZ it also arguably provides a doujinshiesque space for voice actors and writers. DBZA just takes more from its source material than traditional manga doujinshi. DBZA is extremely derivative but also very creative and there is some respect in Japan for creative endeavor which may put DBZA somewhere below outright piracy but above homage.,TeamFourStar,dg381vz,2,t5_2va15
