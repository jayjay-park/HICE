5380033,0,t1_cvyoj2t,The sub is irrelevant now. If it had a different name would that make you happy? I think its kind of silly the creator started a new December event sub but hey thats his deal. Ill still follow it to see if anything interesting shows up.Id be all for a sub chronicling the possibility of an earth changing event in the next year or so. I dont see the point in trying to predict a date though. ,Sep2015Event,cvzcyl4,1,t5_387xs
