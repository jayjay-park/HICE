6145863,0,t3_3zqhn2,XYZ support is a joke. It took me two weeks of bullshit before I decided I was done and wanted to flash the firmware. My tipping point was exactly what happened to you my XYZ branded cartridge jammed and almost caused irreparable damage to the printer.,davinci3d,cyo7xhz,2,t5_34nbc
6989988,0,t3_4b1nid,Um... so I just fixed my tensioner on my Pro and fired up XYZWare Pro. I loaded up a gcode model to do the cuboid temp test and sent it to the printer.It was only after my .a lit up and beeped that I noticed I had set the Pro software to connect to the wrong port and it just sent the gcode model to my .a. No error thrown or anything by the printer. It heated up and started away.While it was starting I changed the port the software was using and sent the same model to my Pro. Both are buzzing away now. Im curious to see if the .a does the temp changes like the Pro. The . is using XYZ filament in a cartridge and the Pro is running some Hatchbox.Well see!,davinci3d,d18nntp,1,t5_34nbc
