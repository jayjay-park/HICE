950057,0,t3_24zgdu,Lol I understand his reason  but on the other side he must also understand that you cant change the past. Any reference to still living victims is hurtful and racism will always be here as long as we live in a controlling society  let m speak to elders who have seen the effects of the words first hand.  Im sure he will change it back in no time.  Comic relief does not apply with serieus issues.  The problem still exist.  Even if you try to flipmanipulate the meaning of a word. Edit best example Richard Prior. One trip to afrika changed his mindset. He said I didnt see any niggers in Afrika. And took that word out of his vocabulary. That also shows how deluded the mainstream American mindset on black people is..,blackpower,chca2e3,1,t5_2r60t
1833774,0,t3_2fkrin,If you just read the first few paragraphs and stop I encourage you to keep going. You can do this! Read until the end. Its worth it. It makes sense. Super infuriating and I dont know the answer but... It makes sense. Only answer I have Consolidation. Pure and simple. There is no need for all these little townships and villages and city halls.

4296090,0,t1_cs95ohn,I think what people are failing to take into account is that we Black Americans were taken from independent nations and forced into a multigenerational system of dependency that neither allows us to be fully citizens of the United States nor fully free of it. Until we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as a free and independent people integration doesnt make sense. It will always be a hierarchy with us on the lower rungs.,blackpower,cs9w4c1,1,t5_2r60t
