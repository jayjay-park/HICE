The concrete bridge will only lead you to the back of orange stage which is only accessible by volunteers of a specific rank. But as a regular sleeping in J and volunteer camp its not that long a walk really. Also B is a very nice area in general due to the remote tent area and still being close to so many facilities like the showers and good food area  sports area where there usually are lots of people to meet and greet. ,roskildefestival,d3fkrl8,3,t5_2t5ur
