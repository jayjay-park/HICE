5119177,0,t3_3l3tt6,This movie is so wicked. Besides the obvious fact that this movie has a prequel called Django Unchained it also has an ear cutting scene mildly similar to the one in reservoir dogs. This movie was clearly a big influence on Quentin Tarantino.,CultCinema,cv31wr9,2,t5_2rajq

5413052,0,t1_cw3ihss,Thanks so much!! My boyfriend Scary Harry and I Anna Chovie have wanted to make this mix for awhile after being inspired by the Skeleton Farms Halloween Horror Show. Scary Harry actually hosts the original Halloween horror show on the same Vimeo account with permission from brianunfried the creator and he is behind forbidden transmission! Really glad you like it  ,CultCinema,cw3krlq,1,t5_2rajq

9343542,0,t3_58d6uz,Ive got the Intervision DVD and I can honestly say its the worst movie Ive ever seen in terms of the competency of the creators.  Its worst than Manos but thats the appeal.  You can tell the movie was made  earnestly by a couple of Canadians who had no idea what theyre doing. Two other great ShotOnVideo SOV Intervision releases are Nostril Picker and Sledgehammer.  Both are fabulously entertaining but not as lowgrade as Things.  The closest movie I could compare Things to is Black Devil Doll from Hell.,CultCinema,d90czyk,2,t5_2rajq
