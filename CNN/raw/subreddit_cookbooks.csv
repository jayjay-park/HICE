5928948,0,t3_3wk04w,Id recommend picking up any cookbook written by Sara Foster. She started Fosters market which now has  locations in the Durham Chapel Hill area and her cookbooks are great. Since you said your mom lives in the south she may appreciate the familiar ingredients and recipes found in her books though they arent strictly southern cooking manuals. They focus on fresh ingredients layering simple flavors making things quickly for dinner building a pantry and cooking well from it and one of the things she does in her books that I love is that she will give a base recipe and then offer  suggestions of how to tweak it a little bit to make it different. The food usually ranges from super simple fried egg sandwich to a little more upscale pan seared duck breast with wine and cranberries so a beginner cook and a more experiences one will both feel at ease. Seriously I cant recommend these enough and you can even pick them up cheaply used on Amazon. My favorites are fresh every day the fosters market cookbook and Sara fosters casual cooking. ,cookbooks,cxwte8u,3,t5_2sbsf
