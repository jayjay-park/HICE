The money will remain on your ONEcard until you close your ONEcard account. You can only do this once you are completely finished with the U of A that means you are no longer a student or staff and you dont have an alumnus card. There is also a  fee for closing your account this rule has been added recently to deter people from closing their accounts prematurely.

Another thing to consider even if the economy does get better there are grads from this year last year and there will be more in the following years who are still looking for jobs. I myself am not in engineering but a handful of my coworkers are engineering and theyre not employed as engineers. They work at Costco with me. One of them in particular graduated his Chem E with coop experience last summer June  and he is struggling to find any work and even was looking at overseas options but sees little hope in getting anything anytime soon. If youre in the position to afford more years of tuition and are truly passionate sure you can stick with it. But in terms of being employed soon after graduation... Really reconsider. I know way too many friends who graduate with a degree and its not related to their current employment or they end up going to NAIT.

6858865,0,t1_d0tirsz,It wasnt easy but it definitely was fair. Saying that the exam was stupid or that it screwed you over simply because it didnt test on what you studied knew best or because it was not similar to the practice exam especially when it clearly states that it doesnt reflect actual exam questions is silly. After every lecture I tend to spend one or two additional hours reviewing the notes. Final review of all the lectures covered on the midterm took approximately  hours. Hours though are subjective and a terrible metric and meaningless when it comes to studying. Personally I find rote review a waste of time. Studying should be focused on YOU being able to synthesize and explain the material as if teaching it to someone else not regurgitating without any thought weight or meaning behind what youre regurgitating. Im mostly a visual learner so the lecture notes itself with pictures and diagrams are more than enough for me to study off from. I cover up the labels and label it myself or if that isnt enough I do rough sketches on scrap paper. Constantly test yourself... well what would happen if this or that was damaged?

If you dont have that many credits that are transferable and have less than  credits at the university check out the fresh start program. Basically same thing as above but you get enrolled in the university in open studies.

There are some cases where maybe seeing a foreign name on the job application might turn someone away but I think if you have the qualifications they are looking for and do a really good interview theyll hire you regardless. Maybe your resume is just subpar? You could try going to the career center at the university and have them look over your resume. I would also recommend writing cover letters for your job applications. Yeah the point of most international students coming here is that its considered better in their home countries to have an education from an English university overseas.

Also Im currently doing a double major in math and stats and as for electives most of them are arts options. Most of the freedom for science options is kind of thrown out the window when u do a double major not to mention those programs have pre reqs in other departments. I know many comp sci classes need math  some need  stats classes and some need math . Electives in stats take a decent amount of prereqs other then applied stats for example stats  the coreq is math  which is essentially  math classes.  Not to mention that biochem has prereqs as well I believe in Chem not to sure about this one.Your also going to want take physics classes for the MCAT and I havent heard of a degree where English classes arnt mandatory.

9485557,0,t3_5apqkd,Time management is the most valuable skill Ive learned. If you want to do well in  or so classes at the same time you should probably make some sort of schedule to keep you on track. Start assignments and exam studying early so you can clear up problems as soon as they arise. At the start of each semester make a  month chart with every important due date and test date for the next four months Ive found this really helps put things into perspective.Another part of this is learning how to best use your time. If you are a hands on learner maybe studying by reading a book isnt the best idea. Find out the learning method that is best for you and use that. I personally dont even take notes anymore I find I never come back to then so its a more effective use of my time to pay full attention in class it varies from class to class though.Also use resources Khan academy patrickjmt and mit ocw if you need extra explanation.

Instead there is considerable use of computer software and learning how to navigate the inputs and outputs. Also a lot more theory and less practice than most pure math since you learn about stuff that isnt directly related to calculations like sampling biases methods of reviewing data etc.Math  is a more traditional type of pure math.

Most of the instructors were retarded but a plus in the arts is that means youre overqualified so it wasnt such an issue.Currently Im in the faculty of science pursuing a Compsci major and to try and gtfo of here a history minor. The classes have been poorly conducted and often had issues like impossible literally questions on major exams. Instructors often have a heavy accent and seem to not understand conjuctions and very few have any sense of how to teach.Take as an example Amaral who is probably among the few decent profs in this cesspit. Regularly wins teaching awards but tbh for what I would consider common sense and a bare acceptable minimum for a decent institution.Staff have always treated me with scowls and a youre wasting my time attitude when I have to ask questions due to our incomprehensibly poorly organized website. Then theres the annual beartracks DDOS which has screwed me out of classes on one than more occassion.Im done. Im tired and I want to go home but I fucking cant because of how entwined I am now.My advice should you still intend to go The uni is not your friend. Always assume bad faith in dealings with anyone there and know that no question gets answered that isnt asked.Ill be honest the people on this sub have no tolerance for hard words but I cannot see how my experience has been so incredibly deviant from theirs.

Even when we got into the harder topics it still felt pretty doable because of the number of topics I had covered priorOf course Im not saying this is the main reason why BC students might be shown to fail more than AB students but I think high school education plays a huge part in itBut whether my appreciation for calculus is due to the high school curriculum or my potential integral fetish remains to be seen,uAlberta,dgpvg3n,12,t5_2spif

11772248,0,t1_dgue39p,Thanks for the response it was actually quite helpful  One thing that I forgot to clarify and will actually edit into the post is that I am not looking into any easy courses but rather interesting ones. SOC just kinda fits due to its mix of every arts course I liked in school  psychology econ and human geo. I really love literature and CS a weird mix but I dont think this would help much.,uAlberta,dguf09k,1,t5_2spif
