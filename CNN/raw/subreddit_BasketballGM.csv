1129356,0,t1_chwmuun,gt League Award calculations are calculated once and then stored on the players profile right?Yes.gt If so one solution would be to merge all player IDs in the EWA table before sorting. So if a player that was traded midseason appears on two teams his ID remains the same merge the few traders hand out awards and forgot about it until next season?Yes basically. I would implement it as an option in player.filter so it could be used elsewhere since there are a few other areas that would similarly benefit.,BasketballGM,chwnue7,1,t5_2x4dq

If you can extend that area then Im wondering if you can stretch it all the way to  years.

That is a vestige from when it used to be literally impossible to go over the roster limit at any point in the regular season. Now it just shows that error when you try to play a game since trades can bring you over the roster limit at any time. So there is no need to show the same error when transitioning to the regular season which is what happens when you start a new league itll just show up when you try to play.

2542093,0,t1_cmq7f90,Somethings of note you should see the point differential on the that team I have run across a few teams that had a really good point differential or defensive rank to the league but their standings didnt show it. Once the playoffs started they would go on to beat better seeded teams that were inferior to them in those aspects.  You only seem to have one defensive back up big. This can hurt if you find yourself with that other big being the lone defensive stopper. It also hurts you offensively if you find yourself with an all guard line up with no Post player.Except for two main rotation players the rest of your main rotation players are old to really old and this can hurt defensively.  The only good defensive players that are old are bigs who rely the least on athleticism but more on height while guards become unreliable.The other possible explanation could be that it was just a bad match up for some of your key players.  I have had the case where my best player gets into foul trouble or that the other team has really good defensive wings and kill my offense since I dont  have strong or fast enough BPassers.,BasketballGM,cmqdzzf,3,t5_2x4dq

10945526,0,t3_5wcb40,LOL the game has that built in where on random a player will just die and leave the justification in red at the bottom corner of the screen. Adjusting playing time wont affect the chance of death of a player it is just on random.Example I was trying to rebuild the Orlando Magic and this occurred. ,BasketballGM,de8ycdu,13,t5_2x4dq

11604503,0,t1_dgatosh,Same. Cleveland Curses. Winningnest team. Most finals appearances wins and losses. Unlike the real Cleveland Cavs. Rarely get an mvp though because I never tank. I have a spurs like system currently. I used to tank  seasons then wreck faces but thats a cheap tactic.,BasketballGM,dgbdot4,3,t5_2x4dq
