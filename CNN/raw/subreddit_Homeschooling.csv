9080452,0,t1_d82tdwd,Those are some really good questions!I was not unschooled. My mother used Saxon Math IEW for Englishwriting skills Apologia for sciences and another curriculum for combined Historysocial studies and reading though I dont recall the name. However my family was too big for her to really keep up with everybodys grades and help everyone who was struggling I have  siblings all homeschooled so there was a lot of educational neglect followed by periods of intense cramming and that made school a very negative experience for me.I didnt really connect with other teens very much at all though we were involved in our church and participated in sports programs for a private Christian school I never really felt like I got religion and that was a thick barrier between myself and teens that I was allowed to see regularly. Outside of those two opportunities I did not have any other opportunities to connect with other teens. I played a lot of Runescape and sort of connected with some other players but that was pretty much limited to the context of the game. When I got a drivers license I got myself a job at a pizza shop and my coworkers were my first experience interacting in a social group that my mother had not handpicked for me. It made me feel like much less of a freak to work with other nonreligious people and I think that is when I finally started feeling more comfortable with who I am as a person but it was years before I managed to convince myself I wasnt literally going to hell for not understanding my mothers religion. The extreme shelteredness of my upbringing ended up doing a real number on my selfesteem because I didnt feel like I fit in with anybody I had ever met so I must be a freak right? It took a lot of therapy as an adult to overcome that.My magic wand would be public school. I know I wouldve done just fine and the control my mother exerted over my life even after I went to college refusing to do her part of the paperwork to get me financial aid using it as a bargaining chip etc really damaged my social skills and limited my opportunities as an adult.,Homeschooling,d83bmvl,1,t5_2sybr
