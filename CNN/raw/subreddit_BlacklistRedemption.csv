11125955,0,t1_det3om5,My assumption is that they are meant to get away after the terrorist act. Then authorities are meant to track them back to the original people where they find the dead bodies suicide noteconfession and evidence on their computer of planing and executing the act someone mentioned something of chat history. Which puts the blame on Americans and not the Russians. My problem with this is why go thur all the rigmarole of surgery and tattoo for short term missions when your agents already look slightly like their marks. If anything this makes getting away harder. Since you know you now look like the people who you want the police to think committed the acts.You already looks like the people at a passing glance so wear hats and long sleeves to hide tattoos or lack there of and then leave bread crumbs to lead them back to the dead bodies and let the police assume they have the right people and disappear.OR Get all the surgerytattoo and Kill the originals and dispose of their bodies and then go on your kamikaze mission and let police assume you are the americans. But you dont do both. ,BlacklistRedemption,det48rl,7,t5_3elxl
