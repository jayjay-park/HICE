They also make a similar rig that floats commonly called a bluefish rig You will want a few weights between  amp  oz. Triangle or something other than egg shaped will work best. The most common thing you will catch are blues. Next will be rays or skate. Walk out into the surf a bit then fling your bait out as far as you can. Blues come in runs a lot down there at that time of year. Cut mullet and squid are the main bait. Ive never fished off of a pier down there. You will want to take another smaller heavy bass like rod and reel as well. Spanish like metal think spoons. You reel them in fast. ,SurfFishing,ch5avb5,1,t5_2v1ik

10771505,0,t3_5u328u,A ft trout rod seems a bit light for surf fishing although I guess it depends on what your fishing for. With that being said options for quality surf gear rod and reel are limited for the  price range. I purchased with a budget and got a ft Offshore Angler Power stick bass pro brand for  and bought a Penn spinnfisher ssv for  and  worth of braided lb test line. I love the setup but it would be considered somewhat middle of the road compared to other equipment. Actually I wish the real was a tad lighter.  But you could get a rig a bit cheaper and upgrade in a couple years. Maybe look at the Penn prevail rod and a Penn fierce. Not the greatest reel but your looking at about  for the pair. Dont go with one of the Penn combos the rods are junk and will most likely snap. Someone else might chime in with a better reel suggestion.,SurfFishing,ddr0201,1,t5_2v1ik
