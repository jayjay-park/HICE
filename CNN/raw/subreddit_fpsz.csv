1714774,0,t1_cjs20vd,It benefits new and unskilled players by giving them a  hit kill class that the enemy cannot see. When their options are go an entire game in many other classes without ever making a kill or wait around some random corner and knife some shmuck they like it. Even if they only get  kills a round for them it feels better than zero kills per round. TF has done a decent job of making it so the spy is not completely over powered. On the other hands the infiltrator in TA is just plain broken. Also keep in mind the term noob is relative. For instance I have played level  noobs in TA who fall back to turrets  infiltrators as soon as they realize they have no chance of killing you in a strait or even slightly unfair fight. For them even if it does nothing or even hurts the teams chances of winning just getting that  trap kill on you is worth it. Its what keeps them playing. ,fpsz,cjvb5au,1,t5_2y750

Either way I wasnt really a fan of the TV discgldiscgldiscgl juggle. Whats the current outset for passive reload a la TV or TA?Then again explosive AOE diarreha has always been par for for course in tt it just took the form of offhand minesampnades speaking of were there any minesnades or plans for any offhand weapons at all?,fpsz,ck6647m,2,t5_2y750
