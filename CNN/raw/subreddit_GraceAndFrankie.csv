7277382,0,t1_d0wydnr,I initially skipped over it because I wasnt interested in all the main character being super old I though it would be too unrelatable or pandering to the older crowd. Im glad I decided to give it a shot because it has become my favourite comedy currently airing.,GraceAndFrankie,d25e1hs,4,t5_310nj

11337645,0,t3_61f8q7,SO in the episode where Frankie is in the hospital the joke is that Sol cant find her in the system so he starts seeing if she maybe used a different persona. But at the end of the episode when the kids forget to tell him that Frankie got back home hes still at the hospital looking for her.... wouldnt she be in the system by now? She was looked at by a doctor and had tests done?,GraceAndFrankie,dfh3p1z,4,t5_310nj
