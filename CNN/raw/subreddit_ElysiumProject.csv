10014504,0,t3_5j1u5z,I figure it will be adjusted once they come back from break. So this is kind of like another stress test. Hopefully they will adjust it when the fresh realm comes out.It shouldnt be that hard to add progressive spawning on items if they figured out how to do it with npcs. I reckon the fresh start will be more packed but except for the server issues the spawns should be fixed and the database errors shouldnt happen again or the super long  hour read sick debuff.If those things do happen again shame.

Mining and skinning or herbs and skinning will be good profit and skins while cheap will be a good source of income.  You also need to kill mobs to skin them which gets you xp in the process.  Two birds one stone.  Just make sure you have huge bags when you get to Shimmering Flats and STV.  ,ElysiumProject,dbe4dum,3,t5_3hi6u

10223633,0,t3_5mdhgl,I think pm GMT  is pm EST.I will be doing it alone.  My plan is to roll a Troll Mage run to Ratchet The Crossroads Camp Turajo and make my way into Red Cloud Mesa the Tauren Starting Area.  It takes about  minutes to do the entire run. This lets me get some flightpoints early and move to a starting zone that will be the least populated and most spread out.  The Tauren starting zone has mobs that spawn in the hills away from other quest objectives so there will be little competition from most of the novice players that will stand around for  minutes waiting for one mob to spawn.  I plan on being around level  by the time Im done with the Tauren Area and then fly straight to Org since you start with that FP already and take the zeppelin to UC walk to Silverpine and quest there.  A lot of people came up with elaborate plans to walk around and only level off of fetch quests and discovery xp but its not even close to worth it.  Discovery xp is  to  per thing discovered.  Killing a level  mob at level  gives you  xp.  The benefit you get from running somewhere is entirely negated by killing one or two mobs.  I will not be grouping up with any random players except for single named mob quests.  Kill XP is severely diminished and I can tag mobs on my own no problem without anyone elses help.,ElysiumProject,dc2wmll,5,t5_3hi6u

The wait for it is slow because the spawn rate on the mobs in moonbrook is bananas so the traitor has to fight basically an endless wave of mobs. This causes people to stack up where you get the quest because only  group can go at a time so its a cluster fuck competition of whos group can accept the quest the fastest. Then theres a bug where sometimes even after you manage to corral the traitor into the building you dont get credit though supposedly running into DM afterwards fixes this?. I have no idea what the backend code for this looks like but if making a quest raidable was possible thats the fix I would apply. ,ElysiumProject,dc8u5rl,1,t5_3hi6u

10364167,0,t3_5oarbo,I keep making myself go broke because every time I see say a level  player struggling to fight something only  levels above them I look at their gear and I see its still level  white and greens with MAYBE like the quest reward from Deadmines or something. I have to stop what Im doing and let them know the powers of the Auction House.I let them know that it is perfectly OKAY to stop grinding the levels for just a moment to focus on skilling a trade up and farming some currency for a few upgrades. The power of having up to date gear and weapons...But then there are those times where I quest alongside someone and I really feel theyre a cool person who just does not have the time to go farm for a few hours to get some nice loot in their bag so I take them to the AH and I buy them a handful of pieces. You dont know how many times I dont even have the coin for my own skills so I stop twice as often to grind coin just to learn my abilities hahaha.My name on the pvp server is PocketPicker. I will always try to look out for my fellows who are leveling. I know what it is like to be unsure of what to do or where to find gear and I also know how good it feels to go buy  or  or  nice things close to your level with ideal stats and to go back out and continue questing and you stomp  mobs with ease as opposed to that struggle against only one. I want everyone to know what it feels like to keep their gear up to date and their character respected and strong.Because......This is a PVP server and when you get to the s and your gear is outdated you are going to get hammered. Sure theres not much you can do against a bunch of bored s in STV or Arathi or where ever HOWEVER keep in mind players on the other faction are just as undergeared as you. Take the opportunity to get good gear and you can contribute considerably to the world pvp effort and survive in the process.Im only a  rogue and I can take on players more than  levels above me who do not take the time to get gear but still come harass low level players. I want everyone to know this feeling  And I will continue to pause what I am doing to help everyone out in that leveling experience that can easily become a nightmare when you can barely do your own quests.lt this community.Stay Geared Stay Strong.I implore everyone to try and help at least one person every day with more than merely teaming up. Share the wealth and throw em a potion and a spare green youre only going to vendor.As for those who buff us when they pass thank you. I always love and appreciate that minute and minute assistance. Those buffs go a long way for us randoms. When I was a druid on live from a  twink that owned STV prebc and a decked out feralhealer in bc and wrath I always went out of my way to buff heal or help randoms get gear. I mean being in rocking ulduar loot I was able to pretty much do man heroic dungeons with  people and no main healer... it was broken being druid in wrath but it was so fun helping people.Keep it up. All of those lowbies in goldshire love you for the  stam. And even getting Might from a Paladin my rogue flies through fights like  seconds faster. You can feel the difference at those levels. Its awesome.,ElysiumProject,dciu925,4,t5_3hi6u

Heres a summary of the term StrawmanA straw man is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater intentionally misrepresents their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak amp fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument. Intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of  avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or  making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders.Unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance. While their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least excused of malice.,ElysiumProject,dcltt7b,-1,t5_3hi6u

10412536,0,t1_dco750u,Well tbh in RBG like gameplay the horde HAS to push. The longer the fights lasts the greater thr advantage of the alliance. Paladins are way better in sustained healing than shamans. If the fight drags out the shaman runs oom and paladin with his heals and BoF reign supreme and shred horde to pieces. So end the fight early to lose to alliance. Furthermore the biggest advantage of shamans over paladins is the severe burst. Once the burst is on its mins cooldown shaman lose much of its firepower and are alot less useful than paladins who keep their BoF on a sec CD and all his viability is on short cooldown overall yes bubble is on min CD but its not used as regularly as shaman burst,ElysiumProject,dcobuaa,5,t5_3hi6u

Ofc the guilds who are going for server firsts like clearing MC Ony BWL cant slack but its not that much of an issue.

10625286,0,t1_ddbgfbu,I got  slot Runecloth bags for .g at around lvl   Wish I would have done this sooner.  Less time leaving the area more time grinding and getting lootxp.  Bear livers or whatever  from lvl bears sell for enough that if you grind them to  youll easily have enough.  Plus you can resell them.Turtles are a pretty damn good gold mine for grinding on also if its not a weekend and odd hours.  Seems like  am CSTNA is bigger down time for the server k ppl or so.  And youll always have turtle meat too..I skin and sell to vendor.  I sell almost everything to vendor besides greens and higher with decent stats.  Mail everything to bank alt if you can.  Maybe Im looking at it incorrectly but the way I view it is the same as PoE or BDO grinding  dont take it if its not worth the time.  In PoE theres a generalTSOchicken guy that talks about maximizing your time grinding  its a good watch regardless of the game.  In BDO Blade Boques talks about micromillions and maximizing your profit streams.  If I were to take a g green item it takes a slot.  In place of that I could have a stack of greys that vendor for sg.  That green item needs to be ran back at one point mailed to alt alt logged into and resold.  If Its not worth enough drop or vendor it.  Thats my view..Im sure others will disagree or have their own ideas.,ElysiumProject,ddbx11i,1,t5_3hi6u

Unless you want to be raiding hardcore or PvP in premade battlegrounds you pretty much can do whatever you want.For fun I leveled with Arcane mage spec with arcane spell damage items which is the least effective mage spec some people say its so bad that it doesnt even exist never was I kicked from a group or told that I suck at the game. I had some conversations with people who were curious why would I put my self in such disadvantage but even those conversations were in a friendly manner.Sure there are some asshole in this game aswell but most guys are pretty cool.Dont try anything like the arcane mage until you get better.

Id like to imagine it used to be so much more but most likely it was just easy to spawn shit and film it in there. Menethil Bay with dense fog and gloomy look. Could have been part of a legacy weather system that never made it into the finished game. Slightly more likely that this was the old set thematic for Menethil or Wetlands entirely. Booty Bay looks heavily revised compared to finished game. Boat docked in the harbor  most likely a nontransport. The very back has fewer buildingsindoors. Right side looks fairly revamped with the cannons sticking pretty far out that structure in general. Seems like the ramp  cave entrance to BB was heavily changed for launch but cant make out too many details. Left side right at  with the cannons seems removed to make room for functional transport boat for launch. Distinct lack of NPCs but that couldve been for video purposes. Old ogre models look hilariously bad. Vanilla retail doesnt look much better though. Gun  bow projectile firing animation at  matches retail fire wand animation. Definitely placeholder. Blackrock Mountain interior looks identical to finished product. Good to know that Blizzard had a specific aesthetic for it and kept  it intact long before launch.,ElysiumProject,deelhp1,26,t5_3hi6u

11063120,0,t1_deln76x,Luna unit frames includes HealComm addon that shows the incoming heals info. Its not Luna Unitframes itself. You can use healcomm with any unit frame addon you like.I think the other addon was smartheal and one other addon that includes healing in that prediction cant remember the name of this atm  that you can build into luna macro mouseclick healing. It will automatically downrank the casted spell based on the health of the target. The macro syntax is explained in Lunas github page.This is more usefull in man gaming since in raids example tank health moves around so much that the prediction is not working as you want anyways. And you are pretty much ALWAYS precasting stuff.Decursive is nice but if you use it in raids make SURE you use the priority feature OR do it manually. It will just waste your mana on certain bosses dispelling example mana bomb from classes that dont have mana. In MC there are bosses where you absolutely need to just do dispells and leave healing to others.While active downranking is nice you have to take into account the  second or is it s regen rule. If you dont RELEASE a spell in  seconds you will start regening with full  rate. Spamming heals means you are always in the  regen. So do change your healing based on the incoming damage how many people are healing the current target. But then again on downranking you can try to proc inspiration on the main tank. This should be divided between different healers spam low rank heals for procs. Max rank Greater heal heals so much that its most often  overheals. So if you cast this remember to cancel it if its not used in a good . Canceling cast can get you into the  regen and make your base mana pool last a LOT longer.I do have a bislist google doc but dont have the link here.,ElysiumProject,delzj09,1,t5_3hi6u

And the lower the population is the harder it gets to pay that bill donationsObviously at this point we arent exploding in growth so retaining players is a must.There are also cases like people doing benign things like multiboxing or logging on two accounts which hardly warrants a permaban.At the same time Pottu was fairly active with bansforumetc so this explanation doesnt strike me as odd.Perhaps Pottu didnt like the way a warning system might paint the project maybe Pottu was set on permabanning rule breakers.

If you are ok with gold selling botting not blizzlike servers then thats fine. However its not as if people just randomly decided to shit on Elysium. They were given responsibility from Nostalrius when they took in their player base and code and that responsibility was to have a clean blizzlike experience.That is not happening.So yeah continue to call people entitled just dont be surprised when you hit  and there are no raiding guilds and under  pop.Its not like all these members of the team are choosing to leave for some random reason or because people on Reddit are shittalking them.

11611860,0,t1_dgb2b59,Human beings only practice behavior that is rewarded and they stray from behavior that is punished. If there are no police men in the town it is inevitable that people will rob stores. You may think you are better than everyone but when everyone who you know is robbing and then your family is robbing your brain starts to think robbing is the norm and no one is punishing you for it so then you also end up doing it. Same thing with the stun exploits if Elysium doesnt punish it people will do it I fully blame Elysium not the players. That is why in life I try not to blame people for their actions because in truth there is no one to blame just the chaotic causality of the world we are part of a effectgtcause deterministic environment that we cannot escape. gtbasic fucking decencyIf you think that exists in anyone you are either very young or just very stupid.

11634107,0,t3_65zqq7,Both become VERY strong with good gear especially once you start seeing AQ gear but before that shaman is significantly more difficult to gear for pure elemental. Both can absolutely destroy people but eles are slightly more dependant on cooldowns and luck to really wreck shit. However shaman are far better in groups as shotgunning lightning bolts is extremely easy to do and extremely dangerous if left alone.

11753950,0,t1_dgsbqyy,K so theres our problem. Weve found the root. World pvp isnt fair. You want a fair fight he says no TADAAA were done here. You need to align your expectations with reality and youll be much happier. Look anyone with some experience knows if you jump a rogue and for some reason that little shit doesnt reset on you and instead fights you with that huge disadvantage of no opener and you have to burn some pretty choice consumables to still pull off the kill you should not be proud.  HOWEVER its way more egregious to do the classic  yearold play of altlogging and moaning. Man up here. He caught you with your pants down you let this happen you opted to continue the fight either by choice or by not being prepared so this outcome writes itself. What you do next is up to you and you chose poorly. Do yourself a favor download Roadhouse and take notes on everything Dalton does. Its a crash course on subtle badassery and how to be a man in combative situations. ,ElysiumProject,dgsc8nn,5,t5_3hi6u

11781653,0,t3_67wsyj,The HP regen bug has to be because a mob is resseting out of combat due to a faulty grid in the mmap calculation whenever a mob target a player on an unreacheable place it will reset back to its default spawn point the THING is sometimes it is triggered by an incorrectly compiled mmap grid. Its a difficult fix to be honest...Another example would be on most servers the wooden bridges on Thousand Needles most of the time the AI of the NPCs bugs on these bridges hunters pets and warlock minions too,ElysiumProject,dgvhl6c,2,t5_3hi6u
