216137,0,t3_1wkvn4,One thing that kind of bugs me is that Courtney Lee has been a huge part of this turn around as well and isnt really getting any mention. His outside shooting and just shooting in general has really helped space the floor for the other guys.,memphisgrizzlies,cf329do,8,t5_2s5rf
224163,0,t3_1woa72,I dont know how you could start TA over Courtney Lee. He has been a revelation to our offense. In terms of starting them together I could be into that as TA can guard bigger guys... It may more likely be a closing lineup in games where we need a lockdown guy at the end. The reality is that JJ and Lee are better than average defenders and both more skilled offensively than TA. I for one would be looking to parlay Prince and another piece into a solid rotation player. Prince has had flashes where I say wow he really came to the rescue there  but I dont think he still has starting level production on the Grizzlies and he doesnt help create offensively. Id rather bring Miller TA and potentially another shooter creator off the bench to supplement needs and dictate style with Lee and JJ starting. Worth noting  when Pondexter is back we will be even more redundant at that wing position. ,memphisgrizzlies,cf3z75x,1,t5_2s5rf

But since the Grizz have done the Pros and Tams jerseys Id guess the NBA owns the trademark for all three as ABA names. The Nashville minor league team founded in  supposedly copied the name of the Memphis ABA team. Grizzlies was an established minor league and college name but the NBA owned the trademark before the Vancouver team was started. The NBA owns a couple other names and trot them out anytime a name change is discussed. I believe one of them is Dragons. The original name of the Grizzlies was going to be Vancouver Mounties before the actual Mounties put a halt to that.

Vince was good depth at the time he was signed  just play him enough in the regular season and then let him do his postseason magic in the postseason like he did with Dallas until he tore tendon in his foot and lost a lot of ability not to mention recovering from the Bone Spur removal surgery. But as it stands we have C. Lee TA Jordan Adams and VC moving forward. Plenty of depth there especially if Joerger wants to run  line ups some more.SF though was a dumpster fire. Green and Tayshaun were the only legit SFs on the roster. Need more depth there unless Joerger continues with the  line ups in which case just need to use Jeff Green off the Bench to play the  and the  in small ball lineups.As for PF Leuer regressed a lot this season might have lost his confidence when he was asked to start for ZBo and was ultimately replaced by Jarnell at that point. If Jarnell is ready he will be a solid back up to ZBo. But then we still need a rd PF unless Green just starts to work out and play the  if ZBo or Jarnell get injured.As for the  K is the best back up big but hes likely to walk this offseason so he needs to be replaced.So when I say we need a deeper bench we need  or  more guys who can play the  or a  because we will have  guys on the bench moving forward. Vince as much as I love him should consider retirement  he tore a damn tendon in his foot at his age it might be best to just hang it up.

I was a huge fan of him in Houston but he was a huge bust in Dallas and his injuries make me nervous given our past season. Im also not that hot on Kent Bazemore... the advanced numbers dont really like him and hes set to be overpaid. Id be happy signing him as a backup but not for the  mill he may get on the open market. Here are the guys that Id like for us to aggressively pursue Jared Sullinger Evan Turner Nic Batum  Joakim Noah Pau Gasol Donatas Montiejunas Ian Mahinimi Kevin Martin at a nice discount he could be exactly what we need when Marc and ZBo are healthy and create space Greivis Vasquez still salty about losing him Carroll and Lowry  Rajon Rondo call me crazy but I think hed fit in on this roster perfectly especially if we lost Conley... wed just need to get a better shooting core around the wing but he and TA on D... damn son,memphisgrizzlies,d4s7fur,0,t5_2s5rf

Mike will do a behind the back pass because he knows Marc is open on the perimeter. Marc will do a give and go where he hardly even needs to see Mike to know where hes cutting. Theyre so good together because of continuity theyve done these plays hundreds of times and know how each dude is gonna be spaced and everything.The idea is that you build that continuity with Parsons so when his shot starts falling Mike and Marc and everybody already know the types of plays hes gonna be trying to make.,memphisgrizzlies,ddgxgky,3,t5_2s5rf

Terrible nonsensical rotations and total lack of understanding of how to counter other teams.The Nets spent the entire night outrunning us and driving right by us into the paint.How does Fizdale respond? Plays Brandan Wright and Marc Gasol our only paint protectors in at the same time against the Nets small ball lineup whos draining threes then sits them BOTH and we have absolutely no paint presence and concede millions of easy drives.On offense Zbo and Marc are BOTH constantly getting doubled as soon as they receive the ball in the paint and have nobody to kick it out to reliably because Fiz decides this is the game to give Andrew Harrison and Toney Douglas WHO CANT SHOOT FOR THEIR FUCKING LIVES tons of minutes. This was the perfect game for Troy Daniels to play. My fucking God Fizdale sucks. The amount of possessions where we took a tough contested shot at the end of the shot clock was obscene.

In my opinion that was the peak of this team. No backup point guard would have changed that. You could add  Jason Williams to this team and they would be a lot better but they would win against the Warriors. Whats really sad is that you have watched these past  years and you think that the Grizzlies have nothing to show for it. Championships are not everything. There is only one team that wins a championship each year and realistically there are only  or  teams who have a realistic shot.  before  in  Yet you say we have nothing to show for it. In  there were still people convinced that the team was gonna move to Nashville! Yet you say we have accomplished nothing.Tell me do you think the Tigers accomplished nothing between .When Auburn beat Alabama with the kick six but lost in the national championship did they accomplish something?When the th seeded Grizzlies beat the team with the best record in basketball did the accomplish nothing?Hell yes they accomplished something they did something that is literally more rare than winning a championship.
