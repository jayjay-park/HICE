21313,0,t3_1uchyk,this is a toy that you hang from a tree or ceiling beam etc. It dispenses food as the dog leaps to tug it. Would be impossible for your mastiff to chew as it is suspended above reach plus it has the added benefit of exercising the dog as well as entertaining them.freezing wet food in a Kong also works better as the dog has to lick and lick at it for a good half hour to defrost all the food. Canned food or fresh mince works well for this. another thing i do is fill a kong with dried biscuits pour boiling water over them and freeze. the biscuits absorb all the water and then freeze solid which proves to be a very low cost boredom buster. buster cube is good too as the dog has to really push the toy around to get the food out cant vouch for its durability though.also worth considering is that the exercise youre providing for your rescue dogs could do with a bit of variation.  miles of running will tire them physically but it does not provide them with much mental stimulation and also has the sortof downside that you are creating extremely fit dogs who will need more and more exercise to exhaust them! Of course you should not stop exercising with them but consider adding more mental exercise to their routine e.g.  miles running and then  minutes with each dog doing trick trainingshapinggames with toyshide and seek games. also consider varying where you run so that they are exposed to new places more often this is much more exciting and tiring to a dog than always running the same route. this will hopefully leave them feeling much more tired. ,dogs,ceguyg2,1,t5_2qhhk

Shes been acting strange since New Years day and on New Years Eve we had some friends over and everyone was blowing noise makers which scared our dog a lot now that I think about it. Do you think something like that could affect her for a couple days? I had everyone stop playing with the noise makers once I noticed it was scaring the dog.

30114,0,t3_1ugcd7,Is there someone at home to look after him durning the day?Also puppy proof your house seriously puppies will eat everything within their reach. Make extra sure medical stuff like tablets are out of the puppies reach. My cat and and dog will both drink the bucket of water I use for washing the floor! So I have to lock them out of the room.Also be careful with the front door! I had to install a baby gate to prevent mine from running outside. Now I dont have to worry about other people opening my door and letting my dog outside. Youd be surprised at how careless people can be.Also look up the list of foods that are dangerous to dogs.I dont have a big garden and my dogs recall isnt the best so I have a  foot leash that I use to play with him outside. We play fetch and run around and its a good time to practice his recall.Dont let th puppy follow you everywhere as it can cause seperation anxiety. Practice leaving him alone for a few minutes at a time.Take him everywhere to expose him to different things so he doesnt become fearful. ,dogs,cehuzn4,2,t5_2qhhk

If you did and since Ozzys  yrs old I would try to trust that they didnt let you adopt a dog that you dont have time for.If you didnt have that type of conversation or even if you did I guess! Id ask you how things have gone for the last couple of days?  Does Ozzy seem pretty chill content to just hang out most of the time?  For super mellow older dogs a walk around a block or two couple of times a day might be enough...Basically whether or not Ozzy can be properly cared for with a schedule like yours depends very strongly on his temperament and energy level.Hope this helps and also hoping that Ozzy IS a completely mellow laid back guy so you can rest easy now and go back to just enjoying him...,dogs,cekysum,3,t5_2qhhk

They are a sighthound breed that originated in England where they descended from greyhounds. Whippets today still strongly resemble a smaller greyhound. Shown in the Hound group Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia. Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing agility and flyball.gtWhippets were originally greyhounds that were deemed unsuitable for hunting because of their size. They were returned to their peasant breeders after being maimed so that they could not be used to hunt and break the Forest law. These maimed dogs were bred together and used to catch rats and hunt rabbits. When the Forest law was repealed these miniature greyhounds became popular in the sport of dog racing. This has led to Whippets being described as the poor mans racehorse. They are still frequently used as racing dogs today as they have the highest running  ...

Basically it means checking out that you are a decent person and meet the general qualifications. When a dog youre interested comes through you just have to submit an interest in that dog. If it looks like a good match then theyll go from there. One group requires you to fill out the same information over and over and over again. Youre interested in Fido? Fill out these  questions.

157415,0,t3_1vuk6q,How is he supposed to know what hes done? Dogs dont sit around and go over every time theyve gotten in trouble. He likely has no idea why he is currently being treated differently. The big problem now is you guys are afraid of him. You say hes too old to be trained which is completely ridiculous. If he were  and arthritic with cataracts and an unstable bladder hed still be trainable. You have two male dogs one or two? of which is not neutered you have them free roaming the house with very little boundaries. He came down with an illness and is being grumpy because of his medication and you think he should be euthanized? What is the time line here how long has he been on meds? When exactly did he get lyme disease? Why isnt he neutered? Why is it a surprise that an unneutered male would wander? What if he smells a female in heat do you expect him to stick around when hes let out unsupervised?There are so many things wrong here I dont even know where to start. Bites that happen out of nowhere are rare. If you know body language and basic dog skills you can often see posturing or a certain eye contact hackling etc that give it away before it happens. Without witnessing the incidents its hard to say why the dog has bitten. Im sorry about your mother but it sounds like a lot of red flags were happening before she was bitten and nothing was done to address them or prevent another bite.Dogs are work. They are a responsibility. If they are having problems you cant ignore them to make them go away. If he hasnt seen a trainer or a vet since the bite incident how is he supposed to get better? If your parents are unwilling to take the steps necessary to understand the reason behind the bite then perhaps it would be best if he were euthanized. Living locked in a basement with the only human contact being owners that are now afraid of him isnt a happy life for a dog. And for the well being of your other dog get a trainer. Not because your second dog really needs it but because it sure as hell sounds like your parents do.,dogs,cewd0rx,3,t5_2qhhk

The adrenaline spikes which he can smell. He growls some more you yell and it gets to be bigger. The key is to learn to CALM the situation before you try to make your point. You have to let go of the fear. The fear is making you angry which means the dog wins. The dog wins because you are not on control. Anger is not in control. Assertive is control. Anger is aggressive. So lets do the you walking into a room issue. You walk in. Dog growls. Look up  NO eye contact yet!!!  You need to stand still. Head up. Shoulders back. BREATHE. Keep breathing. Let the fear run through you but dont do anything other than hold your ground. Stand tall and breathe until you are calm.  Dont talk. Dont move forward or backwards yet. If you want to prove you are bigger and badder than the dog you absolutely MUST remain calm and hold your ground. Dominant dogs and people just walk in and own what they want. They do it calmly and with few words or gestures. They are the people who move to their own tune. Thats dominance. What you were doing was aggressive to an already aggressive dog. You are going to get yourself bit. By the time your heart has slowed and your breathing is calm Im almost willing to lay money the growling will have stopped. When you are really really really calm and the growling has slowed or stopped take ONE  CALM NOT ANGRY step forward and firmly say no. Then point and tell him to go lay down. Even if he is laying tell him to go to his bed. If the growling starts back up which it probably will  hes testing you  same thing. Go back to head up and breathing. Just hold your ground. Dominance is just about claiming a space. Ita absolutely not about force. Throwing him outside is forceful and probably aggressive. The most balanced dominant dogs you will meet claim absolutely silently and with solid body  language. The dont bark or growl or invade the other dogs space. The just walk in and take over. You are escalating this behavior by yelling and not being calm. If you are trying to do a Cesar Milan thing by claiming or being the baddest you need to watch the episodes with Daddy. YouTube it. Thats calm and assertive dominance. That dog was freaking amazing. Thats the body language you want. Only in people form. Dont watch the human watch his dog. My huge CoonhoundGerman Shepard mix is on her way to being that. She rarely makes noise gets along with almost any dog but no one gives her shit. She is always calm. Always dominant and always always in control because she is always calm. ,dogs,cezvkn0,-13,t5_2qhhk
194290,0,t3_1wbyxm,Speed is dependent far more on structure physiology terrain and drive and heart than training. A policemilitary trained GSD should have pretty solid structure and a lot of drive. Terrain would obviously vary. But you could expect a dog to hit around mph or  meters per second. Basically a football field in about  seconds. The record for a human is  seconds.

Some of the more independent guarding breeds such a great pyrenees may do ok left out alone on a farm but even then they have the company of the flock they are guarding. But I would not recommend a dog like this to guard a more suburban property. Again he would be a huge liability. Wanting a dog for their usefulness isnt necessarily a bad thing but it should be something the dog was actually bred to do and enjoys doing. Being left in the yard and expected to protect it is a very boring life for any dog.

228962,0,t1_cf4dmec,After two or three times dogs do know what the word no means.  Should we never give commands because dogs dont understand them the first time?  In regards to dog training dogs dont know no is the stupidest thing Ive ever heard and its popped up here several times within the last month.  No doesnt have to mean I AM GOING TO FUCK YOUR SHIT UP DOG it just means Stop your current action voluntarily or I will stop it for you. I am displeased with your behavior. and for most peopleoriented dogs thats enough of a punishment.You should always redirect the bad behavior to something desirable obviously.  In the context of this example dont just take the shoe awayHere is this chew bone instead.  I shouldnt have to live my life in extremes to stop my dog from failing by putting food on top of the refrigerator or needing to lock up guests shoes in a closet or elevated bin.  Admittedly my standards for good dogs are very highI do expect strict obedience and its no surprise my dog functions at service dog standards in close to all situations and I couldnt have reached that level of obedience and selfcontrol that is my dogs level of selfcontrol without making it clear that X is something I never want him to do again.  Using only the word no as positive punishment and lots of cheese for reinforcement I am now able to release him on a squirrel halt him midstride and call him back to me reliably a feat that has garnered a rather esteemed compliment from a K officer trainer.  In a similar vein I can tempt my dog all I want by leaving a steak or even ten steaks on the floor and he will not so much as go in for a sniff.  Thus my experience tells me that the concept of dogs dont know no is absolutely ridiculous and furthermore that  positive reinforcement is insufficient.  I am certain that applying only R P would not achieve the feats I described above particularly in cases where I have no control over the stimulus re squirrel.  It is nearly impossible to break the focus of a highly driven dog by waving food under its nose or offering a toy.  I do think the majority of every single dogs training program should be positive reinforcement.  Reward the good make the dog want to perform good behavior make the dog think it was his idea all along and youre just a sucker with a bag of treats.  But the judicious use of positive punishmentalmost exclusively in the form of a verbal correctionis an invaluable tool that the  positive reinforcement crowd seems to have been brainwashed against using for reasons completely inexplicable to me.,dogs,cf4ha6m,-1,t5_2qhhk
230832,0,t3_1wqwbm,This is referred to as reactivity if he is mostly focused on dogs dog reactivity if it only happens when he is on leash leash reactivity.It can be hard to tell if dogs are doing it because they are just very reactive or because they are frightened and going aggressive. My dog would bark and lunge towards dogs but if he actually met them he would just sniff them and even try to play. That said his body language was very stiff and intense which can cause fights and he would growl at or alpha roll some dogs dogs that were scared of his crazy behavior!. It doesnt exactly matter because you can fix both with the same methods. I likeBAT TrainingFeisty FidoControl UnleashedThey all have some overlaps the two main things you do are desensitize your dog to the stimulus slowly and from far enough away that your dog can stay under control and use counterconditioning if he is associating seeing dogs with scary stuff you make him associate seeing dogs with good stuff.I went through almost the exact same thing with my German Shepherd at the same age except he was not reactive to people and very reactive to dogs. I took a lot of obedience classes even if the trainers didnt really have a clue there were no classes in my area aimed specifically at reactive dogs I would just work with my dog on maintaining focus around other dogs. We would work outside of fenced in dog parks where my dog could see other dogs. We would sometimes work near the entrance to Petco but not so close that we could accidentally get too close to another dog this can be difficult and may not be a good idea.We treat for not barking and have him do a command when he sees a dog rather than pulling then treat.This is basically what you have to do. If he cant do a command and is not interested in treats use really good treats btw you need to move further from the other dog.I also did the protocol for relaxation which I reaaaally think helped my dog with selfcontrol. You can google it. It is a very boring exercise where your dog just lays there and you do more and more crazy things and reward him for just laying there. You start in a boring place and repeat in more exciting places to teach your dog to be calm in all places.Dont do the Cesar stuff dont even try.

236866,0,t1_cf55cw3,Whether or not pet insurance is a good idea will depend on the policy how good you are with saving and a bit of luck. Some policies dont cover much and sometimes the premiums will end up being about what you pay out of pocket unless your dog ends up needing some really expensive treatments. With an older dog the chances for expensive health issues can be higher. I personally would rather just save the premium money and use that towards vet expenses but if you can get a good deal on a good policy it may not be a bad idea to consider it.Dont feel like you need to take a dog on your first trip. Dont feel like you need tot take the dog with the saddest story. Wait until you find one that is the perfect fit. Since you sound active you will probably have a lot of options. Sometimes the younger but higher energy dogs can actually be a tough place despite the age.

290951,0,t1_cfabc6o,You dont need to explain to me the information that can be found on a bag of dog food Im literate thanks. Obviously if Im interested enough to take the time to learn how to make all of my own dog food from scratch then Ive read and understood the guaranteed analysis that is listed on every bag of kibble. All that is is a breakdown of crude protein fat and fiber content by percentage. You could take a Big Mac and break it down that way also. Literally anything that is edible can be broken down that way if one was so inclined. It says nothing about the quality of the sources or the nutritional content. A white potato probably has roughly the same amount of carbohydrates as a sweet potato but nobody would pretend that those two vegetables are nutritionally comparable their qualities vary greatly. Thats why I took to time to explain why the ingredient list can be deceiving and used blueberries as an example of how something can be on that list to make the food look good when there might not actually be a significant amount in the food. The ratio of proteincarbsfiber is hugely important but its not the only factor its the minimum information one would need in order to make an informed decision. Nutrition is a complex beast whether it be for humans or dogs its naive to think otherwise. Kibble is processed food plain and simple. You wouldnt eat Kraft Dinner every day and expect to be the picture of health just because you added hot dogs to it would you?I am not trying to say that theres no such thing as high quality kibble. All I was trying to do was make a point that we arent given enough information to come to a conclusion of how any one dog food compares over another and that the standards dont necessarily change just because the price did. An ingredient list and crude general analysis doesnt tell you anything about the quality of those ingredients. Thats why I took the time to talk about cost and how even the more expensive dog foods are actually still suspiciously cheap when you do the math. You cant buy good meat for those prices but you can buy meat byproducts like fish heads. You get the stuff thats scrapped off the floors in the slaughter house after theyre done processing the human food. IMO theres nothing wrong with feeding that stuff to dogs its better than it getting wasted but dont fool yourself about what it is that youre buying. Thats all. ,dogs,cfax6xd,0,t5_2qhhk

314015,0,t1_cfcs70z,gt I guess the point is to specifically make it so you dont really make coin on the puppy you see people charging thousands because they can. When my youngest dog was two he had a cardiac exam Xrays of his hips and elbows an eye exam blood draw for thyroid status prcdPRA PRA and icthyosis. His Xrays were evaluated by Penn Hip and OFA his elbows were evaluated by OFA. Since then he goes to the ophthalmologist yearly for an eye recheck. He has working and conformation titles. Ive probably spent about  on health checks I dont want to think how much on competing. If hes bred most of his first litter will cost. Theyll be donated to one of the large service dog places near his breeder. Ill keep a puppy from that. I dunno so far I think Im in the hole on this whole thing. If hes bred to a personally owned bitch vs the service dog one odds are Ill get the cost of a puppy from that but more likely Id take a puppy. Again not exactly making back my money.The other males Ive owned I have not bred including a BIS best in show dog. They had health testing done were shown and were basically incredibly well loved money pits. I made not a dime on them other than maybe . from some puppy sweeps.My bitches were also not bred I came close on one and we did all the very expensive testing but decided to not. I dont really know people who breed dogs and do it well who make lots of money on it. THe only person Ive known to make money is the guy I worked with who I have mentioned here before who would breed his poor Pug when his family wanted vacation money. More typical is someone investing four figures in health testing and showing a dog and winding up with a litter of one or two.

There was someone on the cocker subreddit a few weeks ago trying to unload an Amish bought what looked like a Merle Cocker Spaniel that had routinely bit people they acted like it was no big deal. Also people who breed for rare colors. Merle is not a cocker color. Blue eyes are not found in Cockers the standard specifically states brown the darker the better.Every cocker should be issued with a full grooming kit and at least a week of monitored brushing so people realize these dogs need to be brushed.I think most of my issues arent necessarily breed problems as much as they are idiot owners buying bad dogs from worse people. I also agree with uMockingbirdRambler about the working titles  for me Id go even lower for some breeds. One of the cocker breeders I know has three of her dogs that are therapy dogs that go to the library once a week and let kids read to them. To me thats a worthy goal for a dog.

341830,0,t1_cfg6q9n,Its great that youre very closely supervising their interactions.  Just make sure you stop any inappropriate behavior as soon as possible.  Your pup is approaching some important developmental stages where a bad encounter can cause huge problems in the areas of dog aggressionreactivity.  I lived in a house with three untrained unsocialized dogs not mine my exroommates dogs so I feel your pain.  Its good youre taking the initiative to work with him.  GSDs crave a job to do and by giving him that activity youre making him happier than hes probably been in years.  Its always harder to walkhandle two dogs at once.  You basically have to start all over again with the turning around when they pull technique because dogs do not generalize very well.  Your puppy doesnt know that leash manners are expected when another dog is with you.  It may be okay to be pulled by them now that shes a puppy but when shes an adult it may be a different story so Id recommend training her to walk with another dog now instead of later.  Spencer is a year old and pulls when I walk him with Barnes and I wish I wasnt so lazy with that when he was younger.  Remember when I said dogs dont generalize well?  Thats what happened at your friends house!

350300,0,t3_1y1cbd,I disagree. We have a lot of dogs in our community and a lot of local businesses including our local Lowes allows leashed pets. Obviously owner discretion here is required. I have one dog who is aggressivesnappy so I would never take him in a store but my other dog is well behaved. He doesnt bother anyone and would never interfere with a service animal. Hell I have a baby too and the dogs are better behaved in public than she is! Owners should be responsible for their pets and their kids too which includes cleaning up after them if they have an accident and removing them for poor behavior.  But I see nothing wrong with kids or dogs being in public so long as they are leashed and vaccinated.  And service dogs are trained to avoid distractions so your argument really doesnt make sense. I personally go out of my way to patronize dogfriendly businesses. As do others in my community. Also Ive been in other countries where dogs in public places is really common including restaurant and cafs. Never seen an issue at such places probably because the dogs were so accustomed to being out and about. ,dogs,cfh2ra2,0,t5_2qhhk

We have altered these dogs to the point they live in constant pain and many die a very early death. I know thats probably not what the author intended to say when discussing purebreds but it is a fact we are breeding purebreds to death. No one is saying stop dog breeding in its entirety thats ridiculous to even pretend thats anyones argument but to say a purebred is better than a rescueshelter dog because with a purebred you know what youre getting youre dog will be healthier and have less issues would be laughable if so many people didnt believe it.    ,dogs,cfrxtgx,-2,t5_2qhhk
454768,0,t3_1zai2d,Hi I currently have a korthals griffon pup that I bought for Search and Rescue. Breed. It is pretty much up to the handler and what drives you are most familiar with and which ones you can harness into a search dog.  Any breed can be trained to work I know of a JRT mix who was a tracking dog.Are you looking for a tracking trailing or area? I personally did not want to have to teach a herding dog to hunt in air scent so I went with a hunting dog. If your dog does not have a high drive or motivation your chances of certifing are really low you cant train a dog to enjoy and live to work it is either something they are born with or not. Size a good compact dog is what I wanted I can hike a  lb dog out a few miles add  lbs and it is going to take longer.A short well insulated coat is going to protect the body without a lot of coat maintnance. My advice is to get involved NOW with the K team work with them a few year see what it takes to become a handler and let the knowledge flow from them!  Many teams have standards as far as age breeds and even if you can become a handler your first year.  Most teams require you to be SAR certified before you join the team but would welcome you at trainings until you are ready for your own k.I will post recomended reading in a few minutes. ,dogs,cfryf3p,2,t5_2qhhk

456193,0,t3_1zagz1,This is the response I got from a rancher in Canada when I asked her about this Coyotes are very smart. Science has not yet proven this theory however many people have witnessed this. Not every coyote would do this. I think it is very plausible sometimes the motive my simply be to breed and not necessarily to kill the pets. We had a yearling wolf that spent an entire summer on our ranch he was young had no pack and wanted companionship. He would try to lure our female guardian dogs but I believe his intentions where more for the looking for a mate motive rather than lure to kill. There are recorded cases where wolves have killed LGD. In a study in Calgary on urban coyotes who are not shy they did find the incidence of coyotes killing dogs was much lower than expected. Rural coyotes would possibly shyer simply as they are hunted more and so would tend to be less habituated than urban yotes.,dogs,cfs49m6,8,t5_2qhhk

There were nearly  standard poodles entered so chances are that the poodle was excellent.

I dont mean to sound naive theres always the possibility that there was some abuse in his past that we do not know about but if that were the case is there anything else that could be done to curb his licking?

654067,0,t1_cge86jv,gt Labs and Goldens tend to be highly active in the first  years of life but then Goldens especially there are some Labs that are eternal puppies they calm down a lot. Retrievers at that age Ive known are still up for anything and have energy when you need them to but are also content to chill. Not generally so with a lot of herding dogs.Actually a well bred dog of any breed including a high octane one should have an off switch.Think about the original purpose of these breeds if they were hunting dogs they had to hang out in a blind and then fetch fetch fetch. If they were herding dogs they had to keep the flock together and then go grab the ones who ran off.But in no case were they ever running non stop all day long. What Ive seen is a departure from that via some people who breed purely for sport as well as dogs who are bred for well money. The thing that leaves first is too often that really valuable off switch.When people talk here about how a dog needs  hours a day of exercise its clear that they have been dealing with dogs who lack the ability to just sit the fuck down and take a break. Think of a kid who has ADHD that is sadly what some of these dogs are like.  And to be honest I see far too many BCs running agility from breeders who breed for agility who totally and completely lack that off switch. They would be very bad farm dogs. Anyway Id expect a dog of a breed bred to work to have a high activity level into their old age with an off switch. The mindless relentless I have to do all the things now that some dogs exhibit is not correct for any breed. But I would expect as I said the dogs bred to work to retain an interest in doing things till very late in life. ,dogs,cgem86h,5,t5_2qhhk

664565,0,t3_21rfx9,You already called the landlord so the owner andor dog should be forced out the next time the landlord checks. They may get out of it if a vet has documented the dog as a mix not including pit but I guess thats up to your landlord. In the mean time if your dog is on a leash or contained and the other dog attacks it will totally be the pit owners fault. However if your dog isnt contained in your arms in the back of a truck with no leashnot in a crate has a leash on but you arent holding it etc then it gets a bit tricky more so if there is a leash law in your area then you will have a hard time proving innocence even if your dog died in the attack. If you dont already look into how to use a break stick. Even with studying and watching videos of how to use it the first time you have to use it in a real emergency will be difficult. Its hard to convey the sense of urgency and fear during the situation through guides.You cant call animal control on a dog before its done anything yet. If it bites or kills your dog if you call animal control on the dog depending on where you are they may register the dog as dangerous maybe do an evaluation first and give the animal back to the owners. If the dog bit you or another person and they were reported they pretty much get the same as above however with people they only get so many chances until they are possibly put down. If the dog causes serious harm to a person and mauls someone they can be put down after that attack regardless of how many chances they have left generally decided by a judge.If you want to avoid the attack you could figure out what times and where you can walk the dog without bumping into the pit owner. I understand if you feel like you shouldnt have to avoid the problem but it will only be temporary until she or the dog gets evicted. At this point since you pretty much solved the problem and just waiting for a conclusion Id try to avoid confrontation with the dog.,dogs,cgft6l3,2,t5_2qhhk

731364,0,t1_cgne5x6,gt I think what youre calling natural methods most people would call dominance theory Natural training is the term that natural trainers themselves use. I have never seen anyone use the term dominance theory except people in the positive training movement who want to disparage it. The main reason why its not a good term is that there is not one theory about dominance. There are dozens of different theories about dominance and if you count theories about dominance in humans there are hundreds. Here is a survey of some recent literature on dominance in dogs. ,dogs,cgnerqn,3,t5_2qhhk
731400,0,t1_cgncyyv,Thats not true. Vet school is the same length as medical school just as expensive and probably harder  the curriculum is almost identical but veterinarians have to learn about many different species. By most accounts its also more competitive to get into vet school. Veterinarians earns a DVM degree which stands for Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.I dont mean to bash on MDs so I apologize if I caused offense  I just mean to point out that veterinarians are equally qualified and educated as physicians but make less than half the salary on average. By academic standards veterinarians absolutely could have gone into human medicine if they had wanted to and its frustrating to be treated as second class doctors. As far as usefulness to society Im not even going to get into that  its not a useful debate because modern society would cease to exist if either profession was eliminated.Edit I think what was problematic about my previous statement was the use of the phrase quick buck. I certainly dont think going into human medicine is a quick buck but I couldnt really find an appropriate idiom to make my point. My apologies.,dogs,cgnex1h,0,t5_2qhhk
731762,0,t1_cgn0j45,I agree with this. I also think lots of people assume alpha or leader means dominating through force or that dominant is a negative term. I like to think I offer appropriate and fair corrections while setting clear consistent and fair expectations. I lead through protection confidence and necessity not because I think my dog is trying to oneup me but because if I fail as a leader somebody has to fill the roll. If the dog doesnt feel comfortable enough to follow then I am failing as a leader and I should expect unwanted behaviors to crop up. If undesired behaviors do show up I provide desirable alternatives and work harder to strengthen communication and understanding. ,dogs,cgngeci,2,t5_2qhhk

They are also extremely smart for being so small mine was the star of his obedience class...check out My JRT truly doesnt know his size he even prefers to hang with the bigger dogs at the dog park and can hold his own well when playing with them it helps that he is so fast. He will also roughhouse with my seven yearold nephew for hours they are best buds. He is the friendliest dog Ive ever known and absolutely loves meeting new people especially kids and will lick anyones face who gets too close. Just last week on one of our runs he stopped out of nowhere almost tripping me just so he could say hello to an old man sitting on bench. These guys can be dogaggressive though if you arent careful so you would have to make sure to socialize him while he is a puppy to keep that from happening..but other than that they are amazing dogs I cant think of a happier breed out there..heres DieselOh and they also come in smooth coat if you arent a fan of scruff..,dogs,cguzb96,2,t5_2qhhk

He has one knee that still pops out but fixing the one really helped. He hardly has any issues anymore and I am glad I did the surgery. The recovery was hard and he was in a kennel with a bandage on for about  weeks. Before I was able to do the surgery he was on glucosamine and did pretty well on it.

I guess the best way to look at it is to consider the fact that if they do follow through and put Gunner to sleep it opens up a spot for another. Boxer to be rescued and given a second chance. ,dogs,ch6d395,3,t5_2qhhk

905318,0,t3_24hhz4,DogKnobit drives me up the wall. The writing style just puts me through the roof its like listening to a  year old girl rant about what she wants hint she has no idea. This particular backandforth stream of consciousness is tough to follow. Honestly I dont give two shits what dogs are competing in the ring over. Performance events are about competing against yourself not trying to beat everyone else. If youre worried about beating other dogs rather than having the best teamwork possible you have bigger issues than whether or not mixes are allowed to compete. You have an attitude issue.If someone is going to whine because a Border Jack won they would whine if it was a purebred BC or JRT or Sheltie or any other breed winning. You cant stop whiners from whining. In my experience most people who stick with performance events stop blaming breeds for being better or given an unfair advantage and they learn to focus on their own dogs. Who the fuck cares if Missy the Mixbreed owner never wants to get a purebred dog? WHO CARES? There are thousands of mixes in shelters whod love to be adopted and trained for fun activities. Sure it sucks when responsible breeders cant find awesome homes. But you know what? Missy can get to know people who own or breed purebred dogs know what a responsible breeder is and serve as an educator for friends family coworkers etc. when people she knows are looking to get a dog. Missy may not want her own purebred dog but she can be a voice for responsible breeders. Missy can also be the voice against BSL and limit laws she can promote animal welfare she can support health testing. Missy can do a lot of things and by allowing her and her dogs access to AKC trials information can be readily available to her. Honestly I know very few people who are upset that mixes can compete. After seeing a Pumi at a dog show a friend of mine said it pretty well With all the FSS breeds and new Miscellaneous dogs I cant tell the new breeds apart from the mixes so whats it matter?  Really what does it matter? Its about the dogs.,dogs,ch76urx,7,t5_2qhhk

927006,0,t3_24qfmb,gt  Aspiring breeders who cant afford the competitions or have no interest in competing with their stock should not be discouraged from breeding.Strike one. No they shouldnt be breeding. If they cant be bothered to show their dog in some form be it herding agility conformation whatever their dog does need to be proven.gt  I understand why some working breeders have decided to not perform certain health tests whether because research has proven those tests to be ineffective or the breeder can clear the future generations by parentage. This I understand some breeds dont have issues with hip dysplasia so I wouldnt be overly worried if their hips werent tested. That being said they better be actually testing for what is a problem in their breed.gt I support dog breeders. Period. I dont modify that statement anymore because I dont need to. I have close friends in the commercial breeding industry and the show dog world. The only thing we need to have in common is a love for our animals. Isnt that enough?No its not for me. I want to see a breeder with a contract I want to see someone with an active interest in their dogs. Find me one commercial kennel that will happily take a pup back.I noticed they didnt even touch on puppy mills. Is that okay by the author as well? In my opinion puppy mills fall under commercial breeder. The local doodle dog mill near me is clean. Their dogs are allowed in and outside they are impeccably groomed and show no sign of abuse. They have a grooming salon they offer obedience classes doggy day care the whole gambit. I still refuse to support breeding nonhealth tested dogs to make designer breeds that they then sell for thousands of dollars. Those dogs that are not health tested that dont have contracts those are the ones that get dropped off at my shelter because Joe Schmoe sold them to someone who had no idea that their Husky wouldnt be happy running around a yard all day or that their border collie might nip at their kids. In addition to this I do have family members that do buy field tested dogs. I dont see the problem with that. Those dogs are still health tested have beyond wonderful temperaments and more importantly they can do the job for which they were bred. They may not come with contracts but I guarantee theyd take back a good hunting dog in a heart beat rather than have it go to a pound. If you are going to downvote me feel free to express your opinion as to why. I feel its probably because I brought up doodle dogs. I fully support the Australian Labradoodle Society who wants to make a breed.

Also the doctorpatient relationship is not unique to veterinary medicine and the Terms and Conditions for VetRounds are the same as Human Health question  answer websites that perform the same services.

1020898,0,t1_chkbme2,That may be true that it reminds you of past cases where something like this happened and rescues defended them but in this case its inappropriate  no rescue organization is defending him so its as nonsensical to say that people stealing dogs and justifying it by saying it was for their own good damages the reputations of rescue organizations as it is to say WARNING ANALOGY people kidnapping children and justifying it by saying it was for their own good damages the reputation of adoption agencies or child protective services.People seeing dogs as babies has little to nothing to do with the term adopting. Its useful to distinguish between getting a dog from a nonprofit vs. from a breeder. The people I know who most treat and refer to their dogs as their babies got them from breeders and say they bought them. Seeing dogs as no different from babies can be damaging to them but seeing them as no different from a chair or a purse can be too.

1106127,0,t1_chtzxhq, months does seem like a short time but it also feels like a really long time given how far weve come.  The fight happened before we started working with the behaviorist who really turned things around for us.  We went about the introduction in probably the worst possible way since we didnt know any better.  We simply had my parents bring their two male dogs over to the house and straight into the back yard like  or  weeks after getting Boris.  Hindsight is  but it seems obvious now how bad an idea that was.  So with that in mind I feel like the fight was more our fault than Boris.  Now we are trying to decide if we should wait longer or if getting one sooner would be better because he would have less time to grow a territorial feeling about the house.  I think it would definitely help his socialization progress though.,dogs,chu0v6l,1,t5_2qhhk

The animals are happy and content except for one small thing they each miss someone very special to them who had to be left behind.They all run and play together but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group flying over the green grass his legs carrying him faster and faster.You have been spotted and when you and your special friend finally meet you cling together in joyous reunion never to be parted again.

Ive been looking for a good replacement but a collar or flasher to clip to the harness has always seemed better as it was directly attached to the dog.How is the build quality of these things?

1135378,0,t3_274j5m,Start as you mean to go on. Decide on your house rules how you will train etc and stick to it as soon as you get home with the dog. Be gentle but firm and always consistent. Our trainer always says to set the dog up to succeed so dont push too quickly or expect something you know they cant do we knew Bronze was terribly leash reactive to everything so only walked him late at night and where it was guaranteed to be empty or walked away from anyonething. He was too scared to handle it and we needed to do a lot of building up to it no matter how much we wanted to be able to just walk him down the road during the dayI do think these are probably all behaviours that are possible to work on but would be best handled by someone experienced or a behaviouristtrainer. It isnt clear fro your post if its this dog you plan on adopting or another one. If you plan to adopt the dog then you will likely need to get a behaviourist in to help you. In the mean time watch as many kikopuptraining videos as you can and read up  learn your limits learn how to read the dog and take it all slowly.  If this isnt the dog youre going to adopt you might be better off going through a foster organisation and getting them to set you up with an easier dog think owner handin but a wonderful and trained dog. Im afraid this sounds like a situation setting you up for a miserable time and badly behaved dogs will make you exhausted and then any nervousness your SO has will be well founded and hell only have negative experiences.Thats my two cents. But as far as some specific things you have mentioned   Get a crate. Work on crate training if she causes chaos when youre out. Bronze still pulls apart the bin if we leave him in the kitchen so we put a puppy gate up and keep him in the other side of the house  if he never gets to do it he is never rewarded for it theres always something hell eat in the bin! If she doesnt walk well look into a halti lead and start some training. That nose... keep her leashed. You can buy a long line basically leash material that is  feet long we have a ft one and keep her on it if you do decide to let her run in a field also make sure its a secure field! If you dont have recall down or  faith in the dog then dont let it off a lead until you do. But nose work is great and can really help you tire her out.  If in doubt  squeezy cheese. Primula is doggy crack according to our trainer and she is right. Carry some everywhere and treat like theres no tomorrow to being with  this sounds like it will be like training a puppy and that means back to basics with obscene amounts of praise.  Youre right about keeping her out the bedsofa and definitely work on an off command. Dont try and move her physically or by pulling her collar etc instead lure her off of things.

1137995,0,t3_275or6,This is the only thing I knew about Apollo before I adopted him. He was black and tan listed as a cocker spaniel and was a neutered adult that turned out to be a lie but whatever.I filled out all of his paperwork a week in advanced while he was in the strayhold. AM the morning of his release they brought him to me and that was it. I really really lucked out with him. Now to be fair there is a difference between going to animal control and grabbing the first dog you see and actually looking at petfinder talking to the rescue or foster parent etc.I think it depends on how dedicated you are. If you are prepared for the total opposite if you can handle it then you can try.

1142742,0,t3_274hia,Is your dog aggressive or just reactive? Many dogs are reactive to other dogs while onleash because they know they are confined and unable to defend themselves or flee if another dog attacks many are also reactive even when offleash. They put on a big aggressive show to warn the other dog not to come near. I would never use any sort of headhalter for any dog of mine but I feel like it would be especially terrible to use one with a panicking reactive dog I prefer a frontclipping harness like the Easy Walk personally.But if you really feel like a headhalter is what your dog needs Id take a look at ones that attach at the back of the head so that whenif your dog lunges his head isnt jerked dangerously to the side.

Its just the initial placement into the crate when we go to bed that she begins barking and howling. If we put her in there during the day to take care of things around the house she might whimper once or twice but thats it. Im guessing thats because she can hear us walking around and see us as we pass through the kitchen where her crate is.

If neither one of those things are not possible she needs to place one or both dogs. The way shes handling things now shes a menace. If she had done this to some dogs shed have had a major huge deadly dog fight. And it would be  her fault. She knows she cant handle the two and shes still walking both at once. As far as your dog wanting to say hi  Who cares? Your dog gets to decide these things? Nope. Nope. Nope. Your dog is not allowed to decide that he wants to go charging up to dogs. Most dogs dont view that as this is fun!You wrotegtIt sounded vicious and all but nothing that Ive not seen my own two dogs do when they accidentally get forced into each others personal space while on a leash.You may be ok with living with chaos and on the thin edge of my dogs arent fighting yet but most of us really dont want to be part of that world. Again your mom needs to change how things are done in the dog walking part of her life. I used to have a  pound reactive dog. And my  year old niece wanted to walk that dog and no other. Do you really think I let her do that? Um no. That would have been stupid and shown poor judgement. Your mom walking two untrained dogs one of whom is reactive both of whom outweigh her?

1209189,0,t3_27yjxq,gtthe times we put him in when he has accidents.This is just because youre cleaning up right? Its important not to associate the crate with negative behavior. If you yell at him and throw him in the crate hes not going to want to be in there. If you can calmly put him in and need a break thats fine but dont turn it into a bad thing to be crated. I dont think crating is cruel by any means but I think daily crating for many hours is. At nine weeks they may be able to hold it for  hours but it really isnt pleasant. We took our dog out every  hours sometimes every  minutes. She never made a mess in her crate but we were always cutting visits and trips short because thinking of her lying in her crate with a full bladder trying hard not to pee always made us feel guilty. A couple hours is fine  is pushing it. gthe should be sleeping the whole night anywaysDont expect that this young. Ours was crated whenever we left if I didnt feel like watching her it happens or at night. We set alarms for  AM and would make her get up and go out to pee. ,dogs,ci5nhdp,5,t5_2qhhk

1213697,0,t1_ci5q2qd,I had stopped rubbing her nose in her messes after the first day we had her.  As I has mentioned I was relying mostly from memory on how my family trained our family dog  years ago.  You mentioned a fair comparison about how one would treat a human child.  We do not have children and I was raised in a family that spanked.  Im not arguing against you I do agree with you  its the whole reason I posted in the first place.  Im simply explaining where my misconception is coming from.  I agree that they ARE outdated.  I dont need you to tell me I should feel ashamed...I clearly stated that I disliked the method I was using and the entire purpose of my post was to ask for help.  If I honestly felt that the only methods I knew were the right ones...do you really think I would have posted in the first place?We have been using puppy pads in designated areas throughout the house where she frequents.  I am slowly removing some of those areas now that she has grown some...to encourage her to hold it long enough to reach those areas.  She has not been scolded for any accidents since that first day.  When I HAVE scolded her its primarily been when shes getting too rough with a cat or is digging into something that is potentially harmful to her.  She has not displayed any behavior of fear.  She uses her puppy pads when we are in the room she has never tucked her tail in and hidden from either of us.  Keep in mind  I am not condoning the method.  I do NOT like using this method at all  which is why I posted.  I simply feel the need to state that had or if she ever displays any sign of fear or abuse it would be something I would immediately stop doing.  I appreciate your concerns and you are correct to have them...but I posted this out guilt.  I dont need to be scolded  Ive been doing that plenty on my own.  That being said I DO appreciate your advice.  You have given me alot of advice in greater detail than what was offered when I web surfed for suggestions.  The only concern I have is the tactic of using high value treats to promote good behavior IE  Human foods.  I HAVE been using these to promote good behavior however at her age...she has been testing the waters in everything.  I am having issues with applauding her good behavior TOO much with treats.  Her first week or two she had no problem eating her puppy chow.  At the time she was too small to get into much trouble and I spent time training her tricks sit shake etc. that she got treats for.  Weve reached a point now that she knows that if I say no not to do what she is doing.  She gets rewarded for being good but  Now it seems that she expects nothing but tasty treats.  It seems as though the tastey goodies have spoiled her to the point that she refuses to eat anything else.  How much is too much?  ,dogs,ci65qs4,2,t5_2qhhk
1214204,0,t3_2809cv,ok thanks for your thoughts. I absolutely do not want to rehome either one of course but also want them to be safe and happy. that is my main concern. I say the hound can seem unhappy at times when she kind of stands off in the yard to avoid the pit  mainly due to the pit controlling the toys. The hound also does not play neck and leg biting with other dogs but has conformed to this ones play style and I would not feel comfortable with either dogs playing this intense with someone elses dog say at a dog park or something. I would definitely be interested in seeing how your dogs play together. ,dogs,ci67su4,1,t5_2qhhk

1217922,0,t3_281wsv,My dog escaped last year from our backyard. He had tags on as well as a personalized tag with his name as well as my home address and phone number. I was so confused as to why no one called. The only thing I could think was that he had been badly injured killed or dognapped. Because he had tags!!But the next morning I was in the backyard and saw that his collar had come off as he squeezed through the fence. So he had nothing. I posted a missing dog ad on a website... as did the guy who found my pup. We met up and he said he aboslutely adored my dog and had already decided that if no owner came forward he was going to adopt my dog. My dog has a tattoo... the guy just hadnt checked that yet but he was going to. He even let my dog sleep in his bed over night with him aha.I quickly went out and ditched the collar that he had.

I know that when my current male dog hit puberty I spayed my bitch. She was about  or so and we had decided to not breed her. And while I could have left her intact I was leery of putting my dog walker in charge of hormone boy and an intact bitch. I know I could have stopped anything but i wasnt so sure of the dog walker.

Sometimes we go into another room and watch programs with animals on them so we dont have the animal alarm system going off every time an animal is onscreen.  When hes feeling spry he will hop up and get close to the tv and follow the animal around with his head.

I do not know anything about her history before I got her. I have tried rewarding her with treats while he was sitting on the couch but maybe the floor would be better.

I was walking towards them but I would have passed perhaps  meters in front of them and I was still about  meters to the side of them. My dog was on his lead and close enough I could put my hand out and touch his head. I was walking slowly and he was calmly walking along beside me  sniffing the odd thing on the floor.The two facing me saw the dog and kinda stopped talking and just looked scare this caused the guy with his back to me to turn round and see what was happening. As soon as he saw the dog he got to his feet stood on the bench and then jump over the seat back and coward behind the bench. He was just kinda peaking over and holding his hand out over the top of the bench like he was pleading with me to stop.Obviously I just stopped my dog noticed the movement and was now looking at him but hadnt really moved wasnt barking growling or even really reacting to the guy. The guy started shouting something and sounded as thou he was pleading for his life. It felt like everyone in the car park was starring at us. I took the dog out round the back of some parked cars and carried on where I was going the guy shouting the whole time with zero reaction from the dog who was about months old at the time and no where near fully grown.Obviously thats the most extreme example but i have come across fear factor enough to make me weary of passing Asians with the dog. I now make him sit over to the side or wait in a drive or something if there doesnt look like theyll be a big gap when were passing where perhaps wed of just walked passed a western. Its anecdotal at best but there does seem to way higher proportion of fearfulness in general that more western looking people. He is a bit of a polarising dog roughly around  adore him  are indifferent  generally mutter something about a big dog and shy away.

1340857,0,t1_cikekom,I completely agree with uSynaxis  and those articles are great resources.I dont think you should look as this event as a failure or as a sign of awful things to come you should look at this event as a success on the part of your dog! He did not bite or lunge at your child he gave warnings the growl and the barking. Those are the same corrections dogs give to puppies when theyre getting uppity. Is your baby a puppy? Heck no! But you can see why your dog may have reacted in that way.Though the reactions of your dog are frightening to you growling barking they are meant to frighten off your son because your dog doesnt know what to do when he approaches him. I dont think your dog is an aggressive dog I think you just need to help him defend himself from your baby help him find places he can relax and be near you but still out of reach of the baby.My dog was very much the same as yours when my son started to be mobile. When he realized the kid wasnt going to back off he started relaxing underneath the couch where he couldnt reach him and under the kitchen table where he could easily run out the other side before my son could get to him. It really IS a good sign that your dog didnt go nuclear and give a hard bite to begin with he sounds like a good dog whos trying to set boundaries the best way he currently knows how! ,dogs,cikgmza,4,t5_2qhhk

Most animals will flee at the sight of people Its about being responsible and intelligent with them to ensure you can protect yourself in dire circumstance.

Its almost like a feeling of what have i done do I really want to take this all on? Theres times where I feel like its too much or Im not giving them enough this was earlier before I had . A friend of mine actually compared it to when mothers get depressed after having kids. Its all that hype and excitement of getting a dog and the first few days are fun but once you settle into the routine and monotony of it you feel sad. I guess you can ask yourself if youd be sad giving up the dog? Or imagine if something bad happened to him would you be sad? I dont mean this in a way where youll find out you dont care at all but itll show yourself that you do care and that it is worth working to develop that bond with your dog. Also maybe doing something with him like walking or going for a hike might help bring you closer.Ill end by saying that you definitely are not alone in feeling this way and its up to you ultimately what you decide to choose.

1400814,0,t1_cirqfo6,gt I think its regional and I think its breed specific.Exactly.  I also live in Michigan and when looking for my dog I was looking into dogs in the Detroit area as my parents live there the Saginaw area as my SO lived there and the KalamazooGrand Rapids area as thats where I live.Easily  of the dogs were dogs I could not own.  Not allowed.  I live in an apartment that has breed restrictions.  No pits bulldogs staffies doberman akitas huskies shepherds  you get the picture.  Additionally no mixes of those breeds either.The rest were all small lap dogs like chihuahuas and there were some labs.  I was looking for a dog that could keep up with me on hikes but would also stay below  lbs as thats a common cutoff for dogs in apartments.Then a local rescue in the Kalamazoo area got a shipment of dogs from down south and Laika was in that shipment.  We think shes a beagle mix which makes sense as hounds in general are far more common down south.  There just werent dogs that were fitting my requirements.  Laika was basically put up on petfinder on Wednesday we met her at an adoption event on Saturday and we adopted her on Tuesday  I was going to wait until next Saturday to bring her home but the shelter cautioned they could only hold her for  hours and she was a popular dog.,dogs,cirvf3o,2,t5_2qhhk

I would say this would be a reason to call a nonemergency line unless the dog had already been in there for an extended amount of time or was showing signs of heat stroke. I think you handled it the best way you could at work. I reported a dog in a car once I may have had a few drinks in me to a restaurant I had been in and it basically turned into a them v. me until they went and got the dog out of the car.

Keep them separate when no one is home and until they are used to each other keep them in separate rooms. It takes a while and they may not be very comfortable at first but you can modify your dogs behavior. Truthfully it isnt fair for you to tell himher they cant get a dog but it is good you are communicating your feelings. My dog has essentially been an emotional therapy dog for me and he is an amazing companion. I am so happy we found each other he is adopted and he has truly made my life better. This is exactly how it could be for your roommate.  Again I dont know the situation but your roommate could really benefit from a dog. If it bothers you that much break the lease and find a new place. ,dogs,civ25h4,20,t5_2qhhk

The dogs hate it because its painful and it becomes a negative experience.Now that you know what happened please look how to groom your dog and brush him.

1547435,0,t1_cja44pn,Okay so theres generally two types of standards super duper specific and picky like the Pug standard and super vague and open to interpretation like the Saluki standard. Standards that are incredibly picky tend to be picky on areas that are not of importance like heads muzzle length eye shape head shape ear set blah blah blah can be dictated down to minute detail. Other standards are more along the lines of the dog must have a head and they leave it at that.Bulldogs Pugs Frenchies etc. all have standards that are incredibly specific with physical requirements. Adhering to that standard is damaging because the standard is written in an unhealthy way PLUS it is interpreted in an unhealthy way. Other breeds have relatively vague standards but it is interpreted into extremes Bloodhounds Bassets. And then there are other breeds who have pretty open standards and they are interpreted in a moderate manner Salukis Whippets. Weird damaging physical traits are the result of a really specific standards that require such a damaging feature b normal standards that are simply interpreted way beyond what is suggested. Actions to take if you love a breed that has extremes look into joining the breed club. The breed club dictates the standards and the judges education programs. Make connections with other enthusiasts and help make changes from within. ,dogs,cja8tak,14,t5_2qhhk

1596857,0,t3_2cjxyz, weeks is so young. The good news is that their personalities will change quickly as they learn things In my opinion its important for you to socialize your puppy with other dogs. If thats not a possibility then make sure youre informed about dog behavior and socialization and especially how it pertains to your dogs breed if you know it. If you understand how she sees the world and how she sees other dogs it gets easier to figure out how to convey things to them. When my dog was a puppy she was quite rambunctious too. I always felt bad that she would pull on other dogs ears and fur if it was long enough but she learned things from them she wouldnt have learned from me she learned how what she did upset other dogs and that it would cost her a playmate if she didnt change too. The more I watched her interact with other dogs the more I felt like I picked up on their language. Anyway thats what Im talking about and for me personally it helped.Unfortunately dogs play with their teeth and some are really vocal when they play. Dogs that are familiar with each other will literally just bite each others necks and hang there and it seems like the other dog doesnt feel a thing lol. From what Ive observed I work in a daycare there are usually two reactions from when a dog plays too rough The other dog squeals and both pause playing for a moment or the dog that is playing too rough gets a nasty response from the other dog. Ive even watched other dogs tell off mine when she was a puppy and it wasnt fun to watch other dogs get mad at her but she needed to learn her limits especially while she was small and didnt have  pounds to throw around! Obviously the younger they are the more resilient they are. But I think it has made her into an awesome playmate for most dogs now If your dog doesnt react to squealing then maybe give it a gentle reprimand when it bites you. I think my dog has learned to differentiate how she can play with me compared to dogs. If she gets bitey with me when we play I always just react either hurt or just by saying No and then stuff one of her toys in her mouth lol. I think that has definitely helped her distinguish what she can chew. If she does bite me too hard and I react she usually stops and looks at me as if to make sure Im okay.The bottom line is that your dog has more energy than it knows what to do with and lacks sufficient life experience to know how to behave. My advice would be to be firm about their limits with you  dogs have instincts sure but they will still grow up to be socially inept without proper instruction and development now.,dogs,cjggbih,1,t5_2qhhk
1600921,0,t3_2cmkop,Im sorry this all happened but I was so happy to finally hear a story of someone who had pepper spray and was able to ward off an attack.You went to the vet and your dog had bruising isnt that proof enough that her dog attacked yours? No way in hell would I agree to pay the vet bills from her dog breaking out and trying to attack. If he had attacked a person and they stabbed him with a pocketknife would they be expected to pay the damn bills?Im getting angry just thinking about this. Definitely report the dog to the city animal control whatever you have. Keep any and all bills records of conversations when it happened where etc. I dont know if this person is actually crazy enough to try to come after you for money but its good to have your butt covered. Are there any other neighbors who may have seen or had bad experiences with this dog? I would ask them to also speak to management about their negative experiences to prove your complaints arent coming from nowhere. ,dogs,cjgyr7f,16,t5_2qhhk
1602096,0,t1_cjh2c5h,I agree. Just one issue OP said the kennel charged full price for board they only offered to cover the vet bills. OP have you and the schoolkennel exchanged money in either direction? IMO you should be comped for the board and vet bills should all be billed to the school so they cant weasel out of payment. This could get expensive and it sounds like you dont have pet insurance. If youve paid them Id ask for  refund because they didnt honour the terms of their contract with you. I wonder what the condition of the other animals in their care is like? If the place treats every dog as shabbily as yours clearly was Animal Control or the SPCA might be interested in doing an investigation...In the end what truly matters is your dogs health.

1612117,0,t3_2crtej,Yes a dog will be apprehensive about opening its jaws and letting you have a peek if its not something that happens often. You should get your dog more used to it by offering treats each time she relaxes enough to let you open her mouth. A good way to do this is to push upwards on her top fangs and push downwards on her lower fangs with your thumbs on both sides. Give her a treat each time you are able to open her mouth. Shell get the point after a few treats. You can also assign a command to it for the future to let her know whats about to happen and to relax. Remember to watch her body language and make sure its not bothering her too much and if she tries to leave let her.What is she doing exactly that would make you say her jaw is itchy?,dogs,cjidhdg,1,t5_2qhhk

I dont know the whole distance of where both dog and girl was.

If you explain the situation to them that she is aggressive and has incontinence and that you cant afford to take care of her but are afraid shell just be put down if you give her to a shelter theyll probably take her. I would suggest rehoming her but that is going to be very difficult given her issues. So contact a rescue they usually have the resources to handle dogs like this.  Edit  Seriously? Who downvoted me for this? Hes obviously struggling to take care of the dog taking it to a shelter would be a death sentence with its temperament and health problems rehoming it would be crazy difficult so a pit bull rescue is the best bet.

But yes like most herding dogs cattledogs are considered extremely intelligent!In my experience they are very alert intelligent and eager to please. BUT... besides lots of exercise they NEED stimulation. You have to find them jobs to do since there are no cattle to heard in most households.One great way to channel their herding desire is to have them herd beach balls. Get a bunch of big balls and have your puppy push them with hisher snout into a group. You can also have a ball go under the couch and let your dog tease it out using his paws and wit.They are great at long complicated instructions. Sitstay until you leave the room then come to you through a specific route and rollover when they find you. The more stimulation the better behaved dog youll have.

1662822,0,t3_2de29w,Its technically twice the work when it comes to actual work things.  Twice the baths twice the nail trimming twice the cost of food vet bills etc.But its also a lot more dynamic and interesting IMO.  Getting a nd dog made our house less predictable and more fun.  Sometimes two dogs just randomly come charging into a room wrestling with each other.  Sometimes youre tugging with a dog and a nd dog comes out of nowhere and steals your end of the rope.  Sometimes they develop really strange personalities towards each other.We have the goofy young dog and the strict middleaged dog.  The older one literally keeps the younger one in line by getting up in his face when hes acting stupid barking at nothing chasing a house fly pawing at toys stuck under the couch etc.  Its hilarious to watch her run up and scold him with a point blank bark in his face when hes being a goofy idiot.I think its worth having  dogs if you really enjoy dogs and love to watch them interact and play.

Its basic genetics.Heres a good article on this.You should also look at this recent study.ResultsGenetic disorders differed in expression. No differences in expression of  genetic disorders were detected between purebred dogs and mixedbreed dogs ie hip dysplasia hypo and hyperadrenocorticism cancers lens luxation and patellar luxation. Purebred dogs were more likely to have  genetic disorders including dilated cardiomyopathy elbow dysplasia cataracts and hypothyroidism. Mixedbreed dogs had a greater probability of ruptured cranial cruciate ligament.Conclusions and Clinical RelevancePrevalence of genetic disorders in both populations was related to the specific disorder. Recently derived breeds or those from similar lineages appeared to be more susceptible to certain disorders that affect all closely related purebred dogs whereas disorders with equal prevalence in the  populations suggested that those disorders represented more ancient mutations that are widely spread through the dog population. Results provided insight on how breeding practices may reduce prevalence of a disorder.,dogs,cjq6a0b,1,t5_2qhhk

These sorts of campaigns do more harm than good to the breed as a whole. Novice or casual owners get persuaded by the pibble propaganda that pits are great family dogs. They go adopt one and end up in way over their heads. The dog either lives a substandard life without its needs being met or ends up back at the shelterpassed around on craigslist. Its a HUGE problem and is driven in large part by these sorts of campaigns. Pit bulls arent aggressive monsters but theyre not labs either. Portraying them as such is damaging. ,dogs,ck7dmfg,2,t5_2qhhk

Again your anectdotal information is definitely respected and your experience it seems at face value is more than mine so I definitely take what youre saying to heart just IMHO I feel the feeding amp timing issue to be something that I prioritize with my dog more than you may.gtIm not sure why you thought I was downplaying the severity of bloatI guess I mistook what you said inititally heregtIt shouldnt be a big problem.

1834595,0,t1_cka8xqe,Blue is genetically possible in the APBT but since the breed has been bred for performance not looks it was very rare to get it. Additionally back in the day most blue dogs were culled. So you just dont get blue APBTs. Eventually the Am. Staff branched off and became its own breed. They have been bred mainly for the show ring and looks so blue dogs started popping up. Ive heard some people say mastiff had to be added to the Am. Staff to get blue but I dont think thats true. When the American Bully was created they used blue dogs from Am. Staff kennels as well some mastiff breeds. Now blue has become very popular with that breed Ive even run into some people that think Blue Nose is the breeds name no matter what color the dog is. Unfortunately when kennels are producing dogs for color alone problems like OPs are very common. ,dogs,cka9iak,-1,t5_2qhhk

From what Ive seen posted here over and over is that a  minute walk in the morning and at night is not enough.  I was under the impression that the major factor in determining is this breed right for me is activity level.  If I am understanding you correctly a  minute walk in the morning a  minute walk at night and a  minute game of offleash fetch somewhere in between that is enough exercise for GSDs BCs etc.  I guess I was under the impression that high energy breeds needed more exercise than just that.

2005320,0,t3_2hpm05,Recall handler focus targeting heel sit and down are the core skills. Some clubs require you to either pass  levels of their obedience courses or have a CGC title before you can compete in agility  this is just to ensure that everyone in the class has some measure of reliable behavior. It may be worth aiming for the CGC and knowing what your club requires before you can join. It would also be worth working on rearend awareness toy drive and desensitization to shifting surfaces with a wobble board. Id strongly recommend starting with a Foundation agility class instead of beginner agility  Foundations will teach you some of the basic rules of agility the different crosses and different handling techniques as well as start to introduce your dog to the equipment at a very very low level. Beginner classes usually assume some proficiency and it can get you started off on the wrong foot. Dont be put off if your pup is not the top of the class right away  Agility is all about having fun FIRST so make sure you make that a priority. It is normal for dogs to be a little afraid of the equipment at first and it can take some time to build strong reliable behaviors and learn the correct handling style for your dog to be successful. Some dogs are really sensitive to handler proximity for example  others are EXTREMELY gesture sensitive. Our corgi is a gesture sensitive dog and if my body or hand is a little off point he can get going in the wrong direction really easily.

She rolled it once before I got her.  Then she played about another hour ignoring the puppy.  She played with a pitty puppy the same age just fine.

2049828,0,t1_cl01vyn,It would more accurately be like taking an alcoholic into the bar and taking away the booze when he becomes belligerent and starts pummeling a toddler. Trying to offer advice to someone seeking it. The dog park doesnt have to be off limits to keep everyone safe and happy a little effort just needs to be made. Yes a dog put on leash at the dog park will become tense and start resisting because it wants to play. Dont let that happen. If you put her on leash and walk briskly around with her pausing every so often to ask for a sit and rewarding her with a treat or petting if that is a motivating reward for her she wont be focused on the fact that she is on leash. She will be paying attention to you and getting rewarded for it. I work at a dog daycare surrounded by about    dogs at a time. When one dog gets hyper focused on another this is what we do. If we just threw a leash on them and stopped them from playing and made them watch all the other dogs having fun yes they would get frustrated. We take their mind of what they are doing and make them pay attention to us. Its not punishment its training. ,dogs,cl0dmff,1,t5_2qhhk

Whenever I see her doing it without having just defecated or if she starts lickingchewing at her rear I know its time to express them. Most dogs will express their anal glands themselves when they defecate but small breed and obese dogs and cats may need help. Some may need it done more frequently than others but I usually have to do my dogs every  months. My very thin german shepherd needs to have hers expressed but she had a prolapsed rectum as a puppy.

I have five at the moment  two seniors one  year old one  year old and one  year old.  We live in the country and our property is completely fenced.  Our house is basically set up so its comfortable for both them and us.  We dont have any children so that is not an issue.As for the pack makeup?  At the moment its a greyhound sadly only one at the moment  ... I would have more but hubs says I have to wait until theres more room at the inn.  Ive had three greys at a time and that was a really good number of greys living together a hound mutt a border collie and two American Indian Dogs.  They get along well together and they mostly have an us against the world! mentality.  That being said they do have the run of the property and have a lot of time to play with each other and run around and hunt critters and bond. There are minor squabbles and booboos but that will always happen no matter how many dogs you have.  We also run our younger dogs oval and straight racing the nonsighthounds are unofficial participants but hey ... no point in leaving them out of the fun since they love to chase the lure.  Something else that helps manage our pack is that my husband is home most of the time so there is always one of us around whether I am working or not.  We have found that its very important to keep certain things on a schedule.  Their regular turnouts if they arent out already meal times one on one time walks.,dogs,cla1nl9,3,t5_2qhhk

EVERY TIME I SEE A DOG I SHOULD FREAK OUT!!What my dog learned at dog class I get rewarded for listening to my owner no matter how many crazy rowdy dogs I see. I dont always get to play with every dog. Paying attention to my owner when other dogs are around is just as fun.I also had some really terrible dog park experiences including Puppies that didnt have all of their shots at the dog park unsupervised toddlers wandering around people forcing their dogs in the lake dogs pinning my dog to the ground or otherwise scaring him dog fights my dog was not involved thank god human shouting matches etc. I quit going.,dogs,cldeiw8,2,t5_2qhhk
2152771,0,t1_cld4zgh,I thought I was the only one reading this and struggling to understand it. Its the same in the UK as what you describe in Australia. I live in NZ now and most places you arent officially allowed your dog offleash though if your dog is well behaved it would be vanishingly rare to hear any complaint and its common to see dogs off leash in general parks but the specific areas you are allowed to excercise dogs offleash are almost always crossed by paths are not segregated from other areas and often used by other people recreationally too. The idea of not running in places like that to avoid attracting dogs attention seems bizarre to me my only experiences of things like that have been with bored farm dogs or were quickly followed by embarrassed owners admonishing their dog and making excuses for its behavior like hes not used to being off leash or hes still a puppy.gtno leashes no fetching balls no toysThat seems bizarre to me too and Id never heard of it before. If you have a dog youd rather keep on the leash you cant go there? Where are you supposed to play with your dog with a ball or frisbee private property? ,dogs,cldgs7q,4,t5_2qhhk

Max is  now and the illegals still give him a very wide berth. Hes an odd wolfdog though in that he loves everyone and is very cuddly. He does the wolf vocalization as he leans his massive self on peoples laps. He leaves the chickens and other dogs alone likes the kids and for the most part stays inside the fence even though the pasture fences provide easy escapes.

2173270,0,t1_clfy8jx,Breeds where the desirable treats demanded in the standard are inextricably linked with detrimental health traits are fairly rare. You could argue that English Bulldogs and SharPeis could be candidates but their problems are due to exaggerating certain traits and not the traits per se so the problem can  at least in theory  be addressed through selection away from those exaggerated types. In other cases where a trait is linked to a detrimental health effect Merle comes to mind problems are easily prevented by avoiding breeding Merle to Merle. The one other thing that comes to mind would be lethal brachyuria stump tails caused by the CG mutation. Not every stump tail is a lethal factor here is a list of breeds but some of them are such as e.g. in the Pembroke Welsh Corgi or the Australian Shepherd. Genetically speaking breeding two stumpy tailed dogs from breeds with this mutation together isnt much better than breeding two Merles together even though the deaths occur in utero.Edit One other thing that comes to mind is the ridge of fur on the back of Rhodesian and Thai Ridgebacks which is inextricably linked to a higher incidence of spina bifida and associated diseases.,dogs,clg2pam,4,t5_2qhhk

2186155,0,t3_2k437p,Please consider the flowchart that ucpersall has linked  breeding your dog is irresponsible in this situation. Being cute is not a valid reason to breed. Breeding should add to the overall wellbeing and benefit of the breed itself and so the first issue with this is that your dog is not an actual breed. There are many other issues with this situation but this first one alone gives you your answer as to whether she should breed at all let alone with this dog in particular. In terms of etiquette two owners who both have health tested dogs with proven training and skill through awards placing working trials whatever will meet each other and thoroughly discuss the health pros cons and lineage of their dogs. If they feel that the mating will benefit the lineage of both dogs and the breed as a whole then and only then will they consider breeding. It is pretty clear from your initial idea to just surreptitiously get your dog pregnant by theirs that you are not prepared for the realities of breeding. Please spay your dog she shouldnt be bred from.,dogs,clhpov3,3,t5_2qhhk

In that time weve had countless vets speculate on exotic problems our sick pet might have and in almost every instance a round of antibiotics cleared up the problem.I remember we had one kitten that went off her food the vet suggested a variety of expensive treatment options but in the end at my insistence we started with amoxicillin and the kitten was eating again within two days.

2228779,0,t3_2kmxgn,I never had a dog before my wife brought home a mo old pitpointer mix.   He was a very playful determined to please little guy and I was equally determined that he was going to be a good representative for pits.  So I hired a trainer that came highly recommended.  He really only had one destructive issue and that was chewing on a bit of trim in our house that stuck out.  I asked the trainer what to do about it and she said I had to set him up so I could catch him in the act and scold him.  The next day I put his favorite toy right next to the trim.  Sure enough he went from chewing his toy to chewing the trim.  I shouted NO in the harshest tone I could muster as I walked over and stood over him.  Repeating NO.  He immediately stopped and went and laid down in his crate.  I felt horrible but also like I had no choice.  Not long after that we started doing some agility training with a trainer that helped us achieve remarkable things to me with only positive reinforcement.  I realized that I did have a choice.  Since then my wife and I have overcome any of his negative tendencies using only positive techniques we are fortunate that he is very food and play motivated.  I have read a ton of dog behavior books since then and weve engaged in all different types of dog sports together and worked with many different trainers never that first one again.  Hes a great dog and weve had the greatest times together.  To this day Ive never repaired or repainted that chewed bit of trim...and to this day Cooper has never even walked near it.

Do you have buyers lined up already? If you had a litter of  pups youd have homes for them before theyre born? Whats the draw for these mixed breed puppies that someone would want as opposed to just a dutch shepherd or german shepherd which a person could get instead and know exactly what theyre getting? What is the goal of breeding this litter what would they be exceptionally good at that? What kind of home would you be looking to place them in? Honestly I just dont see the point. Just because you have two great dogs doesnt mean theyll have puppies that anyone other than you would want.Check out these posts Should You Breed Your Dog?

Id start getting him used to going in his crate and be patient with him...as long as hes not hurting himself or destroying the house it might not even be that bad. When I first got my pup he would cry like he was being stabbed when I left. He figured out over the course of a few months that I always come back eventually and that yelling does not magically make me reappear. Remember hes a rescue hes not clean slate puppy from a breeder.

Furthermore A petnonpet flight would not mean one flight is only dog owners and the other is only nondog owners. It would mean one service would allow bringing dogs while the other wouldnt.

It is important to me to support a caring responsible breeder.I have no interest in showing or breeding and am very clear about this with the breeder. The most important things for me are temperament and character and if I have a dog whose tail curls too much for breed standards thats fine by me  which it clearly wont be for a person with different priorities. It makes sense to me that the person who does want to showbreed their dog get the pick of the litter in this respect.Im not sure from what your write whether you actually do want to show your dog and pursue that as an interest or whether you think it is something you have to do if you get a pup from a reputable breeder. If you are interested in showing I suggest you start attending shows and meeting people make connections ask questions.

Dogs that have never seen a bike will bark at it same goes for a person in a wheelchair a child a black person whatever. It would be easier to allow him to bark a few times and then be quieted. Ive taught my dog that a few seconds of barking is okay then she has to go sit in the bedroom and be quiet while I answer the door. I would suggest hiring a trainer to help manage his behavior in the house. This was what helped me learn what to do and made me feel confident I could manage her protective behavior. I would also suggest not allowing him to meet people at the door. Let the person come in sit down avoid paying the dog any attention and then let him out on leash so you have control over whether he can get up in their space and bark or not.Until you get a trainer try to limit the number of incidents. If he sees something across the street and starts barking close the blinds take him to another room redirect him limit his ability to hearsee the offending person. ,dogs,cmbafce,7,t5_2qhhk

2435801,0,t1_cmcmu62,The BCs in my area for agility can easily hit    and  classes. I think it is weird to see a  BC but I know some people are trying to breed them small to dominate the  class. Its a really weird range that doesnt make sense to me. I know the BC standard is basically any dog who can work stock in the style specific to the breed regardless of size color coat shape. But imo theres a sweet spot for size in herding thats around  this wide  range is overshooting that sweet spot on both ends. I completely respect the ABCAs stance which is why I went elsewhere. The Belgian clubs are all about the all around dog so I felt that was an awesome choice since at the time I wanted to do everything under the sun. Now I just want to herd haha. However while I get that the ABCA doesnt want showing it is disheartening that theyll deregister a dog if it gets a CH. Theres a judge trainer and clinician whose daughter showed a few of his legit working BCs in Juniors and conformation prior to the deregistering and they finished. It sucks that his dogs would be outted along with offspring due to the whole we dont accepted AKC dogs  I think that if someone wants to spend the time and money show people what a BC SHOULD look like that is preferable to allowing people to think they are supposed to look like big balls of fluff. But hey its not my circus and not my monkey so the ABCA can do as it wants! Honestly Id pay good money for a front row seat at the National BCSA show if all these big hats showed up in boots to show their Open trial dogs in conformation.

2449205,0,t3_2nkmhd,Puppies are a pain in the arse but if youre around all day its definitely doable there is something awesome about raising a puppy although then you are to blame for most of its faults! I recommend you visit a couple of shelters and see what you think of the dogs talk to the shelter staff about what the dogs would need in terms of care and exercise and mull it over. If you decide to get a puppy please come back and post for advice on how to choose a good breeder there are plenty of people who can help.Two  minute walks a day is great for most companion breeds  thats what my puppy gets and its more than enough for him although when we offer him more he welcomes it with open arms. Working breeds need more exercise. If you have patience and are willing to provide the mental stimulation it would need have you thought about a miniature poodle? a miniature isnt the smallest size  think knee high rather than a handbag dog. They do require grooming  a once over with a brush every day and a trip to the groomer every ish weeks.For meet and greets in a shelter you want a dog thats happy to see you but not outofcontrol happy receptive to being pet bright and alert. Ask the staff who deal with them every day about their temperaments. For puppies from a breeder there are a whole host of things you should  be looking at and asking about  the temperaments of the parents health tests what they do with their dogs if theyre breeding dogs by choice they should be doing stuff to show their dogs are worth breeding  e.g. agility showing hunting trials. A good breeder will probably have a waiting list so this is something to bear in mind if you hope to get a dog sooner rather than later. Please please post again if you have questions its better to be as informed as possible!,dogs,cmefbv4,4,t5_2qhhk
2449351,0,t1_cme6kbi,There are poorly bred purebreds... But there are also many well bred purebreds. Ive seen more problems with labradoodles than I have standard Poodles and I know more standard poodles. Ive also never seen genetic problems with cardigan corgis and I know quite a few including a few of the top show dogs in the US.  I live near a very well respected Cairn Terrier breeder and a Portuguese Water Dog breeder that have never seen genetic issues pop up in a puppy. You can breed purebreds right. Just because some breeds werentarent doesnt mean all purebreds are bred poorly. Also these breeders I know do a lot of work with rescues. Typically when they have a litter and are interviewing you to see which puppy from the litter might suite you best or if this is even the right breed for you they will also see if you are a fit for any foster dogs they have or any rescues at a local breedspecific rescue. A few actually count as prescreening for a rescue and the others will help you fill out the rescues paperwork. At a local dog show a number of breeds had information on rescues for their breed for people who came to the show to breed shop. ,dogs,cmefz7n,5,t5_2qhhk

2462768,0,t3_2nqk8n,I know your pain. I use Ruffwears Singletrack model with our dogs and have found that there are  tricks to keeping them balanced What you and I think of balance works on a macro scale but these packs balance on a micro scale. A difference of just one ounce is enough to tilt them over time. For this reason I keep some small and light objects in one of the dogs packs that can be distributed as needed small first aid kit plastic sunglasses in a fabric sleeve travel Kleenex package. Keeping the pack fit snuggly helps. Certainly dont make the harnesses tight but if you can easily fit a finger under the front one then it is to loose. Even with a well balanced and well fitting setup the dog can still make the pack fall to one side when they rub on trees and underbrush or roll. Between our two dogs I have to adjust a backpacks position by hand roughly every half mile when we are near landscaping or are in a forest.,dogs,cmg3kny,3,t5_2qhhk

2513117,0,t1_cmmjmtw,There is a good reason that parents hold their childrens hands a lot especially in public. A human leash if you will. Also kids can talk. And are smart. And much more communicable. When there is something wrong they will be able to explicitly tell you what it is how theyre feeling. As much as you might think you can read dog body language it isnt nearly as accurate nor informative as human spoken language. In addition dogs are already armed with builtin weapons  teeth claws muscle.... much more risk involved than a kid. Dogs are animals not people. It doesnt even make sense to compare them.Not asking for the dog to not go in public your analogy is troubling... black people  dogs?. Simply asking to have an extra security measure to let such fearful people rest easy and to actually be able to protect them in case of an accident. I feel as though you speak of a leash as some sort of torture device. Im not sure what the big deal is because there is so little effort involved in using one. There is an obvious benefit to it that it seems you dont want to admit... because... I dont even know. Because you are overly prideful of your dog. I highly doubt you can convince anybody that having a dog on a leash provides absolutely zero benefits. Fear isnt always irrational. People dont know your dog  they have a right to be cautious or wary when its loose running around. Dogs have quicker reaction times than we do run faster and can bite the hell out of people or animals. If shit went down it would go down hard. Even if most dogs are not aggressive of course people are going to be watchful of a dog that has free reign of the entire area.,dogs,cmmlpse,4,t5_2qhhk

2527658,0,t3_2ojktv,My opinions. It definitely sounds like typical playfighting. It is my opinion that you shouldnt ever let her snap even playfully since you should make it clear that is not ok with humans to prevent accidents. I wrestle with my two pits but frequently will tell them to calmsit if they get too rowdy it should be clear that you are in control of the situation so you can both have fun together. . Some dogs are uncomfortable with cuddling like that as it makes them feel anxious. She wants to be close just not that close. Let her choose the distance so she can be comfortable and she will gradually trust more. She could also have been trained or chastised about being too close by the previous owner. They form habits and pick up on routine very quickly which is how she knows it is bed time when you turn off the TV without saying anything. She knows what to expect out of the routine.. She likes belly rubs more maybe? Seeing as how she also behaves like in  it probably makes her anxious for you to be near her facethroat or it could be the past owner had a kid that grabbed her ears too hard and she is worried about it.. Depends if she wags her tail its pretty clear usually. The sound is pretty important as it could just be a happy grumble. If she is showing teeth or curling her lip it can be taken as a nonagressive warning. Not really that she doesnt like it but could be she is uncomfortable or anxious.. Who really knows other than her? . Dogs are social creatures if you are in the packfamilyunit she depends on you and is comforted by your presence. Isnt that love?,dogs,cmoi2cm,3,t5_2qhhk

2529902,0,t3_2omgbz,Like others said your dog was raising its hackles out of some sort of excitement. You have to look at the rest of her body language to determine if it was fear aggression or happy excitement. My dog took several trips to the dog park before he was completely relaxed. He would run from bench to bench and hide underneath. You can help by being a calming presence and praising good behavior. For example when she plays well with another dog encourage her. Move her away from potentially bad situations and dogs that she does not seem to get along with. Keep in mind that when problems occur it isnt always because one dog is bad but rather because two dogs personalities dont mesh well.

Breeds are very handler specific and each handler or team has their own strong opinions of which breeds are best suited for the job.Personally I wanted a dog who I did not have to teach how to hunt use his nose and one with a high retrieving instinct so the reward play would be easy to target. I like how hunting dogs like pointers labs retreivers work in the field they normally have a good working distances away from their handlers.  They have an instinctual search pattern called quartering they use to find birds.  Their hunt drive is strong and they dont get frustrated or give up easily. . How did you get involved with search and rescue and what are some of your most memorable experiences?My work crew wanted to get started so we went through the training process and  years later I still love itMost memorable experience would just be some of the amazing places I get to go last fall we snowshoed  miles on the Pacific Crest Trail looking for a hunter.  Second best would be climbing halfway up a mountain one day to a  mile total then going out the next day hiking  miles up a daisy trail to find our missing. . Do you do this professionally and are you able to support yourself with this kind of work? How often do you get asked to participate in a search and rescue mission? Do you work with local police department private company or military service?No I do this on a volunteer basis I spend as much money on gas equipment and training that people do on any hardcore hobby.  Our missions are rather sparodic on when they happen or how often we get called out.  In hunting season we know we will be busy after the first snow melt we will be busy if the snow is really good the snowmobile team might get more missions then any other team.

2637728,0,t3_2q4umv,The following update was posted on the Penn Vet Facebook page back in October possibly on other sites as well but I saw it on my news feed and thought you all might like to see. So many of us have lost our beloved pets to osteosarcoma a cruel fate to watch ones dog undergo.gt It is now over  months since the first dog diagnosed with spontaneous osteosarcoma received an experimental bone cancer vaccine at the University of Pennsylvanias School of Veterinary Medicine. The vaccine is being administered to pet dogs that have been diagnosed with osteosarcoma an aggressive tumor that affects the long bones of large and giant breed dogs. With current standard of care that consists of amputation and follow up chemotherapy median survival times are between  and  days. The aim of the vaccine given to dogs after amputation and chemotherapy is to prevent metastatic disease and prolong overall survival. Of the first  dogs vaccinated in this clinical trial  of the dogs are still alive and have survived between  and  days three of these dogs are tumor free. Other dogs have been vaccinated more recently so long term survival data for these dogs is not yet available. These results are really very exciting Dr. Nicola Mason the lead investigator on the trial explains. They suggest that the vaccine is able to stimulate an effective antitumor immune response that is able to kill microscopic metastatic cells and prevent tumor recurrence in these dogs. Importantly the vaccine appears to be safe. Only lowgrade toxicities consisting of a mild fever and occasionally one episode of vomiting the same day as vaccination have been reported. There have been no long or shortterm complications observed with the vaccine. The results are highly promising and a larger phase II clinical trial is now being planned at Penn and at collaborating sites including Colorado State University and the University of Florida. ,dogs,cn2vtrp,2,t5_2qhhk

2667536,0,t1_cn6r93c,I absolutely agree. I posted a thread similar to this one once and got similar responses. The one that stuck with me is how we define punishment. How can you know what the dog finds uncomfortable? Are there dogs out there that have such a high drive and motivation to get at a certain object that prong collars are mere annoyances and therefore arent really punishment? Surely there are some dogs that shut down at just the weight of the head halter on their nose. Hell pulling on a flat collar could be considered positive punishment if the dog finds it uncomfortable enough. I honestly dont have a good solution or answer. Each dog should be judged on an individual basis. My dog doesnt exhibit any uncomfortable body language on his gentle leader no more than when on a martingale. If OPs dog finds the gentle leader to be particularly aversive and they dont want to go that route with their training then by all means dont use it. But if the dog responds well to it as a training aid then I dont see anything wrong with it. ,dogs,cn6rsaa,7,t5_2qhhk
2669114,0,t3_2qk3on,I have field tested extensively with GSPs and and my dad is a judge... but Im in Canada so I cant speak to the American system. As far as training in Canada the junior title called Field Dog Junior does not typically require a lot of training. You will of course want your dog to have encountered birds before and slowly expose him to gun fire but only starter pistols are used at this level there is no retrieve component and the dog really only needs to flash a point. Depending on the judge he may lose a certain number of points for only holding the point for a few seconds but it would still be a pass. So a reasonably birdy pup that has been exposed to birds and has confidence in the field should pass.  months may be a bit young since some dogs dont have enough confidence to work the field at a suitable pace and dont range out very far and if the dog doesnt work well youll have a hard time passing even if he does point. So the most important thing is really bird exposure. Getting him interested and experienced enough so that he knows when hes taken out to the field hes there to find birds. If he has natural instinct he will WANT to run hard and really work the field once he learns that there may be birds out there.To proceed further with your hunting titles you will need extensive training. Steadiness to wing and shot a clean enough retrieve on land and from water to score highly and backing the brace mate typically do not come as easily as the initial instinct. As far as setters specifically... I have seen them fair well in tests and trials. But where Im from Brittanies and GSPs dominate the testingtrialing world and really seem to perform the best at it. I wonder if this is the result of judges expecting setters to perform the same way that Brittannies and GSPs do though. I assume their style of hunting this is an actual category that is scored in Canadian tests would naturally differ.Let me know if you have any other questions  ,dogs,cn6z6pc,5,t5_2qhhk

If youre going to introduce the dog to the cat have the cat in a room with the door shut and allow your dog to sniff safely. When hes had a few minutes to sniff then you can sit in the living room with your neighbors and have your dog ON A LEASH lying down. Keep treating the dog for a down stay. Have your neighbors let the cat out and allow the cat to approach on his own time. This will be a better way to see the cats reaction because he can smell that the dog is in the building.

Her dogs are pretty bomb proof but I think that might be the genes not the hanging bottles. She always had it in the yard not shoved in an xpen. The nice thing is that the puppies are in control of the movement. If the dog isnt comfortable it can escape the sounds or movements then explore later on when it is comfortable. When the vacuum goes on puppies dont really have a choice. You cope or crap your pants you know? I think theres value in the exploration.

The conditioner is probably going to be the most important part. If your dog isnt bothered by scented things you can never go wrong with an Oatmeal ShampooConditioner combo. Its very important when you are bathing a dog at home to make sure you rinse the dog thoroughly because leaving shampooconditioner on the skin can cause irritationflakiness.Brandwise Im a huge fan of Furminator products. My two dont shed and I still use their conditioner over anything else because its absolutely amazing. Burts Bees is another brand that I cant say anything but good reviews.

I dont have great advice  but sharing my story might help make you feel better  or at least help you figure things out.  I had a dog pass away very suddenly about  months ago.  I had adopted Lucy when she was a puppy  trained her  and took her everywhere with me.  Im not kidding.   I adopted her when I was   and as soon as she was potty trained  took her to parties  out to run errands  and vacations!  I always said I would die when she did because she was literally my best friend.  Well  I didnt.  But I wanted to.  That kind of bond doesnt happen overnight or even within a few months.  That kind of ownerdog relationship takes a long time.   So  dont beat yourself up about not having that right away.  I was having trouble coping  so I adopted another dog.  Tessa has separation anxiety  depression  she isnt toy or food motivated  and saying shes extremely dependent is an understatement.  After two weeks  I actually considered taking Tessa back to the shelter.  But  its obvious all she needs is love  attention  and a ton of reassurance these problems are temporary.  I love Tessa  but I wouldnt say its how I loved Lucy.  I dont particularly enjoy doing the things I have to do for Tessa like walks at am when its  outside  but I do enjoy how excited she gets when I get home from work. That makes it worth it. Maybe you wont ever feel the way about a dog like I felt about Lucy  and thats okay!  If you dont think you can  find someone who will. Yes  your dog deserved to be happy  but you do too.

2792525,0,t1_cnl2c69,Hi thanks for the response. I would like to get a dog now because I live in the suburbs and will continue to for the next year at least probably the next  months and would like my dog to be trained and familiar with me by the time I move to New York if thats what I do. If I dont move to New York I would either live in Chicago or Toronto which would be better for a dog because I would probably have more room but Im more interested in NYC. We have a fenced in yard at home and also have a lot of large fields near my parents house. My grandparents had two salukis when we were growing up so Im familiar with the breed. Ive also gone to a few coursing events and have talked to a breeder who is planning a litter actually about what it takes to own a saluki. I fostered one for a month around a year ago in a decently big city and she would get pretty nervous walking around the main streets but she was from the country and had never been in the city before so Im hoping a dog that would be introduced to a city and more people as a puppy would be better. She did well with other dogs but was given less attention by her owners who travelled a lot for coursing with their other dogs so I dont think she was very well socialized. She was a spayed feathered bitch so I know how long their tufts could get. Im unsure on what gender I want but Im leaning towards female because theyre smaller. All in all Im quite familiar with the breed. Im on the Saluki Club of America Breeder Referral Facebook page so Im up to date on current litters. I know that they could be shy and aloof but thats what I want in a dog because I dont want a dog that needs to be attached to me . I like greyhounds a lot as well but I love everything about salukis and have wanted to own one for years. Im not a really social person and would be more than happy staying in with my dog. The biggest problem will be dealing with where Im working when I move but Im planning on living with a couple of my friends who are okay with my having a dog and one of them will be in grad school and has a more flexible schedule. While Im obviously not going to rely on him at all for help with my dog it would be nice for the dog to have someone home while Im not.,dogs,cnlhzwn,2,t5_2qhhk

After that would be spitz breeds anything that drools and anything that sheds excessively.Its easier for me to tell you what I would own than what I wouldnt.

To keep it short and simple though the two I dislike most arent actual breeds though some knuckleheads would have you think otherwise  puggles and doodles of any kind but especially lab or golden ones.

I gave him chicken and rice and he puked it up so I gave him hrs of no food to give his tummy a rest. After that just chicken and rice for a few days and then slowly mixed his food into the rice to switch him back over. If hes acting like himself thats a good sign.But man if you notice anything out of the ordinary or hes still getting sick even after you withhold foodstart rice just take him in.

Edit You can also try working up to it. Get some little treats or break big ones up. Reward him every time he lets you hold him or grab his muzzle without struggling.

2855751,0,t1_cnsp1mw,Ugh I know people just dont get the llewellin distinction.  Its a separate LINE not breed.  The funny thing is almost every single field setter in the world has llewellin bred in somewhere because of how dominant they were in classical field trialing.  But not every setter is a line bred pure llewellin.  The differences are minor at best anyway and largely relate to physical size.  The only major hunting difference is the llewellins tendency to range close i.e. still far as fuck.  Temperamentally and desire to hunt there is little to no difference between any of the field setter lines.  Same goofy mischievous gentle setters! Like do I have color preferences?  Hell yea I prefer tri color setters I like their eyebrows!  But I am going to take the dog that best suits my needs since Id love and cherish the animal whether they were a white and orange or a black and white.  And if you are looking for a field bred dog and color is even MENTIONED by the breeder as a goal for the litter run away because they are either a puppy mill breeder trying to get wannabee hunters or they arent breeding good gundogs.  ,dogs,cnsp6ne,1,t5_2qhhk

A dog I was looking after didnt bother coming into the kitchen unless she thought people were going to be hanging out there for a while. My solution was to feed her around my breakfast and dinner times when the whole family was in the kitchen.If you think its because the living room has carpet you could try and put a small rug near her food bowlIn any case I think that if you want the dog to eat in the kitchen then dont feed her in the living room. Just put the food in the kitchen and make sure she knows its there i.e. call her over. If she doesnt eat it assuming you feed her twice a day Id say its alright for her to miss one meal. She might just not be hungry. Make sure you are not overfeeding dont forget to factor in any treats.If you get to the point where she hasnt eaten in over  hrs thats when Id start getting worried.Youve only had the dog two days so she probably doesnt know how to behave yet or when mealtimes are. Moving the food bowl from room to room might just make it more confusing for her. As for carrying the food into the living room maybe you could shut the living room door during meal times assuming there is a door to close...,dogs,cnsxlhk,2,t5_2qhhk

2888075,0,t3_2t70i8,Im sure youre wellaware but just because a dog is small doesnt mean it cant hike like a big dog!  I currently have a month old  lb terrier mix rescue that we adopted at  months with a Scottie build  those short stubby legs!  and a wirehaired Schnauzer face.  My boyfriend has only owned big energetic dogs boxer lab giant schnauzer rhodesian he loved to take out for hikes and when we found out our dog has excellent offleash recall we started taking her out with no worries at  months.  Shes ridiculously agile and could go without slowing down  while we physically hike  miles with our dog we also take her to the dog park  times on the same day theres one where we hike we hit it before and after and also one along the way home and play fetch with her on the easier parts of the hike.  When we know were going to be out and hiking for awhile we feed her an extra meals worth of kibble approximately a  increase in calories bring a ton of extra water and have plenty of treats on trail.  Dog booties are great too for extended hikes but just like with rain or snow boots get your dog used to it well before you use it if you intend on having them around.Were planning on going to Acadia next summer hopefully to camp for a few days and we hike any weekend its not icy or too cold.  Our dog tires less quickly with every hike and I think we can get her endurance up by next summer to be able to do an overnight.  Some pet product manufacturers also make dog carrier backpacks as well just in case which is a nice thing to have just in case she wears out and needs a nap.

Make sure youre incorporating obedience training in your routine possibly through puppy training classes if youre new to training. There are loads and loads of books devoted to dog care so maybe buy or check out a couple from the library. Look into proper diets and decide whats best for your dog. From home cooked food to store bought there are a lot of options but the cheap stuff from Walmart or wherever isnt a good choice. Make sure your dog is vaccinated at the scheduled times and develope a good relationship with a vet you trust remember theyre providing you with a service and dont hesitate to find a new one if you dislike their attitude suggestions or handling of your dog. And for the love of God if you have a question about your dogs health take it to the vet dont ask this sub to diagnose it. Good luck!

Teaching your dog to bypass distractions like other dogs will be key to getting the lunging and general reactivity down. A lot of it is getting your dog to focus on you with a look at me or watch me.

If youre knowledgeable about how to desensitize and countercondition maybe its worth it? Best case scenario you somehow eliminate all fear. It takes months and constant work but you succeed. Middling scenario you eliminate some fear but he always has some triggers that will cause him anxiety. Or he remains fearful but only shies away from things he dislikes rather than getting aggressive. Worse case scenario fear turns into aggression and he becomes difficult to live with or take anywhere.

Huskies are more independent and sometimes just wont do what you want because they dont feel like it rather than because they dont understand. Huskies are one of the more difficult breeds to own at least for most people. If you made a biddableness scale goldens would be near the top and huskies near the bottom.However goldens still need a lot of exercise and attention especially if you get a puppy or younger adult. Theyre not really the ideal single working persons dog. They are... lets just say enthusiastically athletic.Here are some questions that could help us determine if you should get a dog and if so what sort of dog would be best for you      Do you have other pets?     How much grooming do you want to do or how often can you pay a professional to groom him?     Whats your activity level?     How often will the dog be left alone and for how long?     If needed could you hire someone to walk your dog when you cant be home pay for a doggy daycare or come home at lunch to break up the day for him?     How trainable does your dog need to be?     How important is having your dog offleash?     Are there breed or size restrictions understanding that some breeds may make it more difficult to find housing?     Do you understand that dogs can live up to  years?     Do you have a fenced yard or is there a large fenced area nearby?     Do you have young i.e under  children or planning on having children?     Are you experienced with owningtraining dogs?     Where do you intend to keep your dog?     Whats the weather like where you live?     Did you budget for your new dog?     Where do you intend to get the dog from?

On average a puppydog will go through an initial freak out for about fifteen minutes however... lets say you crate the puppy and let himher cry for  minutes then go in and comfortlet them out... well... they will expect to cry for that long next time. For my girls I would have a plethora of treat value Kongs in the freezer. Water soaked frozen kibble plain yogurt cottage cheese honey peanuy butter etc. Giving the treats and shutting them in really quick they will begin to associate this as a trap and start to fear their crate. Leave the doors open and put a very very high value treat in the area. Dont make it a scary trick make it fun and yummy!If the crate size is too big that can also cause stress on the puppy. They need enough room to stand up and turn around comfortably... thats about it. They do need to relieve their bladders approximately every two hours as well.These are the most common things I see with puppy anxiety... fix them if its still continuing its a deeper issue which needs to be rectified so you dont have a miserable dogpuppy.,dogs,coh81x2,1,t5_2qhhk

3105310,0,t3_2voz46,This is a really awesome article. Im gonna bookmark it.This is essentially how my SO and I raised our dog.  We got her when she was  weeks old and she was not confident  she embarrassingly barked her head off when any dog came within  feet of her shed hide behind our legs when people came up to her she was afraid of water and rain the owl statue in the backyard the dark people with hats in the dark  pretty much everything.  I was scared because I thought my dog was broken and I was determined to fix it because we live in a city filled with dogs and people everywhere.  She was one of the most timid dogs I had ever met.We literally fell off the face of the planet for a solid  months socializing our puppy.  We paid for a dog walker  times a week and once every week or two our pup would get one on one socialization time with a dachshund her size in a controlled offleash environment.  Patio dining every night it was above  degrees into October.  Pet stores both big box and locally owned.  Walking through the city.  Pet Expo and dog friendly apple orchard at  weeks.  First dog park at  weeks.  First offleash hike with other dogs around at  weeks and almost every weekend thereafter.  Halloween parties  weeks.  She got  miles of activity a day broken up throughout the day and mixed between on and offleash romps and shes a dog park pro now.  She is trained to sit at our feet not jump on us if she doesnt like how a dog is behaving towards her and we call her our little tryhard because she wants to play with all the bigger dogs and sometimes they ignore her because of her size but she smartly positions herself off to the side so we dont have to worry about her getting hurt in a tussle!.  We researched fear periods and used a ton of positive reinforcement and conditioning to get her okay with everything.  Everything was gradual and we didnt overwhelm her in a situation that was too much for her.She isnt perfect and shes still very timid by nature but shes an incredibly wellbehaved dog with proper exercise and her confidence has skyrocketed.  Shes great with other dogs big and small fantastic with children loves cats loves people.  A lot of potential dog owners and nondog people dont truly understand how intensive it is and they see her and they think she just came that way.  In reality its absolutely the opposite.,dogs,cojv4c7,6,t5_2qhhk

Id suggest moving it to right by your bed  maybe even elevate it.  Basically put the crate as close to you as possible.  As your pup is evidently particularly distressed when away from you its going to be best to do this through desensitization opposed to flooding aka putting them in the crate walking away until they stop whining which works for some pups but it sounds like its not going so well with yours.So during the night you start your dog being incredibly close to you I started even putting my fingers in the crate and then gradually move your crate away.  So first the crate is elevated right next to your bed so your pup can see you no problem and hopefully will not whine or bark.  Then you gradually move the crate away.  First you no longer elevate then every night you move it like  inches away from your bed towards the bedroom door.  Then eventually  you move it out of your bedroom door and start to close the door at first just a little then more and more.I think gradual desensitization is the best bet for you.,dogs,con5ngc,8,t5_2qhhk

Every time they go for a drink of water they lap it up as if they are dying of thirst not caring how much air they are also taking in.gtPreventiongtGiving your pet smaller amounts of water to drink may help solve the problem. Another method to stop dog burping is to buy aslowfeed dog bowl so he will have to eat his kibble from around those knobs thus slowing down those eatfast instincts.

I know youre worried about all those nutrients but kibble does not provide a majority of that stuff. Kibble provides the basics. They barely provide enough meat to sustain the dog. I still give the dogs half the kibble so if there is something in the kibble Im not giving them they can eat more kibble.

For the time being I would recommend crating him every time you can not watch him. In order to correct the potty accidents you need to start from the beginning by not allowing him to have accidents. If you can really clean the urine smell off the wallsfurniturecarpetetc where he has gone.To train using the bell you can thumb tack a piece of string with a bell on the end next to the door that you intend him to go out of. Its much cheaper to make it yourself than to buy at the pet store Make sure the bell is low enough for him to reach with his nose or paw.  Every time you take him out to potty only take his paw or nose if he allows it and bump the bell. Also for the time being you can buy a belly band from the pet store to help you when hes inside.

You are lucky to have dog hair in your bedon your clothesin your food and following you on vacation. Your roommates might not like your dog. Your roommates can never be counted on to take care of your dog. Vets are an expensive and necessary requirement. Your dog doesnt care what the weather is like when its time to go out. The best dog in the world will fart sneeze drool and chew something you really like. All that being said they are wonderful creatures whose loyalty no human is deserving of. If youre OK with unconditional love then find yourself a little buddy. Think about an older dog in your situation. Be wary of dogs in the paper or craigslist. Look to reputable rescuesadoptions. Try not to fall in love with the first dog you meet its hard not to but rather find the dog that fits you. Its a lifelong commitment taking a dog so think and choose wisely while remembering your life will change and the dog will be a part of that.

Accidents happen though and this kind of injury is possible in any setting where dogs play together including at a dog park under your supervision.

You will also need to have your dog evaluated because dogs without solid nerves cannot do this kind of work. Finally protection training is pretty useless without bomb proof obedience so I would start there. Protection dogs cost thousands of dollars. This is a dangerous plan if you dont have the right dog and the right people to train you.Teaching them to attack isnt the hard part. Its teaching them to let go thats hard.I am getting a puppy soon who has these sorts of hard solid civil dogs in his background. I am not training him in bite work because I do not want him to choose to bite in a moment of excitement when we are doing search training. Biting is extremely rewarding for them so if you arent watching their triggers they are like a loaded gun that could go off at any point. I might teach him a bark at subject since for most people having an  lb German Shepherd barking at them is more than enough to scare them off. But why would I want to make a dog into a liability?

The dog needs to be able to listen to you in your house with nothing going on very low distraction consistently before you can expect them to listen in a high distraction area.  Have to taken her to a training class yet?  If not please do.  They last usually  classes one classweek and will prepare you for training your dog and a life together.  After the class and maybe some question from a trainer it might be easier to find out if you can raise the dog or not.But the big thing is that you cant expect amazing results without putting in an amazing effort.  Its not hard but it requires time and patience.  Also consider that its the first four days with you in a new environment with a new owner home etc.  Some time to adjust will help as well.

3361944,0,t1_cpbdshu,My dog showed no signs of a problem. Vets cleared him multiple times before his diagnosis. I agree sometimes a  dollar surgery is inevitable and people should be prepared to pay that. But its really a situation by situation basis and this blanket judgement isnt fair. Not everyone is perfect and sometimes we have to make decisions that suck. Im sorry your dog is suffering but to blame and shame his old owners because they handled it poorly just isnt fair. Many many people have been rude and nasty about the decisions I made. Now Im confident I did everything I could have done to make the right decision but its scary and oftentimes injuries seem less severe than they are. Most of the times a dogs injuries are very minor. Leaving an injury for a few days to see how it heals isnt that negligent. Deciding to give up your dog because he has a few surgeries in his future isnt an awful thing. I just think youre upset that your dog is suffering and taking it out at his previous owners and although we treat our dogs as family to shame people who took a dog in and cared for it well albeit not the way that most of us would is unfair. ,dogs,cpbhj2u,5,t5_2qhhk

3400070,0,t1_cpfray7,Right? And this same list was on many many rental community sites. Many didnt have a weight limit also they dont ban other large breeds like Newfoundlands Bernese Weimaraners etc.It probably has to do with insuranceliability. I know that many homeowners insurances wont insure households with those listed breeds. Some counties ! in the US ban breeds.I believe that the aggressive list is based on bite reports. I mean no one is going to file a police report if a yorkie bit them. I can imagine that significant wounds would mostly come from large scary breeds. Huskies and Mals look like wolves...I get it. But to me a bite is a bite Yorkie or Doberman. Same risk of rabies if that dog isnt vaccinated and what about infection? So the data is skewed.Still I kind of get it. How are landlords supposed to distinguish aggressive from nonaggressive? The ignorance lies in the fact that statistically the highest percentage of bites and fights come from unneutered dogs.

I told him I do clean up after my dog waving the bag in my hand around as I said it and that he shouldnt blindly yell at people who are walking their dogs because he assumes they made the mess in his yard. He went on about all the little piles of shit everywhere and that I was a piece of shit myself for even arguing about the hygienics of it all. I pointed to my dog then still a puppy at around  pounds  months and told him theres nothing small about her poops. He became more angry and I walked away.A week later there are three bags on the roof of my car. All three were regularsized plastic bags and all three contained a mixture of rabbit poop and what I assume is from either a small dog or a cat. I took each bag and grabbed  bags of my dogs poop and from the trash and walked to his house and explained what was and was not from my dog. He absolutely lost his mind and began shrieking at me about how I was a disgusting person for handling feces as he did over the course of a week and how I was insane to bring it to someone elses house just to prove a point as he did. I calmly told him that if he ever did it again Id call the cops and he could explain to them why he put bags of rabbit poop onto my car.

That doesnt mean you shouldnt get a dog though! Here are a few options Come home at lunch to let your dog out and play with him or her. Pay a responsible person from your neighborhood to take your dog out in the afternoon. This could be a high school student a stayathome mom whose kids are in school and who has a little free time at some point in the day a retired person etc. Pay for a dog walking service to come to your house and walk your dog. The most expensive option but a great idea for some take your dog to dog daycare every weekday.

Especially not from a rescue thats completely typical and the dogs end up being perfectly fine. Ok so you know these puppies are going to grow up to be relatively high energy as both labs and shepherds require quite a bit of exercise. Do you have  hours every day to devote to their mental and physical health? What about money? Raising a dog from a puppy is really freaking expensive. Your limiting factor for how long your puppy can stay home by itself is going to be how often it needs to go outside to go to the bathroom. The general rule of thumb is that the puppy can hold it for about an hour per month of age. If you get the puppy at  weeks old you can expect it to need to go outside every  hours. This includes at night btw. They may be able to hold it closer to  hours while sleeping but just go ahead and assume youll have to wake up once or twice in the middle of the night to let the puppy go pee. ,dogs,cpt8bzs,2,t5_2qhhk

3548213,0,t3_30wvy6,I dont know if this will be relevant to your situation but fwiw heres my experience. In  my then year old Shih Tzu had what I can only describe as a nervous break down. He exhibited many of the symptoms youve described for your dog. I was always home throughout the day with him and it broke my heart to watch my formally happy dog sitting and shivering in fear all the time. This went on for months.Right away I took the dog to my vet and over several visits he tried different medications. Nothing worked the meds just made the little guy lethargic with no appetite.Finally the vet said he doesnt usually recommend this because its such an added commitment but maybe I should consider getting a companion dog for him. Ill spare you the details of my researching and selecting a candidate dog but I finally picked out a rescue dog to bring home on a trial basis a  year old border terrierchihuahua mix.The instant I brought the new dog in the house to meet him my dog was cured. They are absolutely the best friends and there has never been another incident since the moment they met. My Shih Tzu just celebrated his th birthday and hes still his old happy loving self again. The new dog worships him. They are both laying by my feet as Im typing this.I know I got lucky. The vet was right there were so many potential pitfalls in taking his suggestion but I won the doggy lottery. I love both these dogs and Im so happy that my Shih Tzu is enjoying his golden years without the unreasonable terror he suffered.EDIT Added a repost story and video about the new guy.  ,dogs,cpwpw63,16,t5_2qhhk

3599322,0,t3_31ky4r,I dont think its anti pitbull to recognize the hard facts about the breed and the great responsibility that comes with owning one.  APBTs are genetically predisposed to dog aggression and have higher levels of prey drive.  They were originally bred for pit dog fighting and those drives that proved so successful in the pit are still evident in many dogs today.  Combine that genetic predisposition with sheer athleticism and the gameness and tenacity of a terrier and you have a dog that although I wouldnt say is inherently dangerous is sure as hell more capable of being violently dangerous than most other dog breeds.Pibble owners who spout off nanny dog nonsense and heshe would never hurt anything... until it actually does and usually with incredible violence are doing such a disservice to such an incredible breed when they disregard the true history of the breed and what it continues to be capable of today.  I dont believe you can be a good APBT owner until you truly understand what your breed of dog is what its capable of doing and the great responsibility that comes with managing that.I dont take my dogs into dog parks if I see an APBT and I dont believe that most adult APBTs should be in dog parks in the first place.  Even if it wasnt the APBT that started the fight you can sure as hell bet that its going to be the APBT that finishes it and gets all the blame for it.,dogs,cq2jrjh,3,t5_2qhhk

He also loves giving the paw so he sort of waves his leg vaguely at people until they catch it for him.  Unfortunately as he is a giant it exacerbates existing dysplasia but the hydro has really helped with that too. He definitely has some discomfort in the leg as he licks at it a lot if his antiinflammatory dosage is dropped.

3715315,0,t3_32y9c8,gtThe dog jumps all over me. Shes got tiny springs for legs and shes always leaping up at me. It gets kind of frustrating when Im trying to eat or go from point A to point B. What should I do? Ignore the poodle and keep walking even though shes leaping everywhere?Yup ignoring her is your best option here. Dogs usually jump on people when they want attention. You need to teach her that jumping doesnt get her attention. Turning your back on her when she jumps can help as well. Wait until she sits then give her lots of praise and attention.gtGiven her background the dog is also quite anxious. Frustratingly so. My fiance is a data analyst and she works from the home so the dog is her constant companion thats basically why she adopted her in the first place. She takes great care of her but when my fiance leaves the house the dog gets exceedingly anxious and starts whining and barking. God forbid she puts the dog in her crate beforehand. I feel bad for the worried dog but holy crap can it get annoying after minute . How do I deal with this? Sounds like moderate separation anxiety. There are some training exercises you can do to help but if neither of you have experience dealing with separation anxiety it may be worthwhile to consult a behaviorist.gtIm a god awful runner but I kind of want to take the dog for a small bike ride around the block since she has so much energy and hops all around so much. Would going around the block once or twice in low gear be a good way to exercise the dog? I dont want to wear her out or cause undue stress to her body. Is there a precaution or something I should do beforehand? Is morning better than night? Show her the bike first or try to ride along my fiance when shes walking the dog? Im terrified of running her over or wrenching her on accident since the dog is ALL OVER THE PLACE when we go for walks. Since summer is right around the corner I know heat is an important factor as well.I think it would be a good idea to get her walking on leash better before you start trying to bike with her. Biking can be a great way to give dogs exercise but they need to have some fairly solid looseleash walking skills first. Once you get that under control I would look into getting an attachment for your bike that hold onto the leash for you. There are a few on the market and I know there are some people on this sub that use them. One of them may be able to give you a recommendation.gtSharing a bed with the dog is tricky for me. We have a small bed which will be changing soon I hope and the dog goes all over the place. I am an absolutely horrible sleeper and the puppy wakes me up a lot. Are there any solutions? Ive been sleeping in the other bedroom and that has been a fine bandaid but its not a permanent fix. My fiance is training the dog to sleep on legs instead of heads so Im hoping that will be enough. Does the dog have to sleep on the bed?  I know a lot of people like to let their dogs on the bed but if its interrupting your sleep so badly that you have to go somewhere else I think you guys should consider different sleeping arrangements for the dog.gtThanks for listening. I dont really mind the dog but she has those few quirks that drive me up the wall. Does anyone have any advice or resources they can suggest?rdogtraining has some great resources in their sidebar. You might want to look at rpuppy as well even though shes not a puppy. If youre more interested in understanding your dogs behavior there are some great books out there.

3763144,0,t3_33h7mg,Im sorry to hear your dog is having so many grand mals I know how stressful and awful it can be seeing your dog going through them. My dog has had epilepsy since he was about  months old hes  and going strong now thankfully. His seizures are normally  mins and gran mals. Hes extremely disoriented afterwards and we keep him with us and dont leave him alone for the following day. During the time weve had scamp weve had  dogs  still going strong and Id have to say that it will depend on the dog. The dog we had when scamp developed epilepsy was able to sense when he was about to have a seizure and while he got agitated he was very good and was protective of him. The other two are ver different. We have a girl and she freaks out when scamp seizes and either attacks him or hides. It really confuses her. The puppy we have seems to have learnt the same reaction from her. We had something that we could give to scamp rectally that worked very well and brought him out of his fits. He doesnt have many now only a few a year down from  a month. I hope my experience helps.

3764218,0,t3_33ior2,Seeing as though they still have their momma around you probably wont have to spend time with them . I fostered when I was in college and had  puppies at one point without their mom. Fun but so so much work.Id say your best bet is to keep them behind a gate. Preferably in a tiled room because that just makes cleaning a lot easier. Also if you dont already have some Natures Miracle is something youll want to have on you to clean up any accidents. Just keep an eye on your own dogs just to make sure they dont knock the gate down or anything. Its more convenient than a door because when you pass by you can just peek in. Id say at that age youll probably be spending more time cleaning up after them than anything else. Youll probably spend more time with the mom. Its also a pretty good idea to keep your two dogs away from the mom and her pups for a while.

PetPlan on the other hand has a yearly limit on how much theyll cover. For the same  a month my pup is covered up to  a year and I only pay  per incident. I chose the silver plan with a  coverage  meaning that if my dog breaks her leg and needs a  surgery Id pay   not covered plus the  deductible  so  in total. The deductible is counted after the .

Change to a food that doesnt include the proteinfat source in her current food and if that doesnt work change to another etc.  The third ingredient in the Prairie food is chicken meal so you have to really read the labels.  Edit So I would be looking for a food that does not contain bison lamb chicken beef venison or ocean fish.  That leaves... turkey kangaroo boar and some other unusual animal proteins.  Chicken and rice allowed my dog to get better but he was still allergic to chicken all the same.  Proteins change depending on how theyre cooked and its possible the boiled chicken was unoffensive but the raw chicken in my case was provocative.  Your dog could be cool with boiled chicken but the high heathigh pressure cooking environment changes it to a form that she reacts to.Edit some more  The sensitive tummy prescription diets are often chicken protein thats been broken into pieces so small that the body doesnt really recognize them as chicken anymore.,dogs,cqsnz5z,2,t5_2qhhk

3849966,0,t3_34j40v,Puppies have prey drive right away the type of target just changes as they get older and learn what is rewarding or not rewarding to chase. Prey drive is about attraction to moving things and desire to chase them rather than desire to hurt other animals. It is more important that the puppy has not developed the habit of chasinghurting other animals than the age of the puppy. If you can find a puppy that either has not been allowed to chase OR has already been socialized to cats you should be okay. Also avoid breeds that are known to chase and kill small animals such as sighthounds and huskies. Introducing a new puppy to your cat.It is important to keep in mind that cats can also hurt puppies and should have their claws trimmed. One thing I did not realize is that when left unsupervised cats will tease dogs mercilessly. This is just instinct they are trying to figure out whether or not they are safe. So you need to prevent tension between them by making sure they are in separate rooms when you cannot supervise. I also would recommend keeping the puppy tethered to you for the first two weeks at home to prevent chasing. You will know pretty quickly whether the puppy is serious about chasing the cat or just curious.,dogs,cqv4qc3,8,t5_2qhhk

3876740,0,t1_cqy4oez,Do not shave your dog. Chances are it has a double coat if any of those breeds are in the mix. Shaving a dog with an undercoat ruins the coat and can harm the dog ingrown hairs their natural fur never growing back the same etc.. A decent groomer wont even consider shaving a dog with an undercoat.Get an undercoat rake a slicker brush and a furminator and learn how to groom your dog. It sounds like a pain and it can take a while but once the dog gets used to it its a great bonding experience also a good thing to do while binging on netflix. If you dont want to do that or cant then call a good groomer and ask for a deshed package. They will wash the dog with a deshed shampoo and then blow dry them out.

If you want sugar thats fine but dont expect allergy relief from local honey.Additionally a runny nose is not a typical symptom of canine allergies as in humans dogs get itchy instead. Please see a vet.gtQ Can local honey help myallergies?   gtANo. The theory that taking in small amounts ofpollenby eating local honey to build up immunity is FALSE.    gtHeres why Its generally thepollen blowing in the wind released by nonflowering trees weeds and grasses that triggers springtimeallergies not the pollen in flowers carried by bees. So even local honey wont have much if any of the type of pollen setting off your allergies.What you can do is take regional or personally formulated allergen drops under the tongue called sublingual immunotherapy. One company that does this for allergy tested dogs is Heska Theres also noncustom vet formulas from RespitAnd for people theres Allergena available in many natural grocery stores.

Kong actually puts out a bunch of flavors of this kind of spraycheeseinacan dog treat that you can fill the Kong with like a custard my pup loves the hell out of that stuff and kind of ignores the Kong if its filled with little bitesized treats. Also I would put the dog in a cone until you get her to the vet and maybe for awhile afterward to see what she does. If she continues to try and bite herself even with a cone on she is probably itching uncontrollably or has some kind of neurological condition. If she turns to some other kind of destructive behavior she has too much pent up energy and for some reason has chosen selfmutilation as a primary outlet maybe for the same reason some humans do it the release of painrelated endorphins is somewhat addictive.

4052590,0,t3_36xm87,I would ask the same question I ask whenever people bring up alternative medicine what exactly do you mean by boost her nutrition? Firstly are you boosting to improve from a baseline or due to a perceived gap and if so how are you measuring either? What is the percentage change in nutrition which you would consider a viable improvement ? ? Does doubling dosage double the benefits or is it a natural log graph which incurs only marginal improvements beyond the standard dose? What does the boost actually entail? If the benefits alleged are better immune system more energy and better skin then youre probably being sold garbage. No limits totally subjective measurements of success no caps on maximum therapeutic dose  probably not helping at all.I can tell you how much calcium or Vitamin D is recommended based on peerreviewed studies and how much is too much. I cannot say the same for fish oil bee pollen or spirulina. Generally speaking the consensus on supplements for people too notwithstanding a select few under a specific set of circumstances is doesnt hurt but really doesnt do anything. Specific to your list though... Bee pollen may as well be snake oil in terms of benefits to humans and because of the lack of testing in dogs and the lack of regulation in the industry it can actually potentially do harm. I know humans who are allergic to bee stings have experienced adverse pollen reactions and I imagine it would be the same in dogs. Heres  an article with sources from the Canadian Medical Journal Association and the NCBI. The conclusion beinggt There is no current basis on which to recommend the use of bee pollen products. There is a basis for caution however.Dont feed your dog supplements unless a licensed vet recommends that you do so. Best case scenario youre wasting expensive products worst case scenario you could induce allergic symptoms.,dogs,cri865m,4,t5_2qhhk

Other ideas based on whats worked for my no accidents for several weeks now fingers crossed! puppy who is also a hound Take the puppy out frequently enough that shes unlikely to feel an urgent need to go to the bathroom in between times. For a dog like yours who seems eager and willing to go potty outside this seems like it can sometimes help with understanding that they should only go potty outside. If they only go in one spot if at all possible remove access to that spot or item. Enyzmatic cleaners are great but Im pretty convinced that they may not fully get rid of the smell for some dogs either that or what attracts the dog to that spot is something else like texture. At around .ish estimated months we noticed that our puppy only had accidents in one sole spot the bathroom rug.

4130069,0,t3_37yy08,So on paper the lifestyle is doable. However a lot of the success is going to be determined by your personal knowledge. Youre not in a rush which is a good thing. It gives you lots of time to learn and have experiences that will be beneficial. Kinda longish scenario.Lets say youre making lunch and your dog puts its feet up on the counter top. Some dogsbreeds would respond very reasonably to you mindlessly elbowing the dog Other breeds like Belgians would take this as a challenge to TRY HARDER!  Standing didnt work so what about standing while hopping? What about shoving a nose into your arm? What about bouncing up and down? Hey what about trying to jump with all s onto the counter?  This isnt some sort of Cesar Milan dog is trying to dominate you crap. Its a pushiness that herding breeds are known for. If plan A didnt work lets try plan B. They dont just give up and go lay down. Imagine what an awful farm dog youd have if the dog tried moving some sheep and the sheep stomped the ground at the dog so the dog went and laid over by the gate. That pushiness and assertiveness are temperament traits you have to really respect and acknowledge on a daytoday basis.So what do you do just let the dog eat your lunch? Of course not. You ask your dog to sit or lay down then reward that behavior. You teach a contradictory behavior you cant be on the counter if youre sitting  With a little repetition the dog understands that sitting at the counter is the right response and jumping up earns the dog nothing of value.  So you need to ask yourself do I want to react to every annoying behavior with teaching a contradictory behavior? Am I up for that challenge? Thats a question only YOU can answer. When youre walking down the street with your dog if your dog gets excited and starts wagging or barking at a dog across the street leash poppingcorrecting is going to escalate the situation. But wait it works for other dogs...??  Yes Belgians are not other dogs. If you start heckling them with corrections they get more excited. Now you COULD give a massive correction that would basically entail whipping the dog off of its feet to make it abundantly clear that excited barking or wagging is unacceptable... but shit do you really want to go there? Plus now what happens if your dog walks away thinking other dogspeople are sucky? Now you get to deal with fear reactivity. Ugh. You need to have the patience and knowledge on how to redirect your dog. How do you distract a curious dog without resorting to constantly correcting it?  Toys and food will be your friend. Do you want to spend time learning to use them? Thats a question for you and you alone.Many Belgian ownersbreeders are caught between two worlds where they are so used to handling the breed that they dont think it is difficult or where their dogs run their lives and they think owning a Belgian is too hard for normal people. The reality is somewhere in the middle. There are challenges that are not impossible but they ARE personal.If you get a dog before having children please socialize the shit out of your dog as a puppy. Take it to an elementary school during recess or before school so kids can say hello. Dont go after school because omg millions of children with no where to be!  You can also go to parks and whatnot. Get your puppy to love love love kids and be used to the awkwardness of young children. Its not a  guarantee youll end up with a dog who is good with kids but it puts you a lot further ahead in the game than if you DONT actively socialize with kids. ,dogs,crr1vdt,14,t5_2qhhk

This is an extremely difficult breed with a LOT of energy. They are really difficult dogs to train!My husband and I are very active people so we have no problem getting her the exercise she needs most days  those days we dont though oh boy! Huskies are amazing because they have really expressive personalities  my dog is seriously like a sassy  year old girl. She is dramatic. She is stubborn. If she doesnt want to listen she wont  and its not because she doesnt know better its because she doesnt care. Huskies dont want to please you they also arent super cuddly dogs they are super strong willed and independent. Theyre also smart and need mental stimulation  so aside from the  hours of exercise they need focused play time. My girl needs to be challenged or shell eat the couch! While huskies arent cuddlers they do demand a great deal of love and affection from you. My husky requires constant praise and LOTS of treats. They also have a pack mentality. This means they dont like to be left alone or ignored. Theyre very social and love to be with other dogs. While many of these traits make the breed appealing when you combine them all into  dog its a challenge. I would not trade my husky for the world  I love her so SO much! She is an amazing dog with a really great personality. But had I been in a different situation I dont know that I would have been able to handle her.... my husband and I had just moved across country so I wasnt working yet which meant I was able to devote  months to her  of the time and my husband was able to devote about  months time to her prior to the move  even though I work now she spends a minimal amount of time home alone because my husbands work schedule is flexible and he gets a long lunch break. It took a LOT of patience and I think we did a pretty good job of training her but she is still a handful and a half and I honestly think she is a more mild tempered husky than most!,dogs,crrn2zz,2,t5_2qhhk

4179188,0,t3_38es14,That sounds moderately terrifying.  Heres a few tidbits and a legal perspective from someone with a J.D. since I havent seen anyone talk about potential legal issues.This depends partly on your area but generally using a dog to intimidate a person off your property is considered legally the same as using a baseball bat in a threatening manner.  The dog is for most purposes considered your property or a weapon in cases of selfdefense.  If they guy was invading your homeproperty and refused to back out you didnt have a duty to retreat and using the dog in this manner especially if it didnt bite is probably not a reason for any legal action.  Theres some more useful resources out there and I cant actually give you real legal advice youre not my client etc but you and your dog are probably safe from any potential legal issues.Second...well it depends on how you feel.  One of the reasons we domesticated dogs is so they could protect us from harm.  Theyre particularly friendly wolves and they have big scary teeth and can ruin someones day.We like to think of dogs as people and Im not necessarily saying that they arent in a philosophical way but remember that they dont really have moral agency the way people do  he protected you because thats just what he does.  Dogs are BORN to protect their owners and pack and him doing that doesnt invalidate you as a responsible owner.I get the feeling you might be worried you damaged your dog or exposed it to violence in a way you shouldnt have.  You probably shouldnt be.  When I was a kid my dad had a big stupid chowchow who was my best friend.  Teddy was ENORMOUS but friendly and gentle.  One day I was playing in the back yard and the neighbors incredibly unfriendly dog got loose and attacked me in the backyard and bit me in the face  I had a half moon scar under one eye until my late teens.Teddy wiggled out of his collar to get out from the tether line he liked sunbathing with me but was a bit of a runner and then went full bore at the neighbors dog tackling it off of me and going from goofy playmate to terrifying protector in about two seconds flat.  This dog was one of those huge oversized goldens and Teddy bowled him over like he was made of styrofoam.  He savaged the other dog till it ran away howling and wouldnt let the neighbor near me till my dad came and made sure I was okay.He was never violent again never aggressive and never hurt a fly.  Never even barked at strangers.  We take care of our dogs and try to make sure they dont HAVE to protect us.  But when they do remember its in their nature.,dogs,crwmrpc,1,t5_2qhhk

4228631,0,t3_39by1d,I have two large dogs male and female that get along fabulously and really enjoy playing together they are very well matched for this.They are close and spend time together during the day but they are also apart a lot of the time. The Spanish Mastiff lives outside for the most part and is awake and active at night the Beauceron sleeps in the house at night and is inandout during the day depending on the weather. They play mostly in the morning and evening during the day they relax close to each other or apart.I got them both as puppies so except for a few months its always been the two of them though I did raise them separately  so your third question doesnt really apply. Previously I had an old dog when I got a new puppy and he did not spend less time with me.They are not allowed to play indoors they are calm in the house and Ive made it a point to get them used to playing outside on their own which they do to a degree though they play harder and longer when Im out there with them. Ive also made it a point for the velcro breed one to get used to not being by my side the whole time and feel happy about this.My first dog was very much an only dog and reacted very badly when I brought the new puppy home he refused to come into the house at first and did not eat for three days. However over the weeks and months he gradually warmed to the puppy and became fond and even protectively watchful over him which was lovely to observe. They did not play together we went out on walks together and the older one would watch from close by as the younger one played with me or other dogs. At home they would lie close to each other and invariably mirror each others positions which was very curious and sweet.I socialised all the puppies individually ditto their training and Ive made sure to have onetoone time with all of them to forge individual relationships with each.I feel there is an element of luck in having dogs that get along but theres also plenty that can be done to help that. The breeders of my second pup understood exactly what I was looking for in terms of temperament to get on well with my old dog also male we discussed the situation thoroughly and the choice of pup was perfect. With my present pups I limited structured and supervised their play assiduously for most of their first year. One of them displayed tendencies to resource guard when he was very little so I started working on that immediately and it never became a problem they happily share toys and can be fed bones and treats in beds side by side.I wish you all the best in in figuring out the best choice for your possibly growing! family.

We are fortunate because it has no fence and the people who frequent the park seem to have a lot of control over their dogs and are all pretty aware of appropriate dog park behavior.  The key is to start slow as others have mentioned.  Go at less busy times and keep the visits brief.  She will start to warm up but never leave her in a stressful situation.

This can be remedied by management as you are already doing by not giving him toys but you can also use a method called trading up. Where you swap the resource he wants to keep such as a ball for something he will want more like a bit of chicken. So he learns that giving up his thing  getting something better in return. Google it for a more in depth explanation.Kikopup on youtube should also be your next stop training in a solid leave in in addition to trading up is highly beneficial.

4282359,0,t3_3a104t,Do you have a Facebook?  If yes ask to join this group  They have a huge amount of resources dedicated to helping people teach their dogs to be massively athletic.  You will find that most of the dogs in the demo videos are Australian Shepherds and Border Collies but a lot of dogs can do these sorts of tricks.  Bully breeds have very durable faces and LOVE pleasing their owners and can get totally ripped and do impressive athletic stunts but they also are prone to dog aggression which is quite a shock for unprepared owners and can be extremely difficult to manage.  They dont learn quite as fast or as well as herding breeds but have a lot of instinct and drive that works to the trainers advantage.  A wellkept bully breed is damn impressive.  The dog in the video is some sort of bully breed mix.  Herding breeds are athletic agile very smart and love learning.  They are very active in both body and mind and usually need training in addition to physical activity every day.  Australian cattle dogs also know as heelers and ACDs are tough as nails very active enthusiastic and some of the most successful trick dogs. They have a tendency toward aggression as well especially when theyre chronically understimulated.  This is in contrast to Border Collies which become nervous anxious and neurotic when theyre understimulated. ,dogs,cs8ca7h,9,t5_2qhhk

4288233,0,t3_3a1v1a,gtSo today is day  of our  week old rough collie Henry being home with us. And everything has been going too well.Ive owned collies since  but of the smooth persuasion.  Ive had pups like this  very mellow low key at  weeks.  I think its a combination of the shock of being in a new place growth spurts and general personality.  Its always been the boy pups  I suspect they just dont mature as fast as the bitch pups mentally amp physically and it takes them a few weeks to get up to speed. See what you vet says.  gtIm aware Im just being paranoid. But seriously everyone I know has been telling me its going to be difficult getting a puppy.  Let me tell you a secret  Collies tend to be easy dogs.  Even as pups they are often easygoing and agreeable.  If you wanted a crazy naughty destructive puppy experience you probably got the wrong dog.  That said every one of my collies have destroyed one thing as they grew up.  Pablos one act of destruction was to pull out a single book from my bookshelf and chewed off the cover.  It was an early edition of Eric Knights Lassie Come Home in before Pablo got to it near mint condition.  I suspect he couldnt take the stress that I would someday compare him to Lassie. ,dogs,cs906zw,3,t5_2qhhk

Make sure you can keep a solid eye on himher at all times because puppies can move pretty fast and get into situations that can be damaging to your property and themselves. Also shameless plug here because I really love this company you should buy himher a BarkBox subscription! Theyre incredible. Its less than  a month and you can spend almost  on one decent toy at the pet store and you get a box in the mail each month that includes  toys treats and care items. The toys are awesome and you can let them know if your dog is a strong chewer and theyll mark hisher account so that they only send out the toughest stuff. The treats and chews are pretty awesome too. They include flavors like duck deer rabbit salmon yak elk and other fun stuff that I would never try buying my dog anywhere else. Theyre all made in the US and Canada and they try to go completely organic when possible. They also include care items sometimes like doggie wipes liquid bandage and water bottles and portable water bowls to keep your pup hydrated on the go. Usually each box has  toys a full sized bag of treats or  a chew or  and sometimes a cool care item. Its less than  a month and is such a great way to spoil your puppy and make sure they have an awesome array of toys as they grow up. You can also use all of the different types of treats to discover any food allergies or loves that your dog has. My pup LOVES duck. Like to a scary extent. If he ever stopped eating I would probably order a pack of the duck gummies that they sent us a couple months ago for him because hed probably still want them. And the best part is if your dog chews through something or doesnt like a treat for whatever reason you can email them and theyll give you a coupon code to replace it with something of your choice off of their website. They have a  happiness guarantee. Go to barkbox.com to check it out. If you do end up getting one use the code ZYIHTPWQYA to get both of us a free box added to our subscription. Puppy ownership is a crazy whirlwindy experience but its so rewarding. Lots of patience and love and best wishes to you guys!,dogs,csc0w3v,1,t5_2qhhk

4373199,0,t3_3b2ket,A lot of rescues do seem to have more restrictions than is usually needed.  But like most things in life its the  of idiots that ruin it for the  of the rest of us.  And so the rest of us end up having to follow stricter rules.Rescues are trying to make sure its a good home and a good match because its tough on the dogs if they get returned and could be tougher to find them adopters in the future since potential adopters could see failed adoptions as a red flag.  It also messes up a rescues planning a bit because after a dog is adopted out they usually get another to take its place in a foster home and they are left scrambling.  And of course they want to make sure that the dog will not be neglected abused treated poorly or treated in a way that makes the new owner unhappy with the dog and more likely to abandon it.So many times what look like terrific homes arent really so terrific after all and the dogs get returned or abandoned.  This can really make rescues a bit gunshy and overly cautious.But they do sometimes take it too far.  I think the attitude is that We cant do much for the other million needy dogs out there but were going to make sure the few lucky dogs in our care find the best homes possible.

It is not my duty to keep my socialized dog safe from someone elses outofcontrol aggressive pit bull that they feel like parading around other dogs. If your dog is aggressive its no ones duty but yours to keep that dog from attacking. That includes muzzling an untrustworthy dog around other dogs.And how would you know its easy for me to say that? You dont know if my dog has been bitten or aggressed. Second people arent letting their pit bulls go out of control on parade in my area. It doesnt matter what kind of dog it is its my duty to protect my dog and my kid from harm regardless of how that harm originated. If a dog got out by accident because some landscaper left the gate open its still my duty to fend for my kid. Thats the difference between you and me.

4399683,0,t3_3bekc9, Tick baths are not a good idea.  They can be safe but applying the chemicals in those shampoos to the skin means that the absorption can be a bit variable and can be too high.  It can be sort of easy to get tickpreventative related toxicity by using tick shampoos. Lyme disease is detected by a blood test.  The test identifies antibodies in your dogs blood which your dogs immune system only makes in response to a Lyme disease infection or exposure.  There is no way that a tick bath has any effect on this. You need to not give your dog a bath for  hours before and  hours after Revolution is applied for it to work best.  That is the only real effect of bathing with Revolution.Revolution is a prescription product because it also contains a heartworm preventative.  Frontline is NOT a prescription product meaning you do not have to buy it from a veterinarian.  I would just go buy some frontline now there is no reason to wait until July  and honestly I think Frontline does a better job at killing ticks and fleas than Revolution.  Keep in mind that if you go with Frontline you will still need to use a separate heartworm preventative and that will have to come from your vet.  At least getting Frontline now will solve your immediate tick problem.Just be aware that for any of the topical products Revolution Frontline Advantix etc it can take up to  hours for a tick that bites your dog to get enough of the product in their system to die.  There are products that are labeled to repel ticks as well as kill them I know that Advantix II and Seresto collars are labeled to actually deter ticks from even attaching to your dog Frontline and Revolution only kill ticks that bite your dog they do nothing if the tick doesnt bite.The best way to avoid Lyme disease is to use a preventative product AND ALWAYS CHECK YOUR DOG FOR TICKS if hes been outdoors especially in grassy fields.  You dont need to give him a tick bath just learn to remove ticks from him.,dogs,cslkufr,1,t5_2qhhk

4406894,0,t3_3bifmx,gtits mainly for protection of the yard and kidsThis is kind of worrying. Youre not likely to get many positive responses when seeking a dog to live outside  the great majority of breeds have been bred to be in close contact with humans and dont do well with lots of time alone. The exception is breeds that are bred for flock guarding like a Great Pyrenees not suggesting that just an example. Theyre practically raised with their flock and spend all their time watching over them. But you dont have a flock and it sounds like you want a dog to be a parttime activity there when kids want to play and a burglar alarm the rest of the time.Breeds that have hair instead of fur are the best bet for allergies but those breeds are also either typically companion breeds ie not going to do well outside or breeds like Poodles and Portuguese Water Dogs clingy and want to be around their people. I think you need to really make the decision to either find a dog that doesnt upset your allergies and can stay inside or a breed that will thrive outdoors. These livestock guardian breeds are also typically very independent for obvious reasons and they do tend to be large and shed. Being independent theyre hard to train to come when called or obey a boundary that you set. Many dogs will plow through an invisible fence when they see something like a squirrel then be stuck outside.,dogs,csme3p4,24,t5_2qhhk

I dont think exercise is the issue either because he always gets  walks a day each of which lasts over an hour. He gets attention most of the day so I guess the reason he gets angry is because there is no one down there with him. As for ways to deal with it I have already tried rewarding him he has a walk about an hour or two before he goes to sleep.

4428580,0,t3_3brxvv,Lol. My mom yelled at some older woman for walking her dog into our yard and letting the dog pee on my moms flowers. The womans response was well he has to pee she was visiting someone who had a backyard and then went so far as to say if you had a dog you would understand. Fuck these entitled assholes I would never leave poop in someones yard and the only place my dog is allowed to pee is in the sliver of grass between the sidewalk and the street which is usually public property anyway. I always try to get her to pee before a walk but sometimes she doesnt need to go until halfway through. I dont think you can expect that a dog will never mark or pee in your yard but they certainly shouldnt be letting their dog walk into your yard to do it. Its just disrespectful. I keep my dog on the sidewalk and never let her go more than a foot or so into someones yard usually she just wants to smell something. ,dogs,csowvgb,1,t5_2qhhk

4457519,0,t1_csrjk40,It is the same type of coat on a rough Chow. You can refer to anything written about the care of a rough coated Chow for a bear coated shar pei they have the exact same coat type. The longer coat will require more brushing of course and will take much longer to dry. When bathing you will need to take extra care to rinse thoroughly and dry as well as possible because if moisture or soap gets stuck against the skin the dense hair will trap it there and you may wind up with hot spots. The soft coat will not repel much water but the density of it might. They will probably not tolerate the heat as well as the shorter coated varieties.It seems like nobody can agree on whether or not they have an undercoat. They definitely seasonally shed which certainly suggests they do have an undercoat but apparently they are not supposed to and many dont.. but some do? ,dogs,cssjv4g,1,t5_2qhhk

4462107,0,t1_cst3ab1,That would not be a horrible choice  and could be quite effective.  The main reason I recommended the shotgun is that these coyotes were attacking as a pack attempting to flank you.  Plus you have multiple dogs.  There is no way you can insure that your dogs would not up and leave you  separating you from the ensuing fight.  I would be willing to bet that a shotgun fired straight up would stop a pack on the hunt.  But an Air Horn might be equally effective cheaper and nonlethal.I had three dogs whilst growing up in Georgia.  A very large stray dog picked up my Sheltie and shook him like a rag doll  then the stray came after me.  I managed to crawl on top of a large stone fence that he could not reach.  A week or so later the same large stray came into our backyard.  I went inside and got my Daisy BB gun an shot him in the ass several times.  Never saw him again.  Would suggest getting a pump repeating that can be quickly shot.  The attached link is to one that holds  BBs.  Youll probably need more than one shot if the coyote are on the run  and BBs dont fly exceedingly straight.So conclusion  yes to a BB gun combined with an Air Horn.  I would not go with a bolt action CO airgun which is not as fast as a pump BB in my opinion.Pepper sprays would only be effective on a single beast  not a circling pack.  Maybe not bad to have since they are so cheap.  Some watered down ammonia or pure would be just as effective as pepper spray if it were in a very good pump sprayer,dogs,cst4m1c,1,t5_2qhhk

Feed her whatever she wants and as much as she wants and if shes not eatinggive her whatever will get her to eat. Dont over do it on calcium.  Give her fenugreek supplements to help with milk production.  KEEP THE OTHER DOGS AWAY. The pups will pick up on her aggression and nervousness and it can kind of rub off on them and she may be unwilling to nurse with them around.Will fill in more info when I canEdit more thingsThe mother should be given anything that turns her on normal food with added broths liver yogurt cottage cheese anything appealing and high quality.Maiden bitches first litter are sometimes spoiled and do not behave maternally. Pampered dogs will find it kind of disgustinghaving to bathe feed them even though shes tired and hungry potty training and shes bored. Shes being forced to do all this work when she didnt ask for it or know it was coming. It then becomes the owners job to take over.If she is showing a lack of affection watch her for any aggression towards them. Sometimes females think that if they ignore the litter the puppies will go away. If the bitch does not care for them the owner will have to be responsible for hand raising them. If the bitch shows aggression do not force her to be near them except when she has to feed in which case you should be present. If the room is warm the dam does not have to be with them  and you can give her periodic breaks.Watch for eclampsia in the bitchappears during the st  weeks. Caused by a deficiency in blood calcium.

4563972,0,t1_ct5tq1u,Haha like  of the time they just act like giant puppies.My advice is that you need to stimulate them mentally as well as physically to keep them happy. Smelling games are great. Get some treats hide them around the house and let them go find it. Or keep teaching them new tricks. Or you can even play hide and seek.As for physical exercise like I said walks are nothing for them. Dog parks are great nothing tires out a dog better than another dog. I hope you have a big yard or park nearby. Playing fetch is the next best thing.Mine loved to wrestle and rough play but you may not want to encourage that. Im a decent sized guy with a lot of muscle and hes still pretty challenging to play fight with. A lb dog coming at you from a full sprint doesnt always feel very pleasant.

Theyre chasing the furry object because instinct is telling them to catch it and kill it. I would absolutely not rely on a dog stopping themselves once theyve caught their prey. To me that sounds like a dog that doesnt actually have high prey drive or chase drive. If OP is accurate about how driven their dog is then this is a dead cat in the making. I would definitely not recommend they test it out and see if their dog will actually kill the cat when they catch it. ,dogs,ctb1vve,5,t5_2qhhk

Also look into getting doggie stairs for your couch and bed and carry him up and down the stairs if it is hard for him. It is very dangerous for small dogs to jump off a high bed.

4635899,0,t1_ctevnwi,You just said that pitbulls WANT to fight. Which has already proven you do not KNOW really anything what so ever. Ive owned several and not one has EVER been in a fight with another dog or human. Not once. Yet Ive seen golden damn retrievers start fights at dog parks. EVERY breed will posture if it feels threatened. No breed is exempt from that. And seriously the fact that you think that just goes to show how seriously uneducated on the matter you are.Dogs do not wag their tail in a fight. Dogs wag tails when they are playing.Again this shows you know NOTHING about dogs.Lastly so my dog should be muzzled because of the breed it is? Do you seriously not understand how ignorant that statement is? Regardless of its actions or personality? So do you also think that chihuahuas should be muzzled? Chihuahuas are statistically MUCH more likely to be aggressive. Do you think chows should be muzzled? How about dalmatians? What about labs or German Shepherds?All of the dogs I just listed consistently fail behavioral tests at a higher rate than ANY pit bull breed. And these behavioral tests encompass both dog to dog behavior as well as dog to stranger dog to child etc.This link is the American Temperament Testing society. One of the largest dog behavioral studies ongoing in the world. You should really look at it and get educated.EDIT if you had said ANY DOG should be muzzled in public. Id have let that one slide because at least you arent showing any ignorant bias to any particular breed. However the fact that you seem to think only CERTAIN breeds should be muzzled is really pretty ignorant. Just as ignorant as thinking only certain ethnic groups do certain crimes. Hence why I said that to show you how outlandish the statement is.And no. I personally do not think you should have kids. And DEFINITELY do not think you should be a dog owner. In the slightest. Dog owners like you who are seriously nothing but fear mongers when it comes to specific breeds all of which has been proven time and time again to be false and based on no real facts. So you having kids will just be you teaching and spreading the same bias that isnt true. And you owning dogs and acting like my dog is some kind of threat to yours because she walks by and would actually probably ignore you shes extremely well trained again just further pushes a false claim that is proven untrue. ,dogs,ctex9mn,-1,t5_2qhhk

4647492,0,t3_3e6ss0,My  year old golden retriever Cooper had his second TPLO just yesterday.  So I know how you are feeling!Cooper originally had a left knee injury back in February.  There was a lot of snow at the time and he jumped off the steps and landed but his left leg must have caught the edge of a step when he landed because he gave a loud yelp of pain and refused to put weight on it for the rest of the day.  After some deliberation and a second opinion we decided to to a TPLO.  I was hesitant because some internet message boards had stories of botched procedures and complications.  Finally we settled on a very respected surgeon Dr. Wanda GordonEvans and on May  he had the TPLO procedure in left knee.  The surgeon also did a meniscal release which just cuts the meniscus away from the bone and helps prevent future tears.  The surgery is not terribly long....  only about an hour or so but my facility WVRC in Waukesha WI keeps them overnight.  During this stay they transition from IV pain meds to oral.  I like the facility we chose because it is also a  hour emergency vet which means there is staff there around the clock to care for your pet.  When we went to pick him up the next day we brought along an old towel to use as a sling under his stomach just in front of his hind legs.  Its a bit awkward so if you have a chance practice with your pup for a few days before the surgery so heshe gets used to it a little.  Its worth noting that the sling isnt necessarily meant to carry the weight of the dog but its more like a crutch.  It gives them something to lean on and helps them get around.  Its also useful in case of a stumble or trip.  The last thing you would want is for your dog to brace with the surgery leg to prevent a trip or fall....  so the towel works great.  As for the actual recovery.....  the first day back dont be surprised if there is excessive panting whining or crying.  We called the vet and asked about this and they assured us that it was not pain he was on Tramadol which is a pretty strong pain killer.  They said that it is mostly due to being scared and uncomfortable with the situation.  They dont know what happened and they dont feel right.  Some close attention and lots of pets help to ease the anxiety.  The anxiety tapered off after only a few hours.  The most difficult part of the recovery was getting Cooper to take his meds.  At first we were able to hide them in food but he would pretty quickly sniff out the tramadol inside and spit whatever it was out.  We tried sausage hot dogs cheese bread liverwurst peanut butter..... you name it.  The problem is that the tramadol is extremely bitter.  If they get it on their tongue they will spit it out.  Cooper crunched on tablet up and it was so bitter that he started foaming at the mouth as he spat it out.  So we had to find a solution.  We went to a health food store and found empty gel caps.  We then cut the tramadol in half and put them inside the gel caps.  The gel caps stopped the bitterness from hitting his tongue and made it much easier to give him his pills.  I just wish we had done this from the start.  He would still chew pieces of hot dog and spit out the gel cap.  Its like he knew to look for them.  Our final solution was to buy a piller.  It is like a syringe for pills my wife swears it looks like a tampon applicator but I wouldnt know....obviously.  The greatest success has come from using a couple pieces of meat bacon ham etc or some peanut butter and the piller.  I give him a piece or two of meat or a dab of peanut butter and let him eat it.  Then he gets the meds in the piller.  You have to stick it pretty far into their mouth.... you dont want them to gag but a tiny gag and youll know your far enough in.  Push out the pills and immediately offer another piece of meat or peanut butter.  Cooper will swallow the pills and go right for the meat.  Thats the best way I have found thus far.  So recovery was progressing OK and we made the appointment to get the sutures removed.  A few days before the appointment my wife was taking him outside on a lead and she said he gave a quiet little yelp and then didnt want to walk at all.  He was arching his back in an attempt to take the weight off both knees but no matter what he did it hurt.  We used the towelsling and got him inside and decided to ask the vet about it when we went to get the sutures out in a couple of days.  As it turns out Cooper had torn the CCL is his NONTPLO knee right side.  So now he had one knee that was in recovery and the other was torn.  We made a plan to have the right knee repaired after  weeks.  The  week mark is when they generally do postop xrays to see how everything is healing.  We scheduled it so that they did left side postop xrays and right side preop xrays on the same visit.  We waited about a week to get the same surgeon and on July  Cooper had his second right knee TPLO.  As I type this he is currently asleep.  His next meds will be due in about three hours.  He is festooned with the cone of shame but only because we cannot watch him while we sleep.  I dread waking up and finding his incision inflamed because he had been licking it all night.  The cone prevents that.  Plan on using a cone for the first  days or so.  We take it off when we are able to supervise him.  It makes it easier for him to eat and drink.  TLDRCooper had a left side TPLO in March.  Within the first week of recovery the right side TPLO ruptured.  The left side is now almost fully healed and he has just had surgery to repair the right side.  This was very long and I hope you are able to get some valuable information from it.  Use the slingtowel.  Use a leash for all potty breaks.  Keep your pup confined and as quiet as possible.  Expect the other knee to fail and require surgery.  The only positive of the right side failing is that it forced him to use his surgery leg a little more.  This helped with rebuilding muscle that had shrunk away due to him favoring it.  We are also able to overlap the healing time a little.  Weight management is also critical.  Cooper is skinny at  lbs but overweight dogs have a difficult time recovering.  Dogs can also gain weight in the  weeks of restricted activity so consider cutting back on food. Please feel encouraged to ask any questions you might have.  I dont have all the answers but I will do what I can to help you out!  ,dogs,ctgdow1,1,t5_2qhhk

The difference between she and him is that she is manageable and has owners willing to work on her.Some dogs just arent social and do better alone. Shed likely be better if she and her packmate had been adopted out together but that boat has sailed. At this point you need to work on managing her behavior and getting her to understand that while you get it the behavior still isnt acceptable.Oh and please start socializing her with kids. Issues with other dogs does not always mean issues with children.

If you want to really get into hunting it would be a good idea to get a hunting dog.  If you want to get into herding it would be a good idea to get a herding dog.When you get a mutt or a dog that is bred badly you are getting a grab bag.  Now an adult dog more or less has a set personality but the problem often with shelters is that you cannot see that actual personality.  It takes time for dogs to be comfortable and most are super stressed in shelters.  Thats why Im so fond of rescues that have foster homes.  Its much easier to get an idea of what a dog is like when its living in an environment similar to your environment.With a reputable breeder however you also get that predictableness.  Youll know approximately how much exercise a dog will need how biddable how stubborn etc.  Additionally there are just some types of dogs that just dont come up in rescue very often.Theres nothing wrong with going to a breeder so long as that breeder is reputable doing all the appropriate health clearences trying to better the breed and is breeding dogs who are of high merit.,dogs,ctjglco,16,t5_2qhhk

Doing them slightly wrong walking away doing each command so slowly the request becomes pointless huffing and whining etc. They understood the limits of training and knew what wasnt as serious. That is they knew they couldnt attack or poop everywhere or jump up. They also knew that standing around when told to sit wasnt a big deal in most contexts.

4748180,0,t3_3fx7ii,Ive got an  month old and hes  my dream dog. I got to know the breed while spending time around horses and a couple people I knew had them. What I like about them is theyre a big smart dog in a compact package. Theyre dogs you can take anywhere and do anything with.Mine has sped through basic and advanced obedience novice rally obedience and once we get situated in a new city next month Ill be looking for a place to get him into agility fundamentals and work up from there. Im also working on tasks for his Canine Good Citizenship medal and am hoping that if he continues to be as good natured as he is that perhaps we can get him certified to do therapy...provided he mellows out a little more Great dog superbly intelligent and my best friend in the whole world. Im so used to taking him with me places and having him in my back seat that the other day when I went to the mall and he couldnt come I caught myself talking out loud as I would when hes in the car. Its become weird NOT to see his little ears in the rearview mirror.The main challenge Ive had is that hes a one person dog and its been really hard sometimes to not have an off day. Everything everybody else does for him is subpar to when I do it. He could spend all day playing with my husband and going on cool adventures but if I havent been home all day hell squeal like a pig and almost wiggle out of his skin the minute I step through the door. Ive worked really hard to teach others how to handle him as Im always aware that therell be the off moment Im NOT there and they need to be able to handle him in that situation. Doesnt matter I still get called because other family members havent spent as long as I have with him and its hard for them to read his behaviour. I dont get a break from being his owner hes kind of this tiny little planet that orbits around his person and if you take his person away hes spinning out of control. After having him for  months and spending every day with him often with nobody else home we know each others routine better than anybody else.Its not that anybody else COULDNT handle him anybody could learn but he and I are a good team and we really shine when were working together he just doesnt have that spark with other people and so everything is kinda...dull.Hes very protective and very loyal. Even at  months old hes very much about the business of protecting me from threats.The other day the threat of choice was a stack of fancy dinner plates we were getting rid of that he had never seen before. Previous times its been the smell of the neighbors smoking pot P I appreciate his interest in my safety bahaha.Meet my best friend.First photo is him three hours into being owned by us. He was  weeks old. Second is him playing in the trails with me. Third is his glamour shot  Fourth is him at about seven months old hes a pretty nicely built little fellow.Edit Also I LOVE that he talks. He and I have little conversations all the time especially if hes feeling extra sassy. If I tell him off hell grumble under his breath to get the last word in because hes a sassmonster. He also makes weird noises when he has to poop that increase in desperation and volume as the need becomes more urgent. He also piggy squeals whenever I come see him if Ive been gone which is freaking adorable and he only does it for me so yeah Im special and were in love.,dogs,ctt1xds,4,t5_2qhhk

4795913,0,t1_ctyo71n,gt Find a behaviorist. A dog going back to square one shows that the dog was not solid at all.Some dogs are resilient and some are not. I always say that my older dog can walk thru an absurdly busy trial building with everyone barking and being reactive and carrying on and she wont even notice. She doesnt care. They can lunge at her and growl and she just marches on.Thats sort of rare. Most dogs are somewhat unnerved by other dogs behaving badly. Some startle and recover and some may never get over a truly bad encounter. When that happens all you can do is manage them. In this case I would not walk my dog near the house of the assholes. Id walk another route. If they wont control and contain their dog you have to actively manage your dog so he doesnt go near that dog. Again some dogs are attacked shake it off and go on with life. I had a dog who as a puppy was attacked by an adult Bull Mastiff bitch. she outweighed him by a good  pounds or so. He was rolled and bitten. For the rest of his life...he was absolutely fine. He was friendly with other dogs good around all breeds never at all scared of them. But not all dogs are like that. Many do not recover from an attack like that and do have to be managed carefully after that. Some dogs are inherently reactive and an event will set the down the path of aggression. Again careful management is needed to ensure that they dont get to act out their wildest dreams. ,dogs,ctz2av6,3,t5_2qhhk

Id much rather get  for running a mile rather than a good job! Take treats out with you whenever youre trying to get her to pee and throw a party for her when she goes. Lots of happy noises pets a couple treats and reward with playtime. Its important for them to learn that they have to peepoop first then they get to play.

4825039,0,t3_3gyxp1,How is his Leave it and drop it?Weve had some success in the last two years with a somewhat similar issue. Grow it loves shoes and would tear them up. Now he will occasionally grab a show but he wont destroy it at all. In fact he sort of just collects them. Its annoying but far better than the destructive past.We came to this point with a very steady and patient approach to these objects. First we let him know wed take them away and had that right but we reward him for the exchange with either a small treat hes food motivated and trains well with treats or a different dogappropriate toy. Our breakthrough though came when he took an old sandal. We got it away from him and then I took the opportunity to wait for a bit and I traded it back to him for the other toy Id given him earlier. We did that a few more times and removed the sandal every time he started to get toothy with it. We reinforced with Gromit No. Dont do it. And if he continued to look like he was about to chew. Wed take it away and give him a dog toy. After awhile he did well and now responds to Dont do it quite reliably. He also seems to know that those objects arent his and that he can go to town on his objects.Im certain we have done several things inappropriately. But it has basically worked for our dog and his shoewallet destruction tendencies have gone.,dogs,cu2qhfm,3,t5_2qhhk

4853322,0,t1_cu63d9h,Okay I see from your reply to another comment above that you are new to the whole training thing. My advice is to do some reading and videowatching before starting with your dog. Definitely use treats!! You can use her kibble and make her work for her meals as well as more highvalue treats like very small bits of cheese chicken or hot dogs. You phase out the treats over time once she knows the commands well but for now and the near future be prepared to treat a lot!Also you dont need to use an actual clicker. Some people use a word like Yes! though personally I prefer to make a kissy sound with my lips as this is quick easy and pretty much always comes out the same way. Id recommend a treat bag because it makes life easier.  Here are links to videos from four different trainers about starting with clicker trainingGetting Started with Clicker TrainingBasic Technique Tutorial for Beginners  Donna Hill Starting out in Clicker Training  Donna Hill PlaylistClicker Training | Teachers Pet With Victoria Stilwell Victoria StillwellKikopups Guide to Clicker Training  Emily LarlhamWhat is clicker training? dog training  Kikopup  Emily Larham Heres a link playlist from tab  Training Positive  it starts with an introduction video and then continues with a huge list of other things.They are all positive reinforcement i.e. forcefree trainers and if you watch a selection of their videos youll start to get a feel for them you may prefer one to another  go with who you like! and what they are teaching. As I said it is better to watch a number of them make notes and bookmarksave links for reference before starting with your pup. You can read more about clicker on Karen Pryors website where it is set out very nicely and of course find a lot more stuff by searching the web.Free shaping is really interesting and extra mentally challenging to your dog  you can read about it here. I highly recommend that you take some basic classes with your dog so that a trainer can help you become a better trainer to your dog. Find a force free positive reinforcement trainer in your area that gives group classes. The other advantage is that this will give your dog an opportunity to socialise with others and perhaps you can find some suitable playdates too.,dogs,cu6apu2,1,t5_2qhhk

Theres just too much fur. I brush my guys out daily and even at this time of the year I can still get a lot of fur off of them. Goldens are great family dogs if you train them.

She sounds like shes really lucky to have found you especially with all those beds!  Personally I dont think you should ever get another dog just as a companion for another dog. I think it has to be for you first then a companion for your dog as a bonus. If you want another dog then I think thats fine and maybe shell come to love it  But be aware that you do run the risk of them never being anything more than just roommates. With regards to the housebreaking its possible that youll struggle if the new dog starts using the floor as the scent from the accidents may lead to your Yorkie using the floor too. My adult dog regressed slightly when we got our puppy for the same reason but it was relatively easy to reinforce her toilet training and we just did a few days of really watching her and reminding her of what she should be doing.

What happens if you have to travel and your dog has never been in a crate before and the is forced in to one for the duration of travel. Youd end up with a super stressed out dog.Or the rottis and huskies that chew holes through walls and doors because they were left out and could not handle it yet. I would much rather have a dog who is comfortable with relaxing in a crate while I am at work than have a few thousand dollars worth of vet bills from my dog getting into something she shouldnt have.

4934121,0,t1_cue8o17,Honestly if you can afford it Id consult with a behaviourist. Not for the bumsniffing incident necessarily but about the whole thing so you can have someone experienced to guide you.Some of what you say sounds really great the walking together and the sharing of the plush bed... but I have zero experience of Pitbulls and you want someone who does. Someone experienced in dog aggressive breeds who can actually observe your dogs is what you should be looking for IMO. If you go down this route make sure you look for a reputable professional  get back to me if you need pointers.Do you think you can do that?Otherwise my best suggestion is to rewrite your question giving as much detail as you can and post to rdogtraining  cross posting to a Pitbull sub may be a good idea too.With dogs Ive learned that it is far better to avoid bad stuff than have to deal with training it out later so I think it is worth investing what you can to ensure your two dogs continue to have a smooth and happy relationship  avoiding anything to the contrary. ,dogs,cughh82,2,t5_2qhhk

4941932,0,t3_3ilm5n,If she got into a tiff before hand and ended up with the injury that could have been why she was bearing her teeth at the staff. If she was hurting she may have been more grumpy. Unless you know the exact origin of the injury its hard to say.Its not uncommon for unruly dogs to be put in a time out if the staff cant handle the dog it becomes unsafe so ultimately time outs are the best option though they should still be paying attention to her if she is separated other wise she could start feeling anxious and try to escape like you said.Have you taken her to a trainer? Maybe do so to reinforce any obedience training for her and try to run her before taking her to daycare so she is slightly less abrasive towards the other animals. And finding a good daycare who can handle high energy dogs better is a really good idea.

4943057,0,t3_3ij0je,I work at a vets office and this is my take on a few of your questions after seeing countless owners make the tough decision If you think its time its probably time. Remember you are making this decision for them so although you may not be ready they are. As someone already said if they are not enjoying the things in life they use to theres no point in making them live a life that they cannot enjoy anymore. Definitely consider at home euthanasiaMost vets will do home visits for this sort of thing at an additional charge. I think that the most important thing for a pet in their final moments is to be comfortable and relaxed and this can best be done at home. Especially if your pet is very anxious at the vet like mine it seems best to avoid that stress in such a moment.If you canPLEASE STAY WITH YOUR PET. Ive seen some people who cannotwill not be in the room or simply drop their pet off for euthanasia and I think that is not fair to your dog. I think the best thing you could possibly do for the pet in the final moment is to be there with themcomfort and love them as they fall asleep. They lived their life loving you and they deserve to have the center of their lives there as they go.    Just try to stay calm as you are with her and enjoy your time together. Obviously this is not easy but as dog owners its our responsibility to do whats best for them. Just remember that every decision you are making is in her best interest because she cannot make these decisions herself.,dogs,cuhm185,1,t5_2qhhk

4947101,0,t3_3imw1s,Toddlers and new dogs are not a great idea. Toddlers god bless em love to mess around in stuff... Something dogs do not love. Even the most loving gentle sweet dog is a potential bite risk if you stop watching the kids for a second and they decide they just have to yank on a tail or an ear. A lab or a golden will absolutely be a great choice for your family but maybe once your youngest child is at least . This has a number of advantages your children will be more independent so they wont need as focused of attention meaning you can look after the dog and theyll be able to help with minor dog chores.Also and this is the big also you mention that your wife stays at home. In all likelihood this means shell be doing  of the work of caring for the dog and if you do opt for a puppy which I dont recommend in your circumstance it will be her and not you who is taking the dog out every hour on the hour to pee loading the kids in the stroller for every midday walk of which a puppy needs several who will be coping with the puppy razor chewing teeth etc.Is she okay with the idea of essentially getting another child for a few months while the puppy reaches adulthood? If she blanches at the thought go adult. Adult is easier to get in rescue but often breeders will have retired show dogsshow washouts who are also a good pick.Anyway main thing is to wait a little bit. The kids will appreciate the excitement of getting a dog when theyre that bit older and plus the workload will be a little more manageable domestically.,dogs,cui4ep3,3,t5_2qhhk

4967811,0,t3_3iwst8,I was in the same boat with you I asked my husband for a dog on and off for years before he finally caved. He didnt like dogs in general always made grossedout noises at other peoples dogs and frequently brought up bad experiences hed previously had when asked to look after dogs.When he finally reluctantly agreed I was nervous that wed end up with a dog he didnt like so I focused a ton of attention on making it our dog not my dog. I made sure he came to the rescue with me to pick one out and we chose the one dog at the rescue that he wanted that seemed to bond with him the most. A week later Mr. Dog Hater is completely enamored. When he gets home the dog gets a cuddle before I do and everyone elses dog is suddenly super cute in his eyes. He even carried our little gremlin to the vet in an open backpack chuckling the whole time. I guess what Im saying is that something transformative happens when a creature loves you and depends on you more than anyone else. So maybe since youre so secure with dogs try to get an affectionate breed and put him in the alpha position? Something cuddly. Ive got a Pekingese  Pug mix and shes very affectionate doesnt bark behaves well around other dogs but does have a smooshed face and goggly eyes. I agree with some of the other posters on here  all of the conditions he has cant be met in a single dog but I think that if he likes the individual dog the conditions that arent met might not matter so much anymore. ,dogs,cukqaje,3,t5_2qhhk

The good thing is most cats really arent interested in seeing what a dog is chewing on so you shouldnt have a problem there. Besides that just make sure the cat has a gated off room thats only hers. To help her warm up to the dog if she isnt especially dog savvy try feeding canned cat food on the kitchen table or other high place. So Nora cant get to her but the cat still learns that Noras presence  really good things. For my cats canned food is the most amazing thing on the planet but it could be something else like cooked chicken for this gal.My cats simply coexist with my dogs. One cat will never be in a room that a dog is in and the other stays up on high ground. On the other hand she could be a cat that likes to snuggle and groom dogs. You never know until you bring them home because lets face it cats are weird.Edit I should add jealousy is totally a dog trait even if thats not the  term people like to use. You are a resource. You provide pets cuddles playtime walks everything really. Its possible Nora will feel like her resource you is being taken up by the new cat in the house. Treatspraise will be your friend!

Poor baby. And another one! A few months later in a different place WITH A GUY STAYING THE NIGHT... the little man wakes me up at am after the boy and I had been up till dawn partying and doing...other things. He hasnt made a mess yet but hes giving me his omg mom I need to go out NOW NOW NOW signal. So I find clothes and run him outside so he can spew liquid on the grass. Get back inside pass out for another  hours before he wakes me up again to do the same thing. At this point Im actually worried so I go back inside and tell the boy who was visiting from Australia so he was staying for a few days that we need to get up and take my dog to the clinic thank god Im a vet tech so I can pretty much stop by my work whenever just need to let them know Im coming. I figure since my dog had just spewed outside that wed have some time to get our hungover selves situated and get in the car. So were finding our clothes and wallets and keys and I turn to find my dog squatting in the hallway spewing liquid on my thank GOD for this wood floors. In front of the guy. Who had to then ride in the car with the two of us to the clinic...and my dog likes to ride in the lap of whoever is sitting shotgun. He was hilariously afraid of my dog shitting in his lap.

5162264,0,t3_3lplkw,First  days is too young for a puppy to be away from its litter. It doesnt matter if the mother rejected them out not the period from  weeks is critical in a puppys development. That is when they play with their littermates and learn how to interact with dogs and develop bite inhibition.  Ideally your puppy should have stayed with his litter until they were  weeks old. Because he left his litter too young you may have some training problems. I would recommend checking out the sidebar and wiki on rdogtraining. Pay special attention to anything about bite inhibition.  rpuppy is another great resource for raising a puppy.gt at what age the dog can be trained to take commands such as Sit Stay or any other basic command? Puppies can start to learn those kind of commands at a very young age younger than your puppy is so by all means get started!  Be aware though that young puppies have very short attention spans so limit the training to about  minutes at a time. Also be aware that some breeds huskies and samoyeds included are known to be stubborn and difficult to train so patience is going to be key.gtI got him soft treats he likes them but he is not enthusiastic about them like I see in videos so it is making rewarding him kinda hard any tips?Try some different kinds of treats. The smellier the better. You can also try some very very small pieces of hot dog or boiled chicken.You may find that hes just not very food motivated. Not every dog scarfs down treats like a lab or beagle would.  Its not unusual for northern breeds to ignore a treat if it means they dont have to do what you say again theyre stubborn.You can also try training him using a particularly fun toy as a reward.  That may or may not work but if he has a toy he really likes its worth a shot.gtHe sleeps a lot during the day which is worrying me because he doesnt like his crate and he cries all night sometimes I took him to a walk last night around midnight and he slept better is that a good solution? Hes a baby. Babies sleep a lot. Taking him for a walk before bed can be a good way to help him settle down just make sure youre keeping the walks short at this point so you dont harm his growing joints.  Some vigorous play time before bed can help too just give him a chance to calm down afterwards before you go to bed.Also make sure youre making the crate a fun happy place for him not just sticking him in there at bedtime. Theres some information on the subreddits I linked to earlier on how to do that.Finally he may be sleeping a lot now but be prepared to have a very active dog when he gets older. Huskies and samoyeds are among the highest energy breeds out there. When hes full grown youre probably going to be looking at  hours per day of vigorous exercise. Two walks per day isnt going to cut it.,dogs,cv88tij,10,t5_2qhhk

5170377,0,t1_cv96upc,. Couldnt find a source on that actually it was probably something I just heard. Closest I got was a wikipedia entry on their Omnivore page which saysgt Wolf subspecies including wolves dogs dingoes and coyotes have a general preference and are evolutionarily geared towards meat but also will voluntarily eat plant material like fruits vegetables and grasses and can live on such indefinitely. Also the maned wolf is a canid whose diet is naturally  plant matter.But thats wikipedia and so may very well be dead wrong so Ill take your word for it.gt Dogs often dont digest grains at allNow this is something Im definitely interested in. This would for sure make foods with more grains of a lesser quality. Do you have a source for this? Definitely interesting. On some shallow research though Ive found this which says the opposite.gt That abundance of vitamins minerals and nutrients is found in many different protein sources. Fish bring something to the table that chicken does not. Beef brings something to the table that fish does not. With kibble you can feed a purely chickenbased kibble but there will have to be vitamins and minerals added in to get a balanced diet. With a raw diet like the ones wolves ate they need a variety of different protein sources to stay at optimum healthYoure right that makes sense. But my real question is whether they can get the same nutritional value from things like starches and grains as they can from these different meats. At the end of the day its not where the nutrients came from its whether or not theyre getting the nutrients from any source that they can digest.gt Because youre an omnivoreI meant what I said in regards to a variety of different ingredients looks more attractive as in it looks like it would give a variety of different nutrients however youre correct that they could get different nutrients from different meats and not just completely different kinds of foods.gt Because dogs are carnivoresBut theyre not according to my previously posted link this website this book and National Geographic,dogs,cv97ykd,1,t5_2qhhk

I make it a point to keep a little anonymity there are some creepy people on reddit. I showed you a video of almost exactly what our dogs look like when theyre barking on command. Imagine that over and over again and the dog walking to the end of the leash. Can you not picture a dog barking at the end of a leash? I dont know what youre getting at here. I never claimed I crosstrained my service dogs in protection. But since you didnt read all the way down here was the comment chain for you gt What your SO can do that is significantly less dangerous but gets the point across is teaching a growl or bark on command. I remember there was someone in this sub a while ago that taught their dog to growl and pull on the leash when she said the word steady to make it look like she had a barely controlled vicious dog.gt How would I go about teaching my dog to bark on command? And more importantly how would I teach her to shut up once she gets started?gt You can capture the behaviour mark reward and then introduce the cuecommand or you can manufacture it. Take treats or toys something that gets your dog excited that they want and you mark and reward for the precursor signals they give before the bark stretching it until you get the bark. Then mark massively reward. Repeat. Add in the cue.gt soooo basically if someone is about to rob you give the command and your dog will turn and bark at you wagging its tail waiting for a treat??Thats where you stepped in. The whole time we were discussing how to train a pet dog to resemble a dog trained in protection. The hypothetical dog here doesnt need schutzhund titles or even look intimidating. It just needs to look capable of biting its large and has teeth right? and be causing a scene. Thats how I was interpreting that comment chain which is why I chimed in on how I trained service dogs to do something very similar. Youre the one that introduced the actual protection element of someone trying to rob you. Other than that it was all about deterrents and peace of mind. Anyways I think we about beat this subject to death. You train protection dogs I train service dogs. Theyre both capable of barking on cue. That about sums this comment chain up. ,dogs,cv9rn93,1,t5_2qhhk

5284247,0,t3_3ncde5,Ok so this thread is really interesting to me because we ended up with a border collie. I say ended up because we were primarily looking for an aussie  thats how Kafka was advertised and now I really doubt theres any aussie in him at all. There might be a little bit of cattle dog but the way he acts is so much like a border collie its crazy. Hell crouch and watch dogs at the park so intensely they start crouchrunning and then hell flank them and attempt to herd them. He definitely has the border collie stare. However I really doubt he was bred well. You mention a lot about how you have to be really careful about breeding a border collie as they can turn out pretty neurotic. So far Kafka seems all right  he tends to be low energy a lot of the time like its been raining all day and hes all right with some shorter walks and I gave him his foodball thing to push around for breakfast. Other than that hes been sleeping. To get to the point do I need to worry about him? We only rescued him two months ago so I highly doubt everything has come out but I really doubt he was bred well. The hoarder guy was breeding merles to merles if that gives you any indication. Should I just not consider him a border collie and not worry about it? Or should I keep my eye out for destructive tendencies and such? I dont want a totally crazy dog but I definitely felt intimidated upon learning how much of a BC he is  Im familiar with aussies not BCs and aussies seem to be a little more mellowforgiving though still high energy.Anyway!

Im not sure if youve ever had two or more dogs in the same house but keeping them separated is not easy to do.

But youre right shes not very adoptable meaning she may end up being euthanized anyway. There is no recognized breed as a mini Australian shepherd. If thats what she was sold to you as chances are she didnt come from a reputable breeder. And poorly bred dogs such as these are prone to serious behavioral issues like you are seeing.

5429677,0,t3_3pev5j,As a user I am somewhat intrigued by this list as it shows me you actually screen breeders against some list of criteria although I dont know why these breeders in particular failed.I feel like the purpose of this list could be better communicated in a way that educates instead of shames? These people contacted you likely in ernest they didnt make the cut which is GREAT that you are putting so much care into this but now by proxy they are being shamed. You have two user groups to keep in mind and depending on how your service makes money I am guessing throughs listing subscriptions from breeders you probably do not want to completely alienate a source of income.You are also posting peoples personal information names and email addresses on a shame list...this is really REALLY not a great reflection on you as a partner to the breeders or as a citizen of the internet.Edit  I found the reasons part of this list this page is so long....so hard to digest and as much as this may make sense as a passionate dog person...this is only has the high potential to ignite a lot of hate. A lot of these breeders are REALLY not good breeders like not even a little bit. But as a business and someone positioning themselves as an educator it is generally best to take the high road whenever you can. To Synaxiss point  you may be better off helping people really focus in on finding a good breeder and how to do that. The list of bad breeders and why they are bad is infinitely longer than the good and ultimately is not that helpful other than inspiring emotions. If I am really getting sucked in by these bad breeders I am probably a relatively small part of your websites audience.I obviously do not know the research behind your site and this is just coming from experience and assumption  but without a really strong user based driver Id maybe reconsider this piece as part of your messaging and brand.,dogs,cw5p3m9,1,t5_2qhhk

5430966,0,t1_cw5tyvo,gt Is there anything that can be done to mitigate for the shedding?Brushing often not quite as often as twice daily but every day or every other day will definitely cut down on the loose hair in your house but it will not eliminate it. Bathing them then drying with a high velocity blow dryer during their shedding season double coated dogs blow their coats twice a year will also help immensely. But if youre looking for a dog you dont have to sweep or vacuum for these dogs are not them. There is a lot of truth in not shaving a double coated dogs. It will ruin their outer guard hairs and leave them much more exposed then they were designed to be. Their hair may never grow back in correctly if they are repeatedly shaved and it puts them at a greater risk of exposure related illnesses like skin cancer and overheating. gt I dont mind the barking if its for my protection at all. See the problem with this is that dogs with guarding instincts tend to thing a lot more things need to be protected against than actually do. In the time Ive written this comment my GSD has barked at my roommate coming home a car door slamming and a dog barking. Only one of those was an actual valid concern someone entering the house yet he barks at multiple things all day long. Can you train them to quiet down? Sure. I just give Chief a disruptive command like go to your bed and he lays down and chills.

5561769,0,t3_3r8aad,When I worked in an office the dogs had to be wellsocialized up to date on vaccinations pottytrained and crate trained. Pups stayed in a crate at your desk and were not allowed to wander unsupervised. There was an unofficial threestrikes kind of policy if your pup soiled in the building or got into trouble. If they were disruptive or growly they were not allowed back. People brought young puppies that werent potty trained and honestly had no problem. Pups stayed in their crates and were taken out frequently to prevent accidents. The biggest issue there would be finding an appropriate doggy potty area with extra poopbags and a trash can. Nobody likes dog poop hangin around. ,dogs,cwmhkzy,2,t5_2qhhk

Vinegar is an odor neutrelizer but you really want to get the urine out of the carpet or it will start smelling again. This is where the corn flour comes in. It very absorbent and soaks up the moisture including the old urine. Is it a wall to wall carpet? If not spinkle a good amount of corn flour under the rug aswell.

5619884,0,t3_3s2n0x,Number  how do you work with what you get?First lets look at WHY dogs are relinquished to get an idea of what kind of damage is done. The majority of the surrendered dogs . were between  months and  years of age. The majority of dogs . had been owned from  months to  year. Approximately half of the pets . of dogs surrendered were not neutered. Most dogs  had not received any obedience training.SourceYou have adolescent dogs who are entering or entered sexual maturity with zero training. Thats a recipe for failure. The medium to large dogs are no longer small enough to be cute or to physically control. The owners havent bothered putting any effort into training and gosh now they are just plain out of ideas on what to do. Youll need to anticipate training from Day . Structure consistency clear expectations and so on will be super important. What are the rules of the house? How will you set the dog up to succeed yet firmly and kindly discourage incorrect behavior? If you dont want the dog on the couch where should the dog lay and how will you communicate that?  You dont want to come down like a stack of bricks on a brand new dog but you do want to start enforcing basic rules. The hardest part imo of bringing in a new adultish dog is not knowing what youre getting. If you adopt from a private rescue that does fostering the foster home can tell you all about the dog. But if you go to a shelter and the dogs are all in kennel runs its hard to know which dogs bark out the window or wont go into a crate easily or want to claim the bedcouch or resource guard. So as an adopter having a good general idea of how to manage some common unwanted behaviors is important. The training can come later. Example.. My foster dog liked to chase our cat. So he wore a long line in the house to make him stop. From day  he wasnt allowed to chase her. There was no attempt to train or correct him we just wanted to stop him. The training would come later as we became more familiar with one another and I could read him better. But for that first day we simply prevented him from chasing the cat. Focus work a leave it command recall and a couple swift corrections came much later. ,dogs,cwtp8d2,2,t5_2qhhk

Having small prey like animals like a smaller dog can ignite those instincts.While over all I do agree that it is each owners responsibility to watch their own dogs and keep them safe I do not agree with letting small dogs into the big dog area when there is a separation for a reason especially when they have defined weight limits for each. I do not have a dog with a high prey drive like OPs but if I did I would be removing my dog from the dog park should someone decide their dog is more important and deserves to be in an area they should not be.,dogs,cwugs58,5,t5_2qhhk

5656185,0,t3_3sl55e,I guess my question is going to be what are you looking for in a dog? Are you prepared to never let your dog interact with people? Are you orepared to never bring the dog to social outings to never go to a dog park? Why do you feel like a dog with human aggression is the only choice? These types of dogs need to go to extremely knowledgeable homes one where the owner takes all precautions and is prepared to deal with negative outcomes. Are you prepared to have your dog put down because she bit someone? You can take all the precautions in the world but you need to look at the severe negatives too.Personally I would not adopt this dog but I am also not knowledgeable about training a human aggressive dog and I have no experience with it. If I adopted a dog and it developed aggressive tendancies I would have to become knowledgeable and I would do everything in my power to be the best owner for my now aggressive dog but I just would never outright adopt a dog with this inclination.Maybe you are prepared and can be a great home for this dog I do not know  do you want to get a dog ASAP is that why this is an option?Honestly this dog is not far off from being a danger.

5674527,0,t3_3st1hb,A Staffy for firsttime dog owners? Holy shit... good luck. Youre going to need it. Great dogs but you need to be aware of dog aggression their exercise requirements and their strength.You need to start working on his resource guarding immediately. Drop treats for him every time youre near him while he has a toyfoodboneetc. Dont think of it as rewarding bad behavior think of it as associating you with great things in his mind while hes working on a toy or his food. You need to start this right away because resource guarding can quickly escalate into dangerous behavior. Growling while youre handling his leash is probably just insecurity some dogs are more vocal than others about their displeasure. Still please be careful. These are very strong dogs. Remember dont punish dogs for growling or showing teeth. This leads to biting without warning.The peeing is pretty normal for a dog whos been in a shelter. Even a short time in the shelter is enough to undo housebreaking for a time. You need to treat him like a puppy. Get him on a schedule. Start crate training him. If hes reactive about the leash he may be reactive if you try to lead him into the crate and may be reactive when you let him out. Again be careful. You dont know this dog. As another person said keep him tethered to you when hes not in a crate he shouldnt be wandering freely.The panting is probably just stress. Normal for a shelter dog. How much exercise is he getting too? These are athletic dogs. They need a LOT of exercise especially when theyre younger. Running exercise such as running with youalongside a bikewith you while youre rollerblading is necessary. Not getting enough exercise is not good for their mental health and Im sure he didnt get much if any in the shelter or rescue. Remember not to get him exercise around strange dogs such as in a dog park Staffies are prone to dogaggression. Even if the shelter said hes not thats based on very limited tests with a limited number of dogs and not the same as taking a dog to a dog park where hes running loose with other canines.And if theres a fight even if your dog didnt start it hes going to be blamed and you will likely be on the hook for vet bills.

We already had a french bulldog so the majority of this dogs youth was partnered up with our other little buddy. They gets along great with each other and weve brought them to the dog beach a bunch and the pitbull was ecstatic playing with everyone. As of recently the two of them have begun despise any other dog they see especially when theyre on leash. They lash out and bark incessantly. I feel as they transition into adulthood a pitbull begins to see things differently and react with what seems like fear. Were combating this by going on frequent walks when he sees another dog from a distance we make them sit down and give them treats if theyre chill. Slowly we are moving them toward being able to pass other dogs without reacting at all. Training a dog is life long,dogs,cx6zsxh,1,t5_2qhhk

5735979,0,t3_3tns89,I work at a vets office so this is how we do things on our end. You will have a conversation with your vet ensuring its the humane option. It sounds like you two have already reached an agreement so they will probably have you skip to the paperwork. It sucks but we like to do it first so its out of the way. I always offer to run a card at this time so you dont have to potentially wait on me. We require a catheter if you want to be present to make sure everything goes smoothly. We would borrow him for a short period of time to put it in sad owners make it more difficult to do our job since were only human. Once thats done take as much or as little time as you want. I will interrupt the vet with a client because euthanasias are our number one priority.The euthanasia itself is an overdose of anesthesia so he will not feel pain and its over fairly quickly. Dogs that are not comfortable with being restrained will fight it but generally that does not happen. Sometimes they lose control of their bladders which is normal. Afterwards take as much time as you want to say good bye. Generally people with large dogs opt for cremation so you will leave him in the room for the staff to take downstairs.

All samples from the most recent dog food survey  that tested positive for pentobarbital as well as a subset of samples that tested negative were examined for the presence of remains derived from dogs or cats. The results demonstrated a complete absence of material that would have been derived from euthanized dogs or cats. The sensitivity of this method is . on a weightweight basis that is the method can detect a minimum of  pounds of rendered remains in  tons of finished feed. Presently it is assumed that the pentobarbital residues are entering pet foods from euthanized rendered cattle or even horses.Straight from your article... Every link was straight speculation.

However Sig was completely untrained and in many was essentially still a puppy so it has been more difficult than I expected.Definitely consider how well trained your first dog is since dogs can sometimes backslide when a less trained or unhousebroken dog is brought into the mix. Make sure your current dog meets the new dog and that their personalities mesh well. Consider how a second dog will affect your lifestyle. When we only had one small chill dog we would bring him with us to barsrestaurantslow key parties etc. but now with two we stay in more often or go out for shorter periods of time so as to not leave the dogs home alone too long.

5831684,0,t1_cxk0kjg,Well its complicated.  There are foundation breeds and breeds from several breeds being mixed.  There are lines within breeds.  When you start mixing breeds you automatically lose some markers.  So maybe a chow looks like xyz markers and a Chihuahua looks like xxz.  You lose one market and they are suddenly hard to tell apart.  Thats very dumbed down and simplified but I think it gets the point across.  The computer doing the analysis looks at all the markers does some complicated statistical analysis and comes to the most statistically likely conclusion.  It doesnt mean its right.  If the owner then comes back and says the dog is  lbs  clearly its not a chow.  Thats when a human can look at the info and apply the other info.They are using the same techniques used to do other cool things like calculate how closely species are related and how humans traveled out of Africa.  This stuff is how they proved the theory that Europeans have Neanderthal DNA.  Its really cool stuff!  But its not cut and dry.The results arent sketchy.  Send them a purebred dog without telling them what it is and it will come back correct.  The more breeds you throw in the mix the less certain the prediction is.  However the more markers they add the more certainty can be achieved.  I believe they are set over  markers now.

Growing up my family always had dachshunds and one day our youngest doxie was getting out of the car after a ride somewhere and the jump out of the car onto the ground ended up messing up her back.

As for the parties a dog cant be at a party the end. Its a way to exciting environment for a dog this is really dangerous even if it is an old ass very sweet dog shit happens children are assholes towards dogs and the shit happens.     As for the euthanising the money that you would spend to kill him go to a positive reinforcer trainer some are shit other good enough other very good go to ones that work with aggressive dogs usually are the ones that are very good find a pitbull  fb group of your countrycity and ask around.    Dogs are animals animals kill its not that big of a deal for him what you will need is to correct the aggressiveness and dont let it escalate.

5933987,0,t3_3wn6xt,Crate training is overrated in my opinion. It could give the dog kidney issues if they are crated for too long with a full bladder. I just teach mine to give me a signal that lets me know he needs to go. Labs are pretty trainable so youre in luck. Pick out something you think the dog will be able to do easily bark whine paw at you come to you and sit preferably something that will wake you up at night. For me I just waited until my dog yawned and made a whine noise. Immediately after I heard that I ran him outside to pee. I didnt even need to give mine treats or any praise when he went but he learned to howl or whine at me to go pee. But for you you should give treats when it goes outside to pee to get her to learn a bit faster. In my opinion this is the best way for me and my dog but some people swear by the crate method its all personal preference. Edit I was wrong about the kidney issues. ,dogs,cxxh5jj,-14,t5_2qhhk

I know the PetcoPetsmarts have classes that focus on eventually passing the CGC for less just not sure if theyd be worth it even for the cheaper price? A lot of the class curriculum seem to focus mainly on the obedience aspect so I am hoping I can get a trainer to help us more with the handling portions of the test. May I ask how you worked on getting your GSD to the tolerating state? What we have been doing is having new people treat or throw a ball for her but she decides when to allow touch if at all. Its been a slow process so far.EDIT Also noticed that one of the shelters in our area offers shy dog classes do you think this might be more what were looking for?

5951824,0,t3_3wxx3f,I got my pup from a breeder in Alabama who had been working with Boston Terriers for  years. I found her through the parent club but still I was a bit nervous about buying from a breeder because you never really know who they are even if you meet them in person. I had ruled out ones that were closer to me because they didnt really look legitimate so I committed to driving  hours one way.She had a waiting list that was like  people deep and I was pretty bummed about having to wait but I still went through with the interview via email and got a copy of her contract to look over. Pretty standard.  yr health guarantee  lifetime return should I not be able to care for the puppy at any point in her life. All puppies received their first vaxs microchipped  and were properly wormed and on preventatives. Mandatory desexing by  months of age and vet visit within  days of taking puppy home. Pretty normal stuff. I could find the health check online with her parents names etc etc. No shipping because she wanted to meet people in person  avoiding the risk of a brachy pup on an airplane. Things that I would consider being responsible I guess.I was able to ask at anytime anything about my puppy and she sent regular pictures and videos to show how my puppy was progressing. I was also able to tour her kennel and see all of her dogs my pups parents  grandparents and they were so sweet and wiggly and full of kisses. I was so excited I nearly burst into tears when I picked up my little girl and she kissed me right on the nose.Now that I have my pup I still email her pictures and updates and shes always so happy to see my puppy growing up. Luckily despite so many people being ahead of me I was a good fit for one of her little girls and I took my baby home on Halloween about  weeks old. Overall Im extremely happy with my situation. No rescues that served my area would adopt out to anyone under the ages of  so I had to give up that route or wait a year and a half.Here is a before and after from about  weeks to  weeks old.Shes gotten so shapely.

5955672,0,t3_3wzuia,I have to say after the first  days with one of my dogs I was ready to give up too. I actually called the dog rescue I got him from in tears because I could not handle his  lack of housetraining WE JUST WENT OUT  MINUTES AGO HOW ARE YOU STILL PEEING?!   insane energy I swear he was super calm an relaxed during our first meeting and home visit  whining for food I know youre not starving to death STOPHowever the dog rescue group I got him from has a policy that you must keep the dog for at least  weeks before returning unless its for a serious reason like the dog bit you. The reason for this is that before that they dog is still majorly adjusting to his new home routine and you!  days really isnt enough time to fully understand your girl. I am so glad that I waited the full three weeks because he really did get better over time. It really can take months to fully adjust and I swear he wasnt completely adjusted for the full first year. The issues you mention are actually pretty minor issues but heres my  centsFor the submissive peeing I would go back to the housetraining basics and take her out every  hours. If she is still peeing its possible she has a UTI or a bladder problem so you should see a vet to rule that out. If its truly submissive peeing it should get better as she gets used to youher new life more. For anal gland issues since shes been completely uprooted and had worms! shes probably having a bit of diarrhea. This makes anal gland issues much worse. Try adding a spoonful of canned pumpkin to her meals just pure canned pumpkin not the pie mix with the spices. This  cured my other dog that had anal gland issues when we first got him.I dont really have experience with playbiting I leave that to others.If you really dont think you have time for this dog or you just dont click after  weeks you should give her back. However getting a blank slate puppy will definitely not work as puppies are about x more work than an adult dog.

I dont think its either insincere or dishonest to indicate that the scientific evidence is inconclusive. Note that Im not saying that the lack of scientific evidence proves that pit bulls are safe. Rather Im saying that the lack of evidence indicates neither that the breed is safe nor that its unsafe. Personally I think its more disingenuous of Merritt Clifton  and by extension DogsBite.org  to imply that unscientific evidence news reports proves that pit bulls are unsafe.As I indicated in the comment to which you responded I think the data collected by the Star demonstrate that leash amp muzzle laws are effective but not necessarily that breed bans are effective. So I dont believe that getting any additional level of evidence breed identification which you indicate isnt reliable and isnt going to happen is required since this Star article seems to suggest that leash amp muzzle laws were equally effective on banned breeds pit bulls and Staffies and on nonbanned breeds Rottweilers amp GSDs.,dogs,cy3pf0u,2,t5_2qhhk

She had never shown aggression inside our home before now and thats what scares us.I think she has just always lived with a heightened level of nervous fear that is finally starting to wear her down.We will of course get her checked medically prior to making any decision but I would be very surprised if anything physical showed up.,dogs,cy6hk56,-1,t5_2qhhk

6006131,0,t3_3xq8x8,As someone who works with dogs I have never needed spanking OR scruffing. Teaching incompatible behaviors and heavily reinforcing those with management to make doing the wrong thing impossible so it doesnt get inadvertently reinforced and become habit is my answer for most pet manner problems. Works a charm with my dogs my coworkers dogs everything from serious behavioral cases to hyperactive sport dogs and the hundreds upon hundreds of other dogs that come through my workplace. We never say no I cant even remember the last time I used that word to a dog. I wouldnt even worry about conditioning it. A cue like leave it would be far more useful. Ill also go there and say that I was never spanked as a child and the studies dont show much favorable about it for kids either. Its just not necessary. It seems to be reinforcing to the person to spankyellscruff giving a little it of adrenaline and I accomplished something she knows she did wrong nowI showed herthatll teach her which is very invigorating compared to having a clicker and working through boring behavior reps. ,dogs,cy6xnip,3,t5_2qhhk

6011466,0,t3_3xqlk3,He pulls in a direction? Thats your cue he wont get there. Note that youll need a lot of patience and your walks will be very very short at the beginning. Also you need to be able to grant him space and time to roam offleash.So he starts pulling in a direction. You stand still until hes at your side again. He gets a treat  good boy and you move on. He starts to dart ahead again you stand still again. If he wont come to your side  back to you you turn around and walk the other way. You need not backtrack for too long only until he tries to get ahead again. Then you can promptly turn around once more and head in the original direction.Eventually you slow down to a standstill if necessary if he walks ahead of you until hes by your side again then you resume normal pace  start walking again.Basically whenever he does something you dont want for example walk in front of you you dont reward it. He has to learn that in order to get what he wants to get over there to get attention to get a treat he has to let you set the pace.The stricter strict as in consistent you are the faster hell learn. However dont start too demanding. At first its probably OK to only demand he doesnt choke himself or pull at the leash. Restrict the radius you allow him in front of you. Also while on the leash playing with other dogs etc. is not allowed. Thats reserved for when hes off the leash.Another thing you might add is to force his attention. Basically when he looks you in the eye you encourage it with a treat  good boy. You can also start coupling it by giving a look at me command whenever he does it anyway so he starts connecting the words with the action. Now to the force his attention part You had to stand still because he was pulling on the leash again. Hes already learned that he now has to return to you before you walk on. However from now on he also has to look you in the eye before you walk on. You can also have him sit after taking him off the leash until he looks you in the eye before you allow him to roam if he obeys a sit or stay in such a situation or he has to look you in the eye before you unleash him.Worked for me.,dogs,cy7msfw,2,t5_2qhhk
6014116,0,t1_cy7tabd,gt I have recently adopted a dog that is mouthy bouncy and super hyper. What type of classes did you take your dog to? Regular obedience classes or behavioral classes?If youre asking about my MILs dog I had her sign up for puppy classes. She was in class with dogs who were about  months old while she was a year old. After six weeks she went into a basic manners class for another six weeks. She was pretty diligent about working with her dog and doing the homework the trainer suggested. About a year later she took a basic agility class but that was a huge flop due to her inability to find the time to do any training at all with the dog between classes. However even with that by then the dog really was pretty good about being a good girl. Part of it was that she grew up a bit and part of it was that she wasnt in a crate all the time. But a big part was that just those  weeks and then the later  weeks of classes made a difference. Behavioral classes? Other than special classes for reactive dogs thats really not a thing. If your dog is bouncy and mouthy and has lots of energy odds are he needs exercise and some boundaries. id sign up for basic beginner classes and start making sure that hes exercised every day. ,dogs,cy7z87m,2,t5_2qhhk

6041690,0,t3_3y8yjz,My SO and I are looking into Sammies and we live in Massachusetts.  Weve done a good bit of research so far started networking in the region and have had discussions about the traits were looking for since we want to make sure we will be getting a dog from a line with a temperament that is a bit more biddable since I would love to do more obediencepossibly therapy work with the dog.  We have a sortof biddable terrier so we know what its like trying to proof behaviors with an independent dog and the uphill battle we face trying get her to comply.  Getting the dog as a puppy and really driving home recall and training is your best bet with independenttype dogs although you wont be able to run with it until it is a bit older.I think a Samoyed would be a great fit for you.  Other spitz breeds you may want to look into are Keeshonds and American Eskimos  theyll be a bit lower energy but more biddable. Lower energy dogs arent bad since you can train their endurance up  our  lb dog hikes and runs!  For a different kind of fluffy but with higher energy levels Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers Bearded Collies and StandardGiant Schnauzers could fit the bill for sure.,dogs,cybkqaw,3,t5_2qhhk

6121948,0,t3_3zatxb,Have you tried changing the time of day you walk your dog? I have a very reactive chihuahua mix and my next door neighbor has a reactive beagle. Both dogs are fine with each other in the backyard through the fence but neither is good when out on a walk. I walk my dog when theres less traffic outside. I wait until  to walk her when most people are at work. Ill let her in the backyard as soon as she gets up but I like to walk her again to make sure she works the poop out. I wont walk her between  because theres so much walking traffic due to school getting out. At night I walk her at  when most people are done walking their dogs. My neighbor is about  minutes behind my schedule. I ask because it can be hard to avoid all dogs all the time. Last night I took my dog out and saw two people down the block with two dogs so I crossed the street before my dog could see them. It worked well enough for her to do her business but then she immediately saw them and went bonkers. What do these people do? Cross the street so theyre closer to us and start walking in our direction. So I cross back over. Im getting closer to them but tough for them. My house is two houses down and Im going inside. I know its not cute but I do everything I can. I walk her when most people arent. If she needs to go she goes in the backyard. I direct her away from other dogs.

I didnt notice until we went back inside that an old Indian couple were waiting in their car the whole time at least  minutes too scared to get out until we went back inside. I remember feeling bemused but not upset at all.From what I understand its a cultural thing. Dogs are considered unclean and even if you have one as a pet it stays outdoors.

A tired dog is a happy dog and a tired dog doesnt cause problems. Be advised that Flirt Pole I linked is strong enough for my  pounder but neither toy survived her wrath. The one made by Squishy Face Studio  is higher quality and the toy holds up fantastically. So far the only issue weve encountered is the toy gets a bit dirty but thats nothing that cant be easily solved.

Has the breeder offered you a different puppy from the current litter or a planned future breeding? Most deposits arent refundable but if you placed it after inquiring about this specific puppy you may be able to convince them to refund it. I will say in defense of the breeder that until you have the puppy or have paid in full and have a contract written and signed for that puppy its not yours.

6360492,0,t1_czcke7r,It took awhile for our dog to get it  we started with something easier like a slowfeeder bowl This is the one we use for our dog  the little purple tabs that slow the kibble from coming out can be cut and adjusted so the ball can be made easier.  The first ball we got for our dog we cut many of the tabs off since she was a bit of a slow puppy.  We bought her a second one a few months later and only cut a tab or two off making it way harder than the last ball.  Since the treat ball is a pretty cheap toy its easy to replace when you need to make it more challenging later ,dogs,czcm841,1,t5_2qhhk

6383492,0,t1_czf80qq,Honestly what has been most interesting about this is seeing how many people think I was calling on some sort of prohibition on letting small people have dogs.  That and the people who think I am calling for something like not allowing females to have big dogs.  All I ever said was vendors including breeders should be more cognizant of the issue and do a reasonable and limited investigation into the issue.  That could be as simple as asking the  lb person who wants to adopt an  lb dog hey have you ever had a dog before?  Do you know how strong a dog this size is? Lets take a walk and see.  How are you going to control a dog this size?  I think if the person cant give satisfactory answers to those questions then it is a problem and it is a problem that can be avoided then and there by requiring the potential owner get a different dog or undergo training to offset the disparity before they are allowed to get the dog.  I dont see what is so unreasonable about that.  Something you are totally right about is that no amount of postadoption coaxing can force the owner to follow through.  That is the issue in the first place.,dogs,czf8ga0,-1,t5_2qhhk

Reward her if shes good. Ignore if shes bad or correct if youre part of that school of thought. Sit far away from other dogs so you can fully control the situation. ,dogs,czi52u4,3,t5_2qhhk

Even just writing it all out relieves a little stress because you know someone else is listening and it lets you destress by talking. My baby was sick a lot as a puppy and it was just consistently getting stung by bees and going into anaphylactic shock giardia that wouldnt go away eating a burrito! She was literally  pounds when it happened and the burrito was placed so high I still dont know how she got it. It had onions in it so that was another crisis. Shes had a few stomach issues a pinched nerve just small stuff thankfully.

He walked and drove around looking for Sandy. But pressure to get to work he has to go. He made calls to friends but dogs not know to call a shelter. Suprisingly enough many people just dont realizeHe did not call Tina knowing shed be beside herself and frantic driving the distance back with car full of kids. Had he called her shed have told him about checking shelter.When she arrived home found out went to shelter she was told Sandy was adopted out. She pleaded in tears for them to call adopters and ask for her baby back . They refused.Left shelter empty. Called and pleaded with manager once again to be hung up on.So she started actively with social media desperately trying to get adopters to see this. Shes had Sandy for  years. Sandy is family.Tri county shelter turned down interview.

Couldnt be possible because it was never included in the billdiscussed. Ill be asking them why the paperwork is inaccurate when I call in. I understand now not bringing it up on our December appointment but when we were there in the summer oddly no mention of it.Edit I called the office and it seems like they screened for it when doing the bloodwork for her surgery only they never communicated it with me. They arent recommending another visit for another test until May since it isnt mosquito season here. So for now I suppose I will wait as per their instructions.

I live in an apartment complex and theres a lot of green space in the parking area and around the buildings where I let my dog sniff around as he pleases beforeafter walks around the neighborhood. One day he stopped in front of one of the buildings and was smelling all around in the grass and bushes and some old hag starts yelling at me from the th floor window. At first I just thought she was lonely and trying to make conversation so I call up and ask if shes talking to me and she yells back Where are your manners? Take him to do his business in the storm drain! which IMO isnt a good way to handle your dogs poop anyway I looked up at her and shouted Do you see him pooping? Do you see him peeing? Hes smelling the grass! Hes a dog he needs to smell things! but this woman was clearly old and probably senile and has probably been stewing about dog shit around our residence for a long time but instead of taking it out on the people who dont pick up their dog shit she decided that I was a good target because Im a small skinny chick and she felt like she could get away with it. She kept repeating to me over and over to take him to piss and shit in the storm drain and clearly explaining to her that my dog is JUST FUCKING SMELLING THE FLOWERS was NOT getting through to her. Finally I got so fed up with her I yelled to her that she can piss and shit in the storm drain if she likes I clean up my dog shit I own my apartment I pay my residence fees and I can walk my dog on the property as I like just as she is more than welcome to walk around the property as she likes. She called me a bitch and I said Same to you! Have a nice day! and walked away. I really should have just pretended I couldnt hear her yelling at me in the first place but honestly I was so worked up that I felt like I had to defend myself and my dog.

Theres a lot of people that think any play other than smelling amp sniffing is bad and then you have some people that dont pay any attention whatsoever and their dog terrorizes dogs and humans in the park. I used to go all the time but I got fed up with people not the dogs. Now I just have dogs come over and play virtually on a daily basis for at least an hour so Sammy gets to play with bigger dogs as well as smaller dogs.

The reason in our case was that he had some intestinal trouble. He threw up once had a bit of diarrhea and I am suspecting that had something to do with too much protein in his diet at that time we used to give him some proteinrich treats that the vet had recommended now no longer. To cut the story short while he felt nauseous he did not want to eat almost anything but would eat some rice boiled in chicken stock if offered.

Even a  minute leash walk barely takes the edge off. Your dog is bored. You need to get him a dog walker or doggie daycare. Trapping him to catch him in the act isnt going to help you have to address the underlying cause of his behavior. He should be sleeping and maybe chewing a bone in the house. ,dogs,czx6or0,13,t5_2qhhk
6553631,0,t3_45dgln,Dog trainer hereHes not getting nearly enough exercise and stimulation so hes creating his own fun. Theres no point in telling him off when you get home because he wont connect the action to the reprimand. He knows youre upset but his simple doggy brain cant connect the action he took hours ago to whats happening now. The guilt is just him trying to placate you. Theres really no point in punishing him at all for this since its a symptom of boredom and not defiance. Generally speaking punishment is only effective when used to curb disobedience. Destructive behavior is another beast entirely.Im going to be blunt with you His breed is designed to pull sledges in harsh environments not sit around a suburban home all day. This destructive behavior is your fault because you are not fulfilling his needs. Hes not trying to be an asshole hes just trying to expend his energy somehow. You are going to have to increase the effort you put in and give him at least twice as much exercise as youre already giving him.  minute walks are definitely not sufficent for this breed it doesnt matter if they accumulate with several walks a day. All youre doing is warming him up getting him ready for a big adventure and then leaving him hanging. I suggest you find some way of giving him strenuous prolonged exercise every single day  perhaps he could pull you on rollerskates or run alongside your bike or even run on a treadmill. Your goal should be to get him panting and tired after every outing. ,dogs,czx7654,27,t5_2qhhk

I have a couple of suggestions though.. Keep her away from the rug. Xpen roll it up and put it away during the night confinement in a puppy proof room her crate etc. .

IT is a dog right. Not a person. It can go into a crate with a treat to chew while you shower cook or relax for a bit. If it fusses in the crate it stays until it is quite. Same for the play yard.

While we were walking through the entrance to the complex park I walked right into a spider web with a huge fucking spider in it and dropped the leash as I struggled to get it off. This was just enough time for Scout to see a Maltese off leash on the other side of the hedges and run over to say hi which startled the poor little guy. Fortunately she rolled onto her back so she didnt look too scary but the owner was still pissed with me for having my dog off leash. I felt so embarrassed that I had dropped her leash over a spider like a fucking idiot and apologized profusely.

6660133,0,t1_d085kwy,gt  too many people dont train their chihuahuas properly.You got that right. We adopted our chihuahua  years ago when he was fiveish and apparently he had been in a handful of homes that wanted to adopt him before us but everyone returned him back to the rescue because he was snarly and badly behaved. When we first got him for the first month he didnt really act like what we now know is his true personality. He would sit in his bed ALL DAY and sleep and if you told him to do something he didnt want to do like get off the couch he would fullon snarl at you and act like he was going to bite you. He was also leash reactive.He sort of terrified me at first because he seemed unpredictable but in retrospect he wasnt even all that badly behaved. His aggression actually stemmed from fear and once we spent some time working with him on basic obedience and rules he turned out to be such an awesome little guy. Took me forever to teach him to sit though  weeks  longer than any foster Ive even had  Ive even taught young puppies to sit faster than that. I honestly dont think anyone had ever taken the time to try to teach him anything like that before. Once he got sit down though he was able to pick things up fairly quickly. People are always surprised and delighted when he does tricks for belly rubs. Also people that dont like small dogs have told me they love him.... So what people need to learn is small dogs are dogs too! If you treat them as such they can actually be really well behaved.,dogs,d087r1m,1,t5_2qhhk

6709946,0,t1_d0dbgfu,Yeah I have no idea how specialized the breeding may be for meat dogs but Ive raised chickens and the meat breeds are VERY different. They have a certain target yield pounds of meat and a timetoslaughter some number of days after hatching and you absolutely cannot and should not keep the bird alive past that time. They literally put on so much mass gotta have those plump chicken breasts doncha know that their skeletons will deform and break and they will die slow painful deaths. I should add that I never raised meat chickens because I didnt feel up to the task of doing so humanely. I actually question whether producing these animals isnt inhumane from birth. I know some people object to perpetuating the more physically extreme dog breeds but boy howdy are chickens another thing entirely.I dont know much about dogs bred for meat I imagine theyre not quite that physically extreme but socialization is probably another big issue. If theyre like other industrially produced livestock theyll be crowded into cages or pens and completely unsuitable for home life.,dogs,d0dd6m4,6,t5_2qhhk

I found that the best method to teach a puppy that biting and growling is not a good way to play was time outs.  Play with the pup in a room closed with a baby gate.  When he bites stay calm and say no leave the room for  seconds.  Repeat while slowly increasing the time I didnt go over a minute.  I found that more repetition was more effective then longer time out.  When the puppy plays correctly licking biting toys etc he gets a treat.  Good luck!

6780359,0,t1_d0kk9cb,Well thank you!They are recognized as a breed by a few groups though I cant remember off the top of my head. Ill edit this when I find them later. Its important to note that some people think NAID and Indian Dogs are the same. They are not! Indian Dogs are a breed created to mimic dogs that were used by many Native groups particularly plains Native Americans. The widely accepted story behind NAID is that a breeder was breeding wolfdogs badly. Wolfdogs became illegal in her area so she had a large cull and killed off all but a few who were lowcontent who she then bred. A little more mixing and she had what she called Native American Indian Dogs.Truth is you probably dont really want one. Its a very mixed bag because there is no real standards set. Some have huge fluffy coats and are outgoing some have a big shorter coats and are shy. Some are actually very lowcontent wolfdogs and will be hell on earth for the average owner. I ended up with my girl Tjeajte not knowing she was a NAID. Had I known and been educated in her likely behavior I probably wouldnt have adopted her. She is a huge escape artist and cannot be trusted in the yard alone even with  foot fence at her main escape points. She hates to be alone to the point that when she is alone she destroys the house. I cant leave her in an outside kennel because of said escape problem. I built a kennel for her in my yard and she broke the fence broke into my porch trashed it and then jumped the yard fence. I chased her through my area upwards of an hour on an almost weekly basis before I got the current system set up because I was dumb enough to trust her and look away for a moment. Im about  on if she is a lowcontent wolfdog.TLDR NAID are becoming a more recognized breed but the breeding is generally bad. You probably dont want one because they are a huge mixed bag at this point and can be very hard to handle if youre unlucky. If youre extra unlucky youll end up with a lowcontent wolfdog who will probably be hell on earth for you.If you still really want one I dont know of breeders on the West Coast. I know there are business that pick up puppies and do a sort of transport train to the buyer. Its pricey though and I dont know of any by name just heard of people using them. I wouldnt suggest buying without meeting the puppy parents and seeing the place first though.,dogs,d0ku6dr,7,t5_2qhhk

I mentioned Ive only had him for a week and I know that its nothing. I was just curious if anyone who had gotten a pup before who wasnt potty trained had any advice just based on their personal experiences. Im trying my best to figure out his schedule and how he operates. Its just been difficult because he didnt really have a schedule before. Im not purposly comparing him to my previous dog. I know that every single dog is different and they learn differently and such. Ive just never been in a situation before where someone allowed their dogs to do these things so Im not sure how to go about training.

It calmed him down a little enough to make some progress with obedience but it was around the  year mark that he really chilled out not to say hes a calm dog now but he is no longer like Taz the cartoon . If youre decided on the little dude read everything you can about the worst case scenarios that can happen with this breed especially him being a male and make concrete action plans if any issues arise. Expect him to develop dog aggression at some point of his life. Be very consistent with his training one slip up will set you back and focus on basic obedience because that will help out tons in the long run sit and focus helps us deal with his reactivity the most.,dogs,d0m5cp3,2,t5_2qhhk

My guys are absolutely wonderful! I honestly have nothing negative to say about them I may be a bit biased.

We bred and interbred and crossbred different dogs until a set of useful or bizarre standards were met and then decided THAT particular grouping of dogs constituted a breed.

Like not perceptibly weird to anyone that doesnt really know him but he was in his bed and the way he was lying in his bed was completely unusual for him he almost looked like he was trying to hide something in his bed with his body. So I mention this to Husband who says No hes not hiding anything hes just lying differently. I say Im not saying hes ACTUALLY hiding anything Im just saying thats what it looks like. About a minute later Husband goes into the kitchen and calls to me Baby I know what secret the dog is hiding So I go into the kitchen and find a sock on the stove one stove grate knocked out of place and a pyrex dish of pasta that was left halffull on top of the stove when we left now moved off to the side and completely empty. Apparently Dog felt we didnt feed him enough before we left. I completely spaced on the pasta Im not usually in the habit of leaving food out in the open Dog got lucky tonight. Thank god he didnt knock the dish onto the floor I can just imagine the fucking massacre we could have come home to if he did and the dish had shattered into a million little glass shards I guess this will teach us to be more vigilant lmao.,dogs,d0ozdrz,1,t5_2qhhk

Hell love any warm home with loving people.gtIs it going to be a problem having a slightly different feeding schedule on weekends? No a couple hours here or there wont make a difference for an adult dog but you might need to feed him  times a day to keep a healthy weight and blood sugar.  Tiny dogs need frequent feeding.  He looks close to lbs though so  might be fine.gtDo you agree on the temperament assumption that I made earlier? You never know with strays but its a very good sign.  I rescued a stray GSD that was super timid shaking all the time just absolutely terrified.  She turned into the happiest bounciest most rambunctious and loving creature Ive ever seen.  Dont make any character assumptions yet but he looks like hes got a lot of love to give.   And of course congratulations and good luck!

6824740,0,t1_d0psrgt,Again your mileage may vary but they tend to be dogs that you dont want to leave alone for too long they get bored easily they can be prone to anxiety and since theyre high energy and very alert they can become destructive more easily than say a shih tzu. Youll need to keep one very occupied when you leave. Ive also heard that they can be harder to train.Of the breeds I have met a Boston Terrier could be a good fit theyre very trainable and much more adaptable imo than a MinPin or a Greyhound. You mentioned you preferred rescuing and here is some adviceinsight I can give you coming from finally adopting a dog after several months of looking. Of course your mileage may vary.Id keep visiting shelters and develop a kind of profile for the type of dog you want it sounds like you already did a lot of the work! and keep a few breeds in mind. You might as I did meet a very sweet companion breed that doesnt look aesthetically too frilly silly or fussy for you and who you just click with. Keep a few absolute requirements such as quietness for example and stick to them but try and keep an open mind expect it to take a while anywhere between  months and a year unless you get very lucky. As people have mentioned before companion breeds tend to suit most people who want a companion and emotional support best and tend to be better suited for apartment life even though theyre usually far less aesthetically pleasing to me than a lot of the bigger noble looking breeds. Ultimately more than any other considerations you want a dog that will best adapt to you lifestyle and space. It seems you want a very quiet dog that can live in an apartment and keep you good company without going crazy whenever it meets a new obstacle down the road. Though you should obviously find your dog cute its easier to compromise on looks generally than it is on general temperament and exercise needs. A beautiful greyhound I cant keep happy will stop being cute to me after a few weeks whereas a weird potatolooking pug that just loves hanging out with me will grow on me over the years.Most dogs will become very attached and loyal too you when you adopt them regardless of whether their breed description uses to word loyal often and will pick up on your moods. An overly sensitive dog more than a sensitive human can be a bad thing since they can develop anxiety and become reactive... and become among other things very loud. I think you might be better off focusing on finding a companion breed and looking for quietness suitability for an apartment and exercise needs. ,dogs,d0pvt2z,2,t5_2qhhk

Hounds are usually very social dogs bred to be run in packs. They are also super smart so expect to be outwitted lol! You probably knlw this but a tired dog is a happy dog and a dog bred for running hours upon hours in search of game is not gonna be physically or mentally satisfied after a walk around the block. I rescued my first redtick at  months and kept him on leash until I could trust him at  years old even though I live in a huge national forest.During that time I focused on a look at me command and rewarded heavily every.single.time. he responded to his name wherever we were. Even now I would never let henry off his leash in certain situations.  A hound s recall WILL never be like that of a herding breed or lab but thats ok.

The problem isnt lower income people getting dogs but irresponsible people that think they are entitled to the joy of a dog just because. The best one can do is educate people the younger the better on the full responsibilities of pet ownership including all the possibilities of dog expenses and all their options. Yes you can buy cheaper stuff use low income vet services etc but its ALWAYS best to highball expenses in a just in case scenario for any budgeting purposes  I am a cost and projection data analyst I would never tell a client oh well you can save there and here so lower your forecasted cash needs for this year  No no no thats just a nice get at the end of the year but should not be built into the plan!

6889774,0,t3_4a3dka,I think part of it is that adolescence is considered a part of puppyhood. Adolescence can start as early as  months. Also at the training facility we go to the owner who taught our puppy class as well as our teen class was very very upfront about the fact that sweet puppies will turn into assholish adolescents who wont listen to you and that continuing to work with your dog is a must especially because so many dogs in the United States are given up between eight months and a year and a half or so.On the other hand I think that part of the reason that adolescent dogs are given up so often is because unprepared owners fall for adorable little puppies and they excuse naughty puppy behavior because of their sweet little faces and then they start growing into real dogs who arent tiny little things and then they stop forgiving them for bad behavior. Basically I think puppyhood can act as a buffer.I dont remember that much about when my first dog except for that she was crazy and I didnt care because she was the answer to my dreams was young but my current dog is such a good and chill dog and she has always been that way. She had a very short period of time from around  to  months where she seemed like she was on the verge of developing some truly obnoxious habits like counter surfing and then she just didnt. So even though I think she has been a super easy and good dog her worst moments were definitely in adolescence. ,dogs,d0x9ujq,2,t5_2qhhk

When the instructor is talking I play watch me and look at that to keep her from just staring at the dogs. Take it as slow as you can. Usually classes put up barriers if one dog is really just not happy. I think they would definitely do that at a reactive dog class! I bring a mat for her to lay on as her place and get her to settle on it. Took one full class time weeks for her to lay there for the in between times.I gotta find me one of those around here.

6916475,0,t3_4af6qr,I think its one of those things to just keep in mind all the time when you are training. Remember to train less and play more.After all toy drive is just an extension of play. So play often and have fun and you will keep it around.Dont stress too much about control until you start moving towards needing it but work it into play gradually. That said I dont like getting bit personally so I have pretty clear rules around teeth to hands while playing.I really like Silvias work here she is quite good at this stuff. She talks a lot about remembering to treat toy like its prey and remember you can always use a leash or a rope tied onto a toy to add a bit more excitement to it and to solve the party of one problem. ,dogs,d10b08y,3,t5_2qhhk

I admire the people who do it but it does do more than never being involved and complaining from the outside. Showing is as expensive as you want it to be. You could exhibit locally twice a year for  you could exhibit in the UKC first and primarily do sports. You dont have to campaign a difficult dog but it is important that good dogs are seen. Change is a slow process in the dog world but dogs like Rumor win even though they are quite moderate. Ive seen patterned afghans win a lot natural eared Danes finish tailed rotties finish smooth Salukis win big. Now if there was only one smooth tailed natural etc dog of its breed exhibiting it probably wouldnt finish. Because people are embracing these differences from the show ring norm there are winners among them. They become more normal. ,dogs,d13l6aa,6,t5_2qhhk

If you own your house good if not then you would also need to check your lease and talk to your landlord about running a business from home. You will have to pay taxes and keep track of payments etc. If all that checks out then Id get business cards and give some to the rescue and your aunt to distribute.

Make sure your houseplants arent poisonous to dogs your cleaning supplies cabinet closes well and theres no glass or pottery waiting to be smashed into by a tail or frolicking paws. And anything with sentimental value is out of reach.  Might wanna be careful about the litterbox though.  Some dogs find them too tempting if theyre within reach.. A curtain rod or PVC!  It seems a lot of people here are saying theyve never seen an adult dog into cables.  I hadnt either until a few years ago a friends adult dog chewed through my laptop cord right off the bat.  Better safe than sorry in the beginning I think.. Ehhh... probably not for an adult dog unless hes really fluffy and would be at risk of his fur slipping into the outlet if he leanedlaid against the wall.. At his age hell prolly either already know the trash is off limits and it wont be too much of an issue or hell know the trash is full of delicious things and it will take serious training and effort to keep him out of it constantly in which case I would just set him up for success by putting it under the cabinet or up high. . Good question to ask your fosterrescuehome checker but I wouldnt worry about it prehome check.  Mention that youre willing to secure them and ask if hes shown any interest or ability in opening doors crates or cabinets before. Also side note you might want to try moving the cats food now.  After we moved my cats food to higher ground he spent like the first two weeks throwing it down on the floor.

If no potty first time bring in keep on leash by your side and go back out in  minutes repeat til potty. Water on a schedule offer water once every hour with meals and right after playing and then take outside to potty. Crate when youre not home and or when you cant keep your eyes on pup.Also when you are home keep pup close by in the same room even use a thin long leash or piece of string since its a chihuahua for the first  weeks to make sure you keep constant supervision with him  Ignore accidents in the house at worst show pup the accident immediately put on leash tell them go potty outside and take them outside and remind them lets potty. Association is key with crating and supervision you are able to avoid accidents wen youre not present. dogs typically will not potty in a crate or den especially if youve made it a positive area they dont want to soil where they sleep. This helps ALOT. Use a good enzyme cleaner to clean your carpets or favorite potty spots in the house. For a few weeks try to not let them free roam keep in confined to an area where you are by either blocking doorways or get long  ft leash or something to keep on your hip so you have to keep eyes on which one youre dealing with.Potty training is ALL about schedule routine consistency and management on humans part.,dogs,d1eh3z7,1,t5_2qhhk

Things like water therapy may help but depending on the severity could make things worse  so ask your vet about that too.No stairs or any kind of jumping or running should be done right now as they can make the problem worse.,dogs,d1fbku6,1,t5_2qhhk

7195509,0,t3_4e0mq1,Some of your answers to the questions are contradictory Im afraid. You state gtI am not interested in any particular breed. I will consider any breed that meets the other parameters. Im also not looking necessarily for pure breed or the like. Im asking about breed and looking into breeders because I want the greatest likelihood of finding a puppy that has the right attributes for my family not because I have a particular concern about purity or lineage. But also gtMy preference is to go through a breeder. In general I like to carefully weigh things before coming to a decision on anything that entails a commitment so I prefer the predictability of a known breed. Going through a reputable breeder  purebred in general there are no responsible breeders of crossbreeds. And if you go through a breeder focusing on lineage should be one of your highest priorities. Responsible breeders ensure their lines are healthy and that their puppies lineages include dogs that are the best examples of the breed.As far as a breed recommendation goes what about a French Bulldog? They dont need too much exercise but still require regular walks every day are very cuddly and affectionate trainable and familyoriented. They do shed but not excessively. They are a brachycephalic breed so the potential of requiring surgery to correct issues that come with brachys is there feel free to ask if you dont know what this means. They are a very popular breed right now so finding a noncrappy breeder will be of the utmost importance.Edit whoops didnt see that your youngest is a one year old.

7195956,0,t1_d1vzb62,gtFirst we need to know what type of breed youre looking into. You can always start at the American Kennel Clubs website. They have a list of responsible registered breeders Sorry  had to fix that for you.The AKC and other kennel clubs like the Canadian Kennel Club have a list of breeders who are registered with the club but they may or may not be considered reputable. The kennel clubs provide guidelines but do not have the resources to actually enforce those guidelines. There was a puppy mill recently seized in Langley British Columbia that was a CKC registered breeder. The better way to find a reputable breeder is to determine which breed you want and then seek out the local breed clubs for that breed. Breeders are usually a pretty closeknit group and are active with their breed clubs so youd be more likely to land with a reputable breeder rather than a back yard breeder this way.,dogs,d1w4dhe,3,t5_2qhhk

My instagram facebook and snapchat are pretty much all animals . Mostly dogs but also cats bunnies and rats. Also my dog has her own instagram account. All of my clothes have treats and poop bags in them. And theres pretty much always something that gets washed.

So for that reason I honestly think its fine to leave that question out especially if the OP puts how much time theyll dedicate to the dog honestly in the questionnaire.,dogs,d20t28z,3,t5_2qhhk

He doesnt understand that fetching isnt complete until toy is in my immediate reach or even hand. So basically my dog plays halfassed fetch where I have to fetch too. He thinks that bringing toy somewhere about  meters around me is good enough and if explained to bring it closer uses his nose to nudge it lazily instead of carrying in mouth like he did for rest of the distance.Feels like his brain goes long distance  bite short distance  nudge....as I wrote in first post. I might try stepping backwards sounds like a solid advice.

7270010,0,t3_4ey2vz,Its about ish for a lb bag of premium dog food for my  lb dog and she finishes a  lb bag in about  weeks so its about  a month.  We have fed Fromm Acana Orijen Solid Gold and other brands that fit our dogs macros and allergy restrictions she cant have chicken.  Depending on the food she eats g twice a day weighed out which is why we can stretch it so long.   She does superwell on higher protein food as well so more often than not we get grainfree food because thats where we get higher protein numbers although not always.Our foster dogs are what take up the most money since we buy larger bags as we foster larger dogs.  If we buy food for them we normally get a  lb bag of Taste of the Wild or something similar.  Since most of the foster dogs more often than not are being fed cheaper food or whatever is donated we use our best judgment.  Often times premium foods might be too rich or be the wrong formulation when their tummies are used to something else or we have them for too short of a period of time so we are okay with just feeding what we have and telling their adoptive family what adjustments to make currently we are using donated rescue food that is Merrick and we managed to get a bag of Orijen before that or buying food from clearance sections of an acceptable grade  our foster puppy who is eating over  cups of food a day is getting a  lb clearance bag of Nutro Puppy Food that was  at our local Petco.,dogs,d24jtuq,1,t5_2qhhk

Then after a while I played tug and threw it...success!!! Hed race after the toy!! Then just drop it and walk away but it was a start.

I think if I were carrying super high value not just to me dogs I would have more concern. Or if I was going to some larger event where people knew dogs were going to be unattended in vehicles for spans of time. But most of the stuff I go to it either so far out in the boonies that passerbys just...arent a thing or is in an area where cars are close to the building and everyone can kinda keep an eye out for each other to an extent.

7323348,0,t1_d2ak5h3,A lot of people are surprised to find that coonhounds are awesome pets since theyre also excellent working dogs and thats what the vast majority of them are kept for. But theyre just really great pets for active people and its so gratifying and fun to train them because theyre so smart.In terms of their behavior Id describe them as having a work hard nap hard philosophy. They can go out and hike run or track intensely for hours but when you get them inside they just want to curl up with you on the couch. The typical coonhound is extremely affectionate and loves to be around people and also really enjoys toys and spending time with other dogs. For example my coonhound might spend an afternoon quietly sitting around the living room playing with her toys then might take a nap and snuggle with our other dog. Then she goes for a long walk or run in the evening or goes to the dog park and plays allout. But then once shes done running shes totally done and will spend the rest of the night sitting on the couch with my husband and being a lb lapdog. In terms of specific breeds youll hear a lot of opinions about the differences between various coonhound breeds but honestly I dont think theres really an enormous difference other than in terms of appearance. Other than Plott hounds theyre all descended from the same original breed and if you DNA test a coonhound a surprising number of them turn out to actually be a combo of two different coonhoundfoxhound breeds. The kind I most commonly see kept as pets are Treeing Walker Coonhounds and theyre also by far the most common.,dogs,d2am4lz,2,t5_2qhhk

And its also worth noting that the ones who DO still might not have a great relationship with them. Kids are energetic often struggle with boundaries and are usually just...unpredictable. Dogs dont like that.That being said most shelters and rescues if thats the route youre looking to go will require that the dog meet with the kids first so you can gauge that before you bring the pup home.

I have one chihuahua who now has no teeth all eventually had to be removed and one with about half of her teeth. Its not uncommon with toy breed dogs unfortunately. I think the cost can vary a lot.

I know its a lot of money to some people but its also a drop in the bucket compared to the annual cost of dog ownership even for a small dog who doesnt need that much food and is lucky enough to be totally healthy. I really wish that more shelters would charge at least slightly higher prices or at minimum have a longer application or require some form of reference. If nothing else at bare minimum requiring people to prove that theyre really allowed to own a pet just bring a copy of your lease or some evidence that you own a house for example and evidence that they have the money to pay for its basic needs would go a long way toward preventing adoption by people who absolutely shouldnt be adopting at that time.,dogs,d2mg8n2,3,t5_2qhhk

Since my gf is on an island I called the vet and he called the small doctors office where she is. They provided some form of medication for him although being stuck on the mainland Im not exactly sure what the prescription was. Shell be coming back on Wednesday night so well bring him to the vet then but it seems like our vet is confident that the meds will hold him over for the next couple of days. Thanks for the advice.

I did this in January and I was worried about the husky acting out in response to the puppy or generally just totally hating her. It generally has been fine  he loves the puppy but there have been some behavioral issuesregression into some crappy behaviors we thought had been trained out of him. For us that meant he was back in the crate during the day for the time being hes almost four and has been free range since . and we try to give him more individualized attention than he got prenew puppy. I do think those behaviors will go away when she is older and stops being such a pain in the butt but its something to watch out for  particularly with very smart stubborn working breeds.

7494240,0,t1_d2t9akf,you can only do what you think is right. i understand your frustration and agree with your decision. at the end of the day some dogs just need different owners. the bulldogs might not be able to have a happy life living in the apartment complex being walked only by a group of adolescents but hopefully there is someone out there who is able to give the dogs the proper home and routine to help them overcome their issues. on another note and this is me venting about MY dog i am someone who owns a dog with aggressive tendencies towards other dogs. he is a german shepherd. he has been attending the dog park from  months old and socializing since then. maybe i havent gone about it in the right way but my point is that people do make the effort to raise their dog the right way and sometimes it is just out of their control. im a relatively big dude so its never really an issue for us on the leash because i am very stern and i make sure to correct my dog when he shows any signs of aggression towards other dogs. at the same time it is not always easy to train a dog out of those tendencies. obviously the adults involved in your particular case could be more proactive but i guess my point is that its unfair to judge the kids for this when they are probably only doing what their parents tell them to. ,dogs,d2u1zvv,3,t5_2qhhk

He wrecked at least two of my dolls when I was little mom made damn sure I knew it was MY fault for leaving them on the floor.  My friends didnt like him some were scared of him. He made things difficult sometimes. I still loved him a lot though because I didnt have to deal with the serious stuff. But when I got sole custody of him a couple years back I was very frustrated with him because of his lack of training and hyperactivity. But since about a year ago weve really grown together I wouldnt have wanted to end up with any other dog. Hes the best companion and has a lot of great traits. The moments that made me really realize how much I loved him were  the time we were walking with my moms friends formerly abused and fearful pit mix and some kids came up and asked to pet moms friend was anxious and asked them not to because he wasnt super trustworthy then and without thinking I just went to them with Max and said here pet Max! and felt this like swelling of pride because I knew I could trust him to look out for kids and help his doggy friend feel safer and  the time a year back when a toddler escaped his mom ran up and threw his arms around Maxs neck and lost his balance and went dead weight Max took it in stride and just looked up at me kinda concerned and waited for me to get the kid off and return him to his very embarrassed mom.It takes time to bond with a dog and it can feel disheartening because everyone else seems to have this magical connection already and you feel like shit because you dont feel that way yet.

This is great as they are dedicated space just for dogs but obviously there is some risk to having numerous dogs offleash in one area depending on the parkdogsareaetc. We have a ton of very large  acre wooded fenced in parks we go to regularly for some offleash running.Although I will argue that if your dog is well trained having it on or off leash is hardly any different. I have a high energy dog that is never offleash outside of offleash areas and we focus more on traininggamessports than running offleash. Where I live there are tons of people and traffic  letting your dog off leash even if well trained is extremely dangerous. One delayed recall could cost them their life. Even when I lived out in the country we lost a very well trained dog to a car just by bad luck. There are not a lot of area that are completely open in the states unless you live way out in the middle of nowhere so it is very hard to safely take your dogs offleash. We take huntingbird dogs offleash for workinghunting. But for urbancity life it is safer for everyone to use a leash and that is not at all a detriment to a well trained dog who is otherwise getting their mentalphysical exercise each day. Running also does next to nothing to our dog. He sleeps it off in an hour and is ready to zoom around again  he really needs a good deal of mental stimulation to not go nuts.,dogs,d2ud2xa,11,t5_2qhhk

It is NOT your fault though I totally get how youre feeling. I wonder if your dog just gets overly excited or anxious or nervous when you or someone new comes home and simply doesnt know where to put that energy. I hope that your vet or behaviorist is able to help you interpret your pups body language and make it past this! As suggested its really important to try to focus on figuring out what the switch is and avoiding that trigger until you have a management plan in place. In the meantime you can use timeouts bathrooms work great to give your pup a place to settle down and learn that that behavior is not okay.When hes mouthy is the biting hard or is it more playful? My dog does this nutty thing where he lays on his back wiggling all over the place and puts his mouth and teeth on anything he can get his jaw around. Its definitely a playful intent as he thinks its the proper way to play but obviously as a big dog it isnt safe. Were working on training him that this isnt okay nor is lunging at us when were holding a ball he wants and how to safely play in all cases and slowly hes getting it. We also thought some of my pups undesirable behaviors were him just having bad behavior but it turns out he has some pretty bad anxiety so what he actually needed was gentle voices and calm body language to show him he didnt need to freak out.Just remember this isnt your fault and youre going to make it through this!!,dogs,d2zbdbq,2,t5_2qhhk

This will be a  person job for sure.  Have your friend get them to use the doorbell  or know knock but use them all.  And the second he barks  distract him with fun or love.  Eventually itll turn to background noise for him and he wont care. Or you can honestly turn it into a game. When someone approaches the door  have them find a toy.  Work on distracting and finding a fun toy.  Then have the dog learn to bring the toy to the door  and offer it as a gift.  This way  you can get him to still see whos at the door  but in a calm and good mannered behaviour. I hope it works out but it can be done.  And Im sure theres many other ways of going about it.

7655674,0,t3_4k5uql,In my opinion it sounds like either breed would work for you. Both breeds will probably alert bark someones at the door etc. but if they are exercised and mentally stimulated via training and puzzle toys I dont think youd have any barking issues. They would both probably do better with two hr walks but that also will depend on the individual dog. Some dogs like to go on multiple walks per day and others are good with one walk and some fetch.,dogs,d3ceoh9,4,t5_2qhhk

I dont have experience with agility training but Im sure it can be done...hes been on  mile runs and as I said they are very smart. They used to be circus dogs and I think can learn up to  words or something. Another big reason we chose an eski is because they are a very healthy breed with no significant issues they can live past . Also theyre super cute and fluffy. ,dogs,d3cioy1,0,t5_2qhhk

You could also try putting the toys in a ziploc with a really smelly treat  something fish based or rollover treat rolls or something like that! Dogs have a pretty great sense of smell so as long as the toys go back in the bag every couple of days I would think it would be enough.

7662254,0,t1_d3cnefk,What you store it with depends on what youre willing to sacrifice you could fry up a piece of bacon or throw in some blue cheese. A peice of smoked salmon would likely also scent a dog toy heavily. I also bet an over ripe banana would add scent if they were stored together at room temp for a few days  I know I can smell banana on my food when packed in my lunch box haha! Vanilla and peppermint are great ideas  Maple seems to be a popular one with the dogs I work with. Just remember to dilute with water as theyll be really alcoholy and strong smelling at full strength.,dogs,d3d5kvv,1,t5_2qhhk

Try to remember that any dog no matter how much it seems to fit the expectations you have on paper will have its own personality and quirks. A lot of what you have listed as ideal traits can be contradictory to one another. A large mellow low exercise threatening standoffish non energetic couch potato lap dog  with a sweet affectionate personality and longetivity can be a tall order.Edit I may be wrong but I can say no dog Ive ever had can meet half those traits let alone all.,dogs,d3dy3uz,7,t5_2qhhk

7683504,0,t3_4kkbf6,It sounds like youd do very well with a Poodlethey shed very little often dont trigger allergies it would be best to meet some beforehand to make sure youre comfortable around them and theyre generally happy calm pets. Another breed that doesnt shed much is a Schnauzer. Both breeds need regular grooming but you mentioned thats not an issue so I think theyd be a good fit.If youre looking for an adult dog youd probably be best looking in rescues or at adverts for dogs being rehomed. although internet adoptions are often shady Youre more likely to come across mixes in a shelter than purebreeds so it would be important to spend some time with the dogs to find out if they irritate your allergies.,dogs,d3fkfjx,2,t5_2qhhk

The howls make other dogs bark far off. Across the street are two small dogs bark at people. That has been a regular.  Im not sensitive in my dog barking cause thier are regular dogs barking in the niegborhood. Another across the street has two big dogs barking at passerbys. I like the security of these dogs barking. But when my dog barks at a crazy women seeking revenge  she might legaly find another way to rid of my dog cause she barks at her  being so close to her,dogs,d3gnwqx,-4,t5_2qhhk
7695117,0,t1_d3gtojq,Our dog was a rescuerehomed actually a little unique situation. Long story short a young man s who had some family connections to a fairly reputable breeder in the state bought a puppy for his  year old girlfriend. They broke up and she hid the dog in the barn on her parents farm for about  months and then we saved him!!! He was just at  months when we got him and had some serious behavioral issues from being under socialized and untrained for months. We tracked down the breeder eventually though and got him in ship shape hahaha. So we joke he was our clearance puppy because we paid  bucks for him and the breeder sells her puppies for around  grand someday I want to buy him a distant relativeBut as for exercise we got him at  months so it was just walks fetch obedience classes etc since we didnt want him full on running until he was old enough. Now that hes  an average day for us is an hour walk in the morning before I go to school he will either be home while Im in class Im in law school and my fiance works full time or spend  hours at doggie day care. Then fetch or Frisbee in the yard and another hour walk before bedthere are  dog parks within  miles of us all within walking distance so we walk to those usually. We have at least  days of training per week which depending on the course take anywhere from an hour to three hours then he usually runs around the facility after for a few hours they own their own dog park and pool. On weekends when the weather is good we hike all day hikes so hes beat haha and at least once a month we go to my parents farm and he runs the pasture all day hahah. We also just started herding classes nothing competitive just to satisfy his drive so we will spend a few days out at the facility with the sheep. We also spend a solid  minutes working on his obediencetricks and currently we are building up to a solid recall so someday we can be off leash. And every night when we plop on the couch hes a massive velcro dog so he sits on my lap and demands at least an hours worth of pets before bed haha haha. And after all that hes never tired but hes not destructive. Sometimes he gets bored and we have to play some pretty intense tugofwar or give him a puzzle ball but otherwise hes a happy camper. ,dogs,d3gvvai,1,t5_2qhhk

7727852,0,t1_d3kl7ck,The difference between different coonhound breeds is a common topic of discussion in coonhound groups and theres always a lot of debate about it. Some people strongly believe that there are notable differences in temperament between the different breeds while others insist that its just about the individual dog. My opinion tends more toward the latter but in terms of what people say about the difference between the two breeds you mention a lot of people say that Black and Tans are more coldnosed able to follow an older trail than Walkers and a little more methodical in their tracking. Then people would say that Walkers are a little more into running and also a little goofier in terms of their personality. From the dogs Ive personally know this sounds pretty reasonable to me but I honestly dont think that theres really a big difference especially if you dont have a desire to hunt with the dog. ,dogs,d3klp16,3,t5_2qhhk

Its just been too long and all the normal home remedies I think most of us would recommend have not worked.If I had to guess Id guess that its a combination of having gone too long without using the bathroom making her backed up  shes either still in pain or fears that squatting down will cause her pain. But either way I dont think you can count on this issue getting fixed without going back to the vet.Once this immediate issue gets cleared up Id recommend talking to the vet about whether regular pain management may be needed. I might also see whether she will be willing to let you help support her with a sling when she goes to the bathroom which is something that can be really helpful for large dogs with an injury or pain problem in their back legs.,dogs,d3m1fun,1,t5_2qhhk

Id been using furries long before I learned about the latter. With my partner I also use the doggers and catsies.People have challenged me on the use of my dog as denoting ownership. I explain that I use it as one would my brother or my mother i.e. neither indicating ownership or exclusivity.I dont like guardian either! I find it stuffy and I dont want to be lumped in the same category as others who use this term Im weird enough without being considered an animal rights extremist.gt I dont like to outcast myself too much I do hear you on this.

7841476,0,t3_4mofc9,When I was in middle school and home sick my younger siblings were getting on the bus for elementary school with about  other kids with one mom watching on. Our neighbors had  huge black mix breed dogs and one was well over  lbs and the other was about  to . As soon as the last kid got on the bus those dogs Maggie and Shadow ran up and attacked the mom Shadow the big one eating her bare thigh and Maggie destroying her arm. And I say eating on purpose as it was like a shark bite when they were done and she had a large piece of her thigh missing and they ate it. I was watching from my front porch since I was home and I ran in and got my dad who was sleeping as he worked night shift and called . The mom almost died from blood loss. Our neighbors didnt even own leashes and always let their dogs roam free as they didnt want to to fence in their yard. The bus driver couldnt help the mom because she was afraid of possibly letting the dogs near the kids and she was trying to console the moms kids. It was just terrible. The neighbors fought to keep their dogs and actually got to keep them after a quarantine. But after a couple years of having animal control called on them every time they let them out they gave them up and they were put down.,dogs,d3xg7sr,4,t5_2qhhk

Most of my skepticism is because shes too young and doesnt really look too much into the future. Of course Id help her out but I just dont think shes ready or emotionally mature. I probably came off really harsh especially since she has epilepsy but Im just venting some likely irrational anxieties. I kind of think huskies are easier since Im so familiar with them but I get that most people think they are harder than GSDs. The difference is maybe that GSDs need a lot more mental stimulation whearas huskies need lots of physical exercise. But Ive never had one so correct me if Im wrong. Also GSDs are considered a large breed and huskies are pretty small so it would be big difference to what were used to,dogs,d3yp2nu,2,t5_2qhhk

He is turning  in a couple of weeks and is the most stupendous dog I could have hoped for. The thing is as someone who hunts well Im pretty casual myself but we wanted a bird dog because my partner is an avid hunter I literally cannot deal with people who insist that breeds are AWFUL and USELESS and SELFISH. We required a bird dog so we got one! Any random dog cannot do what my dog does. If you need a dog to do a job breeds make a hell of a lot of sense! Because he comes from hunting lines my dog has always quartered beautifully and knew immediately to honor another dogs point  literally on his first upland hunting trip.

Since breeding on their own definitely doesnt involve people picking their mates..The possibility of a faulty gene turning up is definitely something thats been around since canines Ill agree with that. Hip dysplasia has been found in wolves and coyotes after all. In order to get the benefits of being a mutt suppressing negative traits youd definitely need more than just a few generations. When I said multigenerational I certainly didnt mean just  generations! It took a long time to breed our dogs into their current states of inbred unhealthiness it would take more than a handful of generations and under  years to reverse it.I dont really pay attention to downvotes.

As a result the breed has a large share of incredibly shitty breeders but also has a lot of good ones too  they havent been driven out of the market. Also Bostons have maintained their reputation as one of the healthier brachycephalic dogs despite their popularity.

7968328,0,t1_d4bnljw,They are such tough choices you sound so thoughtful and I know youll make the right one. Its such a challenge to make decisions for another living creature who cant clearly communicate and so easy for us to secondguess ourselves.For Syd the spleen rupture was very sudden. Hed gone on a pretty normal walk that morning though he was a bit slow but it was also early September and so kinda hot even in the morning. Anyway I happened to notice that he was shaking a little later. Not anything like a fullon seizure but slight trembling. That was all  but it seemed slightly off so I called his regular vet and dropped him off for an exam for when they could get to it. They called me within about twenty minutes and told me to take him to the emergency vet so I went back picked him up and did that. From what I learned at the ER most dogs hemangio status is discovered precisely this way through some type of emergency event. Syd clearly had a tumor that had caused the rupture but we had to wait a few hours for a biopsy to confirm. If it had been cancer there wouldnt have been anything to do for him. As it was he amazingly had some other type of tumor unrelated to the lymphoma so they went ahead and removed his spleen. One thing to think about is whether you prefer inhome euthanasia. We had kind of planned on that for Syd once we knew he had lymphoma and ended the chemo but we thought we had at least a few weeks to plan so that didnt end up happening for us. If you want to go the inhome route you wont be able to wait for an emergency event and youll need to make that decision earlier. I will say that our ER experience with him was a first for both of us in terms of putting a dog to sleep. Wed both assumed it would be cold and sterile but actually it was very loving and caring despite the context. They piled a bunch of blankets on the floor and gave us plenty of time with him and when we finally left one of the techs stayed with his body so he wouldnt be alone before cremation preparation. In retrospect we were both glad he didnt die at home so we didnt have a constant memory of his last moments associated with a room in our house. At the same time I have a lot of friends for whom the inhome experience was really wonderful too so its just another variable to consider as you decide.,dogs,d4bprwg,2,t5_2qhhk

I wish I could upload a picture of the broken metal clasp the bar and the spring that keep the clasp closed and hooked to the collar are completely gone. I cant figure out how it happened since she is well under the weight limit that the leash was graded for. It looks like the metal surrounding the bar bent outwards allowing the bar to fall out and unhook from her collar. I have my local police dept telling me since they have leash laws even though she was leashed and it broke that Im completely liable for her vet bills and Im also liable for any damages to the drivers car if they decide to come forward! They wouldnt even let me file a complaint for the driver leaving the scene of the accident! That blew my mind! I feel like they are just reinforcing this behavior. The driver didnt stop or slow down to see what they hit they didnt know they hit a dog it couldve been a child it was my child! I was told through the grape vine that the incident and plate number got called in and the cops wont even put me in touch w the driver to see if they want to help with her recovery costs which were over  plus . interest rate on a care credit card since it happened on a holiday and only one vet was open and it was an emergency clinic!

8227347,0,t1_d55lhdb,Wow.  Glad to see you are getting downvoted into oblivion.   This sounds like a dog that does not get enough exercise stimulation training and possibly not enough attention either.  MOST dogs are going to be nightmares when that is the case.  They are going to be a lot more prone to behavioral issues yes including biting.  They are dogs after all and require training.  A dog that bites is not necessarily indicative of a fundamentally aggressive dog.  Many are just displaying aggressive behavior due to a lack of training and exercise.  And thats on the owner .   If OP does decide to put this dog down which is ultimately his choice it is completely irresponsible to suggest he get another.  He needs to do some basic research into dogs their needs and their behavior before he even thinks about bringing another dog into that home.  ,dogs,d55z3l5,2,t5_2qhhk

8229380,0,t3_4s06e1,Giving her back to the rescue or putting her down may not be the only options. If your contract with the rescue allows you could make an effort perhaps with the assistance of your trainer andor vet to find a more suitable home. If the contract doesnt maybe you could arrange a deal where you have to approve the new home. I absolutely get that youd feel like a failure or terrible person for giving up on her but your story shows that you arent. As a person who fosters for a rescue the rescue absolutely should have been more upfront with you. Their job is to lay out all the issues and do everything they can to ensure that dogs dont go home with people who may not be able to handle them. They did not do their job. It sounds to me like youve tried just about everything and are ready to call it quits bit not ready to admit it. It is not your fault that this isnt working out. If you are done trying look into rehoming and know that shed bounce back from the change.If you want to keep trying my dog can only eat fish or alligator!? Who knew they make alligator dog food!? no poultry or beef. Id try to set a nice consistent routine maybe tough right now with kids on summer break.... Working on training would probably help too. Itd give her mind something to do besides worry. We use carrots at our vets recommendation with our allergyridden dog since so many treats cause flareups. More exercise would be nice. I saw an article a while ago about letting dogs choose which way to turn when you reach a corner on walks. Giving her choices like that could potentially help with her anxiety. Make sure your kids understand her issues too and have a good understanding of her body language so they can recognize her anxiety.,dogs,d56894c,1,t5_2qhhk

Her dog sounds reactive on a leash at the very least whether it is fear frustration excitement or aggression would need to be determined by the owner andor a professional.As for the situation it could very well be that your dogs dont get along and her dog is fine with other dogs. If shes already there Id make note of the time and avoid her schedule. Now if her dog is universally aggressive or in most circumstances you should be able to report to the governing body of that park. If your shots are up to date you should not need another.

8269075,0,t1_d5b4t4f,What I said doesnt somewhat answer OPs question as you allege it completely answers it. The question was Can anyone advise me on the best way to rehome this puppy. Place it in a rescue in particular a BC rescue since these dogs require an extra level of ownership commitment.  Most breed specific rescues will be very well equipped to handle and place a pup particularly BC rescues. I cant recall ever hearing of a badly run BC rescue which is promising. I did state multiple times in multiple comments that attempting to recoup costs by selling the dog was unethical and that rescue would be the way to go. This is true regardless of what you think of my word choice. I dont give a hhhhhhhoooooot about whether its a lot of money for someone or not. I care about the animal in question period. It should be devastating to give up a young puppy! Anyone who didnt have a hard time with this shouldnt be a dog owner. This isnt an inanimate object were talking about its a baby living being that OP intentionally sought out to bring home. OP asked about the best way to rehome the animal and thats the advice I gave. Its been suggested numerous times in the comments. I never said Im a BC expert nor the most ethical person on the planet but I am a lifetime BC owner and therefore have some first hand knowledge and also an animal rescue volunteer with multiple organizations thus experience in this realm also. Calm your tits. OP states she sought out the BC pup because it was a breed she always wantedlusted after  I cant help but feel that someone so interested in this breed should have been a little bit more knowledgeable on what to expect and how this pup wont be the right fit for a lot of homes they may be able to find for him personally. Your attempt to insult me with enjoying the taste of your own medicine? seems not is trivial. Im very obviously not stooping to the level of insults. I never once said anything personally about OP or you just about the choices that were made which were by consensus OP included not great. What is good is the recognition that the pup is too much to handle and now I am recommending that to continue with this good choice OP place their dog with a breed specific rescue. I care about the young BC who is going to be moving homes and about ensuring that hes placed with an owner who understands the yearish commitment a puppy entails and decade plus commitment a border collie entails. The points Id also like to emphasize are puppies are not impulse purchases border collies should not be acquired without serious consideration and reflection on the capability of the owner to provide sufficient accommodation for the breed type  rehoming is often best left to a competent rescue organisation and recouping costs by selling your dog is unethical and likely not to work anyway one of the repercussions of buying from a byb is not being able to get a refund and being left with the task of rehoming. These are takeaways for anyone who may be looking to purchase a puppy and this story should serve as a warning tale for the occasional heartbreak that can come from underestimating this situation.    End of Story. ,dogs,d5b6xww,1,t5_2qhhk

8272656,0,t3_4snxtq,Im a little late but I have two Border Collies and I love them to death. I honestly didnt know much about them when I got the first one. My girlfriend loved them as a child so I just went with that. We got the second shortly there after. They are awesome. They are very high energy but not mental at all. We let them out to play in the morning at lunch we work close to home and after work. Then we usually go on an hour walkrun after dinner. For the most part theres not much that separates my dog from most others. They did go through a few phases though but nothing out of the ordinary chewing digging destroying toys. I think the only thing theyve ever done that I was floored by is when they destroyed an entire mattress in  hours. I had an old futon mattress that was going unused so I set it up in the garage as a giant dog bed. It was great for  months or so. They loved it. Well one day I came home and opened the garage to find futon stuffing covering every inch of the floor. This is a two car garage so they did quite the job spreading it out. On clean up I realized that they tore it apart so much that you couldnt tell where the mattress was to begin with. That was a little over a year ago and there havent been any instances since.I never thought the breed was a handful until I came to this sub. I dont know if I have two great BCs or what.

8317563,0,t1_d5h869t,As far as aggressive behavior the dogs lunge at people passing by our past relations with the owner were always pleasant.  We always got along in the past. I have bought their kids presents and looked the other way when their kids did things out of the ordinary of like like smash glass bottles in front of my yard. Boys do things like that and their kids are otherwise not bad kids. A little background another neighbor had one dog that was a little dangerous.  That dog jumped the fence attacked my old dog and paralyzed him and attacked my mom not bad but it shook her up.  We spent two years and multiple surgeries nursing my old dog back to health.  Thankfully that neighbor got rid of the dog.  I am still good friends with the neighbor and I dont harbor a grudge.  I dont hate dogs.  I was always concerned about that dog but that dog is nothing like these two dogs.  these dogs are in another category in terms of size and aggressiveness.  In addition they are not fenced inthey roam the front yard all day unsupervised.  I dont understand how people can be so judgemental about parents but not dog owners.  If my kids are unsupervised in the front yard for a minute I am a bad parent but if someone leaves an aggressive dog in the front yard  hours a day unsupervised they are great owners.

They can not be removed even the dealer didnt know how the dogs trip over them one of my dogs injured a foot on one you cant put things on them like boxes or grocery bags etc. My dads Sienna was an earlier model that did not have these it had a flat unobstructed floor after removing the seats.

My push for him to be neutered is not based upon behaviour I desire for him to be neutered in general!Honestly I do not know when this started. My mum generally doesnt tell me what happens on his walks with her and everything was grand. There was an instance the first time I experienced him attack another dog intact male English Bull Terrier which for me would possibly be the moment that I noticed this behaviour. Both dogs were introduced whilst on the lead neutral territory and were fine together whilst they walked on the lead. We then decided that they were friendly enough for Gus to be let off lead EBT was not let off lead and Gus attacked him. I feel that this is hormone based bit as a whole I feel that the situation is a mixture of hormone dominance and dominance that is fear induced? As in if I dont attack you first youll attack me kind of way?I have heard that in some cases that castrated males tend to be more reactive and less tolerant of intact males!

He never was much for wooing the ladies before but he lost interest completely thereafter. The only behavioural change that I noticed was the one I mentioned in my OP  he became more easily irritable and started to pick fights with his brother kind of the opposite of what you expect from a neutering. We did take a testosterone test after  months to see if it worked and it was basically at zero.From what Ive heard chip neutering isnt  safe in terms of preventioning unwanted pregnancies.

8424006,0,t3_4uy9zu,If puppy raising doesnt make you crazy and exhausted either you are a saint or your puppy is. It is a lot of hard work.An exercise pen on an easytoclean surface is a lifesaver. At  weeks theyre too young still to be able to hold it long enough to tell you when they need to go  theyll just go. So as well as having a schedule for taking them out if you also keep them in an area with papers that is easy to clean up with natures miracle or another enzyme cleaner itll really help.At the same time you can work on getting them used to their crate by having the crate in the expen area for them to sleep in. Use a divider so that its only big enough for them to lie down in and make a potty area at the other end of the expen.Once hes about  months old hell be able to hold it long enough and youll have spent more time getting him used to the crate so instead of leaving him free in the expen youll close him in the crate inbetween pottyplaytraining times. As soon as he comes out of the crate go straight out to potty onleash even if you have a fenced yard and keep him in one area until he goes. Then have a treat party let him offleash to run around a little and then go back inside for play and training. If he goes again when youre inside make a note of the time interval. Then when youre actively doing stuff with him youll take him out at that interval and give him a chance to go. Once playtime amp training session is over one last potty break and then back into the crate and hell probably take a nice nap. As he gets older and doesnt need potty breaks as often you can start letting him hang out with you outside of the crate. Still dont let him wander out of sight  keep baby gates up so that you can keep an eye on him.Bring his crate into the bedroom and have him sleep in there so you can hear him if he needs to go out Take him onleash dont give him a treat or play after he goes and calmly take him straight back to the crate.

8425406,0,t1_d5uph83,That argument is only sound if we both agree that original function is an irrevocable part of breed and I do not.  That is to say we both need to agree that ability to bay lions is an essential part of what makes a Rhodesian Ridgeback a Ridgeback and without ability to bay lions then a dog who is otherwise identical to any other Ridgeback isnt a Ridgeback.  If you accept that as a starting premise then logically you also accept that you could have two Rhodesian Ridgeback litter siblings one with working ability one without but the one without working is not a Rhodesian Ridgeback despite having been born from Rhodesian Ridgeback parents and despite being from the same litter as a Rhodesian Ridgeback.Obviously thats an unreasonable position to take.  Rhodesian Ridgebacks who lack ridges are still Ridgebacks.  Ridgebacks who are blackandtan rather than wheaten are still Ridgebacks.  Ridgebacks who no longer bay lions are still Ridgebacks.What makes a breed a breed is the ability to breed true  If you take two dogs who look like Rhodesian Ridgebacks and you breed them and the dogs that come out look like Rhodesian Ridgebacks then they are Rhodesian Ridgebacks.  Border Collies who dont have the ability to work sheep but who are flyball and agility dogs are still Border Collies.,dogs,d5uptzq,1,t5_2qhhk
8425647,0,t3_4v205r,So I dont have any college experience but my brother got a dog against my moms wishes in college and heres his story. My brother and his nowex girlfriend were at dinner when they saw an all bone and skin dog trying to get someones food on the table. His girlfriend pulled the dog away and the dog went to live with my brother and his  roommates all male. He and his girlfriend shared the dog but she couldnt have dogs in her apartment so he lived with my brother. My brother worked long hours but there were almost constantly people cycling through the house. The dog gained the needed weight and much more now weighing in at  lbs but he loves pizza and can recognize the box from anywhere. They moved from house to house each year. My brother then graduated and was looking for jobs. He ended up not being able to get one for a while and needed to couch surf and look for jobs at places where friendsfamily lived. An  lb dog is not something you can take couch surfing nor is it a dog that would fit in an apartment for when he found a job so he had to give the dog to me and my parents. It was pretty heartbreaking especially since theyd been through almost  years of school. He spent  years in school. Boomer is now very happy to have a big yard and get lots of attention and hes very attached to me but he still lights up when Ben comes home and gets sad when Ben leaves. ,dogs,d5uqwzw,6,t5_2qhhk
8425701,0,t1_d5tgxrn,Yeah thats exactly the problem with some parents and their kids. They think their kid can do no wrong and that animals are supposed to act like humans and are approachable and friendly towards everyone like in the movies. Its especially problematic when they think dogs are supposed to catered to their kids and their own entertainment whenever they want. I find that kind of attitude disrespectful and detrimental to the dog. It sets many dogs up for failure because many dogs can only tolerate so much. Dogs should be treated with kindness and respect. Not a stuffed animal to be played with.  ,dogs,d5ur5r1,4,t5_2qhhk

8430526,0,t1_d5vcc7w,Okay awesome!Hmm yeah Im not sure what to do about a crate not fitting in the bedroom.About helping with nighttime potty issues your pup will be less likely to potty in his crate thats not to say he wont do it but it would reduce it and hopefully more likely to cry or bark and wake you up when he has to go.  Hopefully.  Also it means when he does potty in the middle of the night youll know as soon as you wake up i.e you wont find poop under your couch two days later and he wont be able to do it on something expensive or impossible to clean.Crate training will also keep him from destroying things when you leave.

8444649,0,t3_4vbyab,My family has had hunting dogs for as long as i can remember. And the dogs they have are used for hunting. Coonhounds have a very HIGH prey drive. They have very good stamina and can run for what seems like forever. They also have a very distinctive bark. They love to tree things so that being said if you get a coonhound be prepared for the hound dog bark when they find something interesting in your back yard. It can be a worm or a butterfly or a beetle just anything.With any dog training must be consistent and it must be started as soon as you get the dog. Make training fun and switch it up from time to time so you and the dog does not get bored of it.With potty training a schedule and patience are key... LOTS and LOTS of patience. When our dogs were young we took them out like clock work every  min or so. We would play with them making them run and things because it helps them potty. As they got older the schedule became after breakfast lunch and dinner we would take them potty. Also before bed. After awhile they got used to going outside to potty. Also with any dog that is in a household with a young child NEVER let the dog be around the child without supervision. Little kids dont understand the ques a dog gives when its had enough of a situation. I have seen little kids get bitten because the dog was tired of being played with to rough. And it turned into a bad situation all the way around.So in essence you have to train your toddler AND your dog at the same time. But no worries it can be fun! And quite the adventure.,dogs,d5x4aqq,2,t5_2qhhk

The owner put the dog in the Center and then pulled it out before Cesar ever worked with the dog. There was a court order that this already aggressive dog be either euthanised or sent to Cesar. The owner sent it to Cesars center and then pulled it out right away to save money even though Cesar hadnt actually yet worked with the dog. Cesar and his team warned the owner that the dog wasnt rehabilitated at all. I think the owner thought hed figured out a loophole to get around the court order well I technically did have him briefly in the center so no euthanasia mandated.As for the husky that would be a very wrong and harmful way to work with a dog. However if you watch the video what happens is...Cesar gives the dog a very very mild correction. The dog responds by trying to attack Cesar. There is only one way Cesar can kerp from being bitten the dog is on a leash and Cesar holds the leash up and out to make it impossible for the dog to bite. Holding the leash up as well as out keeps the dog off balance. Maybe not so good for the dog but very good for self protection. He wasnt trying to train rehabilitate or punish the dog. He was just trying to avoid being bitten. Yes maybe he could have prevented the need by utilize protective equipment more like muzzlesYou dont have to start liking Cesar as a result of me saying the above.

An experienced Land Lord who knows about  guard dogs will want to protect himself amp the apartment from angry dogs. And more  often than not want to meet these tenants hes never met. HECK  where can you even FIND a rental which will accept  big dogs but no yard? This sounds like maybe the dogs arnt on the lease or are restricted breeds and the LL is unaware. It happens a lot. It doesnt matter with lap dogs but it  does matter if the maybe the dogs could be dangerous. Im making a logical inference based on what OP said. Even if  you own your own gated  farmhousemansion The utilities guy will still  have to read the meter the Maytag Man will still have to fix the Washer. guard dog implies a level of training amp ability to control what could otherwise be a very dangerous dog. As a tenant you know Utilities Maintenance Owners rental agents will occasionally visit. It isnt a farmhouse or a mansion. I try to take off work when maintenance does there thing. But I dont blame the Meter Reader guy for wanting to feel safe around my dog while doing his job. Why cant he take off work? Why cant the LL wait a few hours?

8514970,0,t3_4wbouc,Theyre definitely old enough to understand.  If it was me I would tell them everything.  I believe I was around  when my grandmas cat got cancer and my family didnt sugar coat it.  We talked about the fact that kitty was old and sick and he was never going to get better because medicine cant fix everything so it was best to have him put down so that he didnt suffer and hurt anymore  his death was good for that reason.  It was really really hard and the first time I had to deal with loss as a kid  I grew up with that cat I loved him to bits.  But it was an important lesson and Im glad I learned it when I did.  Learning about death and loss when youre younger in my opinion is the best way to start to accept it as an unfortunate part of life and be able to deal with it when it happens.  I think the older you are the first time things like that happen the worse it is.  So my advice would be to tell them the truth the whole truth just do it gently.Regardless of circumstances its never easy sorry about your dog OP.  ,dogs,d65xhnf,3,t5_2qhhk

8552173,0,t3_4wx4vp,I would first introduce them all separately before together  youre absolutely right with  on  being a little much sometimes.  If Bonnie is the alpha of your parents two I would introduce her and Zelda first  you want to gain favour with her first because shes probably protective and possessive of Floyd if that makes sense.  At our house Cali is  the alpha of the two dogs  they trade roles in play occasionally but in daytoday life shes the boss of the two dogs.  If another dog comes to play that she already knows and is fine with no big deal.  If another dog thats already friendlier with Sunny comes to visit she can get a little jealous and might get between the two whatever.  So typically I would introduce another dog and Cali then another dog and Sunny then all three of them together.  Thats what I personally would recommend with your situation as well  Bonnie and Zelda one on one then Floyd and Zelda then all three of them together.  Since dogs tend to have a higher tendency to be reactive on leash I prefer to introduce them at a dog park etc. where they can be off leash.  I would encourage that if its an option for you but its not necessary.  Definitely introduce them on neutral ground first though before taking Zelda to their house.  Thats the most important thing IMO  dogs are generally much more reactive and protective in their own home and territory than a neutral space. To prepare them ahead of time just working on socialization and meeting new dogs will be helpful.  The more theyre used to meeting other dogs the easier it will be.,dogs,d6alfat,2,t5_2qhhk

8600836,0,t3_4xm8ku,A couple thoughts . Be patient you dont need to adopt the first dog you see. There are lots of great dogs out there but not all of them will work for your situation. Remember to keep your dreams about the dog in mind. A sweet toysized dog might be awesome but probably wont make a great running partner.. Keep energy level in mind. An understimulated dog can turn into a destructive dog very quickly. Border collies will have very different energy levels than greyhounds for example. . If you are considering a purebred dog whose breed you are unfamiliar with do a little bit of research first. . Personally I think going with a private organization that fosters dogs gives you a better picture of the dog you are interested in. Shelters like the humane society do a lot of great work but they are usually not able to give you as much information about the dogs as a private organization. As far as food goes it really depends on what you are looking for. What is your price range? What sort of things are important to you? conventional vs organic ingredient source grains vs no grains etc. If you do not want to feed your dog the kind of food the rescue is currently feeding them make sure you transition to the new kind slowly. start with  old food and  new and slowly increase the amount of new food until you have transitioned off the old brand. Switching foods too fast can give dogs horrible diarrhea. Unfortunately the stress of new environments can also cause diarrhea or sometimes dogs will stop eating until they have acclimated to their new home. Training styles will depend on the dog and what heshe responds best to but generally I think this sub prefers positive reinforcement and gentler techniques as opposed to things like dominance theory or routine use of ecollars. The studies I have read seem to point to positive reinforcement being the most effective method of training. Good luck!,dogs,d6gp4u3,1,t5_2qhhk

Your Golden may be very atypical if you believe that. Livestock guardians have nothing in common with retrievers.

They want to please you they want to figure out what the silly human wants them to do.Livestock guardians dont give a shit. They have their sheep theyre good. How old is your Golden? How do you know he has no interest in dog sports? An Anatolian will give two shits about doing dog sports. Unless its guarding sheep. Anything else? No. Thats not their thing.

The family was distraught and after waiting a few months because they thought that was the prudent thing to do they got another Maltese named Clyde.  My grandmother began to resent and eventually hate Clyde constantly saying he was a terrible dog and eventually gave Clyde away.  Thing is my mom maintains that there was nothing wrong with Clyde he wasnt a bad boy at all his only fault was that he wasnt Snowy.  A few weeks later they got a German Shepherd puppy named Duchess who grew into a wonderful beloved dog.  Because that is such a different breed here was no way Duchess and Snowy could even be compared and thats what finally helped everyone move on and heal.The GSD and Maltese breed difference is pretty extreme so dont think Im telling you to go out and get a Chihuahua or something like that but since Berners like Malteses all have pretty identical markings and coloring you may want to consider a dog with a different look to help you move on.,dogs,d6ojdmg,6,t5_2qhhk

The medication she takes for going in the car would not be appropriate it requires a strong person to come along on the car trip since the medication makes her out of it to the point where she wont necessarily be able to get inout of the SUV on her own but she is just so nervous and its so hard to predict what will set her off on a new fear spiral.

Sounds like youve found a winner. His separation anxiety will be tough to work through but if thats a problem you can deal with keep him. Every dog is going to have its issues youve got to figure out what issues you are okay working with. Also just some things Ive gleaned from yourother comments GSDs are supposed to be sort of lanky. Its hard sometimes because the breed is so popular you see a lot of variations that are a result of poor breeding. And a lot of people have fat dogs truthfully. So maybe youve got a lanky one? Talk to a vet they will be able to tell you more about it hes at a healthy weightwhat you can expect. And while GSDs do have shorter coats they have double coats. So expect shedding.

8727231,0,t3_4zke07,probably.  honestly you should find a good trainer to work with you.  The sooner you address it the better.  In the meantime ask people to ignore him.  He might get comfortable to go up and sniff them which would be good  but they should continue to ignore them.  He sounds like a nervous dog who needs to gain confidence.  You havent had him very long so he still may be unsure that you will keep him safe so try to do your best to not put him in situations he finds stressful.  Make an effort to watch and learn his body language.  He probably stiffens or something before he starts barking so I would look to try to move him in an opposite direction when you see that.

8746630,0,t3_4zrjmm,From my experience it can be hard to tell right away as issues can develop after the new dog becomes more comfortable and confident in his new home. Most import to start with is to make sure both dogs are under as little stress as possible maybe start outside and move inside. They can feel confined indoors and increase stress. Feed them separately and pick up all of the Setters toys so that he doesnt resource guard. You can reintroduce them once they are more comfortable. Take them on a walk together is a good thing to start with also and let the Setter show him around. My dog isnt much of a player and took him a few months to start playing with my foster a while back but ymmv. Keep an eye on body language and keep stress levels down and you should be good to go. The more quickly the two dogs become comfortable with each other and the new atmosphere the faster youll see how well the future will be.,dogs,d6yze57,1,t5_2qhhk

I agree the puppies in the bright white clean pet stores are another byproduct victim of this industry. But I would love to introduce her to Mika so she can see what its like to live with and care for a real mill rescue. I would like her to see what its like to teach a  yearold dog to walk on grass for the first time or to understand that she can control when and where she lets her bladder go. Her dogs have a happy life and are probably very normal but what she did is the farthest thing from rescuing you can get. She chose the path of least resistance. The typical American I want it now! attitude of someone who cant wait patiently for a responsible breeder to have a litter or who doesnt want to deal with the inconvenience of rescuing an unknown out of the shelter. ,dogs,d6zxusf,7,t5_2qhhk
8755447,0,t3_50019j,Hes gotten out of the habit is all. I suspect whoever has been walking him while youve been away parents? dont throw things for him or dont reward him when he brings them back so hes stopped bothering. As a child I suspect you did reward him by continuing to play with him after he brought something back  to be honest this is how and why most dogs retrieve balls and sticks... because they get thrown again and so the fun goes on. They dont bring them back because they are obedient or because they view you as an authority figure they do it for the rewards  whatever they may be. If you want him to fetch things again youre going to have to set about reteaching him that there is something in it for him. You do that in stages... you throw the stick and if he looks at it he gets a reward. The reward depends on the dog and what he really likes... food or pay or praise or petting. When he has cottoned on that looking at the stick you throw gets the reward you can up the bar and start to reward if he approaches the stick... then if he then touches it with his nose.... then if he picks it up.... then if he picks it up and looks at you.... picks it up and takes a step towards you.... picks it up and brings it to where you are.... picks it up brings it and drops it... and youre done!Or you can do what most of us do which is fumble our way through it by throwing the stick and fetching it ourselves while having a funny little moan to the dog  this method is very hit and miss though I would guess he would pick it up again pretty quickly as hes done it in the past and his breed makes him more likely to enjoy this behaviour. ,dogs,d7037kg,10,t5_2qhhk

My assumption was that the dogs people cant handle are unlikely to have been properly trained and exercised otherwise the owner wouldve been able to handle themIf its mainly just the exercise requirements though that makes more sense. Ill certainly put fostering back into consideration and perhaps try to be picky about only fostering a trained dog and then only judging the behavior after a few weeks of decent exercise again. The only issue is that my running ability isnt up to the level of an adult dog yet I was planning to improve my running as a puppy grew... then again I can always train for a few months without the dog first!,dogs,d70y0lu,1,t5_2qhhk

After the investigation the animal control officer called me and informed me that my dog did nothing wrong. The just of what they said was someone hurt your dog and he reacted accordingly. He was only defending himself. I believe the verdict was considered no fault. My guess is that if her lawsuit gets anywhere getting a hold of social services investigation report could greatly help you. Our encounter happened in oregon and Im sure laws differ in different areas but Id look into it all.

8792085,1,t3_50jx1p,Im... not sure that youre right for the kind of dog you want. Most dogs of the size youre asking for need much more exercise than  minutes of walking and a game of fetch. My advice would be to get a small dog or to adopt an older dog that might not need as much exercise. Cant really refer specific breeds because the sweet pliable ones tend to shed or need a lot of exercise.But off the top of my head I can think of the Labrador the Golden and the Dalmatian. Keep in mind all three need a lot of exercise and training as they are large and high energy breeds. Dalmatians shed constantly and Labradors blow their entire coat twice a year.  Ive never owned a Golden so Im not sure about shedding for them. However they all tend to do well off leash and learn very easily.Like I said youre not going to get a medium or large dog that doesnt shed does well off leash and doesnt need a lot of exercise. Youre probably better off going back to small dogs.Edit Ill also recommend getting a boy as they tend to be more eager to please than females.,dogs,d74or3g,-1,t5_2qhhk

Ive owned smooth collies for many years approaching  and have done herding with them.  The majority of collies do have herding instinct but its modified by their gentle soft nature.  They are great with poultry and shy timid livestock such as lambs or Barbados sheep flighty high strung but not so good with heavy stubborn stock.    Every so often they do like to stop and give a good Lassie profile.  Collies are good at posing.   I think this is a pretty good write up on the pros and cons of collies.

8826624,0,t3_5100nj,For what its worth its unlikely the vet wouldve made your puppy vomit because bringing up hard solid items can damage the esophagus and the dog risks choking. They usually only do this for situations where the dog consumed something toxic and have a chance of expelling most of the toxic substance before digestion and absorption occurs. At least thats what my vet told me when my dog swallowed a chicken wing off the ground outside some jerk threw out. It ended up being digested fully as I never could find it in the poop and hes had XRays since then for unrelated reasons. If youre worried about it getting stuck you can increase the fiber in his diet for the next day or two maybe some canned pumpkin or cooked sweet potato. This will help cushion any undigested bone and move things along. The big danger with bones is that if splintered they will cause perforations but since he swallowed it whole its not as huge as a worry. Call your vet if he at all starts acting off but he will most likely be just fine.,dogs,d78u6e4,2,t5_2qhhk

You can also add attributes to an activity to record as well.

8910659,0,t3_527ok1,What breeds do you have?  SalukisWhy did you choose said breed? for example what were you looking for in a dog? Why did the choice end up on that particular breed rather than another breed with similar traits?  I originally saw them at a dog show and in my big dog book as a child and I have always thought about them since   years later when I got one. I probably chose them over other similar breeds because of looks and I thought I could still provide what they needed.Did you make the right choice? Whywhy not? for example did the breed turn out to be too active for you? Or too stubborn? Or did it live up to your expectations perfectly?  They were pretty much what I expected them to be probably because I talked to several breeders before acquiring one. Some breeders did make them out to be more difficult than they actually are probably in the interest of protecting the breed.Pros and cons of your breeds?  Pros is theyre pretty fabulous weekend warriors. Theyre fairly healthy with an average lifespan of  all breeds have their problems of course and hemangiosarcoma is their big problem. They tend to be not dog aggressive. Theyre good house dogs when theyre grown. Cons are they can be flighty shy dogs. They arent great at being off least not super receptive to obedience. Some of them definitely cant live with cats. What type of person do you think fits your breed the best? for example an easygoing person with little need for obedience or a highly active person who practically lives outdoors? Or anything in between  I think an owner should be pretty easygoing. These dogs are liable to blow you off regardless of the incentive you have. They do need someone who is willing to exercise them daily and to find a spot to let them run free but they dont need structured intense exercise for hours each day. They have to be able to laugh off the amount of petty theft these dogs commit. Do you have any plans for your next potential breed? Will you stick to your current breed or do you have a new breed in mind? Whywhy not. My next dog will be another dog of the same breed. We may eventually get a whippet for the household SO wants one. A token Afghan Hound may be in my distant future. Azawakhs also interest me but I dont know how well Id like owning one. ampnbsp,dogs,d7ixj7d,2,t5_2qhhk

The following are actual things that happened but not exactly what was said.Ugh its sooo mean to make your dog work like that.  Just let her be a dog!.  Have I got news for you Luce would go INSANE without her job.  She bugs me to take her out and go somewhere.  It would be mean NOT to let her work.Its obvious you dont feed her enough.  Shes so skinny!  Thats animal abuse!.  Go cry about it.  Shes a healthy weight and leaves food in her dish if I give her too much.   You should let memy kids pet your dog.  Its not fair to deprive him of love.  No.  I am not letting you or your nastyass spawn anywhere near my dog.  She has a job to do and she doesnt want your petting anyway.  She couldnt care less about your feelings. Also Ive been referring to Luce as a girl for  minutes and youre still calling her a he?Its not safe to let your dog ride in the front seat.  You could get in a crash.  No its not ideal but if shes not close enough to alert me of a medical crisis I will crash.  She wears a crashtested harness which I know you saw because you followed me out to my car and watched me put it on her.  Creep.I bet you keep that dog drugged.  No dog acts that calm.  Its not natural. Honestly what?  Why would that even cross your mind?

8917147,0,t1_d7jo8db,Awww! Our Lolas definitely have a lot of similarities! Any idea on her breeds? Lola is Rottweiler Boxer GSD Brittany and Dalmation  I hope so much that you guys find a good trainer to help you through this stuff. It can be SO hard to know if a trainer is qualified and we really wanted to believe our first one was but by contrast to the new trainer its pretty clear the degree of difference between them. Our trainer did say that true BAT setups are pretty hard to orchestrate for the average dog owner and as such she prefers to do more stealth BAT where she lurks near dog parks or trails  The bonus is that yesterday several dog owners at the dog park could tell we were working on reactivity and kindly offered to let us use them and their dogs for a few minutes when they were exiting the dog park. It was such a nice gesture. I wish you guys the best and am rooting for your Lola too! ,dogs,d7jpl8e,2,t5_2qhhk

8921379,0,t1_d7jzizy,Yes and no. Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs do have recent wolf ancestry but they are a recognized dog breed and from what I understand they mostly stopped crossing wolves into the breed a while ago s I want to say. These days Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs are closer to dogs than wolves but they are still very high energy high drive difficult to manage dogs.  Theyre not a good fit for someone who is looking for just a pet.  They need to be with an experienced owner who is willing to do some serious training preferably involving dog sport andor working venues.So the bottom line is if you absolutely have to have a dog that looks like a wolf you would probably be better off with a Czechoslovakian Wolfdog than you would be with an actual wolf hybrid but that doesnt necessarily mean that a Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is a great fit for you either.Edit Not a stupid question by the way.,dogs,d7k7wc3,13,t5_2qhhk

8959586,0,t1_d7osmu2,So you are saying it can only be high prey drive if it cant be called off prey?  Lol quite funny!  I assure you that by the average persons definition of prey drive my dogs are very high up there.  Especially my Mali they have one of the highest prey drives out of any breed.  Yet if you watch any IPO competition you will see the handlers have complete control.  No Huskies and sight hounds have high prey drive but more I importantly they are difficult to train and are stubborn.  I suggest revising your definition of prey drive.  Interact well with stock of course lol.  Every farm animal should.  If they freakin attacked the stock they would probably be sold.  But at the same time so would a dog lacking drive that wont head or heel etc.  Perhaps though you can talk about your favourite breed with working Aussie breeders that breed dogs for herding work.  Not just HITs them.  ,dogs,d7ot3hq,-2,t5_2qhhk

8966055,0,t1_d7pjbx2,But you still havent answered my question that if a dog is missing part of the sequence does that mean in your eyes it stops being prey drive?  and I forgot to answer before yes.  I have been with sighthounds on a leash and they do have a passive search and are always looking and searching independantly.  And while neither my dogs are similar when not working and my mali is nothing much of a searcher at all gundogs are bred for a very strong search when working and both my working lab and even more so working cockers when trying to find something they were far more intense.   But my lab only searches with intensity when he actually had something to find and is in working mode and working cockers?  Well I know agility trainers which allow time to sniff as a reward for the dog and working cockers have a lot of scent drive.  And you used a sighthound as an example but surely you mean scenthounds too which includes a search based on scent.  ,dogs,d7pl27a,1,t5_2qhhk

9012594,0,t3_53ogu4,My dog has had two of these episodes exactly as you describe.The first time it happened in  and resulted in  evet visits and an internist consult.  Each time he would go through  minutes of air gulping apparently struggling to breathe and trying to lick anything and everything that was in sight  the floor the rug the door frame.  It looked a lot like this  He puked in the car on the way to the evet and by the time we saw the vet he was acting completely normal.  They did xrays and physical exam and couldnt find anything wrong although the evet mentioned there was a lot of gas in his esophagus.  They sent him home with some antiemetic drugs to settle his stomach.Same thing happened a few days later we went in to the evet again it always seems to happen in the middle of the night.  Took xrays same deal couldnt see anything so they referred us to an internist.Without doing an endoscopy  the internist thought was that it might be an upper GI infection possible helicobacter i.e. ulcers andor reflux that was irritating the esophagus.  Three days after we started on an antibiotic and an acid reducer Snowball puked up a bezoar  a congealed ball of indigestible material.  In his case it was mostly hair.  I emailed a photo of it to the internist she was  certain that had been his issue and told us to cancel our followup visit about the reflux.The second time it happened was a couple of months ago this time the gulping lasted only for one night and he puked up his dinner and a small piece of thread.  Having gone through all that before Im fairly certain that something had shifted the thread which may not have been fully swallowed started bothering his esophagus and then when he puked it up he was totally fine.  He hasnt had any more similar licking episodes since then.As an aside I am pretty certain that my boy also occasional has complex partial seizures especially if he is woken from sleep directly into a higharousal state like if I come home from work early he compulsively humps the air sometimes with compulsive tongue extensions not licking just sticking his tongue all the way out stiffly.

My dog actually would be a perfect fit for your needs  he can keep up with however much exercise you want but he spends the rest of his time laying around Hes just a super mixed no clear breed mutt. Id emphasize the older dog part. I adopted my dog when he was a year old and he needed a LOT more exercise than he does now. He used to pace around and wake me up at the crack of dawn to go for a walk. Now hell sleep until Im ready to get up and he can take a day offminimal exercise without being annoying. Try to look for dogs who have been in foster for a couple weeks at least if thats possible. It takes a while for the dogs true personality and needs to come out. Ask a lot of questions. A good rescue shouldnt do it but some of them use coded language to describe negative traits. Like prefers to be your only friend! could mean doesnt like sharing attention at home but is fine with other dogs or could mean HATES other dogs cannot be near them. The breeds people have recommended are great starting points but the advantage of rescue is that its easier to evaluate an individual dogs adult traits rather than generally dogs of this breed will be this. ,dogs,d7z6rj4,2,t5_2qhhk

I want to be able to help her if that happens. And thank you! I figured we would bond eventually but I also just worry a lot haha.

I prefer to let my pup meet new dogs off leash and thats a recipe for disaster in a park with  unknown offleash dogs in the nearby vicinity. We have a local dog walkers group with doggie friends for him to play with but since every walk involves training starting with a play session isnt possible.

To take an example my puppy cost  to adopt they have some formula which is base fee  weight  less or more of a charge for adult vs puppy and I think the fee at that shelter for getting back a dog you lost is  which seems pretty fair given that they give all stray dogs a vet check shots and fleatick and dewormer in addition to feeding them of course.,dogs,d82sdg5,1,t5_2qhhk

Im able to see people coming when were in there and theres less dog traffic making it easier to gradually introduce her to dogs I think she might be friendly with have play dates with known friends and avoid those she hates. Yesterday I was playing fetch with her in this dog park and saw a lady approaching with her two dogs. Wed already established pretty clearly from a previous visit through the fence that Syd likes the male dog but is aggressive toward the female one. So I asked her to please wait a minute to let me leash my dog and leave. Oh its okay she says theyre both really friendly. I mean Ive heard this before but at this point Syd is making her feeling very clear as I hold her by the collar and I have no idea how you could mistake her behavior for anything other than aggression. Its not them its my dog. She really doesnt like your female sorry. Let me just get her out first. It is at this point the lady opens the gate to come it. The fuck? Both her dogs are on flexis and as Im trying my best to speed up leashing Syd and leaving the female dog is trying to approach us as her owner just holds the end of the flexi without doing anything. So then Im trying my best to leash Syd while dancing around this female dog and make it clear to the owner that my dog will hurt your dog. So I drag a leashed and angry Syd as fast as I can over to the gate as this lady starts to unleash her dog before Im even out of the park. Why lady? We made it out of the dog park and the owner starts saying how she hates that I have to leave and Syd looks like such a nice dog and am I sure I have to. I just... Im not even angry at this point Im completely baffled by her.One minute of waiting to let us leave is all I asked for...,dogs,d847qyn,14,t5_2qhhk

9093419,0,t3_54tn9x,I struggled with choosing when to make contact too. I wanted to wait until after we moved into our current apartment so it would look like our life was more together but ended up contacting breeders before than anyway. We put a deposit down on our apartment in March started contacting breeders in early April got officially approved by our breeder the same day we moved into our apartment in midMay. Then the puppies were born at the end of June and Summit came home at the end of August. We got really lucky with how fast the process went Ive heard of people waiting years for their puppy but  Im glad we didnt wait. It gave us time to build the relationship with our breeder and the breeder before her who ended up having a false pregnancy and referred us to our breeder and once we were approved the wait felt like forever especially once the puppies were born. Id say wait until all of your finances and housing are in order detailed plans etc. but start contacting breeders as soon as you have everything else figured out. ,dogs,d84vss1,1,t5_2qhhk

I love my dog and wouldnt mind either.She simply does not want to get into the car since her last two trips were both to the vet and are still very fresh in her mind. The first one was obviously for the spay. The second one was because of her reaction to the anesthesia from the spay. She wouldnt eat or drink and kept vomiting so I took her back to the vet. They gave her fluids intravenously as well as an antinausea shot and a B injection to raise her appetite.I didnt want to stress her out by forcing her into the car unless necessary. But considering Im probably making matters worse by continuously rolling her onto her back and checking and rechecking her incision Ive decided to take her to the vet anyways. It will put both our minds to ease.Edit Typos.Edit Heres proof since Reddit can be quite skeptical I dont mind whatever cost or whatever trip.

I will say that I have known really good breeders who werent very good at raising confident dogs. The ones like this tend to prioritise the sport over the dog and this leads to nervous unsure adult dogs who havent received enough socialisation or have developed learned helplessness. This also happens a lot when a breeder doesnt take their dogs out separately very common in conformation so the dog is fine when its around its littermates and canine family even at busy show environments but goes to pieces once it has to live its life on its own.Was she confident in your house at first?

Demodex is not contagious and all dogs have it from birth but sometimes it causes outbreaks in certain dogs. Get it looked at by a vet as soon as possible because it can lead to secondary infections which can cause more problems.

9130541,0,t3_55c8ii,Just a girl who grew up on a ranch and has dealt with her fair share of unexpected puppy litters and stray dogs so take what I say with a grain of salt. Nature will take its course and the mother will wean her puppies which will start around  weeks and itll finish around  weeks. Itll be stressful for both her and the litter. Her milk supply is going to dwindle and dry up so you need to start supplementing the pups with kibble. From my experience we separated the pups for a few hours daily and introduced them to a reliable puppy kibble wetting it milk replacer is best but warm water will do to begin with and then gradually decreasing it till they would eat solids. You want to be careful and make sure the mothers milk supply dries up otherwise itll be painful for her engorged mammary glands can lead to an infection. Pups tend to separate from their mother between  weeks. Youll need to get them checked for worms especially since they are strays as intestinal worms can be transmitted via uterine or through her milk. That needs to be done between  weeks of age. First vaccinations are typically done between  weeks. Your best bet is to bring them to a veterinarian as theyll be able to give you a timeline of age and check for any harm. Hope this helped if theres anything else that I might be able to answer Ill be happy to help. Best of luck!,dogs,d89d15i,3,t5_2qhhk

9198569,0,t1_d8hw6fu,I work at a shelter and we receive transports from down south. We have strict protocols regarding vaccine history and any animal transported across states line has to have a health certificate. Also anything over  months has to be temperament evaluated beforehand. That said nothing is perfect and a seemingly healthy animal can break with something after transport. I worry about other shelters that might not be so diligent in their protocols and there is a real risk of spreading disease across different areas.,dogs,d8hzioc,4,t5_2qhhk

Apparently it is very sweet.As for dogs grapes raisins onions chocolate and coffee too beer gum citrus foods make them a little sick but the leaves and stems can make them very sick macadamia nuts and anything with xylitol as mentioned.Generally I wouldnt let your dog eat anything people food unless you KNOW its safe.

9204198,0,t1_d8ikh2q,And onions apple seeds garlic and nuts. There are even more than what I just listed. I think there are about a dozen foods which are very bad for dogs. Things with sulfides or sulfates found in garlic and onions are bad for your dog. I agree with the other comments your family has clearly demonstrated a lack of respect for you and your dog. You should not allow your family to be around your dog. Also the darker the chocolate the more dangerous it is for the dog. Dark chocolate has higher levels of coco and it is more dangerous than milk chocolate. Do not misunderstand that ALL chocolate is dangerous for dogs but some types more than others.The lethality of chocolate depends on two factors the coco content and the body weight of a dog. Small dogs are more likely to become sick or perish than larger dogs due to their lower weight.It might be worth considering pet insurance too any nonroutine trip to the vet is bound to be expensive.One last thing you should consider talking to your vet about what emergency first aid steps you should know in the event that your dog is poisoned. ,dogs,d8ip8ms,3,t5_2qhhk

I want to encourage her to go out and explore.I basically ignore her. She wanders out. I throw a surprise ball over her head.You could also teach a spot to go to away from you. When he makes it out to the spot come to him and reward.I say all this because I believe dogs are much better at tiring themselves out than any of our efforts. Building independence in general will be the first step to herding sports.For instance right now I am starting scent work. I just hide a treat and ask her to go find it. She needs to learn that following her nose results in reward.So yea ranging and scent work are a good beginner job for a dog.,dogs,d8nsjn2,3,t5_2qhhk

However since the walks are so short now we dont really encounter any other animals. He doesnt even seem particularly interested in sniffing much either.Ive tried to jog slightly to see if that makes him start walking but he usually just plants.

I resigned myself that maybe it was the heat but it started cooling down and she got worse so back to the vet I went.Apoquel seems to be helping but its not the best longterm solution and is expensive to boot.

People dont really train them properly but in that same vein Chihuahuas are actually hard to train. Formerly owned by a Chihuahua. He was with us for  years and I loved him dearly. They are stubborn aggressive clingy and a bit neurotic. Also people get creeped out by the constant shivering. Even after years of behavior training my Chihuahua had Napoleon Syndrome and would challenge the larger dogs to duels. However all of those negative qualities can be their best too.

Many fearfulaggressive dogs actually run towards the thing theyre scared of because they feel like they need to eliminate the threat. Generally speaking dogs should not meet each other while on leash. They feel they dont have an escape route which can make them feel insecure and make them react more be aggressive than they would offleash. The other issue is that if two dogs meet each other and one of them was too roughforwardannoying while greeting the other the dogs might snap and correct the other which can start a fight or serious injure the other dog. Thats why its not good to let dogs with unknown temperaments like the dogs at the shelter meet each other.,dogs,d95zfpl,5,t5_2qhhk

If your dog is being particularly testy have  controlled and limited interactions for  weeks.That means let them know each other is there but dont keep them in the same spaces together and do NOT leave them unattended together.Give them their own spaces their own room their own toys and let the new dog get adjusted to the house as your older dog get adjusted to the new dog being there. Be patient give it time and do NOT rush this. They both need to get comfortable with their new living arrangements especially if one or the other havent cohabited with another dog before. Then build up their interactions over time. Start with quick passing interactions short and sweet. Let them say hi and then get them on their way. Unless they suffer from barrier frustration you can let them still see each other but not have face to face interactions. Once again building up over time.Are both dogs fixed?Theres also the fact that the dogs might be Dog SelectiveDog Aggressive being a Staffy thats a possibility and theres the simple fact that she doesnt play well with other dogs considering this this might not be the right home for the younger pup. Also consider the following some dogs dont like having other people or dogs in their face and will snapbite. Its not so much aggressive as it is defensive but it can still do damage.

I started early  like  AM which was when he would cry to go out. I slowly pushed it back. It took my about a week until he could make it to  am then I did  minute increments until  AM. I stuck with that time for a few months and have recently trained him to sleep until   He had been a stray before we adopted him. Id imagine you might have to go more slowly than me though with a young puppy. It was horrible for a few weeks very depressing to set an alarm for  am but worked really well and very quickly.  If he usually wakes you up at  am set your alarm the first night for  or  so he learns that you will let him out.

He wasnt bad or problematic he just never really seemed to want to meet me half way and was of a temperament that I dont tend to bond well with. He was mainly my husbands dog.I currently have a  yo GSD who I desperately wanted to my perfect dog but his disposition is just so intense and pushy and high strung. He seems more like an ongoing management project than a true best friend. He is very demanding and responds to attention with great excitement and hyperactivity so it is difficult to just enjoy him. Love him and he is a very good boy but I just do not enjoy spending time with him. he is never content always demanding more attention or play or treats gets jealous of my other dogs who are much calmer and easier for me to interact with. Honestly I would rehome him if a perfect home was available because I do not feel I am able to give him all the attention and activity he needs. My husband is going through serious medical issues and I have to crate this dog so much because he is not able to interact appropriately. My husband is very unstable on his feet needs a walker at times plus has very thin skin and is prone to infection so this dog constantly slamming himself into us and swiping us with his paws is not simply annoying it is dangerous to my husband. My other three and my previous GSD have been able to be calm indoors and interact gently. They are just much more suitable to the life I am able to provide and do not demand constant interaction.

9536125,0,t3_5bfp05,Because Luckys my only and first dog and a mutt I just really dont know how it has affected herI dont have much to compare it with. But shes an amazing and easy and brilliant dog. My vet calls her magical. I adopted her at about  weeks from a rescue in the south that trucks dogs that would land in high kill shelters up north where there are more homes. Lucky along with her mom and siblings was found by the owner of a farm when his tenants abandoned the property.  Apparently animal control was called because there were multiple dogs but Luckys mom hid with her litter under a trailer. Somehow eventually they ended up in rescue. I applied for her on the internet Petfinder and picked her up at an adoption event at my local pet store at about  or  weeks of age. Shes now a bit over a year. Shes been the easiest dog imaginable. Having a puppy is hard of course but my Lucky was housebroken within two weeks even though I dont think shed ever been in a house the rescue was a farm ... I think she was in a barn or kennel or something she has never destroyed anything well anything that wasnt hers anyway shes sweet and just really whipsmart. Weve put a great deal of work into it though  as far as training goes we started with puppy kindergarten then took many other classes puppy obedience intermediate obedience tricks class puppy agility and agility . We are taking Canine Good Citizen prep class next month and then repeating tricks class. Shes earned her Novice Trick Dog title and is working on her Intermediate Trick Dog. So shes a very trained dog. And obviously that influences her behavior. But she picked it all up so easily. As far as early influence goes I will say this  she is very good with other dogs and she plays with beautiful manners. I attribute this at least in part to the fact that she was with her siblings until she was  weeks old. I think that extra couple of weeks playing and tumbling about with them helped her with that a great deal. In that respect she was better off than a purebred from a fancy breeder  many breeders send the dogs home at  weeks. Which is totally fine Im not saying there is anything wrong with that but like I said I think the extra couple of weeks with the sibs helped my dog to really learn how to be social with dogs. ,dogs,d9oiylj,2,t5_2qhhk

Multiple litters before  is like multiple kids before you are . There is also only one kind of chihuahua the terms apple and deer head are used by crap breeders and I think deer head is the one that specifically describes an incorrect head  though people selling apple heads dont necessarily have correct dogs just less glaringly incorrect onesThat said chihuahuas are great dogs and she sounds like she has being living in a home environment so shouldnt adjust too poorly.

Keep trying to make contact with them. I would advise you not to commit to buying a puppy from a breeder without talking on the phone with them and visiting their facilities if possible. There are a ton of great posts on this sub explaining what a responsible breeder looks like. I would search this sub and read through as many posts as possible. Good luck! ,dogs,d9qr27g,4,t5_2qhhk

9584019,0,t3_5c7z1o,I had the most frustrating night with my puppy last night. Hes been the most difficult dog Ive ever tried to house break and I dont know if its because I dont have a yard this time I live on the second floor or that because of the layout of the house I cant give him access to the front door there is a pantry closet with food and trash cans right next to the front door but the sliding doors are broken because the idiot before me decided to install solid core doors on a track meant for a much lighter door... it should be fixed in a few weeks which will help. This puppy also has had zero issue with peeing in his crate. Apparently the whole waste in the den thing just doesnt phase him I will be sitting in the room and he will just stand up and squat in his crate without so much as a whimper. Im actually staring to think that he thinks its an easy way to get out of the crate since I take him out after this obviously. Thankfully hell howl for number .So last night after a few weeks of getting better I decided to start giving him more free access to his water. Normally I give him water with his meals and after walks. Im very careful to make sure he gets enough water a day by at controlled timesamounts to help with housebreaking. He decided to thank me by peeing. Everywhere. On the floor. On the couch. Also found out he could jump on the couch now On his bed. On my bed. In both of his crates when I put him in to clean up his mess. And I keep him close by and dont let him wander apparently he has a drinking and consequently a peeing problem. It was just a very bad night.I know it will get better because it has but it is very frustrating on days like this.

You can definitely find them in the  lb range though Id think. Try getting in touch withGreat Fluffy Dog RescueNew England Great Dane RescueThe first has a lot of Great Pyrs and dont seem to have anything at the moment that would suit you but theyd probably be a good org to work with. NEGDR is Dane specific but theyll probably know of other giant breed rescues that you can be in touch with. Often times too breed specific rescues will take mixes or even totally different breeds that have similar characteristics e.g. Giant so its worth being in touch. The problem with breeds like Bernese Bernards Leonbergers etc is that they are rarely up for adoption. They are quite easy going dogs and quite rare so the combination results in few of them being surrendered except in really extenuating circumstances. So you may need to hunt around and be patient.ETA Also check out St. Bernard Rescue Foundation...based in Maryland I think. They have quite a few cuties in at the moment.

They approach the boundary and either are shocked or hear the tone that they associate with shock. Thus you have created an association between something aversivescary and the presence of another dog passing by. It obviously doesnt happen with every dog but my trainer has treated multiple dogs who became reactive after being put in this situation.Its the same problem BTW that some dogs have when you walk them on a prong or choke collar. They can contain themselves enough to walk nicely until another dog comes along then they try to approach the other dog and get a yank on the correction collar causing pain that ultimately becomes associated with the presence of other dogs.,dogs,dabkk8o,12,t5_2qhhk

9738201,0,t1_dadffn5,I highly highly recommend taking a class in dog body language. A lot of training schools will run them for one afternoon on a weekend or something. A good one based in science will give you a lot of things to think about with the feedback your dog is giving you. There is also this one which will run for  weeks starting in April and I imagine is quite rich in content. In regards to resources that is up to you. I personally dont leave toys out because both of my dogs will resource guard from each other so its just a recipe for disaster. If you use toys for reward in training there may be benefit in not leaving them out so they stay high value. But its really up to you and your situation. ,dogs,dadg29d,3,t5_2qhhk

9781322,0,t1_daim8bh,The link you posted is to a video about the bullmastiff. Bullmastiffs are great too but unfortunately much of the working nature has been bred out of them. They are not as large as boerboels and have lower energy in general. Boerboels have a moderate amount of energy and are still very much working mastiffs. My boerboel is  months old and an absolute spitfire. She has high prey drive for a boerboel but lower than say a working mal or GSD but high enough I am having to channel her drive by working her to keep her out of trouble she is excellent at tracking and obedience. She is a great dog though after she grows up I want a male as well.You may also want to consider a cane corso. They would also meet much of the criteria you mentioned and are generally not as massive as boerboels slightly taller but weigh less. Edit The slobber isnt horrible they are sloppy drinkers and will get some drool going when training with treats but not generally super slobbery. Im sure YMMV with this one though.,dogs,dairgbs,2,t5_2qhhk

These requirements look incredibly fussy to me.I work in adoptions at a shelter and am sometimes told our standards are too high no I wont adopt a dog with separation anxiety into an apartment but this seems wild to me.

9785384,0,t1_dair16i,Ticking and blackbrown coloration are totally independent genes  mix a ticked dog with a black dog and youll likely get some puppies that are both black and ticked.

9805671,0,t3_5fdeum,If you focus on finding a reputable breeder that produces healthy dogs with solid temperaments Im confident you could find what you are looking for within the GSD breed. Yes there are tens of thousands of GSDs registered annually that unfortunately do not live up to the standard but there are still hundreds or even thousands of GSDs that embody the intelligence confidence and athleticism of the breed. Shiloh or King dogs arent meant to be GSDs  thats the whole point  and as far as I can tell the one constant among the individuals Ive known is that they essentially by design lack the standout qualities that are essential to a wellbred GSD. Im sure there are some very sweet individual dogs among those crosses but they are not GSDs and if you are looking for a healthy sweet dog generally and are not wedded to specific GSDbreed traits Im sure you can find what you are looking for among GSDs rescues or a shelter. ,dogs,dalrctb,1,t5_2qhhk
9807330,0,t1_dalcbub,Okay you cant talk about your pretty boy and not give me a picture!My previous dog was a euro line brindle boxer he had white only as a blaze on his head a little on his chest and little shoes of white on his paws and judges loved him in the ring. I can see a trend towards dogs that are on the border of being reverse brindle though so I hope they dont push the trend of dark dogs too far in the wrong direction since reverse brindle is a serious fault.Here I think the problem with accepting whites is that they have been culled for so many years and rarely pop up in the reputable breeder lines that the parent club just doesnt want to risk it with the BYB dogs since in the FCI for a dogs puppies to be able to get registered their parents have to have got a positive score in conformation so that automatically makes it harder for BYB to abuse white dogs for profit since their pups cant be registered. White does come with a higher chance of health risks but with strong regulations about accepting whites into the registration and shows I could see it work.,dogs,dalypai,1,t5_2qhhk

You might see an improvement soon my pupper took a week or two on the new food to stop itching chicken allergy. Changing meds right now might make it hard to tell what is helping and what isnt. If the limited ingredient diet turns out to be even a little effective great!

9882017,0,t3_5gurul,Pack walks are a thing that some trainers do probably based on having watched Ceasar Milan at some point. Im not going to say that they are a totally worthless construct but I think if you have a small dog you dont need to drag this dog out with a pack of dogs of all sizes. Ive said it before and Ill say it again dogs are not children. There is no big value to nonstop attempts at socializing them. All dogs should tolerate normal human interactions and be able to not fall apart if they have to be near other dogs. But not all dogs like other dogs and not all dogs want to interact with other dogs. Pack walks presume some sort of special magic takes place when you take a big group of dogs on a walk. What it actually is to be honest is an ego boost for the person running the walk...look at me I have a gazillion dogs off leash together. I see the pack walk thing over and over again in some dog training groups on Facebook that appear to be populated by people who dont have any real in depth experience training dogs but who want to be dog trainers. If you want to train your dog figure out what it is that you want as an end result then find that trainer who will help you achieve that. If you have no aspirations for your small dog to go on walks with a bunch of strange dogs of all sizes dont do pack walks. All that many dogs will learn is that they can not trust other dogs and they can not trust their human to keep them safe. ,dogs,davnf9l,5,t5_2qhhk

9988559,0,t1_db5ja3k,gt While individuals may decide to continue to work with their dog on aggressive behavior the moment an outsider is involved e.g. got bitten then the individual has to put their dog down. Am I correct in that assumption?No its not that black and white. As you said itll depend on the country and even possibly the region. Over here if someone gets bitten and goes to the hospitaldoctor they are obliged to give the details of the dogowner even if it is only mild. The dog is not automatically euthanised though far from it.Maybe people have a lower tolerance for aggressive dogs in countries other than the States. I was recently told about a Spanish Mastiff that bit one of his handlers as he was putting a collar on or something. The dog bit and would not let go  I got this second hand so I dont know how severe or unprovoked it all was. The dog was immediately put down though. In their minds they were not going to risk this reoccurring and it would not occur to them to work with their dog. ,dogs,db9jc5v,3,t5_2qhhk

If the owners dont come forward after  hours of the animal being taken into the shelter it legally becomes the shelters dog and then legally becomes the dog of whoever adopts it. The humane society said this kind of thing happens a lot but its a mixed bag on whether or not the dog was actually belonging to someone else or if someone just got jealous that the dog they wanted got adopted and tried to get it by saying it was theirs. They have backed up people like me in court before when original owners try to press charges but nothing ever comes out of it.gtIt doesnt take long for a dog to look skinny and uncared for while on the streets so its not really a good idea to judge his previous owners and their care based on that.Thats definitely true and thats why I mentioned that I could be way out of line by thinking that.,dogs,dbe7ck1,43,t5_2qhhk

10041030,0,t3_5ji0ar,I work at a dog kennel and we do dog baths. For heavy shedders like GSDs Huskies or Akitas these things are a godsend. Im pretty sure we have this brand but thats a rather pricy one. Nonetheless it works pretty well if you feel like dropping a huge wad of cash on it. I actually just used it on a German Shepherd today for about five minutes just to remove the biggest chunks of hair and it pretty much just comes flying out. In five minutes I had about probably as much hair as the pile in your picture but this dog had clearly not been brushed often either so that probably doesnt mean too much in this particular case. Its incredibly satisfying in any case to see it all fly off especially on dogs that have clearly not been up to date on getting brushed! But even dogs that were done often still benefited from itwe have a pair of Malamutes that get bathed fairly often and chunks of hair still come flying off of them. Most preparation tips are for the human involved. Set it up in a place you dont mind hair literally flying around wear clothes you dont mind getting incredibly hairy. A hairnet would be nice a face mask is pretty much required if you dont want to be breathing in dog fur andor loose and dead skin that is also removed. Goggles are nice too but I find they fog up and get annoying. Also I would recommend wearing earplugs especially if you are doing it in an enclosed areathe dryers can be loud.Desensitizing your dog to the dryer might be necessary. It can also be really helpful to either attach your dog to something stationary or have somebody hold his leash so that he doesnt dance around especially at first. Some dogs dont know what the hell youre doing but calm down once you get started and they figure it out a bit. I would recommend starting on the back legs and working up then over the back. Starting away from the face can help the dog get used to it too since the Big Scary Loud Thing is not near their face area at first.  ,dogs,dbgdeyj,5,t5_2qhhk

10065152,0,t1_dbjf4rt,Most likely individual incompetence andor the tension inherent to a lot of high tempo high risk calls. You get a call that someone is beating the shit out of a woman who is screaming for help. You go in with a weapon drawn. Its dark as hell and suddenly you hear something snarling and barking and see it coming your way. You put a round into that threat. Turns out it was behind a cage and lunged without any chance of getting to you. Legally speaking animals do not have the same protection as humans anywhere Ive ever heard of. In the US they are considered property and any threat they pose to the safety of a human life is automatically more important than the preservation of the animals life. Especially when cops generally dont just wander into your house  theyre there to help you or someone else who called who needed emergency services. If they have to kill a dog to make sure youre not being murdered they generally will. I had a call where a girl tried to commit suicide by overdosing. When I got there with fire rescue a great dane was laying on top of her growling at us. Any time I got close it snapped at me. Fire rescue looked at me expectantly. Given the luxury of a few moments to spare I checked around the apartment for dog food or treats. Found some but Fido was not interested. If I was getting to her it would be at the cost of my limbs.

Ive found some great responsible breeders who have been super informative and helpful even realising early on that their litter timing and mine didnt coincide they were delighted to talk with me about the breed suitability to my lifestyle and put me in contact with other breeders. Another breeder I contacted by email who lives a couple of hours drive away sent me a one liner with his phone number telling me to call him we had a short conversation and he told me to come and visit when I was in the area which I was planning to do. He drove out to look for us when we got somewhat lost ! and had us home for tea and biscuits with his wife talking for several hours seeing me interact with his dogs etc.These are hallmarks of good breeders people passionate about their dogs and happy to help and point people in the right direction. They will turn a person down if they dont feel they are the right fit. They are experienced in sussing people out by the questions they ask and the way they react.Finding a truly good breeder is priceless not only for the quality of pup  health temperament socialising and handling but for the lifelong helpline they provide. It is well worth making the effort spending the time and travelling the distance to find the right one.Let me know if you have any questions. How exciting!

Greyhound Hes content with one brisk  minute walk per day and a chance to runplay in the small fenced back yard big enough for him to chase a toy and frolic about for  seconds before he gets tired. Pyr Still low energy but needs two miles of brisk walking per day either all at once in the morning for  minutes or one mile in am and one in pm in addition to a few  minute fetchplay sessions in the back yard. Doberman Exercise is absolutely nonnegotiable. Each morning we either do a  minute minimum power walk with his weighted backpack on or we visit the local  acre fenced school yard thats a mile walk away or visit a golf coursepark up the road with trails before it opens and its all ours. He is remote collar trained so is off leash in parts of the park and at the school yard where he can run large rubberband loops around us as me and the other dogs walk or he gets to runplay chase with the pyr mix in the fenced school yard. He also gets a few  minute hard play sessions in our back yard and another  minutes of behavior training before meals and then spends most of his waking time in the house on a bed chewing a toy. Hes a busy guy but very typical of his breed!For most dogs though Id say two ish minute walks twice a day is a good starting point. I also second u s suggestion for a backpack as this helps my dobie focus and burn a lot more energy faster and feel like hes working. Its an easy addition to your daily routine but challenges them mentally and physically if you add up to  of their body weight gradually. ,dogs,dbqfp0u,3,t5_2qhhk

10136682,0,t3_5l467t,My Lucy a Smooth Collie was diagnosed with IDB when she was .  She did best with fish and sweet potato foods various brands and also proplan sensitive stomach food.  It really helped to make our own training treats and avoid all commercial treats I think she was sensitive to some types of preservatives.She gradually became less sensitive and more able to tolerate different foods and as well her poops became firmer.  By  ish she had a cast iron stomach and very firm poops. She lived to age . As I  understand it sometimes early sensitivities are due to autoimmune problems and sometimes like with Lucy a dog can outgrow the problem. BTW when Lucy was  we learned she enjoyed picking glass Christmas ornaments off the tree and eating them. We think she ate about  of them before we figured it out unusually glittery poop. One with would think glass shards would be detrimental to a dogs health but Lucys IBD was actually much improved that month.  I dont recommend glass shards as an IBD treatment  Lucy was a weirdo.,dogs,dbstb5j,4,t5_2qhhk

10138506,0,t3_5l222m,I think this is such a silly and insignificant thing for the our neighbors to the north to focus on when there are a multitude of more pressing matters requiring their attention some of which OP has mentioned puppy mills ahem legitimate animal abuse.Cropping and docking in my area is viewed with some trepidation CA. I havent outright asked people what they think of Apollos cropped ears docked tail and lack of dewclaws but Im certain if I were to bring it up in conversation I would be met with some curiosity and most definitely some vitoral most people are unaware Dobermans dont naturally come with upright ears and short adorable nubs. Those that are normally upset by it usually cite how they imagine the dog would feel and are swayed by graphic images are uninformed about howwhy the procedures are done and are not aware of the significance of that breeds lack of tailear leather in being able to perform its job properly without risk of injury.Many breeds are cropped docked or both Boxers Poodles Schnauzers Rots Cocker Spaniels Yorkshire Terriers Boston Terriers Vislas Weimaraners over  different recognized AKC breeds will have dockingcropping or a combo performed. Tail docking and dewclaw removal happen so early literally the puppies nervous system is not even developed enough to perceive pain Dobermans will normally have their tails docked within  days of birth. Anesthesia is not used as this could easily endanger the life of the puppy so early on. Cropping in my preferred breed is done before  weeks at the latest. This is done under general anesthesia by a veterinarian you are provided aftercare instructionsantibiotics pain relief medication your breeder will teach you posting or in my case because of the distance a woman who had shown and posted Dobermans for  years assisted my husband and I in proper posting procedures which are not painful for the puppies. Most ethical Doberman breeders would not allow you to take home an uncropped puppy in the US. You would more than likely have to contact the breeder far in advance to try and procure an uncropped pup and even then good luck. You primarily see uncroppedundocked puppies sold by BYBs. Some EU countries   have banned croppingdocking and see it as a barbaric practice but not all. Serbia looks at dockingcropping very differently than say Germany who wont even allow an imported Doberman with a crop to be shown. Again cultural differences A good amount of Europeans wont spayneuter their dogs either and we see that as unethical. Different country different culture before I get hate Germany is where I was born.So again we default to what our culture deems acceptable some EU countries prefer tubal litigation or vasectomies but I digress. When Ive spayed or neutered dogs they have been out of commission much longer than say with a crop. Apollo literally was up playing the next day after his anesthesia had worn off. It is literally a flesh wound and if you dont want to have your dog croppeddocked be my guest but I will continue to have croppeddocked Dobermans in my life. I will add my own anecdotal evidence as well not one ear infection compared to other pendulous eared dogs Ive had the fortune to ownmeet. Cant say I know other Doberman owners in the community that have had a crop and had the dog suffer ear infection after ear infection.Anyway I also want to point out the cropdock serves the purpose of leaving no handholds for an attacker of the Doberman again serving his main purpose to be an unstoppable guardian. ,dogs,dbt1vew,9,t5_2qhhk

10143339,0,t1_dbtnxua,How your grandma did or didnt raise him is irrelevant because hes in the care of someone who is able to spend time with him and train him. Does he have any food puzzle toys? Is he still able to chew on things like bully sticks?If they are at the end of their rope and unwilling to spend more time with him he is honestly better off in a breedspecific rescue than having his pleas for attention silenced via ecollar.I like to put myself in my puppys shoes sometimes. He wakes up in the morning and has to pee really badly. He is patient and waits for me to let him out of his crate. He probably wants to get up and stretch out and start running like he does every morning when I let him out...ButMy TMJ is acting up and my jaw is in excruciating pain. All I want to do is take a hot shower and a couple Advils. I dont do this though because I can imagine myself in his shoes needing to go to the bathroom but not being allowed to. Having a tank full of energy just ready to burst and needing to get out so badly only to have to endure this for longer despite knowing that there are people up and awake who could let me do this despite choosing not to.. so I get up I take him out despite the pain I get together some treat toys and put them in the laundry room with him and then I take a shower with some Advil. When Im out and feeling better he and I are able to enjoy the day as usual.It just isnt right to put a dog aside because you dont feel like doing something with it. I dont want to go for a walk when Im in excruciating pain but my puppy does.. there needs to be compromise and I need to hold up my promise to take him for that walk as soon as Im better and in the meantime he still needs to be entertained.Its a lot easier to put aside the needs of a smaller dog but it almost always ends up in behaviours like manic barking. If I ignored my puppy he would literally destroy my house.,dogs,dbtoj6s,10,t5_2qhhk

LolWhat youve described sounds similar to my setup though. When we are home and indoors its time to chill. There arent a bunch of toys laying around and its generally not acceptable to demand a lot of attention.Thats kind of a necessity considering I live with a couple of roomates who are not especially fond of animals. I personally wouldnt mind my dogs running around wrestling with each other or throwing rubber chicken toys at lamps true story but I understand that not everybody is in to that and that my mother wouldnt be nearly as thrilled about me bringing her grandpups to visit if such were the norm.

10161249,0,t3_5lf90d,Lately Duke hasnt been walking further than the corner of our street again. When I tried taking him out last Thursday he got spooked by someone sweeping leaves and wouldnt even leave the driveway. Today I put the Thunder Shirt on him and he walked past the corner and made it about a quarter of a mile before he got freaked out by a garage door opening. We turned around as soon as I noticed he was hesitating and he stayed under threshold for the walk back. I dont know if I should continue to use the thunder shirt as a training tool since he seemed to do better with it on. I cant really find any information on its use as a training tool. Really I wonder if it may be time to talk to our vet about medication.

10161723,0,t3_5lgr33,What kind of food are you giving him? He could well have an allergy to it. If you havent already consider changing him to a different food  higher quality if hes on a low quality brand now IAMs Blue Buffalo Eukanuba Purina Hills and Taste of the Wild to name a few  or a different protein if hes already on a high quality food. Many people have luck with less common proteins like Kangaroo Venison Bison and others.Adding a small bit of coconut oil to his food can help soothe the dandruff and moisturize his skin from the inside.

10193709,0,t3_5lz22h,I think the feeling really starts to fade as your pup starts becoming slightly more independent and confident with being alone. I think the feeling completely vanished at  weeks of having the pup. With each day after the peak at around  weeks the feeling fades a little and starts seriously fading at the  week mark. I guess part of that is because at  weeks youve had the pup for a month. Thats enough time to form habits. So you no longer think about things and worry  stress about doing it. You just do it. Its now routine. The new norm has settled in and you gain a measure of confidence from that. No longer is everything new and uncertain.

10208967,0,t1_dc110s1,I disagree with you so much. Youre a saint for adopting aggressive dogs but youre also a rarity. I agree that bites that dont break the skin are not actually aggression aggression but they are still aggressive and holy cow there are so so so so so many dogs that could have that spot at the shelter or in the foster that will not hurt people.First a dog with a bite history is probably not going to ever find a home. If you drop it off at a no kill shelter and they actually take it it will live out its life under exercised and stressed in kennel with barking dogs and strangers constantly walking by where its biting problem is just going to get worse and worse. Would you adopt the stressed out pit mix that is a known biter or the pit mix next to it that is acting like a friendly puppy?Second nokill shelters do kill pets. Frequently actually. If they are sick or aggressive they usually get put down. No kill doesnt mean never kill. It means they control their intake so that they dont get flooded with pets like a traditional animal shelter does. This means they dont have to kill to make room. They still kill for other reasons though. They would probably kill this dog.Thirdly if they did adopt out a dog with a known bite history and the dog bit someone they very likely could be liable. This one goes for foster based rescues as well.Fourthly if you were were a foster for a rescue and you were willing to take a dog with a bite history and you manage to rehab it successfully youre probably get all the biters that come through. That sucks and youre probably not going to want to foster anymore.There are many other reasons those are just the ones off the top of my head.Im sorry Im not targeting you personally but I see this type of answer come up a lot and it just makes my skin crawl. Taking a dangerous dog and sloughing it off on someone else is so shitty. Giving up on a poorly trained dog makes you a bad pet parent but dropping a biter that could hurt someone off on a rescue or shelter makes you a bad person. I know its unpleasant to think about but if OP cant handle their own biting dog they should not expect someone else to handle it and they should not put someone else in the dangerous situation of having to. They should deal with it like a responsible adult. They either train the dog to be fully trust worthy develop a system where the dog NEVER gets to interact with anyone else and is always secure in the yard or muzzled in public or just buck up and put the dog down. ,dogs,dc18rpf,3,t5_2qhhk

10212292,0,t1_dc1jk6m,Heres how I did itI put him in the crate and walked away. If he didnt cry I turned around and came back to say hi. I maybe walked away for  seconds. If he cried I walked further away.  I would never turn towards him or give him attention if he was crying in the crate. Quiet dog  good dog  attention for dog. I kept making the time I was away longer.Part of it was just leaving him alone to cry. Sometimes for half an hour. He would eventually tire of crying and be quiet then I could come back as a reward! I see it as training three things . Puppy needs to learn how to be alone. Puppy needs to learn that crying does not get things. Patience and quiet get things. . Puppy needs to learn to trust that you will come back.Hope that helps!,dogs,dc1md64,4,t5_2qhhk

You said its intent is NOT so much on behalf of the animals themselves. How can it become a tangential point? Explain.  You simply told me how the data was collected which speaks nothing as to the intent for collecting that data. But I meant my point there was tangential because as far as our discussion goes its not a super important point what the underlying intent was. gt Show me where in the US it is TOLERATED to torture a dog in PUBLIC and bystander will not do anything.You will never find two examples that are exactly alike. Nor have I said whats happening in Romania is exactly the same as whats happening in the U.S. You can point out many differences but if you let any one difference prevent any comparison from being made youre going to miss the larger point here. And youre going to miss what I was disagreeing with in the first place.Animal cruelty is tolerated on large scales in many many places including Romania and the United States even if they are not tolerated in the exact same way or to the exact same animals.gt TENS OF THOUSANDS of dogs every yearYes and that is horrible and unethical.

10255626,0,t3_5musq4,My dog has bitten me to the point where she drew blood once because her anal gland had ruptured and I was examining her trying to work out wtf was going on. She turned her head so her tooth managed to get between the side of my thumbnail and the skin the only real way she could do any kind of damage given her size. Considering she was probably in quite a bit of pain it was more defensive than anything else.My only other bite experience was a friend of a friends maltese who bit me after I touched his paw.

10268950,0,t3_5mzvq5,Make sure she has a place for herself.  I would recommend a crate if she likes hers but a bed or blanket at the very least.  This will help her settle more.  If she is crate trained this can also be a solution of where to put her if you need to leave the office.My other suggestion is do a reconnaissance of your building.  Figure out where she can go to the bathroom what flooring there is and if shes encountered it before and if there is an elevator where the stairs are in case of a potty emergency.  Also think about have a sign or something to let people know you have a dog in the office.  Most of the time it will be used by coworkers who want dog time but it also will allow your dog averse collegues to send you an email instead.edit the flooring recommendation comes after I offered to take my coworkers border collie who was apparently terrified of  of the floors in the building.

10281336,0,t3_5n6z8x,I got a German shepherd when I was  after my previous one passed away. Honestly German shepherds are one of the best dogs you could have around your kids. They are protective and loving and highly intelligent. Youd have to teach your family how to react around the puppy otherwise the puppy will be getting mixed signals from you. No dog intentional wants to hurt anyone unless of course something else is going on and its for safety etc. My German shepherd was playful as a puppy but he would know when to calm down and be gentle. Even when running around me and playing he never hurt me. The one time he accidentally bit too hard while we were playing and it drew a speck of blood he freaked out. He kept whining and had his head down the whole day long. That was when he was around  months old. Ever since then he has been even more gentle around me and only plays roughly with other people. Encourage your family to give the puppy time to grow and learn and hopefully they will see what you see in the pup. And yes like what others have mentioned bring the pup to obedience class and get your family to come along. There is joy in teaching your dog something and maybe when they do it themselves they will be more attached. ,dogs,dc9g21w,1,t5_2qhhk

10294168,0,t1_dcat2gd,No problem! We took her to a puppy class and a basic obedience class which was great for initial socializing as well as getting her used to training. We did training sessions every day on basic obedience which was really important to us  knowing that people may be afraid of her particularly on her focusing on usone of us in distracting situations we continue these training sessions now too. Ive never had any real problems at the dog park  only some of what other people in this thread are saying about some people mostly new dog owners dont realize that her vocal playing is really only playful and not aggressive she barks and talks while she plays.In terms of exercise I find that running is way better for her than walking to actually tire her out  so the dog park is great. When were walking its more like a combined exercisetraining session because we want her to be alert and walking on a loose leash not pulling and running all over the place so she tends to be in Work mode for walks which is great for her mental stimulation. We also have a fenced in backyard and we taught her Wheres ABC?! where ABC is either my name or my husbands and shell run around chasing us. I also take her for at least one long hike every weekend  usually  hours  and that wipes her out for about  days. It was different when she was younger where it sometimes felt like she either slept all day or never calmed down but she now gets at least  minutes of exercise a day if not more and goes to daycare  times a week where she plays with other dogs for the full day plus the long hike on the weekends.Just know it WILL be hard the  month age is EXTREMELY difficult but its so worth it.

10318207,0,t1_dcdg239,The bottleneck in the breed with those  individuals was way back in . This means theyve been actively inbreeding for fiftyfour years at this point. The average inbreeding coefficient of a Lundehund is . which is wild considering you get a COI of . when you mate siblings  and a COI of . is considered the threshold for an extinction vortex Not to mention that . is actually an improvement that is the product of decades of active attempts to get the Lundehund COI down!Lundehund syndrome is also a complex polygenetic condition. It isnt something that can be easily tested for and bred away from like DM or EIC.Outcrossing programs definitely seem like the right solution to heritable health problems facing certain breeds of dogs I found this recent article about the Lundehund outcrossing program and it really does seem like on paper theyre engaging in some great collaboration and really taking the right approach. HOWEVERThere are only about  Lundehunds worldwide in the genetic pool. Even with outcrossing that really seems like an insufficient population size for really getting away from the complex issues that plague the breed. Especially given that the outcrossing program is still in its early stages and the dogs it produces arent eligible for the main registry. No matter how good on paper this outcrossing program is for the Lundehunds it sadly strikes me as too little too late...,dogs,dcdmi0f,3,t5_2qhhk

10321894,0,t3_5ns1wd,I tend to follow loosely this rule with animals in general. I once was trail riding and my ordinarily extremely bombproof horse started balking. I tried to pushed her past whatever it was and she eventually did move to the side a few feet and walked on for me  while I looked over and saw a snake in the underbrush. Always trusted her from then on if she said no we didnt go and she was one of those really solid confident horses who never said no to trivial shit.Now Im sure my dog has said no to trails out hiking for reasons that are actually harmless. I dont care I still dont push him  hes avoidant and reactive to dogs so the likelihood is that hes reacting to the smell or sound of a dog on a certain trail and I dont want to put him through that. Its for his comfort more than my safety these days but I see no reason to force him to go down a route hes said in the only way hes capable of saying he doesnt want to go down. ,dogs,dce1kr5,2,t5_2qhhk

10332797,0,t3_5nwndd,We brought home our Golden Retriever in August he was  weeks old at the time. The biggest advice I can give is that management is the key. If you dont want him eating an destroying things he shouldnt make sure theyre not within reach and that the dog is in a crate or exercise pen when not being supervised . Some pieces of advice The puppy blues are real and exhausting. We planned for our dog for over  years and I still was frustrated with just being around him for the first couple of weeks because he was so much work. It gets better. Potty training takes a lot of time and consistency. Initially we took Summit out at least every hour in the middle of play sessions at the end of play sessions when he woke up from sleeping and  minutes after eating or drinking. If you have a full time job make sure you find a trusted friend that can help you out with this initially. At max puppies should theoretically be able to hold it for their age in months plus  so a  month old puppy can hold it for  hours max. The more opportunities your puppy has to potty in the house the harder potty training will be. Make sure to invest in enzymatic cleaner Natures Miracle is awesome.  Crate training is a life saver. Expect it to take some time at first and for there to be some crying and screaming on the puppys part. I strongly recommend signing up for puppy kindergarten classes ASAP. Theyre extremely helpful in creating a bond with the puppy helping you see that others are going through the same struggles you are and helping to give your dog proper socialization.  Socialization takes a lot of time energy and creativity. In order to have a confident adult dog you will need to introduce your dog to a variety of different types of people environments objects and experiences from an early age. Their prime socialization period unfortunately ends around the time that the puppy finishes its vaccinations so you will need to find ways to socialize your puppy while keeping him safe from diseases such as Parvo virus avoid pet stores parks and places frequented by other dogs. Having a young puppy can feel extremely isolating. Its a huge responsibility and leaves very little time for hanging out with friends going out and doing nondog related things at first. For the first couple of weeks we had Summit the longest I felt comfortable leaving Summit home alone was for  hour. I used that  hour to pick up more supplies from the pet store. As hard as it is when theyre young its all worth it in the end when you have an awesome older dog. At . months Summit is exactly the dog we wanted. Hes sweet confident adventurous friendly loving cuddly and well on his way to earning his canine good citizenship CGC certificate,dogs,dcfa3c2,5,t5_2qhhk

10376106,0,t3_5oktzd,While I think its nicer to have a onetime refundable pet deposit the vast majority of the rental units in the Northern California region often have both. The refundable deposit can be as high as one month rent to as low as a few hundred  plus a monthly pet rent  per animal. These costs can be a huge barrier for pet owners however this is the sad norm for this region.I think what is reasonable is putting a limit on the number of allowed pets per unit. You dont want to promote animal hoarding. If the owners arent sure where to put the cap there are often county or state laws regarding animal ownership that can guide the policies.Because many people dont take the time to do CGC letters of reference could suffice to give the landlord information about the behavior of the dog. Asking a few questions in a survey would also be helpful Is the animal housebroken?  Does it have a history or episodes of aggression? How long have you owned the dog? Has the dog any informal or formal obedience training?Requiring proof of vaccination and instating a costly penalty for owners caught in failing to pick poop is ensures everyone stays healthy. Owners could also insist that tenants have renters insurance that has pet liability coverage and keep a picture of pets in the tenants file for records.Things that could be installed on the premises to promote dog friendliness allowing owners to install doggie dogs for suitable doors e.g. not the front door to give access for animals providing poop bags and a trash can on a pet waste station specifying a particular area of the complex as a pet area.,dogs,dck7165,4,t5_2qhhk

A question about rescue though  Ive been looking at Paws New England and it looks like you have to basically adopt a dog via pictures and written descriptions as the dogs are mainly being fostered in Texas and elsewhere in the country. I could no way pick a dog from pictures not knowing how it would react to me or getting to know its personality  but Id hate to have one driven across the country only to find its not my dog?

I was  years old and wasnt expecting to be hospitalized. Just like if you suddenly walked outside got hit by a car not wanting this to happen I dont wanna jinks you! and then are hospitalized. Your dog starts growing a tumor after this hospitalization. Youre unable to work for at least  months and you lost your health insurance and income. But its a rough patch. You can go back to work in six months right? Surely youll get back on your feet then. So no need to surrender your dog because its only six months.

10412440,0,t3_5p1guh,Is it possible the vet was just taking their time to do the exam and trying to stay calm and quiet to not upset the dog? Either way it sounds like a new vet cant hurt but we just switched to a new vet we like very much and I could see her process being described very similarly to what you described. Honestly it sounds like you are very nervous about what this dog might do which the dog is going to pick up on and the trainer is an excellent suggestion either way. She may not have offered the dog treats if she thought it was too stressed to take them. As for the food is there a reason youre worrying about carbs? Dogs dont need them and generally get all their nutrients from meatorganseggsbonesveggies. Edit and FWIW though we started with a different vet our newer dog barked lunged and air snapped at every person that used to come in the room. With a lot of training and building trust he did his first exam with the new vet last week and was a total gentleman. ,dogs,dcobg6t,1,t5_2qhhk

When you buy extra big blankets chairs and pillows because you cant leave them out of all the cuddling.Boxer You often hold loud arguments mostly in gibberish multiple times a day with them.  drool and slobber is suddenly the best method of cleaning your face and floors. You and all the other dogs lose their personal space and become chairs at any given time You often catch yourself saying dont lick that multiple times especially in public when they start licking the floor and displays. You often look like someone beat you up after playing due to their clumsy paws and big heads.ACD mix The stares oh my the stares. They never falter. The sonic boom barking becomes just another background noise. You find  yourself thinking of ways to out smart your dog because theyre similar to human teenagers in thinking. You and your pillows become the safehaven for their toys and chews and you frequently awake to squeaking from under your pillow. ,dogs,dcohqmz,5,t5_2qhhk

A few points of note...  These dogs have attacked a pet cat on the cat owners property. Chasing and harassing others as well as getting ontointo other peoples property. Theyve torn a screen door destruction of property Theyre susceptible to getting hit by a car bus or be killed by other wild animals. This is bad for the animals and welcome to rdogs where you can presume people care about dogs. We live in the south and plenty of people have guns and are willing to use it. These animals are offleash and out of their owners control which is illegal in my city mind you. There are plenty of dogs that wouldnt take so nicely to two strange dogs charging up to them on the street.  Dog fighting is alive and well in the south and plenty of dogs are taken as strays or stolen and tossed into the pit as bait dogs.

10438284,0,t3_5pgew2,Pronin is the goto drug for this issue. Its what most vets will prescribe. Its not without side effects and you often have to increase dosage as your dog ages. Google side effects so youre aware of what youre getting into with the drug. Ive had two dobermans on it post spay and would turn to it now as a last resort.Whats happening is you desexed your dog before she was mature and youve thrown her into surgical menopause. This can cause the sphincter muscle that controls the bladder to get weak and leak when shes relaxed. Pronin is a synthetic hormone that helps tighten up that muscle again. Read some articles on Dogs Naturally or Whole Dog Journal for reasons to not spay and neuter early. This of course requires a more vigilant owner during heat cycles but vets are just starting to understand the overall health importance of those hormones. My suggestion would be to research the drug and interview other vets. There are some alternatives to Pronin. They dont work as well but you could explore some if you decide Pronin isnt what you want.My other suggestion would be to look for any other causes. I have a post spay  year old sighthound that started leaking urine when she slept. Before putting her on Pronin I found an integrative vet who helped diagnosis a narrowed sacral bone that impinges the nerves when shes inflamed. I use acupuncture and Chinese herbs to keep her inflammation down and she doesnt leak urine. So I saved her for now from a lifetime of Pronin. I also spayed her much later at nearly  years to ensure shed gotten all her initial hormones but could not find a vet to do an ovary spaying surgery. Or I was talked out of it actually.For future reference also research waiting on spaying andor improvements in ovary sparing spays. ,dogs,dcr94kv,-1,t5_2qhhk

If you want a pom cross the only ethical way to get one is from a shelterrescue.  The people who breed designer crosses are pretty much in it for the money and the dogs you get from those type of breeders are quite likely to have health and behavioral issues due to lack of health testing and lack of socialization poor care even neglect.  Id highly recommend not supporting these types of people and getting your pom cross from a rescue if you decide on that breed mix.,dogs,dcro03c,3,t5_2qhhk

10451236,0,t3_5pnlnf,Yikes. Ill pitch in because Ive raised litters and their mom peaced out at four weeks once the teeth came in.At four weeks you want to train to a surface. I used shredded news paper. Just shred it with your hands. It is very absorbent and cheap. The idea is to teach the puppy about clean areas such as the bed. This clean area will be built on at  weeks to work on crate and potty training. At four weeks the puppy is still on automatic. By using the paper you are teaching the puppy a terrain to go to the bathroom on. Dogs are very associative. This is why potty training works and why dogs kept in houses and not let outside are so hard to potty train.You need to use a play pen and appropriate surfaces hence the paper for inside.Going outside if you have a yard or some basic dog free area is fine. You dont want them in a high traffic area where a dog may have used things. Puppies have some immunity from their mothers. That is why some breeders start vaccines around  weeks since the pups are weaned and their immune systems are starting to try to pick up the slack.What puppies do to each other to discourage biting is very hard to replicate. The most successful tool you have is ignoring the puppy. Say ouch turn your back and act unhappy. Remember dogs read body language and yes dogs understand some human body language. Weve been breeding them for centuries to do so. Remember this ignoring is about  seconds. Puppies have no attention span. What you want is your puppy to come nuzzling and seeking attention. That is apology. You can begin playing again.Have lots of appropriate things to shove into his mouth when he nips. Nipping is both exploration and teething. He is in his first teething phase now.He is not aggressive. He is a predatory animal that has been domesticated. Growling shaking things biting this is all play and expression. Vocalization is normal and healthy. Remember that a dog is not born fully developed but continues to develop as they grow. Their eyes finish forming after birth this is why they are born closed. Their mother licking them and even their crawling on each other helps stimulate nervous systems and circulatory systems. You are not dealing with a dog right now you are dealing with a developing infant. They just develop quickly.You can teach him to sleep alone but Id not do that this young. Id move the sleeping alone back to  weeks. If you do want him sleeping alone you need a warm water bottle and a toy for him to sleep on. They have substitute toys that you can get for puppies. He also needs a heat source still. I used a red light that covered half the sleeping area so that they could adjust their temperature as they needed to. By six to seven weeks they are doing better but still need a warm draft free area to sleep.Remember the pup is developing fast. Next month you will have a normal eight week old puppy to work with. In two weeks youll have a six week old puppy who will be more mobile and active. Right now however its baby puppy time.,dogs,dcsqwan,98,t5_2qhhk

10556550,0,t3_5r3k1r,The FBI maintains a database of people convicted of animal abuse. Im not sure to what degree they share it with local law enforcement agencies but rest assured anyone who has been convicted of abusing an animal in the US is known to federal law enforcement. For good reason.Unfortunately that doesnt mean they can assist with local prosecutions of animal abuse cases and they certainly cant influence the penalties for those convicted. Further even if a person was on some sort of list or registry unless there is jurisdictional law proscribing that person from obtaining another animal or such was a condition of their conviction it would be illegal for a rescue or shelter to deny an application for adoption based on that criteria alone. The situation becomes even more complicated when you consider that what the owner of a boutique dog breed on the upper west side of Manhattan thinks isanimal abuse is likely different than what constitutes abuse to a rancher in Lubbock Texas.Its up to individual communities to decide. In my county for example its illegal to keep a dog tethered outdoors for more than one hour in any  hour period regardless of weather or access to food andor water. Im fine with that but Im sure there are areas in the US where this would be considered ridiculous.So there have to be laws that are consistent with local custompractice. But once that has been established there needs to be a legitimate emphasis on enforcement and the community must agree upon penalties to which the convicted are subject. If there are no laws in your county or state that prohibit the adoption of a dog for example by someone who has previously been convicted of any kind of animal abuse a registry is meaningless.,dogs,dd4pd0u,7,t5_2qhhk

Youre right that its probably good to take a step back from socializing him with other dogs out in public for now but theres still a few things you could do like take him for a ride in the car sooo useful getting them used to this and generally being away from the house and maybe visiting or inviting over a close family friend or relative that doesnt have pets. Overall I would say that the break from socialization didnt hurt my dog. Hes also a timid dog but he warms right up to people if given time and the more time he spends around other peopledogs the more comfortable he is when he meets new ones.

10601757,0,t3_5rqlq3,Hey something I can actually answer! Since you didnt say where you are Im going to assume you are from the US? some basic infoTo actually enter those AKC shows youre going to need full registration. If you have limited reg you would have to ask the breeder to switch it for you. For AKC shows they do have to be intact since the purpose of conformation is to evaluate breeding stock. However the UKC offers altered conformation classes with points towards ALT CH and in a much more casual environment too! Honestly UKC would probably be the way to go with what youre looking for.The competition in goldens is tough in AKC. Usually they have the most entries in shows I go to. Its also pretty heavily a handler breed aka a lot of dogs are shown by professional handlers. Not as much as some breeds but a lot. So just be aware.The closest thing to the casual show youre looking for would be a match. The AKC hosts sanctioned A and B matches and as far as I know you dont actually have to have full registration for this I did this with mine before his registration was switched. But no points are earned for these shows and it seems like there usually isnt a lot of competition I won a best in match with mine! Over like three dogs. But hey one was another golden. But it was a lot of fun so you could try to find one in your area theyre listed on the AKC website.I dont know about neutering for matches but I feel like its probably a no?As far as training look for a conformation training class in your area where you can learn to stack bait and gait your dog or if theres none around you watch videos. An important thing I almost forgot GROOMING. This is kind of a big one. You cant win without it. Now that were serious about showing Kev we have a grooming table dryer multiple brushes spray shampoo a admittedly cheap case of shears aprons towels and clips plus a dolly to transport it all. All put together it was probably upwards of . This is pretty much the bare minimum you need to actually show with real competition too. Now you dont need all this for matches or UKC but he has to look nice in the ring at least bathed and paws ears and tail trimmed. Hmm one more thing get a cheap Mendota lead. Worked great for me and surprisingly strong.Good luck!,dogs,dd9hnsg,8,t5_2qhhk

10617316,0,t1_ddb2s00,I believe the hike is much shorter because its just a small like hill type mountain I wouldnt really call it mountain its like a slight incline by our apartments. Usually they are gone maybe a good  minutes. Next time they go I will probably time how long they are gone tho. Five is the max amount of time I take him out for those short bathroom walks it can be  depending on my daughters temperament. They are pretty slow walks just from my apartment door to the other side of the apartments which is small and back to give him time to get fresh air and to use the bathroom. We used to live in a house with a backyard so maybe Im overcompensating? I mean hes lived in an apartment before but that was when he was really young.

Maybe try swapping from a kibble to a loaf for a while. Keep playing around with various ingredients. Some people find that grain free food works. But also look for other things that may be triggering it. Maybe hes allergic to some plant in your yard or his blankets are too itchy or maybe he doesnt like sleeping with his collar on.

10629918,0,t1_ddcagmh,Hell be  in April. Hes been coming with me regularly for a year and a half and came in occasionally for bathsnailsetc for the previous year and a half. He is really good. In the beginning he wasnt sure of what he was expected to do there. He was super curious and super nosy wanted to check everything out inspect the place for spare food etc. But after a few times he got the routine. Hes really good. I have one of the crates set up for him with a fleecy mat and a water bowl. First thing in the morning I torn him loose in the shop before the clients start to arrive and he wanders around for a few minutes until hes had his fill and then he crates himself. He is generally content to stay in the crate all day even with the door wide open. Usually he comes out only for a minute or two to stretch his legs or ask me to take him outside. If we have big dogs coming into the shop I do close the door for his safety. I recently had to put a big dog in his crate because we were out of room so Cy got to hang out on the floor for a bit and he was actually kind of whining at the other dog for being in his spot. Lol.He does not bark growl or get possessive of his crate or water dish or bone if I bring him one. Its actually very easy to forget hes there hes so quiet and unobtrusive.A few times toward the end of the day he has come out and chosen to lay down on the floor instead of in the crate I guess because its cooler. Clients like seeing him and hes perfectly happy to politely say hi to them. He works hard,dogs,ddce8ig,4,t5_2qhhk

This being said I probably have a higher tolerance for this kind of stuff than most people.I personally would say it isnt sustainable if the medication isnt long term. I wouldnt go into the surgical realm simply because the costbenefit on neurological surgeries just isnt there for me. It could all get worse it could have no impact etc. Just not a bridge Id go down.

It is extremely intimidating to be approached by multiple dogs and know that you cannot move get away create some distance. The majority of the fights Ive seen at dog parks are because a dog is brought in on a leash and it freaks the fuck out. If youre going to an offleash dog park the leash needs to be off.

It needs to stay clean. Small soaks in some warm soapy water after hes outside and limit his outside time. Personally I like using diluted chlorohexadine Vets will usually prescribe a short round of antibiotics to help ward off infection since dogs do things like tramp in poop and whatnot. If you choose not to go to the vet be vigilant about checking it for infection every time youre soaking it. If it starts turning red looking pirulent or developing even the faintest smell you need to get him in ASAP. Dont wrap it it needs air. Dont put anything on it. ,dogs,ddh2e1p,2,t5_2qhhk

They recommend you do  weeks so you can get every module. As theyll have a new discussion and exercise for every module focusing sound desensitizations walking with your owner and trading for treats are all things I remember learning but we took so many classes there they all start to blend in They have a mandatory orientation before you can enroll in classes where they talk about their class and why they think positive reinforcement makes you a better trainer and how to train with your clicker effectively. So you could technically do  nights a week if you dont mind repeating modules as theyll give you the homework for each. I think Sunday is the week switch over for modules? No problem we did so many classes with our puppy it was a little bit much I think. He definitely benefited from it and I loved how tired he was after classes. The two other places I Toronto were Raising Rover also included play time for beginner puppy and also I really liked the Petsmart  laird and Eglinton. Its apparently the best one in Canada Julian is the trainer there and hes awesome.

10684236,0,t1_ddhzjm1,Im inclined to disagree...Im sure most dogs do enjoy the ride and that their owners mean no harm by it. But driving with your dog in the bed of a truck especially down a highway in TX where the speed limit is  mph is incredibly dangerous. You get in an accident your dog is thrown from the bed and dies. You brakeswerve too hard your dog can also go flying. Your dog sees a squirrel or something jumps out and gets run over. Cross tethering the dog right behind the cab could be acceptable but I have literally never seen this when a dog is in a truck bed.  of the time they are totally unrestrained at least where I live. The only reasonably save method is to have your dog in a kennel in the bed of the truck and to have the kennel firmly secured. ,dogs,ddhzxw7,5,t5_2qhhk

10757755,0,t3_5t7nom,Dry skin! No fun... unless youre a lizard. Then youre probably at the reptile dermatologist saying but my skin still looks soft and lustrous! Help! Anyway the fatty acids are a great idea but there are a few metabolic things that can cause this as well. Low thyroid is the first thing that comes to mind but it could be allergic or parasitic as well. If theres itchiness or redness get it checked out. The vet might do a skin scraping or blood work depending on how it looks. A final thing to consider is that if the dryness on the ears was on the ear tips Id get that checked out too. That can be a sign of a condition called vasculitis which could be serious. Oh and stop the Vaseline because it could make the dry skin worse. I like oatmeal shampoos can sometimes be soothing too but that wont stop the other dog from licking at it.,dogs,ddpkyxm,1,t5_2qhhk

The dog should still have a waistline when viewed from above even if they dont have a tuckup when viewed on profile.It doesnt help that they have terrible metabolisms but love to eat.

Also familiarize yourself with the symptoms and act as soon as possible if you see them. It is a very serious and deadly disease that can cause permanent damage to the liver and kidneys even if your dog does recover. My sisters dog got it two years ago in an area where it was uncommon. She became very lethargic and wouldnt eat or drink. Vet sort of misdiagnosed it as acute kidney failure since lepto was uncommon which technically it was but that was more of them symptoms than the disease. Two days of being hooked up to fluids and about  later dog made it through without much damage.,dogs,ddser43,2,t5_2qhhk

10790042,0,t1_ddsf6dw,First I want to say that estimates for dental work are tricky because  its super dependent on location and practice costofliving type of facilities services included in addition to the extraction etc. and  dog teeth cant be assessed just by eye you really need xrays to determine whether a tooth has to be extracted and how complicated the extraction is so the cost estimate can be really off.  I think in my dogs case the costs are on the high side because we live in a  area Bay Area and I wanted to go with large hospital with modern equipment and  emergency services due to my own anxieties.Our presurgery estimate was  for stage IV periodontal disease.  This included preop bloodwork  anesthesia  pre and postop xrays  ventilator and continuous monitoring of vitals  IV fluids etc.  various painkillers postop visit dental scaling sutures  and of course the extractions  per tooth depending on the tooth and complexity.  However it ended up being  since there were some unexpected findings and procedures oronasal fistula repairs and a whopping  extractions.  In total I spent  since she had to take additional meds and get some more bloodwork done at the postop visit since they found some elevated liver values during the preop blood panel.  This is definitely a procedure thats worth getting a couple estimates for if youre concerned about budget.  Also you can try talking to the shelter or rescue about it especially if you think youll have to get other medical issues addressed right off the bat because it can really add up.  My dogs rescue offered to pay for the procedure since they would of gotten it for her if I hadnt adopted her but I didnt end up taking them up on that because I could afford it and I felt the money could go to another deserving dog.,dogs,ddsx0bh,1,t5_2qhhk

10823879,0,t1_ddwdd9r,Hehe yes your comment entirely summarizes all of the emotions Ive felt with my SIL and Lulu now Churro! in the past . years. My husband didnt understand it and it drove me crazy. Im so happy to see that others can empathize with me. I dont think I was very clear enough in my post! Churro is absolutely definitely ours now. I wasnt very explicit in my post but those are the email discussions I mentioned. And I wouldnt consider changing her name if I didnt know confidently that she was ours hehe. I have it in writing that she has given up the dog to us. This is all very recent  like just in the past day!I am also hoping that now that I know Churro is absolutely ours I will begin to develop a love for her like I do with Taco and Nacho. I guess I am just sadconcerned that I dont have those feelings yet I really appreciate your two cents and for making me feel validated for all of the negative feelings Ive had about this whole thing   To answer your questions she has not contributed any kind of money for Churro. When she comes back from school she cares for Churro the way she had in the first five months that she did own her mostly just coddling forcing her to snuggle when she is not in the mood Churro appreciates her own space and carrying her around like a baby.

10823972,0,t3_5uou89,gt A couple days ago my friend brought over his new puppy and I had to put my dog in the back yard because she was being mean to it and Im honestly not sure what she would have done to it if I hadnt.Its not uncommon for older dogs to not be willing to put up with young dog antics for many very good reasons.  This article does a good job of helping people see it from the dogs perspective You dont say how the pup was acting but by what youve written her tolerance for the antics of other dogs is very low.  Its quite probable shes hurting somewhere.  It could be aches amp pains of age or it could be a lingering injury from the dog attack incident.  You said you felt the area she was bitten and she doesnt react. She could have easily wrenched something deep in her neck or shoulder.  Those are the kinds of injuries that dont cause reaction by pressure but  are painful when the dog does a movement especially if its a quick one.  Old dogs can also develop arthritic changes in their spine amp hips which can can be painfully triggered by movement.  For example when another dog comes up to her and she needs to move her head it may give her a shock of pain.  Not enough for her to yelp but enough that she really dreads and hates interaction with other dogs. It doesnt even have to be pain.  Older dogs dont have the same balance and can get worried about being knocked around.  Did she go to the vet after the attack or since then?   Anyway she is trying very hard to get the point across that she cant deal with dogs right now.  All her actions have been defensive not offensive. The fact that shes escalating means that she desperately wants dogs to stay away from her.  She needs you to have her back and you need to protect her.  Do not let dog run up to her or touch her.   Edit at the end of the article is some good advice on how to proactively protect your dog.  Right now her only defense against other dogs is herself. If she knows you will protect her she will be more able to relax and not feel the need to force other dogs away.,dogs,ddwf09q,1,t5_2qhhk

We tried it all too limiting food or water making sure she went out numerous times.  After a while we took a big risk we decided she is less of a puppy now and let her have full roam of the house.  Funny enough every since we did that she hasnt had a single accident.  I dont know if she just got anxious being in a smaller area or had separation issues.  I am not sure what the actual fix was but this has held true for about  months now.

10946358,0,t3_5wassc,Google golden retriever husky mix? That kind of fits also. One thing I noticed that doesnt fit with any of the breeds mentioned are the freckles on the front paws. They remind me of the normally black and white freckles a border collie would have on their paws. Well other breeds have it too like Aussies or Cattle dogs or Setters and some Spaniels however it is a distinct pattern that hints at a certain breed. Just dont know which one.  Either way I agree just because cute doesnt make a dog a good fit for your family. Think of what is important and then do some behavior tests with her like take a big stuffed animal and scare her with it. In a playful manner. Is she straight up attacking it will she back off but then come back to explore it hide behind you... Just google behavioral tests for puppies. You dont need to push her too much as some of these tests suggest. Some are kind of questionable so follow your gutOr let her bite your arm then wince if she doesnt back off it does show a lack of compassion or sensitivity to others for example. That wouldnt make her a bad dog but you can assume certain things from a test like that. And lastly the one thing that I found to be one of the most difficult to train is when a dog has a very strong prey drive. Like many huskies would have. Maybe find a prey drive test. Sorry lots of thoughts ended up rambling but thats what happens when looking at cute puppy pics. ,dogs,de91fib,2,t5_2qhhk

Age is going to be a bigger factor in holding her pee than the door. Me going and peeing every hour or whatever doesnt change the fact that I can hold it for  hours if I actually had to aka road trips where I wont use a public rest room.The inout game sounds more attention seeking than I need to pee.,dogs,dea07gz,19,t5_2qhhk

Vets recommend you only induce vomiting if  If the substance ingested was poisonous Unfortunately AleveNaproxen IS poisonous Recent ingestion e.g. your dog just ate grapes less than an hour ago Your dog is asymptomatic meaning hes not showing any signs of the poisoning at all Your dog is healthy and isnt at risk for inhaling the vomit into his lungs e.g. he doesnt have previous medical problems like an abnormal airway e.g. laryngeal paralysis collapsing trachea etc. an abnormal esophagus e.g. megaesophagus etc. or isnt brachycephalic e.g. he has a smooshed face and is more at risk for inhaling his vomit into his lungs. Brachycephalic breeds include the following English bulldogs Pekingese ShihTzus Pugs etc..For dogs keep in mind that the only currently safe and recommended at home product to induce vomiting is  hydrogen peroxide.In general the dose of hydrogen peroxide in dogs is approximately .   ml per pound weight. So for your dog that would be  ml.

In the past if she doesnt like an action being taken she has growled as a warning as well. Today was different though I was leaning in to give her a hug and without any warning she bit me. So so many bites start as well the dog always tolerated it before. The dog warned you by growling and it never worked as you continued to hug her. The growling did not get you to let go so she found something that did. You know what a dog growling means and chose to hug anyway even with a bite history. The other bites are much more concerning. Most level five bites would result in dogs being put down unless cared for by a very competent and dedicated owner.

11089265,0,t1_deoxo93,A quick search of some of the tests indicates they can look for wolf coyote andor fox. But beware If your dog does turn out to be a hybrid and is said to have a certain percentage of wild animal this can have legal ramifications for you. If you knowingly have a wolf hybrid in some areas that is illegal and in others you have to have a special permit. Also small animal practitioners are legally forbidden to treat such animals again without a special permit. So weigh this information carefully before deciding how much you want to test this curiosity as certain results could mean big changes for how you live with your dog. ,dogs,deoyimu,3,t5_2qhhk

11098812,0,t1_depbn8w,Fellow German here. Not sure if it already has been mentioned. But you should be fine. There was a Bundesgerichtshof ruling that stated that only in very unfortunate circumstances a landlord can forbid you to have a dog. Certainly sand in the hallway is not a good reason. In fact you dont even need to ask permission to own a pet unless it is a Listenhund. The ruling states that it would be unfair to renters to not have the same choice as people owning a place to have an animal and therefore a landlord cannot forbid you to own an animal. There is a similar ruling when it comes to smoking. A landlord can also not forbid you to smoke even if it is unpleasant for other renters to pass by your flat because of the smell. And this even holds true if there is a clause in your current contract. Honestly renter protection laws are pretty strong in Germany and you shouldnt worry. Write a nice letter to your agency letting them know when you clean the house and that you do everything possible to keep the hallway clean in a reasonable manner and send them some pictures of the hallway after you cleaned it. They cant really do much except of hiring a cleaner.  Final thought edit If you are still a bit worried you can contact the the Mieterbund or your local Verbraucherschutzzentrale They can give you advice. But really they cant even prove it is you or your dog being responsible for the dirt or a friendly neighbour with mud wrestling as a hobby or another neighbour not performing his cleaning duties. I would be surprised if they would be allowed to put up CCTV  privacy laws in Germany are also very strict. ,dogs,deq1h5n,6,t5_2qhhk

11126118,0,t3_5yv4by,gtDoes bathing a dog daily have any drastic affect on humans allergies?No. Not really. Depending on how severe the allergy and what exactly shes allergic to bathing is just going to give you a really clean dog and a stillallergic wife. Your wife will need to see an allergist to figure out how to best cope with a dog. Since your wife has allergies she should meet the dog in several different situations to test it out inside the foster homeshelter one day outside the homeshelter on another day to see if theres something else or another dog inside the building thats setting her off rather than that dog specifically.gtHow old is too old for a safe dog? Is a  month old as easy to influence as a  month dog?This is kind of a weird question. In general the younger the better for training. But if youre rescuing there are plenty of older dogs who have already grown up around children and do well with them as well as younger dogs who are already reactive and aggressive around little ones. Your best bet is finding a dog at any age who is currently being fostered in a home with small children and asking a lot of questions about temperament.,dogs,det4wph,6,t5_2qhhk

11163453,0,t3_5zcspa,First I agree with the other posters that you unnecessarily escalated things and it was not the fault of the dog. Your authoritarian stance toward dog ownership makes me think youve chewed and swallowed the nonsense about dominance training methods which are pretty terrible for dogs and not nearly as effective as positive training methods. But you are asking about what to do moving forward so here goes Do not put down your dog. If you no longer feel you can care for the animal please call a rescue describe the incident and ask for help rehoming your dog. It sounds like a wonderful family dog that would thrive in a different kind of training environment.  Consider beginning training again using positive training methods not just as a solution to a problem but as a way to relearn to communicate positively with your dog. Positive Training builds a relationship between dog and owner. Many dog owners think training ends after housetraing and basic manners but why? Dogs love learning new things and its fun. Who knows what you could teach your dog to do? It doesnt matter what you choose as long as you are learning fun things with your dog. Im teaching mine to boop me on the nose. Why? Just cause. Its cute and were having fun.  Once youve boned up on positive training methods with easy stuff like sit and come teach your dog the command go to your crate. you may want to revisit crate training entirely as a dogs crate should be a place of comfort and safety not punishment. Ive got an airedale terrier and if I can train that breed to go to crate on command its definitely not impossible for you! ,dogs,dexd66m,8,t5_2qhhk

11174335,0,t3_5zjpoy,Oh gosh.  It is really hard to say.  It could go either way.  Have you considered dog daycare?  If the barking is an issue due to neighbors another dog may make matters worse as they may make a lot of noise playing together.  Although to be honest studies indicate dogs actually dont do a lot of playing together when there isnt a human around.  Isnt that funny?  Having the company of another dog COULD have a calming affect and help with the destructive behavior but there are no guarantees.  Plus you shouldnt leave them alone together at first until they have gotten to know each other well and you are certain they will get along.,dogs,deyljyv,9,t5_2qhhk

Adoption clinic policies vary but if he is not put down instantly for the title the chances of him being adopted again are slim to none so he will not have a very good or long life there. If he stays with you he will for sure have more incidents. Some states have laws saying that after a certain number of bites your dog must be put down and he has had two incidents ? in two years. You have lucked out that nobody is pressing charges or suing for bills. It sounds like the rescue agency is the best home this dog can ever have.

I worked at a dog daycare with a poor college kid that had adopted a blind AND deaf dog and brought him to work and he had a blast. Sure he bumped into things but he played and cuddled and she did everything she could to give him a fulfilling life. He was a happy dude and she loved the heck out of him.

I do think they should think twice about promoting things like puppy mills which that breeder very obviously is or shoddy practices. Its like starting a shark fin fad to clear your skin or something.

11297514,0,t3_6182t7,I have a Furbo its normally around  but I got it in the Black Friday mix up where it was priced down to . Honestly its fun for  but I would have been pissed with it had it been .It has a decent camera night vision camera microphone bark alert and a treat dispenser. I love being able to check in on my pets and the bark alert is great because it gives you a notification when the dog is barking. It lets me check in and figure out why he is barking.Mostly it works well except the treat dispenser which tends to jam or spill out too many treats even using the ones that came with it. It plays a sound that you can record when it throws a treat though so I ended up changing that recording to my interrupter sound so that I can stop behavior without turning the mic on and confusing the crap out of my coworkers.They also claim it cant be knocked over the combined effort of my cat and dog had no problem knocking to down to get the treats out. The fall broke it but the company sent me out a replacement within the day so props to their customer service.Treat dispensing aside my main complaint is that if I dont have it right on top of my wireless router I cant get a consistent connection. Even  inches away it craps out all of the time. Which kind of defeats the purpose of being able to check.So my conclusion is when it works its a nifty little tool but it only works about half of the time.,dogs,dfck1bo,2,t5_2qhhk

11326293,0,t3_61mge1,I see no issue with having a larger dog in an apartment. The only problem you may have is any breed andor weight limits set by your complex or landlord so make sure to doublecheck.I lived in an apartment for years with my small dog. We saw plenty of large dogs huskies golden retrievers labs etc over the years that seemed happy as can be. A decent walk before work say  minutes or so would help. I think it would tire the dog out a bit and theyd be ready to go back to sleep once you left for work. Hiring a dog walker for a potty break one or twice during the work day. Then an evening walk which I think would be beneficial for you both. It is a good way to unwind after work and gives the dog a chance to stretch their legs.You could also look into a dog daycare once or twice a week. I took my small dog to one a few times a month for a change of scenery for her and she absolutely loved it. I couldnt walk through the parking lot fast enough to drop her off. She was so excited to see her friends. As far as barking Id look into working with the dog on any separation anxiety. Kong toys are good for this as it keeps them busy. I was worried about my small dog barking when I left for work and asked my neighbors to let me know if it became bothersome. Everyone told me it wasnt a problem and it was expected as part of apartment life.I think I saw more medium to large size dogs in my apartment complex than smaller dogs. I did have neighbors that had two medium sized dogs that their only exercise was walking down the stairs to go potty. Lack of exercise caused the dogs to have so much pint up energy that they started lunging at people and barking at anything that moved. Proper exercise is essential for every dog regardless of housing situation. It sounds like youre on the right track. Good luck with your search.,dogs,dfftejv,3,t5_2qhhk

11329929,0,t3_61nher,How to be calmer in tough situations dont raise your voice stay calm all around dont take it personally and to just wait it all out find a gentle solution or ways to manage the issue calmly. Still cant quite relax on command but I can calm myself down much faster.Its okay to just drop everything and go walk or play a quick round of fetchtug even if you have ten things due in one day that should have been done a week ago. Speaking of that I should really be working on those things...Poop vomit blood pee huge insane messes etc will happen just pick it up and move on.Being more gentle and slow and watch body language more closely. Working around dogs everyday has really made me be more attentive of body language and watch myself on how gently I approach situations especially with more timid and fearful dogs. Sure I watch it at home mostly when play becomes rather rough or I know one of my three is on edge but when it comes to other dogs I do things much more slowly and with a much sweeter tone of voice. Its really helped me with people in more social situations to just take things slow since I panic in more confrontation higher stress situations.,dogs,dfg88lt,4,t5_2qhhk

11376731,0,t3_62cmqv,I dont think it is the breed to be blamed here. Ive not had a Staffie but Ive seen many around some of whom have been friendly with my pup some not. The problem is with the type of people who tend to get this breed because they are scary looking but then dont bother to train the dog or establish a good relationship with the dog. I dont want to generalise but I generally see a lot of dodgylooking people with this breed in the UK. I also know there are many responsible people who have the dogs and I truly believe Staffies can be good dogs and I dont think they are dangerous just because they are Staffies. But when you are in a household where no training is done and the owner is a regular drug user who may or may not treat the dog well I dont know if you can expect a fully healthy situation with a dog. And to be honest any other reasonably large breed could have just as well killed their owner many dogs are strong and big and if they are raised or trained poorly can be a danger to anyone. ,dogs,dflj7dg,6,t5_2qhhk

Several people looked at the pedigree that had more experience than me and said it looked good. With  years of studying and experience before getting this dog I can say that I know how to read a pedigree. The dog had real formal training at several behavior centers some in different states.He was  weeks and one day old when he left his litter. I visited him and he was with his mom and littermates. I dont know how old he is now. I stopped tracking his age when I got rid of him. edit He also lived indoors with my family and was an only dog in my house.

11399319,0,t3_62mea4,I second the ignore him option. When he jumps on you turn around and give him your back do not give him any attention. Dont say no or push him off you or acknowledge him. Continue to ignore until he has calmed down. When hes calm then give him some calm attention. All visitors to the house must also adhere to these rules.Greetings need to not be exciting. Yourself and all visitors should keep entrances as uneventful as possible. If you make a big exciting deal about greeting him as soon as you come in the door he will continue to be over excited.My dog also used to jump and go crazy when we came home and he has separation anxiety so he was really really excited when we got home. By strictly enforcing the boring entrance policy for several months we got him to stop jumping as soon as someone walks in the door and calmly wait to be greeted.,dogs,dfo3joq,1,t5_2qhhk

11473388,0,t3_63pvn3,Absolutely do not use an electric collar for two reasons when a dog is in an aggressive state he needs to calm down and focus.  Getting shocked increases agitation and will ramp him up  opposite of what you want.   When dogs are in an aggressive state they strongly tend to associate the shock with the object of their attention  not with their own actions.  It confirms in their mind that they had good reason to not trust that personanimal and will be even more pissedoff and aggressive the next time.  And so using a shock collar to control aggression tends to backfire big time and make the problem worse.  ,dogs,dfwi51q,3,t5_2qhhk

11520017,0,t3_64fsl8,You sound like great candidates for a Bichon! They are healthy sturdy dogs that have a history of getting on well with or tolerating cats. Theres a few Bichon rescues in California such as this one if you wanted to go meet some in your area.Cavs and French Bulldogs both tend to have much more significant health issues when they are found in rescue because the overwhelming majority of dogs in rescues have been bred by puppy mills or backyard breeders neither of which will health test or structurally evaluate their breeding stock. With Cavs you have to watch out for heart issues which can come on very quickly and early on in their life. A good breeder wouldnt breed a Cav who had a severe heart problem at age two but a puppy mill and a BYB would. With Frenchies you have to watch out for eye problems and breathing problems. If a breeder isnt structurally evaluating their dogs they produce dogs that are often more extreme and off standard and a puppy millBYB isnt going to be evaluating them.So your best bet in finding a healthy rescue dog is with Bichons. They wont be risk free but the deck is stacked better in their favour.,dogs,dg1snh0,6,t5_2qhhk

That way he smells you have something more in your hand and should linger longer for it. Start small  seconds whatever you think he can do and build that up.

11564643,0,t3_651eoh,I have an  year old pit mix that Ive had in several rentals since Ive gotten her and Ive done a few different things to ensure that shes okay wherever were living. As a preface shes a sweetheart who has literally never met a stranger or dog she didnt love and is very good at reading dog and human cues I.e. leaves unfriendly dogs alone and stays away from humans that dont want her near. So I am as certain as I can be that she would never cause undue attention to herself. She was listed as a pit mix at the shelter so it was on all of her paperwork. I asked my vet if I could get her breed switched to a boxer mix which is my second guess of breed on the paperwork and they had no problem even saying they did that for their own dog. Like your apartment both of my apartments had many people with dogs that looked even more like a pitbull or banned breed than mine. It was just nice to have something in writing saying she was a nonbanned breed. While looking at individual listed houses for rent I found that writing a note andor offering to have the owner meet my dog helped. Ive had  landlords allow me to rent on the condition that they meet my dog. I also volunteered phone numbers of previous landlords that could be used for references.

My previous dog was an American Stafford  great Dane mix and my current dog is a super soft charactered collie mix. I think i went through the same rough patch as you did where i was just manhandling the poor dog. It was relatively easy to fix!Heres how i would approach it if i where in your shoes Stop avoiding the dog. duh Find things that drive your dog most. This can be food can be toys can be affection. Could even be contact with other dogs. Use that to reward the dog from now on. Forget the happy high pitched GOOOD BOOYYYYYY and everything else you probably learned. Do not correct your dog using your voice. Do not talk to your dog at all. Use only soft energy. For inspiration look at videos of mother dogs  handling and correcting their puppies. Ive learned that using my voice is fine with most dogs but insecure dogs will trust me faster if I dont talk to them. Only pet her when she approaches you. Did you know that just an angry look at a dog will already make an impression?  Take the dog on long walks adventures if you will. Do not bring your other dog or your wife. You need quality time filled with positive experiences and just joy overall in order to rebuild a relationship with trust. I found after each walk my relationship improved. Mind you these are walks where i find things that challenge the dog. My current dogs loves to dig holes in the ground to find roots and play with them so thats what we did. You can play hide and seek you can throw a ball for hours on end. You can go swimming. Just find something that your dog likes and make it a special adventure just for her. Again dont talk to her during these walks.  When you do get home in a situation where she pees dont say anything. Ignore her completely. Just clean it up and pretend nothing ever happened.  Fearful sensitive dogs need to be on a schedule. If this is possible for you make sure your dog knows exactly on what time of the day shes fed shes walked and when you come home. Establish routine especially at those highstress moments. When you get home is a crucial example of this. Make sure the dog knows exactly what to expect from you at moments like these.Again you messed up. Time to fix it. Its possible that recovery takes months but its also very possible to fix this in a matter of hours. I dont know the dog or you well enough to give you an estimate.

Depending on his level of tolerance at being held  Id pop one arm around his neck and one around the trunk of his body and hold him firmly to your holder. This leaves his scruff for you to jab!Did that this morning. I sat on the floor instead of the bed like we had. Got a firm grip while my mom injected. She was a nurse so she knows but holy heck giving insulin to a pet is hard. gt  I usually take a pretty sizeable tent of skin as this means you have plenty of room under there. We are lucky that dogs have different connective tissues under their skin so we have a lot of wiggle room for injections. You are just aiming to get under the skin  pointing at too far of an angle down will end up in the musclefat. Its a very slight angle down or straight at the bottom of your skin tent.Thats what I did. I reread everything you all said and did it that way.

Commercial raw diets are extremely common these days in the US AAFCO approved pressuresterilized etc. Very safe to feed for the dogs and the humans. If people ask me about switching their dog to raw my first recommendation is for them to try a commercial diet first while they learn all about how to prepare balanced raw diets themselves if they want to eventually make their own. I wish people would stop frothing at the mouth about raw being inherently unsafe and unbalanced. Lots of people shouldnt be making their dogs food because they are simply not educated on the subject. That doesnt make all raw unsafe. In my area we have a very happy rawfeeding community and while a lot of them do prepare their own meals it seems like the majority buy commercial raw diets and feed those exclusively or as supplementation to kibble. ,dogs,dg84t6s,2,t5_2qhhk

Believe me nothing teaches a young dog not to mess with cats like ONE bapsmack to the face from kitty claws. Idealy this just teaches the dog ok this thing is not to be harrassed Our dog from months to  year would periodicly bother the cat. But one bap is enough to make him stop and respect her personal bubble for a good while after that. As for getting your dog used to the cats Dual Treatgiving works if everyone is calm. Cat treats for the cats dog treats for the dog fed to each in the same room. So the dog will be distracted and not fussing the cats and the cats kinda get used to the idea that hes not so bad after all. Getting your dog used to being around the cats while not directly interactingfocusing too much on the cats.IT wont magicly be an overnight friendship but getting all the animals comfortable around eachother goes a long way in the relationships later on. Our dog now licks the cats head and the cat brushes against his legs. They lay together on the floor and peoplewatch from the window together.

Rather than audio recordings Id suggest setting up an old smartphonetablet with Manything iOSAndroid app which automatically records video when it sees movement or sound. I think itd be more compelling if you were to show them short clips vs.  hours of audio. If youre worried about escalation and poisoning and whatnot the main way to stop it is talking to them. Theyre not going to like stab you in their door way. Talking to people is hard. Talking to people and not arguing with them is hard. Just based on this reply you want to show them that youre right and theyre wrong and crazy. Theyre never going to understand that. Just look at any political topic or even think back on arguments youve had. A pile of evidence doesnt change peoples entrenched views. Ask them whats wrong make them feel like they are being listened to show them that youre working with them again you can even list things youre ALREADY doing because they have no idea and try to resolve conflicts peacefully. And if it doesnt work and they are just beyond any form of reason then youll know that too.

Getting the balanced nutrition in a raw diet that a good high end kibble comes with already is very tricky and getting it wrong leads to malnutrition and so on. It takes a lot of reading a lot of research a vet that actually has animal nutrition taught recently a lot of finding out which fruits and veggies to add to the meat and bone and organ bits finding suppliers that even SELL organ bits beyond tripe and liver and on and on and on. It is very difficult to raw feed RIGHT so .. as much as I like it and like how it helps my dogs I dont usually trust myself to get it right.,dogs,dga0s9m,2,t5_2qhhk

I think these breeds have the energy drive and biddability you want but without issues with guarding instinct. They generally should have good off switches but youll want to talk to your breeder about that since things can depend on lines. I know you said you were most interested in herding breeds but I think most of them have some degree of guarding instinct. Aussies for example are described in their standard as being primarily a working dog of strong herding and guardian instincts. Groens are much less intense than working line Malinois but they still share characteristics  its more a matter of degree than a totally different breed. Protectiveness is one of them. ,dogs,dggddrc,7,t5_2qhhk

11669816,0,t1_dgio1qv,gt I was told by a trainer that if I try to totally eradicate growling and barking she wont have any warning signals so shell just go from anxious to biting with no warning. Do you think this is reasonable?Dogs who growl are far safer to be around than those who do not. You always want that warning signal. Having said that? gtWe had an additional runin recently with a guy in my apartment complex trying to physically corner me and intimidate me and she was perfect. She stood between us and anytime he took a step forward she growled and put him back in his place but she didnt pursue him and didnt try to bite him. The only time she barked and lunged was when he tried to put his hand on my shoulder. This is not a service dog. You cant take this dog out in public knowing that she is that defensive. gt but she has a very low tolerance to the amount of time that were in public and she freaks out whenever anyone tried to get near her. Thats a dog who will one day bite someone. You can own a dog like that and manage them just fine but you cant take them out to work around people who are clueless AKA most humans and expect that nothing bad will happen. Odds are it will. Dont think that training this dog and conditioning her to be ok around humans is something that will make her totally safe to be around for other people. You might be able to make her so that you can rely on her to not start in with someone or lunge or growl but you will always have to remind her to behave and look to you for leadership. Ill be honest if I was the boss of the place you worked in and I read your account of your dog I would not be comfortable at all with you bringing her to work. Again people are clueless around animals and at some point your dog is going to feel threatened and resort to biting or attempting to bite. So yeah no good answers for you I would own her behaviorgt Then later that week  even though she has perfect boundary training  she opened the front door of our apartment and chased him down the hall. No no she does not have perfect boundary training and honestly? Shes a dog. Dogs do dog things. We can think theyre perfectly trained and then they do That Thing that we thought theyd never do. Look I get it. You want to be able to take this dog everywhere and claim shes a SD. But she is a much loved pet that has some funky wiring. And if you keep bringing her places shes going to show you how funky it is. A service dog should never ever ever show aggression towards humans or be overly protective to the point of chasing someone growling at them or trying to bite them. Think about all you have written heregtThe issue is she is terrified of new people. Anyone near our car anyone that tries to pet her in public anyone that comes into our house or the house at my job she barks and growls at. Again thats not a service dog. Thats a dog you love who needs to not be put into situations where shes over threshold and where shes going to bite someone. You need to understand her and advocate for her. If she bites someone no one is going to care that she is your selftrained service dog. ,dogs,dgisffz,2,t5_2qhhk

For example you mentioned Rottweilers Dobermans and GSDs which are all guardian breeds. Rotts bark less than the other two and have slightly lower energy on average. Dobbies are supposed to be velcro dogs. Rotts are generally more independent. They still love their people but dont need to follow you around so much. I suspect GSDs are also more independent than Dobbies. Rotts can be stubborn. My neighbor was a police officer and he told me they use GSDs rather than Rotts because Rotts tend to be more stubborn as well as  pounds larger.,dogs,dgko869,3,t5_2qhhk

Now they are lbs not huge dogs but they still jump up when someone comes to the door. Sucks when we have guests. I wish we had taught them not to do that.,dogs,dgqrh1u,3,t5_2qhhk
11742044,0,t1_dgqssfk,I think doing your due diligence with the breeders you choose is really really important.Going through the official breed club going to events and talking to people who are involved in the breed  sports conformation etc.  will give you an idea of what kinds of people you should be working with in the breed.  Many breed clubs make their member breeders sign a code of ethics that should be followed before they are allowed to be listed.  There are instances where good breeders go bad  they start doing things for profit become hoarders because no buyer is good enough for them etc. so current knowledge from people involved is so incredibly helpful.Being able to look them and their activity up on social media breed club publications or through trusted contacts within the breed goes a long way to making sure youre not getting a dud of a breeder.  If you start bareminimum with advanced level health testing on all breeding dogs not just vet checks but current OFACHIC results you will more than likely be looking at a breeder who is at least some sort of ethical.In the introduction email to my future breeder I told her I already looked up her dogs on the OFA database and because she is very proud of the health of her dogs she thought it was really great that I did that and further discussed other future pairings health testing results.  Most recently a female dog they bred  years ago passed her health screenings and they made an entire Facebook post dedicated to that.The line of ethical and nonethical can sometimes be hard to parse since there is no definitive line but after your recent experience being a bit tougher on breeders and getting community vetting and opinions from multiple people you respect can help you a lot in making a decision.  A few owners were really excited to refer me to a breeder who makes great dogs but I personally felt the number of dogs she produced would make it tough for me to get the feedback and level of involvement that I wanted as a firsttime owner in the breed so I started looking in a different direction.,dogs,dgqzo68,8,t5_2qhhk

11764111,0,t1_dgsrhy4,I really hate those cutesy descriptions. I totally understand that their purpose is to refrain from scaring adopters away but you have to be realistic when youre bringing an unknown dog into your home. I would be absolutely fuming if I brought a dog that is okay with cats but just needs a little bit of training and the dog mauls my cats the second he comes in the house.Some shelter descriptions that Ive seen and their translations would be best in a home with no small children  I tried to bite my owners  y.o and thats why Im here would be best in a home without cats  I will try to kill your cat would be best in a singledog home  I will try to fight your dogI attacked my owners other dog and thats why Im here needs some time to come out of her shell would be best in a quiet home  Im fearful and phobic of any sudden movement I was abused with a fork and a plastic bag when I was younger please coddle me is very energetic and needs a little training  prepare to have your clothes ruined when your dog jumps on you and prepare to be dragged down the street on walksI shit you not I just went to a shelter website in the area and found a description on a dogs page that was along the lines of he loves food toys and treats so much that he would prefer it if there were no small children in the home he hasnt learned to share yetJust say the dog is a resource guarder and cant be around smal kids before a fuxking kid gets bit in the face!!,dogs,dgthpdr,24,t5_2qhhk

11778307,0,t1_dgv2nra,Uhhh I dont know why you think I have something against bully breeds. Its an absolute fact that shelters will mislabel bully breeds and bully mixes in order to get them adopted because of the stigma associated with the breed in areas theyre legal and because of the laws banning them where theyre illegal.The biggest reason why I never went through with working at the shelters nearby is specifically because in their orientation they stated that they intentionally mislabel bully mixes as Lab x Boxer in order to get them adopted. This is disingenuous and irresponsible because someone who gets that Lab Boxer cross does so with the belief that it will behave like a Lab Boxer cross.What they wind up getting is a dog wig potentially high prey aggression and dog aggression which they were not equipped to deal with or werent expecting to have to deal with when they got the dog.I just want shelters to label dogs they think are bully breeds as bully breeds or bully mixes.We have enough people on here claiming their obvious Lab x Shepherds as Pit Bull mix its ridiculous. Go into any dog breed ID thread and youll see at least one comment claiming its a Pit mix.Behaviour assessments are not reliable in all cases because dogs behave differently in shelters. Shelters are also unreliable in their honesty of past bite records.,dogs,dgv3x1l,3,t5_2qhhk
11778967,0,t3_682qm2,Thats not a responsible breeder I am sure they have a reputation but no one is responsibly breeding any kind of doodle. They look like a small scale puppy mill with the amount of upcoming litters. That is an extremely early age to alter dogs my guess it would be so they can ensure no one uses their dogs to make money breeding.

Adopting into a house with a calm older dog would probably be a very large benefit because she can learn from your roommates dog but you will want to make sure she doesnt get overly attached and can live without that dog once your roommate moves away.A strict schedule a quiet and predictable place to take walks and a quiet household with few visitors will all held tremendously.
