1299217,0,t1_cietz0g,Also can we get a stickied mod post where everyone updates the progress of their matches so for those who progress know the current status of their next opponents grouping? It would make scheduling much less of a hassle if everyone knows the progress being made. I imagine a lot of people wont knock out three matches back to back so if you know how many matches your next potential opponent has completed in their current round it would make scheduling much easier for the upcoming rounds,AxisGBA,cifs1ih,1,t5_3157x
