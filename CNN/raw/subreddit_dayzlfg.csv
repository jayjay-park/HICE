8732977,0,t3_4zbv1x,Whats up bokeeNSooner or later I would look to join a group with experienced players. Ive got a few quick questions. Where and how are you guys playing most of the time?  PP or PP  Public or Private KOS often? never? always?  RP? Also what do you guys think about uploading footage on YouTube? I do upload a video every now and then not too often though. Is there a clear rule that this isnt okay? Like for privacy reasons of some members or not showing strats publicly? Or would that be okay? Or just depending on who you play with? Thanks amp have a good oneRePatch,dayzlfg,d6x9o61,1,t5_2u8cy
