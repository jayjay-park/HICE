653090,0,t3_1yg8lc,Hey I am F and am looking for a roommate to share my awesome brba apt in a highrise right on the chicago beach!  It has a fully updated granite kitchen and both bathrooms are marble.  The huge sqft apt  is a corner unit on the top floor so we get awsome views of the city night lights through the wall to wall windows across the dining room living room and both bedrooms.  Parking is available in the building or street parking is available too.  Redline El train is  blocks away so we are just a few stops from all the nightlife in Lincoln Park Wrigley Gold Coast Navy Pier or anywhere else you want to go. Here is my craigslist ad for more info and pictures. Contact me if you think you may be interested.Sarah,chicagoroommates,cgei86u,1,t5_2ro5u

I dont bring lots of guests over unless I maybe throw a bbq or a special occasion party which isnt too often  most of the time Ill go out if I want to get a little crazy.  Definitely not a party girl Im more into relaxed casual hangouts.  Social drinker nonsmoker but  friendly.  Ill be working in a restaurant in Lakeview or on a boat in the Harbor or both while trying to navigate the theatre and film scene.  I like indie folk and punk music hockey games theatre and a good bit of Netflix binge time.
