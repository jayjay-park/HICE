3049131,0,t1_codn5mb,Since your followup is getting down voted ill respond hereHow about anywhere in GTA which would be presentable to white people who would be more accustomed to nicer sitdown places.Im just being straightup with my comment. Take it harshly if you want but theres no such thing as a presentable Indian restaurant that I know of which wont have shit food at the same time. Youre trading one for the other it seems.Sure there arent many high end Indian restaurants in the GTA but it doesnt mean you cant sit down and enjoy a nice meal without compromising quality. As for the white people comment Im going to assume you dont mean you want Indian food that is toned down. Also sounds like you really havent done any research. no offence.Okay some ideas. I kept it fairly close to the core.Copper ChimneyAvenue road near  this place specializes in south indian food. Spicy flavours lots of vegetarian options good wine selection.BindiaThis is the newest under a year Indian restaurant in the city at market street. Its a very nice looking place owned by a couple. They serve regional Indian food just a little toned down vibrant flavours and dishes lots of tasty stuff. Also IMHO one of Torontos best Indian chefs Debu Saha just returned from Quebec and is consulting in the kitchen in the back. Great winesdrinks Dhaba King streetThis place doesnt get enough love. Its located in restaurant row and gets most of its traffic from the lunch crowd and tourists at night. Skip the buffet and order a la carte. I would have to say that this restaurant is the most consistent Indian restaurant in the downtown core. If you dont want to venture to Brampton or Scar this is where I usually go for a good quality meal.Jaipur GrilleMidtown yongedavisvilleThe last time I ate there I will admit I was more smitten with the ambiance and party than I was with the food but i hear its quite good. Its gone through its ups and downs but Im hearing recently that its hit a stride again. Great wines.BaburQueen west by duncan.

4800639,0,t1_ctzmc7f,It was AYCE and when we first arrived there was three tables of two seated with one already eating but it got busier as we were there and by the time we left there was only a few tables empty I think.As far as I can tell they were dragging their feet to reduce the amount we would eat which worked as we didnt bother with dessert and left hungry. We had spoken to staff twice at the table and once at the counter after waiting so long with no food but it didnt help.No apologies no discount on the bill no explanation and in the end no tip. Im the type of person that would legitimately feel guilty for a week if I didnt tip but I felt ripped off beyond any restaurant experience Ive had and am honestly upset the other person paying with me tipped anything at all.,FoodToronto,ctzns1j,2,t5_32w53

7811325,0,t3_4m9fst,If youre going to go to the island buy your ticket online. It says you gotta print them out but you can just have them scan the barcode on your phone. Walk all the way past the super long line of silly people who dont know any better to the very front past the ticket booths and show the barcode. Bypass the line look like a boss enjoy the islands. Hanlans point does have a clothing optional beach area but its also the least busy and not all clothing optional. Highly recommend that over the rest.As for food Smith on Church st has a great brunch. Also go to Kensington market with an empty stomach.
