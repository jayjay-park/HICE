1269657,0,t1_cicg2es,Im partial to  Card Monte since its what I have built IRL but I have most of the cards for other decks too.  Only archetype I dont play because Im awful at it is storm.,MTGVintage,cicgbkz,2,t5_2zmb9
1391887,0,t3_2a1zva,Could someone explain to me why the Humans lists play a single Exava? I really dont understand the point of the card. Is there really no better hasty drop?,MTGVintage,ciqr5km,3,t5_2zmb9
2012165,0,t3_2hsrqz,They very well may not have.  I tried to join one Wednesday evening and it didnt fire.  Yesterday LSV and Randy Buehler tried to get one to fire but the best we could get was an man.  I also think its kinda sad that we cant even get Dailies to fire.  What are all the people who own Power online doing with it?,MTGVintage,ckvnvhn,3,t5_2zmb9
2071695,0,t1_cl2ycg1,Yeah the problem is all of the small tournaments is that they tend to have very localized metagames. But hell its something to talk about.,MTGVintage,cl35p55,1,t5_2zmb9
2127433,0,t1_cla8q88,Dagnabittit well it was just guess anyway. Thanks edit words,MTGVintage,cla8rny,1,t5_2zmb9
3567360,0,t1_cpy0t1l,Very valid.  Most results posted are by people going into a tournament knowing the meta and probably half of the players there if not more and approximately which decks those players will be using.Crucible isnt the best card but if you dont see crucible in G I dont think it is right to bring grave hate against Shops.  Its such a corner case.  The reason I advocate Martello over Terra Nova is that Martello can change gears very quickly.  A Tangle Wire off the top can swing a game back into the Shops players favour whereas Terra Nova cant really come from behind short of a Tabernacle after board.  No single card in it is as high impact as some of the ones in Martello.Martello also has an answer G to a resolved MentorPyromancer in the form of Steel Hellkite while TerraNova is weak to them.  A creature based meta simply Thorn loses a little of its value compared to other sphere effects.,MTGVintage,cpywm3b,1,t5_2zmb9
4042523,0,t3_36qd3j,I played BUG fish in the daily on Sunday. I went  but I felt good about it  one of my loses was to a monstrosity of a rouge deck.People are worried about the Mentor and Pyromancer matchups. I played  Illness in the Ranks in my sideboard and didnt have any problems.,MTGVintage,crh2u6b,2,t5_2zmb9
4281410,0,t1_cs7vw57,You dont understand what Im saying. The five Black Lotuses are the one restricted Black Lotus and four Lions Eye Diamonds that were unrestricted when that deck existed. In the words of MTG Hall of Famer Patrick Chapin Lions Eye Diamond briefly functioned as Black Lotus  contributing to the single greatest Constructed deck ever built.,MTGVintage,cs88fdc,1,t5_2zmb9
4355331,0,t1_csg3otz,True its like a totally different deck when it starts with sapphire despite my other comment I already made about null rod. And ancestral isnt useful if it draws a bunch more creatures you cant cast in time.,MTGVintage,csgkubp,2,t5_2zmb9
4596520,0,t1_ct9ys4y,City of Brass and Mana Confluence is an amazing idea. Then I dont have to buy into duals and I can play Grixis. Thanks a lot for this article! ,MTGVintage,ct9zdmt,1,t5_2zmb9

5236589,0,t3_3mpec7,Shops losing chalice means itll only be  of the top meta as opposed to  ...,MTGVintage,cvh76b3,0,t5_2zmb9
5252753,0,t3_3muukd,Well you only need to fill two new slots using Pauls list.  You could bump the of creatures up to  add something like Crucible or SoFI or Dismember main or something like a Triskelion.Dont worry Shops will still be very very good especially for your first event.,MTGVintage,cvj58gq,0,t5_2zmb9
5305660,0,t3_3nnw47,My favorite history story is all of the cereal names. Not Vintage relevant now these are historical decks.Fruity Pebbles was first. It was the combo of Enduring Renewal Goblin Bombardment and a  mana creature  white and red often with green as well and your opponent dies when you throw lots of things at them. The deck splashed black next for broken mana Dark Ritual and Necropotence and tutors. Now its Cocoa Pebbles.Then thats started the trend of combo decks being named after cereals. Next its Full English Breakfast and Trix which have no sense behind the names other than copying the past ones.Edit to add one more Delver. Still named after the first card that made Ux tempo viable in modern day Vintage despite Delver of Secrets not being all that central to the deck any more it really should be called Pyromancer Tempo or Mentor Tempo or JeskaiAmericanother name for WUR Tempo depending on the version,MTGVintage,cvpuyc5,2,t5_2zmb9
5418340,0,t1_cw48ywb,Why not? Its a fun card. A different form of card advantage than drawing a card worse in some ways and better in others.,MTGVintage,cw491jh,1,t5_2zmb9
5519118,0,t3_3qoqqi,Its much less viable than it used to be because creature removal is played maindeck.Used to be Hermit Druid could win Game  often on the back of forcing down Druid with Cavern of Souls and the opponent just dying to it. But the meta has enough creatures now that Lightning Bolt and Swords to Plowshares are legitimately viable in the main .TLDR Oath of Druids also costs G wins the game if you untap with it but is less likely to be killed. Play it instead.,MTGVintage,cwh48hu,6,t5_2zmb9
5537723,0,t1_cwjhowk,Would it be worthwhile for me to splash black for Abrupt Decay?,MTGVintage,cwjhr52,1,t5_2zmb9
5952938,0,t3_3wyk1x,Pretty much none of the staples are exclusive to that deck so I wouldnt consider it a waste to pick up fetches duals power etc. regardless.,MTGVintage,cxzyl5g,5,t5_2zmb9

8035940,0,t1_d3kyk5v,Tabak is useless and should have been replaced years ago. Hes inconsistent in his rulings but worse hes flippant and frankly rude to Wizards of the Coasts customers on a frequent basis. There are still several cards that need to have their behaviour properly reverted to what it says on the card. He is just so inconsistent about it. Half the time he says well we arent going to revise what card X Y or Z does when we add this new mechanic because when the rules change that means that sometimes cards work differently and thats just how it is. And then the other half of the time he goes well we cant possibly change whatever card e.g. Lotus Vale  when we changed the rules we changed its behaviour in order to represent how it worked at the time. Its so frustrating. And if you bring anything like this up he gives you a flippant rude response. ,MTGVintage,d4jbclt,1,t5_2zmb9

9669089,0,t1_da4tfhf,Well since mentor we have had eldrazi the rise of tks shops  colour humans and now paradoxical Storm and car shops.     The format is constantly changing it just can be missed because everything is centred around established archetypes. ,MTGVintage,da4x1pu,3,t5_2zmb9
10861137,0,t1_ddz6nfi,Hah! Excellent. Though it still seems weak to null rod with most lists Im looking at relying on bounce and not removal. It looks pretty insane though given that it slips in tendrils or tinker Or keyvault. How does it actually wind up playing? ,MTGVintage,de08zvw,1,t5_2zmb9
11400433,0,t3_62oh22,Havent seen it in a while but Chasm Skulker is surprisingly good when Gush is a thing.,MTGVintage,dfo83k4,4,t5_2zmb9
