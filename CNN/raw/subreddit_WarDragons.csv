10740577,0,t3_5tghnb,Sorry to disappoint you here. But there is no doubt amongst high level players that hunters are the best dragons in the game if you use them well. However they are the hardest to use well in terms of multitapping shots and dodging damage and therefore they are often unliked by lower levels.Post level  sorcerers are almost always useless. If you are in a good teamleague with defenders sorcerers are hopeless because they are too rage dependant and a good defender will make you know it.Warriors are ok however in the higher levels their DPS isnt enough to kill anything with appropriate defence.Hunters have the concentrated power to make a difference and with proper flying technique can often get through bases with little injury.,WarDragons,ddnt5ga,2,t5_37vn1
