4901317,0,t1_cuccdey,You bring up a good point. However my problem with roleplaying is if someone loses interest and just doesnt post the entire thread is left hanging and it can be hard to make developments. At least if people make stories its an instanteous development. Maybe we can open the option for roleplaying but if we want to have a big arc and someone wants to do a universal story they have to get permission to use charcters and have a vote? I just feel that roleplaying could be too complex. ,WhoWouldWinWorkshop,cuccl4y,3,t5_2zasf

5616588,0,t1_cwt9jkx,Its a semi genderless being so its not a huge deal. And that way its easier to lump into general God kings rather than kings and queens or something.This specific God king is like the god of ruling. In this world gods come from concepts. If the god of death died the concept of death would still exist and give birth to a new God. There were God kings before that created the concept of ruling which gave birth to this God king. So there were God kings but this is like the God king. Im undecided about whether she is the first of her kind.Im not completely decided but the witches I think will have originally been both male and female but eventually turned into a race of pseudogendered beings. Like how people say we all start out female even though that terminology isnt accurateThe extremely long term plan is for Gilgamesh to get sealed away as an act of revenge by the witches he drives out. Since he never dies the powers stay in people and are unable to be reborn. But the real story doesnt begin until Gilgamesh awakens far in the future not modern or anything various events keep technology from pushing forward too much Thats when the god kings return becomes central to the plot. The plan was definitely to borrow from the actual myths not just the names. But Im not feeling it any more Ill probably have similar names as kind of a reference rather than going all in with them.,WhoWouldWinWorkshop,cwtaitm,2,t5_2zasf

7289105,0,t1_d26ljmi,Yeah visible stitching definitely fits a medieval or fantasy theme. Youre not gonna get mechanically precise stuff for a while and leathers are especially tough.Similarly any armor should have straps somewhere between pieces or around the back like around the top of the forearm and under the wrist for a bracer. Even full armor wont be seemless and a joining cut would need to be added where the front plate and back plate meet.,WhoWouldWinWorkshop,d26q0c5,2,t5_2zasf
8889131,0,t1_d7gavow,gt I mean even Alabasta Zoro could defend against attacks like that.True I forgot about that feat.  Id put SS Kenpachi in . gt By how much?Enough that he fought two Captains and did alright.  That Kenpachi might honestly just be the same version that beat Nnoitragt Also where do your rank EoS not SoP Naruto? Im thinking .I dont really see any reason not to agree with that beyond the Yonko having no feats.  Im not so sure about th Gate Guys placement though.  Id put him in . since I dont think hed be able to take a decent number on any tier  member.,WhoWouldWinWorkshop,d7gcj2o,1,t5_2zasf
