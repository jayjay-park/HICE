3106907,0,t3_2mrfrw,My son was diagnosed as a toddler and in addition to TD hes autistic with a high sensitivity to flavored foods. Weve been living with TD for almost  yrs now and the one thing Ive learned is that everything keeps changing. The carb limitations are a great exercise in learning how to manage ones intake. The biggest lesson I learned in this exercise is to not substitute for nonfat our low calorie foods when unnecessary. The old clich everything in moderation comes to mind here. This just gets you to learn to consider what youre eating what amount of carbs youre taking in and where changes can be made. Before long youll learn to adjust your daughters scale with her endocrinologists approval to a sliding scale baseline plus x units for every carb exchange. The hard part comes in the beginning but it doesnt stay difficult for long. The important thing is to not become indifferent.Good luck.,T1D,cok133g,1,t5_2y8q6

7508432,0,t1_d2vhyu7,Thats another puzzle piece that I have yet to figure out is that no one in my family has ever had diabetes. Heart issues is the one thing thats remained a constant in the family genetic line. And that is another thing that has me keeping a very close eye on now. I have researched CGMs and pumps but never had the opportunity to speak with anyone about it. Ive looked into the Dexcom the Animus and Medtronic but am still such a rookie to it that I understand the purpose of it and what it does but I have read stories of people having issues with them or becoming too reliant on them and no longer paying attention and doing their blood draws like they still should. The doctor and my family think that my type  stemmed from taking a growth hormone called Nutropin AQ growing up. As Ive had such time off from work they really have made it hard for me to get back to work as they barely comply with ADA standards and researched some things one side effect of the growth hormone did not outright say Type  diabetes but the side effects of the growth hormone were hand and hand with your typical warning signs of diabetes. I thank you immensely for taking your time to read and reply. Really thank you so much.,T1D,d2vo5m7,1,t5_2y8q6

11341813,0,t3_61u8n7,I prefer glucose meter. Ive been T for  years. On a pump for  years. When I got a new pump I tried the medtronic cgm with less than desirable results. First the accuracy was pretty bad seemed to be  off on average. Second when sleeping it would give signal loss alarms multiple times at night just from being on the other side of my body. After that I felt there was little use for this thing as it was not very accurate was very expensive and you still have to test constantly anyway. ,T1D,dfhkpas,1,t5_2y8q6
