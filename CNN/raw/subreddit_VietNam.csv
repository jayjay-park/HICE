Apparently there have been major protests in Hanoi and Da Nang probably more that me as some random backpacker hasnt heard about. He also mentioned that the young people use Facebook to anonymously organize the demonstrations and separately during the conversation mentioned that a lot of people young and older would be off today because A its Sunday and more people are off work today as a result and B. school just got out for summer break this past week.Put all this information together and it isnt really surprising that Facebook wasnt working today.

1814976,0,t3_2f8xyi,The island resorts of Nha Trang are pretty amazing.  A quick google will give you loads of ideas.  There are dozens of resorts.  Scuba snorkeling jet skis fishing are all easy to accomplish.  Similar to Mui Ne it is very popular with Russian package tours but for some reason it does not seem as overwhelmingly Russian to me as Mui NePhan Thiet.  Nha Trang also offers the city itself which is a quick boat ferry from any of the island resorts and offers a bit of nice food and nightlife in case the  days of resort honeymoon need a bit of a change of scenery.  From Nha Trang you are well located to explore Vietnam points north south and mid country are all an easy flight away.  A good trip North would hit Quy Nhon a coastal town that has its charms and is fairly off the tourist path followed by DanangHoi An which can be a very romantic and interesting spot then on to Hue and finally Hanoi.  Sapa is a bit out of the way in the north but it gets rave reviews for its mountain beauty friendly locals and ethnic minority communities.   ,VietNam,ck7vx7o,2,t5_2qkcr
1835632,0,t3_2fkqfp,Im an Australian and Ive been living in Vietnam for about a year and a half with my Vietnamese wife.  If there are negative feelings towards us as a couple theyre hidden well as most people we deal with in our day to day lives are really friendly and genuinely accept us.  If Ive noticed any negative reactions its only been from a certain type of young woman ish who may glare at my wife a little but its the type that try to pick up foreign guys in bars so it seems to be more jealousy than anything they look her up and down and we get the feeling its like what does she have that I dont have?.  Overall weve never had a single negative experience as a mixed race couple here.  Im not sure how it would be for couples with a large age difference though as I find even my wife and I tend to judge when we see western guys over  with twentysomething year old Viet girlfriends I admit it  I know some may be genuine but weve personally known two couples like this and while the guys may be genuine the girls have generally just been after money or a green card  people in the west tend to judge samerace couples with such a big age difference anyway.  But like us the Vietnamese wont actually express any of those prejudices most of the time.As for the antiChina rights and any resentment towards China or people perceived as being Chinese Id say this is also not going to be an issue for you.  Yes generally the Vietnamese do not like the Chinese but this is specifically mainland Chinese  they do not associate Taiwan with them as its not Taiwan claiming territory they hold to be their own.  But even Chinese mainlanders are unlikely to actually experience any direct discrimination.  The Vietnamese are generally not keen on conflict and may harbour negative feelings but they will not openly try to push around Chinese even if they resent that they have to deal with them. But they wont assume your wife is a mainlander just because shes clearly not Vietnamese anyway.  The riots were a case of mass hysteria that got completely out of control thus the spread from Chinese factories to Taiwanese ones and even Korean or others but I can promise this would not be an issue for your wife.  I know many Chinese people who live in Vietnam who have not experienced negative treatment so while the resentment is there it usually lies below the surface and it takes a major incident to bring it out although once it comes out it becomes obvious how strong it is. ,VietNam,ckae0yb,2,t5_2qkcr

4568807,0,t3_3dm6nu,Common rule of thumb for medicine in VN is to look for the active ingredient of familiar drugs versus brand names.In your case Id ask the pharmacies particularly any one labeled Nha Thuoc Tay Western Medicine for Bismuth subsalicylate.Case in point a friend of mine needed Immitrex but we couldnt find it by that name until we requested Sumatriptan active ingredient wherein the pharmacist gave us a Russian equivalent that had a different name.Bear in mind that you may often get a different form of medicine tablets vs liquid for example depending on whats available or what you ask for. Make sure to consult the little leaflet inside all medicine packages usually there is an English side that lists what the medicine is its active ingredient dosage treatment and side effects and compare it to your more familiar one.And finally pharmacists in VN are a suitable alternative to going to a clinic at home at least compared to the States. If you go with someone who speaks Vietnamese and can properly convey your symptoms the pharamacists can usually diagnoses your ailments and give you the appropiate remedy. Though accuracy will often depend on where your pharmacy is and etc. I prefer ones that are near hospitals because they often are the suppliers for the hospital doctors and there is some overflow. In your case if  Pepto isnt available I might request something for an upset stomach.Cheers and stay healthy! ,VietNam,ct6idmq,6,t5_2qkcr

6345498,0,t1_czavyki,We didnt do any commercial tour and simply rented a motorbike driving all around Sapa and just visiting random places we drove by. Be prepared though most tourist attractions cost around  dong which is around  USD. Id recommend you to simply look up places on TripAdvisor and possibly the pinned thread over here and do the tour yourself as you can stop whenever you see beautiful places and are not bound to any routes. If you want to do a guided tour try to ask in your hotel or book it before probably the better option as you can read reviews about the tours  I personally dont think that the attractions in Sapa City are worth visiting though so you might rather go for a guided hikingtrekking tour. Some backpackers we met even went to a small village and lived in a homestay with a local family which is supposed to be a pretty interesting but also unusual experience if youre into that.In regards to Ha Long Bay we stayed on Cat Ba for  nights and probably due to the bad weather it wasnt that great for us. Im pretty sure that when the sun is shining you get beautiful scenery and amazing views but when its cloudy or even raining I dont think its worth it. Also most tours over there include snorkeling fishing or kayaking and we didnt really want to do that with temperatures closely to  degrees celsius. In addition after we decided to fly to the south instead of doing a Ha Long Bay tour my sister who was in Hanoi at that point told me that all tours over there were cancelled by the government at that particular day due to the weather so we actually were damn lucky not to book one.,VietNam,czawvh6,1,t5_2qkcr

7215250,1,t1_d1y9gan,Ill summarise as follows Their takeover sparked one of the largest exoduses in modern history. Some were economic refugees but the majority were fleeing to escape extant or possible persecution at the time. Among the refugees were also many ethnic Hoa Chinese who were targeted by the government especially during and after the SinoVietnamese war. Was this racism? Obviously. The comparison was supposed to show the level of contempt held by a large portion of the overseas Vietnamese population who are mainly boat people or their descendants. Just because the number of casualties isnt as high as in the Holocaust doesnt somehow relegate the suffering and contempt held by those who were forced to flee their homeland. After the wars completion over  million former ARVN soldiers and associates were rounded up and sent to concentration camps where they were indoctrinated and forced to do hard labour. It is estimated that over  died. All other political parties are prohibited and there are hundreds of political dissidents being detained at the moment some merely for posting blogs that criticise them. I am very grateful to be living in a true democracy where I can call the prime minister a dickwad and not have anyone come beat me up or lock me away without a fair trial. Is Ho Chi Minh evil? This is open to interpretation. Obviously people in Vietnam deify him but this reverence does not change the fact that his government did in fact murder land owners and other political enemies starting in the early s. Even if you revere Ho Chi Minh its not hard to see why people who risked their lives out at sea in search of distant freedoms would hold abhorrence to the idea that within their community would be a restaurant that is culturally appropriated by a Turk who although is in his own rights to do so ignores the history of the plight of Vietnamese refugees.Edit Its fine commie sympathisers crack me up. The amount of times I see others labelled as antiVietnam for merely criticising the government is startling but not so surprising. Its like they pay their sheeple to spout what only nitwits would. Anyone who defends a government that cracks down on dissent is worthy of the label of human rights backwater.,VietNam,d1ybg9s,0,t5_2qkcr

Getting a Vietnamese partner or a longterm expat who has a lot of friends would probably be necessary.Im not sure how easy it is to fly under the radar. I think it depends on how long youre planning to stay how much noise you make if youre planning to rent a place of your own that might raise more questions than staying with a friend or just staying longterm in a hotel whether youre taking a job that a Vietnamese person could do whether you have spare cash to grease palms that kind of thing. And of course you cant rely on enforcement always being lax. The rules are gradually tightening everywhere but enforcement is always the key variable.Yeah a bit of grey corruption can be useful  the unofficial fasttrack fee or the these arent the droids youre looking for payment its the black corruption the shakedowns or blackmail or the I wont do the job Im employed to do until you give me money demands that can be a big problem.

9695165,0,t3_5dea2o,Australianborn Vietnamese here  I just returned from Vietnam this morning! Spent  weeks traveling up and down the country and we flew between cities as we wanted to make the most of our time there. You should be able to book flights easily a few days ahead but beware of ticket prices increasing as you get closer to your departure dates. The airport ticket counters they will also show what tickets they have left for last minute bookings and the price. You will just need your passport with the visa stamp inside and bring this along with your itinerary confirmation number when you checkin phone is ok. We flew with Vietjet from HanoiPhu Quoc and Jetstar between HCMCDanang DanangHanoi and Phu QuocHCMC. No problems with Jetstar as the operated similar to the Australian arm. They are a low cost carrier so you will need to pay extra for checkin baggage or be slugged a large fee at the gate. They will also weigh your carryon bag to make sure its under kg. Meals and seat selection also cost extra but these are pretty short flights so it doesnt matter so much IMO. There were delays at pretty much every airport with the worst being HanoiPhu Quoc being pushed back by almost  hours without notice. Vietnam Airlines are better and more reliable if you dont mind spending a bit more. I found that the people can be quite rude and will push in if you leave even the smallest gap and bring their  family members in with them. They might be behind you on the transit bus but will push past you to get out first. No one listens to boarding announcements either ie. Children and back rows usually board first. Lots of these people are first time flyers so sometimes I found it really difficult. Some tips Arrive at least  hour before your flight as the checkin process can be quite slow and you may need to look for your checkin counter.   Make sure you hold onto your boarding pass with the bag tag sticker because they will check that the bag belongs to you as you leave the airport. Write down or learn how to say International quoc te or domestic noi dia. Im Vietnamese myself and didnt know the word for domestic airport so we were taken to the international one and had to lug my kg suitcase downstairs to the other terminal! Beware of taxi scams google this. Its very easy to get overcharged. Try to avoid this by catching only green Mai Linh or Vinasun taxis and even then there are fake taxis. There will be an official attendant wearing their uniform at the taxi ranks. A taxi from HCMC District  to Tan Son Nhat airport was about VND. From Noi Bai to Hanoi old quarter was about the same. Its not that far but traffic is crazy busy so that meter goes up pretty quickly!  Ubers are a lot cheaper than taxis though and you can also pay cash in VND. The Uber driver will call to confirm your booking so if you have a Vietnamese phone number remember to change it on your Uber profile. Have Google Maps open or at least write down the address of your destination on a bit of paper because most drivers we came across didnt speak English. My boyfriend bless him would sometimes try to speak to the driver but theyd have no idea. We mostly got by because I can speak Vietnamese. Learning a few choice phrases would help greatly or use google translate.  Remember the exchange rate. To covert from VND to USD cross off four s then halve it e.g. VND  approx. . Try to have a mixture of notes as they wont be too happy if you pay for a  purchase with a  note. Also the notes look pretty similar so dont get mixed up! You can pay in USD at some shops and hotels.Hope that helps! Feel free to PM me if you need more info. ,VietNam,da84v9h,5,t5_2qkcr

10697170,0,t3_5srimh,Contrary to the negativity youve received from others theres significant and lucrative opportunities for VietAmericans in VN. However youre not going to easily fine these opportunities on a job site even one as good as Vietnamworks.vn. If you obtain a CIS degree your advantage over a native Viet with similar degree will be that you speak English as first language and youre able to travel to the U.S. without visa issues. Many VN companies will want you as a liaison to foreign companies and especially with the Americans. They will pay significantly more than just being a programmer. You will be of even more value if you can speak fluent Vietnamese. North or south dialect is irrelevant.Also many foreign companies to VN will have expats as managers and pay them comparable to managers outside of VN. This leads to the blunt fact that VN companies pay foreigners more than natives. Personally I dont think its right or fair. Its just the way it is. The challenge is these jobs are usually not published. You will need to network your way in. Use LinkedIn to find people working for companies having a presence in Vietnam. Make friends and ask around. With a little luck you might find a company that will have a position for you once you graduate. Answering your questions more directly . You dont want a job in VN solely because of your degree. You want a job because you spoke English fluently all your life you can easily travel to the U.S. and you happen to be able to program to boot.. Its much easier to travel and live anywhere before you have a family. VNs cost of living is a fraction of the U.S. thus you could save more money if you live there right away.. HCMC has more tech opportunities than any place else in VN. However tech jobs and companies have spread across the country thanks to rapidly improving and expanding technology infrastructure. I would focus more on potential employers than where to live. . My family can live like royalty for less than  usdmonth in VN. Being single you could live fairly comfortable on month depending on how much you party and how many girlfriends you have. . VN dialect is irrelevant in tech industry because English is the standard universal language. Good luck!,VietNam,ddjc0la,0,t5_2qkcr

10849830,1,t1_ddz2bx5,I appreciate your story so thanks  it sounds very similar to experiences here in Hanoi in my last week. It was Pho that made my friend and myself sick that also irony. But it was made by the Dzao tribe just a little north of Sapa they dont consider themselves Vietnamese and actually get really offended if you ask them something simple like can u speak Vietnamese? because they have their own dialect. Weird because they live next to the black Hmong who again have their own dialect. Anyways point of our stories definitely is use your shoes to run away from the people who try to fix them. That is one example and many others where your holiday can begin to go South. In places like Vietnam Laos Cambodia Thailand etc it is normally inevitable to catch a stomach bug or travellers diarrhoea no matter how fanatical you are with hygiene. Airborne bacteria will get you and that adds to a point that can make your trip go south. It all adds up.

11185810,0,t1_dezuqyv,why did you feel the need to go out of your way to bash northerners when it isnt really relevant to OPs post?,VietNam,dezwcwo,-1,t5_2qkcr
11241646,0,t1_df5qqws,Thanks for the tip it sounds nice and I just might go there  I read that most Halong tours start from Hanoi but I guess they could pick me up in Dong Trieu? Would be nice to shorten the bus ride a bit and homestaysfarmstays are on my todo list anyway.,VietNam,df682te,1,t5_2qkcr

11319485,0,t1_dff0ud1,Sorry I didnt even mention the name in my dumb FB post I made about it. But I did get a pic of the steak.BTW Texan here so... we kind of know steak. This was an Australian filet butterflied. I swear Sapa is not that big and it was super obvious from the main road pictures of cattle and everything IIRC. Edit So in my infinite wisdom I didnt think to just google sapa steak house. Well actually I suppose I finally did. I am actually surprised that the reviews here seem to be pretty mixed. Either people do not know what a decent steak is supposed to be or I got real lucky. ,VietNam,dff1mbq,1,t5_2qkcr
11341977,0,t1_dfhl5qt,haha glad Im not alone in this. Definitely eases me a bit Ill give them a try and if not Ill just go ahead with getting it on my own if they generally function the same anywayThanks!  Ive heard its a great place to visit and very underrepresented in travel lists. I cant wait  Though its my first time out of the US Canada doesnt count so I may have a couple more moments of panic before and during the flight haha stay tuned!,VietNam,dfhlde0,2,t5_2qkcr
