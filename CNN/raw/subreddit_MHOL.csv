4699663,0,t1_ctmwpxy,I should just clarify here there is no second reading for motions. I will allow motions to be changed to include anything that was discussed for the vote if authors wish to include anything that was not discussed they must resubmit which would technically be a new motions but is pratically no different to a second reading.,MHOL,ctmxjvl,1,t5_33g2z

5407021,0,t3_3p3g83,My LordsOne tragic day in the middle of July I was sitting in my office at my home in Knightsbridge when I received dreadful news. My constituent and neighbour Lady Annie Truss the ViceChairman of the Royal London Society for Blind People was struck and killed by an electric bus while on holiday in Oxford. Lady Truss worked tirelessly throughout her  years in life to promote and spread the importance of awareness in our society not just through vision but awareness through our other senses. My Lords our country failed to reinforce the importance of awareness. Our laws and regulations left open a deadly gap upon which allowed Lady Truss to pass away. While the actions that occurred that day cannot be reversed we have the power to prevent these things from happening in the future. We have the ability to put in place regulation which protects not just those who are visually impaired but any pedestrians cyclists or motorists who simply may not be paying attention. This bill makes sure that all electric buses in the UK have devices installed in them which audibly alert the surroundings to its presence. It takes into account the intensity of the sound that should be necessary for people to hear while being within a safe decibel range. This bill will make busy streets across the UK safer for all.utrident ,MHOL,cw2t2cl,2,t5_33g2z

6523087,0,t1_czu0x1l,My Lords   The lorry drivers nurses firemen railwaymen and all the others went on strike because they were underpaid. It was not secondary action but each fighting for their own members.  This amendment has nothing to do with the winter of discontent but is a restriction of freedom of expression.     The Noble Lord should bear in mind that the seventies saw inflation rise to well over twenty percent. It was the way the government chose to tackle inflation which was the main cause of the Winter of Discontent. I hope that future governments learn from that mistake.,MHOL,czu1euc,1,t5_33g2z

6897218,0,t3_4a1tnl,My LordsBy all means create the Scottish Houses of Parliament! I look forward to it being founded being filled with totally inactive members having no nationalistseparatist presence that makes the houses neccessary growing quickly bored with legislating on such gripping matters as how much funding will the BBC get in  having no real Scottish input into election results remembering that Scotland is a prime location for foreign voters and genuine Scottish nonvoters are among the most hostile and finally with just umg contributing it eventually dieing.I do not like devolution to national parliaments a great deal. However if it must happen and it appears it must then let it be so. People have to get it out of their systems. I will end my speech with some lines from a great Scottish nonvoterDear MHoC CandidatesIf we wanted to vote in your shitey elections for Reddits Next Top Virgin then we would vote in your shitey elections for Reddits Next Top Virgin.Fuck off.,MHOL,d0y49gj,3,t5_33g2z
6972394,0,t3_4b754h,My LordsIs there evidence that middle class and upper middle class children are in need of this?

7162023,0,t1_d1s8jd4,My Lords Firstly may I thank the noble lord for welcoming me back after my  day hiatus. Secondly I believe there is much of Pakistan that craves a successful western education system and wile there is a violent minority against it   it should be done regardless  in order to build a better future for the youth of that nation which will lead to a more prosperous and modern nation of Pakistan. This would allow Pakistan to become more stable in the future with its youth supporting a moderate and tolerant future for the country were it can become the economic power house that would benefit everybody.  ,MHOL,d1s94in,1,t5_33g2z

7409995,0,t3_4grbr9,My Lords.  A government is elected by the people and they choose which party to give their vote to.  These votes dictate the number of national MPs and the number of party lords. So both have the same mandate from the people. It would be ridiculous to permit one and bar the other.          We must also consider the possibility that a Lord can be a party leader. If that party was elected. it is unfair that the party leader would have to resign their peerage if they wanted to become PM.       Therefore I urge all Noble Lords to vote Not Content.,MHOL,d2kgutn,6,t5_33g2z
