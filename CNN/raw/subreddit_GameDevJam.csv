4136609,0,t1_crrs7qf,Thats one of the main complaints so Ill definitely try and figure out some way to get the mouse to follow the ball. Ill test out your change but the idea behind controlling it with mouse clicks was to make it an active choice as opposed to a passive one. But Ill test it out to see how it feels.Thats actually a good idea. Ill probably create a halo or something instead to indicate the items that can be safely hit from the ones that cant. Ive got plans to use different colors for different behaving balls.Thanks for the feedback. Its really appreciated.,GameDevJam,crrsj6o,1,t5_37z0p
