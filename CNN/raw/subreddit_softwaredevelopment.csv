731896,0,t3_22jl6u,I build programs like this in Access on the side and with everything you rattled off youre looking at  figures easy. Without a better spec Id say in the k range. Youd be better off following tmortons advice.  That or diving back into Access. Its really the perfect solution for someone to DIY something highly specific yet still fairly small in database terms like youre talking about. It is easy to get lost in the weeds though.  Best of luck!,softwaredevelopment,cgngy2n,4,t5_2qhqc

3637836,0,t1_cq6oipy,Thanks for that mate its much appreciated. Im busy studying the various options now so will make sure to list the pros and cons of each. This project is for a start up so there currently arent any stakeholders or business to review the options once Ive mapped the options Ill probably try and engage with an consultant of some sort.,softwaredevelopment,cq6xvfa,1,t5_2qhqc

4888151,0,t1_cuafcck,I completely agree perhaps competition isnt the right word. What I wanted to express was the difference between profitizing existing work and using parts of a project for something unrelated that generates profit. uFaziri how would you feel about someone borrowing some novel decorator from a project of yours and using it in a profitgenerating project?,softwaredevelopment,cuaou3f,1,t5_2qhqc

5808688,0,t3_3up64e,gtSimply stated it feels like I cheated like stealing to me.think of it like this. you used tried and tested components to deliver a better experience.  you have probably introduced less bugs and less code you have to maintain to develop a better experience in your app. not that you couldnt write those components you used but it would take more time,softwaredevelopment,cxh4fe8,1,t5_2qhqc

9983434,0,t1_db8thtt,This is going to sound so corny and perhaps typical of a newb but Im excited to check that out after my daughters bedtime. I found a free mini coding course from Microsoft last night and book marked that too. Thanks for the encouragement. I ended up starting my FAFSA paper work today which is hilarious because I just finished paying back my loans from the first time I tried college. It was years ago but I just didnt pay them bad life decisions as referenced in my post but I finally started paying them like  years ago. I figure I want to get that end done so if I DO take my local schools web developer courses I can pay for it.Anyway Im rambling but thank you again for the advice and the good luck wishes. ,softwaredevelopment,db8vbd4,1,t5_2qhqc
