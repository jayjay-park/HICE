Heres my safest most passive strategy so far just camp out on the tiles right outside of the colored bank strip NOT on the colored strip itself obviously youll die.  You can see how lots of other people are sitting there.  Find a place where nobody else is if possible although those are rare now.  Coins occasionally spawn under you.  I got  HUC with one team last night doing that.  Then bank by walking one tile and move back.  You may still get blown up of course nowhere is truly safe.But yeah it may be diminishing returns unless HUC goes back up. ,beermoney,cfl6kcj,1,t5_2s5or

723210,0,t3_22fca5,I have two good apps.The first is featurepoints. You simply download apps from the list they give you for a certain amount of points each. You play with them for a few seconds to get credited and then you can delete them if you wish. Cash out can be anything from amazon paypal or free apps that normally cost a little bit. You can even save up enough points for tablets and other electronics. It doesnt take much to cash out either. Here is my ref code for an extra  points. ZMCQEThe other is an app called ride. You simply download it and it tracks how many miles you drive. Each mile is worth an x amount of points and you can cashout to amazon or a few other things. I have noticed however that it doesnt usually give me credit for all my miles but something is better than nothing and it is  passive after you download,beermoney,cgmhdj8,1,t5_2s5or

1190021,0,t3_27pqbo,Lets be frank. Both the SB apps are just awful. They are the most glitch prone crash happy poorly managed apps I have ever used. And yes I too am currently getting frequent frozen ads that must be manually closed. Everyone gets those sometimes it seems to go through phases of good times and bad. though it seems to vary from person to person depending on device OS luck possibly region and who knows what else. The laundry list of glitches also seem to come and go in phases.  Lately for me Entertainow has been getting frozen ads or blank white screen where an add SHOULD be every  or  videos and crashing at least once a day.  SBTV is just going appeshit on me not only am I getting the occasional frozen ad plus several full crashes a day but the app is also randomly forgetting who I am. Itll be playing the videos then randomly Ill notice the please log in to earn rewards message. Relog play videos a while until once more its asking me wait who are you again?.BUT in the end despite how horrible these apps are I continue to use them because they DO still pay out higher and faster then any similar apps. SO when you can get them to work they are worth using for that reason. as opposed to for instance PERK which rarely has issues running properly but pays out lower amounts much slower,beermoney,ci3hvgh,2,t5_2s5or

You get  minutes and  texts free per month.  This program is funded by the universal service fund a fee everyone pays on their phone service.  If you dont qualify look into a prepaid that offers pay per text.  Sure itll cost you like .text but itll be worth it.  The biggest issue is that you now need  number per account.

The date on the link also matched up with what I was saying and all of this couldnt be doxed.Youre misunderstanding how this would work. The scam would be that say I had an amazon code that I got from Perk. I trade it on GCX the transaction goes well then I do what you did to get my code back plus the money I received.In this situation it would make perfect sense that my name was on the original vcdelivery link. And all I would apparently need as it was all you needed is some screenshots that could be faked and the persons name. And it is only speculation that the persons name was needed since it was a completely different interaction that actually got you the code back.edit let me be clear I dont blame you or think what you did was wrong.

2417369,0,t1_cmacz70,No problem. Somebody else gave me that tip so I dont deserve any kind of regards at all. I was noticing that a lot of surveys were for Hispanic people too. I got disqualified from one by choosing that option though.When they ask you about your job click none of the above. It almost never works if you choose something else.Heres another one. When you notice you are starting to get very specific questions answer positively. For exampleAre you planning to buy a car? Yes.What do you think about X brand? It is an excellent brand.Does someone in your residence suffer from diabetes hypertension heart disease etc? Yes.If they have some kind of slider or tick box with numbers ranging from  to  or something similar try not to give everything a perfect score. Rate stuff differently like a six seven whatever. I do this because they might get suspicious that I am a bot or just rushing through the survey. I take a while to comprehend what is going on and what is the question about because you never know.There are surveys with videos. I dont care about the videos particularly. They will always ask about what the ad was about and will most likely censor any kind of identification. If you truly dont know what the ad was about just take a guess.I was doing a car survey and I dont know anything about vehicles or makemodels so I just answered whatever.If they have a text box where you can voice your thoughts about the product they are offering the same thing applies. I am vague but I try to make an effort anyways.Security questions can be incredibly stupid but they are meant to trick you. I was caught by surprise when I got my first one. They asked me where I wanted to travel to and I ticked almost all of the checkboxes thinking that this was about tourism. I ended up getting disqualified because some alternatives were fake. Be cautious.Security questions are part of the screening process. Survey websites have partners who help with that and this is the reason you may get redirected a bunch of times. Just like OP said these kind of things are there to make sure you are not a bot that you are truly interested and paying attention and obviously to help them find their target audience and save time. Consistency is an issue too. Sometimes they ask you the same question multiple times for example what is your age name etc. If you give conflicting information they can disqualify you.If you use fake info then I suggest you to write these down and memorise everything. I highly recommend using a different email than your main one because there is a high chance of being spammed.,beermoney,cmahulh,2,t5_2s5or

2444847,0,t3_2nbu28,I wanted to start writing political articles.  However I have a rather strange view I fight for the middle ground.  Like for example Id recognize the need for change in Ferguson and advocate for change but I wouldnt blame a racist white system and my call at the end would be to stop the rioting and figure out how to prevent future tragedies.  I want to do this more as a hobby than as a job so Im willing to work for free as I am trying to get into local politics and it would help me in the long run.

So an American cant come to Europe and plead the th because that doesnt qualify with where you physically are disregarding your nationalityAnd you saidgtWell thats because we dont make our citizens abide by all US laws overseas.My whole point was thats NOT why you cant do that. You cant do that because the th doesnt apply anywhere but here no matter how much we may or may not try to apply our laws extraterritorially. You can only apply your laws in your own land. If I want to bang hookers and do a shitton of blow in amsterdam the USu cant stop me. If the US DID apply laws extra territorially wouldnt they still only be able to stop me by punishing me when I returned to US soil? Honest question. Im not positive how punishment for breaking laws would work in those types of situation. Like if a French person breaks a French law in the US. Clearly the US isnt going to punish him. Does Frenchy get away with it until he gets home? Can the French embassy send out some French cops to go arrest him on US soil? I have no idea.

4243658,0,t1_cs3yl0h,as per rules  and  I will address both of themRule  Dont resubmit popular websites without something new and useful to share with the community. Search before you submit to see if someones already posted about it.Its technically not a website. Yes I did submit one hours ago yes there are previous submissions months ago. BUT it states do not resubmit without something NEW. If you compare this post with my original one and with the past posts this one is new. The company has changed their policies during this past few months along with what I had written in my original one had errors because I misread the companies terms of service. This one is more accurate and encompassing. Rule  Dont spam. That includes referral links. If your post is caught in the spam filter and isnt spam message us. Be sure to include a link to the post in your message.Its not spam if I am advertising a new policy change made by the company or if I am correcting misconceptions of a topic that I mistakenly posted earlier. Dont you have anything better to do than to just hound on peoples posts? Youre not even a moderator for his subreddit. Plus if youre gonna nitpick my threads you might as well be good at it and provide supporting evidence of which have not done yet. You have the burden of proof to demonstrate that its either  repost of ORIGINAL material AND  its spam. Otherwise you lose the debate.,beermoney,cs3yufz,0,t5_2s5or

4295436,0,t1_cs9szg7,This is based soley on my previous experience with android  a number of years ago and what I have seen on friends phones.Because google allows android to be put basically on any device this has created a very fragmented ecosystem of hardware out there are dubbed  android the hardware specs and quality from phone to phone can be completely different which in turn will offer a different end user experience. When I had an android phone  I believe an LG? it was considered a mid range device and it was incredibly laggy freezing force close all the time..things like that.The high end phones galaxy note etc..etc.. these days probably offer a very nice experience however something about apple....and I know it is very cliches to say but...it just works. I never have situations were my iPhone behaves in an unexpected manor. Its all very intuitive clean and productive.Apple I think is successful because of the experience. They arent  breaking the mold necessarily but they can bring it to the masses and provide mass adoption not only because of their reach but because of the experience. For example....ApplePay this WILL take the world by storm......is it new? NO! google has has NFC forever....but how many retailers accepted it? thats the difference....its not JUST about what the phone IS but how the phone INTERACTS with the user and the world. How annoying would it be when we get to the stage of using our phones for payment hotel rooms unlock housecar change thermostate turn onoff appliances summon our new autodrive car..........and becuase of your lowew end android device it glitches and you can get in your house? OR your car never comes..etc..etc.. In my eyes apple products wont let that happen very HIGH quality control.Again its a choice High end android DOES have great qualitys and you never know...could surpass Apple in my eyes one day too...thats what I like is that the competition keeps everyone on their toes. Im not a fan boy...the only apple product I own is my phone but for that....for me....it works.,beermoney,cs9tgn7,-2,t5_2s5or

I would still argue that your data is a tangible thing that you are free to sell whether you recognize the downsidespossible risks for eg data that you didnt realize would also be collected or not. The difference with the nsa is of course that not only were they stealing that data the extent of which we dont know but they werent even admitting that they were doing it for a while. The issue of principles is somewhat distracting because the principle of data privacy is related to someone taking the data without your knowledge. However if you willingly sell it that has nothing to do with your principles regarding unauthorized data collection. In my opinion anyway.

4816605,0,t1_cu1djgd,Your problem is that youre mixing up the merchant and the consumer. You are also mixing up sales tax and gtGCs are a lot like coupons they have no cash value. No one can demand  cash from Amazon for a  Amazon card. GCs have no cash value. The value comes from the fair market price of the redemption.gt Perhaps this will prove my point. If a customer does not redeem their gift card the merchandiser can offload the gift card onto a state controller. The customer can still claim the gift card from the state or choose to ignore it. In any case the customer is not taxable for a GC they did not redeem. If the merchant offloads the gift card to a state controller then the MERCHANT is not taxed on the gift card. gtGCs are a lot like coupons they have no cash value. No one can demand  cash from Amazon for a  Amazon card. GCs have no cash value. The value comes from the fair market price of the redemption.GCs are almost exactly like bonds. The only difference is that there is no maturity wait. They both have  values a face value and a street value. If you want you could even go about investing in gift cards buying them for cheap and selling them for a higher price but then you would have to pay capital gains tax on that.  When you BUY a bond it is not taxable income as you have just exchanged one form of financial asset for another financial asset. Likewise when you BUY a gift card there is no tax as you have exchanged one form of financial asset for another. However when you get a gift card for free or as compensation for work then it is income and the IRS wants a share. ,beermoney,cu1o7uq,1,t5_2s5or

5035011,0,t3_3jvk3h,OK I made a more user friendly version of what I use for myself.Choose copy to my drive or whatever then you can edit it. The right side is completely automatic so be very careful with it. Only edit the service name SomeWebsiteSomeApp and AmazonPayPal. Add more to the adjacent cells. Youll see that the formulas are kind of complicated and even the months need to be done the way they are so dont try to manually enter those. Always select and drag if you need to expand it.The left side is completely manual. Just delete everything on the left side and enter it all in yourself. But make sure you follow the template exactly or it wont work.Edit if anyone wants one that starts further back let me know.Edit added daily average for each month. The current month will also be as accurate as it could be because it uses the latest date instead of the number of days in the month.Made a thread ,beermoney,cusws0d,3,t5_2s5or

6125449,0,t3_3zg9o0,Thank you for the notice as well! Had no idea they had just started implementing this policy. After reading the blog post I do find a couple things peculiar gtOne of the most common questions submitted to Customer Support is Did I receive my Monthly Bonus and if so how much was it? Having users claim their Monthly Bonus will clearly show users when their bonus was awarded and how much it was.  gt On or about January  we will alert you that your December Monthly Bonus is available.We will clearly communicate how to claim your Monthly Bonus via Email Inbox Messages Mobile Notification and a prominent message within the Daily Goal meterIt seems that they are going to send us notifications to redeem our goal. If that is the case why didnt they originally just send us an emailnotification that our bonuses had been added to our account? That way we never have to question them and it would be easier for us. I think this is just another way for swagbucks to withhold points from us. Maybe this has already been thoroughly discussed in rswagbucks but just my  cents. ,beermoney,cylwegh,4,t5_2s5or

6339877,0,t3_42dwpq,I started SB in late SeptEarly October and so far my lifetime SB is around . My highest daily SB was about . By far Ive had the best luck on surveys and typically only do a few web searches and misc. offers to close in on a gift card ie  SB and trying to quickly get a  Amazon card. Occasionally a few times a week Id get lucky and hit a few  SB surveys which helps greatly. Initially I was really focused getting my daily goal every day for a few months and earning about  SB daily with some average days as high as . All the goal bonuses add up so it is helpful too. I think my best month so far netted me  in Amazon cards. But I was working frequently with it to help with Christmas money. After the holidays Im much more lax and stopped focusing so much on meeting my goal every day. A month of daily goals is like  extra SB which is nice but lately I miss a few days here and there but still manage high earning days occasionally. So instead of  a month January was a bit less and around  at this point. Oh and since most folks including myself strictly go for the Amazon cards take advantage of the  discounted card you get each month...You can get   Amazon card for  SW which saves you  SB. I typically start saving at the end of the month roll my monthly bonuses into it and grab it at the beginning of the following month.Though lately the surveys just havent been quite as plentiful and disqualifications are getting ridiculous. This might just be a bad month but these last few weeks have been slow.,beermoney,cza9uyq,2,t5_2s5or

If you get any ratings below  stars challenge them and highlight subjective corrections in your review they usually then bump you up a star.ref  nonref,beermoney,czny103,2,t5_2s5or

6733771,0,t3_47twb7,I would not consider a single site here to be moderate or high income when comparing to any normal job. Mturk is probably the closest you can get  but youll struggle to get more than hr so I would still qualify that as low income. Theres a few apps that let you tutor. These pay more but if youre not on in peak hours getting customers can be difficult.The best way to make use of beermoney is to split your hours among numerous sites. Some sites pay more than others but many can be done simultaneously. Ex watching videos and doing PTC while filling out surveys In the end many websites will only net you hr. Perhaps more after you get some experience and know the shortcuts or build up referrals. And likely even less until you get used to the site. Some sites will give more but have rarer offers. rBeermoney is not really the place to look for moderatehigh income.gt You shouldnt expect to make a living but its possible to make extra cash on the side for your habitsneeds.  Side Note Although this isnt beermoney  You mentioned that you go to university. Does it have an art department? Or does another nearby university have one? A lot of art departments hire models.

Every  points   Amazon gift card which is emailed to you in the first  days of the month for the prior month.As far as wasting time I have only used it on signs that Ive come across incidentally and it takes less than  seconds to snap two photos and hit send. That said if youre into contests then that could be actually time consuming. The top submitter for each month gets a  Amazon gift card.My phone doesnt have the best connectability so one nice thing is that if I hit submit and the wifi isnt there or strong enough for it to go through it gets saved in the system until I am connected again.For me its a way to collect an extra couple bucks here and there for doing almost nothing.

7465142,0,t3_4hlanb,. Dont expect to make a lot or make a lot per hour. Youre talking dollars on the hour tops.. If you get frustrated  switch sites or take a break. Dont do it until you hate it.. Start with one website at a time. Give it a few hours and get a feel for it. But then tip !. Dont specialize in one type of work or on one website. Spread out. You never know when a site will run out of work or go out of business.. Redeem as soon as you can. Do NOT wait. Unless theres a significant reason to such as better payouts for higher rewards. This is just unnecessarily risky otherwise.. Save  of your earnings for taxes. If you have taxes I dont really know AU stuff.. Spend some of the money as a gift to yourself. Personally I split mine half for bills half for me. Then that half for me gets split in half for purely wants headphones games etc and the other half to things that need upgradedreplaced cooking tools work shoes etc. It makes it a lot more rewarding and makes you want to earn more that way.. Youre going to have next to no work in comparison early in the year. Plan on it. January and February are awful. Things get about normal in May to June. Holidays usually have lots of work and the end of the year is usually good until late December. This pattern is across the board just expect it.. Dont force yourself to earn x amount of money each day. Set a goal but dont enforce it if youre having a bad day. Unless that works for you... it makes me stop earning for weeksmonths at a time.,beermoney,d2qqo3r,4,t5_2s5or

7544820,0,t3_4io4zv,Probably. Doing that with androids will affect your battery life even if you leave it plugged in. I wouldnt worry about it though its not a major difference. Usually I replace my batteries every year and a half because they get to the point that I dont like the battery life. With leaving a phone charged... I replace it maybe a month or two sooner. So its not a huge change. It doesnt matter what you run its just the fact that its being used. Ive tested this with various android phones.The problem is that charging and uncharging a device will reduce its life span. But leaving it plugged in will cause the battery to slowly overcharge and make the battery not work as well ever heard of battery bloat?.

7731700,0,t1_d3kypq5,Wow so pissy. You really need to chill out. Sorry but I will reply because people like you who think Im right because I said it. Youre wrong because I dont agree. So shut up because Im right. are quite pathetic. I already told you once that you didnt need to reply. That you didnt need to waste more of your so called precious time and now youre demanding that I dont reply? Because you want the last word so that youre right? Amusing. Simply amusing. So I will reply because Im an asshole who will make your phone notify you which will then require you to click that notification to show you a message that you could simply close out of and would have only wasted  seconds of your time. But instead you will read this and then reply wasting so much more of your own time. Or perhaps now you will only read it and not reply since I said you would reply to it. You have to make sure Im wrong right?gt I have to forcefully reply to them because I cant let you believe that you are right because you are not even behind the anonymity of a reddit account.First off I dont actually care whether its reddit or rl. I say the same stuff. However youre also behind the anonymity of a reddit account so Im not sure why youre bring it up. Also you never had to reply. I cant even comprehend why you would think that way. Its my fault that you had to reply? Please. I didnt put your hands on the keyboard. I didnt threaten you to send a reply. I even told you that you didnt have to reply. Dont put the blame on someone else for your own actions its very unsightly.You clearly werent going to change my mind so continuing to reply to me was pointless. Im not quite sure why you thought telling me I was wrong would make me think that I was wrong when my initial post was made in full intention of being helpful. Especially since Ive told many people to search and many people have found that actually helpful. Im not quite sure where you get off thinking your opinion is fact. Theyre separate things honey. People can have differing opinions. And you damn well arent going to convince me that my helpful advice isnt helpful simply because you didnt like it.gt there are no airtime apps listed on the search even though they do exist.There might not be I dont make it a point to follow that kind of thing since its not common. However from what I recall from your post you werent asking for only airtime apps. You quite clearly listed sites that I know dont have airtime. I was offering the suggestion to find even more sites to make money which could then be used to buy the minutes. Simple solution.gtwhy did you even tried to help me in the first place. Because I like to help people I saw your post and I had spare time to type. And also because . I know this sub is full of USUK people and India posts only get a small amount of replies if any.. I knew full well this would be deleted shortly  just like the numerous other ones like it every month.. Most people dont know that there even is a search bar if theyre using the app. People who dont get the help almost always end up posting another post raging about how awful this sub is which wastes more of the mods time to delete it and its just unsightly to see. So Im sorry that I tried to help avoid wasting someone elses time and sullying the subreddit that I enjoy reading?gt But you decided to take the hard route and tried to establish yourself as the smarter one? Thats plain immature behavior from your part.Whats immature is you throwing a hissy fit because I stated the obvious route of action one which many people here dont take. I never once said nor assumed I was smarter. However it appears to me that you have some sort of inferior complex since you somehow assume that Im degrading you when most of my comments were simply stating the reason behind my own actions.Listen I dont get what your problem is but you shouldnt get so pissy. Its just reddit. Its just the internet. No need to get so huffed up over little ole me. If it wasnt helpful to you so be it. All you had to say was I tried searching but I didnt see any that had airtime. I was hoping to find one that gave airtime as a reward. rather than make it look half assed like I would like airtime. Would like  only want. Heck if you even went and asked I probably wouldve gone looking for sites that gave airtime because I have spare time and I like to help. But instead you threw a hissy fit and bitching at me for wasting your time. Youre wasting your own damn time.And just to close this up allow me to quote your post right back at you.gtAlright. You dont need to respond to this. Just read the whole of it if you like and keep your fingers off of that keyboard as long as it is not my comment that you are trying to reply.,beermoney,d3l1fh0,1,t5_2s5or

Honestly if you tried swagbucks prize rebel and INSTAGC then you have pretty much saw all of the available gpt offer walls and survey routers.

That is prolific pays fantastically per survey but doesnt have too many where mturk has a ton of surveys that pay wildly different amounts some good some ok some not so great. Those three also pay quite well but dont have too many surveys the difference between sites like that and sites like prolific is the client of the traditional survey site is mostly forprofit businesses with some professional demographicssurveyers and some political stuff as opposed to mostly or in the case of prolific I would say  academic surveys often from students. There are good and bad things about both but obviously you dont have to pick one you can do all of them. pAnother difference is unlike prolific I would say surveys on those sites generally last a while. Pinecone in particular almost never tells you a survey has reached capacity or screen you out because they pretty much do that beforehand only sending out surveys to the number and type of people they want. Pinecone is awesome. Id do surveys from them all day if I could sadly they only send out a small handful a month.,beermoney,d54bewp,2,t5_2s5or

8818345,0,t1_d77nv2s,I was surprised to see abc paid  for Walmart and even more surprised they pay  for BB too.  I wonder what they offer for other cards. I would not wait for a mail checked myself though.  I would get the ACH Deposit or PayPal.I sold a Walmart gift card on another site like this way over a year ago and the only options they had then was mailing a check and that took about two weeks.  It is nice that they can all do ACH and PayPal now.  I wonder if there I have to pay a PayPal fee??? I would think that abc would pay the PayPal on their end. Is it standard for a business to pay the PayPal fee when they pay money to a customer???,beermoney,d77ufes,1,t5_2s5or

8933750,0,t3_52h605,Theyve either gotten better for me or I just never really got into them right away.When I started college I only came across a money making survey site that was sent to my student email. I didnt even know it was possible to make money online. And booooy does it suck now that I look back on it. Think it was like    minute surveys only paying  or less. You couldnt cash out until  which was like every    months for me. Then I started to look into this stuff more and moved on to other sites that paid a bit better per time. Eventually these annoyed me because they might reject you at any point during the survey.So I moved on again. I keep doing this as sites and apps I currently use either worsen their pay or just dont live up to new sitesapps that pay. With Media Insiders app alone I earn month passively. Rebate and receipt apps sometimes take a long time to accumulate  but its insanely easy to snap a quick picture of your receipt and earn money back on your purchases. Its worth it when I can cash out just for earning money due to shopping. ,beermoney,d7lpdq7,1,t5_2s5or

The companies that provide these offers come here and read everything. If they see that the users dont fit their criteria then they move on OR the website has to change its policy. We all know what happens then. WE LOSE.gt Offers are limited. If you wonder why offers are not available its because they run out. More people running the offers means less offers for you. When you come here and post about offers you are baiting the sharks and essentially taking from your own earnings. It sounds selfish but its true. More people  less to go around.gt The best thing that could happen right now is to treat beermoney app like Fightclub. Dont talk about it.,beermoney,d9am9if,4,t5_2s5or

I had to add money to my paypal  enough to cover my purchase before I was able to enter my ebay giftcard code.If you can buy a prepaid debit card  these are basically checking accounts from what I remember and you should be able to get a verified paypal using one of these.

It happens fairly regularly.  Those articles just happened to be people who were dramatically electrocuted to death or coma.  Obviously anytime somebody is put in a lifethreatening situation over  in parts its stupid.  And they dont all make the headlines. Somebody gets shocked they dont die they dont go to the hospital it doesnt go to the news.  In this thread we have people who have cables smoking or phones freaking out.  The key point is if something is being used correctly.  The point is these are in not correct  I cant imagine any reasonable person thinking thats a good idea. There is clear evidence and proof that they are built shitty.  That means they dont meet basic safety standards let alone proper electrical specifications.  Cell chargers dont have a superhot source of ignition and fuel so when they fail mainly they just shock overheat break  but thats unacceptable. Because standards. Your analogy to the note  is nonsensical. Dozens of fires occur from cell phone chargers every year.  Now talking about phone farming youre multiplying the amount of hours amperage and density  to produce income. Those are the exact sort of people who should be concerned about making sure that basic safety standards are in place. They shouldnt be idiots and put their heads in the sand because its a rare occurrence if you use crap inherently dangerous equipment. Every fucking thing that keeps you safe in the modern world is a code or a law.  Your sewage is safe because its a code that has to be adhered to your electrical system is safer from the NEC etc. Go phone farm in fucking Xxx in a tin shack and drink from same place people crap if you dont care about standards. Anybody who tries to make money from phone farming has a responsibility to only plug in a power adapter that meets basic safety standards not crap. Of course you might think that those engineering codes are bullshit and its perfectly OK to use inherently dangerous crap.,beermoney,dc1d5mk,1,t5_2s5or

10230341,0,t1_dc3dalo,Its one thing to just be uninformed but Im The OP  and you strike me as somebody who wants to be motivated by rational thought. And thats the shame because youre arguing against something I never claimed. I never claimed that you are at great risk of fire or even moderate risk by using crappy out of spec shit for power.I could sleep every night with a L bottle of gasoline at my headboard and probably still die of cancer or a car accident or heart disease suicide etc.I went through great effort to link proof positive that these are measurably poor! huge physical differences huge measurable differences. If it was marked as cereal it would be made out of cereal cardboard and maybe some powdered gypsum. They are fraudulent they dont meet the specs they say they do and they break when you attempt to. The UL labels etc. are also fraudulent. They are illegal to sell in the US Eu. Au JP etc. none of these facts are debatable its all true. Your entire argument that they are probably safe most the time is quite frankly myopic.  The design spec supposed to be safe all the time even in outlier events like electrical motor malfunctions lightning strikes theyre supposed to fail without catching fire without putting line voltage through the device or generally causing the battery to go into thermal runaway. The gasoline in the  L bottle on my nightstand is perfectly safe by your standards.  And thats just ignoring the fact that using bad power is bad for your electronic equipment. Lastly Finding the middle ground is something only non rational people do when there is no middle ground.  You set up a strawman when you say  likely to die in a fire etc.   likely to buying fraudulent equipment thats insanely bad quality no accountability compared to equipment that meets specs like apple Anker blitzwolf Lenovo etc.No matter what Im glad that youre not homeless ,beermoney,dc3o02h,2,t5_2s5or

When I first signed up I had a period of qualifying for only about half of the surveys they sent me but I guess they narrow down your demographic and now I qualify most times. Never had issues cashing out. I usually skip the  surveys but I get  or   surveys each month and usually get a decent  survey once a month. Recently I have been getting some higher value ones too I had a  survey last week took about an hour to complete but worth it and then this week I had a survey that was basically a focus group  test for a new TV show pilot.

Even if it doesnt sit right with you to borrow from her sometimes you just dont have a lot of options. Online stuff can take a few days to pay so even if you could borrow for say a week then you could earn the money online in the meantime.

11321044,0,t1_dfe4y0h,Also go slow on the offers. Some of them are finicky and wont credit if you dont leave the page open for some amount of time. The Life Script offers in particular seem to work a bit better if you leave the page with your email in the submit box just sitting open for  minutes and then you submit and leave the next page open until it credits. It doesnt have to be the top tabpage just has to still be open in your browser somewhere. And for other stuff sometimes it wont credit if you click through too fast.Also offers in your pending folder dont vanish. If they dont credit after  days they go back to being available to attempt again if the offer is still available. Like if you have an offer for Pet Food Email you got from the instaGC wall and it goes to pending doesnt credit after  days if you look at the instaGC wall you should find the Pet Food Email offer there so you can try it again. Surveys are a pretty big crapshoot especially if you arent in a coveted demographic. I mostly dont bother with them because I rarely qualify but I stick to Peanut Labs and instagcs Survey wall because you get points if you dont qualify. Those are also good at actually crediting when you do them.Oh and FYI some of the surveys actually have delayed crediting. Like the sponsor doesnt pay out until a deadline has passed and then everyone gets their  or whatever. One of them I think took two months before people got paid. Thats a rarity but Ive had surveys that didnt credit until a couple days after I took them. Have you tried Crowdflower? Its available on iGC. The beginning is a bit of a slog  pretty much only . tasks but once you do enough you move up to higher levels and get betterpaying stuff. And some of the Crowdflower tasks are really easy in addition to paying okay. And they always credit instantly. I mean Im lazy so I only run videos on iGC but when I was actually bothering to do stuff every day I made a killing on Crowdflower. The best task was this one where all you had to do was select if an image was pornography or not and it almost never was so you get really into the rhythm of doing the task and do like hundreds of it in an hour. ,beermoney,dff7za7,2,t5_2s5or

11619894,0,t3_65the6,I had a friend that signed up about  weeks ago. She was denied originally and about a week later she was accepted.   Dont give up.     You might want to check out clickworker.com UHRS tasks and microworkers.   They arent as good as Mturk but you can make some money with them.      Now lets get serious for a second. Im worried about you even without knowing you. I dont know your situation but I understand what it can be like to feel really and truly desperate. Just a few years ago I was literally days away from homelessness very poor health open diabetic wounds on both feet no money. That was just one of the times in my life I considered suicide.  But im telling you that you can turn things around. But first you need to stop putting yourself down. Stop thinking like you are and start saying fuck you  internally to anyone who doesnt accept you. But the truth is no one is going to truly accept you if you dont accept you. If there are aspects about your life and who you are that you dont like use that energy that you are now using to internalize all that negativity and use it to work on positive changes. Look deep in yourself and be  honest with yourself to figure out whats good and what needs changing.       If you wantneed to talk Im available by PM facebook or skype. ,beermoney,dgd4jeo,42,t5_2s5or
