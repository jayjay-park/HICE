363246,0,t1_cfidv0s,Yeah its totally possible to have a commandline script that automatically does most of that but Hugin results are vastly improved by even just a little bit of interaction and manual intervention. The fully automatic route is better suited for something like Deshaker or vid.stab both of which smooth motion rather than create a fixed virtual camera and do so very well automatically.If you look elsewhere in this thread there IS talk of creating a bot to automatically run Deshaker on gifs which would be great.

This is to prevent shadowbanned peoplebots to detect whether they are shadowbanned. If they upvote or downvote their vote will actually be counted but at the same time an opposite vote will be added to neutralize their vote.

3637164,0,t1_cq6tq2t,They havent completely removed guns. You can still have guns in Australia but it is limited. Same as it is in america.Not every citizen can go buy a full auto weapon in america legally. In fact it super hard for the average american to get a full auto weapon because they are super expensive and the back ground checks are lengthy and they check everything about you. Converting a gun to full auto is a time consuming process as well. You need some parts that would be illegal to purchase such as an auto sear to make the gun work completely. While comparing countries who have completely different cultures is thrown around all the time in arguments for gun control they are like comparing apples to oranges in an apple control debate. Yes its semi worked here but we are way different than Australians. Gun control is such a hard topic to talk about with out getting heated because you are really playing with peoples emotions. While I do agree that there need to be some control I think making them completely illegal would cause an increase in violent crime committed with firearms. Take for example Texas and concealed carry. Before concealed carry was passed the people against it claimed that Texas would turn in to a bloodbath and that there would be a shootout on every corner. There has been no increase in random shootings. The article I linked to below is a great back up. Also there are a lot of defensive gun use and those are hardly ever recorded so its hard to see correct data on it. Source  ,ImageStabilization,cq6v44r,3,t5_2yzy4

Of course there are on reddit and off. But we also have more than enough people defending every unprovoked shooting because theyre sure the officer wouldnt have shot without cause.

11478773,0,t1_dfw2jm9,Thats ok I dont mind being stalked. As long as youre comfortable with my foul language in rhawks then its fine with me!  To answer your question yes its changed a lot. VirtualDub can accept a lot of files and  that includes most of the ones we use for stabilizations and such. Theres a long  but helpful  post here that discusses VirtualDub and the files that it works with and outputs too. If you have it set up right its a breeze to use. Can take a little bit of setting up though but I promise it is worth it. As long as you have the correct input filters and codes both internal and external then things will be fine.,ImageStabilization,dfx45sc,2,t5_2yzy4
