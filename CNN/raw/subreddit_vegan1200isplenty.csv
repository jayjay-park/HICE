10785363,0,t3_5ua0yd,There are plenty of Mujaddara recipes online but this is my moms with some slight edits from me. It makes about  servings maybe closer to ..Ingredients  cup lentils  cup coarse bulgur wheat About  cups water Salt to taste  large yellow onion sliced personally I love onions so I used    cup oil I used avocado oil my mom recommends olive Directions. Rinse the lentils and then put them in a pot and cover with about  inches of water and bring to boil uncovered at first. Skim the top of any foam if it forms then add a little salt cover and simmer until lentils are tender but not cooked through. Drain left over water if there is any. Add  cup of water to lentils and bring to boil. Add bulgur to lentils cover and let simmer for about  minutes or until bulgur is cooked and tender. If the water is all absorbed before the bulgur is fully cooked add more.. Heat oil and saute the sliced onions. If you cook covered on a low heat for a longer time they will caramelize but if you cook it on higher heat they will become crispy  personal preference.. Remove the onions from the oil once they are done.. Pour the remaining cooking oil from the onions on top of the cooked lentils and bulgur.. Stir together and salt to taste.. Serve with onions on top or mixed in.,vegan1200isplenty,ddsfk0c,4,t5_3a1r5
