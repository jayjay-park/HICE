2361521,0,t1_cm3l3zt,Youre taking Marissa to Harrenhal even though shes probably going to murder every man on the spot if the bastard is declared King? How brave of you father.My opinions would be stronger if I knew why our Hand has decided to slap the realm around with a Grand Council when the line of succession is already determined but sadly we dont. Oh but I plan to figure out why even if I have to knock someone around with my cane to do it.Do you o wise father have any ideas?,IronThroneRP,cm3levw,1,t5_345ny
2364039,0,t1_cm3o902,It appears that you have already skimmed the topic he sat lowering himself into the chair opposite the captain grimacing as he did so the streets are far from safe he said matter of factly riots have broken out and looters have been spotted littering the streets taking everything that is not stuck down he sighed but this isnt my real problem my real problem is the loyalty of your men he poured himself another drink and took a long sip not taking his eyes of the Royce with the great council looming over our heads war is all but imminent I would like to discus your views of this Ser Royce Id be quite interested to know themOOC for clarification this meeting takes place in between Luthors meeting with Jasper and his meeting with Andros ,IronThroneRP,cm3wlbd,1,t5_345ny
2369304,0,t1_cm4gbye,Im sorry My Lord I heard nothing. The Queen died hours ago and Ive been too busy guarding the streets of the city. For whatever reason it seems no one has seen fit to send work through the chaos shockingly enough. And the Prince of Summerhall is a bastard. Last I checked bastards couldnt inherit Andros said sarcastically.Still the Commander said his voice softening I suppose with that with this Grand Council that could change. Luthor wont like that much though. Hes too honorable to put the Queens heirs position in danger. Still whether this is the right course or not Im not sure Andros said shrugging.I like to leave the politics of the realm to my Uncle and his most esteemed small council Andros said gesturing to Mattos. If this is a mistake so be it. If this is my uncles decision Ill stand with him. Still Luthor might not. I dont think hed murder men who hes worked closely with for most of his life but a rebellion isnt too far fetched. The old knight trusts me. Ill talk to him and convince him that this council. Are you happy with that Lord Mallister? ,IronThroneRP,cm4jyvi,1,t5_345ny
2401383,0,t1_cm8ihfq,He seems to know what he is doing after all. I knew you were smart but this is genius. Luthor was impressed. Alester shows the brainpower of his father and his fathers father. I know you say the Martells are allies but what if we could strengthen our alliance with both the Martells and the Lannisters? This is it I hope he agrees with me. Luthor sipped some of the Arbor Gold wetting his mouth and clearing his throat. You and your sister are not wed. I say we marry into the Martell and Lannister family. Doing so will not only strengthen our alliances but create a power so strong none can stand against it. The strength of Dorne the men of the Reach and the coin of the Westerlands put together create a deadly combination. Luthor smirked took another sip and leaned back. What do you say Alester?,IronThroneRP,cm8iptc,1,t5_345ny
2409015,0,t1_cm9gaxs, You are right in that assumption Matthos contemplated the boys words for a moment beneath lord Bracken he always knew that he had been a proud man but a council for all lords and ladys of westeros which would house the most powerful people on the continent was beneath him such a nerve but no matter it did not affect Matthos which ever stance the Brackens took.I would advise house bracken to side with the princess too Im sure youve heard the rumours of armys amassing in the reach its only a matter of time before blood shed and youd better hope your on the winning side he looked at Martyn staring the boy right in the eyes just remember lad that sometimes peace will start with destruction sometimes youll find your worst enemy in your closest freind or your most useful ally in the lowest of men he looked back up searching the sky we will always have hope law justice and thats what gets me up in the morning.,IronThroneRP,cm9gomc,1,t5_345ny

2411158,0,t1_cm9pqst,Alysanne caught the Dornish Prince approaching her out of the corner of her eye.  She turned to him and greeted him with a kind smile.  One very similar to her grandmothers.  She continued to smiled as he spoke and kissed her hand.  Your words are very kind.  And your support is very much appreciated she admitted honestly.  I have to admit I do agree.  This council is quite unnecessary.  However it is nice to see the realm gather in one place.  Many faces I have not seen in quite some time she said looking around at all the lords and ladies before turning back to him.  So tell me Prince Olyvar how fares Sunspear?  I do wish to visit some time in the future.  The Princess eyed the Dornish man.  She hoped he was sincere with his support.  While this council felt unnecessary to her it was still called.  Which means she was still going to need the support of the realm to gain what was already rightfully hers.,IronThroneRP,cm9q7un,2,t5_345ny

2416027,0,t1_cma935v,Marissa tilted her head slightly at that statement. Men more want the throne for power to do anything they like Marissa thought coldly. Only a woman would ever truly try to rule it well. Most men are idiots after all. Her smile soon turned into a grin before she found herself nodding in agreement. You are right she said almost too loudly. I think thats the most thoughtful thing Ive heard come out of anyones mouth since I came to Harrenhal in fact.Perhaps the throne should be made more comfortable the. A thousand pillows like the old thrones of Ghiscar. I remember my brother told me once that the thrones of Ghiscar were well and comfortable but as Aegon said no queen nor queen should truly sit content. They say in the Blacks and Greens that Rhaenyra Targaryen was cut many a time when she took Kings Landing.However perhaps some are born into it others arent. Well have to see. I think our Alysanne will make a good queen. I hope that her advisors will be leal and loyal unlike some.,IronThroneRP,cmabw4k,1,t5_345ny

The gears of his mind were turning quickly. Yyou know Tyroshi men. Brutes. He mmight think I was coerced into writing a lletter. And sending me wwould take days and rise suspicion for mmy associates. A finger or an ear could bbbe interpreted as fake as well. And if you sent my head Luthor Tyrell would take yours.Jon looked at the ground and then at the septon.

Marissa asked her and stopped dancing taking her in arm and making break for the table before taking a sip of Vale White before returning to the Karstark woman taking soft hand into soft hand pulling herself up and letting out a long sigh as she got close to the woman. Just dont be like Lyonel please. Kisses are appreciated from anyone and everyone just not when youre foreign and I scarcely know you though one can say I quite know you more than Lyonel.Now lets see. Marissa said scanning the crowd. I dont know where to start Marissa scolded herself for being rather shy at this moment  there had to be some lord that caught both Lady Lannister and Karstarks eyes.,IronThroneRP,cmaghop,1,t5_345ny

Jeyne was not scared at all and as he undid the straps even her breath became ragged at best but her eyes did not show fear. And when the lady emerged from her dress as the gods made her the Lion could not help but stare she allowed him to finish the rest of her dress off exposing her to the world falling from her shoulders and over her breasts in one foul swoop landing on her lap below.And so the lady did make her move then pouncing onto him she said lunging forward and pressing him to the bedding below The lion struggled at the sight of the lady topless. Jeyne looked down at her own breasts  they werent large they werent small either  just simply average.Now my lion this is where you take the charge she smiled softly at him kissing him on his chin all the while looking into his eyes. Their lips melded together next the servant girl letting out a simple gasp as they pushed forward her hands running down to undo his tunic in a haste so quick she actually ended up knotting a few instead of untying them.

As she approached the guards quickly opened the doors allowing her to rush inside all eyes immediately on her.I do apologize she said looking at the Lord Hand as she stopped abruptly.  I was somehow misinformed of the time she said sounding a bit out of breath.  She tried very hard no to sound annoyed and maintain her composure.My apologies she said looking to the lords and ladies present in the room.  She walked towards the empty seat next to her uncle.

As she placed her leg against his chest Alester wrapped his hands around her thigh. He pulled her against him and slammed into her.  Hard and fast  in and out  it was his mantra.  He used it to distract himself and hold of the inevitable.  So far it had worked but he could feel if failing. And then he felt it.  A quake that rolled down Nymerias body and pulled him deeper inside of her.  Nymeria  Alester moaned as his body finally gave in.  He felt the pressure in his loins finally release as he came deep inside of her.  Breathlessly he stared down at Nymeria laid out beneath a slight grin on his face.  ,IronThroneRP,cmluzld,1,t5_345ny

Thanking the Mother Father Smith Crone and Warrior for protecting him and making him so lucky in his life. Most no one nowadays believed in gods and Martyns faith was not so strong as it once was yet it could not help but pray.Lets just hope we both escape this alive brother.

He patted Winter next to him his hands digging into the direwolfs blackened fur.The mountain clansmen have always been loyal to the Starks.  He said carefully.  And in these perilous times they will need support form the rest of the North as well.  He ignored the mention of the man being an exile for now it was something that could wait for a latter discussion he wasnt even completely sure he could trust the man.Tell me why should I trust you?

2870823,0,t1_cnud0lv,Lucas felt the bile rise in his throat. That was a sore spot. He felt his face twist into a grim frown. He took a swig of his seawater to strengthen his faith. The line will not end with a mute. He reminded himself.He began to put the truth into writing. Indeed I have a cousin Asha who is nearly six and ten now. Yet I fear once she is married...the line has naught but me Lord Volmark. I will be sailing tomorrow to raid the Riverlands and visit Casterly Rock yes but my true purpose is it has been for some time now that the Harlaw line will not end with a mute who cannot even wish it goodbye. Be it through salt wives or a rock wife I must find my heir. It was no fault of yours for asking but if you wish to avoid such embarrasment in the future I would invite you to spend some time with my Maester.

2949262,0,t1_co2zm2k,The hint of salt on her lips mingled with the lingering sweetness of red wine on his. Shed never tasted a finer vintage nor any so potent. The strongest spirit couldnt have washed her away so swiftly as this. Sour dregs of guilt sank to the bottom of her mind.Maryen dimly understood how different Lucions kiss felt from the way that men usually kissed her neither the tentative advance of a virgin whom she planned to deflower nor the rough display of dominance from a captain or warrior gloating over adding her name to his tally. She hadnt truly believed Lucions claim that he wanted an equal partnership until this moment. Her lips neither crushed against nor yielded to his as she returned the kiss.Her hands however retained their old habits. The right rose to his cheek her palm scraping across his stubble as it settled at the base of his jaw. Her fingers swept into his silky hair while her thumb delicately traced the edges of his ear. The daggers cuts stung as she touched him but Maryen didnt care. She sought to deepen the kiss the tip of her tongue gliding along the line between his lips. Her left hand too mirrored the placement of his first reaching for his thigh. Barely an instant passed before she slanted forward to clutch his hip insistently.,IronThroneRP,co3cfmc,3,t5_345ny

3051085,0,t1_co93kpv,Several men not corpses this time lined the walls of Castamere. He wondered how different it must have been years ago after Lord Tywin had drowned the place how horrifying. He could picture the creaks and groans of the hanged the silent cries for help as House Reyne and House Tarbeck were exterminated by sword and rope. Lucion wondered if Lord Tywin had laughed as hed done it. Some men liked killing more than others.The shadow of the gatehouse a small little dark smear that ran across the muddy ground passed overhead and he heard the shouts and sighs of relief escaping the lips of his vassals over the sounds of pattering rain. Or maybe that was just the wind? He couldnt tell.Lucion turned around before the gates began to close. Westermen prowled the hillside like lions rather than scurrying around like rats as soldiers were oft to do. They pulled skeletal masses out of fallen twigs and mud beating stakes into the ground and throwing cloths a palette of colors that would cost an artist a fortune over the wooden supports. Then banners rose up claiming pieces of land for one house while another did the same several feet away. It was competitive finding land to lay your tents  especially during the storms when half the earth swallowed the stakes in muddy mush instead of grasping them between their hands.His vassals had left a choice piece of land shadowed by trees overhead to keep the ground dryer than most and void of rock so stakes could sink easier. Lucion grimaced. House Lannister always gets the best of it his father had said. Lions dont writhe in muck. But that wasnt right. Lucion turned to the guard beside him a man in a helmet that covered the whole of his face. That must be uncomfortable unable to flick the water rushing through your visor. Ser... fuck it I dont know your name. Go back there and tell the other men they can take that piece of land right there  he waved vaguely at the place hed seen earlier  and that mine can take someplace different.The guard stared at him. My l King.. are you sure?Am I sure? Hed been much better prepared for this weather ten years ago when hed had a whole leg and the vitality of the young. Mayhaps he should be a selfish bastard. No you arent. But youre not sure about most things.Lucion nodded back at the man. Yes. He shrugged. Wasnt like I was going to sleep very comfortably anyway. A crippled leg prevented that along with those pesky nightmares. Theyd grown more frequent every day.The man didnt reply and Lucions expression contorted into annoyance. Im not my fucking father. You dont have to bend the knee every time I fucking fart he longed to say but his father had been respected even if hated and insulting him didnt seem the best of ideas.Ser? Did you not hear my command? I told you to go!Yes yes yes. the man sputtered then broke his gaze to gallop off into the camp. He felt another splatter of mud on his breeches. No respect. But an even greater part of it tugged at him. No love. Thats what he wanted. His father had ruled by fear he knew and Lucion had considered that the best way to rule by far but now with his family having left him hed rather befriend his lords than be a prideful cunt who thought himself too tall and high to share drinks with them. Youre too weak cripple physically and mentally.When his horse nearly bucked him off after riding through a large puddle of brown Lucion knew the gods agreed.He looked around searching for Lord Steffon Spicers ugly figure. It was only courtesy to await a greeting before walking  hobbling into someones halls but all that awaited him was a weaselly sickly looking man in the colors of House Spicer. What was his name again? Lucion wrung his mind for memories. Artys? Aethan? A fire was lit. Addam. Yes. Addam Spicer. Lucion barely remembered him. At the age of five and ten hed been more concerned with the training yard than those too weak to participate in it. That wasnt the same now for he himself was too weak to participate in it.He descended from his horse letting the mud he landed in coat the bottoms of his breeches in brown rather than black. Those too noble to get themselves dirty are fools hed always thought himself. Lucion attempted to hide the hurt on his face as pain spasmed up his leg. And those too sensitive to handle pain shouldnt have been born in the first place.His cane hissed on the grass as he hobbled towards the man. Lucion did the same as hed done before taking the glove off of his free hand with his teeth then holding it out to him. Lord Addam am I correct? Heir to Castamere? Ugly bastard he is. Although in Lucions experience the pretty ones were more untrustworthy than the ugly. Pretty looks were just as powerful a weapon as swords in some cases.,IronThroneRP,coe8rj8,1,t5_345ny
3062103,0,t3_2v5lyk,After her discussion with her halfbrother Tamyra retired to her quarters in the Tower of the Hand satisfied however nervously that she had accomplished all she could for the moment. She could not rest yet there were still other matters for her to attend. On her desk lay a letter which had arrived some days past. Shed read it already but the alarming pace of the changes at court had kept her too busy to reply and then she had been avoiding her father. Lies she chided herself as she picked up the parchment her thumb rubbing the intaglio of bells in the halved purple seal of House Belmore. We Arryns are honorable and an honorable lady never lies. She knows which truths to speak to whom and when but she speaks them in full to herself at all times Tamyra quoted her grandmothers lesson aloud. The truth was that she didnt want to think of the Valeat least during her waking hours for she dreamt of Viserion night after night.Belmore must believe his sister is safer here. At least you can see a dragon coming. Not so with poison she thought sadly. From what she remembered Alyce was an intelligent girl rather similar to herself in personality and Strongsong had always served her family faithfully. It couldnt hurt to have another keen pair of eyes at court. Besides part of her motivation in appealing to the king had been only her cowardly dread of returning to the Vale. Alyces presence would add to her own arguments in favor of remaining at the Ashen Keep should her father decide to depart.I dont even know what hes planning. Have I ever? Tamyra wondered as she sought out her father at last. Letter in hand she knocked at the door to his chambers.,IronThroneRP,cofdu29,1,t5_345ny
3064609,0,t1_cofm2nv,She didnt know what to make of Lord Leffords pity. The only person to whom she had revealed any measure of her apprehension was Lucion and their conversations had mostly centered on present concerns. Maryen had endeavored to show kindness to Joanna although her last hours at Casterly Rock were spent vainly trying to convince the girl to reconcile with her brother. She carried the letter that she had forced the child to write which she would give to her betrothed if she couldnt coerce Joanna into seeing him off to war when they rode south assuming that the armies didnt set out for the Riverlands directly. As for Lucion she was glad to be rid of her parents cantankerous vile people that they were and didnt know how to console a man who mourned for his. She and her betrothed seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement on how much of their hearts to bare. Thus Leffords comment struck her as strangely and inappropriately familiar. Is he compassionate...or does he seek to exploit weakness?Maryen stalled by taking a generous bite of quail and chewing the tender meat longer than necessary. She brought the wine to her lips but drank less than the duration for which she held the goblet would suggest. At last she put it back on the table and answered Its been no worse than what Id anticipated. Maryen sipped her wine again using the moment to scrutinize his expression. Better in certain cases she added in a neutral tone thinking of Lucion. Her eyes drifted from Lord Leffords face to look for her betrothed but he had already disappeared with Marbrand. Hes in safe hands then Maryen thought protectively  Am I?,IronThroneRP,cofn6re,1,t5_345ny

Look at all these sights we wouldnt normally be able to see in Starfall.Look there is a dwarf shitting in a wagon Oberyn laughed And there is a woman with no hands sucking a mans cock.You know this section of town well then?A man has needs. We cant all be as chaste as the Sword of Morning. I know my morning sword needs a good tight sheath.Arthur just sighed as they walked through the city. No they were wandering. Arthur had been cooped up in the keep for so long he needed to stretch his legs plus get several things. His sister would be cross with him if he did not return from the capitol with some dress or something like that and Beric would have to have something from Queens Landing. A sword maybe a bow? He should also get Yorick something. Not his armor as a knight that would his responsibility but it was not as though his father was a poor man.That was when Arthur noticed the old man sitting the street garbed in rags and a blindfold with a hulking dog looming over him and a brightly colored bird. It was a strange sight even here. Arthur veered toward him with Oberyn in tow.How about I buy you a good meal grandfather?One injustice at a time.,IronThroneRP,cogktgt,2,t5_345ny

This was Lord Tully after all their proud and brave leader who was now breaking down in front of them. He could sense the barely contained rage and anguish in Lord Tullys voice. When Tully finished speaking a grim silence hung over the room.Loren Baelish could think of a million things he could say but he said none. Silently he weighed his options. Few Lords here will have any desire to see their men burned alive by a dragon especially on the verge of war as they were. On the other hand there would always be some braver souls eager for glory or revenge.

The High Septon raised a hand to stop the man as his hand came to rest upon the door. ...If it does not come to me to repair the garment by tomorrow I shall have to burn it. I shall have to be insistent upon the matter as well. It is a shame but one cannot allow an obstinate corruption to be near to the Faithful Folk.He slowly made his way to the table picking up the glass of wine and sipping from it casually. If it does not come I might have to wear blue my entire reign...Which is a shame considering all the emerald garments with golden roses sewn upon them that I so wished to wear as a sign of solidarity with your familys kingdom.He shrugged laughing as he turned fishing out a heavy iron key and opening a door on the opposite side of the room.Good night Ser Luthor! Thank you again for aiding me in picking out my vestments though I am afraid you might have set me on a course to one and only one. But such utterings are nonsense...Enjoy your night!

3176712,0,t1_cor718k,Im going to be sick. Merrin thought to himself as the discussion raged around him. He had forgotten how absolutley cutthroat the Great Game was. Fuck the night this room is full of terrors. Terrors in fine velvet and golden cloth. He sat next to his leige and companion and was so lost in reverie and he barley noticed that everyone in the room was looking at him. Then Dareon sat down and the weight of his words washed over him. That slanderous enough is enough. I refuse to let them damn my belifs any longer. Slowly he got to his feet. A minor lord like himself might be ignored at such a gathering. Trying to sound sincere he turned to adress the collective Reach.My lord Dareon. If I may ask with all due respect have you heard of the Arrowheads? Have any of you been to the Steptones recently? He looked around the room. Then allow me the breifest moment to make my case. I did not escape from Lyseni slavery to hear my company slandered by those who lack the information nessesary to make. such. judgements. He was losing his temper. He could feel it boiling up inside him and chilled his voice to ice. My company follows me absolutley. I dragged my men halfway across the world to come to the Reach to fight for my home. Before we left I gave each man a choice. Come with me to a land unknown to some of them where the pay might not be nearly as good or leave now with a full purse and no hard feelings. Wouldnt you know it but not one chose to leave. What a trip that had been. Me and my luitennants discuss our proposed jobs before doing them. New recruits are given training in as many areas as possible and I do not allow criminals to hide behind my name. My men abide by the laws of the land. And we are some of the best. Infiltration into a secured area is something we have done before. If Lord Alester agrees I can mobilize my men to be ready to move at a moments notice. Thank you.

My guess is they have already drawn their forces from Barrowtown and will stick to the countryside.If I were fighting a losing war in a land already locked in a greater conflict I would fight a Dornishmans war.

It was a terrible sight the broken man. Too terrible to comprehend.So why couldnt he feel any remorse?His eyes drifted towards the Blackhand in the corner as he began walking towards the iron door of the cell whipping his key out in the blink of an eye used to the feel of iron beneath his hands. It entered the lock in the door swiftly twisting and turning in the exact order. Then came the click and finally the creaks.Caliqa strode back towards the fat man. If you thought theyd have you die here with your dignity somewhat still intact then let me tell you how wrong you are.He smirked at the mans weary expression. Hed rather die than live would he? Is that the truth? That smirk widened and agony unseen broke across his face as fast as a storm at the sore moving muscles. Wait the fuck in line he thought tonguing his gums at the uncomfortable thought.The Crowned Carpet and the Whore Who Ran are having a grand time up there ruling the kingdom so much that they are unexpectedly being called fools by those in their own country. He waved his hands up in the air in mock expression. Who the fuck would be uncomfortable at the thought that they smart as they are would release those theyd condemned traitors for no reason at all? He sheathed his dagger with ease barely even watching as the steel slid into the leather. Fucking blasphemous peasants now it seems they must learn the true power of House Targaryen with the head of a frightening man so scary that he can barely even walk. Thatll show the fucks right!? Yes it will my friend he gave the rose a pat on the back. Yes it will and so you must be executed in front of the entire court with your knees bent like a whores and your lips pressed to the Bastard Kings cock.He gave the man a mocking grin already walking back towards the open door.Come along now fat man.

He was sick of this folly this belief that House Baelish was somehow less than the other houses. We come from much more than nothing.He stood up and for once Alayne had to look up at him. His eyes were still locked on hers brown meeting an identical brown. The council fared well more or less for what we had. Lord Bracken tried some foolish revolt or perhaps he just wished to capture the various Lords attention. As expected we are woefully unprepared should the lion bestir himself.He tried to move on but as always it was difficult for Loren to let go of what had been said. The things you say we need to stop dwelling on them. Our enemies will do more than enough of that for us. At the council a Frey emissary felt confident enough to insult our house. A damned Frey!House Baelish is a strong house sister. Our lands are rich are troops many and our incomes as great as the Tullys or near enough to make no difference. Every day we grow stronger and our influence spreads. In three generations we have done more than others have done in a hundred. It is past time other houses acknowledge this. If you do not want to marry this Tully lord dont. But I am finished with our House name holding us back. If we want to win against the old Houses we cannot play their game.

3273295,0,t1_cp1cxzk,Reverence. Alayne had to repeat the word a second time so she might grasp her brothers love for the Targaryens fully.I do not understand why my brother holds such faith in the Targaryens truthfully. Alayne demeanor was authoritative and honest as she spoke of this king. Perhaps if he had been there to see what I did things would be different. She offered a nonchalant shrug almost seeming uninterested as she reached for slices of blood orange taking them into her mouth as easily as she took the wine.The Trial of the Roses was indeed a farce. Leo and Alester Tyrell were both imprisoned on the grounds of treason via both parties. Leo said that Alester committed adultery with Alysanne our faithful Queen Alester denied it. I had a reason to believe Leo  who would escort Lady Targaryen to anywhere other than Queens Landing if they didnt have malicious intent in mind? What if he did fuck her?Alayne shrugged eating between words. Either way Leo is still in prison Alester has expressed no interest in meddling in the affairs of the Throne and you my dear friend and lord are the first to hear about this in Riverrun. I received a letter from one of my loyal confidants earlier today who told me that Alester expressed no interest in dealing with Valarr. Without the support of the reach the Targaryen dynasty is doomed. It also told me that he perhaps is considering independence amongst other things.Alayne rolled her eyes.Lannister Tyrell and Martell if they decide to go that way gods be good  the seven kingdoms are split. The North is facing a civil war and were in the middle of it surrounded by enemies. Alayne did not stop talking despite Brandons ques. Your next moves will decide the Riverlands fate. The game is not easily played but thats why Im here to help you learn if youd like that of course. War is no trivial matter.,IronThroneRP,cp1dsbj,2,t5_345ny

HAVE ONE THOUGHT THAT ISINT YOU PISSING YOURSELF. At least thats what Torric wanted to do. Instead he did what he always had he let Lucions words trail off let him catch his breath while Torric thought. Some people found it unnerving even rude that Torric would wait so long to speak. Torric always believed in thinking before speaking no longer how long that took.The silence grew suffocating all in the tent with its weight. His lords sat stunned at the mad Lannister and Torric didnt blame them. Maybe Lucion had finally fallen down once to many times.  It was getting tiring to be the only one not going batshit insane every time bad news arrived to them. Lucion seemed to have no way at coping allowing every problem to be the one that would end them. His emotional state was questionable and the longer Torric spent with him the more he worried that one of Lucions vassals decided enough was enough and put a knife through his throat. Hopefully hes as good with the cane as he used to be with a sword.I am tired of you making choices of where I will go without me knowledge or consent King Lucion. If you do not want to me to go to King Alester on my own then fine let me help you come slay the dragon. Whatever it is I will not sit here at Castemere. We will either march together to the Riverlands or I will go to see Alester Tyrell on my own and we can lay down plans until you arrive. I promise not to harken back to my barbaric roots and rip off Alesters cock and rape his wife.  Torric had not let his voice rise one bit his voice was calm almost bored sounding in contrast to Lucions mad ranting. Torric was the rock that Lucions waves of emotion broke upon. As for this high septon I will take care of him myself when we reach Queens Landing. That brought a roar from his Lords. Torric hoped he came of as joking to Lucion though he couldt ignore that small part of himself that wanted to drown the High Septon in his own urine.What beautiful symbolism.If Alester believed Martyn he wouldnt even be talking to you. Also I would like to point out he is calling himself King it shouldnt be hard to win him to our side. Our plan is almost coming to fruition. Do not worry about the small folk they will bow to over holds the sword Gods seem to disappear once a blade is your neck. ,IronThroneRP,cp964ua,1,t5_345ny

It was peace and he was glad she was there. She was a link to times less tumultuous less uncertain. He gave a soft laugh at her questions and rubbed his hand slowly over his bald head.What happened? I used my family in the war against the throne and I ended up ruining it. Harren believes me to have betrayed him in some way Ive married you off to a Lannister and Rurik is dead. Only Dartmut remains. I have sacrificed my family for my people and Im still not sure if its worth it. He spoke plainly and truthfully letting the emotion of his words show on his face but not in his tone. He and Maryen had gone through too much together to hide anything at all. What do we do? We win we free ourselves so I can say it was worth it even if I am lying to myself. A stronger wave leaped forward passing past Torric and Maryen engulfing them up to their waists. He sighed as the cool saltwater soaked him anew and receded back from whence it came. How can you help? By continuing what you are doing. Lucion is dedicated to you I dont know what you have said or what youve done but he truly cares about you. He listens to you. Torric turned his head and met her eyes studying the curves of her face the way her hair clung to her head from the fury of the wind and the mix of saltwater and sand. She looked so much older with so many more burdens to carry.You will need to bear him a child so that this alliance is truly sealed. At least thats assuming his cock works.

Be sure to maintain breaks between your words as you would in any other message else it will be more difficult for me to read. Another strip of paper tugged free and unfurled handed over to the Lord Frey along with the stylus. Go ahead and try your hand at it she said. I promise not to watch your first attempt. Not that she could have had she wanted to but it seemed that the Lady Tully was not entirely devoid of humor. There is however the matter of exchange. We should not I think be seen togetherhad I sense enough I should have taken more care when I first sought you out. But that is neither here nor there as it cannot be remedied now. That said it is only natural that two people residing in the same space should chance upon one another. Natural too that someone in the service of the Lord Tully would politely greet his sister under such circumstances. Yes and then it came to her. I have always been fond of an afternoon walk which takes me through the courtyard just after the midday meal. She was reaching for more paper palming the rolled blank within her right hand. Your...greeting tonight was unsettling only because it was unexpected. But should I expect the same should we meet... And here she was holding her hand out to him as any good lady might.

It was good to know that the King was surrounded by trustworthy men and Casper was happy to know he would be leading the attack on the Kings Gate. That left Casper with the five thousand men to storm the Lions Gate should the need arise. Adorned in the gleaming white armor the white cloak flowed from his shoulders Casper was barking orders and making sure everyone was well armed for the coming attack. However people felt about the faith know matter what proof they offered Casper did not believe. If there were Gods why would they have cursed him so? The High Septon stood for everything that Casper hated. The only person Casper could trust was himself he was the only person who had ever looked out for himself and he did not think the Gods were going to start frowning or looking down upon him now. If there were Gods they had abandoned him long ago. Pay attention to what youre doing! Casper shouted at a young squire who had knocked over a rack of weapons.

Ironborn really like longships Im pretty sure this could wash over them easily. Not that I think they would come here in longships... it would be a very long ride from the Iron Isles to Queens Landing. She didnt wish to scare him with what she said next but figured itd be a good idea to warn him. The ship would be built with mainly oak but Ironwood would be needed well not needed but wood be a nice addition. It wouldnt be constructed fully out of Ironwood seeing as that would make it all the more expensive but coated with it. A nice defense... and seeing as his grace intends to ride North to meet with the Stark... I think we could get a good deal.

Battle had continued to erupt all around them but Alyns shieldwall had worked better than he could dream the mix of iron and ironwood proving an impenetrable defense against their foes. The Ironborn smashed against it time and time again but could not break it and now they were tired out while behind the wall the northmen he had gathered were rested and eager to rejoin the fray. Helman held the Glover standard and other men the Direwolf of Winterfell itself both flapping high in the winds of war. The Northmens defense had been an invincible anvil to the Stark cavalrys hammer but commanding a defense was not the way Alyn would win this battle. There was no glory in cowering behind the shields. No. When the wolf charges again his hammer will meet a hammer of my own. If any man meets that bastard Torric hes mine! The men roared in approval of his courage for few men with one arm would bet their lives against the fearsome Iron King. Lets show them what us Northmen are made of! Shields OPEN!

Staring blankly to the ceiling Criston experimentally flexed his fingers wrapped them around a dead mouse and tossed it into the air. Leto expertly swoop down as much as one could in the cramped space and caught the rodent in its golden beak landing on its bird stand.

Despite the time of day crowd had formed at the sight of such a large company of ships from Volantis each wanting to see these visitors first hand and in most cases sample their goods as well.The crowd parted to let the man and his company through but one did not need the crowd to part to show him. He stood almost a foot above everyone that surrounded him. His make was clear High Valyrian his own purple eyes piercing and bright. His face was fair in features and as the moonlight cascaded from above it shimmered off of his silver hair.I Jachaerys Brightscale King of the Stepstones and the Waters recieve this fleet on behalf of the Triarchs Holders of the Sun the Moon and the Stars.Jachaerys face was stern and his thoughts calculating. His patrol ships had seen the Volantene vessels long before they had reached Dragons Den. The small patrols had been quick in their return to the city to rouse Jachaerys and his entourage as they had been ordered. An untrained eye might think this was a war party but Jachaerys had traveled the world as a sellsail and he knew how much more threatening a war party from Volantis would be.Jachaerys himself was surrounded by a good twenty of his citys Dragon Guard along with several of his new lords. Former captains and loyal men who had been granted titles surrounded him dressed in the finery of whatever lands they were native to. Among the assorted group were men from Westeros Tyrosh the Basilisk Isles and even a few Volantene lords. Jachaerys brindleman prisoner was among the group dressed in his native finery with his hands still tied behind his back.Jachaerys himself was clad in a strong steel armor with large ornamental structures on it. Carved into the black steel were designs of dragons and their riders dancing across his fore and back. Chasing one another in an endless cycle. The ships had landed at Daeron Harbor one of the better developed harbors across the city. A host of other ships were docked in the harbor besides the Volantene. For Jachaerys had called for a gathering of men at his capital. Above the harbor rose the road of Blood Run that ran straight between the rows of growing businesses and residential districts where merchants and refugees had made their homes all the way to Jachaerys walled fortress The Bastards Citadel. It stood imposing on the landscape built in the image of the fortress now abandoned on Dragonstone by master builders and masons from Braavos. The entrance gates where marked by stone dragons on each side of them.Jachaerys looked at the slave of Rhllor standing on the ship calling to him. The man bore a clear sign of a member of the Temple of Rhllors Fiery Hand. Not only the tattoo but the strangely colored armor meant to make the man himself look as if he were on fire.

Now with a son that feeling was increased tenfold.Hows Robert? He asked Alesander as he reached behind him and snapped his fingers to a man waiting beyond the open doors of the keep.

This is for him.Steffon placed the object  wrapped in fine black velvet trimmed with gold  in both hands and unraveled the fabric to reveal what was inside. A sword of exquisite beauty forged by the smithy at Storms End. The hilt and crossguard was an intertwining work of black and gold and the pommel was an intricate carving of a stags head though the horns were kept short to prevent any damage.A gift from the Lord of Storms End to the future king may he never use it on one of us.

4881915,0,t3_3hmj2c,As soon as the first pirates most of whom were closer to green frightened boys then to warriors and raiders had fallen to his longaxe he was sure of what he  had already suspected. This would be no battle merely slaughter. Before Rodrik even had set foot upon this joke of an isle the first of the Essosi already started to veer back in the direction of their small cottages while some made way to ships floating close to the shore. After driving his longaxe into the skull of a Myrish boy who never even raised his sword more like then not terrified by Rodriks Greyscale ridden visage he yelled out an command to his MasteratArms Harren.You see those ships further down the shore? Take a dozen men and strip them of all goods that could be worthwhile. And make sure you get there before the others I dont want my loot stolen from me!As you command Lord Captain! Harren said with glee in his voice and then turning to the men who followed him of the Drowned Fury. Have you heard you pox faced bastards? We have a ship to take!The men let out a roar and followed quickly behind him. Rodrik himself lead the rest of his men closer to the sheds standing further off the shores. A few of the pirates tried to resist one of them a Tyroshi tower of muscle who was most like the smith of the settlement even managed to get past his defenses and give him a gash along his cheek. Rodrik never even flinched as the fool had cut along his diseased side which gave him time enough to give the Tyroshi an axe to the forehead.While his men with next to no losses stormed the village he took some time to look what the other Ironborn were doing. Quenton Greyjoys Krakkens Wrath was the first to touch the shore and he had broken the weak pirates just as Rodrik had now standing if his eyes could be trusted with his sons. His resolve before the Southerners and wolves may be weak but he is still a true Ironborn at sea. Further along the shore was the Greenlanders Belly which had also landed. Its men were coming close to the absurd sheds with some already entering the village. When he recognized one of them as his nuncle he felt shock creeping up inside his head replacing the lust for battle which had resided there thus far. What is the old fool doing? Lark Merlyn may be an able captain but he was no longer fit for fighting much less for a raid. As old and foolish he may be his nuncle was the only remnant of his youth and he cared more for him more then he would admit.With that in mind he made his way towards the place where the old man had entered the mess of a settlement. Even though the fight was all but done some of the pirates still tried to defend what was left. The air was filled with screams from women and men alike but nearly all of them where in foreign tongues which made him proud to be Ironborn. When he turned around the corner of a building he saw a young Lysene scramble out of one of the houses with a wench clutching his arm Rodrik had better to do then fight those who fled with the ships surely already taken bis his men they would not come far but the Lysene was fool enough to  raise his blade and block Rodriks path. He screamed something and jabbed his sword in the Captains direction. Rodrik caught it half way spun it around with immense force and took of his arm with a swing of his longaxe. The Lysene fell to the ground screaming once again first only jibberish then something Rodrik understood. He was begging for mercy. Pathetic. Rodrik gave him the mercy of a quick death and cold steel. The woman was long gone by then.Minutes later he found his uncle being carried along by two of his men. Thank The Drowned One he is alive. Now taking a closer look Rodrik noticed that Larks leg was bloody and a small cut in his chest was to be found aswell. He spoke up with a severe and angry tone of voice.You bloody old fool I commanded you to stay on the ship! Are you already too deaf to hear my commands or too befuddled to understand them? Larks answer was just as expected gruff.They say a captain is a king on his own ship so you  can stick your commands up your arse boy while we are out at sea! If you truly think I will die against a bunch of pirate scum you are the one who is befuddled.He dismissed the old man with a brusque wave of his hand and his men dragged him along. He had no time to deal with his insults now and even if he had he might aswell talk to a a dead man.He also had something more important to do then just cutting up pirates and plundering. Finding Skadi Harlaw. There was still something to be discussed before they arrived in the capital of the Greenlanders. The Lions will pay the price and this time not even all the gold of The Rock will be enough. Only iron.That thought made him smile.,IronThroneRP,cu9wixa,1,t5_345ny

It was too painful to have to choose between his emotions and his duty.  Was it even his duty?  Roland had given so much already he wasnt sure he had to give up anything more and there was some things he certainty didnt want to let go of.  There is a simple way to fix all of this Roland remembered.  It would be a slight to the King and the Small Council  not to mention the countless other amount of Lords with matches they intend for him.  The only thing that was stopping him was his fathers voice and his house words.  Honor before Honors.  The problem was that his father was telling him something completely different and he feared that this would lead him to abandoning the enigma between the Westerling Words.When he turned to face Alesander he gave him the slightest look of distrust and shook his head.  It hurt him to act this way and he felt shame because of it.  He wanted things to be easy simple and the decisions not so tearing.  For the time being he would hide his feelings it was the only way  he didnt want to hurt his friends.God damn it Alesander I dont want to talk about this right now not at all.  He tried to look calm but the agitation in his eyes and frustration in his voice had betrayed him.  And besides I dont want to sour our company just yet for we have many hours of riding ahead of us.

5012915,0,t1_cupotk7,Watching Everan play with Owen filled Leonetta with a warm sense of belonging.  She looked at them both as a father and son Jyanna and her were sisters and this was a uniting of families.  It seemed so simplereally.  Roslin fit in somewhere.  Perhaps another sister whom she wasonly just meeting but then Leonetta felt something hidden about thewoman. And what do you want Roslin?  Leonettas eyes went to Owen who seemedfasinated by Everans finger.  The child held onto it as he peered aroundlooking back at his mother.  Leonetta imagined the young lad as a boy whohad just found a stray. Can we keep him?  Little Owens eyes seemed to ask.Your son gives too much away.  Her eyes searched the woman.  What a gorgeouscreature she was.  Milky white skin beautiful flowing red hair and green eyes just like Everans.  Leonettas eyes flashed dangerously upon Roslinfor a moment but Leonetta did not know why and thankfully Roslin didwas too preoccupied with her son to notice.Hm? Lenoetta said looking at Jyanna as she caught her expectant glance.This question.  Leonetta studied Jyannas face for a moment before shedecided to be coy as usual.  She leaned over to whisper into her cousinsear. I was thinking I might try my hand at pinning down a wolf.  She gaveJyannas hands a little squeeze.  Then again Im not sure if I could standthe cold.

5021519,0,t1_cuqyx09,Alyssa nodded several times as Roslin made her ignorance known swallowing hard before speaking.Lady Jeyne sat with us upon the dais during the joust  at the behest of her cousin the Hand  but after Gareth was unhorsed he arrived as well hoping to observe the rest of the competition from our box. He sat upon the steps but managed to draw the ire of young Princess Lyarra who after a few pointed questions successed in winning from him the reason he was banned from the joust at all. Apparently the Tyrell boy had kissed Jeyne at a feast some days prior which of course upset her cousin. They seem to be on fairly amiable terms now however she was the one who vouched for him to remain.Roslin went on to speak of the merits of her cousin doing her best to place him in a positive light. Edderion listened intently  he had of course given the boy permission to court Lyarra only a little earlier that day. But he could only shake his head as she attempted to excuse him and smile as she called the Kings own past into question.Youre right he said when she was finished. I was quite a fool when I was young  which is why I am so cautious about your cousin no matter your shining opinion of him. The mistakes we make as children affect us even into manhood its the same lesson I told Lady Jeyne when she too excused the Tyrell boy. You both seem...charmed by him and Im sure he can indeed be quite charming. But it is not charm I seek when I search for my sister husband. And theres more to marrying a princess than simply having the prestige and power to win such a match. To send Lyarra so far south would be dangerous I think and I have no plans to put her in danger. But even with all that said  I did give the boy permission to call upon her should he wish under heavy supervision. So who knows. If hes as charming as you think perhaps Ill be in Highgarden sooner than we imagined.The Queen in the North glanced up at him sharply. I had no knowledge of this. She said her voice polite but full of tension. Her husband looked at her locking eyes in manner that brooked no argument.It was a private decision between myself and my brother. I did not think to disturb you in your quarters.Though it was spoken with nothing but a soft voice full of understanding the Queen well received the barb hidden in her husbands honeyed words. Obviously the king was not happy with her new habit of spending her evenings in Argelle Starks rooms rather than their own. They looked at each other for a only a moment an entire argument passing between them in the space of a heartbeat before looking back at their plates.Alyssas head rose as Roslin spoke again and the sharp look in her eye softened to one of pity and sympathy. She reached out to take one of the Redwynes hands in her own rubbing it softly with a thumb.Yes Edderion told me. Im so sorry to hear that dear. Must have been terrible to go through. She glanced at Edderion and for a moment her words seemed truly genuine. I could not imagine losing my husband.The moment past the breath lost into the mists of time. Alyssa released Roslins hand settling back into her own chair.Im happy to hear however that some youth has caught your attention. You seem like a wonderful woman Roslin Redwyne. Im sure youll have no trouble winning the lad over. Her eyes lit up. Surely at the feast some attempt will be made?

Thyron said all of this completely deadpan. After a beat he started laughing. As he was sure Quenton was confused about why he was laughing after being insulted he started to explain. The thing is Lord Greyjoy I find the kind of honesty that Lady Harlaw showed refreshing Too often Southron Lords will not say what is on their mind hiding behind false courtesy and flattery. Or they will try to be flowery and insult you in order to build themselves up. When Lady Harlaw spoke she was not speaking to an audience nor was she attempting to curry favor with another she merely saw me as a younglooking southron lord with a sword.Frankly I found the whole thing a bit funny. I can take a jest about myself quite well and of course she backed up her talk quite well.

What was the relationship of Hellholt to the rest of Dorne who was this Quentyn married to did Everan approve of the Dornish?  Did that matter?She gave a halfcocked smile to the Lord Uller who seemed to share a lot with her.  I too find myself wandering about on my own though sadly I rarely cross into Dorne.  Ah and clothes besides you wont find many women like me in Dorne or outside of it Ill wager.The day seemed to grow dry as talk of Dorne passed their lips as though sands from the faroff kingdom came to settle in Kings Landing and sift away the cobblestone roads.  A daughter?  And you fear that she is in danger?  Leonetta studied his face looking to see which words brought lines to his brow.

He knew he wouldnt be needed this evening but he had been allowed leave to attend anyway and could keep just as good an eye on Rhae and Dae from as far away as possible should the need arise. This was a day to forget about duty though it didnt seem like it would be any less tiresome.His tawny eyes lazily scanned the room for someone who looked different to the usual stuffy nobles wittering on in various crowds who may actually provide some interesting conversation. Lord Bolton had been cordial enough the other day and a decent man though he would likely be expected to field his share of chatter from vassals and Sers.His eyes fell upon another figure sitting apart from anyone else who seemed to be lost in the same search as him watching the movements of minor lords and Knights intently. She had a hardened and strong look about her her frown making it hard to tell if her expression was one of bitterness or concentration. Her dress almost the perfect mix between a dress and a warriors garb was certainly intriguing.Ironborn perhaps? He thought to himself noting the silver waves on her and the images of vast ships on her shoulders. He walked over with a sly smile to strike up a conversation. At the very least it should break the tedium.Enjoying the feast my lady? He said a little hint of sarcasm as his eyes flicked to her plate barely touched.

The Volmark did not have an agenda really but he thought that though he was but a lowly lord he had to meet the king somehow. He had no real idea of why he felt the need to greet the king. Perhaps it was because of the fact that he had never really met or seen a person with this much power. The position was fascinating to him and yet he had spent a lot of time sitting at his table pricking at his food with eyes fixed at the higher platform making sure that he knew which of the people there was actually the person that he so wanted to meet.Ulwyck grabbed a cup off a nearby table and took a swig of it. Perhaps to gain the necessary confidence he quickly reflected though immediately regretting it. Some arbor piss he supposed and made himself swallow it instead of making a scene by spitting it out over the nearby guests. He looked back towards his king took a deep breath and started to approach while trying to catch the eyes of his liege.As he reached the bottom of the dais he realized that he had no idea of what courtesies should be applied in the situation.

There was a stigma that the Lions were treacherous incestuous tyrants and hardly anyone wanted to be associated with that.

Sometimes he felt as though the Rock stood alone in the realm a grand reminder of how far the golden lions had fallen.I hope at the least the trade will become healthier.

The other positions were interesting but he felt that they would just fall into other councillers duties such as the Master of Coin and War  despite the latter being more of an honorary title than a position of any real importance.All very interesting proposals.  Roland said politely.  And as you said depending on the outcome of the trial we may have a few changes in members.  Roland watched the man carefully did he wish for such a position himself?  If there was need for a new Master of Whispers perhaps he would be a good choice but this time Roland wanted to make sure the man was loyal.How can you help?

It was crowded it stank and the men there fought and squabbled like rabid dogs. He had gotten some good stories to tell back in the Crannogs though. It would take him most of the journey back to adapt them true but they were good nonetheless. Yet this Southron bastard was an interesting catch. A tailor it seemed and a lonely one at that scraping out a life in some Southron city or another. If Howland proposed the plan he had thought up in the last few seconds now it might work.

A long scroll of parchment and a quill was placed in front of him and a Gold Cloak took his place next to him to read his words.The next witness is one of Leyton Hightowers own personal guard who came forward after the incident surrounding Gerolds murder.  He is mute but he shall transcribe his tale of events for us.  It is worth noting he has not heard Nathans testimony.  Roland gave a further nod.  Please tell us what happened.A heavy hand quickly began to write this was an essential testimony and one which would lead to the downfall of Leyton Hightower.  The room was silent while the man wrote and when he had finished he offered up the parchment to the Gold Cloak next to him.The man cleared his throat and began to recite.  Lord Leyton Hightower arrived that night with two other guards and the boy who was later found dead in Gerold Hightowers tent.  The guard knew exactly what was going to happen and Lord Leyton entered the tent for several minutes only to call upon the guards to bring the boy into the tent.  When they entered Gerold was already dead and the boys throat was slit shortly after and a note placed upon his person.  Lord Leyton threatened them not to tell anyone and he chose his guards very well and even cuts off their tongues leaving them mute.

She could so clearly the hand resting lightly on her hip and that new and exciting ache for his touch came back. But her excuses of before began to slip away with the wine and all she could think of was the hand on her hip.She stood up to kiss him his words swirling in his mind. Intoxicating. Her hand went to his closing around it softly. Beautiful. She pushed it down and onto the silky skin of her leg through the slit of her dress. She let out a gasp as the contact was made her heart racing. Alluring. She said nothing more but pushed his hand up her leg to where the lace of her smallclothes circled her burning thigh. Her inhibitions slipped away as she felt his hand her heart thumping at her chest. ,IronThroneRP,cwchwag,2,t5_345ny

The hopeful informant wouldnt act suspiciously though. If unwanted eyes found themselves looking upon him he would tell them the truth. That he had some minor business to speak to Hoster about. His raven black hair hung loosely underneath his cloak blending with the darkness that invaded when the sun departed. The tail of his plain cloak followed behind him as he briskly walked through the trees.Upon exiting the wood he came upon a man scarred with his eye covered. His tangled crimson hair was even dirtier than Hosters own dark mop. The red and grey armor the man donned reminded him of the weirwood and he immediately recognized that that was their purpose. The man in front of him was Alyn Glover. They had crossed paths in the Godswood before the fact that he didnt immediately recognize him was a testament to the stress that had plagued Hoster over the last few days. He must have been waiting for Hoster to leave the wood so he could go in to pray.Greetings Alyn. Hoster returned Glovers friendly greeting with a smile of his own. Nothing of report tonight just needed some time away from my brothers lordly business to pray and collect my thoughts. Im sorry to keep you waiting for your turn.,IronThroneRP,cwd1jh0,1,t5_345ny

He was a friend to me Im sure you know.Bid free to sit Harlen sat. He took a seat opposite the Lady of Dragonstone her chairs bare of any sort of cushion. Perhaps it was a statement a metaphor. That Cassana Baratheon surrounded herself with things as tough as she was from uncomfortable wooden chairs to a minimalist approach towards chamber decoration.Or perhaps he was just reading too much into things.Straight to the point. Harlen chuckled. A point in your favour Lady Cassana. There comes a point where the throwing around of words becomes too much to handle. That said you do not need to request my support.

5577435,0,t1_cwoc97p,Bloody Ironborn...Benjen frowned worried by the news and what it implied. Allowing the Ironborn free usage of the Trident would leave Stone Hedge alongside most other major Riverlands castles open for the  Ironborn to raid. The Riverlands could and probably would burn like in the days of old as the reavers descended on the smallfolk and the weaker lords. Pirates and Ironborn the same men just dissimilar names.Conflict on several fronts from several foes that wont end well not for us. Oldstones belongs to our people anyway so I cant see how lord Ironmaker thinks the king will allow him to stay there for more then a few nights. Youre about the Trident too Tris. Giving the Ironborn free use of our rivers is akin to opening our doors to bandits and asking them to not rob us blind. Id say well have to fortify the mouth of the Trident anyway at least for a while and if it deters raiders and stops potential invasions then it will be worth it.He pondered wondering on the coming days. Lord Grayjoy wont attack hes no fool. Im more worried about second or third sons and ambitious captains eager to gain glory and riches or more powerful lords disguised as nobodies.Shrugging he grinned. Perhaps it wont come to blows perhaps we will resolve this diplomatically but Id doubt it unless we enlist Redsword for a time.Chuckling Benjen began to drink. The south will probably only need a few forts and the like Harrenhall and Stone Hedge are close enough so we could reinforce them quickly if need be. A fortified Trident would help us there too if something does happen.He turned to his friend who looked himself deep in thought. Brynden?

6121966,0,t1_cylf19x,Delphines watchful eye kept catching sights of Syraphos exchanging pleasantries with Koyoren and then stalking over to Dephera again the hunter on the prowl as the Magister spun her about at a leisurely pace on the dancefloor. A pondrous look crossed her face as she saw Syraphos preen and primp himself in front of Adelie Aldroch a pretty enough girl if a little plain looking.Making Dephera jealous? How quaint she thought faintly putting on a sweet smile for the Magister. She was not yet sure what to do with the Fisher Prince. To go against him would be to admit that he got to her and that was not something she was happy to announce. But to accept his offer would be suicide. Her to promise that she would not raise hand against him when he wouldnt do the same? No that wouldnt do. And keeping the future in mind Delphine was not ready to give two siblings to attain one goal as empty as the title of the Harvest Prince. Perhaps if it were a Magistrate then but even so it would be questionable.His interest in Dephera also struck her as dishonest as it could be. He was nothing more than an opportunist which was sweet in a way. To find a fox on an island full of eggs would make another predator worry especially if the fox happened to be stronger and faster for now.But what was in it for Syraphos other than personal amusement that she and Dephera apparently provided him with? Well in a place like Lorath juicy drama was hard to come by. That could be it. It was a shame that the man was making himself an adversary where Delphine had gone searching for a potential ally but when life gave you lemons... you shipped them back to Dorne? Magister Bemelie Delphine began turning her attention to the man whose frail hand still felt surprisingy solid on her waist. May a woman inquire what does a Magister think of a new Fisher Prince? Does a Magister find him an honorable man?Curiosity for a suitor Miss Demion? he asked his salt and pepper brow arching.A Magister should know that a Demion woman does not seek marriage so easily she chuckled.Ah yes the little rebel. A woman gave a father plenty of heartache the man said solemnly making Delphines lips twitch slightly at the mention of the former Harvest Prince. But a woman also gave a father plenty to be glad for. A Magister has heard a woman has ambition as great as a fathers. A woman will find that a Fisher Prince might have such as well or at least the teeth to cling to that which a Fisher Prince desires.So would that be a yes or a no to the question then? she queried grinning playfully as she recognized a spark of amusement in the mans eyes.Depends on a womans definition of honor a Magister believes.That would have to do. Depheras heart soared and then sunk again as Syraphos appeared at her side promising to whisk her off on a dance and then taking interest in Adelie instead. Rationally it sould not have come as a surprise as she herself had watched him walk around with Delphine earlier a hand on her back intimately before doing much the same to her. A player a cad maybe as Delphine seemed to look at him? But tankfully a rational mind was something that had no place at a ball and so Dephera swallowed it down smiling softly in anticipation of her dance.Adelie Aldroch daughter of Masseron Aldroch. A Fisher Prince must surely know the Aldrochs great seamen as well.A woman is glad to meet a mans acquaintance Adelie responded meeting him in a cool embrace.

6278059,0,t1_cz37r42,Delphine let her fingers trail through her long slightly wavy hair as she listened and nodded the motions almost dreamy. The visage of the beautiful ephemeral Delphine Demion was rarely allowed into the eye of the public kept safe and sound behind the walls of her manse. It was Malirin who combed her hair each evening and morning and then set it up in strict sometimes almost matronly styles. She wore high collars and dresses that accentuated her only very little certainly not as much as the flame and teal she was wearing now.There were simple reasons for this. A woman too pretty for her own good would do well in court but badly in trade. She was nothing without the respect of the people mostly men that she worked with. In that sense being the fair daughter of a beautiful mother was a hindrance as much as a boon. Pretty green eyes were a lot easier to turn away if there wasnt a deathly snarl behind them which Delphine had slowly nurtured in herself over the years.Her nose quirked slightly and she glanced down as Zia mentioned trust and how they could both be even too guarded. She was correct of course. But how much was too much? When did the border between reasoned carefulness and blatant mistrust run? Especially for one who had been burned before!I do she agreed softly flicking her eyes back to Zias stormy depths.There was a hardness to the woman in front of her now jagged edges that were rougher than Delphines. It was understandable why of course. Delphine had not needed to kill had not needed to do things that would keep her up for too long at night in her pursuit of the goals shed set for herself. But Zia obviously had and profited for it. Would Delphine dare do this? Cast aside what little innocence she had left in the pursuit of power? She had the feeling she would. And revel in it.Yet if it left her as lonesome as she was now would it really be what she wanted?But theres no other way... Even now you are alone fending for yourself. The only way forward is up.I think the Realm is changing Delphine said with a smile sipping at her wine which was beginning to make her buzz warmly. Made for men but fit to rule by women I think. And the sweetest thing is theyll never even see us coming she added with a chuckle.It was true. No one would see her as a threat if she rose to the position of Harvest Prince. Maybe not even when she moved higher than that. She was a girl a lovely face and a pair of plump lips to think of fondly at night and look at during meetings. No more. They didnt see the flame inside of her the hunger for more for more than they could ever give her.But he does she thought with a pang of regret a jolt of pain running through her.Syraphos blue eyes came to her mind again hurt and hurtful denying her his presence and a chance to give back a little. She had no clue what to do with the man. She couldnt make him leave and even less could she make him stay. A mystery and an infuriating one that had seeped into her existence and tinted it ocean blue. Sourly she took another sip looking at Zia.I believe youll be hardpressed to find a less talented student. But I would be thankful for lessons especially.... Delphine trailed off reaching for the bottle at her side. Shed have to retrieve the next one soon. It was good to hear that Zia had someone she could trust at least someone closer. Delphine had Darryn and she felt incredibly exposed without him at her side even more so now with everything that was going on with Syraphos. To Malirin she could only speak of the cold clinical facts the anger she felt and the disappointment. Never anything else. Shed tried and the look of utter hurt shed seen reflected back in Malirins hazel depths had been too much to bear.Another you will hurt.It twisted her up inside like a spear being turned in her gut.What happened? she echoed curling her legs underneath herself after kicking off the slippers shed been wearing. I fear I had another taste of Braavos again. And it might have been flavored with some dramatics of my own making.She fell silent for a moment knowing that she was not saying much. Delphine bit her lip hands still idly in her hair before looking up and meeting the questioning worried gaze of her friend.Tell me Zia. What do you think of the Fisher Prince of Lorath? What questions or answers does he incite in you? Speak plainly please.,IronThroneRP,cz38tgp,3,t5_345ny

All he knew was that it was not imagination which placed Delphine in his arms sleeping soundly against him. It was not something he so easily wished to give up despite his better judgement.Indeed he felt tiredness encroaching upon his own person sped along faster than hers had by the dull throbbing of his arm. Yet he knew that despite the soft wishes of his heart that he could not keep Delphine here with him for the night not even to sleep curled up together on the seat in a loving and chaste embrace.But would it be only mine which is chaste and loving while a womans be cold and manipulative? But she didnt seem to act in that way did she? He had learnt long ago in a lesson only reinforced by this evening to never simply allow that Delphine was as she seemed. A talk with the Sealord would be in order perhaps during business he could manage to find some way to bring the conversation around to the lioness now curled in his arms.For he still did not know what he would wake up to tomorrow whether it would be the Delphine of old or new. All good things must end at their first taste that later they may come and endure longer. Yet still a part of him questioned just how much of his thoughts were based off of lies. She had told him quite plainly that she had never lied to him...Was that true? Were all the lies he seemed to perceive just misunderstanding and faulted to himself?If that was true then Syraphos was at a greater fault than he had ever imagined...Or was he? Is it not a womans fault for leading a man to believe these things? Yet even as the thought left his mind the ridiculousness was made clear. One thing was certain while Delphine would sleep calmly and peacefully through the night...Syraphos would not.Rising to his feet was a challenge and keeping Delphine from toppling down onto the floor moreso. Yet somehow he managed it though whether she had been awoken he could not tell. The pain was great indeed he almost dropped her as he felt the spikes and rivets drive into his shoulder. For even as light as she was Delphine put strain that was sure to prolong his injury as he held her in his arms.Nevertheless he stood there for a few moments staring down at her this confusing and insufferable woman now curled up into a harmless ball in his arms yawning as sleep overtook her in a way he found most charming.But now he was faced with a new dilemma whether or not to traverse the halls as he was now clad in but his trousers or to set Delphine down and dress himself. Yet he could not bear the thought of waking her he knew she wouldnt allow him to carry her and insist she stumble her way back to her own room.He thought for a moment of leaving her upon his bed sleeping himself in his chair for the night. Yet if the old Delphine to return the embarrassment she would suffer he knew would be intense once more driving away a woman who had just begun to show herself to him in a softer light.No it had to be her room. A more arduous trip he could not remember yet it was one made well worth it every time he looked down to see her placid features even once or twice causing him to chuckle softly as her nose twitched or she scrunched up her face though for what reason he could not guess.Finally though they had arrived back at her room yet with the door closed he knew not what to do for certainly in his weakened state he would never be able to pull the door open while holding her instead he sufficed with a soft knock on the door.,IronThroneRP,cza4lnb,2,t5_345ny

She wanted to speak to the man but if he arrived unannounced she wasnt sure how shed handle it. Oh sure make sure he doesnt step off his ship or come into the city with more than twenty men at his back make sure they were carrying no weapons and beyond that but she still found it odd that he would come unannounced. How soon will he be arriving? Maella questioned no waver in her voice. She seemed almost expressionless though a hint worry touched her lips. She tried to hold it back but she failed. Terribly.Gesturing with a hand the gate began to open before them pushed by the two men who had been harrying Raan before. You speak to Maella Narratys of the ancient House of Narratys windrider of Her Banner and Once Queen of Westeros. Adding that to the title would maybe raise a few eyebrows  she hadnt called herself a Queen since she had come back from Westeros almost thirty years ago. She still missed that crown though that Aurion had made for her. She couldnt believe that once she had aspired to have her daughter be a Queen. She might still be one day.I am the best person you can speak to right now seeing as the Prince has essentially gone into hiding. In any case my power extends throughout all of Pentos and to her borders. Come in Master Raan. She gestured for him to follow her inside once the gates were open her steps equal and serene.

6468653,0,t1_cznpn59,Screams echoed off the stone cliffs of the mountain. The bloodthirsty roars of his own men emboldened by his own words streaming forth to annihilate their foes unkempt furwearing misfits with cumbersome stone axes and and the occasional glint of cruel steel. Blood flowed and fell steaming into the freshfallen snow from slashed throats spilling cuts and punctures so deep they wept red tears so dark they might as well be black.Arlan whipped his head around surveying the tide of the battle by some miracle still ahorse. They had them practically broken and on the run but it wasnt over yet.Form up! his voice commanded those nearest him over the screaming steel and wildling war cries. Not a single Wildling will break this line!Eldric! His brothers voice did not reach through his pure white plate besmirched by dust and blood. He stood near the back end of the lines his horse gone who knows where naked steel still a virgin in battle. Arlan could see his eyes through the steel and the back of his head. Wide with terror stuck fastened to the gleeful faces of butchers and the dying grimaces of old goats hearing their last breathes cutA blow from behind sent Eldric sprawling forward into the dirt.Gods damn it Eldric get a hold of yourself.He blinked through his helm and staring at the ruts of some old wagon wheel and stood back up to return his brother Arlans glacial gaze. Arlan pointed to the left flank.Cover. The. Left. Flank. He spat each word out between his teeth as the shoats rang all around them. Almost thought hed have to give him another whap with the Lady before the boy nodded and he relaxed spurring his horse toward the right flank Surround them. Hold the line. Theyll break if they cant go forward.Eldric nodded again vaguely as though he were in a daze but tapped some men on the shoulder and pushed themselves to the flanks. This is the brother whos been giving me so much trouble? the elder Corbray almost laughed at the absurdity of his brother waddling away in his mail and gathered up a few men to rush surround their right flank before it swelled up and over their own by the sheer weight of wildling bodiesMatthos and Redsword have the center I doubt I could order them in any event. Ill have to hope they hold it and trust Eldric remembers any of Ellyrions war room lessons. I did give him the mountain side though. Theyd have to be fools to try to retreat up the mountain. He took another quick survey of the field as Artys and Lady Sunderland engaged the ragtag host charging up the hill and he was surprised to see Lord Eons archers charging up their rear. He frowned even as the battle raged around him. Even if these bastards gain the hill the battle is won anyway. Dividing forces between the two is unnecessary Lady Sudnerland and Lord Artys could handle a mountain clansman or two. Perhaps the codgers not as clever as I thought...Arlans band arrived just as the wildlings began to take the edge of their line a single brownbearded man with a nostril and an ear cut off Frostbite probably.Lord Corbray raised his sword high and dug his spurs in to ride with the sprinting of mailed soldiers with hidebound shields.Keep them back! He shouted as he sliced through an old axe haft like it were butter with his Lady and into its poor bearers skull. Surround them on three sides! No one breaks the line no one goes around it! We end them here Valemen my brothers!Still Arlan kept a watchful eye on the horizon back where the Wildlings had come and every now and then found himself looking over his shoulder as he dueled some man with a sword hed no doubt stolen years ago judging by the rust. Its too easy a little voice inside him whispered war is never easy.,IronThroneRP,czoekrc,2,t5_345ny

6554938,0,t3_45bblh,The sail from Pentos to Braavos was no easy task and took considerable time. As always the one thing that Darryn didnt enjoy about travelling was the travel itself. On the way several smaller towns and locations had been visited by the crew of Leiya and the ships accompanying it with two left behind in Pentos to arrange for a shipment of southern goods to come up after them in a week or two to be sold in Braavos Lorath and possibly some sent to Ibb. Delphine had made very specific requests of Darryn on what she wanted returned to Lorath and he had followed them to a tee slipping in this and that where he found it suitable as well.Fortunately for him the travel had been made easier by good company kept. Nymor had revealed himself as a decent conversationalist and theyd spent evenings over the Cyvasse board talking strategy and the plans the young trader had for his conquest of the Rhoyne while Darryn had countered with his own love for adventure and that gnawing feeling that there had to be something better out there. What he was not entirely sure but he was damn sure he wanted to find it posthaste.When they arrived at Braavos it was with somewhat of a heavy heart that Darryn watched the Chequy Port drag closer knowing that it would come with hours of customs dealings. As much as hed grown fond of Braavos then it was too close to home yet still not so and as such he could not take all the joy from it that he thought he should be able to.Perhaps a visit to the courtesans is in order before I leave he thought glumly flicking a quick look at Nymella as he neared them standing by the railing of the ship.It had been somewhat uncomfortable having the young mischievous woman share a ship with him. It was not lost on him that she was a flirtatious one which meshed well with his own energy and the mix of trade and personal talk quickly got to a point where Darryn wished hed brought one of those delightful Pentosi maidens with him if for no other reason than to subdue the urge to corner Nymors cousin. Still hed managed to behave himself and he was sure he could manage further if need be but it had manifested in quite a few early morning and late night sword practices on the rocking decks of the ship as a way to vent his frustration.A fine morning to conquer Braavos hmm? Darryn said absently giving his guests a smile as he looked to the wharf. His eyes met with a man waiting patiently by the men readying to secure the ship for boarding by the custom agents and the way he peered at Darryn made it obvious to him that the man had been sent to seek him out. With a frown he raised his hand in greeting. Who do you look for messenger? he asked spotting the parchment in his hand sealed as it was.A Darryn Demion my lord he called back.You have found him then Darryn answered with an easy smile. Throw your message if you are in a hurry!The man nodded taking from his pocket a smooth bit of obsidian and a long string wrapping the piece of parchment around the diskshaped stone. With a flick of his wrist he tossed the letter and the stone Darryn catching it as it flew high reaching over his shoulder. It was an old trick the Lorathis used to pass messages between the ships on the sea something his uncle had taught him. One word from the man had confirmed him as a Lorathi as well and as such the decision had been easy enough to make.Come back this eve if you need your fee Darryn said unwrapping the stone and the string. Thats alright sire. The lady paid in full he replied with a bow of his head before turning around on his heel and making a hurried exit while Leiya was only beginning to be secured.Intrigue this early in our trip to Braavos Darryn commented depositing the stone and string in the pocket of his dark green tunic. How riveting.His eyes glossed over the curt scarce words before he pursed his lips thoughtfully nodding. Delphine had left Braavos weeks ahead of him but had left him with a task easy enough hopefully to master.It seems that we are not quite done with Pentos he said folding the note and slipping it into his pocket once more. For it seems the fine presence of Lorathi is so adored by those of the distant city that even in Braavos I am called upon to amaze and thrill. He chuckled slightly leaning forward on the rail to rest his elbows. A visit to the Sealords Palace seems to be in order soon. But tell me with all the schemes and plots revealed to me so far I am yet to understand where we shall start unraveling your plans for Braavos Nymor.

The first time in a very long time he was able to do so with someone of his own blood.Family...It was a comforting thought after the events of Raventree Hall and Brandons death. Finally having some kind of tie to someone who is ones own kin by blood and not by name or title or position.Someone of his blood who did not hate him even if they merely wanted something from him...And yet the ideas of the situation raced around in his mind... He could see her and the child safe passage to the same world hes been in across the Narrow Sea......There would be time to think of such ideas. For now she was safe  and that was what was important.For no matter the family in Westeros nor how powerful or rich they might be the ship which Lady Alys set foot on was a Volantene ship and by treatise and law she would be granted certain protections.However... Those protections only went so far as long as she was in Kings Landing... a city which Robb all too well knew to be overshadowed by villainy and deception.But where would she go then...? The Valaar family. Aerion. Rhaenys. One of them. Robb thought to himself as he took Alys in his arms. Aerion or Rhaenys either one would perhaps understand and honor my request....Dont worry.

6679274,0,t1_d0a0hu9,From a young age Rogar had been aware of his familys reputation and the way it made people react to his name. Hed never flinched from it nor tried to soften that image but rather used it as a tool at his disposal. He was perfectly at home with icons of death and sufferinghe always wore an iron ring in the shape of a man bent backwards around his finger with wrists lashed to ankles face contorted in agony. When Gareth Tyrell approached him about courting Lyarra and admitted that hed been wary about approaching King Edderion Rogars response had been So rather than look the wolf in the eye youve decided to pry open his jaws and gaze at his teeth? Audacious of you. It neatly summed up his perception of his role in the Northern Court. He was willing to do what others were not for the sake of the realm if it came to that. If people chose to forsake the benevolence of the Starks they would experience the cruelty of the Boltons in its full measure if thats what it took to maintain peace and order. Rogar had never been as close to the queen as hed been with Edderion and his siblings. After all hed been one of Brandon Starks closest friends and had known all of the Princes and Princesses since infancy. But shed certainly been at Winterfell long enough to see that he wore marks of mourning. He favored black ordinarily but his normal house sigil with the flayed man rendered in red enamel had been replaced by a plainer one of blackened iron. Hed worn it when Berena Stark had died when Queen Lysara had died when King Brandon died and when Willam Stark died. Now he wore it for Edrick. Your Grace He replied when she greeted him and set his sword aside and rose from the bench hed been seated upon to greet her.Thank you he replied to her well wishes. As am I. Ive had more than enough of staring at the same four walls and ceiling to last me for a very long time. Its good to breathe in fresh air again. She asked how he was feeling and he answered honestly Not fully myself yet but better. He was of an age where recovery from illness was a slow process if it came at all. Hed been deeply worried that he might be reduced to an invalid as his father had been but he could feel himself getting stronger could measure that the distance he could walk without tiring was slowly getting longer. And yourself my Queen? How are you today? Which was a deceptively complicated question considering that he was asking that of a grieving mother mourning her firstborn childs murder but he was letting her set the tone of the conversation. This was far too public a setting for any substantive conversation about Edricks death even if theyd been close enough to have one however. ,IronThroneRP,d0a71yi,1,t5_345ny

One day she would inquire as to what made him react so violently to her scorn but this was not the day. Still as it usually did the blue eyes filling with confusion and remorse made her feel entirely guilty another in a long line of emotions Delphine did not favor. Her hand remained on her shoulder rubbing the ghost of a bruise that had been left there once by Syraphos hand on a day when he certainly had not looked taken aback by anything that Delphine could have said or done.This has gone too far Were not even courting and yet these highs and lows keep coming and going.It churned her gut feeling vulnerable before him and having him look as if he felt much the same. Though how and why they had gotten to such a position she would not know and if anyone were to question what led to it she doubted that she could truly pinpoint the moment that things had gone from light to dark to difficult in the joint idiocy of Demion and Sorrah.As he paced past her she almost thought he would pull her into his arms and she wasnt entirely sure if shed fight it now. But he did not opting for almost cold complacency as he had done before as well putting more distance more space between them. Her breath caught a little as he paused at the door and she felt incredibly stupid for putting them both in a situation that could only hurt them. Was there truly a point to struggle onwards with a match that was so difficult to make? The more she thought about it the more she cursed herself for having stopped him that eve when he promised to leave her alone for good if that was what she wanted. Giving Dephera to him seemed like such a more gentle option for all parties involved now. It would not make anyone entirely happy but it would certainly not make the two great minds of Lorath twist themselves up over petty emotion either.Things are simply different than what they were she finally admitted with a sigh not meeting his gaze her eyes downcast. And a woman finds ones self questioning how well they stand up to scrutiny when removed from the safety of a city that does not know a woman or a man well enough to have opinion on either.She shrugged her shoulders and even she could sense how stiff the motion must have been. A man is not at fault for this any more than a woman is. Now she glanced up at him and indeed that tiredness that hovered about her as a fog seemed all the more prevalent. Not a weakness no but a weariness of all that was weighing her down and threatening to drown her if she let it. The intricate web of deceit and bribes that she had knit to become Harvest Princess  a meaningless title if there ever was one  her brothers betrothal the family business and Syraphos as a looming presence over it all seemed to finally be catching up with her and she wasnt entirely sure if she could handle it all.,IronThroneRP,d0hcf9s,3,t5_345ny

His stormy blue eyes narrowed seeming intent on boring through her to peer into her mind into what had caused this sudden change.He actually took a half step back when she moved towards him wincing as he almost believed for a moment that she would try to take him into her arms. No that would not work this time he would not be so easily lulled into agreement by her touch.A prince can now obviously see a woman cannot run a campaign the same way a man does! For when a man ran a campaign the letter of his bargains and agreements were stuck to! A woman seems intent that this not be the case however a man certainly begins to feel ill used! Syraphos stalked off about the table putting it between them before once more turning to her hands digging into the tables edge as he fought the urge to send it toppling onto its side.Besides that would ruin the Cyvasse set which would not make De There it went again for some reason even when he was angry he found himself wanting to do what would make Delphine happy and that alone almost convinced him to upend the table his pointed glare turning once more on the woman who he had hoped to court after today.Whether that would still be the case whether there was any hope...Well that was up to Delphine now. Or if a woman is truly intent on ending a courtship perhaps a wish should just be used to that cause. His tone seemed to become more somber a hurt look hard to keep off his face though it still crept into the corners of his visage. If that is so then be done with it all the quicker a man does not like not knowing when he has been used and set aside clarity always is sought.The thoughts all the doubts and worries returned. His gaze did not flicker away from her as he reached over the table taking his king and pushing it over on its side. If any of this is the case...Then a woman has won a blind was certainly pulled over a mans eyes! This a man will not forget if true!But a man also demands an explanation a woman owes a man that after all this at least no?

She stood in front of it and stared at the face which was engraved into its trunk.. And slowly her emerald eyes wandered up to the branches which disappeared within their red leaves. Its so beautiful.. She thought out loud. Where was that word she needed?Roslin turned her head so that she might look at Roger. Thank you for bringing me here..

Her worn fingers paused in their movement as the door creaked open having leafed through pages scrawled in a foreign tongue hundreds of years before for hours before the sun had risen. The bistered gaze of the Martell met Vayon Dayne as his knuckles rapped upon it a pleasant smile becoming of her features.  The days following her wedding had allowed those in her service time to themselves to each other and to the beauty of the island. The last she had seen of the Lord of Starfall he had been among the many eyes to watch her walk the path to the altar. Her summons had been delivered by a guardsman in the soft red gold plating of her embellishment as the morning birds sang. The princess nodded her affirmation before straightening her posture in her chair her hands fastening in her lap hidden from view behind the ancient desk before her.  Vayon her tone was warm her lips curled. Ive need of your advice my friend. Please sit she gestured towards an empty chair just across from where she was seated. A slight lift of her chin would see to drinks administered by her handmaiden. Once the clink of glass and spoons quieted and her books had been slid away across the desk her expression became a guise of seriousness though her fondness was omnipresent. I am worried I must say.

7399397,0,t1_d2j9e4k,The trip to Sarnor took several months during which they lost a person or two from the group of  people whod started out from the colony.  The expedition arrived at Vaes Khewo first inspecting the ruins of the sacked and abandoned city during which they lost another member when he fell from the top of a three story manse breaking his neck when he hit the ground.However in the City of the Tall Towers that mansion was by far not the highest structure from that one could have fallen. The Dothraki might have taken the most impressive objects from the ruined city leaving but the bare stone walls however still in that state the Dornish travellers would find themselves overwhelmed with the large buildings that bespake an ancient glorious civilization. After they had walked the streets that got ever narrower the closer they approached the citys center the small group with Lady Cerennas close companion Deria stood in front of the famed Palace With a Thousand Rooms.The palace looked like it couldve seen much better days but some of its majesty remained namely in the utter size of the structure due to the eponymous rooms that would be contained inside the stone that once would have formed an almost even surface but now was worn by wind and weather. As many of the blocks stacked to form the palace had shrunk at their corners the general impression the palace gave was not one of stability but the group appeared to be intent on searching this crucial building of the ruined city though after the numerous raids that must have occurred on behalf of various Dothraki khalasars the hope to find treasures within the palace wouldve been slim. But there may have been rooms or treasure that theyd overlooked in their haste to plunder and exit the city the group would just have to find whatever they overlooked and hopefully itd be of some value. Cerenna led the expedition into the palace taking care to avoid any pits in the floor and ran into blocked off passages more than once forcing the group to backtrack and find alternate routes. Eventually they found some treasure but it was mostly gold and some jewelry in a room the Dothraki hadnt plundered of its treasures leading them to think there may be other rooms that had unplundered treasures. The group began methodically searching the unblocked off rooms finding some old dusty tomes in the palaces library and treating them with care.After the group had left the comparatively safe terrain close to the road that led from the Free Cities towards Vaes Dothrak which they had followed for quite a time up to Vaes Khewo and entered the Great Grass Sea proper most notably a drier terrain due to the lack of rivers for the most part the party dwindled all the more. While the area around the cities of Slavers Bay was avoided due to the undefined political situation the mountains around the Khyzai Pass were passed by to the east where they bordered the plains of Lhazar. The group now consisting of  people Lady Cerenna and Deria among them travelled the lands of the Lamb People in overall safety and finally after many weeks that almost amounted to half a year since they had left the settlement in Sar Mell reached Old Ghis another of those places Cerenna had intended to visit. The majority of the ruins of Old Ghis compared to the ruins of Sarnath appeared to be much more eroded and in danger of falling apart at the slightest provocation. They lost two more people from crumbling buildings but on the upside they found tarnished Ghiscari armor and weapons as well as equally tarnished jewelry and a few relics to take back to Westeros. Whether or not the relics were Valyrian steel isnt known for certain because the Lady Cerenna had more plans and cast her gaze southeast to Asshai and the unknown continent of Ulthos.Deria who had been walking through the ruins of Old Ghis on her own for a while after they had found the weapons of unknown origin and material found Lady Cerenna who had throughout the expedition been the one to most actively urging for further travels and explorations standing atop of a small elevation her face directed towards the southeast. What are you thinking My Lady Deria asked in a curious tone. I do hope our findings here made you content. Was it not such artifacts you were searching?The Dornishwoman turns to look at Deria interrupted in her musings. Aye what we found here is amazing but theres . Im considering going to Valyria or to Asshai but have yet to decide on which location would be the better to visit given the reputation they both have.Truly one cannot say of a safe reputation for those places at all Deria responded seeing a certain recklessness however at least balanced by a deep musing on Lady Cerennas behalf. If we would go into Valyria we could die or come closer to our home she mused aloud. As for Asshai we would possibly never return either way. Deria gave a shrug in her intentions made slightly more adaptable during all the time travelling through Essos.I still intend to visit Asshai to see whether the rumors surrounding the city are true. The Dornishwomans gaze sweeps southeast again expression remaining the same. Besides we would actually bring back useful information about the size of the city and its inhabitants to Westeros in addition to the lore treasure and knowledge we find there. And yes it might be selfish of me but I wish to surpass the Sea Snake and travel to areas he hasnt visited.Deria smiled at Cerennas remark and cheekily answered hiding her initial concerns about a such extended adventure. The gain in knowledge shall be immense I should suppose she said. And would I that likely have joined this expedition were I disinclined towards personal ambition? She nodded her head once more and turned her look to the southeast as well.,IronThroneRP,d2j9gp5,1,t5_345ny

Mathis shrugged off the hand on his shoulder and stepped around Aegor to retrieve Wolvesbane which lied buried amongst the letters and ornaments surrounding the desks upturned belly. Mathis scoffed. Assault! he repeated the word the taste of it sour on his tongue. He was as helpless as a child and you were in no danger. You had a sword guards myself. Ser Rickard barely got the desk off the ground. Do you think Im blind or stupid? he asked as he picked up the sword Say what you want about just kings but no honourable king would have done what you did. My family perhaps  theyll likely support it  but no honourable king of memory would be so arbitrary. Mathis approached Aegor again sword pointed down. You want me to believe you? Then dont peddle your lies to me Aegor. And dont try to make me peddle them back to you either.

Oswin had pursued rather simple intentions until now  knighthood which he had achieved learning the ruling of a keep and at some point in the future the marriage to a Lady with whom he would continue House Egen  but more and more he realised that other events affected his plans as well and that there was a need to adjust.No need to become an opportunist though he thought reaffirming himself if one can apply ones ideals to the changed situation as well getting deeper in thought himself as well when he first actually noticed Lord Arryn standing aside of them without returning his countenance for a while.

Blood should usually triumph.. the Sverri were getting tense. ..However the law still stands. She was his wife and should get the rights a widow is due even if she is childless. However.. now the Hakons were holding their breath..being secure does not mean the land? She is young no doubt shell want to marry. Perhaps someone younger this time. She wants a dowry though as a widow is of reduced stature so.. he pointed at the Hakon leader. You shall keep the land but you must ensure that the widow has financial securitysay paid a percentage of the value of the land each year in several installments. Iver shall establish the specifics. You of course will retain the income of the land. If you default however the land will be given back to the widow.. Robard leaned in. And if we find evidence of a deliberate withholding of obligations then I can assure you that much more will be forfit. He turned to the Sverri. You will get recompense now be satisfied and treat the widow as she deserves. And if you disobey my ruling and continue this feud then Ill have hesitation in exiling the offender and splitting the land between Hakon and the widow. Is that understood?

The wine was soaking through her linen sheets and the metal carafe banged against the wood as it was flung off the bed. How she had got under Maegor she was not sure. She felt the fire that burned when their skin collided and the next minute she felt his weight against her stomach and his predatory eyes looming down on her.Almost instinctively she brought her hands up to her chest hands turning into fists and blocking her chest. But the attack never came? She met his savage eyes hers wide and clear like a doe would be in the face of a hunter. Slowly he moved down and she tensed up ready to fight back but only a peck on her lips was his assault. She stared at him for what felt like hours but only lasted a few moments.You ruined my sheets... was the only words to come out of her lips. And the medium in which he ruined it seemed all wrong. Naerys expected her sheets to be red with her blood or a mixture of theirs not plum wine. And you made the wine go... I am excited by you.Excited by me? Me excited by you? she started to chuckle propping herself up on an elbow the other brushing a few strands of silver waves out of her face. There was a hungry look deep in her eyes camouflaged by fear or amusement or whatever else she could be possibly feeling. She was confused though. How did this dragon bring this out in her? Bring out this primal and bestial urge?I bet you that you are only excited because I am not flinging myself at your feet. I am sure your others... This was turning into a weird conversation. She always heard stories of gallant knights rescuing their princesses not a bloodthirsty lord with a sexual deviancy Your other fucks just spread their legs and flashed their cunts. Youve never had to fight for it have you? She leaned up even more looking up at him with challenging eyes Youve never had to fight hm?

This had bred a loyalty and respect from his men that was somewhat unusual for Ironborn. Inevitably some of them would die in the upcoming battle. Their deaths will not be in vain. Cleos sheathed his short sword. But deaths there will be. A cup for good fortune? The red priest held up a cup of blood. Cleos took it and downed it in one the warm liquid oozing down his throat. He handed the cup back has the scourge been prepared? It has. I will use it for a short while before returning to this. Cleos indicated to his sword. He and his men were dressed in full Tawney regalia red and white flying proudly. Cleos wore dark red padded leather with some light white chainmail. He had made sure that it was easily detachable in the case of going overboard. Similarly his white helm with red nettle engravings was not attached for easy removal. Cleos liked to fight with a shield in his left hand and a short sword in his right though he would occasionally switch it out for an axe. However he might not be needing his weapons as he was confined to the deck of the War Pig. He had provided his lieutenants and captains any appropriate orders and would try his best to oversee them. But it might be difficult in the heat of battle. There was still much tension and division among the Iron Fleet so Cleos was taking some men with him aboard Urrigons ship. Mostly to help organise his forces but also for protection. Protection from both Redwyne and Ironborn. Any bastard could slit my throat and chalk it up to wars hell. Cleos sighed. This would be a tough fight. One to remember if nothing else.,IronThroneRP,d692e6m,1,t5_345ny

Not one whod ever spent much time with the opposite sexwith exception for his late wife in the short time that they knew one another prior to her passingeven small acts of chivalry towards a woman that wasnt his mother or sister seemed strange and foreign.  Even so he remembered his knighthood oaths well and he ignored his discomfort as he usually did.  He would have offered her assistance atop her bay as well but she seemed to know what she was doing and decided against it.He was atop his destrier within seconds or so it seemed looking off towards the waterline in search of a way through.  When she brought up the crossing he merely nodded as he waited for her to lead the way.  From a distance the stream didnt look overly dangerous but the water was moving fast and he sensed that passing through could be dangerous especially if one wasnt careful or skilled in maneuvering a horse through treacherous conditions.  He looked to Brea studying her and quietly assessing her ability as she rode past him.  Shed made it far on her own and he knew she knew the land well but her horse was an old thing more timid than what he expected for someone like her.Very well he agreed after they had been riding for several seconds.  His expression returned to its usual calm with his attention alternating between the stream and their surroundings.  It was rare for bandits or clansmen to venture so deep into Hersy lands but watching for danger was a habit he would likely never kick.  And so he remained quiet and watchful and it seemed the horse was well suited for its master for it too remained silent save for its steady breathing and even footsteps.  Though he didnt speak Lyonel exuded presence and occasionally looked her way though his stare never stayed long.It wasnt until several minutes later that he finally did speak.

The man spoke politely though he had a look of slight disdain on his face and he then promptly turned and walked away from the door. Andrew sighed now he had to get redressed and put on something nicer for the day. He had planned on working with the few men that were left to be trained though most of them were old men or green boys who had never held a sword before in their life. He smiled as he remembered those days back when he was a squire being trained by callous old knights yelling orders at him to Fucking swing like you mean it boy! He intended to be different than that though. Andrew had only been in the castle for a few days now and he thought he was making friends with some of the younger men he trained though the older ones seemed to look down on him as if he were a green boy himself at first they quickly changed their mind when they realized he was actually quite a competent fighter. He dressed himself in a fine tunic with a small Florent badge over his heart and some fine black trousers then headed out the door.As he stepped outside he was greeted with a dreary scene. Was the name Brightwater Keep a sarcastic jape? So far hed seen nothing but grey skies and rain since he arrived. Ah well least its not raining. He began to cross the courtyard past some young boys sparring with each other one easily beating the other. Andrew crossed over to the pair as they fought watching for a few moments as the much more skilled boy knocked the other to the ground. What were their names again? Byron and Osmund. Byron was the one whod just been knocked on the ground. Andrew reached down and helped the boy up. You need to get your shield up Byron else Osmund over there will be able to best you every time. He told the young boy.But ser its so heavy! The lad whined slightly.Thats no excuse youll just have to get used to the weight. A knight needs a shield just as much as he needs a sword. Andrew explained with a small smile on his face trying to seem friendly.Alright...Ill practice more. Byron said somewhat sadly. Andrew patted him on the head and began to walk across the yard tot he Great Hall where Lady Lyra no doubt waited for him. He entered the hall a smile on his face as usual even in this dreary weather Andrew could find something to smile about.Lady Lyra Lady Jeyne. He said as he bowed to the two Florents.

All I know is that youre all coming to my castle to discuss whatever it is Lord Tyrell has called everyone here for. Stannis explained.My cousin is fond of his western friends its true. Lorent is a good man though and I believe he is a good Hand as well. Though when he becomes King who knows if your Small Council positions will be secure Lord Arlan. The Stag said plainly. He laughed at the mention of Targaryens. The only way a Targaryen will ever come to Kings Landing is with an army at his back. Three times theyve tried and three times theyve failed. No. Lord Tyrell has something entirely different planned. I may go confront him myself soon and see what he is planning. I do not like this being in the dark one bit. Stannis said ignoring the mention of gold.The Order is here to ensure the city is kept....Orderly. If the Gold Cloaks are wise they will accept the Orders assistance with open arms thieves and other lowlifes will be attracted by the rich lords flocking to the city. So yes security. Stannis nodded. Your uncle has come to the city yes. Ive been meaning to talk with him soon as time permits. Perhaps you should stop by and visit with him as well. Or dont it makes no difference to me. Stannis turned to look at the Master of Coin. Was there something you needed my lord? Or was a simple chat all you had planned? ,IronThroneRP,da99ikw,1,t5_345ny

He felt that if not for the presence of Sansa it would have gone on endlessly back and forth forever. And honestly as he glanced once more at those beautiful shimmering eyes the Lord of Parchments did not think he would mind one single bit.Nevertheless I am sure despite any clumsiness we both might have that you are one of the most beautiful of my aunts handmaidens. The error didnt dawn at him at first that kindly smile remaining on his face for a few moments yet. But Cyrella could see the moment he realized his mixup of words. Dutiful dutiful! Cyressas own colouring had not been surprassed Lewys hastily setting down his wine glass of which he had not yet touched. Dutiful yes. My apologies I meant to say dutiful! I have not had much to eat today thus the wine seems all the stronger. I of course meant dutiful. You do a great service to my dearest aunt I am sure.It was a welcome distraction the few moments he had to arise to bid farewell to his sisters composing himself as best he could as he moved his way back around to sit across from Cyrella once more. Lewys loved riding always had...He considered himself an expert at it yet he nodded sympathetically as Cyrella explained her own topics on the matter. Well then there is certainly no need for a ride if it makes you uncomfortable! And such a fear may indeed be well placed with the majority of horses I imagine!When she still mentioned a supper even after his own blunders the smile on Lewys face did seem to widen. Yes let us go for a walk dear Lady Cyrella. I think you might even convince me that walking is better than riding better for the physique I hear with much more observable effects. And then came the demand she seemed so eager so forward. Too forward almost. A hint of suspicion did cross Lewys mind one that never would have been dreamt of if they had not been in Kings Landing a city with such a repute for scheming.Lewys slowly rose to his feet making his way across to offer Cyrella his arm up folding hers within his comfortably. I think Lady Cyrella. That I can more than happily say that tonight shall most likely be the finest supper I ever have had... But what if she meant the invitation to his sisters as well? Did she? Propriety might dictate she did oh she most likely was offering it to all of them it was a visit friendly after all! ...Should I extend the invitation to my sisters then or leave a note for them on my return I mean? There that seemed to Lewys a delicate way enough to ask without sounding like he wished for one certain outcome or the other.  ,IronThroneRP,dabtp3f,1,t5_345ny

Stannis said plainly as he stood to leave for his chambers to put on some finer clothing to wear to this waste of time. Undoubtedly this was his cousins attempt at courting the Iron Orders commander. Go and keep an open mind see how the man compares to Orys at the least. Stannis thought as he began the walk up the stairs.He entered his chambers where he found his wife Shiera with their youngest daughter Sansa a child of two. Stannis walked over and kissed his wife and daughter on the forehead then went to gather some nicer clothes.Where are you off to Stan? Shiera asked her husband.Berons invited me to a dinner in the city. Ill be back tonight though. Stannis said with a smile as he answered his wife.Once hed changed Stannis had his horse prepared for the ride into the city. His party consisted of himself five Rustcloaks and his squire Lucas. The ride into the city was an uneventful one and soon Stannis and his party found themselves outside of Berons manse. The Iron Stag approached the gate and introduced himself. Grand Marshal Stannis Baratheon here for Prince Berons dinner party. The gate was opened for Stannis who turned back to his men. Dont go too far. He ordered as he stepped onto the manses grounds.He entered the manse and found Prince Beron standing in front of five Rustcloaks. Stannis nodded at the knights and greeted Prince Beron. Good afternoon my Prince. I thank you for the invitation to your party.Once hed greeted his Princely cousin Stannis would proceed to look around the manse observing some tapestries on the wall while he waited for the rest of the guests to arrive.

The younger maesters that he met were ugly thin or otherwise repulsive but Uthor seemed alright. The man might have been easily mistaken for a tourney knight if he didnt bear the robes and the links of a maester.Surely the library here in the Red Keep is a humble collection compared to the great libraries of the Citadel Vernon noted. But yes I suppose this is a moderately impressive library compared to a usual castles collection anyway he admitted.Im not so sure maester. I spend quite a lot of time in this place as my duties demand. No man could ever study every book in their lifetimes but I try to learn as much as I can.

I intend to follow up the matter of payment with the Triarchs near immediately to strike while the land surrounding their city still smoulders. If there prepayment was anything to gauge their generosity on then we should have funds to recruit many more to our cause bolstered by the strength Triarch Horonno has promised us. When the Westerosis hear of the battle they will rejoice thinking us weakened whilst the opposite remains undeniably the case.He paused mulling over a thought for a moment.And if nothing else it was a show of strength and capability and if captains of sellsword companies across the Disputed Lands and the rest of Essos do not appreciate that then let them hear tales of the payment granted to us for our service perhaps that will attract them to our side instead.,IronThroneRP,dcksyh1,1,t5_345ny
10387266,0,t3_5oq5eq, Im just going to continue this from where we were at before for continuities sake. Im not saying the Baratheon is at all justified. She answered in turn frustrated. Obviously the taking and killing of Dornish men is to be punished and shamed regardless of circumstances. However this isnt just an isolated incident of a lord going rogue. War has been sitting on our horizon for weeks now regardless of what anyone has done to stop it. I am the same as you my lady. I held no regard for either Beron or Orys though it was true I did find Orys to be a bit inexperienced for the position. Dorne has always been the most important thing to me and my House. However the Princess and therefore Dorne threw her lot in with Orys and therefore the other lords will find us thusly accountable. My issue with how we approach this situation is that this could very well be the push that we go into war. And what shall we do if the Starks and the Tullys and Arryns join this war while half of our kin is in an island holdfast across the sea? Dorne has few ships and half of Kings Landings ships were burned as well. And if war were to come now and the ships of Kings Landing would be needed elsewhere how else would we retrieve them?! The kidnapping of innocents should be punished and hated. That much I think we can all agree upon. But we do not want to give any of the other neutral lords a reason to make Beron and his brother a martyr. If we push the Arryns and Tullys to the wrong side our kin are in danger of so much more than being kidnapped. We need to approach this in a way that the Brother Baratheon is shamed by all the lords in the realm. The Yronwood sighed and stood up straightening her back. Unfortunately I do not have the time to continue this. I ask esteemed lords and ladies of Dorne to keep my words in mind. I have to meet the Prince before anything is to happen. I wish you all luck for your sake and the sake of our kin. And with a nod the women headed out the jingling of her silks following her down the hall. ,IronThroneRP,dclgmc4,2,t5_345ny

Jon Barrowstark. The infants life was cut short and he died early no cause was ever discovered and Brandon sunk into a deep depression thereafter. Benjen quoted as he looked at Jon for a moment before shaking his head. And thats what happened and why the whole family moved to a new home.

Ill be sure not to set it down then was all Jonquil said a bit of dry humor in her voice as she took another sip. She would have to be careful here. Clarity of mind was key in interactions such as these. The last thing she needed at this juncture was to drink too much alcohol. Of course I dont expect you trust me she said honestly. I dont trust you either. Nobody in this world trusts anybody and rightfully so. Everyone is playing their own little games myself included.

The Kingsguard member who had arrived with him Ser Morrigen had been a man who had shown himself resourceful and reliable and as such he decided to bring the man up with him. One would not know what would be said and two ears to give the King the same message was better and more believable than one.The two men made their way into the room and at once Lorimer bowed deeply in respect I am humbled by your invitation and the feast you have prepared for us in your home my Lord. He said as he rose from his bow May I introduce to you the honourable Ser Morryn Morrigen of the Kingsguard. A man who has the Kings ear and guards his person with the utmost honour and integrity. He gestured to the man in white to come forward and introduce himself to Lord Arryn.uMMorrigen,IronThroneRP,ddd8gt3,1,t5_345ny

Still she nodded in agreement with the notion of Corvellas speech if not the letter of it. Then what would you suggest? she asked.

I want them back with no trouble you see and only you can provide this for me. He said as he poured a cup of wine for himself. Beric it seems will not release his captives unless I give you to him.

He said as he drank from his cup.You might also wish to know that I received a letter not long ago from Lady Marbrand. Myrcellas sister. It troubles me that she would beg for your release when Beric fails to do as I ask. He said as he walked over to Beron. So I wrote a response for the dear lady. I told her of how we are peacefully negotiating for peace in our realm. How we are in session most days trying to right this chaos and stop a war before it begins. I also told her that I would not harm you until such a thing happens. He offered as he leaned close to face Beron. Are you going to make me a liar or are you going to talk with me on these issues?

A simpler time. Quite suddenly Lewys saw not the Red Keeps evocative gardens but instead the squat hills of the land around Harrenhal. Quite suddenly the woman before him was not Jonquil Tarth the Evenstar but a mousy little thing who answered to Ashara.Ashara who had smiled even when he stumbled through his drills who had nursed his bumps and bruises who had held him as hed squeezed out those tears for the friend hed watched hang for the crime of being desperate. Ashara who had smelled of strawberries whose hair had been soft as silk who never not once pressed him for that which he did not wish to voice.Ashara who was too good for him.Who now lay with Symond.Who had birthed his son.For a bright and beautiful moment the struggles of the present became distant almost forgotten like a bad dream and that which hed lost existed in front of him close enough to touch.And then Lewys saw the cracks appear along his vision as if it were thin ice buckling under too much pressure and the moment fell away. Left him stood there with nothing but the sharp edge of his reality. Harrenhal became the Red Keep. Ashara became Jonquil. Happiness became a regret deep enough to drown the Kingdoms.Please.
