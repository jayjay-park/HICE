1666606,0,t3_2dgh4t,Although each level of jhna and each formless attainment growsincreasingly steady as you go up the series only the levels beginning with thefourth jhna are said to be imperturbable MN . Likewise releasing the mindis a progressive process You release the mind at least temporarily from theaffliction of attending to perceptions of sensuality on entering the first jhnafrom the affliction of attending to perceptions of directed thought on enteringthe second jhna and so on up through the cessation of perception and feeling.Finally release becomes total on reaching unbinding AN .The fourth tetradremaining focused on inconstancy dispassion cessationand relinquishingis like releasing the mind a process that develops throughprogressive levels of refinement while mastering concentration and then goesbeyond refinement with the attainment of total unbinding. When youre tryingto master concentration you direct these contemplations to any object thatwould distract you from your theme. In other words you focus thesecontemplations on anything that would provoke greed and distress withreference to the world outside of your concentration seeing the distraction ascomposed of events dhammas that are inherently unworthy of attachment. Inthis way you wean the mind from the distraction.When concentration is fully mastered you then turn these samecontemplations onto the world of becoming created around the concentrationitself. You see that it too is composed of dhammas that are inconstanteventhough the inconstancy is very subtleand from that insight you developdispassion for the process of continuing to fabricate anything at all even themost refined states of concentration. This dispassion puts an end to the passionthat fuels fabrication thus leading to cessation. At that point everythingevenpassion for the deathlessis relinquished and total unbinding occurs AN .In this way each of the tetrads provides its own perspective on the overalldevelopment of right concentration on the macro level.As for the micro level we will discuss some of the practical issuessurrounding each of the four tetrads in the next chapter. Here we will look attheir role in giving rise to the seven factors for awakening to show why MN singles this topic out for attention.The seven factors for awakening sambojjhaoga constitute one of the sevensets of dhammas included in the wings to awakening bodhipakkhiyadhamma theBuddhas own list of his most important teachings DN  DN  Ud . Theseven sets overlap in many ways and in some cases they differ primarily in theorder in which they list the qualities needed to attain awakening. For instancethe five faculties and five strengths describe how concentration leads todiscernment. The seven factors for awakening on the other handlike the nobleeightfold pathdescribe how discernment leads to concentration. In otherwords they describe the development of concentration in which insight plays aleading role. In this way they are congruent with the sixteen steps for as wehave noted the sixteen steps show how to develop tranquility and insight intandem when bringing the mind to concentration by focusing on how tounderstand and master the processes of fabrication.This congruence appears in the overall pattern of the seven factors forawakening which parallels the pattern of each of the four tetrads. The generalpattern is one of observing and understanding the processes of fabrication so asto bring them to calm. In detail the pattern is this The factors for awakening are listed in an order where each factor builds on the ones before it mindfulnessanalysis of qualities according to MN  this is the discernment factorequivalent to noble right view persistence rapture calm concentration andequanimity. MN  explains the natural progression from one factor to the nextin this way with mindfulness as a factor of awakening building on any of thefour establishings of mindfulnessMindfulness On whatever occasion the monk remains focused onthe body in amp of itselfardent alert amp mindfulsubduing greed ampdistress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness issteady amp without lapse... Similarly with feelings in amp of themselvesmind in amp of itself and mental qualities in amp of themselves.Analysis of qualities Remaining mindful in this way he examinesanalyzes amp comes to a comprehension of that quality any of thequalities or events present in the process of trying to establishmindfulness with discernment...Persistence In one who examines analyzes amp comes to acomprehension of that quality with discernment persistence is arousedunflaggingly...Rapture In one whose persistence is aroused a rapture not of theflesh arises...Calm For one enraptured at heart the body grows calm and themind grows calm...Concentration For one who is at easehis body calmedthe mindbecomes concentrated...Equanimity He carefully watches the mind thus concentrated withequanimity...The pattern of this progressionbeginning with three factors equivalent toright mindfulness right view and right effortrecalls the description of thenoble eightfold path in MN  in which these three path factors circle aroundthe development of other path factors in leading to right concentration. The onlydifference is that in MN  the discernment factor precedes mindfulnesswhereas here the establishing of mindfulness comes first.This pattern is also related to the three qualities fostered in the establishing ofmindfulness ardency mindfulness and alertness. Starting with the qualities ofmindfulness and alertness used to establish mindfulness in the first factor ofawakening you further develop mindfulness and alertness when you rememberto analyze phenomena as they occur in terms of cause and effect skillful andunskillful SN  in the second factor of awakening. Then in the third factorof awakening you exert persistence which here is equivalent to ardency todevelop the skillful and abandon the unskillful in such a way as to lead first torapture then to calm concentration and equanimity.The inclusion of the factor of analysis of qualities in this process means thatthe first three factors for awakening add the quality of discernment to the threequalities fostered in the establishing of mindfulness. This addition parallels theway in which the sixteen steps implicitly encourage you to develop discernmentand insight by looking for the role of fabrication with regard to body and mindseeing how cause and effect operate in the process of fabricating skillful and unskillful states.,RightMindfulness,cjp8k5v,1,t5_33150
1666728,0,t3_2dgijs,D. MENTAL QUALITIESUnder the topic of the fourth frame of reference DN  lists five sets ofcategories to keep in mind the five hindrances the five clingingaggregates thesixfold sense media the seven factors for awakening and the four noble truths.As we have already noted the four noble truths and their duties form theoverarching framework for understanding how right mindfulness shouldfunction. The remaining sets of categories fall under these truths and the duties appropriate to them. The hindrances as a cause of stress are to be abandoned.The clingingaggregates as the primary example of the truth of stress are to becomprehended to the point of dispassion. As for the sixfold sensemedia thediscussion in DN  focuses on the fetters that arise in dependence on thesemediafetters that as a cause of stress should be abandoned. The seven factorsfor awakening as aspects of the path are to be developed.What this means is that these categories are intended as frameworks to keepin mind to guide your ardency in trying to fulfill the duties of the four nobletruths. DN  gives no indication of when a particular framework might be moreuseful than another but a few observations might be helpful here. The sixfoldsensemedia form the framework for the practice of restraint of the senses. Thefive hindrances and seven factors for awakening are most often treated as guidesfor what to abandon and what to develop when bringing the mind toconcentration. The five clingingaggregates are a useful framework for inducingdispassion in two circumstances when you want to analyze any phenomena thatwould pull you out of concentration into greed and distress with reference to theworld and when you want to develop dispassion for the world of becomingcreated by the concentration itself. The four noble truths provide an overarchingframework for the practice as a whole. As we noted the description of rightmindfulness in MN in which mindfulness circles around the first five factorsof the path to bring about right concentrationwould count as an application ofthis framework. It also illustrates how this framework arches over the others inproviding guidance in how to bring mindfulness to bear on every part of thepath.It would be impossible to list all the ways in which these frameworks can beput to use. The following discussion is meant simply to provide a fewsuggestions for further inquiry.The five hindrances are obstacles to concentration. They are sensual desire illwill sloth amp drowsiness restlessness amp anxiety and uncertainty. The discussionof these hindrances under this fourth frame of reference lists five things to noticewith regard to each hindrance when it is present when it is absent how it ariseshowonce arisenit is abandoned and how there will be no future arising of itonce it has been abandoned. This last point refers to the stage of the practicewhen that particular hindrance is gone for good. If we identify the hindrancessimply as hindrances to concentration this stage would be stream entry in thecase of uncertainty and nonreturn in every other case for nonreturn is thelevel of awakening where concentration is fully mastered AN  Thai .If we identify the hindrances with the deeper and subtler fetters that share theirnames then uncertainty would be overcome with stream entry sensuality and illwill with nonreturn and restlessness with arahantship MN  AN .In either interpretation this framework can be used all the way from thebeginning stages of concentration practice to the transcendent attainments.The formula for each hindrance follows a standard pattern. Here is theformula for sensual desireThere is the case where there being sensual desire present within amonk discerns There is sensual desire present within me. Or therebeing no sensual desire present within he discerns There is no sensualdesire present within me. He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire. And he discerns how there is the abandoningof sensual desire once it has arisen. And he discerns how there is nofurther appearance in the future of sensual desire that has beenabandoned.SN  gives an overall account of how to use appropriate attention tostarve the hindrances.Now what is lack of food for the arising of unarisen sensual desire or forthe growth amp increase of sensual desire once it has arisen? There is thetheme of unattractiveness. To foster appropriate attention to it This is lackof food for the arising of unarisen sensual desire or for the growth ampincrease of sensual desire once it has arisen.And what is lack of food for the arising of unarisen ill will or for thegrowth amp increase of ill will once it has arisen? There is the release of themind through good will compassion empathetic joy or equanimity. Tofoster appropriate attention to that This is lack of food for the arising ofunarisen ill will or for the growth amp increase of ill will once it has arisen.And what is lack of food for the arising of unarisen sloth amp drowsiness orfor the growth amp increase of sloth amp drowsiness once it has arisen? Thereis the potential for effort the potential for exertion the potential forstriving. To foster appropriate attention to them This is lack of food forthe arising of unarisen sloth amp drowsiness or for the growth amp increase ofsloth amp drowsiness once it has arisen.And what is lack of food for the arising of unarisen restlessness amp anxietyor for the growth amp increase of restlessness amp anxiety once it has arisen?There is stillness of awareness. To foster appropriate attention to that Thisis lack of food for the arising of unarisen restlessness amp anxiety or for thegrowth amp increase of restlessness amp anxiety once it has arisen.And what is lack of food for the arising of unarisen uncertainty or for thegrowth amp increase of uncertainty once it has arisen? There are mentalqualities that are skillful amp unskillful blameworthy amp blameless gross amprefined siding with darkness amp with light. To foster appropriate attentionto them This is lack of food for the arising of unarisen uncertainty or forthe growth amp increase of uncertainty once it has arisen.  SN Many discourses give further instructions for bringing appropriate attentionto the potentials that starve specific hindrances. Here are some instructions fordealing with drowsinessOnce the Blessed One was living among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park atBhesaka  Grove near Crocodile Haunt. At that time Ven.MahMoggallna prior to his awakening sat nodding near the village ofKallavlaputta in Magadha. The Blessed One saw this with his purifieddivine eye surpassing the human and as soon as he saw thisjust as astrong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended armdisappeared from the Deer Park... appeared right in front of Ven.MahMoggallna and sat down on a prepared seat. As he was sittingthere the Blessed One said to Ven. MahMoggallna Are you noddingMoggallna? Are you nodding?Yes lord.Well then Moggallna whatever perception you have in mind whendrowsiness descends on you dont attend to that perception dont pursueit. Its possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.But if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then recall toyour awareness the Dhamma as you have heard amp memorized it reexamine it amp ponder it over in your mind....But if by doing this you dont shake off your drowsiness then repeataloud in detail the Dhamma as you have heard amp memorized it. Itspossible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.,RightMindfulness,cjp9434,1,t5_33150
