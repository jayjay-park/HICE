8010927,0,t1_d4ghbyr,Well since you where so good to post your thoughts here are mine dont forget me dammit. I dont think that the  rule is a good one as we are not playing historically otherwise I wouldnt be a major Support of independence should indeed be relative to the country you are trying to get independence from. If you fail your independence war you lose the right to play that nation again I agree with that. But another player should have the right to try it for themselves so for me it doesnt have to remain AI for the remainder of the game.Also you noted nation ruining as a way to get some sort of revenge. I think we should add the rule that if you do that you are banned from playing with us EVER again. We do not tolerate salty people ruining the fun of others.Your thoughts?Edit Spelling my English sucks from time to time,EuropePlaysParadox,d4gi3zq,1,t5_3ewoy
8011039,0,t1_d4gi5g8,What you say is true to a certain degree because as far as I believe you can not rent more troops out to other countries at the same time as your capable of hiring mercs. There is a limit. So in that respect the new rules makes it impossible for an country to send its entire army only a part of it which Im fine with as it is a in game feature.,EuropePlaysParadox,d4gika1,1,t5_3ewoy

8235884,0,t1_d56nvcv,Youre one to talk about primitive nations. Yes the Qing inherited their enlightened state from the treacherous Japanese but that does not matter when each Qing soldier is worth  Bukharan soldiers. Were it not for your strong allies you would not be able to leverage such bold claims over the Qing central state. But if the Sultan were to recognize the rightful rule of Qing over the Northern Chinese lands I would see no reason for the deaths of Bukharan and Qing troops. After all violence is the last refuge of the incompetent and I would hate for either or our rules to be interpreted as incompetent. ,EuropePlaysParadox,d571hca,2,t5_3ewoy

What about splitting up into two teams perhaps three? We could either have a competition between both of them or totally different ones.

10240946,0,t3_5mn4pp,Kazan Songhai represent!Today Jiben and I gloriously lost to Muscovy and switched nations. Songhai is doing quite well expanding at a high rate while staying ahead in tech at least compared to its neighbours. Jiben did all the playing this session while I observed and learned.At the last rehost I subbed for Uzbek because he had to go. That SOB remarkable character backstabbed us suprised us in  which caused to us to be raped by Muscovy had some negative consequences for us. So to repay him I ran his country into the ground hahaha conquered most of Kazan and occupied GH for him. No seriously I did. Congrats to uCrazyblitz for coming out on top in a difficult war at the start of the session.Next session Ill be playing Stronghai and the world will learn of its might. In turn we hope to learn of other player nations as we currently know none.,EuropePlaysParadox,dc4v9qr,8,t5_3ewoy
