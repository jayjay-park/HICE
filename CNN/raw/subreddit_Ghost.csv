1931207,0,t1_ckluwkq,Thanks for the pros and cons.  I really like the simplicity of Ghost but like you said it is lacking in many CMS type features.Had no idea about the necessities built it.  Love it. of what I need would be covered by Ghost i.e. blogging.  The crucial  that might hinder me from using Ghost is building a page from custom post types AND the ability to email forms sans a third party provider.  Otherwise it seems like a perfect fit. I will definitely keep an eye on it.,Ghost,cklw9xb,1,t5_2qyc0
