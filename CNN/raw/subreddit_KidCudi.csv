9095141,0,t3_54sdr4,love SBTH. I understand yet dont understand the hate it receives. I hate when people call it trash it seems like people do not understand the lyricism and the vibes the album gives. I know it isnt exactly a model case of punk rock but thats the point. The album is a reflection of Cudis dark psyche a sick twisted depressing as hell view into his deepest emotions. I honestly thought SBTH was his most emotional album ever. It relates to me on such a high level. I absolutely love it for that reason.and as for WZRD I honestly didnt give it a very thorough listen to give a perspective on it. I have listened to the songs on the album but I havent personally sat down had a good smoked sesh and listened to it. this is how i connect with all of his albums There are definitely a few songs I dig on that album Teleport  Me Where Did You Sleep Last Night which is an awesome cover and I will give it a more thorough listen. I consider myself a huge Cudi fan but felt I have given myself a disservice by not giving WZRD the listen that it deserves. I will download that shit and give it a good listen with the most open mind possible.,KidCudi,d85397d,2,t5_2sex1
9098997,0,t1_d85hmev,If the tunnel visiond with rap struck a cord I certainly didnt mean it to. Obviously it doesnt apply to you if you listen to all sorts of music. But there are certainly those who wont touch it if it isnt hiphoprap which theres nothing wrong with you like what you like. Those are the ones that was directed to. And it sucks that Cudi gets stuck with the stigma that he only makes stoner music which he did to himself I know or that you have to be on drugs to enjoy his music. This is coming from someone who is also in his s but straight edge. I dont suffer from chronic depression or thoughts of suicide but Cudi has definitely helped me through really rough time and so many others with his music. Whether someone is awful or has no talent is completely relative though. Does he have the voice of Pharrell? No. But he can sing. Can he shred a guitar the way Slash can? No. but he can play the guitar. I certainly agree that Cudi is no lyricist but his lyricism does connect with a ton of people. And not every single song of his or any other artist for that matter is going to have next level thought provokingclever lyrics. He said on Pharrells BeatsOne show that he got a lot of feelings from his past hes had out on SBH. Now I am not saying SBH is gods gift to music  it isnt. Im not even saying its my favorite Cudi album. But I do enjoy it. Hes a big fan of Nirvana and Pink Floyd so him trying to make that type of music that he admires isnt necessarily a bad thing. Just CLEARLY isnt for a lot of people. But thank you for explaining in detail what you dislike about those albums and him as well,KidCudi,d85jwdq,6,t5_2sex1
