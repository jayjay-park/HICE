9714237,0,t3_5e22nb,Pictures of the parents would be a good example for you to go by. Multigen doodles tend to keep pretty soft and curly fur but it will lighten in color over the course of the first  years. That one might end as a grey pup but seeing its parents would tell you more. The puppy coat will be a little softer but even the adult coat is very soft compared with other dogs and I havent noticed any difference in the curls of my little fluffball between his puppy and adult coat.,labradoodles,daahnjy,1,t5_2rqa0
