Of course the two micro breweries in the area is another plus. hahaha.

6544122,0,t3_453mwx,A few assorted thoughts on last nights game Khudobin started slow first goal was  on him but after looking shaky early almost singlehandedly kept us in the game. His frustration towards the end of the game was entirely justified he got hung out to dry repeatedly and shouldnt be facing  shotsgame. Credit to the Gulls for coming out strong in the second period. They looked flatter than a Nebraska highway in the first and after the second Bakersfield goal I thought the game was over and we were in for a drubbing. I wish they could put together  minutes of strong hockey its been a long time since theyve played three great periods at least at home. Theodore is still off his game and the third goal was largely on him as he got completely walked around. He had some fancy stickwork and flashes of brilliance at times but he has yet to get back to top form. It has to be tough to be a  year old and deal with the demotion after spending a month with the Ducks but his time in the NHL will come. The Gulls have an almost comical ability to make a series of fancy movespasses that dont result in a shot on goal. Im not an advocate of taking garbage shots just for the sake of it but when you get breakaways and odd man rushes that dont result in shots on goal youre doing something fundamentally wrong. Someone needs to step into Fribergs role and be a twoway spark plug. Bonis has stepped up and is grinding it out but he hasnt had the same impact Friberg had. Obviously were at the mercy of the Ducks as it pertains to personnel but the Friberg for Tokarski trade looks worse and worse as time goes on. Hopefully they end up making a big trade with Andersen before the deadline to justify it otherwise it will look exponentially worse.,SanDiegoGulls,czw7rhu,5,t5_369ze

But shit for how much we usually leave him hanging and he saves us he can have an off game.Other than that from what I saw the team that decided the game was the zebras. Ill see if Kodi has the game archived later tomorrow and pull some video that was some bullshit.
