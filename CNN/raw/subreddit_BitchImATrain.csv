9157228,0,t1_d8cpc21,we all realize that trains can go in either direction and that the word reverse is completely relative when referring to trains. it doesnt make the usage of the word reverse incorrect in this context but it does make you look like youre just trying to pick apart any other possible meaning of a word.Oh and by the way that pullman car at the front there is NOT an engine and so this train by any reasonable persons assessment actually did reverse its way into the station. Here is a video of it in motion on the way to the station earlier that day.,BitchImATrain,d8cqub7,2,t5_2wlut
