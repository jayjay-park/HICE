255936,0,t1_cf6rq9f,I have read various theories about this. I dont know that I necessarily agree with the theories but there are enough inconsistencies in the official suicide narrative that Im curious about a what if scenario. The theory I found most credible came from the author of The Rat Line blanking on his name right now and suggested an escape to Southeast Asia not Argentina. ,wanttobelieve,cf7a7nh,3,t5_2yjjs

1206455,0,t1_ci5ahye,No worries have any ideas on what it could be?  Trying to see how they could not be sky lanterns.  When they disappear they could be going through clouds and the formation could be formed from wind carrying them together at the same height but with some ahead and some behind from a depth perspective at least from the cameras perspective from different angles they arent so organized.  I think a formation of extraterrestrial object would be almost perfect instead of a few slightly out of sequence.  But I hope you can debunk my theory in all honesty.,wanttobelieve,ci5ceyc,1,t5_2yjjs
