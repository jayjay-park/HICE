7674127,0,t1_d3ehl4o,Thats awesome to hear! I agree their debut album was amazing! Do you like their change in sound? I really like it and it makes me excited for their nd album which is being made at the moment! I hope we get a release this year. Also another great thing about TRC is how they reply to fans messages. Have you ever spoke to them online or seen them live?,theroyalconcept,d3ei4a6,1,t5_2zfc9
