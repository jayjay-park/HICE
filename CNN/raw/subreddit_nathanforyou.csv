5399500,1,t1_cw1sf0w,He is bombing too honestly. None of the current late night hosts are doing it right now. Conan has sort of lost the magic on TBS. Jimmy Fallon who is a cool dude is not really too funny. Colbert is lost right now the show is only in its infancy but he seems to be sticking to the formula more than lateryears Letterman even  not to mention the awful band. Reggie Watts should either be hosting The Late Late Show or the bandleader on Colbert. And Late Night with Seth Meyers is actually unwatchable. Like...I cannot sit through an episode. It is a BAD  minute Weekend Update plus celebrities plugging their stuff. Honestly the  lineup on Comedy Central should just be nightly shows hosted by H. Jon Benjamin and Nathan in the spirit of Has a VanNathan for You meets early s Daily Show and peakColbert more comedy than politics. Those would be shows that I would watch every night.,nathanforyou,cw1ugdr,-2,t5_2wi4j
