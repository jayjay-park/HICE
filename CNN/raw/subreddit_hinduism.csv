43820,0,t3_1qbjzw,This is quite a nonsense. All it takes to be a good Hinduhuman is good heart and restraint from evil deeds. A good and pious person can very well be an atheist and still have a happy lifeafterlife. The funny but sad irony is that lot of people who are devout with enough time and money for the God are usually the ones with an evil heartmind or with something corrupt in their pasts. It is difficult to reach out to god and not ask anything. If you can do that and can in general maintain good conduct you are better than most of practising Hindus.,hinduism,cejf4zn,2,t5_2qifc

848401,0,t1_ch0lce2,This was a fascinating comment thread. Glad you guys could hash it out.A Hindu has come to mean anything nowadays but followers of Sanatana Dharma believe in the divinity of the vedas. Vedas are not some words written by warring tribes they are divine revelation.If someone translates them as poetry about warring tribes their translation is not useful. There is a tradition of gurushishya parampara one must receive knowledge in a disciplic succession. If scholarship Indian or western is outside that it may appear attractive but it is not useful.But I can appreciate your points that many modern scholars may not fit in the category of being in a particular school they may not have taken formal initiation but are respectful. That is the important thing they must be respectful to the acharyas. And there is nothing wrong with trying to be objective and saying The vedas claim divinity but what IS WRONG is apriori dismissing the Vedic claim of divine revelation because it is unscientific or unscholarly. And then fitting all other scholarship around denying divinity because divinity itself is unscientific. So it is really a much larger problem of God not being allowed into science. That is why they have stuck to BCE instead of using common sense and accepting that Mohenjodaro settlements are vedic.I suppose Christians have been dealing with this for a long time with writings on the Bible but they do not have a formal guru shisha parampara which is still active for followers of the Vedas.,hinduism,ch0pu0p,3,t5_2qifc

I am only explaining how that position is advaitamayavada which you have yet to grasp.I cant help your confusion if you dont know the difference between brahman and prakriti.Again you think accepting scripture is fideism. Your efforts to mix easternwestern thought are cute but misguided. All discussion in vedic circles was done with scripture as shabda pramana. As I mentioned before try to decide your position and basis. You want to discuss vedic concepts without understanding their basis or context.If you dont accept vedic scripture then there is no point in discussion. Discussing vedanta as armchair speculation has no attraction for me. You will simply throw around vedic terms which you prefer and ignore the context and tradition.visitadvaita dvaita and achintyabhedabheda are all against advaita I am providing relevant examples for you but I can see they are of no use. I dont want to waste my time with someone who ignores the concepts of apauresheyic shabda pramana which was accepted by even advaitic schools again the contribution of Shankaracharya. So your confusion manifests itself by your rejection of apauresheyic authority on matters of brahman which is the jurisdiction of shabda pramana. So you are showing why buddhists did not comment on brahman their discussions tried to disprove brahman. When it was proven by logic that brahman should exist then there is vedantic discussion on the nature of brahman which by its definition is beyond the mind and senses. Your throwing of a few vedic terms around without understanding the basic paradigm is quite disappointing.,hinduism,cicgclo,1,t5_2qifc

1523400,0,t3_2bntzi,Your reaction mirrors the reaction of the first colonial missionaries who showed up in India to convert us demon worshippers. The idea is simple a proper vision of God must be all encompassing. It must not shunt out God and make Her benign. This inherently limits ones approach and creates friction whenever one encounters another religious tradition. Because your idea of God is limited due to your upbringing on Jesus you cannot understand how God can be seen in this way. Youre used probably to associate blood etc with demons beings who are antithetical to God.Over here thats not the case. A spiritual maturity which most people dont have Im not blaming you means that all aspects both benign and fierce must be accepted and worshipped as such.Sri Aurobindo puts it much better than I ever can when he says gt  Wegt must look existence in the face if our aim is to arrive at a rightgt solution whatever that solution may be.

2300547,0,t1_clw13x1,gt Can a Hindu today have a valid realization that contradicts a Seers realization?In fact Buddha did precisely this  he flat out contradicted most of the received wisdom of those days. Not only that  Hinduism itself has different schools of philosophies that are sometimes in direct opposition to each other even as they assert the validity of the same set of foundational texts!I think we have to think a bit carefully about the nature of realization of the Absolute and the implication of trying to distill the experience into a human language through concepts that originate from our everyday mundane experiences of the world. Almost everyone states that this is a futile exercise  Absolute Truth cannot be thus distilled. And yet as a practical matter the seers must do so. But they are hardly superhumans with some godly gift of transmitting this realization in all its fidelity to others. So the different seers describe the same experience differently and inevitably imperfectly based on their social conditioning and intellectual and linguistic capacities. This is why I think Hinduism as a culture is not so gungho on the doctrines we should believe but emphasizes practices that will take us directly to realization of the Truth. Descriptions are pointless  the only thing to do is to realize the Truth for yourself. To one who has realized the Truth the scriptures are as useless as a well is when the entire countryside is flooded. To one who hasnt all the belief in the world in some particular doctrine does no good at all.,hinduism,clw2bdo,5,t5_2qifc

During the Lanka war Once Sri Rama and Laksmana were bound by nagapasa snakeropes. They had fallen unconscious and were about to die. By the instruction of Narada Rsi Hanuman brought Garuda from Vaikuntha. When Garuda arrived just by smelling the scent of his body all the snakes fled. Garuda then had a doubt. He thought Who is this person? Can it be Rama the Supreme Personality of Godhead? No this person can never be Rama. Im the servant of Lord Rama. By the mere glance of Rama those snakes would have all left immediately. They would not be able to even come to Rama yet they were binding this person. When I came by my influence they quickly gave up this person. So who is He?Garuda went to his Gurudeva Sankara but his Gurudeva told him I have no time Im going just now. You should go to Kakabhusundi. You are the king of birds so you should go to the most wretched among all birds  a crow.

Steven Pinker is the Richard Dawkins of linguistics. Good only in linguisticsbut shit everywhere else. Even thenI am quoting RadhakrishnanI recall uArjun s post on thisgtThe doctrine of rebirth enunciated in the Upanishads sometimes in the extravagant form led to the idea that all things in the world possessed souls. Naturally the jaina believed that every material thing fire wind and plant also had a spirit in it. On such a view the simple joy of the earlier peoples in sacrifices could not last. the times were ripe for revolt. the belief that all things animals and insects plants and leaves were possessed of souls when coupled with the idea of rebirth led to a horror of taking life in any form.Then a part of the article where he does nothing but put anecdotal evidence.He is right about one thingHindus do not have the arms to write and defend themselvesand he demonstrates it himself amplyits hilariouslysadly ironic. As ushannondoah said in another commentthey will have to adopt the Jain methodLD Institute of Indology to defend themselves.And at the bestthey look like conspiratorial lunatics about missionariesbut at the same timedisplay complete fucking apathy for their own flock.They are the victims of their own sins.

The scriptures are their vani by which we can have their association. Srila Prabhupada even said that if you dont study the books of the acharyas you will fall down. We cant just wave them away as this would be a huge disrespect to them.gtWhats the point of talking scripture and logic anyway if they reject the most basic premise of Vedic knowledge  one must learn from a guru?I dont know whether RKDBji has disobeyed his gurudeva or not I am not in the position to make this judgement only Nitai knows but whatever it is let us not jump to conclusion too early.gtThere are no healthy branches of Gaudiya tree left outside of ISKCONI humbly disagree here. My Gurudeva is not part of ISKCON but Gaudiya Math and to me he is pure. There are alot of foundations outside of ISKCON which hold true to the mission of VinodaSaraswati. They are all trying to follow the words of their acharayas. I cannot condone such a general criticism of pure Vaishnavs. My Guru Maharaja for instance left ISKCON because they would not give him sannayasa the GBC had set an official sannayasa minimum age when our acharyas say that as soon as one is sufficiently detached one can take Sannayasa at any age.gtGM for example has been totally overrun by exISKCON westerners who poisoned the minds of remaining disciples of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati and their Indian followers.How so? Many of the Gaudiya Maths still remaining a headed by personalities that were never in ISKCON in the first place. ISKCON is an institution like any other and if one finds a sadhu outside of ISKCON one must go and surrender unto them. gtThis RKDB person thinks he is in fact he awarded himself a title already. Well he maybe is we dont know this. Only a madhyama adhikari has the power to see who is a Vaishnav and who is not. I dont know about you but I am lower than a kanistha so I have no spiritual strength to discriminate between who is Sadhu and who is not. So best to stay humble and respect. Even when Vallabhacharya corrected Rupa Goswami incorrectly Rupa Goswami did not speak up he stayed humble and strongly rebuked Jiva Goswami when he later corrected Vallabhacarya. As for his photo it is a nice photo. Maybe it is for preaching purposes? Though I disagree it is this sectarianism that is giving Gaudiya Vaishnavism a bad name. Let us unite all as the sons and daughters of Lord Gaur Nitai.

The word itself is used in different ways sometimes it is used to refer to the groups sometimes it refers to country as a whole.Anyway if you visit a village and look at these groups there are couple of different ways in which they can be characterized.  First some groups are  characterized by occupations like weaver carpenter shepherds fisherman shopkeepers and so on. The groups partially retain their identity as groups even after most people have left their older professions due to modernization. There are groups based on following a particular tradition or a saint. Muslims and Christians were perceived as another jati with their own customs as there is no strong native concept of a religion and also their are many jatis within them.  Then there are groups based on migrations of people from one part of the country to another who then form one community. Sometimes this happens due to a new kingdom and a certain people gain power and a new group emerges. Many jatis are relatively recent while some are quite old.

7272886,0,t1_d23y2p8,Moksa is still freedom from samsara on this view. Its beyond the material world so there is no changing of physical bodies. Mahaprabhus teaching is called acintyabhedaabheda inconceivably the same and different. Its not based solely on Bhagavatam but Bhagavatam is considered the topmost pramana. When they say topmost in this way this doesnt mean it contains every piece of information but that it gives us the ultimate understanding of Brahman  namely love of God and so the stories of Gods pastimes are given there and also the th Canto with pastimes of Krishna are considered topmost achievement for the jiva.As far as I know Gaudiyas are unique in giving Bhagavatam this sort of status but this doesnt mean other scriptures are rejected. Its still Vedanta so is based on the Upanishads Brahma Sutra Gita etc. All these texts are open to interpretation so the different schools of Vedanta are the different interpretations or exegesis of the texts. Different schools also give different priority to certain texts. Im not sure if any Vedic texts say anything explicitly in the sense of literally. The knowledge we can gain from scripture depends on the level of our realisation and thus our understanding.This view of impersonal Brahman as the effulgence of God is also unique to Gaudiyas. Im not that well informed about these subjects but Ive heard it said that Gaudiya Vaishnava ontology presents a synthesis of the other schools. Sri Madhvas Dvaita and Sri Ramanujas Vishishtadvaita dont incorporate the Advaitin idea of undifferentiated Brahman whereas Gaudiyas include this as one aspect of God namely his effulgence.So when people speak of moksha these different ideas of what Brahman is will affect their corresponding ideas of what moksha is. ,hinduism,d24vmr7,1,t5_2qifc

7425638,0,t1_d29i7os,I seem to have missed this thread but interesting post. Im not sure about your background and how wellversed you are with ISKCON practices but your statementgtIts daft to think spending your entire life repeating the same words over and over will force you to think of God right before death... seems in ignorance. The purpose of chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra in addition to being prescribed by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is so that we are connected to Krishna by his names. Since we believe Krishna to be nondifferent than his names we believe that Krishna is with us when we chant. Thus when we are chanting we are calling out to Krishna and Krishna is with us.  Krishna says in the BG  .. only quoting translationsgtI am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.gtThe thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me their lives are surrendered to Me and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and conversing about Me.gtTo those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.gtOut of compassion for them I dwelling in their hearts destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.These four verses summarize perfectly why ISKCON chants the Mahamantra. We as ignorant living entities seek shelter of Krishna to find out how HE wants us to come to him. By chanting the names of Krishna we try to focus our thoughts on Krishnas names alone. When we arent chanting we try to connect Krishna to parts of our lives. This is easier if you have a temple at home or a temple nearby where you can do some seva. gtIt takes the purpose of Universal Love out of the picture and replaces it with robotic fearNo this is incorrect. Im guessing you see ISKCON Hare Krishna chanting as something constant and focused sort of like a sadhu chanting OM. From what Ive read and heard the longer you chant including factors such as number of years dedication to chanting purpose of chanting the taste of chanting that you get becomes very different. You fall in love with the names of Krishna and you yearn to constantly chant his names because you experience that supreme bliss in your heart. Loving Krishnas names and loving Krishna is the same thing since they are nondifferent. I leave you with two of my favorite verses from the Sri Sikshastakam by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhugt Text gt nayanam galadashrudharayagt vadanam gadgadaruddhaya giragt pulakair nichitam vapuh kadagt tava namagrahane bhavishyatigt gt O my Lord when will my eyes be decorated with tears of love flowing constantly when I chant Your holy name? When will my voice choke up and when will the hairs of my body stand on end at the recitation of Your name?gt gt gt Text gt yugayitam nimeshenagt chakshusha pravrishayitamgt shunyayitam jagat sarvamgt govindavirahena megt gt O Govinda! Feeling Your separation I am considering a moment to be like twelve years or more. Tears are flowing from my eyes like torrents of rain and I am feeling all vacant in the world in Your absence.gt There are a multitude of ways to express love especially to God. There is no single way to loving God its all about the individual feelings. To quote the statement that started this replygtIts daft to think spending your entire life repeating the same words over and over will force you to think of God right before deathNo. No one knows when death will come. There is always a chance that you will not remember God before you die regardless of how spiritually elevated you are. Chanting mindlessly isnt going to help you remember God at the time of death no matter what mantra you chant. But if you develop an attachment to chanting because you want to chant because it connects you to God because it intensifies the affection you have for God there is a higher probability that you will remember God at the time of death but when youve grown that much  life and death isnt of much concern anymore is it?,hinduism,d2m8wi6,1,t5_2qifc

Not O.N.E. The other point is that in Hinduism the physical universe is created by Shiva Ishvara Umapati Rudra etc.. Because he is the Presiding Lord Abhimani Devata over the  fundamental elements paMcha bhUtas space fire temperature air gas water liquidand dirt solid. Saying that what he created is a delusionsimulation is a direct insult to him. It is equivalent to attributing a fault to him. The funny thing is that Shaivaites are the one that are propagating the philosophy of the unreality of the world mayavada. All  major branches of vaishnavism gaudiya vishishtadvaita and tattvavada subscribe to the reality of the world. In fact I would go so far as to venture that there is no vaishnavite philosophy in which the world is unreal.Which means one of  things. The entity that they pray to as God Shiva  is incapable of creating the physical universe  is also deluded in thinking that he is not Brahman like the followers or  is cheating. The other possibility is that Shiva is a delusion too i.e. part of the simulation. In which case praying to him is stupid.None of which are acceptable to me which is the reason I believe in the reality of the universe. Just because it is composed of  pieces of energy doesnt mean that it is unreal.Dreams which are just the random firing of neurons in the brain are still real. The things we see in the dream might not exist in the physical world like a pink elephant. But pinkness and elephantness itself exist.If dreams themselves are unreal then the dream shouldnt exist!

Caste as a problem in Christianity is so bad that some are converting to Judaism to escape untouchability in Christianity although Judaism itself isnt anticaste.See this paperTelugu Jews Are the Dalits of coastal Andhra going casteawry?Paper by Dr. Yulia Egorova of Durham Universitygt Like Kancha Ilaiah Shmuel Yacobi explicitly dissociates Dalit culture from Hinduism but he also distances it from Christianity with its Universalist message which did not help his ancestors to escape the stigma of untouchability. Instead he offers his Madiga followers a religion that has its own tradition of applying different laws of ritual purity to different categories of persons. To return to the ethnographic context of the communitys life in the village insisting on eating kosher provides the Bene Ephraim with a mechanism to separate their congregants ritually from the Christian Madiga and ensures that their neighbours are more likely to become aware of their Jewishness. We could sometimes observe Bene Ephraim refusing to eat in the houses of other villagers on the grounds that the food prepared in their homes was not kosher. Just like caste Hindus refuse food prepared by the Madiga the Bene Ephraim now have dietary prohibitions of their own to which they subject their nonJewish neighbours. These Judaism converts even have their own origin story. At the end of the day conversion is being used to distance from practices of followers of other religions. ,hinduism,d62nsdb,1,t5_2qifc

9409366,0,t3_59cagz,In order to know more about Sai Baba you need to first understand the concept of the incarnation of God.An incarnation of God is a form taken up by the unimaginable God. God in His absolute state cannot be perceived by any soul. All souls belong to the phase of relative reality. In order to make Himself known to His devotees and to also derive greater entertainment from His creation the absolute God merges with a specific form such a form is known as an incarnation of God. God appears in energetic forms as well as human forms.People generally like worshiping the energetic forms of God. But the thing is these forms are not relevant to the world we live in. The energetic forms such as Lord Vishnu Lord Shiva etc. exist only for souls living in the upper worlds. In this world we have human incarnations of God or avatars. The avatars can be perceived only by extremely rare devotees who have conquered their inherent ego and jealousy.Sai Baba was one such avatar. He was a Satguru as compared to any other realized preacher who is known simply as a Guru. All human incarnations can also be considered as realized souls. All realized souls however are not human incarnations.The world today is filled with frauds who consider themselves to be human incarnations of God. Its important to filter out the true ones from the false. Contrary to popular belief God appears as an avatar in each generation of humanity in multiple places at the same time. Such a feat is possible only for the omnipotent God.For example Sai Baba Swami Samartha and Ramakrishna Paramahansa were all human incarnations who simultaneously belonged to the same time period.

You can use neutral terms like Scripture Belief Canon nonAbrahamic etc.AlsoZeus Pater corresponds to Dyaus Pitra which later corresponded with Jupiter. Also Taara corresponds to Oestera.

10022666,0,t1_dbbd659,Maybe...but I feel like thats stretching it. The horse sacrifice is attested to in many ancient texts of India. It was a royal ritual that signified the power of King. First the horse itself is a symbol of royalty prestige and military power. The horse was set free to roam as it pleased accompanied by a war band. If the horse wandered into another kings territory the other king would have the right to attack the war band. As such the horse sacrifice could result in wars with neighboring kingdoms. If the horse was not captured by the end of the year it would be sacrificed and the sacrificing kings prestige would increase significantly. The horse sacrifice was significant and had a lot of prestige attached to it since only a confident and powerful king would attempt one. The king had to be ready to go to war with any of his neighbors. This represented a risk since it could create new enemies threaten alliances and possibly result in a loss of territory if you lost a battle. So a king would only attempt a horse sacrifice if he was very confident in his military or he had already conquered vast enough territory that the horse was unlikely to wander into many other kingdoms.In conclusion the horse sacrifice signified great power in the ancient times. When the Pandvas did a horse sacrifice it was a message Were here and were powerful! Mess with us at your own risk!,hinduism,dbdzc1u,2,t5_2qifc

10124319,0,t3_5kwpna,Sat Dharma can you explain this? As far as my understanding goes Sat can mean goodtruth. Dharma can mean waylifenatureDepending on context.So the word can be used as good way  true way. So what is this true way why is it the true way and how can it be the true way?Lots of people disagree with eternal service because we are not the servants of God. Human life is not to serve God but to understand him. When I surrender myself to God it is not for enslavement but for enlightenment. So that I can understand his true form. Not the form where he plays the flute so as to keep the world entertained but the form upon seeing which Arjuna got panicked and begs him to tone down and revert back to his materialistic form. Do Not think Sri Krishna is the ultimate form of  Sri Maha Vishnu Sri Rama or any form of him. The ultimate form is something that many do crores of years of Tapasya to get a glimpse of. The form upon seeing which our Karma is burnt with the fires of knowledge that is the form I seek.When this Universe cease to exist as we know now everything including all the avatars of Sri Maha Vishnu will be destroyed along with it. And in the next form of Universe Sri Maha Vishnu will be taking forms depending upon the then conditions.  And what are these lesser Gods you are speaking of? As far as I know there are only Gods.Sanatana Dharma can also mean something that has been followed through the agesSomething that does not have a set start . It means that what my parents have followed what my ancestors have followed.What I am set to follow. So someone who is born in a christian  muslim any religious family and who lives his life in that belief system is said to be following his Dharma. And since it is being followed from generations it can be called Sanatana Dharma. There is nothing wrong in it and is completely acceptable. There is not one single way to approach the true form of God.But someone who converts their religion doesnt have the necessary base to call themselves living in Sanatana Dharma. They are new to this. Just because one fine day you thought of becoming a Hindu and write next to your religion the word Hindu on a piece of paper doesnt make you one. First live your life with a particular belief system. When you die and people take you to cremate bury they will tell you who you are. If they say he lived his entire life in respect to what his belief system says and that belief system is derived from how Hinduism prescribes you to live only then you get to call yourself Hindu. Until then it is just a word you add in the religion column.Everyone has a way of approaching God. But there only nine ways approved by vedas. Just because  Someone claims to be of the top most authority it doesnt mean that is ultimate way. This isnt a race to see who comes on top.Hindu deities culture do not originate from Manus Prajapatis. ManusPrajapatis are posts given in accordance to promote what needs  to be followed. They are the effective guardians who promote which form of approach is suitable in what condition. Hindu deities culture is set to be followed by Vedas. What gives vedas that power? The answer is simple Vedas are not just scripts written by Sages. Vedas are not bound to What God says preaches. The God is bound to them. Whatever is in Vedas God has to follow them. That is what gives them the authority. It doesnt matter which age in what context we read them the meaning and its direction never changes. That is why we call Sanatana Dharma. The eternal truth.,hinduism,dbr7eaa,3,t5_2qifc
10139402,0,t3_5l5ja6,Long before the British came certain groups were outcast thousands of years ago in fact. For instance people who dealt with dead bodies were considered unlucky and people avoided contact with them.When people say that there was not a system they mean that thousands of ethnic groups were attempted fit into a  fourfold varnas and this is what has been challenged as false by lot of scholarship. No the British didnt create it they just created a discourse around it using older texts. But that doesnt mean the system exists even today ie if you go to a village and ask people to name the varnas it simply doesnt exist on the ground except as adhoc classifications which people give. When majority of kings come from groups considered backward  then the model simply breaks down.The British  in fact  themselves realized this as they were doing the census in the th centurygt As per the new norms the varna model was put through the empirical test and rejected. Society was populated not only with brahmins kshatriyas vaishyas and shudras. Simultaneously the questioning of the credibility of the propagator of this model  Manu  started. Let me cite here some of the officers associated with the census of different provinces in . Referring to the Code of Menu and some of the Puranas that profess to give an account of the institution of castes Cornish who supervised operations in the Madras Presidency commented It is plain that in a critical inquiry regarding the origin of caste we can place no reliance upon the statements made in the Hindu sacred writings. Whether there was ever a period in which the Hindus were composed of four classes is exceedingly doubtful. Similarly C F Magrath the officer entrusted with the compilation of castes from Bihar stated it was necessary if the classification was to be of any use that the now meaningless division into the four castes alleged to have been made by Manu should be put aside The quote comes as a reference in this paper,hinduism,dbt62q1,4,t5_2qifc

10782661,0,t1_ddrtjzi,The cardinalordinal distinction was an example of a confusionI wont go into why and not related to the other confusion of meter.You can define the meter however you likeits a social convention which was different in the past that is irrelevant to the magnitude of speed of light which is finite and has a fixed ratio relative to other speeds like speed of sound or say speed of earth relative to sun.I am replying to these characterizations of Quantum Theory Relativity which are wrong not about what Gita is saying.BTW Spin color of quark are ordinary language words used with a technical meaning it just indicates the values of an abstract state spin refers to the quantized version of angular momentum classically angular momentum of a top is seen in it spinning. Just like a king in chess just refers to an abstraction a certain style of moving rules like being in check and so on. Quantum states evolve continously with time. One superpostition evolves continously into a different superpositionwith different weights assigned to the basis states changing with time continously. There is no sudden shift to another state. What you are referring to is probably the effect of measurement when the state vector collapses to a single state from a superposition of states.Some interpretations like Many Worlds dont accept this collapse of state. Another possibility comes from entangled particles far apart where the effect happens immediately even across great distances which I talked about in previous comment.In general it would help to be accurate about what current theories claim where the new theory is deviating from old theories and evidence for these new claims. For this it is useful to read from a textbook or some popularization which is careful about details unfortunately there are few of these.,hinduism,dds5in0,1,t5_2qifc

Advantages include having a ready supply of skilled workers skilled in various trades social stability due to having limited social mobility and reinforcing the authority of leaders to name a few. The question is do the ends justify the means? And even are these advantages really even advantages in the modern economic and political systems?gtLet me ask you this how could this completely immoral system survive for more than  years? This would mean that Indian culture itself is fundamentally immoral no?Many immoral practices lasted for thousands of years across societies. Survival of a practice does not speak to its morality. For example in almost all societies until the last  years women had virtually no rights. Discriminatory practices against women survived for thousands of years still survive today but you dont see people arguing that they were moral due to that.gtThis would mean that Indian culture itself is fundamentally immoral no?This means that a part of Indian culture is fundamentally immoral just like in most cultures there are practices that are immoral. You shouldnt justify an immoral practice in your culture because it makes you feel butthurt about your identity. Instead you should change the immoral part of your culture so that you can hold your head up high.Also dont assume that criticisms of the caste system are external criticisms being stuffed down the Indians throats. Criticism of it has existed in India since ancient times and so have butthurt people who refuse to acknowledge those criticisms and instead choose to perpetuate a system that benefits them. ,hinduism,dfgt412,2,t5_2qifc

11344648,0,t3_61uusn,Welcome. Learn and practice dharma spread knowledge of dharma amongst your people. is my opinion about Hindus of any race. I believe that Hinduism is a missionary religion and it is duty of every Hindu to spread knowledge of dharma as much as they can especially knowledge of law of karma. Human birth is rare and precious it is wrong for us to stay detached in false sense of racial exclusivity while people destroy their future because they are unaware of dharma which is basis of reality of all. It is also terribly wrong for bharatiyas to deny those nonbharatiyas who have become aware of samsara and want to take refuge in Gods for help in enduringnavigatingescaping samsara. It is not about spreading some label or increasing some community. This of course does not mean any ancient tradition in any temple in India needs to be changed. India has had some dalit bhakti saints who united with God without entering any temple created for savarnas. New temples of course are free to create their own tradition of being open to all races. Mahabharata describes there being temples in Chandala village when Vishwamitra went there in search of food during a famine. I think temple makers and those who do prana pratishtha can choose to create temples open to all. ,hinduism,dfhw9gm,5,t5_2qifc
