4677375,1,t1_ctjutdh,There are many different anarchistic ideologies and most of them are encouraged. Songs that specifically promote libertarian socialism are allowed but not encouraged. This does not mean that songs written or performed by libertarian socialists are not encouraged. The rules should only apply to songs not artists.Honestly I should have left that sentence out of the post as it doesnt really mean anything.,Socialistmusic,ctk4ra0,-3,t5_2wr00
5276343,0,t1_cvm20ec,First this song specifically alludes to passages by Hannes Wader and Brecht which is why I chose to post it here. To quote Krupse gt My heart beats on the left two three four. Its simple. If you want to put us in a political category were on the left side and thats the reason we made the song.As for Laut gegan nazis I believe they chose not to and I could be wrong but because their label which was independent was being bought up by Universal which also funded this concert. It was a contentious time and they were against the move. This was more about saying fuck you to Universal than to give their stamp to Nazis. Its also pretty funny that huge capitalist ventures were the ones who funded this concert.,Socialistmusic,cvm42kw,1,t5_2wr00

11548269,0,t1_dftb1p8,Thanks! This was a great post explaining the song!  In my opinion what this subreddit should be for! I will try to find a subtitled version of this movie. I found a torrent that says the spoken language is french doesnt sound right but the french do like to dub a lot of movies.And besides all that its just an inredibly beautiful song regardless of the language it is in.Edit its gonna take a long time to download so if this is legit i will upload it to youtube and any other place people reccomend.,Socialistmusic,dg4zz1q,1,t5_2wr00
