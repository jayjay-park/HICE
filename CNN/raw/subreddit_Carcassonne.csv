6587325,0,t1_d00oi9v,Ive found rules that said you can play the Phantom on its own if you wanted.gtThe rules for playing this expansion are as follows   Each player gets the phantom of its color.   In the course of the game a player may place this phantom as a second follower on the board.   In this way he may place two followers on two different features on the same game tile.   When a player gets back the phantom he may use it in a later turn as well.   The phantom can also be used alone and always counts as a regular follower. That comes from the listing on ebay for it that I bought it from.However I just noticed the last line always counts as a regular follower so yea I guess you cant call back the Abbot on a turn you play the Phantom.Its awkward retrofitting an expansion with another expansion that were never really intended to be used together.This Sunday should be... interesting. The Abbot the Phantom CathedralsInnsBig Meeples TradePigsBuilders all used for the first time on a group of people who have only played the game for the first time yesterday and only at the last game game  did we try the River. Going to be a wild ride. It all seems fairly straight forward and easy to explain though.,Carcassonne,d00ols1,1,t5_2ssef

Consider he knows how to play like a smart person.  maybe opponent is getting alot of city tiles that game. you need a strat against that. in this case taking the farm might be your way to victory. not every win results in taking the farm though.........How can i close down on your possibilities while opening up and benefiting my own with each tile? If you can benefit from his tiles then you have an advantage.  every tile serves NUMEROUS purposes as the game develops. how are the spaces   spots away going to shape my meeple placements and point outcome? It boils down to possibilities of getting each tile keep track of this having control of outcomes and being unpredictable. ,Carcassonne,dgffwb1,1,t5_2ssef
