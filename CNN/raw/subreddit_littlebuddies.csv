5139224,0,t3_3ldpir,I recommend getting a different living condition for your hamster!  Those types of cages typical coloful full of tubs plastic modular are . of the time way too small even when connected.  For a dwarf hamster Im assuming Campbells Russian over Winter White or probably hybrid. a  gallon would be fine but larger would be better! Since I saw you are a high school student I would highly highly recommend using a DIYbin cage like these A hamster needs a minimum sized living space of in or x aka a  gallon aquarium,littlebuddies,cv5gw0o,1,t5_397gd

7203601,0,t1_d1w01yh,I have three birds but he pigeons arent as dependent on toys as the parrots are. The number of toys I need per month depends on the type. My parrot is small  so it takes her a while to destroy toys. I probably only need a few toys a month to keep her happy because I can rotate through them several times before I have to throw them away. I think once a month would be fine as far as deliveries are concerned. Id love a free sample for my bird! Anything is fine really. ,littlebuddies,d1wzq1j,3,t5_397gd

7959161,0,t1_d4aepqh,That didnt even cross my mind. At first I just assumed you could hide them and get away with it but I totally forgot about the veterinarian aspect. I havent had to take my rats in yet but just knowing I can is comforting. Poor Alberta ratties ,littlebuddies,d4aontu,1,t5_397gd
8299718,0,t1_d5eyqi3,Super easy. Care takes three mins a day with food water and misting and less than ten per week to change out paper towel substrate. A bit more expensive with upfront costs though. I had to get him a terrarium that looks like this and the food is  dollars but it lasts a long time. Not to mention getting one from a reputable breeder can be a bit pricy depending on the morph.,littlebuddies,d5f0ts7,1,t5_397gd

9992199,0,t1_db9xbx9,Thats absolutely brilliant well done! Just one thing  is there tape on the inside? You might find that making some holes in the plastic and using nuts and bolts or cable ties one on each corner will secure the mesh more firmly  thats what I did for mine. It will also mean the hamsters cant ingest the tape. For now that is perfect though! Have you been able to make them one each? Thank you so much for taking our advice. You will have much happier hamsters because of this! What have you called them? ,littlebuddies,dba0fah,2,t5_397gd
