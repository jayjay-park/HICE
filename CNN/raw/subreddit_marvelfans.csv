7506153,0,t3_4i2ice,I saw it! I need to see it again.I loved it. I dont think its going to top TWS for me but it will probably settle in at  or  in the MCU either right in front of or right behind The Avengers.I have to say that it did come off more Avengers . than Captain America  to me which wasnt entirely a bad thing. There were so many great character moments for everyone and as someone who loves character moments even more than action sequences I was happy as a clam about that.Like the rest of the planet I especially loved TChalla and am now super excited about the Black Panther film. I think you could make a pretty strong argument that TChalla was the actual hero of the film since he got the arc with the strongest emotional climax and resolution and the most character growth.More surprisingly I also liked SpiderMan a lot. Ive always been pretty indifferent to Peter Parker as a character but he had a lot of great lines and moments and I may actually be inspired to go see Spiderman Homecoming which I otherwise wasnt planning on doing.Sam continues to be awesome. I neeeeed more Sam and Bucky interaction like yesterday. Oh my god they were great together.Natashas reasoning for why she decided to be proAccords worked really well for me I was afraid it wouldnt. I do ship Steve and Natasha or more accurately SteveBuckyNatasha in fic but I really really love that their relationship in the films is platonic and I think its one of the best relationships and certainly one of my favorites in the MCU. Due to the nature of the plot we didnt get to see as much of it in CW as TWS but what we did see was really nice. I teared up all over again when she told Steve she didnt want him to be alone after Peggys funeral.I also continue to love Wanda and liked Vision much better than I did in AoU where I was almost entirely indifferent to him although I would have liked to see a little bit more of his reaction and Tonys reaction to his reaction to accidentally shooting down Rhodey. Im still a little weirded out by the thought of WandaVision but I liked their relationship in the film enough that I think Ill be able to get on board that ship ifwhen it eventually sails.I still like Sharon and still dislike SteveSharon but I guess thats just going to be my cross to bear going forward. I really wish they hadnt left her as Peggys relative because I think Id like it if not for that but I just cant get over it and it made the timing of that kiss days after burying Peggy feel extra weird.Clint and Scotts motivation for getting involved was more puzzling to me but they both had some great character moments even if I thought they were kind of unnecessary. Edit Okay somebody on rmarvelstudios pointed out that Clint probably got involved over concern about Wanda being held against her will which works for me after the rapport he built up with both Maximoffs in AoU. Still confused about Scott though especially since it will likely separate him from Cassie. Again.I was disappointed by Zemos motivation  pretty cliched imo  but other than that I liked him as a villain.The reason it felt a little more Avengers . than Cap  to me was that even though Cap and Buckys relationship was central to the plot the emotion of the storyline was given much more to Tony. RDJ acted the hell out of it of course but I would have liked to see a little more interaction between Steve and Bucky that wasnt just fighting together. That was a little disappointing although it does leave lots of room for fic writers to fill in the gaps and we will so Im not complaining too much. Tony man. I am Team Cap and seeing the movie didnt change that ironically in the real world I think I would be Team Tony but in a universe where the US government gets infiltrated by actual Nazis for  years without anybody noticing I definitely come down on Team Cap but god did Tony have a bad week and I felt so awful for him even as I wanted to scream at him to STOP. I definitely understand what people meant when they said that the last quarter of the film is an emotional horror story. Much like Zemo he was blinded by guilt and grief and rage to the point that he couldnt stop even while he was literally standing in a room with the chair they used to brainwash and torture Bucky and the dead bodies of the other five Winter Soldiers surrounding him.,marvelfans,d2vet6g,5,t5_39vma

7578323,0,t1_d32jtrz,I know right? Theres a part where Tony is talking to Steve and he says something likegt You rescued her from a place she didnt even want to leave.I was like seriously dude? You would know this how?Also I was listening to this song and it made me think of Civil War. I think the lyrics do a great job of conveying the feelings of everyone involved but mostly I think of Tony and Steve.,marvelfans,d33marz,2,t5_39vma
7770733,0,t1_d3p7aen,Im curious why youd put Steve in Slytherin because he seems almost antithetical to their traits Im not talking about the blood purity but its been a while since I read Potter. What are your thoughts?  ,marvelfans,d3pgxdn,2,t5_39vma
7906154,0,t1_d3ydge4,Just finished No Song Unsung No Wine Untasted.  I really enjoyed it. it wasnt typical angstymopey stucky fic instead it was a bit madcap and a bit dark humor like you say.  And a nice look at russian culture to boot. Good rec! D  If its okay with you Ill leave more freedback when I get to your other recs. ,marvelfans,d44q6k1,1,t5_39vma

8425822,0,t3_4v0ns3,BuckySam With SteveTChalla in the background series a thrill to press my cheek to by prettylittlementirosaSynopsis to the first story in the series The Lion Sleeps TonightgtSams too cold to be embarrassed by how quickly he scrambles to get in there. Its a tight fit getting two grown men into one regular sized sleeping bag but they make it work. Bucky shifts this way Sam slithers that way. Bucky pulls Sam flush against his chest Sam tries not to dwell on it. Bucky breathes hot air onto Sams exposed neck Sam tucks his icecold toes in between Buckys legs. Bucky sighs contentedly Sam wills his dick into submission.Or  times Sam and Bucky are forced to share a bed   time they choose to.,marvelfans,d5urpbv,3,t5_39vma

8957658,0,t3_52wfuh,Okay heres onelinkaoSteveBucky explicit BDSM with emphasis on the SMThis was an interesting read for me because it is way more hardcore with the pain play and verbal humiliation than I usually go for to the point that it went well beyond my headcanon of what they would be likely to do to each other although you never know this is a pair that literally uses each other as projectile weapons so maybe I underestimate how rough they might get and a few parts were even approaching squick territory but at the same time it was genuinely sweet. I am fond of established relationship fics where the love and intimacy between the couple is palpable and it very much was in this fic even when they were being total assholes to each other.,marvelfans,d7okrep,1,t5_39vma
