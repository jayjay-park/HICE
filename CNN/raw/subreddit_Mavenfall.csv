5715578,0,t3_3t7svx,I feel the energy system is only a problem when you start the game. Going through adventure mode is much faster than arena I can usually get  to  games in adventure mode a good hour and a half of play before the game reguires a break. Especially on map  which doubles energy use you can be finished in under  minutes. Maybe they designed it this way to allow future content to be conumed more slowly. but when just starting the game it feels like a hard break when you just wanna go.I feel once you get a good strategy daily quests become a fair deal more managable. I can usually complete mine In my one sitting.The disconnects ARE an issue and its not even the fact that the game crashes the biggest issue I have is when the game does crash you cant rejoin a game. Maybe its for the best missing a whole turn usually spells doom anyways. Its still super frustrating to lose just when you are about to win though. Im glad its getting patched.Unrelatedly the practice mode inside adventure IS free to play. Theres no rewards but you can practice your strategies rather well there.,Mavenfall,cx5kn6q,1,t5_3am0p

5926152,0,t3_3widut,I know this feeling. You cant do something about this try to win your next game and it fixes if you lose it it fixes too but you arent champ  anymore and dont get the rewards.,Mavenfall,cxwg74r,2,t5_3am0p
6051200,0,t1_cybpsnj,Dragonlord Reaper Matriarch Slayer Knight. He sniped both of my Black Dolls with Bonemancer. I didnt get Conjoined Monster until late game and even then he was basically a double health Red Doll cause my opponent wasnt attacking at all. I managed to take out his Bloodstone Knight fairly early took out both his Shield traps with Slayer but he buffed his Brute to  health and just kept healing it. Didnt help that I started out with terrible draws and after  turns I finally managed to get rid of his Heal Totem he summons another one.My problem was that I was also running stall so I couldnt dish out enough damage per turn. I get people dont like stall in general but at least my build can be aggressive. As for Dragonlord I personally think he is a lot easier to deal with then people seem to think. This guy didnt take out a single one of my Mavens because he was never trying to. Games that last  turns which late game turns into play  card then pass are not fun.,Mavenfall,cyctbtj,1,t5_3am0p
6089974,0,t1_cyhuygn,I would but I only have  ipad I play on unfortunately thank you for your advice and yeah Im dreading the time this gane becomes so grindy that its no longer fun too.,Mavenfall,cyhv7f2,1,t5_3am0p

6314353,0,t1_cz7d9qg,Traps are causing the crashes cardano. Throw out a trap as soon as it gets hit game crashes.,Mavenfall,cz7denr,1,t5_3am0p
6434134,0,t1_czkssis,Its the result of poor ladder queuing I suppose thats why I dont actually get mad about it lol. My main comp is a very flexible and powerful one so I dont know if I can adapt by using other comps though since the odd of facing a matchup with  or lower win rate is significantly low for me. But I guess I should make some changes too if  like you said  sniping down the same player becomes a legal strategy.Any suggestion for an interesting comp? I prefer comps with high flexiblity and massive swings when things got out of control.,Mavenfall,czktsuc,1,t5_3am0p
6523478,0,t1_czto7j1,Well the entire genesis of this comp was based on how broken not only Frenzy but also Ally Strike was. When it could hit for  that just made the Berserker crazy strong. Now with Frenzy and Ally Strike nerfed the comp did take a hit but I still think its playable if not good based on which Mavens which of their cards and the popular comps. Ive seen far less Stormwalker and hes the main threat to the comp if you ask me. ,Mavenfall,czu2van,1,t5_3am0p
7255203,0,t3_4eqa00,Game is dead. There was an error with my account and they couldnt recover it. Contacted support  times afterwards with no response. Ive moved on to Clash Royale which is updated much more often and is an overall much better game,Mavenfall,d22v574,1,t5_3am0p
7354675,0,t1_d28ggei,I am sorry to hear you are not making money with this game. I do wonder though how much of your failure to gain traction might be rooted in your servertechnical support issues.I only started playing a few weeks ago on android so maybe the server issues are new but in at least one instance you had someone me who attempted to buy gems for your game and received nothing because I got a server disconnect message and could not log into the game. I am guessing I am not the only one this applies too and it has cost you guys more than you realize.Unfortunately you only get one first impression and I think you may have lost a large portion of your target market with issues much like this one.Hope I am wrong by the way. Would love to see the game continue to grow and for you to make some money for all your hard work.,Mavenfall,d2e6cpl,3,t5_3am0p
