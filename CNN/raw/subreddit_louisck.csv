Not really quoteworthy I guess since his face and delivery really makes it.Also So Grandma now. ,louisck,co5q638,2,t5_2qsmq
4053914,0,t3_36zbva,This didnt make me uncomfortable nor did his SNL monologue. I believe his thing is to try to make people laugh at things that are horrendous so ultimately I think that was his end game. The risk of potentially get people talking and laughing about something bad or out of the norm to him maybes outweighs the risk of him looking like a creep see what I did there? I think Louies jokes are just jokes that aim push the boundaries of what people find funny and appropriate in order to humanize what the public can sometimes dehumanize and ignore.Regardless of that though yeah I can see how it could be uncomfortable.,louisck,cridkyk,3,t5_2qsmq

7236866,0,t1_d20c1bl,hes experimenting.   hes testing advertising  or lack thereof except for email blasts  word of mouth  some random bloggercritic interviews and  the jkl show.   he gets all the data of download  streaming  patterns...  and can cross reference everything. not to be overlooked  his company reaps all the rewards as well.  and losses. i can also imagine that the actors he got did this for less than if he was on a network.   but i could be wrong about that. he also understands the concept of people wanting to Watch it on their own terms whenever they wanted to and literally geographically wherever they wanted to as long as they had money and an Internet connection. im also wondering if he could skirt some union rules by not broadcasting  the show. and he knew how personal this was and how unconventional the show was  in terms of being a Bona fide stage play...  and theres less risk and exposure released on his website than on a network that is promoting it   times a day.   by no means am i saying that hes a pussy for releasing it this way.   as i said before its an experiment. edit he was also under no constraint to keep it a  minute or   minute episode...  which is so fucking huge in  itself. edit he didnt have to think how to get in and out of a commercial break. edit this could be good or bad   he was not subject to day or timeslot placement by a network.   a crap lead in show could bury any good show. edit he is not subject to any demographics attached to a network or daypart.   he has direct access to those already interested in him. edit depending on contracts with talent and union rules he could possibly distribute this however he pleases  packaged up and sold to yahoo or streaming on google play. hes also at the mercy of some censors at fx. theres no pressure to do a second season.   there was no pressure to promise multiple seasons.  there was no pressure to release a specific amount of episodes  except for budget constraints.   there was no network  ratings pressure of possible midseason cancelation. theres no pressure from advertisers telling you to tone it down. most importantly there was no pressure at all from suits telling you or asking you anything about anything.   he had to only answer to himself and his crew...  which is a handful in itself. when he and cast get emmy nominated and or win emmys   the network will be louisck.net.  not  fx.   ultimate brand building. ultimately this was a huge success for him personally and for his crew.  maybe not financially yet  but doing shit yourself and being your own boss is what its all about. im fully putting words in louies mouth but but being in a semi  related  creative field  i can fully relate. ,louisck,d20s2gf,10,t5_2qsmq
7240144,0,t1_d20c1bl,gt While the show was expensive to produce financing it himself allowed C.K. to exercise his creative freedom without impediment from any overbearing network. Didnt he get that at FX though?What doesnt make sense to me is that if he had to borrow money to do this project then hes not selffinancing.  If he borrowed money from a bank the bank is gonna have expectations for what he is going to spend it on no different than if a network greenlighted the financing.,louisck,d215gwu,0,t5_2qsmq

Saw a few people kicked out of David Cross just for taking the phone out of their pocket.Glad to know there was more than one headliner. I expect the same tonight.

11471489,0,t3_63pix4,I have always loved Louis CKs dark humor. But I felt this was a little too dark almost depressing. Now I know if done right all is fair in comedy but i couldnt help but feel this was a little too dark at some points. Maybe it was just me. ,louisck,dfwadhz,3,t5_2qsmq

11486396,0,t3_63pix4,I saw it yesterday. Honestly I enjoyed it a lot and was definitely laughing out loud like usual. However there was some weird timing parts and jokes dragging that I noticed. It wasnt my number one of his but thought it was still super ballsy and funny enough for me to like it a lot. I think the darkness just comes with our current state in society I dont know though. Yet I liked the darkness and emphasized with it in a weird type of way. Still the dark comedy of this stand up doesnt touch some episodes of Louie so it didnt stand out to me. Overall great show I laughed and laughed and emphasized but HATED the suit,louisck,dfxzccy,1,t5_2qsmq
