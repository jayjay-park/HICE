3185593,0,t3_2wm0j0,I deleted my last comment because I lied to you. I went back and looked.var friends needs to be an object. Theres a few ways you can do that. I went with    var friends  new ObjectBut I believe Im still pretty new to this so I hope Im corrected if Im wrong you can also do    var friends  The rest of your code is right except you need a  after the closing curly bracket under bill and you dont need that last closing curly bracket.    var friends          bill             firstName Bill            lastName Gates            number         steve         firstName Steve        lastName Jobs        number         ,Codecademy,cos6qfi,1,t5_2tc7t
3762811,0,t3_33ig52,In the newest style of courses Rails and AngularJS resetting your progress works better. That sounds to me like the many requests for this feature are being heard. For the older style courses I wouldnt kill off my existing account. I would make a second account to work on the exercises that I wanted to repeat. A tip on that can be found here ,Codecademy,cql6st1,3,t5_2tc7t
3887170,0,t3_34w8gc,Hello I do not know why you are getting nil as a value of state. This is kind of strange. But I see two errors in your code please fix them and check if it solves this problem.First one is here    print  State?It obviously should be    print State?Second problem is in puts statement. To correctly print value of city you have to delete spaces between  and city    puts Your name is firstname lastname from city state!,Codecademy,cqzddco,3,t5_2tc7t

4914191,0,t3_3i5f4v,Hi thereWhen you switch languages in Codecademy you can think of it as starting as a new user. Your progress hasnt been lostif you switch back to the language you started with your progress will still be there. I know this is confusing and were actively working on a solution to sort out this issue. I recommend sticking to one language so that your progress remains consistent.You can change your language preference in your Account Settings.,Codecademy,cudyygx,1,t5_2tc7t
