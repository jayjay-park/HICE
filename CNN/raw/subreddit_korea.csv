149332,0,t3_1vrm8o,Theres not many common tourist scams in Korea.  Korea is already very safe to begin with and the gov loves having tourists so you will be treated pretty well.   Taxi companies take complaints pretty seriously so if you feel like youve been mistreated then write down the taxis id number and call it in.  There were a couple times when some taxis didnt want to go the way I was heading late at night but they quickly gave in after I threatened to report them.  Otherwise there wont be blatant tourist scamming going on.  The only thing I can think of is services grey area massages or food usually seafood where the price is negotiable.  They might try to charge you a couple won more but thats not really a scam and it comes down to your haggling skills.  All in all its pretty safe and I wouldnt worry too much.  One time I left my brand new Galaxy phone on a bus to Jirisan.  Someone turned it in to the local police station and the police chief long distance called my Dad listed in the contacts in the US to say they found my phone.  They very kindly shipped it to me without asking for anything when they realized I was far away in Seoul.  ,korea,cevfu7e,18,t5_2qiog

267328,0,t1_cf8c5rq,gtAlso Im guessing you put in a lot of time with vocabulary? How excactly did you do it? I stare and just forget within seconds I studied Korean in an academic setting for a year so I memorized large chunks of vocabulary for tests. After awhile you get better at it and start to learn more vocabulary faster. Now that Im not in school whenever I see a new word I just write it down actually save it in Naver Dictionarys word box thing and study the entire list at the end of the week. I started working in an office environment about a month ago so when I get piles of company emails I read them during my free time and try to learn useful words that I didnt know by saving them and reviewing them later. The good thing about Korean words is that many of them are derived from Chinese characters so you see the same syllabes used over and over again across many words with similar meanings ie    comes up a lot in words having to do with actuality and being real like  which means realtime   comes up a lot in words having to do with emotions   is related to an exchange of words like in  and   comes up a lot in words relating to use ...and so on for hundreds of words. Its to the point where you can figure out words meaning based on those common elements. Ive heard it actually helps to learn the Chinese characters these words are based on but I never bothered with that just some Kanji when I lived in Japan. The other thing is just to always read stuff. If a word looks familiar look it up. Translate it in your head. Read it aloud etc. All of this helps... and explains why my readingwriting ability is way higher than my speaking ability!,korea,cf8gvpk,3,t5_2qiog

415810,0,t1_cfnkkwx,The reason the standards are so low is because the market for English teachers is inflated to the extent where there are always employers looking to hire just about anyone who can qualify for the visa. If the visa standards were tightened ie you needed qualifications then a lot of hagwons wouldnt be able to find teachers legally. The standards will start improving once the market starts shrinking back to a normal size. It already happened in Japan you need to be hot shit be hired on as an English teacher in a school in Tokyo. In ten years youll need to be hot shit to teach at a school in Seoul and all the losers will be flocking to China in droves. Actually because the visa regulations have tightened in recent years the ratio of loserswinners has gotten a little bit better amongst English teachers. When I first came over in  it wasnt uncommon to meet people with fake degrees who were running from the law back home. Back then you met many people who would be unemployable in their home countries now many of those people wouldnt make it here unless they were in the boonies. ,korea,cfnv4r4,2,t5_2qiog

As an AsianAmerican I would catch racist shit in my own country people would try to make me feel like I did not belong and I was a foreigner in a country I was born and raised in but you know what those people are assholes not all Americans just those people. Its the same here there are racist Koreans but that does not mean all Koreans are racist. Also I understand that the Korean language labels us all as outsiders and therefore not part of society but I feel like there are aspects of this to every culture. If you do not grow up in a culture you are an outsider you will not understand things the way everyone else does. Its like an insidejoke on a national basis if you werent there for it you wont get it. I try to see things the way Koreans see them and try to empathize but I understand that there will always be times where we have fundamental differences because I was raised as an American and my Korean friends were raised as Koreans.It just seems like a copout to say Were negative because were excluded and leave it at that. There are marginalized people in ever country within their own countries for many. I dont think we are entitled to inclusion without significant effort on our part.

The meat was too grisly and chewy and it seemed like the whole cooking process was just putting some shitty meat in boiling water with some chopped garlic. The place had such a creepy vibe and reminded me of a really tacky wedding hall. All of the Korean looking people there also looked like they were from  so I wondered if I saw real North Koreans.I left before the show started but they had the MIDIs to some North Korean patriotic songs playing while I ate. The one was about how Kim Sung Il was born on top of Baekdusan but there was another one about miscellaneous virtues. I thought it was interesting that there were songs like that made in noraebang format. I never really pictured some North Korean workingman going to a noraebang.

This has created a negative drugs culture in Korea where basically youre just fed shit loads of drugs in order to cure you rather than taking more time to do a correct diagnosis. Its been like that in other hospitals Ive been to in Asia also.Anyway in the end the drugs fucked up my stomach and gave me terrible acid reflux. I was getting stomach pain for months afterwards.

1058679,0,t3_268dbg,. From the sound of it everything wrong with Jason will be blamed on you. That one is not so much a Korean thing but a parental and somewhat Christian thing. The parents believe they raised their son in a righteous environment therefore if their son turns out to be less than perfect including physical problems such as being overweight it must be attributed to an external source AKA you especially since the female runs the kitchen in Korean households. But if you bond with everyone and show them youre not actually Satan even if you are a ginger with no soul Im sure theyll come to realize that you are a good person and that just maybe their son isnt perfect. But youre able to accept him for who he is so his parents should be able to do so as well. At least my parents were able to realize Im not perfect. Im sorry I got into Berkeley instead of Harvard mom  Yes you will stand out. But most of the reaction will be intrigue and shock rather than anything negative or positive. People wont touch your hair though most Koreans tend to keep to themselves when it comes to touching people they dont know too well although kids might be a different story. Yes yes and HELL YES. Another reason why Korean parents strive so hard to make their kids perfect. Kids are a reflection of their parents in Korean society. Like every fucking detail. I dont have anything good to say about this issue. Its fucked up all around because all parties get shafted. I feel bad for the parents and the kids because neither of them really have much of a choice due to social pressure. There wont be as much pressure on you because youre not Korean. Even though you feel that his parents will be very judgmental that has nothing to do with you being nonKorean. In fact if you were Korean there would be more expected from you.I hate to affirm your fears but its going to be stressful for you and even more so for Jason. However you seem quite aware of that. On the bright side underneath the judgmental exterior of Korean relatives Korean families are very dependable. They might even seem overbearing at times but they have your best interests at heart or at least what they perceive to be your best interests. My advice? Just relax instead of being on guard because its not going to do you any good. Take criticism with a grain of salt and realize that any harsh comments your inlaws say isnt out of spite but because of cultural ignorance. The fact that your son hasnt been disowned is a sign that that youve been accepted. I know it sounds like I said a lot of negative things but Korean relatives do really care about family. They just suck at expressing it usually and it takes awhile to understand their way of showing that they care.Edit I only spoke about parentsinlaw but havent touched upon grandparents. Im not too familiar with grandparents since I only met the ones on my moms side but they were really chill. I think your parentsinlaw are the biggest hurdle you have to worry about and all the other distant relatives arent as critical if at all.,korea,chomjym,14,t5_2qiog

The education system here as we all know glorifies misery and endless hours of studying from middle school on with very little end result. It basically amounts to glorified hazing.When have we ever met a Korean adult who strikes us as overburdened with education and knowledge about the world? Ive never had a conversation with a Korean person and been all like Oh how did you know that? and heard the reply I studied it in school did you know we spend more time in school than almost any other country? Thats how I got so wellinformed. Im not usually one to say that Korean students are overburdened with too many activities as I remember being almost but not quite as overscheduled in middle and high school in order to get into a top college.

Im gyopo myself guy and constantly hear shitcriticism from gyopo girls about XYZ not to their liking. Guys tend to just accept things for what they are.We all get the why does your korean suck thing and get fucked over by taxi drivers. We all have to explain why we are not fully korean. We get it.But the gyopo guys tend to deal with it better. Girls tend to either lash out at korean men for not kowtowing to their aggressive attitudes. For example What the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch? and Youre fucking dead kiddo. is totally ridulous and makes you sound like a tool. No where did nyuug say anything personal about you.Gyopo girls also tend to thus leave Korea after  months or a year because they cant adjust to the altered family expectations here. Also I must mention that dating is much different. Korean guys here yeah dress like fobs and wear manpurses but they dont take shit from their women and require girls to dress up in heels and not be fat. This is another reason gyopo girls have more trouble than guys here their attitudes and gender expectations clash with the culture.On the other hand gyopo guys dont always get along well with Korean girls...but the masculine feminine dynamic is still there. Whereas . generation  girls are very westernized they are still very Korean and feminine too. In my experience Koreancanadian girls are very feminine and appreciate their korean roots as well. For some reason its the KoreanAmerican girls especially from the East coast that are the most whitewashed and looking to rebel by having their white bf. TLDR You sound like a fool talking about unholy retribution. And your overreaction is glossing over a very REAL and INTERESTING issue among the gyopo community.

2237575,0,t3_2kqamv,Koreas cheating problem lies in a more deeper cultural issue. The west is generally more concerned with integrity along a wide spectrum for all people. Asia is more about favoritism. What does this have to do with cheating? Well in China they call it Guanxi. In Korea the similar but not same term is Jung. These ideas make it easier for people to cheat in a wide variety of contexts. The idea is that victimless crimes arent really crimes. Especially if you dont know the person. While the cultural assumption is that Asia is collectivist it only works in groups of people within their own circle. Asians tend to be much more defensive and willing to put up a fight for a friend or family member but also more willing to let a stranger die in a street without helping. Usually believing something along the lines of not my problemYou see this in a wide variety of contexts. In the west our concern for others is more much spread among people but also not quite as strong as it is in the East. We try to hold ideals and virtues more than personal favoritism. Which is why you see much more cheating in Asia. This doesnt just apply to schools its what you see in contracts business and politics. Its everywhere really. But generally you see this kind of behavior in high density areas not just Asia. But because Asia is so populous its a common cultural norm. ,korea,clo8zr3,6,t5_2qiog

There is no walking culture here people just kind of do as they will and I guess assume others will react on their behalf or something. I dont mind giving way if there are some inherent guidelines involved but the idea of constantly dodging everyone and sacrificing my own rights as a pedestrian I cant believe Im even referring to such a thing but there it is just to avoid being in another persons way strikes me as a crock of bullshit.Rather than shoulder check everyone that attempts to wander into me Ive started to take to raising my arm up like I am rubbing the back of my neck or something. My elbow ends up sticking out at right about the perfect height to be seen as something to avoid and the threat is thus mitigated.The habit thats been really getting to me lately is how people will always take the inside when going through a corner regardless of whatever the apparent trend of walking to the left or right may be in a particular instance.

Well all I did was ask him to make it about this high. So for  I got a nice elevated shelf that is actually heightadjustable you know click the thing into place on wheels. The shelf part is about  feet by  feet which to me is perfect for a desk I mostly use it to stand at my computer as Im doing right this very minute and Ive got it to a height between my chest and belly. The wheels lock its always been sturdy and overall Im totally satisfied with it. The guy even delivered it. I too tried the desk on a desk at first and it was miserable. This thing?

2816191,0,t1_cno6ifb,It is certainly a very effective way of distributing rights to monopoly rents in a systematic though now rather laughably parochial and oldfashioned way. And its a very astute point you make about the security that it confers and its this need for a security of livelihood that makes the sector so difficult to reform. When you have a group of smallscale farmers relying on a particular crop for their annual income it greatly helps them to have the yearly festival where everyone comes to town buys the crop and bolsters the local economy. Its a system youll find in many agrarian economies. Unfortuantely this network of subsistence farmers also empowers a distribution monopsony to exploit it as no one farmer has the financial wherewithal to bypass the system and sell his crop elsehwere except out of the back of a bongo truck. Any attempt to reform distributions leads to protests that these poor farmers will be ruined! though these protests emerge from the very organizations who rely on the nearpoverty of farmers to ensure their own continued power to exploit them. Change will have to come soon however if only because most of these small farmers are old and getting older and there is no one there to replace them. Farms will be bought up and consolidated and the distribution system will have to change to deal with more powerful operators. Whether this will necessarily make things better for the consumer remains to be seen. ,korea,cno6zh3,3,t5_2qiog

A friend flew her pug in cabin on United but it was still just a puppy and met the weight and size requirements. Basically to check a dog with Korean Air you book your ticket and then call a few weeks in advance to tell them you are checking an animal and pay the fee. I think its . They will also ask you for the dimensions of your crate. Another friend went through a vet in Itaewon and for a pretty hefty fee they will take care of all the paperwork transporting the dog to the airport and checking them in for you.

3210288,0,t3_2wup4l,Korea is a great country to travel once you figure out some of its quirks. Its also a fairly affordable place to do so. Here some things Ive enjoyed doing thereSeoul. Theres a ton of stuff to do here.  Gwanghwamun is one of the top spots for tourists and is iconic. Gyeongbokgung isnt a bad palace to see but I find it underwhelming. A better palace is Changdeokgung just east. Its a UNESCO heritage sight and has more original architecture. Heading up north the the street directly east right looking head on of Gyeongbokgung is an area with lots of small shops cafes and traditional city houses. That whole area is worth a wander Sogyeokdong. Hongdae is an area you should go to on a weekend. Its just outside of Hongik University station and especially on weekends is a lively place where university students hang out. There are clubs music venues bars restaurants and street performances.  Myeongdong is entertaining.  Dongdaemun market is a fun place to a little shopping. It can be weird to navigate but it may be worth a gander. Get off at the Dongdaemun Culture and History Park station. Gangnam has some fun stores but I find it a little overrated.  The Seoul National Museum and Korean War Museum are free and can be educational. If you have the time take a train out to Chuncheon about an hour ride and enjoy a smaller city. Its a pretty place and is famous for dakgalbi which you must eat. Busan. I have less experience here but there is some great stuff.  If you like books you must check out the Bosudong Book Alley. Its insane the amount of books they jam in the stores. Theyre reasonable priced and while most books are in Korean many are in English Japanese and so on.  Gamcheon culture village is another fun place to walk around. Its a pretty common hillside postKorean war neighborhood but artists have painted murals everywhere. Navigating the bus there can be a little tricky but its worth it.  The Jagalchi market is another fun place to wander.  Haeundae is a cool beach but gets pretty crowded. Other placesIf youre into history Gyeongju is a fun place to visit and can be a day trip from Busan. It has Bulguksa a UNESCO sight and the whole city is a protected cultural sight as well. Another day trip from Seoul is Sokcho in Gangweondo. Its about a little over two hour bus ride from the East Seoul bus terminal. Sokcho is a pretty town on the beach and up against some of Koreas prettiest mountains. They have good seafood there as well.  Haeinsa is another UNESCO temple worth seeing. Its a bus ride from Daegu to get there but if you have the time. Travel tips  If you feel brave limousine buses are the cheapest way to go long distances in Korea. The KTX train is good but limited. I say if you feel brave because sometimes the bus systems can be a little intimidating if you dont know the language. A lot of places in Korea take credit cards but many dont. Have some cash.  I booked all my hostels on hostelworld.com and found them to reliable and cheap. Couchsurfing is another good option in Korea.  Learn to read Korea if you want. Its a twentyfour character alphabet and should only take you a day and will be very helpful in Korea. I could say more I guess but this is already pretty long. ,korea,couqutp,3,t5_2qiog

When I first came here I had he same problem as you I would try to withdraw money from different ATMs but got the same error message. I found that the machines are kind of picky about what kinds of buttons need to be pressed. My problem was that I was pressing the wrong options for withdrawal.I found the Citibank ATMs in subway stations always cooperate with my card. Sometimes when I go into a Citibank and withdraw from their machines I get all sorts of weird error messages for some reason.But Ive also had a different ATMs located outside of convenience storesthe company escapes my mind work in Seoul AND Busan. Find your nearest ATM. Push the English option even if you speak Korean it gets you to where you need to be faster It should have an option for foreign VISA card press that. It will prompt you with a withdrawal menu. Youll want to push the  WITHDRAW FROM CHECKING ACCOUNT  option. All other options just simply wont work for withdrawals Ive tried them all. Enter your pin. If I recall correctly some ATMs offer only  digits for a pin while a lot of BOA users have  digit PIN numbers. Majority of Citibank ATMs dont have that problem. I havent come across a machine like this in a while though so Im not quite sure about that.Also if you need to take out large amounts you might get an error message. A lot of machines have a W limit and if you try to take out more youll get a message saying you dont have enough funds in your account. Disregard that and just try to take out a smaller amount.Im not sure if this helped at all but Ive been in your situation where my BOA card was stressing me out for weeks until I got it to work properly. I pay for my rent in cash so it definitely IS possible to take out money from the ATM with our cards!,korea,cp6jrea,3,t5_2qiog

In order for those things to be the cause for why the negativity is worse here than in other subs would mean those things would have to be unique to Korea but they arent. However just because you are in Korea doesnt mean you can just single people out unfairly. there is a way that expats complain when they are overseas that they dont do when they are home. They hold on to that us vs them mentality and refuse to acknowledge that the people in the country around them are also human and actually not any different than the people back home. Theyre still people. Its a point Ive made for years. People back home say An asshole bumped into me todayan expat in Korea says Some soju swilling adjoooeshee that stank of kimchi stepped all over my shoes what a fucking shit hole third world country this is!edit Its amazing the handholding we need to do for some people hereWould it be possible for people to read statements in the context of this thread?

4815481,0,t1_ctz7vdl,About  of Korean GDP is produced by the top  corporations. Millions of people apply for jobs at these companies every year. Far too many for any single company to interview so they rely heavily upon education to filter out job applicants. If you dont get a university degree then youre literally locked out of  of the jobs here. Youre doomed to a minimum wage job.Universities operate under the same principle. Your CSAT score determines your university not your interviewskillsability.Its different in the USA.  of American GDP is created by businesses with less than  employees. Small businesses care less about education and more about interpersonal and practical skills. So you can do just fine without a university degree as long as youve got other stuff to show for it. Theres also less competition for jobs because USA is geographically a much bigger nation  not many people living in California are going to apply for a job in New York.  But in Korea people living in Busan will definitely apply for jobs in Seoul. Its also much easier to start your own business in USA because there are fewer regulations and banks are more willing to finance startups. Small business loans dont really exist here in Korea most people rely upon their families to finance new homes and businesses.From what Ive seen most kids do not do extracurriculars.

4892381,0,t1_cub6g8d,I shouldve been more clear with my question. What I meant was a projectile interception system to shoot down incoming threats from North Korea. Something that would destroy airborne rockets and mortars from the North so that the South is unable to be affected by such threats. Incidents like yesterday could have been easily prevented with an air defense system like the Iron Dome or the Patriot Air and Defense system. The South is more than capable economically logistically and militarily to install and use these technologies to defend against incoming North Korean threat. In fact arent missiles and mortars the only things threatening the South? Because there is no way in hell the North would send actual troops and vehicles unless they are trying to commit suicide. Considering that Seoul the heart of South Korea is basically a sitting duck to such threats how is it possible that theres nothing to stop them? Obviously the joint U.S and South Korean forces is more than capable of completely annihilating North Korean forces if it came to war. Actually Im sure South Korea alone would be more than enough to handle North Korea. But what I dont understand is how a developed country like South Korea that is facing perpetual imminent threat has no means to directly counter it. ,korea,cub82fs,1,t5_2qiog

Visitors may be overwhelmed by the sheer exuberant friendliness of Americans especially in the suburb of New Jersey where I once lived. Sit next to an American on a park bench and he will more so than she immediately address you by your first name.gt gt Where you from? So how do you like it in the States? he asks. Oh its a beautiful country I like it very much Id truthfully say. After a moment of reluctance I add From Korea. I often wonder why I feel that way. Then he would start to explain his recent divorce in intimate detail invite you home for dinner introduce you to everyone including the dogs and wrap you in a warm hug on parting.gt gt Mind you this does not necessarily mean he will remember your name the next day. Americans are friendly because they just cant help it they like to be neighborly and want to be liked. However you should realize that a few happy moments with an American do not translate into a permanent commitment of any kind. Indeed permanent commitments are what Americans fear the most. This is a country whose most fundamental social relationship is the casual acquaintance including Internet friendships. gt gt Americans are proud to be American  its the best country in the world. Yet each individual will explain that he or she personally is not like other Americans. They are proud to be different from each other and from the world. There is no such thing as a plain American anyway. Every American is a hyphenated American  AfricanAmericans IrishAmericans ItalianAmericans JapaneseAmericans MexicanAmericans KoreanAmericans and so on. It doesnt matter that he speaks not a word of any language besides English and has never been farther west than the Hudson River.gt gt Europe is not very well differentiated in the American mind. American tourists on guided tours return home with the vague notion that the Eiffel Tower is somewhere in the neighborhood of the Tower of Pisa. They cant differentiate Korean from Japanese or Chinese and vice versa and confuse the Demilitarized Zone in the peninsular with the Great Wall in the continent. They know that the Chinese character is the only writing system in Asia. Americans find it hard to pronounce Pyongyang and cant locate the city geographically. It will confuse them further when the PyeongChang Winter Olympics begin.gt gt Frenchmen worry about their livers. Koreans worry about their English accents. Americans worry about their hair. The hair on their heads that is while women remove most of their other hair. What do young Americans notice first in an initial meeting? The answer from both men and women would be hair. Having good hair is more important than having a college education. The largest section of display shelves in American pharmacies like CVS Rite Aid Walgreens Kmart and Shoprite are for hair care products like shampoos conditioners cream rinses permanent colorants temporary colorants and styling mousses. This means that the average Americans hair contains more chemicals than Tianjin China.gt gt Hair makes a political as well as a personal statement. Look at the fashionable hair style of Donald Trump. Madam Hillary Clinton was famous for changing her hairstyle as first lady. When she became a senator she changed it yet again. Clinton himself made headline news when he had his hair cut allegedly for  in his airplane on the taxiway of Los Angeles International Airport.gt gt The writer used to live in a suburb of New Jersey.

And it came RIGHT AFTER the DMZ incident that maimed the two SK soldiers this summer. Which means that she had a very good reason to explain to the US why SK was attending the event  to show SKs appreciation for Chinas efforts to rein in KJE. In addition by attending the event she forced North Korea to stay away. There was no way in hell North Korea would share the viewing stand with President Park.. It shows the US that despite South Koreas strong relationship with the West South Korea has to take steps to make nice with China for regional security and economic reasons. North Koreas recent actions make that especially relevant nowadays.. No matter how bombastic the parade was it was the anniversary of Chinas liberation in World War II and China was arguably the country most traumatized and damaged by the war. It was a serious mistake for Chinas former allies  the US Britain and France  not to send representatives. And China is going to remember it. ,korea,cvooz88,11,t5_2qiog

5769842,0,t1_cxca8is,gtOh and they mostly cannot speak KoreanThats been my experience though I havent personally spoken with a large number of Koryosaram. One Koryosaram student from Uzbekistan that I used to chat with said that it is rather uncommon for the diaspora in Central Asia to speak Korean  Russian is the dominant language due to Stalinist assimilation programs. Also I thought Koreans living in Sakhalin were allowed to repatriate? Maybe that was just to North Korea Ill have to check on that again. Edit The Wiki page on Sakhalin Koreans has a few references to South Korea wanting to accept Koreans from Sakhalin but their efforts were reportedly repeatedly blocked by Japan and Russia. There is also mention of the ROK and Japanese governments building a nursing home in Ansan for Sakhalin Koreans. Edit  It may also be worth pointing out that a lot of the Koryosaram have family origins in Hampyeong Hamgyeong Province so moving to South Korea might not even be considered going home for some members of the community. I do agree though that more efforts can and should be made at making the Koryosaram feel welcome in South Korea. ,korea,cxcawdf,3,t5_2qiog

There is some historical truth to this claim but its mostly an exaggeration on the Norths part. The South was definitely involved in skirmishes and MIGHT have even fired first. From wikipedia I know not the best...gt  Fighting began on the strategic Ongjin peninsula in the west. There were initial South Korean claims that they had captured the city of Haeju and this sequence of events has led some scholars to argue that the South Koreans actually fired first.This of course doesnt mean that the South started the war as the North had already been planning and getting permission to invade from Russia. The North was simply waiting for the opportunity or the excuse to invade. It wouldnt be far fetched to say that the South might have given them an excuse with a skirmish in Ongjin but it would be far fetched to say that the South started the war. ,korea,cxhpdcf,1,t5_2qiog

Ill check next time on Im line two but Ive ridden at the back sometimes for transfer points and never noticed anyone in the back of that subway cab there. When I rode in Fukuoka the conductors there were not on the trains. They were at the station waiting on the platform. The train would pull up and theyd visually inspect the doors and then signal the driver. On JPRail they might ride on the train itself but I dont think they do on the subway. The tokyo video I posted suggested the conductor was also waiting on the platform itself for the train to arrive and inspected together with the driver and verified that the train details and that they were on time.

6563560,0,t1_czy7oh9,Japs and chinese also got their asses beat plenty in return. Since koreans were more interested in reading books and writing poems than trying to pick fights they developed cool machines to do the fighting for them. It didnt always work out especially when there was no one to man the weapons because everyone ran away. Also what use were  panokseon guarding Busan port when the commander sunk them all and fled when he saw hundreds of harmless transports headed his way.When the king fled to Pyongyang and peasant militia faced the Japanese with pitchforks the government kindly provided them with shrapnel shells and hwachas which they used to blow the samurai to smithereens despite all their bushido and painted masks. The Imjin war is loaded with ironies. Some Japanese daimyos didnt want war and presented  the matchlock gun to korean court hoping that war would be avoided if Hideyoshi knew korea had matchlocks but korean officials were not convinced that a slow loading gun was better than a bow that fired a dozen times faster. Korean bows at the time were practically the best in the world too especially the pyeonjeon that fired baby arrows the size of chopsticksA funny excerpt I picked out from the Correction Book written by Ryu Seong Ryeong was how a korean officer and his troops faced off with the vanguard of an invading Japanese army and when the Japanese sent their redmasked champion forward on horseback sword flashing the korean officer sent his own who simply pulled out a bow and killed him with an arrow to the neck frightening away the rest of the soldiers. The Japanese were probably like Dang. That never happened before. but that just shows the  vast difference between a warrior culture and a bookish one. Also there was this one ferocious Japanese general named Sayaga who flat out defected to the korean side with  troops despite the fact that it was hard to find a korean outpost to defect to because they were all busy running away from the Japanese. Sayaga liked korean culture and believed he should not attack the source of korean neoconfucianism  that many Japanese viewed positively. So he was given a korean title and beat the Japanese back in their own game. ,korea,czy86j9,8,t5_2qiog

The show also premiered on primetime television on MBC on Lunar New Year holiday so I imagine many families had watched the program together Right now is pretty interesting because many producing companies have been messaging me that they would want to help me build a youtube channel like Dave or The Englishman . Also many Koreans have said that they are sending in applications for me to appear on other shows like  . I can say that the show was  percent impromptu. I was getting on the train with my head down and looked up and saw  cameras and I knew something strange was going on.  I thought they were making a documentary about an old man who may be near death.. however when the production team started laughing and I looked closely at his face I could notice he was wearing some makeup I began to realize that he was the person whom he was talking about.

I would be wary when ordering nonKorean foods like Pad Thai. Korean desserts can contain peanuts. Hotteok is one. There is a round peanut cracker that is a traditional Korean snack you should avoid. I havent seen Peanut oil at grocery stores and I cannot recall places that cook using Peanut oil. I would imagine foodie restaurants that make use of nontraditional ingredients might have dishes that use peanuts or peanut oil.How allergic are you? I had a friend in high school who couldnt even in the same room with peanuts as just the particles in the air would be enough to go into shock.

NK wasnt going to let that shit happen and so they got their commie buddies to help. US stepped in to help SKs democratic government. To say that Korea would not have been taken over by communists had it remained united under its true leader is idiotic. How can the country remain democratic if the leader is communist?

If you had the original document with you here in Korea then the embassy could easily make a notarized copy of it but it sounds like you dont.The easier and cheaper thing to do is to contact your university. Ask them to mail you a new diploma here in South Korea and then just include it with your submission as an original diploma. Or get a notarized copy of that and include it with the submission.

6917207,0,t3_3tw1qq, I am an English teacher and my main goal while here is to become fluent in Korean.  Being an English teacher and trying to study Korean is actually a terrible idea but I had to work to get my school loans paid off before studying more. Dont get me wrong I love teaching English but having the priority of teaching English and learning the Korean language in Korea creates great conflict.When I am working I am more than happy to speak English with my students and fellow teachers but once I clockout then I constantly use Korean when interacting with people. You gotta be proactive in your relationships. The sad thing is language and relationships are very much intertwined.For the most part I sadly dont accept social opportunities that I find through work or ones that are geared toward foreigners. Most of the time even if its something as simple as dinner with a coworkers family there is an expectation that Ill be speaking English to their family. For example one time after teaching classes my boss invited to his house for lunch and first thing when I arrived I was introduced to his ten yearold and asked to help her do her workbook. To be honest cause I am the Native English teacher at their school the fact that they have this expectation is kind of understandable. They dont see the issue the same way you do.  My boss probably has no idea that most people respond to me in English and they dont know truly how many times you make a friend and their comes that time when they ask for English conversation meetings. They dont know that when they say the English word for every Korean word they utter it doesnt really help you learn any Korean. Also because I usually only speak English in school coworkers especially the English teachers have a very very low expectation for my communicative ability.  Instead I try to find friend through other outlets. Ive wondered around my sister and found a soccer field. In Korean I went to the counter and asked the guy who runs the place how I could join a team.  Also I often go to the pool and can meet people there while Im swimming in the lanes. All of this can be very hard though. Honestly I often find myself lonely and in that moment doubting my choice to avoid English situations. I am a very extroverted person I love people and I love loving them and sometimes I think Im a terrible person for avoiding people or not giving English practice to friends who ask. Also a lot of times it feels like there is no one I can relate to because just about all of my foreign friends dont seriously want to learn Korean to use it.But the truth is its paying off. My Korean ability is improving quickly especially compared to my English speaking friends and even though in this season there are a lot of English friendships that never came to be there are a lot more people Ive grown close to that I couldnt have if I didnt speak Korean.Last note if you find someone keeps speaking English to you every time you speak Korean I dont think it would be to impolite to ask  .   the second or third time you run into them. They may not know its killing you every time they speak English. You left your country your friends and your family to come to their country and learn their language. I dont think there is anything wrong with asking this. Plus the alternative is to avoid them which would be even more impolite.We can do this people! !!!!

South Korea has also been a pioneer in using clean technologies and reducing emissions in many of its industries clean coal accounts for over  of its installed coal capacity. SK is building more clean coal plants to replace the remaining  of coal plants that are dirtier as well as the old Wolsung and Kori nuclear plants which are getting dangerously old. Most of South Korea produced air pollution comes from gas and diesel cars and trucks.  I think S.Korean government should put much more stringent requirements on diesel vehicles similar to the North American standards which almost eliminates diesel cars from being sold.  If South Korea replaces all the vehicles to electric cars that would be ideal.,korea,d1zb0mp,8,t5_2qiog

7428136,0,t3_4h13j1,I spent about  months in Korea in  with no previous experience.  Here are some of my takeawaysPoliteness is very much appreciated especially to people older than you.  When you someone hands you something spare change receipt food take it with both hands.  Dont worry about saying hello to random people you pass on the street.  Its not really a thing in Korea to say hi to someone you dont know.Korean Food is great.  However some of the stuff is a bit out there.  Squid octopus lots of bizarre seafood.   When you go out you can stick to pork and beef and side veggies.  You will be expected to try kimchi.  Get used to it.Any important signs will be translated to English.Most stores will not have automatic doors.  If you go to a store with a sliding glass door theres a little button on the side to open it.  Koreans are super serious during the day for the most part.  After business hours everyone lightens up.  Usually because theyre all drunk.Youll have trouble getting thing a like a cell phone or bank card without help.  Someone will probably have to handle that for you.  Your foreign bank card may not work in most ATMs.If you bring your phone from home youll probably be able to find open wifi at most places.  Any network with Olleh or SK in the name is probably pay only.Youll have to get used to traffic.  Its overwhelming your first few days.  Just be careful crossing the street but dont be too timid or youll never get anywhere.  Practice basic Korean.  Hello thank you and such.  Most younger people will know enough English to understand you.  Older folks not so much.  If you are taller or bigger than an average Korean youll have trouble finding clothes in anything other than a huge department store. won is basically  US dollar.  If you are coming from the USOnce you get used to the traffic consider getting a cheap cc scooter and a helmet.  It beats walking or taking taxis everywhere.  At the very least get a bicycle.If you get sick you can go to a pharmacy and ask the pharmacist for most anything.  It wont be sitting out on a shelf for the most part.  Every pharmacist I talked to understood English well enough.  I never had to deal with an actual doctor but I imagine their English is passable also.  Pharmacies generally have a sign with a green cross on it.Weather wise its hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.Thats all I can think of at the moment.  Dont stress.  People are basically the same all over the world.  Theres not a lot of crime but people may try to take advantage of you if you let them.  Koreans didnt really like public confrontation in my experience so if you are getting hassled just make a scene and theyll leave you alone.,korea,d2mj5b9,6,t5_2qiog

7689716,0,t3_4kk5h9,Thanks OP for posting the details. I found it quite disturbing to know that some people had the nerve to write insensitive comments in light of this incident. its not right.While I understand that the perpetrator was a man whose motive was caused by hatred against women it is wrong to make a sweeping statement that men are entirely at fault. He had been judged to be mentally unstable so I think the main reason should be attributed to this fact. Unfortunately theres always unstable people in society and random acts of violence occur in anywhere. This was no exception. It is however wrong to use this event as a push to serve an unintended agenda.Korea is not a perfect country there are problems such as racism corruption youth unemployment but it is a lot safer than most countries.But! I think its good to have public discourse regarding sexism in Korea because it really permeates korean society as its traditionally patriarchal. Many women have come forward to express their experiences and Ive seen it myself but its counterproductive to go to the extremes of each side of the spectrum as extreme views are mostly disregarded. Constructive discourse will make way for real positive changes.,korea,d3g9s7q,1,t5_2qiog

7734741,0,t1_d3lcqkc,Where do I start?Its not regulated enough. When the government did an audit they found that  out of  apartment managers were engaged in some form of corruption or theft You have managers like mine who will not allow me to report my rent on my taxes because hes reaping the benefits not me. It hurts the lower class. This effects everyone especially people who dont come from wealthy families. It keeps poor people poor by demanding they produce a large sum of money and continue paying rent on top of that. If you have enough money you are rewarded by not paying rent at all. All you have to do is give all of your money to a stranger and let him invest it and keep the profits. Its basically a Ponzi scheme. If tomorrow every tenant in any given apartment said they were moving out and they wanted their jeonse back the apartment would almost surely not be able to do so because the money isnt there. There was a guy on here a while back who told the story of how his landlord went bankrupt and basically lost his  won or something like that. There is nothing that can be done. The bank can sell the building and they might get some of it back. It hurts the middle class. If you dont want to live in a shit hole you have to pay a lot in jeonse. The kind of money necessary for some apartments the ones that are big enough to raise a family in is going to be a couple hundred thousand dollars usually. All that money goes to a small group of individuals who invest it and get wealthy on it. The middle class is the group of people who should be able to invest or create businesses. Its overvalued. Anyone can see that there are new apartment buildings going up constantly...but were told the population is decreasing. So theres a lot of supply and not enough demand. There are probably more apartments in Korea than there are people to live in them. So why the high cost? Believe it or not I do not think living in a Lotte branded apartment is the height of luxury.It hurts the elderly and the job market. The problem with some of it as well is that moving into an apartment is expected after marriage...and the man should be able to pay for it. This is totally ridiculous because no man of marrying age in Korea has saved nearly that much money. So what happens? A lot of times his parents who are on the cusp of retirement give him money. This prevents a lot of people from being able to retire. They stay in the job market well past their time and young people dont get to take over those positions...but this point really has a lot of other problems involved too cultural things mostly.So now that Ive made my pitch...whats good about the housing market?,korea,d3ldviu,2,t5_2qiog

If you take a bus into Taejongdae theres a really cute cafe with a really nice owner near where you get off. I remember the drinks being really good and the owner was nice enough to keep our bags while we walked around the park. Being an ocean city Busan has amazing seafood almost anywhere.

Not sure Trump will be elected and if he was what hed actually do. He takes all sorts of positions and has said some reasonable things as well as scary. He also has a ton of obstacles to pass if he wants to do anything similar issue Bernie would face. If hes elected Id feel safer abroad in most other developed countries though perhaps not Korea or Japan if hes serious about pulling out troops if those countries dont pay. The other thing to worry about living in the US while he is president is the tension between identity politics types and minority groups and white people will likely get even worse.

Meanwhile the debt has exploded real wages have be stagnate for  years more people are on food stamps than ever before and the  of people in the workforce is the lowest it has been in decades.

Rule  is somewhat subjective because otherwise we would have to require exact titles only which I dont necessarily think should be done. As long as someone doesnt put their opinion in the title or use loaded language I think its ok to summarize an article. Maybe the rule should be reworded to give a better idea of whats expected.Normally Ill just flair a removed submission with the reason it was removed rather than write a comment for each removal but I thought that was a topic necessary of being discussed and thats why I wrote the direct response of why it was removed and tried to encourage submitting it again. I think social issues are important and anyone is again welcome to submit the article without editorializing the title.Nobody can moderate  unbiased but I do to try to moderate based on the rules rather than my own opinions or what offends me and did not remove the submission about gang rape because of personal politics. I cant speak for anyone else but if I have a slight doubt Ill generally go towards leaving something alone. Im sure nothing I can say or do will change your opinion since you seem to have made up your mind and would rather create drama about mod actions rather than contacting us directly or reporting what you think is rule breaking like you did here which I responded toIf anything I would point to you still being around shows I try to be objective since I personally find some of what you say offensive and it could be argued breaks the unnecessarily offensive and racist rulegtTheres basically two types of people in this world Those who understand that East Asians lie constantly and those who dont. The former understand East Asian culture the latter dont or are willfully ignorant.gtHowever learn your lesson man. Leave Korea. Its a shithole and they hate foreigners.gtIf women are so oppressed by men in Korea then tell me why Korean men have to come to a foreign website to cry about it? Why cant they resolve this the usual way with a sock in the jaw in a public street. Korean men set your women straight! Sure now they only want to be free of stab wounds but next it will be contusions! This one was removed but you werent banned for it.This thread will be left up for the time being for transparency but if anyone has an issue with how this subreddit is moderated I would recommend sending us a modmail if you would like to discuss it. If someone already did that but then felt they werent being treated fairly I could see making a submission about it but jumping to making a thread complaining about the mods over a couple removals a month apart seems premature.gtIs it any wonder that this sub suffers wave upon wave of brigading and subversion by misogynist and ultra conservative elements in Korean society?What evidence do you have of brigading? There are no tools that allow us to see what websites users are coming from and even if we were brigaded what rules do those users break? Do you want us to ban any conservative commenters?

They can use the regular SAT AP and TOFELILETS if they are applying from a non English speaking country standardized exams to apply. Even then for quite a few programs you dont even have to speak Korean when you apply but student have to learn and pass certain levels before graduation. Graduate programs have low thresholds no GRE is required for most of the ones I looked up. Also even though the classes were taught in English the standard for entry to the school again TOFELILETS based is relatively low causing issues for both Korean and international students in the program. But some international students work really hard?? Students with enough funds who come from prestigious western countries have an easier time getting in. Having a bunch of token foreigners is advantageous for the school especially when they can pay tuition fees. Similar to how in the U.S. international students are sought after for diversity and their . Students who may need financial aid andor who come from unpopularnon prestigious countries do have to work hard to get in. Racial and national prejudice exist in Korea and if you dont have the  or check enough boxes for diversity points then the foreigner advantage may become a disadvantage. This being said I had some classmates who had every disadvantage overcome them with stellar academics. To be fair for foreign students have a huge adjustment to make if they commit to learning Korean and adapting to the culture. It might be easier to get in but it could be harder to get out. It is also very difficult to take semesters off without losing your student visa so unlike Korean students.Is the diversity that superficial? Yes and no sometimes the administration would pressure  students to go to public events and visiting lectures to make Yonsei GSIS look good taking lots of press photos and such.  As for interacting with Korean students I found that the reluctance to make friends and integrate came from both sides a lot of the time. Other foreign friends who spoke Korean well and sought out Korean friends who had the same interests and hobbies tended to have a healthy social life myself included. From time to time I would run into people that made me feel like an accessory white friend and others spoke of the same. You learn to avoid thisignore it after a while.What did foreign profs say? They know the situation and long term stability or involvement is difficult if you have few to no ties in Korea. I know some professors saw the advantages of this if they wanted to do a few years of research in the East Asian region while having a pretty well supported job. Consensus however was that dealing with the politics and administration was tolerable at best and downhill from there. The contracts for foreign professors were very different than those of Korean professors.Personally I think that there are some issues with international education in Korea with the U.S. as well  but that is another story but a degree at a Korean institution can be quite valuable if you know what you are getting in to and what you want to do with it. From the looks of it international programs are only going to grow in Korea and honestly adjustments will have to be made in addressing diversity race culture and ethnicity on campus and by extension in society and the workplace as well but again that is another topic.Tldr Good points in the article. Korean universities have good potential but quite a few barriers to overcome.,korea,d4znsh8,26,t5_2qiog

From the amount of rice on either plates they seem to be doing free distribution which is like a buffet but when you do that the policy isnt to ration such small portions.Second the guy on the far side doesnt even have soup.  And he is wearing a wedding ring.Most likely this is taken at the NCO training facility where they purposefully make shitty food to simulate wartime rations and for the purpose of psychological stress endurance weeks of shitty bland food to demoralize candidates.Also there is no way that meal costs  as even when I was in RoKA the per meal costs averaged  and that was with much better food and dessert.Source I worked finance for Korean Army.,korea,d53yt45,13,t5_2qiog

It might not even be large enough to cover your flight. As a first timer they may not give you a limit much more than ..millionin my case that wouldnt even buy a flight ticket home. Instead of down voting anyone actually want to say whats wrong? Most first time teachers wont be making much more than .. and they wont give your a credit card for  of your income since in Korea you have to pay off  of your credit card every month.

With Hillary most likely winning in November it would probably be the case that she would push for the THAAD option most likely aligning herself with PGH and Yoon Byung Se.I cant help but think the Saenuri Party is using the nukes as a political distraction.

Something simple or even ugly may be complex and beautiful inside but recognizing the humanity of the other would conflict with what he is saying.. JudeoChristian values are not simply Jewish and Christian theological belief. Western values are the product of thousands of years of social development reaching heights of civilization never experienced in Korea. The ideas of equality and humanism have their roots in classical antiquity just as much as they have their roots in the bible or the later spiritual developments in Christian theology. . If confucianism and the Korean mindset had some validity as an alternative to the idea that human beings have value beyond their wealth and appearance Korea probably wouldnt have been a feudal backwater right up until sustained contact with what he calls JudeoChristian values began to reform it and bring it out of the dark ages.. He lauds the idea that everyone knows others status and place in society as determined by wealth age beauty but provides no evidence that this is a positive thing. In fact it perpetuates social divisions and stratification and as we can see currently in Korean politics is fundamentally incompatible with democracy.What a conplete waste of time. An apologetic not only for inhuman selfishness but for idiocy and a return to an animalistic state of existence.Edit Let me add one thing.

10246943,1,t3_5mpfqq,Hi everyone. New to this subreddit  interested in this subject not Japanese or Korean.Ive wondered for a while how issues regarding the Japanese occupation of Korea can be resolved. Like with Japan and China the problem is that even if a deal can be made between governments that doesnt stop members of the public saying they dont go far enough and even pushing for them to be ripped up. Especially in democracies like the ROK and Japan whats to stop a newly elected government backtracking on the actions of its predecessors?Some people have referred to how Germany i.e. Willy Brandt dealt with the Holocaust. However his act of falling to his knees was an individual gesture. Jews could have easily dismissed it as theatre. And if Brandt had made clear his intentions before he had done it would he have had support from his fellow politicians and public? Maybe maybe not.I think its also worth pointing out that countries like Greece that suffered under German occupation even if not nearly as long as Korea did continued to have negative feelings towards Germany but as they were economically weak they became reliant on German goodwill. I seem to recall Poland demanding an apologycompensation some years ago from the Germans and the response was to shut up because Poland whilst under Russian control had waived rights to compensation from East Germany. Which is kind of Japans position on compensation because of the previous agreement with the ROK.So where does this leave the ROK and Japan? I have sympathy with Koreans who feel that Japan isnt properly sorry. But at the same time I think eventually you have to draw a line under historical issues especially if apologies of some form have been made.My guess is that the historical issues wont be dealt with until public opinion in both countries have aligned and similarlyminded governments are in place. This could take a very long time.I would also consider that maybe for any lasting settlement it may be necessary to insist any deal be ratified by the countries parliaments or even the general public.,korea,dc5jqdq,4,t5_2qiog

He proposes to do this by eliminating government waste and corruption. He will also increase corporate taxes by  and also increase income tax of the rich by . By doing this he calculates that his tax increases to the rich will increase the average income tax rate of Koreans from  to higher rate to get closer to the OECD average income tax rate. This means approximately  to  increases per year per rich person. At  According to a US magazine Foreign Policy if either Lee Jae Myung or Moon Jae In becomes the president there could be a clash between Trump and one of the candidates resulting in the US withdrawing from Korea. Lees position is that the US will not dare to withdraw their troops because they are not there to defend Korea but to project American power in Asia. If Trump demands South Korea to increase its share of costs then Lee says South Korea should refuse and let the Americans leave. Lee says SK should be prepared for the US military to leave. His calculation of SKs share of the cost is  of the costs while Germany is paying  and Japan . At  Lee declares war on TV Chosun and vows to destroy the media. Lee says the media is damaging democracy by spreading lies. They are involved in manipulating the election according to him. TV Chosun had reported that Lee forced his older brother into a mental institution and that Lee swore at a group of homeless people and assaulted them.

According to the biography of Song Minsoon who served as foreign minister under former president Roh Moohyun to whom Moon was Chief of Staff Rohs administration sought North Koreas opinion before abstaining from a UN vote in  condemning Pyongyangs human rights abuses. Song alleges that Moon supported the idea  although when confronted the latter has been evasive and has claimed that he does not remember how the decision was made. That Rohs Chief of Staff would not have been instrumental in this decision  which amounted to nothing short of a peace offering to Kim Jongils regime  stretches credulity,korea,dc6lztl,2,t5_2qiog

Mostly actual comfort women survivors yes they care a lot and female college students who are particularly active in many types of humanitarian activity. Look at japanese protests. Bitter old men and male antisocial right wing nationalists.In mainstream korean perception the japanese stance towards comfort women issue is just another reminder that a nation cannot even get a proper apology from another nation if it is weak. So it drives us to become bigger more powerful more competitive more feared. so that we can actually prevent tragedies not only in korea but around the world in the future from countries like imperial japan. Other than that no issue at all. How do you expect barbarians to act civil in your home if you opened your door wide open? We dont blame the japanese. we blame the koreans.

Even better take a picture of the guy and spread it on sns and get him ridiculed press charges settle for compensation the whole  yards. There are also korean women who purposefully lead unsuspecting guys on like this with the intention of charging them with sex harassment so yeah you wont see this level of fuckery around korean women as much as westerners. Foreigners are assumed to not know how to react in such situations so thats an accident waiting to happen. Just be confident and stand for your rights. There are CCTV  everywhere in korea so you dont have to submit to anything you dont want to and no korean is stupid enough to leave such easy incriminating evidence in the streets no matter how drunk they are. korea is safe in the regard that obvious crime like murder theft and rape is easily tracked and criminals put to justice thanks to ubiquitous CCTV but the fuzzy areas like rape while intoxicated or coercion is harder to prove no matter what culture or country so if you keep your senses alert dont drink stuff that could be drugged while you didnt see it you can enjoy the safety and enjoy yourself.

Furthermore it turns out to be legal to buy A in Canada over the counter.  I mail myself drug A from Canada and declare it properly to customs and show my prescription.This would not work. She told me drugs are approved for sale in Korea in conjunction with a distributor. Say distributor Y wants sell drug A in Korea Y would pay for all the FDAlike testing and would get approval. Suppose distributor Z wants to sell A.  Z has to go through the full FDAlike testing all over again.  Needless to say most drugs only have one distributor then they are sold through secondtier distributors.

On the contrary it will be a boon to the economy both short and long term as international investors will rush into unified Korea because everything in North Korea will have to be rebuilt. Think about it everything like roads trains power plants buildings sewage  will all have to be built from complete scratch. Oh my god there will be shortage of workers but that can be remedied by getting the exNorth Korean military to do the jobs. And it also will mean a boon to South Korean consumer goods companies since North Korea will need everything from soaps to diapers to tooth pastes and on and on. South Korean factories will have to go on the overdrive to make all this stuff for the North Koreans who have none of these right now. So how will South Korea pay for all this? By opening up the economy to international investors and taking advantage of plenty of untouched raw materials and resources buried in North Korea.  Everyone points to Germany and how it cost to reunify. But in Germanys case West Germany gave billions in welfare money to East Germans to pull them into the same economic level. Korea doesnt have to do that kind of extensive welfare handouts. North Koreans would not expect that anyway. The Korean welfare handout will be the building of North Koreas infrastructure and giving jobs to North Koreans. A united Germany rose to an economic superpower why cant Korea do the same?  ,korea,ddm3c02,1,t5_2qiog

However Id like to point out that Korea was not always closed off to foreigners.Historically ancient Korea was open to foreigners especially during the Later Silla and Goryeo dynasties. Both were mercantile seafaring nations. In fact the latter was founded by a powerful maritime merchant of Goguryeo heritage. Later Silla and Goryeo served as the final destination of the Silk Road. There are many records of Muslim travelers coming to Later Silla and Goryeo and there is even a record of European priests coming to Korea on behalf of the Pope linkEverything changed during the Joseon dynasty. Joseon practiced a strict form of NeoConfucianism as opposed to Buddhism and looked down on commerce and restricted trade. The merchant class practically disappeared and the population consisted of scholaradministrators and a lot of peasantfarmers just the way NeoConfucianism likes it. There used to be a sizable Muslim population in Korea with the biggest mosque in Kaesong which was the capital of Goryeo and a major port city but during the Joseon period King Sejong banned all Muslim practices and Muslims were never heard from in Korea again for a long time.,korea,de12wqo,12,t5_2qiog

10927470,0,t3_5w351d,Been here since . Quit my job in late  to focus on family and learning Korean. As of Oct  the little Korean I knew was probably worse than when I first arrived I did a short course before coming. For example I couldnt count to ten using either number system. I could tell a taxi where to go but I have since learned my pronounciatuom was wrong for most words. I joined a hagwon and told them I wanted to start from zero. They didnt believe me that I didnt really know anything.For me the main reason for not learning was that I was in an English environment all day and working about  hours a day and several hours a day on weekends too. I just dont have the willpower to study after all that. I was just too fucked. Work never got finishes as it was if there was any more energy or time to be summoned it was to be spent getting the work where it was supposed to be. In addition I would travel about  weeks a year and keeping up language study during those periods would have been a nightmare. Meanwhile living in an expat bubble meant there were no major shortterm downsides to not knowing Korean. My assistant and colleagues were all bilingual as was my Korean girlfriend who then became my wife. And my wife basically hates Korean culture. To this day Ive never seen her watch Korean TV and weve only seen a Korean movie once. Meanwhile in the early days there werent many foreigners who spoke Korean well and many of those who did were weirdos. So you would look at them and say well I dont want to end up like that! There was no social cost to not having the language and if anything there seemed to be a benefit. Dealing with Korean company management at business partners suppliers etc they had to come on my turf rather than me being a beginner in their world.Every now and again I would think about trying to start learning but the cost benefit seemed so deeply negative that Id quickly forget about it. And during all this time I never met a corporate expat who had learned Korean while holding down a serious job. Everyone I met who could speak had either studied it at a university either full time or part time while doing a noncorporate job was an English teacher with lots of spare time had a degree in Korean or came via an embassy program where language training was part of the job. Meanwhile a I knew plenty of people in my boat who had been in Korea for  years and knew nothing including several colleagues.Eventually though the monkey on my back got heavier and heavier as I felt more and more of an idiot for not speaking the language and identified less and less with the corporate expat crowds thinking on the subject. I also had a few highly embarrassing incidents meeting people in other countriessituations who looked at me like I was an Alion when Insaid I hadnt learned it. And then you had at some point maybe  years ago? these foreigners showing up on TV speaking fluently. And as OP says theres the Bangladeshi in the factory. There were no excuses any more. I even met a CEO of a company who had learned while holding down his job so my theory of impossible to learn while working a corporate job theory was dead.Still I couldnt imagine working full time and trying to study in the evenings. I was burned out on work and depressed as it was. So I said fuck it and quit. There were many other reasons to quit anyway.I didnt join a uni program or anything like that. I have to look after the kids now and the idea is to have a good life not be a struggling stressed out student again. So Im going at a relatively slow pace compared to most on this sub. Ive done hagwon classes on and off along with self study and recently italki. Ive done about  hours so far in  months works out to about . hours a day iirc and am low level . Its a struggle. I think I inadvertently trained my brain to ignore incoming Korean audio with high efficiency. For  years it learned to switch off immediately when Korean language was spoken. So I now have to concentrate really hard not to lose the thread of the conversation even when I know all the words and grammar. Ive had to do a lot of remedial work as I could never understand the teachers when they were teaching  in Korean which they did at level  and . An approach thats fucking nuts in my view but thats a discussion for another time! and at level  I understood literally  of the dialogue during listening comprehension exercises. So it goes. Anyway Im not giving up. From everything Ive read if you refuse to quit eventually you will learn it to at least an intermediate level. Im starting to get feedback from a couple of aquaintances that Im mad to keep doing it. But fuck em.Were leaving Korea in a few months but Ive resolved to keep studying until Ive done  hours total. Ill be in another country but with italki internet apps etc that means a lot less than it once did.Theoretically  gets the average student to level . After adjusting for my apparently low aptitude I am confident of getting to level  with that.   hour a day will get more there in three years  hours a day in one. Well see!,korea,de73bjt,21,t5_2qiog

They dont teach anything that can be used and if you do it just a tiny bit wrong the teachers will ether laugh or tell you that you cant do it right.

When Im not buying something then I just get retarded laughter at me for not pronouncing it exactly correct. Then some one from Jeju comes along and it takes them   repeats for the other Korean to understand but thats perfectly ok. The best example of this however is when I used the drive though at crap donnalds. When I use the speaker perfectly fine. No problems at all. They take my order and get it perfectly right.

Also sometimes Koreans will mock an accent because they think its cute like Alberto from  and his  but I know it doesnt always feel that way when youre on the receiving end.I should clarify that I dont think its ok to laugh at foreign language learners and think the OP is way off base. But there are going to be setbacks when learning a language like making dumb mistakes and getting laughed out having embarrassing situations failing tests etc but you cant let that set you back because the only other option is to give up.

11118766,0,t1_des8epv,Okay lets do thisampnbspWe call countries like NK bad because of three things  The people are starving  The government is mean and controlling  Nobody is allowed to leaveBut thats all the same problem right? Theres no food so people want to leave and the government does mean things to make them stay. If there was plenty of food and goods and services no one would be trying to flee so no barbed wire and landmines. Problem solved. SK accepted capitalism and the west  and became rich so why didnt NK? Well lets jump back in time. Before Samsung and LG do you know what South Koreas biggest income was? Prostitution. In s South Korea almost  of the nations gross domestic product came from women selling sex. Encouraged by the pro west government the US installed  million prostitutes aged  and up serviced American troops. Bear in mind this is a deeply patriarchal and conservative country. Bear in mind this is only a few years after the Japanese occupation and the comfort women horrors. A fresh wound compared to the scars SK still carries today. NK took one look and said no thanks. Rightly or wrongly they figured these foreign devils wanted to turn them into a nation of sex slaves like the Japanese so lets try something else no matter how hard.Now the problem with national pride is that it is expensive as Cuba can tell you. The rest is easy to understand. Pride doesnt fill empty bellies so you have to scare people into line. Cant have discussions about surrender so you have to kill all political opponents. Situations like that attract nutcases ie. Stalin Khmer Rouge Kim Il Sung etc.Thats why China chose Mao and went down the road it did. Anything other than foriegn occupation like the Japs gave them. Thats why Vietnam went full Jihad to get America out. Any thing other than Western subjugation like the French gave them. These rogue nations go to the extremes because thats what independence costs. What youre asking these enemy countries to do is lay down their arms in the hope that America and the west give them a fair shake. Judging by what Ive seen happen to certain regions like Iran and Iraq in the mid east I dont think thats in any way guaranteed. Anyway the point is I dont believe that anything comes from nowhere. If someone like these Chinese posters have a different world view on something than you try to put yourself in their shoes or dig around to find out how it got that way. ,korea,desaxmp,8,t5_2qiog

Both politicians officially Roh actually began the project with the intent to create the basis of an independent South korean aerospace industry.You cannot possibly say that just because one person in the same party says a different tone than Moon or Roh that it speaks the individuals in question.Then what about the bibak anti Lee Myung Bak faction that calls for Parks impeachment? Do they speak for Park or her chinbak pro Lee myung bak faction  that supported her? Of course not. Park inherited a much wealthier powerful South Korea than the Minjoo party even with Lee Myung Baks great fuckup with the  great rivers project and business nepotism.And yet her administration didnt start anything the Kim Dae Jung or Roh Moo Hyun administrations started with regards to the military. At least Lee realized the folly of delaying wartime operational commandship and pushed to increase the payload and range limits for South Korean missiles while giving frontline commanders to engage in active defense should they be attacked.South Korean business transparency cases of military corruption business environment ratings and pretty much every socialbusiness indicator becane worse under. Parks administration.It was Parks administration that the term hell Joseon cane to light.And Im not supporting the Minjoo Party.

11143925,1,t1_dev4h1x,gtYou know it sounds like a bunch of nationalistic bullshit to me. And thats coming from a Korean. Does the land being culturally Korean have anything to do with Chinas right to build a national park in their own land? Its been over a millenium since any land north of the Tumen was Korean and the identity of Korea didnt even exist back then. Nationalism is an idea sprung from the th century.gtEither way that land isnt just Korean its shared by a bunch of other tribes as well. Just because its close to Korea and Koreans have settled in foreign land doesnt make it any more Korean than Russians in Crimea.gtIll believe your theory when I see it backed up by Korean or Western intelligence. In the mean time its a wild conspiracy theory backed up by literally nothing.Also what tribes?  Theres no tribes that live there.  Modern Manchus are legally defined as an amalgamation of Qing Manchu Bannermen Chinese Bannermen and some Mongols.  They arent legally divided by tribes.  The only thing that closely resembles tribes exist hundreds of miles to the north around the Amur in Russia yet these are distinct ethnic groups not tribesAlso how do you get reliable information from  intelligence like the CIA?  Do you even understand what you are saying?Most Koreans are taught this in high school.  I dont think you are an actual Korean citizen in Korea coming from a Korean American who has researched all this from academic publicationsDo you seriously think  years of maps and specially crafted dynastic histories is nothing?  Do you think the history of ethnic Koreans in China means nothing? Ethnic Koreans in China have to be removed from the land they have been living on for generations and their livelihoods completely changed for the sake of this new park according to the articleYeah China has a right to completely go against the wishes of and screw over Tibetans and Uyghurs on their own land who arent recent migrants like Yanbian Koreans.

11166204,0,t3_5zcjfs,To be honest and bracing for downvotes Im one of those people who dont consider most gyopos truly Korean. Korea is a smalldense country with a very homogeneous culture. For anyone  and under this means everyone who went to school in Korea basically share the same experiences. Its like only s kids will understand this except it applies to every generation and  of the people within each generation. Throughout identityforming years you all look alike wear the same clothes have the same haircuts watch the same TV shows listen to the same music eat the same  for  on your way home from school get excited when mom makes the same  for dinner etc. unless youre in the bottom  of the population economically. In my experience even the top  of the kids will share the same experience for the most part. Throw in the prevalence of Internet culture and this intensifies x. Up to a certain age if you cannot sympathize with these experiences youre pretty much an outsider. The culture is homogeneous to the point that most Koreans cannot visualize the extreme culture gap that exists in a place like the US. I would imagine this gets diluted as people age and have different life experiences but youre not that age yet.This is more personal but it doesnt help most gyopos I meet either hate Korea or are obsessed with Korean pop culture.,korea,dexoeen,24,t5_2qiog

I explained this in two comments and gave you examples and everything but nothing helps. Yes youre  correct when you say he wasnt calling the kids or white people themselves nazis BUT he is saying that anybody who looks like me is naziwhite looking which implies that white people look as white as a nazi. I told you several times nazi is just the nword for Europeans. If I would say you look niggerblack then I also dont call you a nigger but am saying that you are as black as a nigger. Saying he meant white as the ideal race of the nazis is very farfetched and even if he did mean that it is still racially insulting.

11735357,0,t1_dgq6prk,Actually I do have proof for my statement about conservatives funding North Korea more than liberals refer to this link below.Kim Yeong Sam YS gave  trillion won  billion to North Korea Lee Myung Bak gave . billion Kim Dae Jung gave . billion Roh Moo Hyun gave .billion.Kim Yeong sam and Lee Myung Bak are both conservative party presidents for Yeong Sam the group he was affiliiated with New Korea Party made the basis for modern day conservatives of Hanara and Saenuri party and they gave more money to North Korea than Kim Dae Jung or Roh Moo Hyun  the liberals.Im also going to copy and paste my argument from before I answered this question too many timesgtFormer Hanara Party congressman i.e. conservative have confirmed with the Korean Broadcasting System KBS at the time of the article in  The Lee Myung Bak administration spent more than the previous liberal administration. Ironically Lee is also probably the most proU.S. korean president in the past few decades. In later years after his term it was been confirmed that Lee Myung Bak as indeed spent more on aid to North Korea than Roh Moo Hyun.I dont own newspapers from before but YS Kim Yong Sam spent more than Kim Dae Jung and Roh Moo Hyun combined according to the Ministry of Unification . YS was a conservative party member as well and is mentioned in the second article.I cant find TOTAL aid amount under Park Geun Hyes administration.. My argument is largely based on the report by UPI that Park spent  more in total aid to North Korea in her first year compared to Lee Myung Bak but I cant find any information about total aid to this day. Im not sure if there was a formal report about the conclusion yet considering she got impeached. She however DID spend less on humanitarian aid to North Korea but humanitarian aid traditionally counted a small part of the total aid to North Korea business tourism constructioninfrastructure etc. for all presidents liberal or conservative. So that data is inconclusive.Seeing as how I cant find the full data for Park Geun Hye across her incomplete term it might be that she spent much less in her later years and overall spent less. Maybe. Parks administration doesnt like posting financialsocial statistics like these. So I acknowledge the possibility that I might be wrong there.Still Lee Myung Bak did spend more than either Kim Dae Jung or Roh Moo Hyun and Kim Yeong Sam was worst of all. Lee and YS are both conservative party presidents.Also you can look it up in korean and search the news outlets  they covered it before in their reports. In total the conservatives gave more money to North Korea than the liberals. I dont think even mainstream conservative politicians deny that anymore they just never mention it and only point out the money the liberals gave.As for Yeongpyeondo you DO realize Yeongpyeondo was almost LMBs last straw right? He gave the order to launch FK planes but the US detachment in South Korea launched  fighters in response possibly to shoot them down they werent going to NK borders or Yeongpyeondo so intercepting ROK fighters is more likely   Obama and Robert Gates admitted in public that they personally forced LMB to stand down and he was pissed about it. He was hardcore proUSA but the US just steamrolled over his judgement and there wasnt anything he could do since he based his international policies by relying on the USA for contracts diplomacy etc. Barring that he did little to nothing to directly handle the NK issue. LMB managed to squeeze some concessions out of it for backing down but South Korea lost a lot more in the form of strategic deterrence development restrictions couldve negotiated a better deal wartime operational control and etc.,korea,dgq8dm3,9,t5_2qiog

They have no regards for international norms or laws and any ruling such as the Phillipines EEZ ruling by the UN is disregarded as propaganda. Why would I vote for a president that opposes THAAD when China is not even a government that can be held accountable to its own people.Yes Korea needs new labor laws that sanction shitty work hours and work culture can definitely be improved on. But this culture will appear only with stiffer competition. The more international companies come in and give better pay and better working hours to Koreans the Korean companies will have to follow or they will start to lose talent. Korean grown companies cannot compete with Samsung so bring Amazon google facebook Deloitte exxon apple whatever company to compete with samsung.How do you attract investment? Not with a huge tax increase to companies.,korea,dgtoyq8,5,t5_2qiog

But today in an interview trump casually said that a major war was a possibility. wtf? the administration is crazy ,korea,dgusiip,2,t5_2qiog
11777755,0,t1_dgv1dcv,Because the US was the one who first proposed the FTA agreements AND THAAD in the first place and lobbied for years to push it through.It benefits mainly the USA FTA does offer gains to both parties but also restricts South Koreas tradeexport options. Another fun little fact Trump seems to have forgotten.,korea,dgv1nwa,7,t5_2qiog

Nothing different in the sauna. Theyre there to relax and clean themselves and then go home.Most sleeping rooms will be loud though. You need to bring your own earplugs or be drunk and exhausted enough that youll drop into deep sleep after you come out of the baths. ,korea,dgxy98x,2,t5_2qiog
