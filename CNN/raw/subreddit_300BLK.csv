172219,0,t3_1w0kv0,OP I have this barrel hereI like it.  Suppressor stays on nice and snug.Just remember to pay attention to what size gas tube you need.  That barrel needs a pistollength gas tube... a normal carbinelength gas tube will be way too long.,300BLK,cey1qyj,1,t5_2vmj1

2115092,0,t1_cl89xx3,Im somewhat new myself but Ive done a fair amount of reading here and there. AAC developed the  blackout AR so their configurations probably have quite a bit of testing put into them.Carbinelength gas on barrels over  and pistollength otherwise. You can run carbinelength gas on a  barrel but it may not fully cycle subsonic ammo without a suppressor.Pistollength gas on a  barrel seems to be a sweet spot for cycling anything and as the barrel length goes up it may be slightly overgassed with supersonic loads. An adjustable gas block can be used to cut the gas back a little but may require tweaking when switching between supers and subs.My plan is at this point is to mostly shoot subs or heavier slower supers and not mess with the gas just yet. This is just for range work though. Hunting generally requires high velocity for proper expansion not to mention range so rules out subs.YMMV.,300BLK,cl8o9ys,1,t5_2vmj1
2322073,0,t1_clypreu,I intend on using this for both so I figure the additional length would add some velocity for supers. Also I dont wantlike quad rails and a majority of hand guards for an  barrel are exactly that. Can find a plethora of  hand guards that match my preference and that would work well with a . barrel.

2322203,0,t1_clyq06f,Cant go wrong with a select or ultramatch. I have the select on this rig and its great. Youre really not going to get much added velocity over . to ..

5174259,0,t1_cv9lug5,Since I started reloading I learned about doing an ammo test in the chamber to make sure it goes in and out properly. I was able to drop in an empty case and it would fall out no issues. Once I had a bullet loaded to spec gr. . OAL and gravity fed it into the barrel it would get stuck. The round I chambered from a magazine had to be extracted wasnt stuck too bad. They honed it and said it is in within specs because while headspacing with the PTG gauge the go gauge went in but was tight. It was said that the gauge and ammo now go in smoothly. My subsonic rounds are speced at . which is probably what is giving me the issues now.,300BLK,cv9osh3,1,t5_2vmj1
