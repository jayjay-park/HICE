10655032,0,t3_5qijul,Im getting into it. I dont know if Ive found a bug or not though. When you pick something up with the controller the ui just closes when I hit A to take a single item. The item stays on the ground or in container. But if I hit X to take all items that works. Any ideas folks?,subterrain,ddezggn,1,t5_3bx87
