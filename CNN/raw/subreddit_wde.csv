I know its silly but its amazing how things change with it. Thank you for not watching right now. War Eagle my asshole friend.EDIT  Did you decide to watch the last few minutes? ASSHOLE!!!! Its amazing how the defense can play so poorly the whole game then bring it together and play great at the end and the offense fucks it twice. Although I think that first fumble was BS I think CAP had control on the ground.,wde,clwz8r2,4,t5_2s81c
2367641,0,t1_cm3zpka,My point is that they did understand the defense. They were in the right position at the right time. When the time came to make a play they just didnt. Our roster isnt barren but its not head and shoulders above the rest of the SEC. On paper only counts for so much. Even on paper were at best equals with half a dozen SEC programs. None of our juniors will be drafted above the th IMO if they declare to include Williams and Coates. Dismukes is probably the highest drafted guy on out team.There are some definite talent shortfalls right now. Im not willing to bail on the coaches when theyve only had one full year to recruit their systems. ,wde,cm4ckzo,2,t5_2s81c

I would have loved for him to stay but he has given all that anyone could ask for and then exceeded it. He really has nothing left to play for in College. ,wde,cn9xljd,1,t5_2s81c

5510055,0,t3_3qg9gz,Every fan base has outliers unfortunately.Whenever Ive seen this happen at just about any stadium with any team the overwhelming majority of people are supportive of the injured player. SEC fans I feel are more Football Smart than other conferences so they tend to be more understanding of these sorts of things and always wish the player the best. Student sections can get a bit over the top but a lot of those times the kids are there to be drunk in public not necessarily to enjoy the sport and appreciate that other much bigger kids are putting their lives and futures on the line every time they strap up their chin strap. ,wde,cwfyk5n,1,t5_2s81c

8344368,0,t3_4tulx7,I dont think LSU goes . Its conservative play calling at its finest. They had the flash at the beginning of last year but once people started shutting down Fournette they had nothing else to back it up with. Their defense will be stout again but unless they find an offense besides Fournette I dont see it happening.     Im not predicting them like last in the West or anything but I think  rd in the West is gonna be more accurate.     Edit Didnt even see Vandy up there.  is a bold call. Im high on them this year and even Im thinking  wins and a bowl game is the ceiling. Who knows though so long as one of those five losses are Auburn they can win it for all I care. ,wde,d5kllxq,3,t5_2s81c

8552140,0,t1_d6ajfuj,I agree. The loss of Jovon and the shaky QB situation along with a difficult schedule are the only things keeping us from being true contenders. Well be as good on defense as we have been this decade and were an average Gus offense  points a game away from being great. However an offense resembling last years seems more likely than one resembling   . I see  wins. Id love nothing more than to be wrong about the offense though!,wde,d6al9xl,2,t5_2s81c
8639266,1,t1_d6li747,I dont know about that.  A good coach anywhere could have been a contender with Cam.  Ill give him the  season though.  Still I see a lot of things that concern me.  The amount of injuries can be a sign of insignificant conditioning.  Thats on the coaching staff.  Indecision in choosing a QB is also a concern.,wde,d6limhr,-3,t5_2s81c

8848002,0,t1_d7b6ij5,Gus is a really good OC but the guy is clearly clueless at HC....

Ive been an auburn fan my whole life I have continued to wear my auburn jerseyhoodie rather we went  or . And I understand what you mean by the weight difference it makes a lot of sense now that you put it that way. I would love for auburn to come out and beat bama I do believe it can be done but if JJ is the one starting he has to play a perfect game. He has to play like the person we thought he was last year if that makes sense. Rather we win or lose its been a good season nonetheless we were predicted to be th in the conference lol... I guess we will see Saturday but Ill still be cheering them on no matter who plays QB. Anyways War Eagle! Hoping for the best ,wde,daaj200,1,t5_2s81c
