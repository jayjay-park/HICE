10982029,0,t3_5s72l9,You are absolutely right. There is no way that hes not treating her like crap. I really didnt like her before she came First Lady but that video clip taken during the ceremony was like a slap in the face. The way her expression melted when he turned away was heartbreaking. I realized at that moment that she was trapped.Since then I have heard so many people say why did she marry him then? I absolutely understand why because a narcissist is a master of courtship whether it be in love friendship or business.My theory is that when the bus tape leaked she said she wanted a divorce after the election. Then he won what is she going to do now? Staying in NYC is obviously best for Melania and if it keeps him unhappy then I dont mind paying the extra taxes to keep her there.,FreeMelania,decs18d,1,t5_3iqqn
