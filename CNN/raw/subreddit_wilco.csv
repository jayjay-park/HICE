4730940,0,t1_ctqfjws,Yeah its not written by Tweedy though which is why I feel the lyrics were really just added to a cool jam. Dont get me wrong it sounds amazing but I think a great song ties together the lyrics and the music. I dont feel the connection between the two,wilco,ctqvku8,1,t5_2rc07
4775154,0,t3_3dr1my,I think they literally thoughthmmm... all the internet cares about is cats and Star Wars....Fuck it well show em I mean the whole package is a kind of troll gold in terms of marketing.

7307859,0,t3_4fg583,Youve already started where Id recommend starting YHF and Summerteeth. Theres no wrong way to listen  its interesting to go to Being There and listen to where they came from and how they developed and then going to AGIBSBSWilco etc to see how they are evolving now. Personally Id go Being There then AGIB,wilco,d28uqvn,2,t5_2rc07

11607081,0,t1_dgbgus2,Whats your  is great but its not quite what I looking for. It doesnt have Star Wars or Schmilco and the songs are simply in chronological order and dont fade into each other. I really like how the songs all connect to each other on Mike Alpha Foxtrot their rarities collection. ,wilco,dgbo7w2,1,t5_2rc07
