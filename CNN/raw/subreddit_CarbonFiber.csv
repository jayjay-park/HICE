656705,0,t3_21o6te,Never understood using CF as an impact part....looks obviously.  If the WHOLE thing was made from CF it could be light.   Adding jsut the front in CF doesnt do much except add some rigidity.  In this case I guess that would be good for impact.  Still...itll hurt if it breaks IF that piece is even strong enough to act as a strength member.,CarbonFiber,cgex0z1,4,t5_2tl9p
2765029,0,t1_cnhl9ji,If you replace the ton bridge section with one that is  you can haul  more tons of cargo!   Never said make the ship  carbon.  You cant have carbon decking that would hold up to the abuse etc,CarbonFiber,cnidfrv,1,t5_2tl9p
2982264,0,t1_co6gqho,Alright that post makes a lot more sense than the first one. Couldnt tell from the first one go right ahead  Im still looking for road shoe recommendations. I got some spds handed down from a friend looking for an upgrade. What pedals and shoes can you recommend?,CarbonFiber,co73kyz,1,t5_2tl9p
3624532,0,t1_cq5dgbv,Wheels are VERY tricky.   I would do a ton of research on it first.  I dont know much more than watching videos of them being made.  What would this be for?It LOOKED straight going in now it has a xcm wave.  HA.  ,CarbonFiber,cq5f9bk,2,t5_2tl9p
3630807,0,t1_cq5tpd3,Im not an expert but if you were to do it this way Id score the pipe for better adhesion and use the hell out of the heat gun to get the fabric around the pipe. Possibly huge pleats to get the bagging all the way up against that tight seam.,CarbonFiber,cq651vk,2,t5_2tl9p

6121864,0,t1_cyhtfqf,Possibly.  Mostly anything can be replaced.   Full carbon sports cars have everything even simple mounting platesbrackets made from CF.   Bucket seats as well etc.   In the end its all down to two things Cost materials and production and the lack of want from manufactures to change their ways.  Its like why American steel died off.....we didnt want to change our ways of production while chinese steel makers were quick to upgrade for efficiency.  Car manufactures have the equipment and knowledge for metalwork so they stick with it.Soon.....soon we will be doing more in composites.   Right now Im working for the NHSTA on testing BPillers made from all carbon.  They want proof its better so until they know they might not certify auto makers to use composites in main structures.,CarbonFiber,cylhqch,2,t5_2tl9p
7966963,0,t3_4obn3i,How its made had a good episode that featured carbon fiberepoxy layups. Cant for the life of me remember what they were building. Basically there are a few basics youll need vacuum pump resin epoxy or polyester table or mold vacuum bag and bag stackpeel ply perf film air flow media and the cloth of choice. There are multiple methods of lamination tho as beginner you may wish to start with wet layup. If you already possess the skills to toolbuild your own molds youre half way there. Also remember that whatever surface you laminate to has to have some kind of release agent so that your part comes off the tool wax pva or Teflon filmAs far as vendors try to find a local fiberglass supply store as youll only find good deals online in bulk. If you know anyone in the aerospace or marine industry they may be able to sell you small batches,CarbonFiber,d4bk8z5,1,t5_2tl9p
9199671,0,t1_d8hvwry,I might try out a test piece with some sanding. But the melting possibility gives me the idea that maybe i can use solvent to melt the pvc purpose to get the cf to stick that way then epoxy too. Its really for cosmetic purposes on the outside and inside of a box.,CarbonFiber,d8i4jts,1,t5_2tl9p
