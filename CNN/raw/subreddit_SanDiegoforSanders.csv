7097830,0,t3_4crw40,Also if you have any questions feel free to ask. Ill do my best to give a concise summary in this comment. My name is Justen and Im the current Vice President of UCSDs Tritons for Bernie club. Were working with former staffers who are VERY talented with experience from states such as Nevada Alaska Minnesota and various others in getting this office set up. These former staffers have their own PAC similar to the NNU Nurses Union and thus we can contribute money to them and they will set up a fully functional and efficient volunteer office for Bernie. Id estimate that aside from whats currently raised on the ActBlue counter  we have around .k  k in pledges. Id roughly guess that having k before starting the office up would put us in a comfortable area. If you or anyone you know has the means to make a donation please do so and share with others! Thanks everyone! ,SanDiegoforSanders,d1kwr8c,3,t5_3a4zp
