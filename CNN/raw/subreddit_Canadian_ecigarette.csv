483005,0,t3_1zk9t1,Just like everyone else I reccomend pretty much anything from Innokin. I have the MVPv and its awesome solid  hours of battery with heavy vaping . volt and. w increment power control snazzy blue LED numbers. If you dont mind a box mod which is surprisingly comfortable to use I would grab an MVP. If the form factor is an issue Id say an SVD. Theyre pretty big in  mode but are decently sized in  mode. And you have more choice in battery with the SVD because the MVPs battery is built in.,Canadian_ecigarette,cfv65yg,1,t5_2yvrn
599380,0,t3_210biu,If you mean  pure VG theyll be hard to find since most of the flavour extracts are made with PG as a base. Many people with PG sensitivity get by alright with regular juices mixed at a VG blend still a bit of PG from the flavouring but I havent heard too many issues.At www.vapornorth.com you can choose to have a VG blend weve also been working on some nonPG flavourings recently theyre currently being tested with people who have irritation to PG. Whether or not theyll go live for sure I cant say but youre not alone in your struggle. Ill keep you in mind if they do go through but the best advice is to try the  VG blends with regular flavouring and see if they still cause irritation.Hope this helps!,Canadian_ecigarette,cg8eimw,4,t5_2yvrn

The latest round of price hikes and restrictions on contraband smokes are going to be counter productive. The cost rising so high that people will be forced to the black market. The breaking point if it hasnt already been crossed is upon us as it occurred in the s and the gov had to reduce prices just to fight contraband. ,Canadian_ecigarette,ci6931e,3,t5_2yvrn

Smaller boxes shipped regular USPS mail usually go through without a hitch. It helps if the vendor understands the risks of shipping to Canada and labels the boxes accordingly. A friend also orders lots of juice from the US and has only ever had one shipment seized. It was a  juice order but he ended up getting a refund from the vendor.Its not a large risk and at worst youll get a refund from the vendor when they get the package back.,Canadian_ecigarette,ckg8j40,3,t5_2yvrn

2652924,0,t1_cmyen8p,gtAt www.vapornorth.com we put the  flat rate shipping into effect for all orders a few months ago. Expensive shipping was a huge issue at the time and still is so we wanted to see if flat rate shipping really was something that people would respond to. What weve found is that our business didnt see much of a rise in traffic but we had a huge hit to our profits.gt For us doing  flat shipping its not uncommon that well get an order for just a single bottle of eliquid to try out our brand. If were charging   for that bottle of eliquid and someone chooses the  flat shipping  and shipping was the lowest at   and then well even say the  for the bottle was entirely profit for arguments sake on that order we made . Now from that  we have to pay for our employees our location our website every expense we have as a business.It is pretty grim!  flat rate might be too good an offer perhaps set a limit to at least  or so? I find that psychologically anything under  is an impulse buy for for me. I dont give it much thought before ordering. But over that I have to consider if its gonna go well with my budget lol.For example last week I ordered Covals FOTW just because its  and I had someone coming from the US.

3998521,0,t3_3697xz,Ive only tried the Atlantis and the Subtank. Here are my thoughtsPros   Vapor production It produces a lot of vapor for what it is.Cons   Flavor  I dislike the flavor profile they give. I think its because the coil heads are not concave. Same can be said about the Subtank RDA base. Its better than the coils but still far far from a Kayfun.  Airflow I dislike how they give you all the options for a huge airflow yet do not provide tight ones. When I played with the Subtank Mini I would close down half of the smallest hole. I think  this makes it a bad starter device as smokers usually like a tighter draw.  Security I dislike the idea of selling someone a starter kit with a . ohm coil. I think it makes the new vapors skip a step in security and knowledge. Ive had cases of people buying an ego battery as a backup for their Subtanks.I think Subohm tanks are a trend. They are not for everyone not for me at least Ill stick to my other RTAsRDAs. I really hope it will end soon because it is pushing people to buy more powerful devices without considering their safety.

4040541,0,t1_crfxd30,Silica doesnt catch fire at higher temperatures and if youre using it then its advised that you should give it a vicious dry burn preferably with a butane torch to clean it off. Its why they used it for both tests because with enough wattage and insufficient wicking you can overheat ejuice with it.  Cotton combusts and fairly easily too so you couldnt really do this experiment without getting very different results.  Its a demonstration of how with a simulated condition that would never occur in real life they were able to achieve a specific scary result. They couldnt have done this with cotton because if you take a second draw on a cotton wick that has insufficient wicking at a high wattage then it would destroy the wick before it was able to combust the propylene glycol.  The silica wick was a mandatory part of the first experiment because they were essentially vapourizing the VG while combusting the PG which results in tons of formaldehyde.  Couldnt achieve that result with cotton.,Canadian_ecigarette,crguowd,3,t5_2yvrn

4491963,0,t3_3cm4rr,Ive never tried your brand but I would say to support your customers as long as theyre making an informed decision. Full disclosure of your findings published on the pages where they can buy the juice is more than sufficient in my opinion.As for reformulating if its something you want to do its fine. Just keep in mind that butyric acid is horrible vile stuff. Many people are very sensitive to it and the threshold between a useful I was going to say pleasant but I just cant note and the smell of puke is different for different people. Most v flavourings substitute butyric acid for diacetyl or acetyl propionyl. Most reviews of those flavourings that Ive read are quite negative and I cant disagree personally.As an aside I find these ECTA standards and requirements to be premature and unhelpful to the community. I know of no actual science behind their various thresholds for diketones in juice nor any evidence that those thresholds actually help to protect anyone from... anything. It really looks like they pulled some nice round numbers and said oh that looks good and that was that. Considering that diketones havent even been brought up as an issue in the last draft of proposed legislation I read which was a while ago so correct me if that has changed it seems we have a trade organization trying to police something that even Health Canada hasnt touched.I have serious doubts about ECTA.,Canadian_ecigarette,cswvetz,0,t5_2yvrn

4602057,0,t1_ctanyxv,Its not just the difference in ingredients themselves but the actual flavor mixtures. Some people enjoy the discount US mixes but I find they taste no better than the overpriced Flavor Crafters here in Canada. Just because they are high rated and hugely successful does not mean its any good. Tim Hortons is beloved by most and hugely successful but their coffee is still swill. You are right there is a hole in the Canadian vaping market for a discount juice vendor to move into. We could use a Timmys or McEliquid style vendor that just shits out single note flavors. A final thought to consider though is the size of our market. Were a fraction of the size of the US. A lot folks are still under the belief that nicotine in ejuice is illegal. That discount ejuice vendor is going to have difficulty making ends meet when they cannot push enough volume to compensate. Combine that with the horsecrap that is Canada post charging  for an express package from BC to Ontario. ,Canadian_ecigarette,ctaoe6h,1,t5_2yvrn

4615214,0,t3_3e789r,So i started to write this and then i blacked out... so let me try that again... If you want to give it a lounge feel put in one of those coin operated Kureg machines. Let people have a fresh single cup brew. Most importantly if you get around indoor vaping for testing juice use good hw. I am going to refuse testing out of a anything less than a nautilus. You could also have weekly events for different enthusiasts. Start some form of vaping advocacy from your shop. Its not a revenue generator but if people know coming to your shop they will get news and calls to action to protect vapers rights it might be worth more than a points program.

4673022,0,t3_3et4hx,The throw away style giveaway had to be the worst part of all in my opinion. They were throwing glass bottles into the crowd at least half of them broke LOL. Also I saw all the guys at the front with like  freebies and no one else had anything. Also I was at the back part of the stage and literally th of the stuff given away was thrown to the back of the stage where there were an equal amount of people.Also hugely disappointed in Kick Ash Vapes for using this event to sell highly overpriced goods such as a Sigelei  for  and no deals on juice. Same goes with AceVaper selling premiums for . at a convention.Some good points were VapeMeets  bottles and DashVapes  flash sale. I also picked up a Vicious Ant Phenom for  bucks which is normally . Evaperated was great to see but they were selling their juice for the same price as online so that was kind of a drag.I never got to try the Quebec e juice but Im not a huge fan of tobacco vapes. Though I really didnt like how they blatantly used Monte Cristos logo for their juice. We need to mature as an industry.If youre going to host a booth at a convention of this magnitude offer good prices. Some of the things I saw particularly from Ace Vaper and Kick Ash Vapes really sucked. As a Fort Erie local Kick Ash is the closest BampM to me and theyve lost all respectable business from me.,Canadian_ecigarette,ctjl35b,2,t5_2yvrn

4746065,0,t1_ctsl0lk,Incorrect   Health Canada released an advisory about electronic smoking products that has been falsely interpreted as a Ban and it is where the myth that ecigs are banned and illegal. In addition to the advisory Health Canada regularly justifies its position on ecigs by stating that products containing nicotine are regulated under Schedule F Prescription drug of the Food and Drugs Act. Specifically the regulation statesNicotine and its salts for human use exceptin natural substancesin the form of a chewing gum containing  mg or less of nicotine per dosage unitin the form of a transdermal patch with a delivery rate of  mg or less of nicotine per dayin a form to be administered orally by means of an inhalation device delivering  mg or less of nicotine per dosage unit orin the form of a lozenge containing  mg or less of nicotine per dosage unitSection d directly relates to electronic cigarettes as they deliver nicotine orally by means of inhalation. This means that so long as the ecigarette delivers mg or less of nicotine per dosage unit it is exempt from Schedule F regulation. On a electronic cigarette the dosage unit is only  puff because the unit stops working after the power button is let go. The user is not required to take a second puff so  dose is only  puff. If a user is using a bottle of Gold Seal eJuice with the highest level of nicotine at mg per bottle in a CE ecig then at  inhales per mL of liquid the user would be inhaling only .mg of nicotine per dose puff which is well below the permitted mg per dose.,Canadian_ecigarette,ctssbgy,9,t5_2yvrn

Some note its got a coughsyrup like taste and smell initially but rounds out to a sweet syrup like taste with time. All the flavors you mention besides Cobblestone have it but its only really pronounced in Runny Runny and Triple P and Country Faire this gives them a brown color. Its one of my favorite ingredients since its got a fantastic taste after a time.,Canadian_ecigarette,cwidp6s,2,t5_2yvrn

5601824,0,t3_3rcts7,I just popped one of these into my atlantis and ho lee shit Im getting flavor from this thing like Id get from my drippers. The only thing I did notice is that the coil housing is two separate pieces given the way the atlantis is built if not careful the coil housing could separate allowing the glass and mouthpiece to come undone from the bottom... Spilling juice everywhere. BUT that has not happened yet and Im loving the flavor and the amount of vapor it produces. I hear they last longer as well.

5605805,0,t1_cwrlpsn,If you compare it to something like wind turbines the response is the exact opposite from the government. Although their studies ended up finding nothing there were mass complaints about the health effects of wind turbines and the government turned a blind eye for a solid decade while they went up. There has been no real concerns from citizens about the health effects of vaping only big industry like tobacco stirring the pot. Even then most people and businesss still dont care about the regulations. So whats concerning is you have one industry making money for the government with health claims being ignored for a decade only to find there were no health issues and another industry losing the government money with no claims to ignore thats getting banned with no studies. Thats concerning.The regulations are only going to get worse once people accept the current forms of them as long as the government is losing money. So that mL bottle of juice you might be paying  for very well could end up being twice that once the government taxes it for health reasons that youve mostly accepted already by not making a stink about the new current laws.,Canadian_ecigarette,cwryd48,1,t5_2yvrn

Menage a trois devils pudding gluttony and lust are the  I got and theyre all good. Id say the menage is the best with the touch of cinnamon.    Surprisingly I didnt get any uturn I imagine its because VaperBox actually sells that brand and would run through the samples fast? I have bought a few of their juices though they were all decent simple flavours. The melon one tasted like ChapStick to me but my sister loves it....     I havent tried cosmic fog outside of a BampM tester so cant really say much about them. That seems like an awesome price for space jam! Even the Americans call them pricy hehe.     uliquidejuice has a Reddit account but they dont seem to use it.

6159690,0,t1_cypi7p3,Thank you for a thorough review! Ill try to address all of your points I designed the website on a  Macbook and havent seen it on a larger screen yet. Ill have to see it on a friends desktop and then Ill take it from there. Im not quite sure what you mean could you post a screenshot? The Sample Pack on the homepage is the only quick buy product the remaining individual juices are simply short cuts. Weve considered adding a quick buy to all of the juices but we found that it makes the homepage really messy.  Photos are definitely coming once we get new bottles in and get a good camera. Having different bottle options as with different nicotinePGVG options creates a crazy amount of complexity and is not something that we can support at the moment. Every time we add a different option it increases the SKU count by  or  depending on what you add. Great suggestion though and something we want to incorporate in the future. Good idea! A photo would be nice to add. Another great idea! Added a mailto tag. I see what you mean but dont you think itll make it more messy? Shopify doesnt support anchor links so we gotta do it through HTML. Good idea well add it in the next day or so. Which phone do you have? More nicotine options are coming soon with more size options a bit later on. Once we get more flavours well let people select which juices they want.Best of luck on the giveaway!   ,Canadian_ecigarette,cypskh3,2,t5_2yvrn

You can self clean them too basically every  tanks when youre empty you press and just blow in it a couple times to clean it. Vapor production is okay the way the coil is made airflow is a little bit restrictive but I like it this way. Lung hits are fairly comfortable with just the right amount of resistance. Comparable to an atlantis v in between the biggest and second biggest airflow approximatively. Be sure to flood the crap out of the coil when its brand new.

Mind you thats in the DIY world But seriously  a day or two is nuts thats more expensive that actual smoking. anyone going through that level of consumption really has to either increase their nic concentration thereby vaping less OR make their own juice where ml costs around .

6594516,0,t1_d01eudh,As you can see most are thinking of e juice and responding according to that.  I would say remove the word e liquids from your original post. And maybe add DIY in bold at the start of the text   So people know right away. As VanGoVapes said above...you will find there are a few larger DIY retailers who have a pretty good stronghold on the market as well as some smaller DIY retailers some of which frequent this sub regularly. I think as long as you source good quality nic the majority of flavour companies etc you have as good a shot at making it as anyone even if you are coming late to the party.  I think DIY is only going to get bigger as the vaping demographic grows. You certainly have stiff competition though already quite entrenched. Good luck!EDIT  Sorry I didnt really answer your question further than the nic and multiple flavour companies   Bottles scales nic tests kits etc.  Most will source this stuff off of Amazon or whatever they can for cheaper pricing than what most are going to retail it at.  Thats where the inventorypricing becomes an issue for you.  If it can be had cheaper elsewhere it will be bought elsewhere. If its only a few dollars difference then many will add it to their base order with one company rather than deal with multiple shipping costs companies etc.  So if you want to offer all the supplies it has to be competitively priced in order to move that product  ,Canadian_ecigarette,d01fdwg,2,t5_2yvrn

Great taste clouds and its a tank so no redrippy drips.Having both is optimal. For when youre at home gotta love the RDA. Busy? Tank.,Canadian_ecigarette,d03065p,4,t5_2yvrn

6787331,0,t3_48n0e6,Clones can be as good if not better than authentics. You just have to be wise and patient!My personal rulesguidelines about clones  Made of  gt  gt SS. If it only states SS Ill probably end up throwing it away if it feels like shit. Sometimes you can tell the SS is crappy and I personally do not trust it I could be wrong but I dont trust China. If a  option exists I spend the  more and get it.  Any copper inside the chamber  Garbage! Ill skip the atty. Main reason why I never got a Kennedy. Even the authentic has copper. I dont care how clean you state your copper is copper is copper it patinas! No way Im vaping with this inside!  Peek insulator I couldnt care less. I dont vape acids and dont vape at W. Unless there is a hard short for an extended period the insulator will never melt. I have over  atties and only melted the insulator on my authentic KF when I left my rDNA upside down autofiring for like  minutes.  Plastic Never next to the coil. I remember trying a plastic chamber for my KF lite. Repeated heating changed the plastics from see through to white from melting it bit by bit.  TobeccoHcigarEhPro.... These companies have very small factories if any and subcontract their workorders from other manufacturers. The difference is usually the quality control on the device. For example Hcigar used SGS for quality control. The manufacturer gives the goods to SGS which inspects it and if it clears then they are branded Hcigar. This is why branded clones are more expensive and sometimes are exactly the same as the  ones on FT. This does not necessarily mean the quality is better. HCigar quality went down the shitter before they stopped selling clones.,Canadian_ecigarette,d0lmr48,1,t5_2yvrn

Of course as with all my unregulated mods its mosfet protected and this one is parallel so I can get a little more enjoyment out of these piddly s.

Were working on a video for that process that outlines how its done at our distribution centre and our retail stores.Just to give you a bit of a process flow to ease your mindEverything is nicd via digital dosage pumps that are accurate to the   . We can actually guarantee with  certainty that any juice coming out of any of our facilities is nicd to the strength that is mentioned on the label.Weve recently switched to USA Liquid Nicotine as well this Nicotine is similar to TruNic in the USA. It is grown in Georgia extracted in Georgia and processed in Georgia. The only liquid nicotine on the market  that is manufactured  in the USA.Prior to that we used NicSelect which was another trusted brand of Nicotine.We do this to avoid issues at the border and to be able to offer the product reliably and to make the juice available in Canada at an affordable price.This process also allows us to never be out of stock on any specific nic strength as long as we have the base in stock as well as allowing us to offer any juice in a mL unicorn etc If you have any other questions feel free to ask! ,Canadian_ecigarette,d1ks9ms,3,t5_2yvrn

7619114,0,t1_d387y6e,Look buddy I gave you constructive criticism not insults so when you start a video with fuck you do you think Im going to watch it? Im not spending another  minutes of my time watching bad content just because you think for some reason that you are correct and the hundreds of other comments Ive seen regarding the griffin are wrong.Dont spam your videos here with click bait titles and terrible content if youre not willing to accept any tips youre given. Is this how you think youre going to get those sponsors you are begging for?I genuinely tried to offer advice I even searched and found a nice cheap piece of equipment for you because content can be improved and I hoped I could help you out. The correct response is not to link me to your new crappy video hoping to get more views. Stop milking the fact that people dislike your griffin review you know its caused bad opinions and youre trying to bring the same people back through posting multiple videos saying the same thing. Treating viewers like youre better than them is not going to get you anywhere.Good luck with your YouTube career I guarantee I wont be clicking a link to your channel again.,Canadian_ecigarette,d38956e,3,t5_2yvrn

8174329,0,t3_4r9a5u,To make an announcement regarding this news and shed some light on how things have been on our end it is correct that today all packages were sent out via Canada Post. Our original plan was of course to switch with Fedex for this Monday today as I type this and I was on the phone with them Sunday as I wanted to wait for the announcement on Saturday before pulling the trigger. I dont mean of course to suggest that any other vendors were wrong in any way to switch to Fedex preSaturday I just called Fedex the week before and came to an understanding that I could schedule pickups to arrive next business day without any hitches so I made the decision to hold off on making the switch until I could learn more about the current state of the CP strike.On Sunday I planned to have Fedex scheduled starting today but that morning they made their announcement that if they do plan to strike theyll be giving their  hours notice on Wednesday which to my understanding means that all post will be running business as usual throughout this week. I had decided that well switch to Fedex officially Wednesday assuming they do put in their  hour notice and all orders including ones paid for with our  flat rate shipping TuesdayWednesday will ship out as Fedex ground seamlessly following news of the strike.Of course any orders from say Nova Scotia or British Columbia that would take multiple days wont be shipped if they arent scheduled to arrive by this Friday and will instead go out via Fedex asap.uCoolloser youre exactly right that we planned for any packages that get held up for any reason into not making their normal scheduled delivery be resent immediately as Fedex overnight which I had reassured uakghwc of on the phone previous to seeing this thread. Which is likely why he believes you to be an alternate account. You know us well!Like always we constantly put an effort into upkeeping our reputation and will be doing everything we can to make sure that any customer that purchases from us will indeed be a happy customer. Sorry for any concern this may have caused I understand that we could have made a post letting everyone know that wed be holding off on the switch immediately I just hadnt thought about it.Cheers everyoneMark,Canadian_ecigarette,d4zca4o,18,t5_2yvrn

This was a very interesting documentary. Thanks very much for posting it. The UK has gotten it correct.  A country that understands the benefits of having people quit smoking.  Period.  Full stop. Thats what matters.  Getting a generation of smokers to become non smokers.  I wish every country could be so enlightened.
