4505684,0,t1_cswi3yx,Hmmm....I have been doing my own practicing as well. Of course when you go with higher resolutions you need a higher bitrate but i am finding that x does perfectly fine compared to what you claim.I dont mean to be rude but is it possible that you are doing something wrong?Also i find that any video i watch seems washed out if i watch it on MPCHC and not VLC. No settings changed or anything. VLC always looks x better color wise. I just wonder if maybe you are using MPC and associate the washed out color with the codec and not the player.Again just curious. I really like this codec so far. I have not had any of the issues you claim at all yet. Mind you i also use pretty decent source material. Right now i use Handbrake and AviDemux for extra options i cant get ahold of in Handbrake. What programs are you using?edit I am at work right now but when i get home i will put together a small  pack of samples of my work if you wish. ,x265,csylbjo,1,t5_34ag0
