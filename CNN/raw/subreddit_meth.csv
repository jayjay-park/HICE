2883457,0,t3_2r32er,Really guys I went through too many daysand nights wondering what it was all worth. I mean get high as fuck for some time then spend the comedown and the next couple of days kicking myself in the ass. I tried moderation meissner but everyone around me seemed to up the ante EVERY FUCKING TIME! When I would say only weekend and party time occasions my wifeback then gf would go nuts and do it in the car and all kinds of crazy shit. So the environment failed for my moderation. Most importantly tho that spell started on moderation and ended in tears. I didnt do enough time to get clean tho I got out and went to get my head right immediately! So yes to answer the first question I really just outgrew the drug and most of those friends. I just want more out of life. When youre in that lifestyle its all about you only live once party hard! Now I travel see the world took the kid to Disney last year. I guess it served its purposekeep me out of college lol I stay up all night still just mostly playing video gamesmost of my tweak activities I dont have triggers anymore last time I was around it I passed the pipe for people with no intention of hitting that shit true story. Screwredditlol get back on your wagon! It sucks to slip been there too! Just keep busy and dont associate with new tweaker friends.  Its all willpower and we all have some. Are you willing to challenge yourself? Im trying to lose weight now ironically lol chocolate chip cookies right next to me. Its my way prove to myself that im strong. When I quit cigarettes I walked around for a week with a half a pack and an ecig. Its been  months now and no slip in that department. Anyway hope I inspired at least one of you. Sorry to get back so late my job has been crazy busy holla!,meth,cnvuo2t,1,t5_2r9qy

Whenever you get the urge to do meth try to think of it as a separate force that is working against you that you have to overcome rather than as something you need to do because you have an addictive personality. ,meth,ctudxdg,1,t5_2r9qy

9394054,0,t1_d96l49x,Was your mental health worsened after regular use or certain episodes? I am diagnosed depressionanxiety and enjoy my use of drugs. Usually benzos. Just started a bit of meth but now Im reading that a lot of people have developed permanent issues. Thats scary. ,meth,d96rgqm,2,t5_2r9qy

9733170,0,t3_5ej7tj,This guide talks about not redosing and keeping doses small but it doesnt really give the most important reason as to why you shouldnt. The guide says the effects will decrease with more doses later on but that isnt really why you shouldnt take more meth.Dosing more than once after a comedown is extremely dangerous because of the lack of sleep. Its the reason we see meth freakouts cognitive function takes a sharp decline after youre awake more than  hours. Its very very easy to develop excited delirium after  days of staying up tweaking. Youll start to see shadow people at the beginning and wind up with full fledged hallucinations of peoplethings that dont exist. After a couple days awake  a high meth dose people will get the feeling of having infinite energy and the idea that everything is out to get you. Dangerous stuff and its how people wind up restrained in a hospital after being arrested.,meth,dactq9m,3,t5_2r9qy
10099873,0,t1_dbo0r8b,Im coming down off a  day binge nowI guess the moment i realized is just recently when i started pulling out all the stops to try and score again.Like what in the actual fuck.I should sleep. But all im focused on is trying to get more. Have literally never experienced addiction before so this is rough as hell.,meth,dbo0zmn,2,t5_2r9qy
10151239,0,t1_dajhptx,I agree. Thats a long run straight on my friend Tina. Ur body can only take so much. I use a couple times a week for a couple weeks then take a week off. Meth is so strong and awesome I can see how it got to b everyday. Id say at this point its a fine line between totally ruining ur life and health wich will take years to even make bareable or stop for a while and let ur body rest and recharge. I kno thats a horrible option but its a must if u wanna actually enjoy that shiny wonder. I kno the withdrawal is a bitch but it can only last so long. Get some good bud and enjoy the slow life for a bit. Its helped me tremendously to get through the worst days. I wish u luck bud. B strong and dont giv up. ,meth,dbup5se,1,t5_2r9qy
