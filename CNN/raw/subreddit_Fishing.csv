12061,0,t1_cefmdm6,Im curious about this.   So I bass fish a lot and some off my favorite methods are drop shotting and shake heads.   So l like using  or  lb flourocarbon on my spinning reels.   BUT I hate shelling out the big bucks to replace my flourocarbon all the time.   How long of a leader do you use?  I assume  yards then just back the spool with braid?  Do you use the same lb test braid?Seems like this would save money and time just replacing the leader when you need to.  ,Fishing,ceft34j,1,t5_2qlu4

796242,0,t3_238tc2,My version of mystery tackle is when the water is low I go out in a kayak on lure patrol. I have a whole large tacklebox that consists of found and rehabbed lures and have given away dozens more to kids just starting. Sometimes they need new treble hooks and split rings. But after a relatively short time in fishing whether you are finding lures or just taking advantage of monthly sales the problem becomes too much tackle and too many choices. Sometimes its better just to learn how to use  things well.On his newer Youtube channel Gene Jensen has a Mystery Tackle challenge where he opens a Mystery Tackle box on the water and proceeds to try to catch a LMB on each lure in tbe box. Even though hes on waters known for LMB and a lake hes familiar with he spends most of the time edited out trying to find the fish. So its more about situational knowledge than what hes pitching. He does pretty well with a couple of the lures but theres one that skunks him in a color hes not thrilled with. So my take on that is if the idea is to get  worth of tackle for  but one of the lures is something youd never buy you might do better just hitting the sales and personally picking out what you will use.,Fishing,cgusawb,1,t5_2qlu4

They are smaller fish but are great eating. If you catch one youll catch many as they often swim in large schools.You simply need a highlow righ with either shrimp or bloodworms. Bloodworms seemd to work best when I was there. Try to get out early in the morning on the incoming tide if possible thats when I had the best results. You switch the bloodworms with sand fleas which are everywhere on the outerbanks.. so free bait! and try for pompano but they are mostly found farther down the OB Buxton and south.Otherwise you can fish with a fishfinder rig and try for bluefish drum striper or speckled trout. You may even land a skate or two from the shore with a fishfinder.Final tip your really only going to catch stuff early morning or during the night. I have never had much luck fishing the outer banks during the day.,Fishing,ch3ju5b,2,t5_2qlu4

Sometimes depending on the conditions its night and day between them and other lures. I guide for smallmouth and Ive had days of early spring power fishing where the live target crayfish catches fish  over anything else. Then again losing one is equivalent to losing  other cranks. Also again depending on the conditions theres often a lure working better than the live target. Regardless all I can say is that as a guide the LT crayfish is always in my box. That said this one looks pretty gimmicky to me. Im sure itll catch fish the question is will it catch fish  times better than a  dollar jerk bait?,Fishing,chzt2l7,5,t5_2qlu4

1370134,0,t1_cio05q6,College is an option for us by choice and shouldnt be forced upon us....give it  years and a master degree will not mean anything to anyone as you me and every other kid who was born post cold war to baby boomers or their kids has been tricked into the educational scam that university is becoming.  A TON of the parents from our generation whatever year olds considered a bachelors degree to be the hot shit and in the s and even the early s that shit could get you a solid job.  Sadly education is no longer actually about learning or absorbing and being passionate about the information that you studied.  Its about paying cash or loans off proving yourself to be a useful member to society who can be trusted with large amounts of invisible money all for a validation by a school that you in fact get to make more money than someone without one regardless of if you know jackshit about what you studied.  Say what you want about it but college is not the only option in life and if the kid wants to buy a fuckin boat all props to him.  Sure not the wisest of financial decisions but still how many  year olds have that that much passion that they actually go out work their asses off doing real down to earth and physical work for their money and then put all into something like a fishing boat?  Most  year olds are buying Drake songs on itunes new clothes weed and other shit that gets them nowhere in terms of pursuing a passion.  Maybe this kid is going to become a kickass bass pro or local guide in  the near future?  Maybe not but the pursuit of those would probably be a lot more enjoyable and memorable than simply putting  into school.  Because guess what?  Kids still close to  short from any big degree.....Life is meant to be lived not followed.  Buy a fucking boat while youre a kid and youll remember it for the rest of your life no matter what comes from it.  If I could go back to age  Id sure as shit be working my ass off saving every penny for something that I truly enjoy and can say I love and this doesnt just mean fishing.  Again all just my opinion not trying to be a dick.....but still Im ready for the flak.  Im not against education or any shit like that just HIGHLY opposed to the system that we have now that breeds this mentality in us youth that the only option to save us from a life of squalor and financial sturggle is to give  after all is said and done to a university.  Even community college like what Im doing on rent tuition and living expenses to afford being a student youre going to be putting in closer to  after its all said in done and if you transfer to another school to finish your degree.   tldr HURRRDURRRRR IM A GHEY HIPPIE WIZARD EDUMACATION IS THA DEVIL!EditAgain congrats to the OP.

Super heavy tackle full harness and chair. When the fish attempted to sound they had to stop it. Too many sharks for a long fight. Heavy drag settings supplemented with pressure on the spool from the angler. Tackle and angler pushed to the absolute brink locked in that semisquatting position to put maximum pressure on the fish. Let up on the drag the fish bolts deep and comes up shredded. They had to lock it down never give an inch to win a short but brutal fight in the broiling sun.

1485417,0,t3_2b3y3o,What that dude said. Learn with that thing cranked up and get used to casting first. Once you get that confidence you can start to back off of it more and get further casts. Also it depends on the weight of the bait. A heavier bait I will back off considerably but lighter baits I will up the brakes just a little. Also when you spool line on if braid put the spool in a bucket of water while doin so. This will prevent dig in your line digging into the spool while fighting fish or getting out of a snag.Start practicing with a one ounce cannon ball weight and decrease weight with your comfort level. Its a learning curve but once you get it down its a blast! I rarely birds nest mine anymore but even the pros do that shit so dont beat yourself up!,Fishing,cj2h06r,1,t5_2qlu4

1625484,0,t3_2cxkbp,This time of year find a beach. Any beach. For tackle I recommend a light spinner. I like a Penn SS spooled with lb monofilament on a Hurricane Redbone  rod. Tie a short length  inches of lb fluorocarbon leader to your line. I like the albright special for this connection. Add a  shortshank hook to the end of the leader using a loop knot of your choice. Crimp a  very small splitshot to the line above the leader.Next bait. If you can throw a castnet youre ahead of the game. Take the net and catch some pilchadsgreeniesscaled sardines at the beach. Transfer these into a bait bucket tied to the smallest anchor you can find. Anchor your bucket just past the breaking waves. If you dont know how to throw a net get some live shrimp. Everything else is the same. Anchor it just past the breakers at the beach. Grab your rod and wade out to your bucket. Grab a bait and put it on the hook. If a pilchard hook it through the clear spot in the nose from one side to the other. If a shrimp hook either in the head forward of all the dark spots or in the tail. Fish parallel to the beach in shallow water. Youll probably see snook cruising the beach theyll be just outside the breaking waves. Thigh deep or less.After your cast keep the line tight so you can feel the hit. As your bait gets washed around take up the slack in the line and recast if necessary. When the bait is no longer kicking and frisky replace it with a fresh one.Fishing at dusk and during full moon and new moon tides helps. As does calm surf.I cant guarantee these will be big fish you catch. There will be a few big breeder females cruising but theyre vastly outnumbered by the smaller males. Regardless this is about as close to a sure thing as you get with snook. ,Fishing,cjk235y,3,t5_2qlu4

1634556,0,t3_2d155o,Ok lemme try.  This is for carp my grandfather used to fish with these quite successfully I might add.  Basically the way this worked is that you get bread remove crust mush it together with some sunflower oil until the thing almost like playdoh.  Then you stick that on the spiral and stick the hooks into the bread  sunflower oil thing.  You cast it out and wait.  Apparently carp comes over and sort of starts to suck on the thing swallowing a hook and then you are pretty much done.  Weight under the spiral ensures that when you cast it the bread mess will be on top.  He used to make those themselves using spoon to create the weight and some wire to make spiral. Not sure what it is called here but in Russia this contraption is called  which translates into pacifier because fish sucks on it.  Hope this helps.,Fishing,cjl78oc,1,t5_2qlu4

1816432,0,t1_ck7si8w,Haha thanks. I do alright. What Ive noticed is a couple things that it comes down to. First and foremost...BAIT SELECTION and treatment of the bait. On wide open bites its not that big of a deal but a better bait is going to be picked up faster than a subpar bait. This is more of my technique for sardines rather than anchovies. How I pick a bait is make sure it has no red on its sides or nose what so ever. If I see red  I let it go. Also I have my hook ready to hook the bait when I get to the bait tank. Holding the eye of the hook ready for the bait that I grab. Once I start looking for a bait and find one that I like I hook it at the bait tank. Gently cradling it in the water and then with my right hand hooking the bait thru the nose I dont tend to butt hook sardines very often. Once the bait is on the hook LET GO OF IT. Haha. I see guys all the time white knuckling their bait all the way to the rail. The bait is on a hook its not going anywhere. Let it go and grab the line. The more time your hand is on the bait the less time it will live in the water. On bait  no red if it can be avoided and quickly hook the bait and let it go. For gear  at the beginning of the day or the night before when I rig up I will fluorocarbon EVERYTHING. I dont know what the bite will be like so I just match up fluorocarbon weight to my topshot weight. I might go a bit heavier on the fluorocarbon if I am a bit worried about teeth abrasion. I tend to roll with a  hook. Maybe a  hook if the baits are really big. But honestly I have been of the thought that the smaller I can get away with the better. It allows the bait to swim more naturally.If the birds are an issue or I want to get a bit deeper to fish I have thrown anywhere from an thoz egg sinker on a fly line. ,Fishing,ck82a3v,1,t5_2qlu4

There is nuthin here that he cant get there and the quality will be way better. At the least the stuff they have there will be more specific to his fishin style and where he is fishing. Now if he is a night angler pretty easy. Get him a head lamp. He by all means may already have one but a spare is extremely useful. They are small so packing out an extra one is a nonissue. Plus even less expensive ones can be better then the name brand ones. I have used a Petzl for almost seven years and love it. My buddy however got me an Energizer one from Walmart I think it was twenty bucks. It actually is brighter then my Petzl and I use it when there is no moon out. It has also saved my ass when my Petzl ran outta juice.Also in a symbolic way you will be lighting his path!

2993166,0,t1_co7jbwz,I have a bass pole for bass fishing and a trout pole for trout fishing. I was looking for a longer more sensitive trout pole that could  double as a light tackle LM and SM bass pole. I was more exploring this idea and seeing if anybody had discovered or experienced a pole that could work like this. The plan would be to get something that could handle up to  lb. line ultralightmedium light action? on its top range and  lb on the low end. I would then likely put  or  lb braid on the pole and use  lb fluro leaders for trout and  lb fluro for bass. Basically a  long sensitive trout pole that shouldnt break using lb line hopefully catching at most  lb bass an occasional random walleyehopefully and have enough backbone to set the hook on these bass and walleye. Im not worried about being challenged with lighter than normal tackle for bass. As long it I could have confidence in the backbone to sweep set the hook in a decent bass the most desired part is it being a nicer more sensitive pole that I currently have. ,Fishing,co88n18,1,t5_2qlu4

Every  to  seconds of reeling dip the rod down and see if the line twists up.  If so flip the spool over and reel in again.  After spooling up I like to take the rod out to an open field and pulling out at least the first  yards of line.  With nothing tied to the end of the line I will take a cloth wrap my hand with the cloth then loop the line through kind of half way around my hand then reel the line in using that hand to keep tension on the line.  The goal is to keep the twists out of the line because you have nothing on the end of the line this will occur naturally.Is the line a super braid?  If so you will need about  wraps of monofilament line and to tie the braid to the mono.  If you dont do this the line will likely slip on the spool.,Fishing,cpbr0pz,1,t5_2qlu4

3727867,0,t1_cqfuo2w,I had an ugly stik lite last summer and it was alright but did really lack sensitivity. I also broke it when a guide fell out but I did put that one through hell. Its still a common point of failure on them if you look it up. The GX rod was said to be rather soft in comparison too much so and it has those foam handles.For this summer I picked up an ugly stik elite. Its brand new on the market and an improvement over the other stuff in a number of ways supposedly by listening to user feedback.One of my big complaints about the elite was the cheap ass reel that I got with the combo. I had to use it all summer and I think it lacked a lot of finess to say the least. Im no pro on reels at all so I cant at all comment on their absolut quality but relative to their previous combo reel this one seems to be very acceptable. Its got a real nice smooth feel higher quality built all around and has a fine resolution feel to the drag setting. Seems fairly useful and Im really looking forward to giving it a go.Also I stepped up to  from . but the higher graphite content is apparent and the vibrations can be felt all the way down to my elbow just holdin it. The other major complaint was lack of sensitivity so this is improved as well. I also had that eyelet sleeve fall out and theyve gone to a one piece stamped stainless to preven that.  It seems a bit ligher overall than my older combo setup too which did get tiring after an afternoon on the shore. They say its just as strong overal but Id have to see the data on that. Either way I know how to treat a rod better by now so it wont get the same level of novice abuse.  Point being I think you could seriously consider the new elite combo exactly within your price range and get something seriously decent for it. Ugly stik elite  is what it cost me but Ive seen it onlin for ,Fishing,cqh79tr,1,t5_2qlu4

3954539,0,t3_35ra4h,Its always best to go out with someone else if you are on the water but renting one to see how you like it is a good idea. You can get some great kayaks for not a lot of money if you are patient with Craigslist. I DEFINITELY would avoid trying to take a kayak very far out into the gulf without someone else. But if you are all about nature then theres really nothing better than fishing from a kayak. You can get into places a boat or wading would never take you up in mangrove tunnels and the like. Best advice I can give is to invest in safety gear before fishing gear. Get a good PFD that fits you properly and take the time to learn how to do a wet entry and avoid panic if you flip. ,Fishing,cr71up4,2,t5_2qlu4

I swear I had one on my line before because it was pulling upstream and I had never had something that strong before  I was catfishing one evening using chicken liver and tiger muskie was known to be in the area. It ended up biting through my line after  mins of fighting and I never found out what I had on the line but I like to think it was a tiger muskie. This was in western MD but I now reside in northern UT. By the way never knew this fish was better known as the fish of  casts! Motivates me a bit more to catch one of these bastards.TLDR Thought I had a muskie once but will never know. Fish of  casts? Motivation increase.,Fishing,crboc25,3,t5_2qlu4

4094426,0,t1_crmzjkj,Ah well with freshwater fishing and such they tend to mess up the action of lures. Although this could be offset by tying a leader to each lure which kind of defeats the purpose of easyon easyoff.I use them a bit for bottom fishing rigs and stuff. If youre fishing heavier waters for larger fish I dont see them as that much of an issue.TBH the item you linked Ive never quite seen ones like that. Usually they have a cheap barrel swivel in them too. So Im partial to believe these are larger than what Im thinking and are heavier duty ones for bigger fish.,Fishing,crmznd5,3,t5_2qlu4

4120144,0,t3_37so7t,I would recommend the Daiwa Tatula for the reel. Can be found for  on ebay and its an excellent reel. While the Bass Pro stuff is nice you can get far better equipment for around the same price. A Tatula paired with a  Fishing Omen Black would be a great setup.The Lews LFS is also a great reel. Lews has some of the best reels. Period. For  I would take that over BP stuff any day of the week.I would recommend an LFS or a Tatula paired with a  Fishing Omen Black. Medium moderate for crankjerkbaits heavy fast for jigs worms etc. Medium Heavy for the meat and potatoes style rod. You can use them for a ton of different techniques. However I would recommend you spool your reel with mono line first. Get used to the reel how to cast etc. Then once youre comfortable step up to high quality Flurocarbon. Sunline Sniper is my go to. For braid.. Meh. You dont need it. But if you want it Suffix  is the best out there hands down. I use flurocarbon on almost everything.

I had caught a nice .lb LMB on my fly rod about an hour prior and I thought that was gonna be my biggest of the season up to this point Ive caught only small juveniles. I cast out a little pencil crankbait and got to trolling. Immediately I saw that the line had gotten caught on part of the boat and I stopped to fix it. I heard an enormous splash and saw a big ripple about twenty yards out. I didnt think it was hooked but I quickly untangled my line and set the hook by yanking on the line with my hands. Grabbed the rod and fought him. Man at one point he just dove down underneath the boat and I thought I was gonna lose him because I had trouble loosening the drag in time. ,Fishing,ctcru8j,5,t5_2qlu4

4623888,0,t1_ctd6hjq, agreed. I cringe every time when someone suggests Ugly Stiks and Black Max combos. I see them recommended all the time and they are terrible imo. Definitely agree with the Arid and Laguna. The Daiwa Procyon rod is a good one as well and maybe pair that with a Daiwa Legalis. But either one of those is good and they wont take up your entire budget. So.. Daiwa Aird  Laguna or Daiwa Procyon  Legalis The line of your choice. Mono is recommended. Then the rest on lures good quality hooks and maybe a tacklebag if you like. This time of year I throw plastics mostly so thats what Id stock up on. High temps cause the fish not to chase as much. But please stay away from the cheap ugly stik or black max combos. Go quality that way things last a long time. Ugly Stiks last but arent the best rod to use. ,Fishing,ctdey9p,3,t5_2qlu4

4636441,0,t3_3ehcle,slip float rigs will work for almost any species. drop shoting for pan fish works as well mainly from a boat but a slip float with small hook will get them too. Carolina rig work for bass in most areas. I have had luck with mepps spinners for rainbows. Until you get better i would stay away from crank baits unless you have the cash to burn they can get snaggy. learn a few good knots as well they come in handy. Improved Clinch Knot is a easy knot and good for tieing on to your terminal tackle. Palomar knot is another little bit more hard to tie IMHO good for terminal tackle. a good site to learn said knots is Animated Knots They also have apps for smart phones for when you are in the field if you want to spend a bit of money.Some areas have clubs you can join and their members will likely help you to learn some dont so you will have to look around.  Google search for names of various rigs and click images many times there will be diagrams in the results on how to tie them. Good luck and happy fishing!

I posted the shirt designs on another account for feedback and you all gave me some great advice. This would not be possible without you and I made sure to give you all a shoutout in the campaign! Thank you again. Ok... Now time for the story.Since I got the shirts I have been fishing and trying to catch some big fish to show off with the shirts. The fishing has been absolutely BRUTAL for this past month. We had schools of bunker in but there were just no big striper on them. But FINALLY with the Kickstarter launching I was able to get this guy. I was fishing from shore and I saw a big pod of bunker getting slammed. I snagged one up and about  seconds later my drag started peeling. I was standing on a sandbar and wanted to walk the fish in to shore. However the tide was coming in quick and at one point I was up to my neck in water while fighting this fish. I landed him took some pictures and my friends family had enough striper to feed them for a week. I normally dont keep what I catch but this guy was hooked in the throat which I always feel terrible about .  I can assure you no part of this fish was wasted. We got all the meat off of the fish and put the guts skin and remaining scraps back in the ocean to feed all the beach creatures.Thank you again for all the support and making this hopeful entrepreneurs dream a reality. I will comment with the reddit link for any of you who are interested.,Fishing,cu3xznh,2,t5_2qlu4

5158351,0,t3_3lki16,For an all around trip that would take you to some amazing fishing I would spend at least ten days in Florida hands down. That is essentially our warm water Mecca of sorts. You not only have salt water at the drop of a dime but exotic fresh water species like snake head and peacock bass. They also have some of the best large mouth bass in the country.From there make a run towards Texas. You can fish for reds in the gulf as well as a variety of cool salt water fair. You also can get a guide in eastern Texas and go after alligator gar as well as giant blue and flathead catfish...Then head north west up into Colorado and get some highly desired trout species some of which people come here for the world over. Between fishing rivers and high country streams you could land green cutbow tiger cutbow and even greyling trout up north. You might even get a chance at seeing some snow by October if you dont see that where you live. I know of one fly fishing guide that is a really cool dude should you fly fish.In between all of those places as well are some amazing places to eat and see.Bad times call for amazing adventures brother!! Hell if you end up in Colorado you could crash at my pad a few days to save some bucks.Pro Tip Whatever you do get a good rod locker for the flight over I use the Plano Airliner case. When you go through security ALWAYS assist the person handling the case on how to put it back together. If you dont they will just smash the shit outta your rods I have lost a few due to this exact issue.   ,Fishing,cv7rune,2,t5_2qlu4

5213806,0,t3_3meyon,Before you go buy a rod you have to ask yourself what you want to fish with it. Are you going to use crankbaitsjerkbaitsother lures with exposed hooks? Soft plastics and jigs? Swimbaits? and so on. If youre fishing cranks for example you would want a Medium Moderate rod and use somewhere between  line. If youre fishing texas rigs jigs flukes etc a Medium Fast would be ideal. Imo a Medium Fast and a Medium Heavy Fast are the best two do it all rods. I like Medium Fast rods the most I use all Dobyns Champion s for MF  power is Dobyns medium and it has a soft enough taper that is loads up well on the cast then it release it really slings lures. So it all depends on what you want to fish. Once you know what luresstyle you want to go with your question could be answered in a more detailed manner. ,Fishing,cvegggb,1,t5_2qlu4

I have been trying to catch some channel cats at my local reservoir after work the past few weeks with limited success and have some questions Does holding the rod vs resting it on something make a difference? Wondering if vibrations from my hands might be spooking them or something Is it worth shore fishing this time of year? I have read that when the water gets cold they start going into deeper holes and become less active How long is it worth waiting for a bite before giving up and moving to a new spot?I have previously had pretty good luck at a smaller lake with a slip bobber rig and nightcrawlers but have been trying to do a slip sinker rig with punch bait at this reservoir and its just not working for me.,Fishing,cvk5oqz,2,t5_2qlu4
5265194,0,t1_cvkmpjw,Thanks for the reply Im glad Im not totally in the woods with my thinking.  One question about water clarity though.  The Chesapeake is pretty murky and low visibility a lot of the time.  The days where it is clear and not too hot I seem to do really well but there are times of low clarity and visibility that I do just as well.  If the water is murky is it a matter or using a smellier bait or do fish have eyes that can see in the murk?  Or I guess they can rely on their lateral lines and other sensory equipment.  This is a very interesting subject and I hope to get a lot of input.,Fishing,cvkoqug,1,t5_2qlu4

At the same time though I feel the real issue with overfishing of saltwater species stems from habitat loss from pollution as well as far not regulated enough commercial fishing bycatch etc. Im not saying us individuals arent supposed to be responsible but I think its normal in our society to demonize the individual for not internalizing externality but not expect the same for a fishing company or polluting business. Whos really at fault here? I wonder... All that said find a place where theres good current and structure and there will be tog.

5559843,0,t1_cwm21cn,Its incredibly versatile. You can work it really fast for pike and they will hammer it. You can slow it down and walleye and bass seem to love the motion. Ive had white bass practically inhale the thing. I even caught a crappie once when I simply set the rod down to take a fish off for my gf. Picked my rod back up and there was a crappie on it. Fish of all species fall for it. And whether it is the beads or the wide motion fish seem to be able to locate it very well in low quality water. Other lures might make a good side to side or a good vertical motion but none seem to do it all as well as this thing does. And the big thing is it caught fish whenever and wherever I threw it. I need to buy another shallow one because mine met a very toothy demise last time I threw for something other than muskies. I wish they made one in a muskie size.,Fishing,cwm8znn,1,t5_2qlu4

7430379,0,t3_4gzwe0,No matter how good you are youre gonna miss some hooksets so I wouldnt go crazy if you miss a few here and there but you definitely should be getting more than  of your strikes. People telling you to count to four and wait really long to set the hook arent giving good advice for one many bass will spit it before then and for two the ones that dont may swallow the hook so deep by then that youll kill the fish.When you feel the bite only reel if you have excessive slack in your line. If its mostly taught line bend the rod tip down a few inches towards the fish and go to the side on the hookset instead of straight up. That whole motion should happen in less than a second. Bending towards the fish first allows that hookset to really pop the hook in the fishs jaw. After setting immediately reel fast and keep lots of tension on the fish. If it starts taking out drag and feels like a big fish back off the reeling and let it run. Stouter longer rods braided line and razor sharp hooks all make for the best hook sets but obviously you may not want to use braid or heavy action rods for all applications. The one thing is make sure youre using razor sharp hooks and the right size hooks too. I typically use only  Gamakatsu splitgap hooks for all senkofluke fishing I do. I even take a chainsaw file with me in the boat and occasionally run it across the hook to touch it up. Sharp hooks make a huge huge difference. ,Fishing,d2msc9k,3,t5_2qlu4

7629220,0,t3_4j12wi,While the rule of thumb used to be no trigger spinning it is still OK to mount a baitcasting reel or even a closed face pushbutton reel on these rods.  When you hold a conventional reel you usually palm it so if your not a purist it still can be comfortable. With trigger rods the reel is mounted to be used underneath so unless you want to hold the rod so the reel is up and  turn the handle backwards with the trigger in the way it isnt a good choice. One thing you might encounter is that the butt length on spinning outfits may be longer than conventional.Check out Travel Spinng Rod for some other choices that can make a nice addition to your arsenal.,Fishing,d39egjc,1,t5_2qlu4

If this water is any where near a stream or there is any possibility for it to get to traversable water than kill it and eat it for supper. if it locked from any other water source then release it and see if it gets any bigger. as your friend has found out they are a fun fish to catch.   ,Fishing,d4dm8z3,7,t5_2qlu4

The sun is brutal on your eyes and you need good UV protection for them. I have had my Costas for almost  years and went through at least one pair of the cheap ones a year. If you look at the big picture it is worth the cost. You can get the ones with the poly lenses for around  bucks...EDIT to add this.

8261075,0,t3_4sl0h0,There is a round knob that is the spool tensioner. This applies force to the pinion and makes it more difficult for the spool to spin at all times. Too tight and you wont be able to cast very far. Too loose and you can backlash. I generally keep mine a lot looser than most fishermen recommend.Braking is often a dial or under a plate with little tabs you can push in and out. This is often magnetic and applies force only when spinning. This helps slow the spool gradually as you cast preventing backlash. With the correct braking you can have the spool tensioner very loose and throw things basically as hard as you want and still not have to thumb the spool at least until the cast lands and still not backlash. Braking tends to be much better on higher end reels. For example my Quantum Smoke is damn near impossible to backlash unless you set the braking to free essentially disabling the magnets. ,Fishing,d5a6xt5,2,t5_2qlu4

8323130,0,t3_4tihzt,Never actually hooked it but I was standing a few feet into a river fly fishing for steelhead when two big beautiful ones come out of a deep hole right in front of me. The swim near me and stop less than  feet from me right where bed of the river drops off into the hole. They sit there just below the surface just rolling around each other for a few minutes. I had enough time to float my fly past them a few times before they swam back into the hole never to be seen again. Just sitting there watching them look at my fly then ignore it was so frustrating but thats steelhead for ya. Lil bit different story about one that got away. I remember reading a few years back about someone who had hooked a huge walleye and thought it might be a state record but when they weighed it it fell WAY short. They figured they had just misjudged the size. They somehow figured out later that they had either read the scale wrong somehow or had used kg instead of lbs and it would have been a state record but by that time it was too late. I think they had already cut it up or released it or something. Im trying to find an article I remember reading a few local ones but having no luck.,Fishing,d5hy3b4,1,t5_2qlu4

Up north I catch a ton of smallmouth and a fair amount of largemouth but they usually only show themselves in the spring and fall. A largemouth in the heat of the summer on the north end is rare. In the south its a mixed bag. Perch pickerel pike smallmouth and more largemouth. I like one area called Pawn Run. I think its technically called Penn Point or cove but Ive always known it as Pawn Run. If you google it it should take you right to it. Its been great for me the last few years.

8852528,0,t1_d7bqp7q,Man  weeks? That is rough. Maybe its a technique lure thing? I know some lakes I can do a couple laps on with one lure not catch a thing then switch up and they are on fire. This weekend for example I was trying a Tiny Torpedo Spook ran around about  of the lake not even a look. Ok they arent hitting top water lets see if they are hitting just under the surfacea couple feet deep So I switched to a spinner bait. Got a couple but still nothing too impressive. Well I remember reading that You should learn something every cast...I learned they were a bit deeper than I though. The two hits I got were after I let my spinner sink for a couple seconds.Sooooo I switched to a shakey head with a biospawn plasma tail on it. Once I switched to that and was fishing deep every other cast was a nibble or a full on hit. I know this might seem like common sense and Im not trying to talk down just trying to get you on the bite because damn  weeks is rough.Im on a pretty limited budget so my tackle has to fit every role it can and do that job well. Heres my list of essentialsYum Dinger in Bumble Bee Swirl.Strike King Mini King in Chartreuse Blue Silver or Fire TigerStrike King Red Eye Shad in Sexy ShadCulprit Fire and IceNow since you appear to be creek or small pond fishing Im assuming you have a lot of weeds and vegetation to work around Id highly recommend using either of the worms above in a Weedless Texas Rig If you dont care much about size lets say youre catching to eat and only need to hit the minimum size Id suggest a  or  hook size that way the little ones can still get it. With that set up weightless weedless you can cast out on to mats and drag it across them which is why I didnt include a top water frog or you can cast in to open water and let the worm do the work for you. The Senko is a beautiful worm to use weightless because it wobbles on the way down I personally get more hits on the Senko on the drop before I even reel it the first time.The other two lures are better in semi open water especially the lipless because they are flashy and make noise.

Every two or three phone conversations with my  year old mom she would ask how come you dont fish anymore?  I eventually thought why in the hell dont I fish anymore?  Parents came to visit and my dad brought my old tacklebox and cheapy spincast rod. It was back on from there. A few grand two kayaks half dozen rods and reels and dozens of lures later I am absolutely loving it again. When I tried to explain it to my wife I just said do you remember that feeling you got on a Christmas Eve as a kid?  Imagine that feeling every time you throw your lure in he water. You may get something great you may get something okay or you may get nothing at all.  Im loving it. Nothing more relaxing than a stressful day at work speeding home and getting my gear and going to the river even if its only for an hour. Went last night and got skunked got a bite or two thats it but still just enjoyed the hell out of it. ,Fishing,d86etfp,2,t5_2qlu4

9113890,0,t3_5513y3,I live in Norway. Fishing in the sea is completely free and you can take up as much as you want but many species have minimum sizes. Fishing inland in rivers and lakes require a specific permit from whoever have fishing rights that place. It could be private or it could be state owned. Typically a  hour permit costs  and a season permit costs . These permits can be for just one lake but they are often for a group of lakes. Permits for national parks and such which can include  ish lakes or rivers will typically cost a bit more and week long permits are often available for hikers. With the abundance of fish holding waters here forced catch and release policies are very rare. Salmon fishing is another story. Much more expensive and all kinds of regulations. ,Fishing,d87cc7o,2,t5_2qlu4

9223760,0,t1_d8l5gf7,Its very hard to stop a fisherman from fishing. About  months before that in August  I was in Kona Hawaii. Off the coast there that area is known as Grander Ally due to all the  lb Marlin caught there. So the second day I was there the first full day I break the same foot in pretty much the same spot walking to the boat to go snorkeling. That boat trolls four or five rods behind them on the way there and back. They said that if a fish bites whoever gets to the rod first gets to fight the fish. So Im standing there holding on to the railing because I dont have any balance due to the freshly broken foot. Only one fish bites on the way there and back and it only stayed on for a few seconds. Next day is when we go off shore on a charter boat. We were all sitting on top where the captain sits and chatting then we see a marlin strike the lure. We pretty much all jump down and that also hurt like hell. It was worth it for the estimated  lb Blue Marlin. ,Fishing,d8l6h7b,2,t5_2qlu4

10795737,0,t1_ddthlf4,Probably helps to know that the Jackdaw event was just the thing that got an admin to look into uUnidans upvote history. Hed figured out something about both Reddit algorithms and crowd dynamics  that if a post you make whether comment or initial post gets a few upvotes before any downvotes its far more likely to accrue big karma down the line. People like to vote for whats popular you see.It turned out Unidan had a history of bumping his own posts and comments slightly with a small alt farm lt  accounts if memory serves. This was just enough to get his posts attention when he was a nobody and led to him having one of the topfive total karma scores on all of Reddit. It got to the point where people would reply to Unidan comments just to have replied to a Unidan comment. He effectively memed himself which just added to the popularity. The vote manipulation from his alts resulted in a ban. Bye bye Unidan. Bye bye karma pile. If all this seems dumb and unimportant  the faking it for internet points the resulting transient internet fame and the equally goofy way it all came to an end  thats because it is.

Now I fully admit this is one of those lax laws that I dont think there was every a charge laid for and I doubt a CO would even write up a ticket instead of just giving a warninglecture if they visually witnessed one being released but the point still stands its the proper thing to do if you value natural species.

Its hard to find specific information on where to start.I have this post I made    It has a lot of beginner information but honestly the best way to talk to people on the river.  Ive been steelheading all over North America for  years and I still have lots to learn.    All baits whether they are artificial or natural have their time and place depending on conditions.  Myself Ive converted strictly to fishing beads and other artificial baits but most people still use roe.  As for your split shot pattern that will also depend on the type of water youre fishing deep shallow slow fast.    Fishing for steelhead can sometimes be frustrating especially since our numbers here in Southern Ontario have been on a steady decline  making timing one of the most important factors for catching steelhead.  When I first started steelheading as a teenager I didnt hook my first steelhead for at least  months it was extremely frustrating but I kept at it.  Once you get it though everything starts coming that much easier.  My past couple outings havent been to great went  today.  Heres the only fish I was able to land today  ,Fishing,dffzjlo,1,t5_2qlu4

Because theyre really only interested in guarding the bed you want a bait that you can keep on the bed as long as possible. Things like a drop shot football head jig or a Texas rigged craw with a  weight will let you keep your bait on the bed longer this is why a weightless wacky rig isnt great because after a few twitches its going have passed over the bed already.
