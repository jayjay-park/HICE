3920845,0,t3_35bh6w,Sorry if this isnt the answer you are looking forTry and focus more on what you need to do to stop rather than how to make the cuts worse.  Planning on how to make things worse for ourselves is a reality that most of us face but we should not ask each other for tips and tricks in how to do it more effectively.  It would be akin to asking people in AA for advice on how to hide liquor easier some of the other people there might know how but it would be morally wrong for them to negatively influence your actions because of their knowledge.  It would be wrong because theyve been there theyve struggled and they want to stop.  They want to help others stop.  Encouraging them to get worse is absolutely the opposite of those goals.For some self harming can be an obsession making it extremely hard not to think about cutting constantly but if you can start to rephrase it from How can I hurt myself worse today? into thinking about things like Why do I need to do this? What the feeling gives me in doing this?  What would need to change for me to stop? etc. hopefully that will give you will have a chance at recovery.  I still have plenty of days where I think about what I need to do next to make myself feel even more pain absolutely.  Honestly Im a long ways off from stopping myself so I dont want to make it seem like this is a magic fix of some kind but trying to fight the urge trying to stop is good.Maybe you dont want recovery.

Our lives are really long amp people come amp go. I thought I was going to marry my st bf amp that was wrong thank god. Everyone changes amp so does the world.. We have to survive those changes to make us better people. My favorite thing to remember when Im depressed is that we cant be happy all the time. There have to be times of sadness to make the good so sweet. Please know that it will get better. I dont know your age but the teen years were the WORST for me. Your emotions are all over the place. I am now on Zoloft due to depression. If you need help reach out to someone who can help you with that. Its easy all you do is go to a primary care doctor amp tell them how you feel. I didnt even need to see a psychologist which is what I was scared of.  Please message me if you want to talk bc I have been through it all. Abuse from bfs cheating family not letting me come home abuse at home etc. I really do care. I would love to be able to help someone since no one helped me when I needed it.

5684561,0,t3_3symx8,Im sorry that youre hurting right now but you dont have to give up.Ive been where you are Ive celebrated birthdays thinking how I couldnt possibly endure another at the mercy of my own destructive mind. While my pain and despair are not identical to yours as we each carry unique reasons I can empathize with the hopelessness I sense. Im still here and alive. Somewhat reluctantly I suppose my body has been pretty determined to stay alive. But you know what I found that sometimes life doesnt suck as bad and these are the times when Im content with being alive. During the bad times I thought that it would always be bad. I thought I would never see a glimmer of hope. My mind was lying to me but the only way I found out that the darkness doesnt last forever was sticking around long enough for it to happen.I also have to come to accept my self harm and the many scars I have. I am working on processing the reasons behind my self harm and why it has worked for me and to effect still does. I also have the accept that my self harm serves a purpose. Accepting self harm doesnt mean I think its a healthy way to deal with life it means I accept my mind simply didnt know any other way. My scars will be around forever and thats something very difficult to come to terms with. My scars will heal with time and my mind will as well. I recently realized that the only way my body and mind will ever heal is if I stop tearing it apart. Both physically and emotionally. So thats what Im doing right now...and I could have never imagined I would come to this point.I dont know if this helps or even makes any sense as its getting late but I want you to know that youre not alone. I want you to know that at least one person in the world cares about you and if you want I will support you as best I can.Death may seem like the ideal way out for you but it doesnt have to be. I wont try to talk you out of making a decision. I can only offer a helping hand if you want to try living for a bit longer. Im not sure how close to the edge you are tonight so I want to add if you think you might want to stick around on this planet for a little more but cant keep yourself safe it would be worth considering heading to Emergency. Even if you arent admitted inpatient youll at least be somewhere safe for a few hours to get to talk about everything swirling around your head.Take care. x,selfharmpics,cx1q3uo,3,t5_2wvin

6322575,0,t1_cz7z244,I cant change your mind nor do I have that right. But as someone whos had multiple attempts years of self harm and self hate and a chronic desire to die I encourage you to reconsider. Why? Because life can turn around even when you dont think it can. Maybe sharing my recent discovery may provide some hope or maybe not but Ill give it a shot. Only recently did I find something  healthy  that relieved some of my chronic suicidality and made my self harm manageable. I had given up hope actually a long time ago and the only reason Im not dead was my inability to gain the appropriate means to end my life. And Im thankful now. I met with a psychiatrist by chance and she took the time to listen to my story. Turns out my self harm and chronic suicidality is assumed to be caused by OCD Not BPD as is the typical assumption so I was placed on a new med and its fucking phenomenal. And suddenly everything changed  where I believed I would always suffer with my unbearable pain Im no longer in constant suffering. Life isnt perfect and it has its shitty moments but at least I dont want to die  and for me thats a huge difference. I really hope that youll reconsider but in the end you have every right to choose to end your life. You also have every right to choose to live. Maybe stick around for a bit longer and give life a chance to get better? I mean how I see it youve got what you need to kill yourself. You have a solid back up plan if things dont work. You can always choose to die whenever you want but once youre dead you obviously cant choose to come back. So why not make a sort of bucket list. Do everything you wanted to do but havent done. Literally live knowing you can choose how and when to die. Hell that seems like an advantage compared to the majority of people. I dont know if this helped and Ill end the comment here to avoid it going on too long. Just know there are a lot of people that care about you even if its just on here were people behind our usernames and we do care about you. ,selfharmpics,cz8b2va,6,t5_2wvin

6957021,0,t1_d14izs8,From my personal nonmedical experience  I think you could have used at least  stitches with these cuts. Probably more actually considering some of the cuts that could have used stitches didnt get them. While its difficult to stitch them theres only a small bit of skin between a couple of the cuts if the doctor cant do it herself thats when she should have called in a plastic surgeon. Its not as extreme as it sounds Ive had a plastic surgeon called in to stitch close a head wound. He did a wonderful job too. Try not to be afraid of asking for more stitches. Ive had to in the past. Ive asked for a few more stitches on some cuts and Ive even asked for some cuts to be stitched when the doctor was on the fence could have gone without but the stitches minimized the scarring. I know how difficult it can be but remember youre the one who is going to have to deal with the healing process and scars. ,selfharmpics,d14wun8,2,t5_2wvin

10758376,0,t3_5tw8r0,Redness swelling and pain are signs of infection. Though there are other things this could be I would tend to think infection because of the cuts. Even the best cleaning habits can lead to infection. Personally I wouldnt drain it on my own because you could make things worse. But you could do other things like warm compresses to draw the infection out. My personal suggestion would be to visit a doctor doesnt have to be the ER if youre more comfortable with a specific doctors practice or something though hospital policies are probably different and every doctor varies on their practices Ive never been held by a doctor for my cutsscars. You could need it drained and if its an infection antibiotics. I hope it gets better! Stay safe. ,selfharmpics,ddpnalx,1,t5_2wvin

11108198,0,t1_dequjb7,Its a bit infected so itll need to be cleaned as infection leads to greater scarring. Make a  solution of hydrogen peroxide and water. Take either a sterile dressing if you have it or some paper towels if you dont soak it and very gently scrub the surface to get that gunk off. Bacteria likes to live under exudate. Once the gunk is off take the rest of the solution and run it over the wound. Pat dry or air dry. Cover it with a decent amount of bacitracin or Neosporin. Try to bring the edges of the skin together as best as possible and then tape it in that position with one or two steri strips. Smaller wounds scar less. If you dont have that use a butterfly or regular bandaid. Change the dressing daily. As long as it still looks red during the dressing change reapply bacitracin.,selfharmpics,der3rum,3,t5_2wvin

11319580,0,t3_61ju54,I mean how in the fuck are you supposed to even make yourself stop? Its crazy. Cutting over fresh skin is damn near painless. Feels like nothing but perfection.  Edit Oh yeah those white scars you see in one of the pics are sixteen freaking years old! They were once cuts that looked very much like the new ones in both width and depth and were left open to heal on their own. It was before I got ballsy enough to start stitching myself up at home and the stitched scars are a little smaller. I closed these new cuts with butterfly bandages and superglue. Im very curious about how the scars will age compared to the others. Ive done it this way about a dozen or so times since I relapsed and the scars look like theyll be a little smaller than the ones I stitched but theyre still too new to be sure. Ive noticed that a lot of people around here seem to love their scars and intentionally screw with their wounds to make them bigger so maybe Im in the minority on this but as much gratification as I get from making the cuts Im not thrilled about people seeing my scars because their cause is pretty obvious and I very much dislike the idea of random people being able to know so much about me with just a glance.  ,selfharmpics,dff2094,5,t5_2wvin

11581546,0,t3_65ajdd,If you have steri strips you could tape it up if you want. It isnt to fat so you could hypothetically just leave it although it could leave a decent scar. You can make your own butterfly bandages using any medical tape. Cut them into thin strips and use them to tape the wound shut. Just wash the wound with water and soap then cover it with a band aid. Keep it clean and covered until it closes up.,selfharmpics,dg8rwtn,5,t5_2wvin
