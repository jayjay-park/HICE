Chances are hes just scared of change and new things and extremely emotionally insecure. ,JustNoSO,d8d7ddi,7,t5_3982d

9349343,0,t3_58jo57,When I was younger my dad had a project vehicle he was working on and bought a donor truck for it a rusted out piece of garbage but the parts were still great. The donor was kept outside tucked away by the garage but visible if you drove by.One afternoon the police stopped by and told dad that theyd gotten a complaint about the run down donor truck being an eyesore and asked him to remove it or face finestickets.Guess one of the neighbors felt like being a jerk that day. shrug But dad took off what he thought hed need and sent the donor to the junkyard.Perhaps something similar might light that fire you need? Good luck! ,JustNoSO,d913i5j,3,t5_3982d

10475840,0,t3_5pzzc4,Omg shes more than horrid. Im so sorry. I had an abusive boyfriend who actually did end up committing suicide back in  and here I am...Happy. Let her if shes going to do it. Not your fault. Not up to you. Id be more than angry at her for missing someone else who she thought I was even if you were faking. She raped that guy. She abused that guy she just abused you more. Not that you were anyone else but you know what I mean? Youre not good enough for her because she cant control you. You can leave and rent a room with the worst roommate available and it will still be better than where you are. Its so fucking hard to get out after so much time but I hope you do. And I hope she rots. There are some things not of this world and maybe some of that was real I just think you have to process it for a while without her to see whats what. ,JustNoSO,dcvjmsx,10,t5_3982d

10757837,0,t3_5ttggh,My husband has ADHD which is being treated and weve talked....and he still does this.Weve even admitted that its a war of attrition.  We both hate cleaning and because we have no kids I dont have to do it.The problem is that he learned from his Mom that if he just doesnt do it for long enough shell do it.  So he just gets surprised when it doesnt get done. Today he actually cleaned up his den  mancave.  Now he did it not completely but the worst of it because he was moving gear around and basically couldnt avoid touching the gear that had turned light grey from black with dust.  I can outwait him.  I really can.  But I avoid his bathroom like the plague room it is.  ,JustNoSO,ddpl9wj,2,t5_3982d

10952198,0,t3_5wbvmp,No. No one deserves this. Its why we have a justice system so that people not emotionally connected with events can judge on whether what was done was bad or not since people involved can overreact to wrongdoings metering an unfair punishment like your SS. With all that shes done to you she has so much responsibility for whats happened. You tried your damned hardest to be what she wanted you to be.This honestly sounds like it could possibly head to court. Im the event that it does you need to start speaking to a psychologist and a lawyer. If these arent financially a choice then get to a place where you will be protected.Keeping you in my thoughts. Stay strong you will be free eventually.,JustNoSO,de9n3o6,2,t5_3982d

10968757,0,t3_5wkx5y,Something I learned about deleting posts but Im not sure how  true it is yet better safe than sorryEdit it first or instead before deleting. Apparently there are some sites that will findrecreatesomething like that the last content of a post before it was deleted. I dont remember exactly and im only on for a middle of the night bathroom break so my brain isnt all the way on but I remember reading that on a different support sub cant remember which either sorry so I had to mention it here.

10999839,0,t1_deeiyut,Hes probably white knuckling it just trying to maintain right now. Its not okay to be rude to you. All Im saying is he doesnt have the emotional bandwidth to manage an overly emotional wife right now. Dads probably easier to talk to as hes not likely to cry at the drop of a hat making him feel even worse you know?Having had a few depressed people close to me... and they dont like to hear this but... When it gets bad they get extremely selfabsorbed. Its not always an intentional thing meant against you some people are manipulative assholes. Its just they are overwhelmed by their own negative feelings. Your feelings are seen through the prism of how it it affects them. An emotionally stable person sees their spouses concern and takes measures to alleviate or at least validate it. A depressed person will either throw up their hands I cant deal with this or take it as an attack you are making this all about you. The irony of course is that you are bending over backwards to help them and make them feel better. But even if you  traveled a thousand miles for them they cant make it a few steps to the door to let you in.,JustNoSO,deesrre,3,t5_3982d

11026452,0,t1_dehhlmu,Thank you you for replying. I really do take strength from everyones words of encouragement to others and use them to get through my own issues.The being able to leave so quick for me was a big red flag as I have been in a mentally and abusive relationship and as you said a mere look can force submission. I know this to be a fact and could not quite wrap my head around the strength he seem to come up with in such a short time span.Again thank you for taking the time to reply and to say that my comment gives you courage it is nice to know that somewhere someone hears my words and takes time out of their own life to respond.,JustNoSO,dehtnmm,3,t5_3982d

11133596,0,t1_detz6oo,I agree with you completely. In the case I know cops lied. It took two years to prove so. Judges arent squeaky clean either. HOWEVER its good that you dont have to worry about those things. My comment was mostly to show the worry people have. People can be cutthroat and fake evidence or buy people off. When going thru heartbreak its good you wont have to worry about psycho inlaws causing issues. I hope you figure out the money issues soon. ,JustNoSO,detzdxu,7,t5_3982d

11345200,0,t3_61vx66,As per the SubaruDrove one in Montana on our honeymoon. Absolutely loved it and Im seriously thinking about getting one in a couple of years. Are they really as safe as theyre made out to be? The city I live in is like number one in our state for fatal car accidents. Seriously I think everyone who moves here immediately decides that drunk driving is the height of cool. Its either that or the heroin epidemic. Our local news crew did an expose on heroin and caught someone shooting up in a parking lot during rush hour and then immediately pulling in to traffic. Ugh. So safety is probably the most important thing to me when looking for a car. I love all the bells and whistles the new ones have the blind spot detection especially since Im blind in my right eye.
