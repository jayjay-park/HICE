2266249,0,t3_2l34tt,It was suggested to me to post this here. The old version. that some people seem to likeThe newer denoised and slightly raised in volume version.I mostly put up the new version because the download limit was reached on the old one. and denoised it because its old and why not.Only had the headphones to check it so im not entirely sure which one is better maybe the slight hiss makes it better dunno. I can never tell what people like or dont like about my music i kinda like this song though. though its my stuff as soon as im finished making it i have allready listened to it to shit. ,TechnoProduction,clrttqr,2,t5_2v4k9

3888143,0,t3_34w476,You could try a tehnique that is common in schranz. Basically get a hard kick and an open hatride. Group them distort the living shit out of it and eq the low end. Got this tip from Balkansky its awesome for really heavy stuff.,TechnoProduction,cqzhd1n,5,t5_2v4k9
4179024,0,t1_crwlln2,All good man. The more the better.  Like I have said. Its not done yet. This is just the product of me playing with my drum machines for a few hours last Saturday. I do agree a pad and some other elements need to be added to help the first brake. The intro is made to be a minimal house grove something that kind of keeps you bobbing for a bit. I could make the filter seep a bit longer maybe. The first big could use something to make it more warm I think but its done the way it is to give it that raw under engineered kind of feel. Like old school Detroit style.  The subbass could be brought up a bit in loudness I think but it doesnt have much harmonics to start with. Its just there really to fill the gap between the kick and lead stab. Thanks for the feed back though. ,TechnoProduction,crwm3m0,1,t5_2v4k9
4743243,0,t3_3fbg3p,hello techno heads im back on the monthly feedback thread to get some on this one    sounds a bit like keith carnal if you know ,TechnoProduction,ctsfi9f,1,t5_2v4k9
4880929,0,t3_3hpfwy,Mr. Bill did a video on how to create interesting evolving background noises and soundscapes. Its really helpful. But if you just want to fill space. Use percussion hits with a lot of reverb and lots compression after the reverb. ,TechnoProduction,cu9s1o7,1,t5_2v4k9
5613860,0,t3_3rddxh,this file on my desktop has been staring at me the last couple of days. i have a little buzz going now so i dont care and decided to share it haha! hope someone can chime in and tell me whats wrong with it. dont feel right...personally i think it starts kinda promising that intro sells it imo but is a let down after all. dunno too poppy sounding. not deep and grimey like i want to. maybe i should disregard the bass melody for starters and keep it simpler... anyway im close to hating it. almost feeling ashamed. want to be cool guys! hahabtw moving to berlin this year! tracks should come out murder if not ill hang myself lol jk.,TechnoProduction,cwsyc8q,4,t5_2v4k9

6222613,0,t1_cywrc0k,Well basically its what i thought. You have not found the finesse to make each sound good you are still learning how to do it. Its basically colors. You cant put too many together without it becoming mud. it comes with practice.,TechnoProduction,cywxzfj,2,t5_2v4k9
6425636,0,t1_czjxog2,Thanks the arp was made on my modular and Ive since totally repatched it so no rerecording it unfortunately. I might play around with filters in my DAW and see how that sounds to add some movement. I did try dropping it out but when I did I felt the track just lost all momentum in hindsight I might of been able to keep it going with some new percussion or something different coming in for a bit. ,TechnoProduction,czjy4wc,1,t5_2v4k9

7852359,0,t3_4lydup,Some new stuff that I would really appreciate some feedback on. Posted this late last month and never got any feedback on it. Concerned with the mix down but I mostly like everything else about it. Would really like to hear some input on where the mix could improve. Not exactly techno but not exactly house or techhouse either. Im actually pretty proud of the sound design on this and how the whole thing came out but Id love some notes on what could make it better. Also Im sort of nervous about shopping these around to labels because Im always concerned if my particular aesthetic matches the sound of the label. If anyone could point me toward some labels that these might fit that would be greatly appreciated. ,TechnoProduction,d3yobjm,5,t5_2v4k9

8931044,0,t1_d74lbat,Or maybe try having a quiet sub playing constantly throughout the song with like one bar long notes playing one after another. It will fill out the gaps in the bass notes not in an obvious way but it fills out the low end. Also can add a bit of groove if done right.,TechnoProduction,d7ldoij,1,t5_2v4k9

10709559,0,t1_ddklndm,Oh sure I wasnt suggesting you sampled them. I arrived at more or less the same chords a while back but my track was not as good as yours. I think its a D minor triad stab or something? Cant remember off hand.,TechnoProduction,ddklztc,1,t5_2v4k9

10900860,0,t1_ddpcgai,It happens in music genres that are underground. People tend to think they know more than you do. Thats ok dude!I suggest you listen some of these guys theyre dark but they really will be worth a listen once you get into the techno genre more Jon Hopkins Attlas more similar to what you like Hot Since  Matt Lange Ephemera is a masterpiece,TechnoProduction,de4ch5k,1,t5_2v4k9
10900898,0,t1_de4btnu,For your first question depends on what I feel like doing that particular day. But the most important to learn the differences tiny additions or removals can have on a groove. For your second question sometimes i use my drum brute other times I chop a loop and take parts i like. Sometimes i program with midi but there isnt really something that I always go to it depends on what I feel like doing. The way to make premade loops fit is to listen carefully how they impact the other groove elements you have in your song. Just tune your ear to seeing if the groove is off or on. ,TechnoProduction,de4cm97,1,t5_2v4k9
