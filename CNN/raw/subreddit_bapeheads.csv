6627138,0,t1_d04lh0t,Correct. There are numerous issues with the neck tag  ape face isnt the correct shape size tag is much too short ape head on bottom tag is horribly misshaped font on care tags is wrong stitching of care tags is wrong gold ape tag goes under the care tags and not on top. Furthermore this jacket was never made. This is an extremely bad fake.,bapeheads,d04sxcv,5,t5_2y6cx
