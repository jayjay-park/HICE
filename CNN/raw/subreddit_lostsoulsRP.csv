5040015,0,t1_cuti4ds,My body stiffens at the sound of more squeaks and the thought of a family of these filthy rodents but Im careful not to jerk around and make a sudden movement. The sickening sucking makes me wince and shift back by a few inches. I lift my hand out of the slime a point my improvised weapon at the rat ahead. Trying my best to keep my hand steady I glance over my shoulder to check on the sounds from behind.,lostsoulsRP,cutih3j,1,t5_39lb8
5104945,0,t1_cv17s1v,I briefly eye the tunnel before quickly concluding that it will be a last resort. The damage done to the flooring here would seem to indicate a strong possibility of something dangerous lurking in that direction so I turn instead to the clearest sign yet of human habitation. Pausing only for a moment to consider whether knocking would be worthwhile I reach in for the handle of the door and test it to see if I can get through.,lostsoulsRP,cv1c47q,1,t5_39lb8
5110327,0,t1_cv1mg6h,Several seconds pass with none of the airborne rats coming any closer.  Then she sees two of them slowly break formation circling in a wide arc.  They slowly swoop down and come at her from both sides approaching rapidly with claws outstretched.,lostsoulsRP,cv1zifs,1,t5_39lb8
5254381,0,t1_cvj6lgt,When Eveanore picks up the flask she dusts it off and takes a good look at it. She becomes fond of its design but notes its uselessness. She tries to shove her hand inside it to see if anything is hidden inside it but of course they are too big for it. She stores it away. Maybe someone is looking for this thing? It seems to her that these crates were from a shipment and this is a prized artifact in her perspective.The souls though.... she salivates over the sight of it. She caresses the white mass smelling its sweet scent. She consumes the soul of an aimless wanderer immediately out of pure lust once she is done playing with her food.,lostsoulsRP,cvjcafy,1,t5_39lb8
5322413,0,t1_cvrl97r,Calvin bites his lip. This is going to be hairy. He carefully lowers his upper body until he is squatting on the shaky chain. He extends reaching his hands out to grab the chain in front of him. In this position he carefully creeps along moving only one limb at a time. The way calvin sees it having  anchor points is more beneficial than having two and his hands provide more grip than his feet ever could. Unfortunately this movement is very taxing on Calvins core muscles and he feels his stomach tensing. He is a mercenary physical exercise is part of his everyday routine but if this takes too long he will lose his strength and fall. Who knows how deep the chasm below is? He shudders and picks up his pace. He stays low to the chain so as too avoid the full force of the tempestuous breeze.,lostsoulsRP,cvs00qt,1,t5_39lb8
