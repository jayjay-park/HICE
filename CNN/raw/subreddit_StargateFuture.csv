9720824,0,t1_dab8zni,Id be happy to be part of this part of the time line yes as long as we all knock out some major plot points such as whether or not to reveal the program the major characters and timinglocation of major events eg. where Atlantis ends up who any new allies would be any new bad guys whether any wraith will survive the battle when to reinitiate contact with Pegasus and the overall goalsmoods of Ronon and Tayla.Edit is anyone here good with computer graphics? Could someone draw up a graphic timeline once the major points are settled? The reference would be invaluable as people try to fit their story ideas in here or there.,StargateFuture,dabaxdj,1,t5_3hnmz
