Hes previously been determined to be in public school through high school. The shooting in June made a large impact in his decision to  move back home with me which is in a much smaller community and  decide to complete his high school credits with a publicschoolathome program. Given his recent experience  he was friends with the shooter considered him a good kid and his girlfriend was a friend of the victim  its made this kind of thing feel much more real and relevant to my other children.,homeschool,clphu9e,1,t5_2qhfo
2295195,0,t3_2lhu37,I was in the exact same position and pulled my son with ADHD out of public school in the middle of nd grade. It is not easy but ultimately I know it was the right move for him. I disagree with the advice to avoid computerbased curriculum. Anything that holds your sons attention is worth trying. What works for typical kids may not work for your son. We transitioned into homeschooling with a computerbased program called TimeLearning. I mostly liked it for its language arts program and my son loved it so much hed log on himself and start that days lesson! It is around month and is honestly the reason my son is able to read with any kind of fluency  years later. As far as curriculum beware of spending a ton of money on curriculum that may or may not engage the ADHD mind. We took the plunge this year and got RightStart math because Id heard a lot of ADHD homeschoolers had luck with it. So far I pretty much love it and it was worth the . What I like about it for my son is that its very hands on lots of manipulatives NO worksheets he hates those and they really are pointless for homeschoolers and lots of games. For reading we use All About Reading and I love that too. There are a lot of handson activities. For science we use an eclectic approach  lots of experiments and I try to follow what he is into at the moment. I also love unit studies for science and social studies. You can find some great resources online.One important thing to consider is give him a few weeks to a month to deschool. Dont push anything on him schoolwise. Take field trips to the childrens museum take some nature walks just let him decompress. Also dont try to replicate school at home. Ive learned the hard way that its just going to cause pushback. Play games. Read together. Give him lots of love. It may not show but I know the constant negative feedback at school made my son feel like a total failure. It took a while for his selfesteem to build back up. Another piece of advice I dont know if this is even an issue for you but it was for me is to stop comparing him academically to other kids his age. Kids with ADHD are often on their own timeline and when hes older it really wont matter if he learned to read fluently at  or . If you have any other questions feel free to send me a private message. Im not an expert by any means but I definitely understand where youre coming from!!!,homeschool,clvehn4,1,t5_2qhfo

2756771,0,t3_2rk5tm,I agree with the other comments. I was home schooled all the way up until high school and I also skipped grade . I grew up in a house full of siblings and honestly its made our bond so much better not only do I think it will be fine for you to home school and take care of the baby I actually think it might be even easier and overall more beneficial especially since its what your son really wants!!. As they get older they can help each other out if you decide to home school the second child as well and youll all end up much much closer as a family since you spend all of your time together. Im not sure exactly what the dynamic is of other home schoolers but for us my mom basically ran it like this Heres the work try to figure it out on your own. If you cant get it ask your brothers. If theyre not around cant help you come ask me. Might be weird compared to other peoples way of doing it but my mom was a busy lady so this gave her time to still work on stuff while my brothers and I learned to be independent and figure things out for our own. I learned much more being home schooled than I did after in real school. And as for the grade jump I dont consider myself to even be that overly smart and I didnt even notice it all it did was give me a head start. So youve totally set your son up to be successful and early to the race. Best of luck with everything Im sure if you decide to you will make a fantastic teacher!,homeschool,cnhfm95,1,t5_2qhfo

As we read a text we are making inferences making connections to prior knowledge using context clues such as pronouns to determine characters analyzing character motivation and more.

3018801,0,t3_2tyyed,My kids are too young for school yet but Im leaning toward homeschooling when the time comes mostly for now because I want them to have a strong fun and engaging science and literature based curriculum more learning by doingexperiencing and the freedom from the tight school year schedule. I grew up in an average school system and didnt feel like I ever got the depth of material that I wanted or the time I needed for areas I struggled with. I also feel that there is a strong lack of science in most school curricula and a low bar across subjects. I want more for my kids. I was also a teachers kid and we lived far away from our extended family. We could only travel during school breaks to see family and we almost never went on a typical vacation because we could only go at peak times for travel and it was too expensive. Now my husband and I live a distance from my parents and still live far away from extended family and I want to visit them but not force the kids to have every single holiday or break involve an intense travel schedule and no down time. This is definitely a personal issue on my end but homeschooling offers a great ability to fix it.,homeschool,coaw9y5,1,t5_2qhfo

The minimum age is young enough in most cases that you could easily graduate with a year degree at ... same age as most people get a HS diploma but youre already ahead.Most colleges will let you test out of many of the really lowlevel classes CLEPDSST as you mentioned but I took a different route.  I took harder more interesting and more educational classes in order to fulfill those basic requirements.  For example instead of English  I took a level class in rhetorical writing.  Guidance counsellors are ecstatic to see students taking harder classes than they require and will tend to bend rules right and left in order to help you adjust the standard curriculum to match your goals.,homeschool,cp7m879,1,t5_2qhfo

3903439,0,t1_cr15vml,I signed up for calculus classes at the Community College of Rhode Island when I was  ... but I could have done it when I got my drivers license at  and graduated at  with a year degree.  High school is pretty much a waste of time IMO unless you are pushing into higher learning.  In public school it is a time of social molding and in home school it is a time of rehashing the same subjects over again albeit in greater detail.  Skip that skip the HS diplomaGED drama go straight to college.Note CCRI has an official requirement that students must have a high school diploma or GED before attending.  This is displayed publicly on the website and the admissions personnel are quick to turn you away.  However there are a lot of people in the world who dont have either and it turns out that if you enroll in the bottomofthebarrel remedial educational program they called it General Studies then you do not actually need a high school diploma.  Once you are enrolled you can switch to any degree track you want.  This is for CCRI but I suspect that most colleges will have similar rules ... and ways around those rules.Another avenue is to enroll as a nonmatriculated student.  Youll bypass mostall of the admissions requirements and can later switch to fully matriculated without going through the admissions process.,homeschool,cr185fx,2,t5_2qhfo

4141855,0,t3_35zvyq,Id recommend checking if there are local community colleges near you.  Never mind the HS diploma or GED get yourself a real college degree by age  and be way way ahead of the game.Thats what I wish I had done.  From about thgrade on I was largely selftaught.  It would have been a vastly better experience to jump straight to college as soon as I could drive.College is way different.  You have teachers who actually teach some of them do not teach well but they do teach! you have material that is both interesting and challenging and having actual peers in the classroom makes things much easier.Most colleges have onpaper requirements that you must present a high school diploma.  However most of these can be worked around.  For example you can enroll as a nonmatriculating student then switch to regular enrollment once youve built a transcript with good grades.  Or you can do what I did and enroll in their bottomrun General Studies program to skip the diploma requirement its for people who screwed up so badly they were ejected from HS and cant get a GED but then switched to my program of choice once in the system.  Theres almost always a way around the requirement.  Dont lie and if you cant find a way then dont be afraid to talk to a dean probably not admissions they often dont know anything and they certainly dont have the power to help you to get special acceptance.Colleges really love to have motivated students on board and many colleges are particularly interested in homeschoolers because they work hard dont cause trouble and tend to get very good grades.,homeschool,crse0h0,1,t5_2qhfo
4539653,0,t3_3cg1da,My kids are younger  amp  but I have had about  years of experience with a very wide range of homeschooling families. I have seen kids who could barely read at  go on to advanced degrees and kids who completed careful curriculum drop out of community college and wander aimlessly. The difference seems to come down to attitude not curriculum. Kids with the right attitude catch up and do fine. I sort of unschool but I dont think of it in that terminology. For me it is Life Learning. I want kids who have the capacity to get what they need from life in a wide variety of environments. Dont be afraid to try new things. Try radically new things and abandon them without regret if they fail. And please dont compare yourself  to the super homeschooling moms. They are sharing the highlights not the struggles we ALL have.AND last thing invest in yourself! You are the  role model for your kids. You want them to be successful? Be successful yourself. Whatever that means for you...getting out and exercising taking a class living your own life to its fullest. It feels selfish because as moms we are wired to sacrifice but they need to see you as a real person living your own life. It is healthy.

I know that where I am there are always younger siblings around so plenty of kids that arent of school age yet. The benefit is that your childs preschool friends will be fellow homeschoolers.

5007778,0,t3_3jiwye,You ask a great question. Im in similar shoes  Christian homeschooled and now a homeschooler myself. The curriculum we are using is kind of similar. Now Im only up to nd grade so Im not in the trenches so to speak yet but my approach now and will continue to be that my God isnt limited by mans interpretation of information. If He created the earth in   hour periods and then made it look like he didnt fine. If He took billions of years to form creation through evolution and a Big Bang so be it. What we DO know is that the point of science is to create solid facts upon which we can build our world and our understanding of it. And if we want to continue to enjoy the benefits of science our modern world and its safety security comfort and health we have to accept and build on the currently known facts. Not one of those parents or students is in a position to deny any form of science  if you dont want to teach evolution than you must also omit all the other scientific theories that we rely on. My personal take is that I will teach ALL of it. Yes. I will teach about the young earth idea. Why we have it why people think its important and why there are problems with it. I will teach the presently accepted scientific answers to cosmic creation and evolution why we have it why people think its important and why there are problems with it. Thats the beauty of science  we have so much more to learn and every day we get new answers to questions. If I believe in a Deity than the overarching theme to that belief is that it has entire omnipotence omnipresence and omniscience. Without those elements then it is not a God. If my God is in fact God he can do and say anything at all and he doesnt owe me an explanation. My God has a record though so Im inclined to trust him that these answers will work out in the end and it will all make sense. We know people with mental disorders arent witches and we dont burn anyone at the stake. Thats something we used to do. Now we dont because we know better and even though it seemed right to people at the time based on what they thought they knew about God and the earth but seriously. We will again some day look back at this time with the same hindsight based on the new knowledge we will have. I dont know how you can tackle your particular predicament but I think you need to approach the parents and let them know that you want to adjust the curriculum. Maybe give them the option to supplement the lessons with the biblical emphasis at home but while in class you would like to focus purely on the science and the facts at hand? I dont know if this is helpful at all but like I said  Im in your shoes and Ive been giving this a lot of thought lately especially since we started school last week and our curriculum is the same way. ,homeschool,cupmjyu,2,t5_2qhfo

I live in Arizona which requires no records for homeschoolers. I dont have any sort of tracking system and I imagine it would be pretty hard to keep an accurate running log for reporting.I think education comes from discovery so I dont have much scheduled education time.

I receive email notifications from nearby cities for lectures library events festivals classes and any other community event that looks interesting.
