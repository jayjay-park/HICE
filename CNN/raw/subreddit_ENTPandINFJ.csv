Usually Ill buy something from the store and eat it until it is gone then Ill buy something else. So I dont mind eating the same thing a few days in a row I just couldnt do it every day for more than a couple weeks. Id need to have a little variation even if it was  the same.,ENTPandINFJ,coxxzwc,1,t5_375yi

5064907,0,t1_cuw6ldk,No i am absolutely not a dog person. But call of the wild was really well written and the dog is the main character i strongly sympathize with. He went through a lot of shit and yet managed to push theough.Ian is supposedly ISFP though.I think the most consequent trend in my list is the typical I dont really fit the rest of my world characteristic.,ENTPandINFJ,cuwihiv,1,t5_375yi
