130571,0,t1_cet9x39,Its more like switch to backskate. In older versions of the series it used to be a button to make your guy face the puck no matter what and the skating adjusted to accommodate that.The current system is something like this If youre standing totally idle holding L your guys will face the puck. If youre skating towards the puck you can tap L and turn  on your left stick you guys will transition from forward skating to backskating. If youre a D and want to make a onetimer you need to be holding L as youre holding up on the R stick in anticipation of the pass. If youre in the offensive zone skating with the puck and you hold L youll face the opposite direction youre skating and try to attack by backskating.To get the full effect you need to turn off Auto Backskate in your controller settings. The nd bullet is the most important aspect of vision control. Its a quick way to switch the orientation of your skates in relation to the direction youre skating. If youre locked in as a forward when you anticipate your D getting the puck if youre backchecking tap L the same moment you swing your L stick from backskating  oclock to forward skating  oclock. This is the best way to keep your momentum in transition plays.,EA_NHL,cetau84,3,t5_2ry2z

135323,0,t3_1vmkru,The higher level you get the worse this problem gets.  People can say that youre the one allowing the shots all the time but in my opinion...its pathetic how some higher rank people can only score goals that way.  Its extremely frustrating you can defend it perfectly all game but that one time you let the shot through it goes in..because its just the sweet spot thats in the game.  Maybe Im just oldschool or too realistic about the game.  But I love playing and setting up real plays and scoring different ways.  I really dont understand how people dont get bored of only doing one play every single time they enter the zone.  It really shows how little skill you actually need to get high rank in these games though unfortunately.P.S  I guarantee the people saying that its your fault you allow those shots are the ones who score  of their goals by abusing that spot.  ,EA_NHL,cetud3n,22,t5_2ry2z

The most annoying thing is when you play a guy who CONSTANTLY tries the same exploit shot every time he gets in the zone.This week I played a dude who would if given any sort of space either try to walk into the slot and wrist it short side Id block his shots and pokecheck him EVERY TIME or just shoot a weak backhand from the boards. The game was boring as hell and it wasnt play defense it was stop the cheap exploits. The worst thing is he actually scored on  glitch shots that came from outside the slot. I shit you not he had  shots at the end of the game and only  scoring chances. The dude just keep shooting floaters at my Halak until he had a brain fart. It was tied at  at the end of OT with me dominating the flow of play and having like triple his TOI. He accidentally quit and sent me a message saying that he shouldve won and that I sucked because he had more shots. I just wanted to punch him in the face.

Its too easy to just turn around pretty much in a new direction. So you pretty much are forced to play someone behind the person and give up your defense like that. Then they might pass to someone retreat repeat.

1609429,0,t3_2cqgqn,Yeah. NHL is the worst game theyve released thus far. They introduced a new enforcer engine which was absolutely pointless. It forces your player to get paralysis while someone skates from across the rink to fight you. Not only do you have sit for min. They instigator isnt awarded that penalty.Also they introduced one touch dekes which with the push of one button and push of one direction of the left thumb stick the puck carrier can deke with no effort.Anothing introduction was left stick hitting. Basically you just run into the guy n deliver some sort of physical contact.To sum it up NHL was dumbed down to the point where it looks and feels like an arcade game. Not the simulation they advertised it as.Thia years installment was made strictly for people who dont play much or were terrible in years past versions. They made the game require little or no skill to play and be better than average.They also reduced the poke checking effectiveness and forgot about the defensemen yet again. Putting all the emphasis on offense.HUT is all they focus on. There hasnt been a solid tuner or update all year. They made their last gameplay update around Christmas time and it produced an exploit with dumping the puck in. The puck now bounces about  straight up in the air after it makes initial contact with the ice. Another way to screw over defensemen.Its August and they continually make new HUT cards and sell packs.HUT is extremely laggy and unplayable for the most part.The game is pure garbage n it suprises me the influx of positivity NHL is receiving. Yes it looks great visually and should play better on new gen but Im very optimistic until I actually play it and after tunersupdates that could ruin the gameplay will be made. Unless defenseman can play on an equal level and have the same tools to succeed as the forwards have this game will be a major disappointment.In my opinion you just cant polish a turd.,EA_NHL,cji1ava,-8,t5_2ry2z

2529647,0,t3_2olnvq,In reply to the Youtubers promoting the coin sellers it is because the coin sellers are paying them with coins for their pack openings or to get players to help the youtuber make more entertaining videos.  In turn since the Youtuber is gaining views the coin selling website is getting more advertising that many players find an interest in.As for your question FIFA hasnt really done anything to stop the coin sellers.  Yes EA hates it but there is no way to track what accounts on XBL or PSN that are working for the coin sellers.  Coin sellers use PayPal for the transaction with the customer and then the seller uses a personal XBLPSN account to carry out the deal which involves the buyer to post a playercontract for the seller to buy with the amount of coins the player bought.  The transaction can happen in a matter of seconds which makes it impossible for anyone to even realize it even happened.Its a very shitty thing to do but many games have the pay to win mentality EA is guilty of it by charging for packs that arent guaranteed to give you a decent player at all.  Some players want to spend an extra  on a couplehundred K of coins to buy the players they want rather than grind away playing hours and hoping to get them in packs or using trading methods.  Other players like myself enjoy the grind and the trading.  The only way for EA to really do away with this is to take out the transfer market entirely something that would definitely deter a lot of people away as it would solely rely on pack luck to have a good team.TLDR Coin selling is almost impossible to enforce as it is very easy to do and get away with.,EA_NHL,cmorepd,2,t5_2ry2z

3065892,0,t3_2v8dwg,Theres no such thing as ice tilt. Everything in the game comes down to player skill and human skill. There is momentum. Make a good play win a fight score a goal your players are going to get more energy. Players dont start skating faster and playing better because you are losing. The momentum system might be fucked up but thats about it. It might give players momentum based on little shit that shouldnt actually give momentum. Thats probably the only possibility. There has been absolutely no evidence that there is ice tilt. None. The only ice tilt discussions on this sub are text posts and post game stats. No videos. If you want to show me video evidence of ice tilt go ahead. People think that the number of shots and possession time winning. Thats not even close to being true. Good shots from good positions  goals. You can hold onto the puck as long as you want you can take as many shots that go straight to the goalie as you want but that doesnt mean you should score. A guy can play amazing defense the whole game and shut down every chance at a goal. He can have a possession time of one minute the whole game and have a shot total of . If he takes  good shots and those go in vs. your  shitty shots that have no way of going in the opponent is going to win. Bad play  losses. No matter what. You can win every game if you play it right. But blaming the game for ice tilt wont help you win.

I dont see a ton of shorthanded goals from me or the CPU I cant even think of the last shorthanded goal that happened.Ill have an odd powerplay or game where I cant get anything done on it and the CPU will just pressure me into oblivion and I can barely get poor shots off but those seem to be in the minority.For the most part Im able to cycle and set up unless Im frustrated or cocky and not playing smart. I can almost always cycle between defensemen and if that lane gets covered a winger is usually open. I usually like to try and skate behind the net passing back to the blue line if I cant or dont think Ill be able to get behind and go for a onetimer on a crosscrease pass.Every now and then Ill get a great powerplay where I get multiple shots off during an attack but I think  shots per powerplay is the usual not that thats bad considering the time scaling.Ill keep a better eye on powerplays and shots on powerplays in future games.

3659525,0,t1_cq9dikj,Yea ... its rigged by design favoring those who paytowin.  But being new to this version of NHL Im also trying to figure out the hidden metrics that the programmers put in there  you know stuff like if youre playing the computer and have a shutout  the computer will go into overdrive the last minute to get a goal. Or goals always happen in quick succession  depending on certain circumstances. Or how players cannot hit an empty net unless they are at least  feet in front of it. What Im coming to conclude is this version of EA NHL heavily favors deking and you will have to deke heavily so that shots go in  regardless of whether the shots are high quality on their own. I mean its just crazy I just played another game where Im shooting what by hockey standards would be really REALLY high quality close shots and rebounds and getting NO GOALS.If you dont deke alot and tick that box in the metrics the programmers make the goal an iron impassable gate. Its not really hockey. Its dekesturbating.,EA_NHL,cq9etem,2,t5_2ry2z

It at least gives me someone to track through those long years.  Its also interesting to see when NHLers retire and where their overall drops to before they do.  I recall in my NHL  one that Joe Thornton stuck around until  and dropped to a  overall before retiring whereas Ovechkin retired at around .In that year it was really hard to find good players because of the way that game handled player development.

You basically start with an outward deke hold the puck there and whip a wrist shot top shelf from a few certain spots on the ice and it goes in most of the time.debate will rage on about whether or not theyre cheese they are and people will post youtube videos of a player scoring from that location and suggest that thats evidence that its realistic.,EA_NHL,cs6ewbb,5,t5_2ry2z

4797905,0,t1_ctyw6kb,Ill take the guys who understand the virtual hockey mechanics and strategy over IRL hockey strategy any day of the week when playing a video game.  The only basic things that carry over from a sport to the video game is Communication Teamwork Positioning and Spacing.  All the little nuances of the sport is done for us.  If you understand those  things you dont need to know much about the sport itself minus the rules offsides icing etc. to be successful.As for shooting vs. a turnover shooting should definitely be the option if those are the only choices.  But between shooting or maintaining puck possession and waiting even to an abnormal amount of time.  Id rather hold the puck and keep moving the defense around.  Its not smart to shoot in the game for the sake of shooting.oh we cant break them down.  Well if your team has been able to hold onto the puck why settle for the weak shot when you can keep moving the puck around?  If it comes down to a turd vs. turnover a minute later take the shot and its  less minute they have with the puck.  The more you have the puck the less time theyll have to score and get antsy.As for random shots going in once again thats more realism generated by an RNG the will my goalie Fup RNG and less control given to the player when deciding a game.  If realism needs to be lowered or taken away for the sake of increased player control that NEEDS to happen for a competitive video game atmosphere.  We need as much control over the outcome as possible.,EA_NHL,ctzbcmg,2,t5_2ry2z

The last roster update was the October file shortly after the season began and we havent gotten anything like the last NHL  patch.  on  overtime seems like a simple thing EA could have built into the game in anticipation of the rule change it seemed very likely it was going to happen and then implemented with a software patch but it was obvious from the beginning that Legacy was nothing more than a quick cash grab from last gen players.To be fair they devoted the time and resources to get some new uniforms and arena names in including all the new AHL teams logos jerseys and affiliations plus they added the same goal horns and licensed songs NHL  had at launch. And I knew what I was getting when I bought Legacy on sale mind you as I hadnt purchased one since NHL  and most of my hockey gaming is modded NHL  on PC. But all that doesnt make it any better for the unaware consumer or loved one who buys a copy and finds a mostlylazy cashin made to squeeze the bit of money from last gen players.

I find there are far more horrible human goalies. But youre right that they seem to quit less. Instead that just drives everyone else to quit after youre not just down in a  hole or worse but on two goals that never shouldve happened. Its like youre playing with a handicap. And levels are the same no matter what position you play right? Like if you got to level  before you played goalie for the first time and then chose goalie youd show as being level  right? So oddly I feel like maybe  of the time theres a goalie at lev . I realize everyone starts somewhere but come on. Is that a glitch? Or does goalie have its own level system? Whats really interesting is how often a goalie will let in a horrible goal like where they were on the entirely wrong side of the crease or just blatantly out of position and not playing the angle right at all and people will actually give the goalie a pass and blame the defense. As the last line of defense the goalie cant prevent a play from developing but if they dont even come close to a respectable attemptsave or notthen its not the defense to blame.

It was that way because they didnt bother to get back the staff they lost and they didnt want to have to pay them anyway  when people are going to buy your product anyway because its the only one why pay more guys to produce quality when you can just keep that money?EA doesnt give a shit about making a quality product. They give zero shits whether or not you enjoy it. There are only two things that matter to EA and those things are separating you from  every year and doing everything in their power to try to get you playing their Microtransaction Ultimate Team mode. I wouldnt be surprised if those other modes were shit by design to try to get you to spend your time and hopefully money on the one mode they actually put effort into  Microtransaction Ultimate Team.These guys are shysters and they will lie to you by omission in order to take your money. They could have told you before the release that GM Mode didnt let you manage your AHL team or even let you pick who your team drafts but they waited until you had already given them your preorder money. Last years Ask EA NHL was rife with halfanswers to cherrypicked questions to make it seem like they gave a shit about something other than ensuring that they take  from the maximum number of people and again they gave hardworking hockey fans garbage.Its the only hockey game out there so by all means buy it if you have to but I strongly advise anyone whos interested not to preorder it and to wait until after the release to make absolutely certain this game is worth the money in your own opinion.

Similar to the way Madden or The Show has their franchise records set up. I think the game mode would get a lot more playability if we could chase Gretzkys points record with our favourite player or try to take Montreals title for most Stanley cups. It seems like such an easy addition it always frustrates me when they dont add it.. World Cup absolutely also for be a pro mode. A version of the world juniors not sure licensing issues here as a developmental prospects tournament. Better and more diverse ways to develop prospects I should be able to pick if a player should train specific stats . Scouting there needs to be a points system so I can see the type of production the prospective player is putting up. A draft combine would also add some depth to the currently shallow process that is the draft. Contracts No trademovement clauses also certain guys who will take hometown discounts play for less to be a part of a winner. Add advanced stats so much of the new NHL is based around analytics it would be cool to see it implemented in the new game . Coaches staff if my team finishes last place I need a scapegoat to get ownership off my back. Let me fire  hire coaches. Let me hire better scouts. Let me hire better training staff. . Player coaches if I have a guy with leader morale who wants to retire I should be able to hire him as an assistant coach. . Get rid of morale and bring back line chemistry. . Let me retire a players number if he retires and he had significant contributions to my teamI find myself always playing  years in franchise before starting a new one.

Also make sure you dont fuck yourself over on the breakout. Typically I have a winger skate in and I pass the puck back to the center just entering the zone so I can use him to either pass to an open winger on the boards or pass back to the point to set up a bomb clapper or give myself some time for the wingers to get a good position I havent played online broke high school student but doing all these things helped me play well against the superstar AI ,EA_NHL,dd0kimj,5,t5_2ry2z

10537589,0,t1_dd2ceur,I have a few minutes now so Ill explain it better. First off Ill tell you this game has always had a problem with short passes. If a teammate is a step in front of you it is really easy to pass to hard for him to pick up. Many many breakaways have been lost due to the fact that its inexplicably difficult to head man the puck to a teammate  feet away. The deke pass as we have come to call it has been our solution to this problem for a couple years now.Assuming youre a right handed shooter and you are trying to head man the puck to a teammate who is a step infront of you to your  oclock. Put your right stick to  oclock and hold it there as you pass. This does a couple things. It puts a little more distance between your stick blade and your recipients stick blade hopefully negating the issue I described above. It also changes the angle of the pass so it is less likely to hit his skate. Most importantly it sets your feet and puts you into a glide or coast. Everything you do with the puck especially passing is more accurate when you stop churning your legs.Conversely moving the right stick to  oclock before passing will pass the puck off of your backhand. I usually use a forehand pass to pass to the right and a backhand pass to pass to the left. The mechanics get a little tricky because you are pushing both sticks in opposite directions. Its just something you have to practice and develop the muscle memory for.Pro tip  If you bring the right stick down to  oclock before passing you will perform the most underutilized yet most satisfying play in the game the slap pass.,EA_NHL,dd2jw6b,1,t5_2ry2z

10592842,0,t3_5rjv8v,Its not just protect puck. I didnt realize this until I played a friend recently and he was wondering why he cant hit me. Thats when I noticed I would avoid or weaken a hit so I couldnt be bumped off the puck by turning my back and moving with the hit since hitting power is heavily momentum based. and then if im hit from behind and lose the puck Id be in the better position to pick it back up. Also if Im about to be hit from the left for example Id use right stick to stickhandle to the right side so the defender still has to go through me to get the puck. Protect puck is what I use only when I try to drive the net.,EA_NHL,dd8kiuh,1,t5_2ry2z

We then got stuck in some infinite stadium loading loop after the period. We waited  mins thinking the other team would just quit giving us the win. Wrong we ended up quitting not wanting to wait anymore. We get a  loss for quitting and had to start over some real bullshit.  When the night was over we looked at the clubs records they had one  games in a row on  disc wins. So they clearly practiced glitching before he playoffs then glitched through them.,EA_NHL,dgv47ry,6,t5_2ry2z
