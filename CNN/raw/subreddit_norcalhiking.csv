3421425,0,t1_cpi7eee,Wow thank you very much! I cant believe I missed that whole section of the trail report  thats what I get for skimming. I agree that whole area sounds pretty dismal and unmaintained.I have not been up there before but the area looks amazing. I was looking for some longer secluded sections for a  day trip but most of the trails I was able to find were short enough to do in a couple days or seemed to be heavily traveled. Im going to hit up the REI in Mountain View since someone told me someone who works there has been all over that area but if you or anyone else has other suggestions for longer trips in Trinity Alps Im very interested.,norcalhiking,cpi9n0k,1,t5_2u8kv

4669733,0,t3_3eoejr,Heres a map of our National Forests Look towards far northeastern California. Thats seclusion out there. Its called Modoc National Forest. The far east of that National Forest is the Warner Mountain Ranger District. They manage Warner Mountain Wilderness. You wont find a campground in the Wilderness area but heres the list of the campgrounds in their district  Heres one of them. Its free down a rough dirt road in an obscure location far from cities and its at a somewhat random trailhead Google it. You wont find much.Use these principals to find a world of public lands.,norcalhiking,ctj67x4,3,t5_2u8kv
5214890,0,t1_cvaxq4w,I was just at Sykes hot springs for Labor Day weekend. Very crowded and there was trash at the camp sites and used toilet paper off trail. It was very disappointing to see the trash. Hot springs are more pleasant and less crowded in winter season. ,norcalhiking,cvel5pu,1,t5_2u8kv

6275184,0,t3_410zha,Another option is Point Reyes particularly Wildcat and Coast Camp. Sky Camp down to Coast and shuttle back is kinda nice too.Angel Island has several camps you can hike to although they arent exactly on a beach although the ridge sites arent far from them.If you dont mind pesky rodents and staying in a cabin the classic NorCal choice is one of the cabins at Steep Ravine. You could backpack up to PanToll then down to Steep Ravine. Rocky shore but Muir Beach isnt far away you could also backpack from PanToll down to the Pelican Inn but thats kinda cheating.In Redwood NP you can backpack to Nickel Creek which is near the beach. In Prairie Creek you can backpack to a hikerbiker site at Gold Bluffs adjacent to the regular campground there.Ive known people who backpacked the coast from Russian Gulch north to Fort Ross but there isnt much beach if any at high tides. And I dont know anyone whos stayed there since that couple was murdered just south of there on the beach.Note that none of these suggestions are technically wilderness since that is pretty scarce on beaches even aside from boating and other uses.Oregon has coastal trails but as in CA youre not always on the coast. They have lots of campgrounds on the beach and all AFAIK have hikerbiker sites. So you might be able to link up some. Again not super wildernessy but so what? You could probably camp out in the dunes but would have to avoid the OHV areas. You could go Humbug to Pt Orford to Cape Blanco to Bandon mostly on the beach.,norcalhiking,cz2x1o8,3,t5_2u8kv

7406877,0,t1_d2jxung,Yeah Summit Springs TH is the best I think. I havent done the northern trails into Milk Ranch. I misspoke earlier regarding the spring  miles. Cedar camp has a pond that you can filter. I would move to the creek that is flowing off the pond though to get cleaner water. Ive never stayed at Bright Hollow Springs honestly. Heres my usual itinerary. Day one to Cedar camp. You will be at elevation and its all uphill from summit.Day two I hike West from Cedar camp to Milk Ranch. This is a few up and down sections but a enjoyable hike. Milk Ranch has water.Day three I head north east from Milk Ranch to the summit. Youll hit the ridge and you can check out both the North and South peaks although the northern one is easier and probably less snowy. And then back to Cedar camp passing the Bright Hollow trail junction and continuing back to the Summit Spring TH. This way your last day is mostly downhill except for about one mile from in the early morning from Milk Ranch to the Ridge where the trail junction for both North and South peaks. Basically I do the trail is the opposite direction you are suggesting. From Cedar camp to the peaks is a lot of uphill instead of Cedar camp to milk Ranch which is up and down. ,norcalhiking,d2k43jt,3,t5_2u8kv
7642173,0,t3_4jnoa5,What? nobody mentioned the Dipsea in Mill Valley and over to the coast? lotsa steps to start.Briones has some steep firetrail as does Las Trampas the ridge is great. Redwood has some incline but I prefer the rolling French trail. Nice forest. Also Morgan Territory Black Diamond Mines and Walnut Creek Open Space. Shell Ridge. Lime Ridge.Within  minutes of Concord you can find enough for every weekend for a year pretty much. All these trails in the EB link up there are regular  mile races from say Chabot more steep to Wildcat and back. Oh yeah Huckleberry and Sibley and Tilden too.Just go to ebparks.org and start downloading maps.For a personal fave do the north side of Mt D right now. Say up past Mitchell Rock and up Eagle Peak and down to Murchio then say right down to Deer Flat and then up to the summit. Then down to Devils Elbow and down from there several routes I like going back to Murchio although going over to the falls trails might be nice now.,norcalhiking,d3avg1g,1,t5_2u8kv

8116000,0,t3_4plep9,So I did about  mile hike...a GPS monitor is definitely next on my gear list.Looped from Hq going counter clock wise up to sunset camp  checked out the first two waterfalls and then landed at berry Creek. imho I believe this was the better choice of hike. Kinda made a grand finale when hitting berry Creek.  After the falls I went past the trail back to Hq and decided to take the strenuous Howard King up to Mt. McCabee. Great choice I loved the challenge.  Overall driving to HQ sucked. Especially compared to the straight shot down highway . I think the only time Id do HQ again is to do Pine Mountain  I just cant see any other practical way of getting there. Thanks for all the advice and input. Hike was amazing.  Oh and make sure you bring some mosquito repellent ,norcalhiking,d4sb8c0,1,t5_2u8kv

8970280,0,t1_d7pzwp9,I take all necessary precautions against it. With that being said I believe I am one of the  who it doesnt effect. I have read that one can lose this immunity with more exposure. I am careful. My hiking partner SO gets it really bad. With due care even on overnights hiking through overgrown trails where you must brush past it she doesnt contract it.    Depending on your definition of weed and your outlook then sure it can fit the description. MW it fits if you dont like the plant. But the definition that pops up on Google when you type it in doesnt fit. However I sort of admire the plant. It has evolved a pretty amazing defense mechanism and it is native to our area. When I read the definition it doesnt fit for me.    If you have serious problems with poison oak here it what I recomend. Obviosuly familiarize yourself with the difference between poison oak and blackberries. Wear gators over pants everywhere you hike. Be careful with removing them and washing them and store them apart in their own bag. Bring a washcloth that is used only for this purpose. Bring a small amount of bio degradable soap with you as well. Follow LNT and get as far away from water sources as you can. I think you are supposed to go  feet but I try to go further. Then wash anywhere that could have been exoosed. You dont need much soap but you need a lot of friction. Spend  scrubbing the hell out of yourself and your gear and anything that could have touched either your legs or your gaitors. If you follow this advice you will not have problems. Yeah its a lot of work but its part of our amazing State.,norcalhiking,d7q3b1v,1,t5_2u8kv

10290960,0,t3_5n9jm4,Unless a person has spent a significant amount of time travelling throughout California its amazing variety of ecologies is not appreciated. California has the greatest variety of ecological zones and elevations of any other state. It is certainly not primarily a desert. It contains deserts but also temperate rainforest mixed conifer forest alpine grassland savanna coastal etc etc. The eastern woodlands are much like the mixed conifer forests of the sierra foothills or areas farther north near Mt. Shasta. We live at  feet elevation in a forest of douglas fir red cedar big leaf maple dogwood several oak species ponderosa sugar and grey pine. The topography itself is not as broad and undulating as the east more up and down with steep canyons but the vegetation can be very similar.  For anyone who thinks California is only desert come to the mountains rivers and lakes of far northern California you will be amazed.,norcalhiking,dcajb7k,6,t5_2u8kv
10550700,0,t3_5r2xfr,You have a lot of choices.Are you backpacking in or car camping? If car camping Lodgepole and crescent Meadow are both in SEKI. Its the park hub so be prepared to face a lot of tourism I dont know when you plan on going. They have the giant sequoias theres running water. A river. And even a small store. Plus free in park transit. There are tons of car accessible sites in the ponderosa area and johnsondale area that have what your looking for. These are not NP but rather sequoia national forest. Redwood Meadow campground is in the Giant Sequoia Grove Trail of  Giants. Not sure about water though. About  minutes from there  you have Lower peppermint campground. Theres also a series of  first come first served free campgrounds along Forest Route S these all have creeks running nearby with plenty of swimming. And Johnsondale has a small General store as well. ,norcalhiking,dd41gmz,1,t5_2u8kv
