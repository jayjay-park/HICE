And if we continue ignoring the racists theyll get fewer and fewer in number.gtTake away the places where racists have to get together and discuss it. Because that goes over so well. Look at how FPH responded. Did they go away? The answer is a resounding FUCK NO.gtHuman psychology this up  if people cant get together to discuss how much they hate X the average hate level for X will not increase from group polarization.Lets apply human psychology to this for real An already mocked extremely small subset of a community is widely viewed to be moronic and outrageous.

4769903,0,t1_ctvs9ig,Let me grab something from a sub I mod...You can see the red boxes show both the link submission itself and the separate comment were removed. It also specifies in this particular case that AutoModerator is the one that removed them and did so without marking them as spam.In that particular posts case the submission was removed by AutoMod. The submission could have been removed for a couple reasons that matched this particular post. It included a phone number that rule is in place to try and prevent users from posting their CPNI Customer Proprietary Network Information in public places. The users account was also less than a day old to help prevent trolls with new alt accounts or users circumventing a ban. The comment was removed because of the account age. It stayed removed after we manually reviewed AutoMods action as we do with all AutoMod actions when we have the time because the posts only purpose was to solicit for members to join their plan something we dont allow.From the userside they wouldnt see a highlighted box of course thats a visual indicator for the mods to know whats been removed when looking through submissions and comments.I do have both RES and Mod Toolbox installed one of them might be doing this specifically instead of it being a redditnative feature but from a mod perspective theyre invaluable since the builtin reddit tools are lacking one of the primary reasons the blackout happened in the first place if you remember.,Blackout2015,ctvsfkw,7,t5_38x0w

6634025,0,t1_d051syw,The the problem is when giving this bit of advice theyre making the assumption that the inactive mods will be below the active mods when in reality its almost certain to be the other way around the majority of the time. People found subreddits become mods of subreddits then as time passes their interests change and their free time grows less they stop going to or using those subreddits or stop visiting reddit entirely. Or people who enjoy being a mod become mod of dozens of subreddits just to spend their time dealing with only a few of them over the years. The combination of the two result in it being almost guaranteed that the dead weight in the mod list will be at the top of the list rather than near the bottom of the list.  So when the admins advise that inactive mods be purged they look to be cluelessly out of touch. As though they arent even aware theres a problem.  Which is pretty sad as this is a problem which should be relatively easy to mitigate. A change as simple as enabling active moderators to remove any mod from the list who hasnt logged into reddit for  months would be a helpful minimum. Going as far as enabling active moderators to remove any mod from the list who hasnt visited the subreddit while logged in for  months would probably eliminate the problem entirely.
