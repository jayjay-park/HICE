224235,0,t1_cf3fx7n,Let me take a shot at an answer a bit more conventional description than you get from Peter. Plumbutter is a collection of patchable modules that make up an unusual type of drum machine. Two sections are for pulse generation the  Rollz which are voltage controlled LFOs and the pulse sequencer. Modules to be excited by pulses are AVDog and Gongue. Plus two Ultrasonic filters and a Deerhorn. AVDog Gongue and Deerhorn have complex internals. They also have external inputs you can use. AVDog consists of a VCO and a stereo envelope shaper that is controlled by a low frequency rung filter that produces an envelope which is the distinct characteristic of AVDog. The external input also goes into the shaper. AVDog outputs are White and Red and the envelope out is Orange. Gongue is a VCF with a triggering circuit to ring it producing bongolike sounds. However you can send an external audio in and just use the CV input Violet to make it function in a more standard way. Deerhorn is a manual controller with a stereo VCA and two VCOs. It also has an external input so you can send audio through the VCA instead of hearing the VCOs. The outputs of the above modules are available both for patching and through the internal mixer. Ultrasound uses a high frequency VCO to mangle up other sounds. The signal out is only available through the mixer. But you can get the raw VCO output Yellow. I hope that wasnt too redundant.this is the most conventional answer you will getit is part of a large thread that can be found here,modular,cf3zht6,1,t5_2qzdf

1230558,0,t3_286jbx,In my experience its hard to love every module a single manufacturer puts out. And the best thing about eurorack is you dont have to! For example I love much of what makenoise puts out but couldnt gel with Rene. If you insist on a complete system from one vendor I think makenoise would be  the safest bet as their modules have been used and validated by many interesting artists over the past few years. However the appeal for many modular users is that you can create your own instrument by mixing and matching modules from various sources rather than depending on one manufacturer to provide that vision for you. So unless youre picky about having a very consistent look among your modules Id recommend not limiting yourself to one manufacturer. Every major manufacturer out there has put out at least a couple of modules that will be just right for you. ,modular,ci82005,6,t5_2qzdf

While its obviously not the best keyboard being a bit clicky and having no velocity sensitivity or anything its surprising how much it helps to be able to play something thats really close to hand when wiring up a patch. Ninas taking the bottom left Stepper Acids gate out and feeding it into the kick drum module and using its accent out for the snare.  The bottom right Stepper Acids gate out is being sent to the hihat module.  So basically shes abusing the gate and accent outputs as triggers.  Ive told her this is confusing to do in demonstration videos but she points out how its nice when the demo music is actually fully fledged music with a beat.  So thats the thinking behind that one.

2730695,0,t1_cncwcnp,Scaling up a modular system is really hard.  Over the years Ive come to admire how Doepfer splits up the functionality of its modules.For example people rag on the A spring reverb for not having voltage control.  Though it doesnt need it!  If you want to have VC mix use the A dual cross fader... and now you also have the ability to cross fade two other things independent of spring reverb mix.  In comparison one could spend a lot more on an Intellijel Springray and not have this modularity and usefulness.This basic idea spreads across the entire system.  Its possible to get so much ability and modularity which ultimately supports future scaling needs.If not starting with a Doepfer system keeping these ideas in mind.  While it is useful to get dense multifunction modules like MATHS and the Triple Bipolar VCA one cant avoid getting dedicated variants of what these things do cross faders offset attenuators slew sample and hold linear bipolar mixer ring modulators etc.Though directly to your question the new Doepfer basic oscillator is a fantastic place to start.  The HP is low and the functionality is good not to mention they are cheap.  After that and after you have the basics stuff mentioned above getting a more special case complex oscillator is a good idea.  Just my  cents.This is my systemFunctionally it is very dense.  Almost every module can be used for like  different things and I built it this way on purpose.  While this saves rack space it hurts when patching.  I almost can never work the RES into a patch because it would otherwise consume all my VCAs and offset attenuators notice the lack of VC attenuators on the panel.Im now spending the next year rolling back this quest to compact the modular and am looking to get more single use modules.One other thing for Doepfer.  I like how most modules are either    or  HP.  That makes it very easy to line up a rack.  Total silly. ,modular,cnegvjs,2,t5_2qzdf

3481754,0,t3_3018cc,Seems like you took a similar approach to the one I took. I also started from a knowledge of synthesis and using it to write musical works. And your rack is similar to what I did its basically a traditional subtractive synthesizer.The danger in that is you might find yourself using it in a sort of more traditional ways and start to find it somewhat limiting. Basically you might just end up using it like a traditional synth.I think its a really good starter setup for you to expand on. I really really really recommend getting into MakeNoise modules when you start expanding. As others described about the Maths most Make Noise modules are built with a whole bunch of different functions available and lend themselves to being used in new unconventional ways in interesting combinations.I dont have the Maths but adding the MakeNoise Function and modDemix modules into my rig has completely changed the way I use it.,modular,cpp58pn,2,t5_2qzdf

That said you could spend even less money and go for only one VCA instead of the dual VCA and only one envelope instead of the quadADSR.I like the above suggestion because the QuadADSR already gives you so much room for creative experiments but keep in mind that one or two envelopes would be totally sufficient in the beginning. Regarding filters a lowpass filter is great and common to start with. You should also look at the A which has a slightly different cutoff slope of  dBoctave instead of  dBoctave with the A.Edit Also keep in mind that if you want to play your synth via keyboard you either need a keyboard with CVoutput or a MIDItoCV module like the A.,modular,ctiugyk,2,t5_2qzdf

5742447,0,t3_3tsjty,gt Does this damage it in any way?No.gt is the uVCA II analog?Yes.gt If so would the distortion be analog distortion?Short answer Yes. Long answer Im assuming youre referring to the difference between clipping and saturation since while both lead to distortion effects they arent necessarily the only way of producing analogdigital distortion. Lets have a short look at whats the difference between clipping and saturation First you need to understand how digital modules interpret audio signals Any input signal is first sent to a analog to digital converter ADC. Basically the ADC will take samples of the incoming voltage many times per second. There is a specified range of voltages that are sampled by the ADC say for example it can sample anything between v and v. If a signal goes lower or higher than that specified range it will simply register as v or v  so the internal representation of the signal will be cut off at the v mark like so Thats called clipping.Overdriving analog circuitry will instead often lead to saturating effects. Analog circuits also have maximal amplitudes they are specified for but if a signal goes above that amplitude the signal wont be cut off right there. Instead it will be compressed down a bit such that the part above the maximum amplitude will not be quite as loud as it should be e.g. if you send in v the circuit might transform that to .v and if you send in v it might only go up to v  it does not necessarily scale linearly. Both create additional harmonics but most people find the results of analog saturation much more appealing than that of digital clipping which is much harsher.,modular,cx8wmo8,18,t5_2qzdf

9058841,0,t3_5407ai,When you are just starting out with building a modular focus on starting with one full voice. Sound source sound shaper a couple VCAs and some CV sources envelopes LFOs sequencers whatever you want. Then you can build on this basic voice as you learn how to use it and can better understand what else you need.Personally I also like to have an audio output module in the rack while not strictly necessary its very convenient for getting signal from your modular into your audio interface or mixer or whatever.So using the modules you listed as an example you can accomplish this like soSource Either Braids or ShapeshifterShaper Clouds more of an FX module really  a traditional shaping stage would be a filter or wavefolder  Shapeshifter has a folder built inVCA Intellijel uVCA or Makenoise Optomix for LPGstyle I dont like LPGs as my only VCAs but some people do itCV MathsOptional output Intellijel Audio Interface II or Pittsburgh OutsAlso while the Shapeshifter is one of my favorite modules I warn you that it is pretty complex and rewards careful patching since its pretty easy to turn into a hurricane of noise. There is a great video tutorial series on Youtube but expect to spend a few hours sitting down with those and working your way through them to help you get to grips with it. Like most of the Mutable Instruments stuff Braids is more conducive to screwing around without really understanding the module.Also both Shapeshifter and Braids are powerful enough that you could skip a shaper type module entirely if you wanted or if youre on a tight budget but I think it would be the next purchase to make as this kind of sourcegtshapegtfx flow is pretty much the essence of synthesis IMO.,modular,d80q6z3,2,t5_2qzdf

9431675,0,t1_d9beyed,yea I mean again its largely up to whatever it is you want to do with your system. like what kind of music you want to make. I dont have a M so Im not fully aware of all its features but right now you are mostly setting up extra modulation options. the one thing you are kind of lacking is triggers. I assume the M has a gate out tied to the sequencer. and thats all well and good if you want to trigger Peaks. but one thing you can do is use square wave LFOs from the Batumi and it could be really cool when you consider that one mode of the batumi is to have the  LFOs setup to be timed dvisions of the rate of the first one. again you can do lots of things but lets say you are at least A adding a second VCO to the M and B also adding a ton of super interesting modulation options. Remeber that VCAs also work with CV not just audio. So having what you could call a timed release of CV like you are turning on and off a faucet is always really awesome. ,modular,d9bj2uw,2,t5_2qzdf

10692528,0,t1_ddhvvr9,VCA is not only for audio. You can use VCA to create new and more variable modulators from your existing ones. For example take an LFO send it to VCA input and use another unipolar LFO in CV input. Now you have a new modulation source that has frequency of LFO but its amplitude would vary with frequency of LFO. Or you can use an envelope with slow attack instead of LFO and then resulting modulation would gradually become audible only when EG receives gate. Without VCA your modulations are all too static.I think Cold Mac is a pretty cool module but may be hard to understand at first. Its less specialized than Toolbox so can be used in more cases.,modular,ddiusx7,1,t5_2qzdf
