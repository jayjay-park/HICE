I know that all of the portrait DLC Convent Charlemange Way of Life The Old Gods and Legacy of Rome work fine today during our round.I left all of the Content Packs Horse Lords Rajas of India Sunset Invasion Reapers Due and Sword of Islam all disabled.We played for a good couple of hours before my friends favorite son was assassinated by a rival Count regarded as a Nika in our realm and he had to go to bed.... more like cry himself to sleep haha.,Ck2Generator,d7n9nbu,3,t5_3g8aq

9005389,0,t1_d7uajyj,Is it really that simple? Ive tried looking through the CB file and the dependencies for everything in there seemed really daunting.But if its just adding a couple of lines that seems pretty manageable. Maybe it would be easy for uyemmlie to implement an ifthen where it checks if a given religion has a religious headinvasions and if not it adds the religion to the county conquest CB list. I dunno if its possible or even manageable to implement though and Im already amazed at everything this mod accomplishes,Ck2Generator,d7ub2tt,1,t5_3g8aq
