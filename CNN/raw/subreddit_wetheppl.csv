7350009,0,t1_d2dlvka,I would be too that was why I only asked for zip codes. A direct address would be much better in figuring out every district you are in. It is not all readily available it takes lots of looking through websites and searches. Knowing which keywords to use for the each state and I feel like they make it hard on purpose.  www.ballotpedia.com is a great place to start for a general idea. Find all of your states site. Then you have to figure out what districts you are in and how many. In my state of California there are lots. Each district deals with different things. Then look that district up for each one.  If you want to go broader I can do just your states links and you can go from there.,wetheppl,d2dn9cd,6,t5_3dd4g
