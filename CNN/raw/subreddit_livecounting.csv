10828803,0,t1_ddwnnsy,Right. This feature should have a positive impact on most counters speeds. I would not consider myself as having fast internet see my run in rcounting I just had to adjust my counting technique to account for the lag. Even though I did the nd fastest k without remove submission lag this feature at least makes it more convenient to run quickly. Some of what I wrote is at least halftrue though for example that this feature could cause a rapid succession of live counting speed records. Co still has some bugs to work out from this feature. Finally I think the health effects are selfexplanatory though not unique to RSL. ,livecounting,ddwwxop,2,t5_3304m
