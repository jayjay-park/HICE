2409603,0,t1_cm9i7o7,Vancouverite here. For usual tourist awesomeness go to Stanley Park but bring an umbrella and rainjacket. Capilano suspension bridge is also lovely and not too far away from the main city core. Steveston in Richmond is a nice little heritage fishing area that is quite quaint. Grouse mountain is probably the more tourist friendly ski mountain in the lower mainland but if you are there to skiboard id say go to Cypress. Check the weather before you go. Make it to Whistler if you really want a good run. Drive around a lot enjoy the natural scenery and try new foods!,canadia,cm9jazj,3,t5_2qt7t
