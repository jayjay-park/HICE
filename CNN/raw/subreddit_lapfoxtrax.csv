317856,0,t3_1xpy88,One song that has a more open interpretations for me is This could have been nice.  The whole album broken core is about various forms of love and relationships.  I think that This could have been nice is about the progress of a chaotic and ultimately doomed relationship.Broken core starts with a pretty nice chorus... Something actually nice to be around.  It quickly is interrupted by quick and chaotic drums and beats though the original rhythm can still be heard.  In the middle of the song we hear a short reflection of the initial chorus before we dive back into chaos. However this time even the base music is distorted.  Even the nice things in the relationship have started to deteriorate.  By the end of the song there isnt any sort of structure left to the songrelationship deteriorating into a mess of loud and ugly beats and glitches.In summary songrelationship starts nice and pure and pretty.  The songrelationship then has some glitches and disharmony but the niceness still shines through. Despite one final effort midway through the song even the nice parts disintegrate into chaos.  Then the songrelationship ends.This song could have been nice.,lapfoxtrax,cfdpqu6,5,t5_2sdi3

1164091,0,t3_27g6k3, Do not trust too much on tutorials they serve as a base but you should not actually do always the exact steps on a tutorial. Always leave extra lots of room for your own way of working. Ren uses MODPlug Tracker and ACID and he uses MPT to compose the notes and piano roll samples and ACID to masterize assemble mix and compose the final songs so you might want to learn those programs if so. Other software you can use is Fruity Loops which is quite more complete and its easier to compose manually the chords. If you cant afford that software mentioned before theres open software to compose music around there I guess I dont know which and you might need to learn them at least. But depending on which software you use you can have it easier to compose or even produce more powerful stuff. There must be a ton on the net. MODPlug Tracker is free however. Be sure of the music genre that youre most comfortable with. Make your own sound at best. People are always looking for something different some variety depending on the situation and when you have a really solid different style than other artists name it Ren or Futret or whatever its easier to identify. Thats good when actually getting fans. I dont know if you need any for now but this should help,lapfoxtrax,ci0kvhi,8,t5_2sdi3

She originally kept this a secret from everyone except Mischief jokingly explaining that Kitsune is already giving this place a nerd overdose. Eventually though she stopped caring about keeping it a secret and even wore her glasses for the cover of Rider Super. This is based on an interpretation of the album art it looked like Mayhem wore glasses the first time I saw it. NegaRen and TBQF hold a little ahem tradition in early October to get hyped for Halloween the tradition in question is NSFW. They went a little overboard with it in . RQ was not happy in the slightest deciding to drastically shorten GO LUCKY and banning NegaRen from releasing an album that year.

8086390,0,t1_d4oncr5,Ren has already responded to you but Ill add my two cents anyway. This is sort of what Ive gathered. Its not that liking Rens old music is frowned upon so much as it is askingdemanding Ren stops making the music they want to right now and go back to making the music some fans of the old stuff want. This is something that Ive seen happen with artists musicians comic artists whatever whove had a nice longrunning career that has evolved over time. People who dont like the direction things have gone put down the artist for no longer appealing to their taste as though their desires are more important than the artists. ,lapfoxtrax,d4ozfko,2,t5_2sdi3

8419384,0,t3_4uxiar,there was a lot of demand people wanted them and i felt like supplying. if i were running out of money i would not pay the  upfront costs of making batches of cassettes in the first place lol especially considering the wait time on them is  months and youd be without that cash for the duration.albums are getting pressed again because i actually have a bit more money to get them made with not because i have less. im in a position to offer at least a few reprints throughout the year so i figure i might as well do it. i do not believe in designed scarcity i just press what im able to.the full low down on how physical stuff worksphysical releases do not net me a ton of money  they mostly pay to get more things made. as an example a release like this upon being completely sold can pay for two more releases give or take. then when i do those one gets funneled into savings and the other gets funneled into work  living. what actually keeps me making  things is patreon and digital sales. i do physical merch because i love it so i deal with the stress that comes with it especially on the shipping end of things i truly hate doing this hahaha. if i needed more money id never do em at all.,lapfoxtrax,d5tyscs,7,t5_2sdi3
