3461706,0,t3_2y7q0z,Iyaz makes sense to me with his comments on most things. Glad he is a part of The show. I get his point about increasing the speed to be efficient with his time. I have not tried it myself as I have plenty of time on my hands as a stay at home Dad.  I would also like to mention I am currently enjoying the Quest For Peace podcasts Iyaz did although I am struggling to get a feed for the initial episodes. My feed starts at episode  so I have missed the first  episodes! Can you please advise the best feed to pick all of these up on Podcast Addict. Thanks from the UK. Damian,the404,cpmuyep,1,t5_2sc8b
