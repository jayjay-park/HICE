8133,0,t3_1kskd3,If youre at all into Dustins solo stuff I HIGHLY suggest Noah Gundersen. He is absolutely amazing. I heard him first on Sons of Anarchy a few seasons ago and has a new much anticipated album coming out in mid February.,thrice,cefd1rm,1,t5_2snr1
240724,0,t3_1vdhb9,I love it. This is actually one of my favorite song of theirs. Thank you,thrice,cf5pb88,1,t5_2snr1
1857569,0,t3_28c8rf,Unfortunately they never released an official live version of this song. I was lucky to see them play it the third time I saw them. It was absolutely incredible. Considering how they completely redid it to make it more energetic its criminal that they never released an official version of it.,thrice,ckd163l,2,t5_2snr1
2478643,0,t3_2nw2ph,I wish I had kept track. Im thinking it leans towards . I know at least  of the Honda Civic tour with DashboardGet Up Kids back in the day.   in NJ  in CA. Pretty much anytime since  in GA.  of the farewell tour dates. Several over the years in Florida.  Plus Dustin solo a handful of times including last week lt ,thrice,cmi3h7z,2,t5_2snr1
2641690,0,t1_cn3afis,Yeah. I said below I want new material but I definitely would not want another MajorMinor. Ive tried over and over to like it but outside of maybe  songs I dont feel it. If it wasnt a Thrice album Id probably have listened to it once and forgotten about it. I enjoyed Beggars but I get what youre saying. I still have hope for new material since they never seem to do the same thing twice. ,thrice,cn3egf7,-1,t5_2snr1

3964489,0,t1_cr82mmc,One of the biggest mistakes I noticed was In Exile. Teppei didnt come in at the right time and Riley came in early and it was a mess. But they all laughed and Riley counted them back in and the song started anew. It was pretty great.,thrice,cr86of0,2,t5_2snr1

7030497,0,t1_d1d982r,I was just about to comment the same thing. Im pretty sure he does and thats why they obscure his vocals at the very end. Certainly brings an edge to their lyrics that hasnt been there.  I feel that swearing in lyrics should be used sparingly but it can add a lot when used in the right places.,thrice,d1d9eoy,1,t5_2snr1

7722439,0,t1_d3jz54f,I bought two hoodies and the vinyl and were flying from Utah to California to see them on June  and June . Woot! I think Thrice fans are most likely to actually financially support the band while ravenously gobbling up leaks.,thrice,d3jzlcl,2,t5_2snr1
7732986,0,t1_d3jh9nr,While it is great its fan service for those whove been with the band for  years to give them something more energetic.

7871197,0,t3_4n45og,I believe the floorboards creaking on The Alchemy Index Earth are the actual floorboards creaking from their selfmade studio.If you look at the video for Stare at the Sun at the end the band is playing in slow motion but sheets of paper are falling at normal speed. They achieved this by actually playing the song at x or maybe x the speed while having the sheets dropped from above.I cant substantiate this but I think the crackling effects at the beginning of The Messenger came from actually holding a mic into the fire? I remember reading that somewhere.The morse code at the beginning of The Image of the Invisible spells out Vheissu. It was meant to be longer because Dustin loved it but they decided to cut it down. Ill edit if I think of moream corrected!Edit There was a fan theory that the first three full albums displayed Dustins struggle and becoming disillusioned with his faith. This has been disproved by Dustin but its interesting to relisten to them with that in mind.Daedalus is the only mythological character to be mentioned twice by Thrice.The Red Death is based on Edgar Allan Poes Masque of the Red Death.The last song in each of the elements in Alchemy Index has the same format  a sonnet maybe? I cant remember but if you look at the lyrics its very easy to tell. Also each one is the literal element talking.Under a Killing Moon is inspired by the Crucible and the Salem trials.The way Paper Tigers transitions into Hoods on Peregrine will blow your socks off.Edit  As you wanted fan theories  ,thrice,d40smk8,10,t5_2snr1
7875178,0,t1_d417uft,I was in a church small group back in . My small group leader was good friends with the band. He told me that the name Thrice came from fans at their first couple of shows referring to them as three guys and a rice. I have no way to prove this however. ,thrice,d418qr0,1,t5_2snr1

8960979,0,t3_51fbat,All answers are correct but to really appreciate where they are now musically I would start all the way back at their first proper album Identity Crisis. If you can find it online maybe YouTube if its up start with their first EP First Impressions. This way you can appreciate how theyve changed and why people have kept such a diehard devotion to them over the years. Ive been listening to them since right before their second album came out. I wouldnt trade being around for almost all of the evolutions for anything. ,thrice,d7oz407,1,t5_2snr1

9585744,0,t1_d9udbmp,Ive wondered that but I usually hear the band emphasize that the lyrics are all Dustins.
