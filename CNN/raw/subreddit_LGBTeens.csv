181047,0,t3_1w65cv,This is exactly what many in the LGBT community dont want. Many dont want to be part of a minority or thought of as such. We should just be human living together and equal. It can be tempting to be part of a minority but this shouldnt even be a minority. Indirectly you imply probably by accident that its a choice to be part of the community or that people become LGBT to be a part of it. Personally no. I hate it. Even though I usually like being in a minority I still hate it. Im damn proud of figuring myself out and of others for going through things some cant even imagine but nobody wants to be a part of a minority that is hated by half the world. Ashamed? Not one bit.

You two can absolutely be friends removing the romantic feelings but itll take time.It might help or it might not but what if hypothetically he was gay but youre not his type not even close? I think its easy to trap yourself in an unhealthy romantic hole with him because you think If only he were gay as if thats the only obstacle holding back your unrequited love. But what if he were gay but you were incompatible?I think it may help to consider it like that. It might make it easier to accept that youll never regardless of what happens have that romantic relationship with him and therefore it might help you move on and simply enjoy the friendship sooner.Good luck and yes most of us have definitely been there before.

651007,0,t1_cge8kwb,One I didnt recommend bare backing Im saying it is an option if the right circumstances are taken beforehand. Im not misguided about STIs. Yes with barebacking a load may end up there if they dont pull out then you may douche as needed or any other form of method like pooping it out. Two I read somewhere douching too often removes beneficial bacteria from your intestines which can put you at a greater risk for something. Not sure if that was true but Im on mobile and cant link studies. Yes the lining flushing is healthy but I wouldnt go out and promote to douche on a daily or weekly basis. So yes douching in moderation is good but not too often. Three I think youre misguided on the poop philosophy I have. Youre sticking your dick up an asshole that excretes waste. Thats its purpose. If you get a little poop during the process or after yes its gross but it can easily be cleaned. Your comparison to childbirth is completely off the charts. It just further proves my point though its gross yes but move on and stop dawdling on the fact because its nature. Were all human and we should act like one.,LGBTeens,cge9plq,1,t5_2t8gr

894274,0,t3_24cnfq,Im going to be upfront and say that whether youre gay or bi or straight it really doesnt matter.  Labels are complicated you could be anything from a homosexual homoromantic to a bisexual heteroromantic or anythign in between.  Looking for labels before you understand yourself is a... bad idea.  It leads to a lot of problems some of which youve already apparently faced on some level No dammit Im a bisexual!  I have to look at girls equally!.So for your first problem heres my recommendation take a day or maybe two.  Do some stuff that isnt school and wont completely distract you.  Throw some ideas around in your head.  I wouldnt know myself but maybe you could throw ideas of what TRULY appeals to you around.  Figure out what attracts you NOT the term for what attracts you.  Once you know in your head what your thing is go look it up.  There are words for nigh on everything nowadays.From there realize that sexuality can be quite fluid especially during your transitional years we change a lot ESPECIALLY during our teens.  Maybe the title that fits you today wont fit tomorrow.  This isnt a onesizefitsall scenario.  Your tastes can change and if you really like titles you can change those titles with them.As for the second I dont really see an issue I can help with.  Being overweight isnt necessarily a problem romantically though it is generally bad for your health not facetious there are fat people healthier than skinny people.  Not many but....  The second... yeah got nothin.  Sorry.Either way good luck with your situations.  And have fun.  Fun makes the world go round.  Well fun and science.,LGBTeens,ch5xlpj,5,t5_2t8gr

1248471,0,t1_cia25dj,To expand upon that sexual attraction and romantic attraction are two different things. These things match for most people they are romantically attracted to the same gender theyd like to have sex with.Not everybody feels this way. In your case it may appear that youd be okay with sex with boys and girls alike but are only really romantically attracted to girls. Thats not a fault. Thats just how things turn out I guess.Its your responsibility and opportunity to figure out what youre going to do about it.But in the end does your label matter? If you feel attracted to someone and you feel comfortable about the whole thing just take that person for a spin and see where things end up. Responsibly so of course but its no sin to try out a romantic relationship with a boy if you were previously convinced that you were strictly heteroromantic.,LGBTeens,cia2ha7,5,t5_2t8gr

I know it sucks like really really sucks and it feels like youre accomplishing nothing when you get super worked up over saying something and all you get is cool and what was the english homework?

Me and my friend were trying to disguise it a little however we were drunk and they were sober. So they could have easily put two and two together. But Ill certainly take your advice I would never have thought of that myself so thanks. Yeah It was kinda annoying at the time and one of my friends stopped pushing me about it so that was nice. Them trying to persuade me to go has kinda died down at the moment but I still have no idea whether I want to go haha.Thats an amazing tip. Im going to try that and hopefully hell take it well and do what the first friend who I came out to who treated me no differently than he treated me before hand which was amazing.Thanks for the advice mate.

1375228,0,t3_29u66v,I suppose that I should answer my own question then no? Firstly and most importantly is personality. Id love someone who is carefree yet still able to be serious. By that I mean someone who I can have a laugh about but also still be helpful when I need it. I dont like overly masculine nor overly feminine guys but just normal. As in I dont like guys who act like girls but I also like guys who still arent afraid to show emotion. This is going to sound weird but I have a thing for foreign guys. Haha. Id love someone who could speak something other than just English and since I want to travel in my life it would be awesome to find someone willing to do that with me. Finally when it comes to looks Im not fussy. I love people with a nice smile and eyes though!,LGBTeens,cioo6xh,1,t5_2t8gr

So people automatically assume that Im gay simply by the way I express myself. Its a bit irritating to be honest because yknow Im not gay. Too bad I cant just wear a bracelet with the colors for pansexuals.

Not like the expectation of someone who is Bi is that they keep switching between the genders every relationship. Eventually you ideally would find the right person they will be whoever they are and it will be awesome. If you think it is more likely to be same sex great. I have always said gay because  of my feelings are towards guys but I would never rule out a girl. Maybe I am little bi. Everyone is all over the place.

I think a good way of thinking about it positively is to remember that they are always going to be happy with you regardless of whether you give them children. They may be slightly disappointed but they are never going to dislike you or stop loving you just for not having their grandchildren.Also remember being gay ! no children.

2480621,0,t3_2nz9qm,I came out about six months ago. I was talking with my then good friend and now girlfriend on facebook about how i was really confused about my sexuality and stance on religion. I was on my moms tablet. I forgot to log off. She saw it. The next day my dad sat me down and told me he loved me and such like but that being queer was an abomination and a sin. He also asked me not to be open about it.  I was pretty shook up. I wasnt ready to come out yet Id wanted to but i didnt have the guts to do it. The next day i tell them im agnostic worse reaction. They basically told me i didnt have a choice as to whether or not i went. They told they couldnt and wouldnt force me to be christian yet they make me go to a church full of elderly bigots thrice a week. The only people in my family that know are my parents. Im open about it around my friends but the thought of coming out to my family is mortifying. So ya....thats me,LGBTeens,cmicszz,2,t5_2t8gr

The one piece of advice I would give is to make sure that this doesnt ruin the bond between you have with your brother and your friend. Try to find some way to make it up to them if you can.

2723343,0,t1_cndhtgl,They cant keep him from school forever. Well they can if they dont care about their childs education. But that seems way too harsh. Even if he isnt in school in Monday you could always try as soon as he is in school. Also maybe have his friends relay messages back and forth verbally if possible? That way whatever he needs to say should he feel comfortable saying so can be sent to you through a message that a friend types if he cant be seen with a phone or whatever the case may be.     Maybe if he can use the computer for homework he can set up an email account or some method for communication?      Does he have an iPod or a tablet?  Maybe his parents arent aware of apps like Kik or other messaging apps. If thats the case its possible his parents decided not to confiscate it because it to them doesnt allow for means of communication. ,LGBTeens,cndms5d,1,t5_2t8gr

No abusive or trolling postscomments! These will be removed at the mods discretion. Thats rule number one. I dont know how much you come here but things like sharpies and hairbrushes are suggested a LOT! Like woah mama! Every now and then I try to put out a post where I spill all my knowledge on the topic of sexmasturbation. The problem is these posts dont work for long and before you know it someone is suggesting putting sharpies up your ass again. So not only is it a problem its a chronic problem. It is for this reason that I have decided to remove any and all postscomments that suggest things that are potentially very harmful. That is not to say that I have stopped trying to educate. I have just chosen to use my power as a mod to cut out such terrible information from spreading. As for this...gtIf hes going by experience than maybe you should listen to mod. If not then he really needs to check himself.I hope you dont mean that he should only listen to me if I have personally cut my rectum with a sharpie and got an infection. My goal it to make sure that something like that never happens to anyone. Im not telling you what I think can happen I am telling you what science says could happen. Im not saying you should just never get curious Im just trying my best to make sure that all the kids on this sub are doing it safely.

3421683,0,t3_2zep22,Ill try to go over everything as best as I can Ive been through a lot of similar stuff although in most of those cases to a lesser extent.gt Id have to for the foreseeable future give up any dreams of university or the like. Not necessarily. If your family are having financial troubles you can apply for a student maintenance grant or a special support grant theyre based on your parents income so you could get a part time job ontop of that. It wouldnt be the most luxurious of living arrangements. But hey thats all part of the student life in the end. Just budget properly and you should be solid.gtThe thought of that kills me having to pass up the opportunity to go abroad for a yearI assume you just mean travelling? Yeah that one is a bit more tricky. Any chance of you getting a part time job any time soon or even for a bit over the summer? If you can work a good number of hours over the week during the summer you can save up a lot of money for travel even on a minimum wage As long as youre not having to pay rent or for food or anything presuming youre still with your parents. But heck even if you dont go right now it doesnt mean you cant later. I never ended up being able to do a Year out before Uni but Im planning to travel with a friend after Uni and thats looking to be a much better option for me than before I started Uni anyway.Cant really talk much about the situation with your brother that is kinda unfortunate. gtSpeaking of which my depression has been pretty bad.Depression theres something Im familiar with Yeah it really does suck for damn sure. You could look into talking to your GP about it and your Anxiety issues. Trust me Ive only been getting help with my Anxiety for a few weeks but its helped IMMENSELY. gtWithin an hour just one little comment or a moment of discomfort can set me off into a panic attack. I get really anxious about many things but its mainly social situations.Youre literally a mirror of me at the start of Uni man. These are things youre going to have to tackle over time but dont ever thing you have to suffer through it alone. You can and should see about getting counselling to help you with it even if you dont end up going to your GP about it most Universities will have their own counselling service that can help you with it Which is what Ive been going to in my case. Trust me when I say I wish Id starting going to a counsellor sooner back in my first year rather than leaving it till now. gtI hate being judged even if I know its for my own good for example. When we have a consultation evening at sixthform or even back at school for that matter and the teachers have some constructive criticism for me I literally feel awful for no good reason.Also know exactly where youre coming from there. Had the same issue for a time although Ive kind of gotten hold of it now so it doesnt really bother me any more. It could have a number of causes for you but again counselling can help best with that. In my particular case it was because I hated the thought of anyone laughing at me and criticism in my mind was a roundabout way of being mocked which I absolutely hated more than anything else. Ive stopped seeing it as mockery though I realised that was irrational and just brushed aside those thoughts when they came up. Critique can be very useful especially in academic life or even from peers even if it does sting at times. gt. Last time I went home and spent the following two hours crying curled up in the bathroom under the pretence of having a bath. I dont know why I feel like this but I am.Nothing wrong with that weve all got our own ways of dealing with things better to let the emotions out than in Ive certainly cried a few times over matters. gtIf I walk past a crowd of people and they talk quietly my mind immediately jumps to thoughts of how theyre talking about you theyre saying you look crap or nerdy or ugly and stuff like that.Textbook social anxiety exact same issue that I suffer from. Whenever I hear someone laughing I instantly assumed they were laughing at me. Walking past someone on the street was terrible because I always felt they were judging me. Again Id seriously recommend seeing a counsellor I cannot stress just how much they helped me with these issues. However I can still give you a summary of the advice they gave me. You are you youre a perfectly normal person Im sure that underneath the anxiety you are an absolutely fantastic guy so in the end what does it matter what other people think of you?Most people you fear are judging you are actually barely noticing you. We tend to exaggerate our flaws tenfold in our minds seeing problems with ourselves that others wouldnt even notice. We fret over the idea that someone might notice you have a wonky tooth when you smile when in reality all that person sees is a nice smile. They dont see the slightly off tooth but because of our fears we tend to amplify everything that we possibly see wrong with ourselves. Just take it in your stride whenever you have these thoughts just turn that thought around and tell yourself No one is judging me thats just irrationalBut heyPerhaps that person in the street is judging you or laughing at you?So what their opinion isnt worth anything. Theyre just some person on the street. Youve got friends and family people you choose to be with and their opinion matters more than some nobody youre passing by. So hey even if they are judging you screw them. Youre a better person than they are. Be proud of that.gt My earliest childhood memory was of when I was around four and my best friend turning on me beating the shit out of me and making me so scared. That was awful. My following best friend once my family moved to where we are now and I got along for years. We fell apart at the start of secondary school. He stole stuff from me were talking a few hundred pounds of stuff too not just pens or crap out my bag tried to smother me with a plastic bag and then finally blackmail me with total lies that in hindsight were just total bullshit. Yeah it definitely sucks Youve had a bad time of it the past certainly worse than I had. I had a few people bully me when I was younger so I can empathise to an extent. Its possible its had an effect on you that isnt something I can totally judge. Social anxiety tends to come from a mixture of a few issues and the best way to deal with it is to challenge those issues head on. Putting yourself in social situations that make you uncomfortable are some of the best ways but Id recommend doing it with friends. The first time I ever went to a nightclub was with a group of about  friends. There was absolutely no way I would have done it if I hadnt been with all of them especially the ones who supported me whilst there. One of them even helped me break past another social fear of mine dancing. It was coming to the end of the night and the DJ was playing the last few songs. He basically pulled me along to the dance floor along with the rest of our group and I was meekly resisting along the way but I eventually just gave into it as he was encouraging me and I kinda wanted to push myself. Ended up being one of the best things Ive ever done I was only on the floor for about half an hour or so but I danced about sang along to the songs and generally just had a great time. I wasnt that drunk at the time but you could say I was drunk off the adrenaline. It definitely helped me deal just a little bit more with my anxiety and its these kind of things you need to do to push yourself and help you get over it. ,LGBTeens,cpiap4g,3,t5_2t8gr

The fact that you made this post indicates that he at least peaked your interest in some way.If you dont feel anything towards him if he makes a move you tell him that because being led on sucks. Maybe he was drunk and he forgot the whole thing so this situation wont even occur.

5868975,0,t3_3vmow9,Not entirely sure. I have those friends in school who I am only friends with because I see them almost every day. There are several examples of situations that happened lately that showed me that nobone is as close to me as I thought they were. Worst was when I went to the hospital after I hurt myself in P.E. and NO ONE bothered to ask about it. I thought at least one or two people would care but nope. even told someone that it hurts a lot bc i fell on the same part again two weeks later and she couldnt remember that ive been to the hospital at allApart from that I have like  really great internet friends but I somehow slowly stop talking to them. Actually didnt talk to two of them in weeks. Dont talk to another one as frequently as I used to. Only met the fourth one about . months ago. So not entirely sure whether they count or not.Then there are some people left with whom I sometimes spend my free time with going to concerts playing video games either at someones place or via skype stuff like that. I am not really close to them except for like one of them but thats a whole different storysaid person wasis more or less my best friend not sure about it anymore though. Well I got closer to all of them lately which is actually pretty great but I still dont really know whether to call them friends or not. also they all spend much more time with one another than with me.TLDR wouldnt say I have zero friends but I definitely dont have any good friends. Also I struggle a lot with whether or not to call someone a friend bc I am never sure. actually already lost an actual friend bc of that man felt good to write that tbh,LGBTeens,cxoyc21,1,t5_2t8gr

Other labels dont fit me well such as ones describing political positions. My views can be sporadic being extremely liberal on some issues and very rightwing on others.

6844364,0,t1_d0s0zv3,Another one to add to the list of safe things is solid silicone. Clear silicone is sketchy because of the things they add to it to make it clear but otherwise its on of the safest materials out there. Another bonus to silicone is that it can be boiled for sterilization and cleaned in the dishwasher.As for metal make sure its high quality stainless steel surgical grade is really what youre looking for. Avoid anything else because theres a fair chance its shitty pot metal. Make sure any wood products used are fully sealed. Unsealed wood is porous and traps bacteria. Urinary track infections are not fun and infections anywhere in the digestive system can easily become life threatening.Edit copy pasted from one of my prior comments. Whatever you decide to get make sure it is body safe. If the material is described as jelly cyberskin pvc or anything that contains phthalates are dangerous. They cause skin irritation in many people some ingredients are neurotoxic and many other ingredients have been connected to cancer. The materials you can always rely on to be safe are pure silicone glass sealed wood and steel. If its made of those its safe and if not then do a bit more research into the material.As for which toys to actually get its kinda up to you. My recommendation is to check out Oh Joy Sex Toy . Erica makes unbiased reviews of many toys and often has discounts available for those she likes. My personal interests are The Bootie  The Aneros Massagers  The Fenrir  and The Tenga Flip Hole  Theres plenty of reviews around for everything so just shop around and see what youre comfortable with.If you have anymore questions just ask away.Edit Also Make sure that anything you put in your butt has a non detachable flared base. This prevents it from being sucked inside the anus and becoming stuck. Late night emergency room visits are a pain in the ass in this case quite literally.As for lubes water based is always a safe bet. Silicone is also good but it cant be used with silicone toys. Putting two types of silicone together will degrade both thus ruining the toy. Oil based lubes are safe to use with most toys but I would recommend avoiding non natural ones like vaseline and other petroleum jellies they are a petrochemical and should not be used internally My personal recommendations are pure coconut oil and pure olive oil but beware that these can get absorbed by the body fairly quickly meaning reapplication is a must.,LGBTeens,d0s450i,10,t5_2t8gr

If he is still a minor he should contact Floridas Department of Children and Families to make a reportIf he does opt for utaucxtis suggestion of couch surfing there are many assistance programs for people in his position. For example he could qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP through Floridas Automated Community Connection to Economic Self Sufficiency ACCESS program.If he is forced to go through with this because he cannot reason with his parents then he can take advantage of something called the Education for Homeless Children and Youth Program to allow him to remain in his current school.He must do all of this before he turns eighteen. For example the process can be initiated before his eighteenth birthday to force his parents to keep him in. When he does turn eighteen he is potentially on his own but there are some interesting precedent in some states about financiallydependent young adults. That is why it is so important to begin the process before his eighteenth birthday certain facts will be established by the Department for Children and Families while they still have purview. This might strengthen the case for commonlaw determinations of dependency vs emancipation.                                   ...

7374429,0,t1_d2gcmdm,gt would it be necessary for a virgin?It depends on how you define necessary and virgin. For example gonorrhea can be transferred by mutual masturbation which some people do not consider sex. Someone who calls himself a virgin because the only sexual contact he has ever had is wanking someone once can still be walking around with gonorrhea. Gonorrhea can be asymptomatic too so he could walk around with it for years having no clue he has it infecting others who also think they are in the clear because he is a virgin.gt Also dont you use a condom to prevent from getting HIV and other slimier viruses?Yes but condoms are effective only when both parties are also tested consistently. Back to gonorrhea this gramnegative diplococci is hearty enough to survive on the outsides of condoms for some time. So if you are asymptomatic and wanking yourself then put a condom on you could spread the bacteria all around the outside of the condom without realizing it. Putting all of it together the worst case is that you could spread gonorrhea to the person who takes your virginity even though you have never had sex and are using protection!gt Also if both parties are tested negative would unprotected sex be okay?I think this is definitely the usual view in the mainstream community. If you are in a committed monogamous relationship and you and your partner both test negative then unprotected intercourse is fine in theory. It can be tricky because of something called a window period. But even if you were to follow the testing regimen to the letter a very large proportion of new STIs arise in partners who swear up and down they are abiding their covenants and remaining loyal in their relationships. ,LGBTeens,d2gf6cn,1,t5_2t8gr

7973261,0,t3_4ocjt5,Im  and I had my first relationship this year. We were both closeted which was really the deciding factor in us being together. It only lasted for a month before he ended it which I am actually glad for because the ONLY thing he would talk about with me was sex and was probably the reason he broke up with me I never had sex with him like he wanted. Sure sex in a relationship would be nice but Id only want it to be a small part of the relationship. So Im just going to wait until I could comfortably be out before really entering the dating scene.,LGBTeens,d4c9q52,3,t5_2t8gr

8033225,0,t3_4oujnj,Okay I know this isnt the popular opinion but trust me on this. Im a  year old male bisexual and Ive learned some shit. I went through the same thing as you when I was . All my friends think Im like super straight and I got homecoming king and had the cutest gf for a while and what not so anyways what Im saying is people dont suspect a thing. Heres the two MAIN rules of surviving highschool as a bi male. If you like a girl dont tell her. I was in love with a girl and she said she loved me back but she just couldnt date a bi guy and Im not going to blame her for that because thats understandable. And thats how ALOT of girls feel not all of them but alot. Also I would recommend telling just one of your best guy friends and maybe some girls. The guy can help you hide shit if you mess up and the girls can help u meet guys and then youll have someone to talk to. Anyways if you have any questions message me because I think I can offer some pretty good advice ,LGBTeens,d4j0dum,1,t5_2t8gr

8141675,0,t3_4qr015,So I am not the best at issues like this but I will try to help...First off it takes time to know whether or not you are transgender so be patient. Yes it is true that the earlier you start hormonal therapy the better however do not jump to conclusions. This is a very difficult time for many people so try to take it one step at a time. Try to imagine yourself in the future do you see yourself as a man or woman? I am not saying that if you see yourself as a woman that you are transgender but it might be a possible sign. Try asking people on rasktransgender on how they knew they were transgender and how you might go about confirming your belief.In terms of your sexuality it depends on your gender identity. If you identify as a girl then you are heterosexual. If you identify as a boy then you are homosexual. Both of these are based off of what you told meAlso ask yourself what you like about being a guy. Is it anatomical or is it stereotypical gender roles? You could also be a demigirl or a demiboy not one or the other but you lean towards one of the binary genders. There is also a spectrum of infinite genders so you could land anywhere on that line.I truly hope that this helps and I hope that you are able to properly figure out who you are down the road! If you ever need to talk about this or ANYTHING just shoot me a PM and I will be happy to help. Stay gold,LGBTeens,d4v96fr,9,t5_2t8gr

8182012,1,t1_d508srs,gtTrump has said numerous times that he opposes same sex You sure?The only reason why he was against the  legalization of same sex marriage is that he is a traditionalist he believed that states should be able to decide. Regardless he was more pissed off at Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts Once again the Bushappointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Other than that trump has been very vocal for same sex marriage and LGBT rights.In  Trump gave a interview to The Advocate an LGBTQ magazine. He talks about how diversity is good for a business bottom line. In all truth he said I dont care whether or not a person is gay. I judge people based on their capability honesty and merit. When asked if he would appoint LGBTQ individuals in his administration Trump replied I want the best and the brightest... if the best person for the job happens to be gay I would certainly appoint them.In  Trump attended the civilpartnership ceremony between singer Elton John and his longtime boyfriend David Furnish. He later wrote on his blog Im very happy for them. If two people dig each other they dig each other. He then concluded This is a marriage that is going to work. Trump has also publicly denounced North Carolinas controversial bathroom law. Trump stated that individuals should be able to use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.,LGBTeens,d50av2r,0,t5_2t8gr
8182893,0,t3_4rdbfk,Rejection.Ive almost accepted the fact I may lose some of my family if I come out if not all of my family. Funny thing is its not related to my bisexuality. Its related to my gender identity.I know Im not  a guy. If I had to pick a label to describe it as best I can it would be genderfluid even though I hate calling myself that because fucking Tumblr has turned nonbinary gender identities into a big joke with the whole I am a trigender pyrofox shit.Hell I may even be binary trans and afraid to accept it idfk.But no matter which turns out to be true my family has basically shown through their actions that they are not very chill when it comes to gender identity. In their eyes they only see bio male or bio female. Anything else is an ungodly abomination or symbolism of the moral decay of the world.Thats the funny thing about it. I always feared the day I came out to my family about my sexuality. But they couldnt care less about what a family member happens to prefer to sleep with. Theyre more worried about Men being men and women being women.Sorry for the long rant Ive kept that in for a while.,LGBTeens,d50eu0f,2,t5_2t8gr

8195311,0,t1_d51yf3d,I would create a noncombat branch of the military combining the army corp of engineers and the other engineering divisions with the private sector. They would help repair infrastructure in foreign countries like roads bridges and power plants. For training and experience they would work on the domestic infrastructure that is seriously impaired. This would also provide unemployed or lowincome families with a low skill job that would pay well above the poverty line and with veterans benefits take money out of Social Security to pay. I know it seems impractical but it would seriously help the jobs market construction industry and our allies abroad.That and guarantee basic human rights to all persons be it LGBT or not. Oh and repeal the religious liberties bill. It is not that I am antireligion but it gives people a reason to discriminate. ,LGBTeens,d51ys8z,1,t5_2t8gr

8467694,0,t3_4us0fc,It depends. I once was close friends with a guy who went to bording school in High School sophomore year. I stayed over with him quite a few nights since he had no roommate. It could just be because  we have been really close friends since we were literally babies but the moment we would walk into the dorm and close the door he pulled off his shirt and threw his pants across the room. I never did myself bc Im too self conscious with my body but he generally was really comfortable being in nothing but his underwear around me he was also extremely sexy.Now we did stop being friends and are now very distant but I do hear that he takes showers with his close friends if they have too and is naked most of the time with his new roommate they are now Seniors in highschool this year. So it really depends on the guy. My current best friend is very confident and is in nothing but his underwear a lot when its just us but I never am in anything less than shorts and a tshirt due to low self esteem. So it depends.PS it may be false but I read somewhere that you can ask your school to room you with another gaybi guy as long as there are other gaybi guys who have marked their orientation on registrations.

9667349,0,t3_5dgi63,Liking whoever you like is your right. What youre describing is bisexuality which is liking either gender. Its the B in LGBT. Its not denial. Its not weird. More of my friends are bi than gay.In terms of your family you be the judge of whether you should come out. I dont know how they would take it. Do what you think is right there is no obligation for you to reveal it to them if youre worried that it could cause serious damage. A thing to consider is that they could find out even if you try to hide it. rLGBTeens on your internet history could bring their wrath if they think you hid your homosexuality from them. There are ways of finding your familys opinion on LGBT matters without asking a direct question. For example you could watch Modern Family and get their opinions on Cam and Mitchell a gay couple on the show. Im sure you could figure out a way.Coming out has big benefits mainly other gay people knowing youre gay. And you can check out other guys with anyone else who fancies guys or girls with anyone who fancies them. You can connect more with people. I recommend coming out to people again though only you can judge if it will do more harm than good.I hope that helps.,LGBTeens,da4pbso,7,t5_2t8gr

I think it is largely due to the implied cant be friends with opposite sex that some of society pushes. And because of that Im uncomfortable because then they may tease me in the sense of hehe gay guy Im so pretty Ill make him straight  and that would be awkward because Im sexually attracted and allowing them to think I am not seems exploitive. one of several reasons.        What do you find makes it feel awkward?    Did it seem like you were flirting or were you?     I hear you a label is nice it gives you a group to be part of. I try not to care about them but I do.

10162939,0,t3_5lcx6e,All in all I had a good year one of my worst but also the best. One of my best friends stopped talking to me which took me months to get over and made me feel terrible a lot like I got behind in school work as a result of it. Then over summer I literally did nothing and only talked to one friend over the whole holidays overw which I felt like crying every night and did cry plenty nights. That friend I talked to over summer was actually someone I had drifted apart from in Feb  but we began taking again literally just at the end of beginning of  so  bought her back and it was the best thing ever.Other highlights include making more friends and the last two term holidays halloween and christmas being so so enjoyable and not me alone the whole time. Loneliness is one of the things which made me feel so bad over summer I can confidently say I am no longer lonely at all. I became vegetarian this year Id wanted to do it for a while then at some point it came up in convo with my mum who liked the idea. My mum brother and I all went vegetarian and Im so so proud of it and I feel like Im doing what is right. I want to once Im more independent take up veganism Im looking forward to that in  maybe when I start uni Ill do it.I got a offer back for one of my top two choices an university Im still waiting on others but Im in awe that I actually got an offer I was really uncertain whether I would or not. It also makes me feel a lot better about losing a grade or two last year in some subject because of how I wasnt well.Lastly Ive finally built what I consider to be a decent wardrobe from shit all in the last year Ive never been confident enough to dress nicely like I shouldnt be allowed to cuz Im just plain old me I guess this sort of makes sense at to why Ive always given myself little self worth and think Im not cool enough too dress up. Somehow Ive managed to overcome that greatly the last year I still feel anxious wearing things the first few times before Im confident in it but I am much better than I was. Ive went from having no fashion sense last september to being obsessed with it not just how Im dressed but fashion in general I love it. It may seem not that big but dressing how I like is a huge deal for me and my low selfesteem.I think Im done nobody will probably read this but it was good to write this I have just realised what I have achieved this year through writing this.

10414410,0,t3_5p446a,I understand why his sudden unexplained change in behaviour is worrying and hurtful to you but sometime you need to give people a bit of space.This is either transient or foreshadowing. If its transient which is likely there isnt much you can do more than to tell him youre there for him if he wants to talk then to give him some space. Sometimes people just need some alone time even from the people they love and sometimes they dont feel comfortable even saying that they need some alone time eg as to not hurt others. Alternatively he might be shutting people out for some reason which is why its important to let him know youre there if he needs you.The foreshadowing option while less likely should be kept in mind. Not as to panic about rather as to acknowledge as always a possibility. It could be that he reduced contact with you because hes less interested. Thats not to say that him talking to you less for a short while is a sure sign of an impending doom but just to say that circumstances change and people react to them changing differently.I hope you can work through it and that itll pass over soon ,LGBTeens,dcojhuk,2,t5_2t8gr

11561999,0,t3_650obd,I was supposed to change my age to  last Thursday but I am always on my phone on reddit. So yeah  is a bit too little. With a girl? Done it all. With a guy? Nothing until very recently. I thought it would all change  after moving for university. It did a bit.What changed? I did. Im more open about myself when I know almost nobody than I was around people I knew for a long time. And when you are more open you are free to do pretty much whatever you want. So my point is excuse my drunk self go to college and create a picture of yourself that you want. People will respect you more if they see you are comfortable with yourself whoever that might be. And also its easier to find someone when you know what you are looking for AND when theres nobody looking at you and focusing on what you are looking for.Hope my comment helps you. ,LGBTeens,dg6k2js,8,t5_2t8gr

11704088,0,t3_66wvif,Pardon me if Im wrong on some of this I am not intersex myself but I have a few intersex friends who have educated me on this ideaBeing intersex is not an identity but rather a broad term for many different conditions. The only way to know whether or not you are intersex is to see a medical professional who will run chromosomal and other hormonal tests. No one here can tell you if you are intersex. Although the term intersex gets lumped with the LGBT community a lot a lot of intersex people dont want to be lumped with this community as being intersex in the majority of cases is a condition that involves XXY chromosomes. Many people dont ever even know if they are intersex because people dont usually tend to get their chromosomes checked at any point in life!Talk to your doctor. They can give you a firm answer.,LGBTeens,dgmoe80,1,t5_2t8gr
