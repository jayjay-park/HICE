Cant see where goals are going to come from at the moment hopefully Jones coming back will be a boost but were going to need more than that. Why was Doyle not given a chance this season? I thought he showed promise at the back end of last year.I see a lot of people are starting to call for Slades head again tonight. What are your thoughts on him now?,bluebirds,cwnhwb2,1,t5_2wzy0

It would be a shame though to see Peltier dropped as I feel hes always been solid and consistent for us even if hes not the greatest going forward plus with  centrebacks it helps if the ones on the outside of the  are comfortable when theyre being pulled into wider areas which Peltier would be fine with as hes spent so much time at rightback.As for the midfield  thats a tricky one. The only one Im  certain will be involved is Ralls and deservedly so imo hes come on in leaps and bounds since breaking into the team. Id probably like to see OKeefe and Whittingham with him with Whitts being the most advanced of the  in order to try and relieve him from some defensive responsibility.I dont see where Noone fits in all of this unless we plan on using different systems at various times. I wonder if wed consider selling him if somebody came in for him.To be honest Im looking forward to seeing how it all pans out hopefully we can clear out some more deadwood soon to allow us to bring in a couple more players preferably ones with Championship experience if possible.,bluebirds,d5iul6h,1,t5_2wzy0
