14879,0,t3_1uajko,I recently pulled my clarinet out of storage only to find the pads in horrible condition. I called around and it was looking like it would cost a few hundred bucks to get new pads. Its a pretty nice clarinet so replacing it wasnt in my budget but neither was a few hundred bucks to get new pads. I went to the music shop bought a full set of pads for  bucks and went on YouTube for some instruction. It now sounds as good as it did when I first got it. I admit the process was a bit tricky considering I had never taken it apart before and my tools werent quite as fancy  I used a candle instead of a torch and a good ole hot glue gun. It is nice however to know that I wont ever have to pay someone to do this anymore.Forgive me if I am not posting this link correctly as I am on my mobile but here is my favorite tutorial on YouTube ,Clarinet,ceg4mka,4,t5_2sc5o

807554,0,t3_2349s4,I started about a month and a half ago with tons of experience in other instrument families but no woodwinds.. Getting time to practice is definitely a thing but I can almost always find at least  minutes a day and that at least keeps me moving forward.  Fortunately I dont have to worry about neighbors even though Im in an apartmentIm in a corner unit and the only neighbor that could hear me is a nice older couple that doesnt hear well and likes the music anyway.. Im finding tone production to be wildly inconsistent.  Some days I sound great others Im extremely stuffy.  Im sure most of it is me but I suspect some of it is the way the reed is placed and the placementtightness of the ligature.  The break is pretty ugly too.  Fingerings arent bad I just dont have the muscle memory to read quickly yet.. The dream is to just play everything.  I already had piano the entire brass family and a smattering of others guitarbass and related instruments some harp so this felt like the next step.. Im mainly a musical theater guy now but I come from a classical piano background so that always feels like home to me.. Not really much of a jazz player.  I can do section stuff but dont ask me to improvise.. Im at a point where I think I just need to play a lot so Ive been reading through everything I can find.  Trumpet etudes turn out to be excellent exercises for working on the break as trumpet music very unabashedly crosses that line like crazy and things like the BbC trill are trivial on trumpet.. I try to get in long tone work every day.  My teacher turned me on to overtone exercises e.g. playing upper register notes without pressing the register key which have been really helpful in getting a steady sound with good tone quality.  Then its scales for basic technique and then doing sight reading to help build that immediate connection between the dots on the page and the fingerings that make them happen.. I took weekly lessons to get started then I switched them over to sax lessons.  As I said above I think I just need to play a bunch of stuff now.  The teacher was fantastic for diagnosing things I never would have figured out on my own such as inadvertently opening up a tone hole a hair while reaching for pinky keys.  Now I feel at least somewhat competent at diagnosing my own problems.. Just IMSLP to find stuff to read.  I dont think online lessons work at all.. This is mainly just for fun with the secondary goal of becoming even more versatile for theater gigs.,Clarinet,cgw2n7l,1,t5_2sc5o
1086434,0,t3_26jcnk,I used to play this way. The tone it far better but you lack control especially in the upper ranges of the instrument. It just flat out hurts when you have to apply pressure for the third octave for example.Do whatever feels right for you.,Clarinet,chrs399,2,t5_2sc5o

3361879,0,t3_2ylnao,Go for it.  At worst it will be the same level of difficulty as switching to clarinet but in my opinion bass is actually more similar to saxophone especially if you have tenor experience.  As others have said only real difference is the embouchure.And even if it was totally different you should do it anyways!  Youre in high school thats the best time you could pick up a new instrument and bass clarinet is hands down the most fun thing there is to play!,Clarinet,cpbh9h4,1,t5_2sc5o

4984537,0,t3_3fvgyc,I use a lot of overtone exercises to improve my range I dont know how high you are trying to improve but for basic altissimo over Bb I learn how to play those notes without using the register keysame fingering just no register key and try to do long tones while slurring between changes for example  beats of Bb then play C  beats more then C then D total of  rest and keep going up if I fail I go down half a step and go all the way down then try the note I failed I do this both with register key and without. Try to open your throat as much as possible and do it as quiet as you possibly can.edit do not forget your tuner and check with it while you do this without the register key it is completely ok if the notes are slightly flat but when you use the register key they should be perfect if you are flat when doing notes above C use the right hand Eb pinky key to raise them up a bit. Other high notes do have fingerings that help with tuning.,Clarinet,cumtkql,1,t5_2sc5o
5053444,0,t3_3jxei8,it feels awkward but I highly recommend learning the standard tonguing technique. Personal experience I also was off with my articulation and once I learned how to tongue properly all those passages that had tonguing that seemed ridiculous and impossible for me became doable it also works way better for tonguing altissimo notes... try to tongue an upper altissimo Gsame fingering as clarion F but no left index finger or same as altissimo D in concert pitch or something around there I can almost guarantee you wont be able to articulate it if you anchor.TLDR I know of no real advantages of anchor tonguing over standard tonguing the opposite I could name a ton.,Clarinet,cuv4r0l,1,t5_2sc5o

8570098,0,t3_4x5xw6,The main suggestions I give to players are to lower the jaw as much as possible and try adjusting how far you have the mouthpiece in your mouth generally putting more of the mouthpiece in your mouth helps in my experience. Also just use more air maybe at the beginning of the note? It could be possible finger placement might be a problem because you have the holes instead of the mostly keys on an oboe. Hope this helps! ,Clarinet,d6cudts,1,t5_2sc5o

9886661,0,t3_5gvwii,It depends on what kind of sound youre looking for.For the typical American sound think Bonade Marcellus Wright the default recommendation is the Bonade ligature.  However the build quality and quality control on those ligatures are pretty poor.  The Rovner Versa Vandoren Optimum Ishimori and  Spriggs all work on the same principles and have much better build quality and QC.  I personally use an Ishimori copper but if youre a material matters person they have solid silver as well as several other options.If youre on a budget and are OK with less ring then the standard Rovner or a Luyben are both good choices.,Clarinet,daw96uk,1,t5_2sc5o

11424097,0,t3_62z4v7,At one point there was a sort of macho attitude of playing everything on a Bb clarinet for which one needed an Eb key.  The idea is that for really good players the fingering complexities in keys with lots of sharps and flats shouldnt be a problem so they dont need an A.  This seems to have been a popular idea in Italy especially although some players still see no problem in playing the entire third movement of Contrasts on one instrument.  The pendulum has swung back somewhat in that lots of players now have C clarinets which wasnt the case so much  years ago.  Clearly its not something you get around especially if you reject the alternatives for the reasons mentioned above.  Check used instrument sources in Italy.,Clarinet,dfqwrmu,1,t5_2sc5o
