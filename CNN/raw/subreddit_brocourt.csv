672226,0,t1_cggijjh,Bros before Hoes means that you should not place sexual desire for a random girl over the wellbeing of your bros. It COULD be reworded as Bros before S.O.s but this is IMO much more sexist and actually defeats the initial intention. Your S.O. is in a sense your bro. Just as clearly not every guy is your bro not every girl is a ladybroshebro Hoes is the admittedly unfortunate term that refers to girls to whom you owe nothing under the bro code.,brocourt,cggojnf,1,t5_2xto5

1708257,0,t3_2dxre9,Its okay to apologize about the situation. It sounds like your bro fundamentally got that you were bitten and that thats a big deal and you needed to defend yourself. But dont get walked all over if he escalates. However it sounds like hes probably just upset and hurting over the whole experience probably just as much angry about you being bitten as about you hitting the dog but one cant do much by ranting to the dog about how they shouldnt have bitten a bro you know? ... give him some time and let him know you get that its an unfortunate experience for everyone involved but youre not holding it against him or the dog and you hope he can get okay with the same.,brocourt,cjuhk70,4,t5_2xto5

8570151,0,t3_4x5mms,I didnt even know I was subbed here still. He didnt cockblock you. One. If you didnt go with them because you were worried about them being intoxicated you didnt really specify so I took the most logical option then that is not being there for a bro and on you. If this isnt the case thenTwo. It sounds like they went out and had a lot of fun. I know an escapade like that if you completely forgot what you even left for but still come back happy I bet something happened. My point being why didnt you go with them assuming they werent driving drunk which is what it sounds like anyway? It just sounds like you werent even that interested. They were still hanging out. They were still having fun. And you told them you were done with fun. So why would she come back with them? The guy she was into I dont know them maybe they talked you up as an incentive for you to hang out has tapped out for the night content to sit at home and wait for his food. Three. And Ive noticed this kind of pattern among those that frequented here since it was formed and the shiny new sub crowd left. Your bro does not owe you a woman. If he wants to return the favor he can help you but you still have to put in the effort. You know like relationships require. He did not whisk her away you said leave without me. And finally.... Four. Or Three and a half rather. So you know shes in town. And you want her to know you are actually interested. So youre sitting on your ass on the sidelines and waiting for someone to move you for you. Tell. Your. Friend. Say Hey so girl is back in town? you guys want to hang out? Your friend isnt psychic. You shot down a chance to hang out with this girl before. Wont she just be more disappointed if you bail again? tldr Stop bitching about people not catering to your every wish particularly if you dont tell anyone what those wishes are and get off your ass if you want her so bad.,brocourt,d6cumfk,15,t5_2xto5
