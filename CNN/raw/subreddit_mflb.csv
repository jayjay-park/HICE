42435,0,t3_1ukig6,Its certainly a luxury item at the  price point but man I agree with you fully.  After the Power Adapter I rank the FG as the nd best accessory you can add to your kit.  Its really friggin hard to explain just how much it helps but it is so worth it.There are of course many ways to achieve the powderlike consistency that works best with the MFLB and pinching the herb between your fingers after a hit or two works just fine.   That said its really nice to be able to achieve that fine grind consistency from the beginning with the FG.  What I do is place the Finishing Grinder on top of an open film canister while grinding.  It fits fairly well and it allows me to fill the canister with nothing but the finestground shavings ready to be loaded into the Box at any moment.,mflb,cej9gag,2,t5_2rs76

344357,0,t1_cfgfmtn,Reggie is a term in the u.s. atleast from my neck of the woods. There are two completely different kinds of weed on the market. One is how medical is grown. Individual plants are in pots and delicately cared for to produce amazing bud from the best weed strains available.  The other is growing out doors from the ground. You get an ass ton of seeds you plant the seeds add water and tadaa you got a cash crop. Its just a plant it grows like a weed. And it will produce legitmate marijuana that has a moderate thc content.  Depending if its cared for and climate soil conditions obviously would impact the buds dankness. Hydroponicly grown plants in perfect conditions obviously tend to be way superior to these regular grown buds.,mflb,cfggmtc,3,t5_2rs76

728242,0,t3_22g6df,You probably wont like the MFLB. You are asking too much of it.Firstly. You will get a different high. ESPECIALLY if you are smoking with tobacco. Youre going to be quite disappointed by a vape high because you are experiencing the THC on its own. No dizzyness headrush stoned feeling. It can take up to half an hour to properly hit you. Not at all like a spliff.Also its crap for sharing. Im gonna be honest here. Lending out the MFLB to spliff smokers on a normal rotation is a great way to ruin your box as uninitiated smoker after uninitiated smoker combusts and cherries in your box and reduces the screen to black. not to mention everyone saying it doesnt work. It has a steep learning curve. Getting it wrong can cosmetically damage your unit.So it sounds like youd be better off with a table vape if you want to try vaping or a pax. Both of these options will be easier to pass around in a group but you will still notice a real difference in the high they offer you.EDIT Disclaimer Didnt mean to be negative. I own and love my MFLB I use it every day and it has completely replaced smoking for me. Its awesome.However looking at your list of criteria in your original post. It just doesnt seem like the right device for you.,mflb,cgn1z88,9,t5_2rs76

That being said with certain cares and techniques you can be as discrete as it gets with the mflb these include taking smaller and faster hits as opposed to longer and hotter hits maintaning a clean box by cleaning it periodically with ISO Alcohol pregrinding your material so that you dont have to handle it on the vaping spot etc. I have had my box for  months vaping weekly in my room with closed doors where I sleep right next to my brothers room who is yet to suspect anything and he would recognize the smell. ,mflb,cgwrm7c,3,t5_2rs76

Id say its different if you were to take a picture of the MFLB while you were hiking and took a picture of the amazing view or something along those lines. It gives the other people here something to actually talk about. Regarding uISubmitThis I think he gets too much hate for what he does on here. Yes he does cp some responses but those are to Commonly Asked Questions. I do agree he seems to delete a lot of stuff that might seem unnecessary so I cant really talk too much about thatAs for questionsconcerns on this subreddit I think rmflb should be majority of these posts. Personally I love to help people out and especially with a product I love and use almost daily.

Magic Flight maintains that Glyph batteries are  as powerful as the power adapter which is a big improvement from old stock  Imedions.They also last more trenches than the old  Imedions.           Even if you DID want to use nonglyph batteries in your MFLB why would anyone buy those energizer batteries when a four pack of old stock batteries recommended by MFLB are only a few dollars more?          Ive tried  packs of Energizer s bought at the same time and both had issues within a few months. Perhaps Energizer has worked out whatever issues they had but my old Maha batteries have ALWAYS been reliable and the new glyphs are amazing. Paying a few more dollars for peace of mind is worth it to me.        EDIT Seems like Energizer fixed the problems with the s perhaps I bought some of the old ones?

1766035,0,t3_2epdd7,Yes you should feel hot air on your tongue as you sip. Use the tongue to gauge the temp and stop the battery if the temp goes too high. If you cannot feel the hot air on your tongue stop drawing for one or two seconds and then take another sip. It should be noticeably hotter as the box has heated up in the second that you stopped inhaling.Counter intuitively less hits means a hotter box. Because each hit cools the box with cold air. Sucking hard on the box will actually not be a good hit at all because too much air has cooled the box below vaping thresholds. ,mflb,ck1rjk2,1,t5_2rs76

2179562,0,t3_2jyud0,With all due respect my father has hepatitis C and he used some Kava Kava from Gaia Herbs three capsules as directed and he developed jaundice within an hours time and ended up in the ICU. Granted his liver is  compromised from stage two fatty liver. If clinical trials and experiments show that it can be extremely hard for the liver to digest and raises the production of bilirubin and albumin to abnormal levels and then it has a severe sudden reaction on a person with Hep C that I witnessed in person I would have to be stupid as an individual to not logically conclude that its harsh on the hepatic system. I dont think its really an issue up for debate  research it. My question is whether or not the kavalactones that are being vaporized into the pulmonary system are poisonous in and of themselves as well as wondering how theyre digested through the body when taken in through the pulmonary system. I noticed that when I did enough to get really really high I had to urinate about fifteen minutes later. To me that seems like it must have started to pass out really quickly. Thats extremely quickly though  so is that alright for the renal system? And again what about the liver? It has to come out of you from somewhere no matter where you take it in from. BUT it may be significantly less consequential or it may not matter at all  perhaps the kavalactones by themselves are benign? Also what about the lungs? Does anyone know if it leaves any sort of resin or sticky residue in the lungs that could injure the alveoli? Im just interested in this because I really like to use Kava but I have a compromising situation so Id like to know exactly how the method of intake enters exits and what traces it leaves behind. And no I dont mean I have hepatitis but Id rather not disclose my issue publicly. ,mflb,clgvipg,1,t5_2rs76

2211618,0,t3_2kfy0q,Yes! The Launch Box will be super powerful brand new. Your technique until it breaks in should be to start drawing before inserting the battery. Look at it while drawing with the battery out to see if its making a tornado  slow down if it is. If you cant slow it down enough try taking in air from the sides of your mouth while drawing instead of making a full seal. You should draw as quickly as possible without making the herb swirl around which will ultimately be very slow.As the Box and your batteries wear youll notice them becoming weaker  they are stabilizing and this is when you apply your permanent technique of waiting  seconds before drawing then starting slowly until it feels hot then going to the maximum rate as described above. Hopefully these initial techniques will help you prevent burning and combustion as you start off.,mflb,clky7p8,3,t5_2rs76

2895086,0,t3_2taco1,The article Ecigarette liquids are typically solutions of propylene glycol glycerol or both plus nicotine and flavorant chemicals. We have observed that formaldehydecontaining hemiacetals shown by others to be entities that are detectable by means of nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy can be formed during the ecigarette vaping process. Formaldehyde is a known degradation product of propylene glycol that reacts with propylene glycol and glycerol during vaporization to produce hemiacetals Figure FIGURE Daily Exposures to Formaldehyde Associated with Cigarettes and ECigarettes.. These molecules are known formaldehydereleasing agents that are used as industrial biocides. In many samples of the particulate matter i.e. the aerosol in vaped ecigarettes more than  of the total solvent molecules have converted to formaldehydereleasing agents reaching concentrations higher than concentrations of nicotine. This happens when propylene glycol and glycerol are heated in the presence of oxygen to temperatures reached by commercially available ecigarettes operating at high voltage. How formaldehydereleasing agents behave in the respiratory tract is unknown but formaldehyde is an International Agency for Research on Cancer group  carcinogen.Here we present results of an analysis of commercial eliquid vaporized with the use of a tank system ecigarette featuring a variablevoltage battery. The aerosolized liquid was collected in an NMR spectroscopy tube  ml puffs over  minutes  to  seconds per puff. With each puff  to  mg of eliquid was consumed and  to  mg of liquid was collected. At low voltage . V we did not detect the formation of any formaldehydereleasing agents estimated limit of detection approximately . g per  puffs. At high voltage . V a mean SE of  g per sample  puffs of formaldehyde was detected as formaldehydereleasing agents. Extrapolating from the results at high voltage an ecigarette user vaping at a rate of  ml per day would inhale .. mg of formaldehyde per day in formaldehydereleasing agents. This estimate is conservative because we did not collect all of the aerosolized liquid nor did we collect any gasphase formaldehyde. One estimate of the average delivery of formaldehyde from conventional cigarettes is approximately  g per cigarette or  mg per pack of  cigarettes. Daily exposures of formaldehyde associated with cigarettes ecigarettes from the formaldehyde gas phase and ecigarettes from aerosol particles containing formaldehydereleasing agents are shown in Figure .Inhaled formaldehyde has a reported slope factor of . kg of body weight per milligram of formaldehyde per day for cancer  Among persons with a body weight of  kg the incremental lifetime cancer risk associated with longterm cigarette smoking at  pack per day may then be estimated at . If we assume that inhaling formaldehydereleasing agents carries the same risk per unit of formaldehyde as the risk associated with inhaling gaseous formaldehyde then longterm vaping is associated with an incremental lifetime cancer risk of .. This risk is  times as high as compared with the risk based on the calculation of Miyake and Shibamoto shown in Figure  or even  times as high as compared with the risk based on the calculation of Counts et al. shown in Figure  as the risk associated with longterm smoking. In addition formaldehydereleasing agents may deposit more efficiently in the respiratory tract than gaseous formaldehyde and so they could carry a higher slope factor for cancer.

5119103,0,t3_3l34cg,Quick lesson on batteries!So there are a few different things you need to learn about batteries.  I find it the best way to explain them is like water in a bucket.  So the bucket holds a set amount of water.  That is exactly like the mAh which is just how many milliamp hours.  . amps in an hour and then the battery will be completely drained.  Since this is a NiMH battery you can fully drain it without worrying about damage to the cell.  Then you have voltage.  Most batteries will not hold over . volts when fully charge.  The voltage is the rate that electrons flow through the circuit.  In our bucket example lets pretend that the bucket has an adjustable hole in which water flows.  You can make it bigger higher voltage or smaller lower voltage.  The last part would explain the resistance of the circuit.  I dont know off the top of my head what the resistance of the MFLB is but someone did that using a multimeter a while ago.  Doing some quick googling found that the MFLB draws in about  Amps while its being powered. For comparison a samsung galaxy charger does about . amps.Ive realized this is way more information than you really need but once I got started I didnt want to stop.,mflb,cv31l5j,4,t5_2rs76

5699139,0,t1_cx3453j,Get a small mason jar with a sealer type lid  a coffee filter a small bottle of isopropyl  alcohol a pyrex dish square is easiest and a razor blade. Put the coffee filter inside the jar  with the edges hanging out so the lid can screw over and hold it in place so that you can strain liquid into the jar. Combine your kief and the alcohol however you please i usually just dump kief into the dry filter and pour the alcohol over it a little bit at a time. Wait for it to strain through  and squeeze out the excess alcohol carefully. This part is dangerous  but you should only have a fairly small amount of alcohol to cook off so open the window  turn on a fan anything to get the air moving.  Turn your stove on nice and low  or  and be ready to stand there until your done this step.  No wandering off to take a piss! This is very flamable business no sparks no smoking  no nothing. A ceramic flat top stove is the safest best  but i have used old coil burners many many times. PSADO NOT DO THIS WITH A NATURAL GAS STOVE. Put the alcohol mixture into your pryex dish  and put it on the stove. Blow across it every few seconds  dont let it boil and lightly keep rocking it so you dont get a dry spot. Remove it from the heat when its still runny.  The warm pan will do the rest in a few minutes. Scrape it up with a razor blade  and put it into a container of your choosing.  The end product will be very hard so scrape it while it is warm  and you will need to warm it with a lighter to scoop it. If you dont like that soak some abv in iso for  mins and add that to the mix.  It makes it darker  but also more manageable. You can also  just used the abv  and it makes a pretty reasonable dark oil by itself.  I think its a better return than smoking bad tasting dried up joints.  ltShrugsgt  ,mflb,cx3j7gi,2,t5_2rs76

I love both for their simplistic concept less stuff that can break and theyre so simple that you could build your own with basic engineering knowledge.The DBVs handling is hassle free  basically you put herb in the chamber and itll work as intended which is great if you hand it to someone inexperienced. You dont have to clean the DBV after every use just dump out the herb and you are fine. In general its less hassle and a more relaxed experience especially when you got company.If you consider to upgrade only for yourself and youve already acquired the technique to handle the MFLB  you might just wanna get the power adapter. Its quite expensive for what it is but it is a small batch special interest device and building your own is probably more expensive if you consider the time spent and the lifetime warranty.,mflb,cxgraoa,5,t5_2rs76

5824442,0,t3_3uxd6g,Id recommend you to assemble the Bottle Rocket like shown on the instructions that are included. Its really not that hard. Only thing to take care of is that the whip that is attached on the top touches the wood. In other words push the stem down till the whip seals with the wood. If there is not enough space in the bottle use the shorter stem for inside or push the outer stem further into the whip.As bottle I recommend using a  liter Coca Cola bottle. It fits perfectly for the long stem has a nice grip and it is clear so you can see the vapor.For usage I use this technique engange power on MFLB I use the PA with about      power. Wait about five seconds then start slowly drawing on the stem of the bottle rocket. It really takes some practise to do a slow pulling on the bottle rocket. Most first time users draw too fast. The nice thing of the Bottle Rocket is that it cools down the vapor so you can inhale for a longer time. If you do so dont forget to shake your trench even in middraw. If you draw for about  seconds or longer without shaking the herb might combust.,mflb,cxj3y9s,1,t5_2rs76

5893063,0,t3_3vym1j,I like the harshness of a good hit. When I first got my mflb I was happy with it but I could only get maybe the first or second hit to be denser using batteries. After that they just fade out. I considered the mflb power adapter but I didnt like the range of voltage output and I thought I could make one cheaper for than the price they were listed at. I ended up spending more but thats okay it was a good experience. On the bright side Im the only one who has one like mine.   The mflb battery outputs . volts at amps.  My PApower adapter has a range of .v  .v at amps.  At .v those hits are hard and it heats up significantly faster than at .v. I really like it. But it being so hot I always use a silicone whip connected to my stem. I lathed a chunk of some maple into a mouth piece that I can connect to the end of the whip.  I also have a rubber adaptor that I can connect to the whip that allows me to attach the mflb to my bong.  That combined with the PA on max will make some clouds.   Excessive a tad.

OP just hooked an  to the  top  You cant vape it in temp mode because you dont know the TCR value of the material. And that is if it uses a material that changes resistance when heated. So unfortunately no temp mode of his mod and then to the mflb. Traditionally imo the reg batteries on an mflb drop very quickly. OPs prototype allows the wattage imput to the internal mflb contact to remain constant at a preset wattage.

Roll your tongue up and push it towards the front of your mouth so it blocks the hot vapor from going directly to your throat.Other things include drinking cool water immediately before and after hits and of course practicing temperature control with the box. I would also recommend being conscious of and experimenting with the way youre breathing in since the tightening of the chest probably has more to do with that than anything else.,mflb,d8wvkjh,1,t5_2rs76

11021145,0,t3_5xd0o3,Do you see a light when you look down the draw hole amp press in the battery? If so start breathing in when you see vapor form. Use your tongue as a temperature gauge I like somewhere between warm and hot. You should be able to taste the vapor depends on your hit whether any is visible. Some of mine have vapor others dont. A finer grind will produce more vapor but also hits the point of combustion quicker so be careful if you go that route. You can also try not inhaling that is into your lungs and pulling your draw with your tonguevery light inhale. This way the vapor stays in your mouth and upon exhale it should be more visible. DO TAKE CARE to take a relatively small hit doing this as it is very very very easy to combust so be aware of that. If nothing else try somewhere where you can see your breath. Then when you take a hit see if theres a bigger cloud upon exhale than just your breath. Good luck!,mflb,deh7sxl,2,t5_2rs76
