8985175,0,t1_d7rvbkf,The male cast can be hard since theyre all in tuxedos. If you go to the ballroom for the very first scene at the start of the show you can usually tell who is who by the women they are dancing with.For instance Banquo will dance with Bald Witch. Shes usually wearing a wig at this point but her dress is a burgundy. Malcolm will dance with Boy Witch. Im sure you can figure out who Boy Witch is. Malcolm also wears a crest on his jacket.MacDuff will dance with Sexy Witch. Sexy Witch is in a blueish green dress and well..  shes pretty sexy. Duncan dances with Lady Macbeth. Shes in a black sequins dress. Duncan is usually played by an older actor but not always.If you look up at the mezzanine you will find Macbeth watching over the show. The rest of the male characters are pretty easy to figure out.,sleepnomore,d7rvoz7,1,t5_2sw2n
