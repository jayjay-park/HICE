2307932,0,t1_clmzmw9,This isnt the first time a bracket breaking error has happened though.  weeks ago the UCSD team played in the ivylol qualifier.  of their opponents didnt show up and those games were reported by UCSD as forfeit from the other teams. However for some reason UCSD was marked as  and knocked out of the bracket. This forced UCSD to play another qualifier which they swept  probably knocking out another team that would have potentially qualified had there not been an error in the first place. Tournaments like this need to be better organized. The amount of complaints Ive been seeing and hearing throughout this entire tournament are ridiculous yet most of them are justified as the organization has been rather poor.,IvyLoL,clwz6ch,1,t5_2uwhf
