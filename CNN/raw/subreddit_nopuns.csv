8058985,0,t3_4pgz78,Antijokes are the exact spirit of this sub. Surrounded by puns on all fronts attacked with low grade word play assaults what other recourse does mankind have except to fight back? Remove the pun from a bad joke and you remove the facade of the humor and in so show how empty and pointless the whole thing was in the first place. It points out its flaws while not alienating the fact that humor can still be a part of our lives. Even though we neednt debase ourselves with the lowest common denominator of it.,nopuns,d4lwmmj,5,t5_2z1ez

11075065,0,t1_del7lyn,As you very well should. To be quite honest since discovering this sub modhood here is one of my personal goals. I will do my best to hang around and be a smartass free of wordplay until the glorious day I can ban the verbal sin that tarnishes this good land.Specifically my roommate. I am going to find his Reddit account and ban the bastard like he deserves. I put up with four years of not getting a straight answer out of whats up or How are you doing and the Skype calls. The Skype calls! I needed freakin earplugs not to go hoarse from groans of rage! The only thing worse than a pun enthusiast is a conversation full of them!Uh ahem. Thank you for your service. Carry on.,nopuns,denck98,2,t5_2z1ez
