This morning he spent a good ten minutes while I was doing our usual gentle cuddle and rock before naptime hurling himself as hard as he physically could backwards in my arms and then throwing himself forward so he headbutted me really fricking hard in the mouth. Over and over and over. Eventually I just had to put him down and walk away and take a breather for  minutes before I lost it. He did then go to sleep but was up half an hour later.

Could you try nursing lying down in bed might take him a tiny getting used to but then the milk dribbles out if theres too much just be sure to put a towel underneath you! or letting the let down spray into a cloth? For the first  months I had burp cloths or any cloth laying around allllll over my house... Sometimes it was a sock or tshirt lol so when he unlatches and it sprays have that towel handy and let it spray in there. Also be careful pumping before nursing because that could possibly compound the problem by upping your supply. Try manually squeezing your boobies to get the letdown to happen into the cloth before nursing or just squeeze enough out so maybe it wont all crazy once he goes to nurse. And boobie pads. So many boobie pads. ,breakingmom,cflijvh,4,t5_2y6ap

He said he had a headache and his stomach was bubbly. No diarrhea or vomiting just really crampy. He was apparently well enough to play Diablo III all afternoon laughing with his brothers but still sick. I took care of the kid ran errands babied my partner all that jazz.Monday rolls around and would you look at that now Im sick. SO has to go to work at . Im still up and taking care of the kid basically by myself because lol getting help with mommy duties amiright?  I run to the bathroom at mach speed for my first of five puke of the day. I dont make it in the toilet thanks to that goddamn lifesaver toilet lock. Im sitting in a massive pool of my own chunky vomit its all over the toilet lid all over the floor its splashed up on the counters and on the sides of the tub... And as Im puking left and right I have the dog and the screaming baby trying to push the door open to come in. Im pushing back because god help me they cant be in here but theyre both barkingscreaming nuclear meltdown throwing themselves against the door to get in. I scream my SOs name he freaks out and starts yelling at me to calm the fuck down and just hand the baby to him. I cant hand the baby to you Im puking my guts out! And then what does he say once Im done hurling? I gate the bedroom off to keep the still screaming toddler out as I strip off my vomitcovered clothing and start searching for cleaning supplies. He says I have to go to work. Dude if you need me to leave early just say so. And then he leaves. I notice that the clock is  he doesnt have to leave for work until .Thanks a fucking lot. I dont even... I know that he doesnt handle vomit well. Honestly I havent met a single man that does. Every man Ive known sees blood or vomit and instantly bails out. Believe it or not this situation me puking over and over again while baby cries over being abandoned instead of helping me he leaves has happened before twice. Im so freaking sick of being expected to suck it up. Im going to do what I can but damn it man. I need a little help here. My only saving grace was that when he let it slide when he came home and observed that our son trashed the apartment I was basically toilet and couchbound the entire day standing up for more than a few minutes sent me to the toilet.TLDR Feel you there.

Lets have you stay in your room in fear constantly! The troll said that you need to know to control it? Nah just be afraid of it. Also shut your sister out! Thatll produce healthy relationships later on! THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A SUPERVILLIAN! I knew Hans was bad. It was too perfect. Seriously Anna predicts true love and then gets it? Too coincidental. Why does Olaf get to talk but Sven doesnt? I want a talking reindeer! Kristoff was the only real person with flaws and virtues in this movie similar to Flynn Rider in Tangled. Love is an Open Door sounds like its advocating swinging...  Shoe size doesnt matter yes it does. Dont lie Disney. It matters.  Anna is WAY too naive and trusting. Fear of the unknown people place etc is an important evolutionary trait. did it bother anyone else how sexy they made Elsa? The slit up the dress is what does it for me... She looks like shes  instead of . An emotionally stunted  at that... Why does Idina Menzel sound like shes screaming all the time when she sings?

Hes been getting his finances in order taking on more responsibility at work etc. Hes also had several deaths of close family members since the baby was born so I do cut him some slack there too. Its hard to give up your vices when youve got stress coming in at all sides. Does that make it right? Absolutely not.

I said temporary birth control not permenant because they can turn their life around and get their children back. The issue with addicts is they do NOT see past their next high. Sex tonight  baby tomorrow does not occur to them. That Is what makes them act as they do. Now am I saying here is this girl who takes pain pills to frequently? No. I am talking about actual drug addicts that have been roaming the streets for years and years with three kids already in state care. It is cold a callous to say fuck the mother protect the child but in truth the mother did make her bed. That innocent child did not. If you saw how children are treated in foster homes . If you have felt what it is like to be home of these kids you would wish someone stopped your mother for continuously getting pregnant.to top it off the children of addicts have a higher rate it addiction so the cycle continues. It needs to be stopped at the source. Just telling a woman hey there is north control here when she is on a two week binge on dope is doing nothing. She doesnt care. To say. We are putting this birth control in to help out long term you can have it removed if when you get clean. Most likely she will see the logic but if not..I mean..god just these people dont need to keep fucking up little innocent children. ,breakingmom,chocdt1,1,t5_2y6ap

1245406,0,t3_28crb6,Hello fellow expat! We did the long flight and visiting my family not that long ago. First on the plane try to get a bulkhead row seat. Some flights have seats that you can put a car seat or a little carry cot on during the flight. At the very least it gives a little extra room for the baby to sit and crawl around during the flight. We paid a bit extra for those seats I think but it was well worth the money. Have some new toys to give to her on the plane that shes never seen before. This will help distract her. Have some shows she likes on a phone or tablet that she can watch. And books to read to her. And during take off and landing have her nurse or at least suck on a binky. This will help her ears pop. And try to tire her out before you get on the plane. Let her crawl around and get as much energy out that she can. My daughter wouldnt sleep in the cot provided her but did sleep most of the flights when I held her. And if she does scream the whole time remember that the flight will eventually end and that youll never have to see those people ever again. As for the family stuff I say if shes happy enough hanging out with them let yourself have a little break. Maybe not go to a hotel but at least go on a date or two with your husband. I know it can be annoying hearing people be possessive of your kid but theyre just excited. And they know their time with her and you is limited so they want to have as much time with her as they can. Let them. Enjoy the help while you have it. And overlook the possessive stuff. Look at the motivation and not the annoying words. And yeah jet lag sucks ass. Her sleeping will be messed up for a bit. Going over was easier than coming home for our baby. Much much easier. We cosleep so I have no reference about how she may do in a pack and play or changing from her own room to sharing again.

Mine has gone for three years now and it has done wonders for him in all aspects of his life. Now I skipped the part about your husband having two jobs. Id keep checking around to see what all your options are. You may find one cheaper than that. Is there any chance you can do something while hes at school to make extra money?

Talked on and on about the bond and all the fun stuff they wanna do with her and how much they want to help us. Sooooo we found a house we loved so we bought it.

She was worried that if she didnt teach me the truth then I would hear other stuff from older kids and then not understand or get the wrong ideas about stuff.  Might seem early to some people but I plan to do the same.

2086186,0,t3_2ir9jn,As opposed to specifically trying to come up with punishments for some of her transgressions I would try to make it so that she has to take responsibility for her actions. What does the school say about unexcused tardiness? Does she receive detention? Does her teacher get to knock points off of her grade? I would talk with the schoolher teacher and see what they feel is appropriate. I feel that it would be more effective for her first period teacher to be handing out a punishment for her being late. It is her responsibility to get her butt up and out the door to school on time. You wont be ensuring that she wakes up or leaves at any specific time. If she doesnt get to school on time she faces whatever consequence that the school says she does. If her consequences from the school negatively effect her grades or cause her to break any house rules ex she has an obligation after school for the family which she cannot meet because she has detention  tough shit now you have two punishments the school detention and the home punishment for not meeting your family obligation then she will face a consequence at home. Further talk with her about the very real consequences of smoking and drinking while underage  if she gets caught drinking at any point before she turns  the police may have the right to take away her license until that point check your local laws to see if this is applicable. If this happens you wont be driving her ass anywhere that she could reasonably take herself to unless you are already going to that same place. She will need to learn how to transport herself to wherever she needs to go walk bike bus find rides from friends. Any tickets she receives are her responsibility and her responsibility alone. You wont be paying one dime towards them. She should already be taking an active role at home so yes I agree with that one!Since she has lost your trust by being late to school drinking and smoking youre taking away her bedroom door. Oh how will she change her clothes? Thats her problem not yours. She disrespected you and her father by participating in illicit activities without your knowledge under your roof. That is rude and disrespectful towards you as her parents  you are the people that put that roof over her head  you are more than happy to do so but you ask that she respect you as a parent and homeowner and not do illegal things in your house. She can have her door back when you feel that she has earned your trust back  have regular discussions with her about her behavior and what she is doing to gain back that trust. In regards to her excuses and having an answer for everything  when shes late for curfew  you dont  much care the reason. The end result was that she was late. She broke the rule and now she suffers a consequence. Oh there was a train? Sorry next time learn to leave to come home earlier.  I think the most annoying one I dealt with was when I was late because I was out with my boyfriend and his friends some friends including my boyfriend decided to go to a movie but I had to be home for curfew so my boyfriend got me a ride with one of his friends home instead of driving me himself. The dbag I got a ride home with decided to race the car next to him and then got pulled over causing me to break curfew. Lesson learned? Dont take rides home from asshole friends. These things will allow her to learn to have more personal responsibility. She will learn to take responsibility for her actions and also put herself in situations where she isnt going to get herself in trouble due to other people making bad decisions. ,breakingmom,cl500fu,2,t5_2y6ap

2109970,0,t1_cl7wxev,Sometimes ideals amp things arent worth it ! Sometimes you gotta know when to walk away. I know thats never easy. But you need to sit back put your emotions amp fears aside and look at whats really going on. What is your situation teaching your child? How is it effecting who you are ? If you stay right where you are where will you be in  years  not based on a fairytale version of what you wish but judge it based on facts ? And is that where you want to be ? Is that who you want to be ?   I was with my first sons father for  years. We split when our baby was . His mom hated me from day one. She still does  He was abusive emotionally very often. I wasnt allowed to drive or have a phone. If I needed anything like clothes or pads I would have to beg.  I was treated like I was never good enough I wasnt cool enough for him amp his friends. Him amp his family expected me to work after I had my baby with no sitter no ride  we live in a small town wno public trans. and they werent willing to help provide any of those things.    my parents are super unreliable and tend to do a lot of dope so I couldnt call them to help   Blah blah blah  we fought often  amp we finally broke up  but I couldnt quit hanging on to hope that our little family  would get back together.  He strung me along for  years. For  of those  I slept on peoples couches or at his place if he was feeling horney all while toting his kid around with me.  He convinced me not to file for child support and I struggled so fucking hard it hurts to think about.  When I finally had given up on him amp started dating someone else he came right back to me  with all these sweet promises and a month later I was pregnant again.  And he told me he couldnt raise another mans child and walked out only to further string me along. He would call me to come spend the night then get pissed at me the next day would force me to walk my pregnant ass home  at that point I had to suck it up amp move into my parents house  full of drugs it fucking sucked that was a  minute drive from his place he would pick me up only to get pissed and drop me off on the side of the road.  Even after all the fucked up shit he put me through he still shit gold in my eyes. I had absolutely nothing but love amp devotion for this guy.  After the new baby came he moved out of state and quit calling.  Which was probably the best thing that could of happened to me. It gave me a chance to really reflect on the situation. amp I was finally able to see what was really happening. How I had allowed myself to be treated and what my life would have been like if things hadnt ended. About  years after the birth of my second. I got a phone call from him he wanted to hang out amp I agreed. I was excited and nervous. amp had all these fantasies of what was going to happen. Then he knocked on my door and sat on my couch. amp probably for the first time I saw this person for who he truly was. amp in that moment I realized my self worth amp new what I wanted for my future amp for my kids future  amp it wasnt being treated like I was less than or being manipulated or used or unsupported. amp I knew that I didnt want my boys to grow up to be that way.   But it was only when my emotions amp fears were taken out that I could finally see what was happening.  I dont know your situation but it doesnt sound healthy. amp I wanted to share this with you in hopes that it might at least give you the strength to look beyond your self doubt amp your fears and make the best choice for you and your children. ,breakingmom,cl80ti5,5,t5_2y6ap

We had to have a come to Jesus talk about how shit is going to work. I still let him play his games but he has to help me around the house and take care of LO whenever I asked no questions. Guys somethings think that just because we stay at home that we arent working which is total bullshit.  I went away for a few days and left my hubby with the kids and all the work and he quickly reazlied that I do a shit more than he thought. Sit him down and talk to him. If that doesnt work get rid of the gaming machine until he can understand that he is a father now and being one doesnt start when the child gets fun.

I will never ever ever agree to an arrangement like this again. I didnt want to in the first place.

I think my housemate would totally cut all contact if she could. BUT she works indirectly with my fiance. And she has asked us for a letter stating that we dont want her to live with us any more even though we havent said this and I was completely happy to give her a reasonable deadline to sort her shit out and I think thats because shes applying for some kind of crisis housing.. and this is despite the fact she is salaried and earns more than my fiance and only has herself to support.,breakingmom,clkk1lv,1,t5_2y6ap

I do most of it so I know where the extra diapers are to check the diaper bag before leaving when to offer snacks when to step in and referee and when to ignore the bickering etc. But instead of micro managing him I offer protips and also try to set him up for success. For instance I will make sure the diaper stuck is visible and full enough for the time he will be parent on duty. Same w wipes and rash cream. Before he takes the  yo to swim I throw together the swim bag bc I know where the swim cap and goggles are and will remember to include a towel. Or I say protip if youre showering with them let them play with the sprayer while you step out dry off and get dressed. The big one can turn off the water safely and that way youre not wet and naked chasing after the little one.Another thing I noticed is if I dont speak up he may be clueless. He isnt always going to notice that Im busy making dinner and the little one has a poop diaper. So I can call out to him hey could you please take a look at his diaper? Or can you see why the two of them are crying? My husband is an aspie so I never assume he notices his environment.

The second went perfectly and I was back to  by the end of the first week just really sore. Planning allowed my husband to get his time off set up and for us to set up babysitting for the first few days..Since my first delivery went badly I couldnt sit up and hold my first was on soooo many medications and I ended up with bad PPD. I tried breastfeeding but it never happened. With my second it took lots of pumping supplements and work but I was able to breastfeed her. It was totally worth the effort..My first had just turned  when the second came. I think it was well planned. She was old enough to help grab diapers and bottles and be a big helper. She was also old enough to understand that I was sore and the baby needed attention. Now theyre close enough in age to play together and share toys..Im cheap as fuck and couldnt justify buying cute infant furniture.

So in her stupid little mind she doesnt pay child support but for daycare. Cue this year when he is no longer in daycare because hes in school. Shes complaining about Paying for daycare costs he no longer has.Bitch you pay child support not daycare fees. How we utilize the child support money is our business.,breakingmom,cm5dg5b,2,t5_2y6ap

I dont want to make love with him anymore so I fake it once a month or so. Its so empty and then I resent him even more. Then he does stupid little stuff like just now. A few minutes ago I pointed out that the bag of asparagus he bought was rotten. He didnt say anything about going to the store to get more. Then he said see you in a bit and I asked where he was going. To the store but in the most you are a dumbass voice you can imagine. Ok sorry.Earlier today I calmly brought up some passive aggressive stuff hes said lately. Hes asked me to be more assertive and tell him at a time when we can have a conversation when something is bothering me. So I thought I did that. But no.

2601824,0,t1_cmxwbev,My mom and I adopted out of foster care and it both more complicated and more simple than this. First the state continues to pay a stipend and health insurance for our kids even after the adoption. So theres a significant upside. I cannot say whether all states do this but ours did. But adopting out of foster care is actually a little tough. There are kids who have already had parental rights terminated necessary for adoption who are shall we say on the market. But these tend to be large sibling groups or special need kids. Which doesnt mean they dont also need homes but there simply arent adorable fiveyearolds with limited issues hanging out in the wings waiting for parents. You can actually browse the list of available kids in the US in foster care which is how I know this. That being said adoption placements go to adoptionfocused homes. This is how most people get older children. We for instance were not adoption focused. We took in large sibling groups but never had the intention of adopting. There are homes out there looking specifically to adopt a child and they get placements where the outcome will likely be TPR. Either the mom and dad are known quantities and the state already suspects theyll lose their rights or the circumstances are so horrific that theres very little chance the child will be returned. But even the latter first right of refusal goes to relatives and a lot of times a cousin or aunt will at the last minute decide they want the kids. That doesnt mean they have have them but it drags out the process. When it works out thats awesome. When it doesnt it can mean you bond with a child and raise them sometimes for up to two or three years only to have them go back to parents or a family member. That can be realllllly hard on people. You are always a foster home first and adoptive home second so you always stand the risk of losing the placement. But the last thing the thing no one likes to talk about is that foster kids are pretty screwed up as a rule. Again this doesnt preclude taking them and it certainly doesnt mean your biological child wont have issues all their own as well. But you do have to deal with a lot of the emotional fallout. The severity of course depends on why they were removed and what they faced before removal but typically they come with challenges. This can be as small as food hoarding or parentification and as serious as a child who because of their own sexual abuse attempts to sexualize other kids in the home. Oftentimes the state has limited information when they call you to take a kid so some problems can be real surprises. You have to be willing to commit to a whole slew of issues but also be willing to draw certain lines for your own sanity. One of ours was arson....any incidents or history of arson and that kid was gone. So even potential adoption placements that have everything go right can still mean that kid proves not to be a good fit with your family. I am not down on foster care. Someday when we have space and time my partner and I will be a placement home. But I feel like people are radically misinformed about what it means to adopt out of that system. Its a huge commitment with a lot of potential pitfalls. You have to know what youre getting into. That being said it was an amazing experience and completely worth every single moment. But you cant come at it with blinders on. ,breakingmom,cmy72rp,9,t5_2y6ap

I dont think he did it because he didnt love us I think he did it because he was tired and in pain. A couple of years ago I was hitting the wall myself I didnt really want to die exactly but I was so exhausted and unhappy that I just wanted my life to be over. I wanted to sleep forever and never wake up. I knew I had a duty to my family but I was just so worn out that I was at the end of my rope. I never made any threats but my husband knew something was very wrong. He was right I was secretly trying to schedule my suicide I had it all planned out it was going to look like an accident but I dont want to go into details when he told me he knew something was wrong and begged me to see my doctor.Well. I had depression and anxiety all right...but I also had celiac disease! Turns out your body cant produce enough serotonin for your brain if you have a disease that affects nutrient absorption. I thank God every day to be alive and to have this second chance. My husband and my amazing doctor saved my life.I guess what Im saying is...your dad probably did love you. He was sick and in pain and his illness killed him. It wasnt that he didnt love you enough to stay.

Ignore him completely while hes in time out except to put him back in. Do not lose your cool. That reinforces the boundariesrules you have in place.

Then resume the fun stuff like watching a movie together or playing with playdoh making cookies with cookie cutters let him play with some toys in the sink full of soapy water shit like that. That makes it clear to him that when he acts like a jackass he doesnt get to be having fun.

So its just not that important to me especially after thinking about my age when kids are grown. I want to have fun and have money for shit I want to do. Cant have that with another damn  years added on from when the first one GTFOs. And as if that wasnt enough think about paying for another going to college and their eventual weddings.

3003018,0,t3_2ukqwl,If your kids have all their vaccinations they likely wont be affected by people who arent.  There is a slight slight slight chance your kids could get the diseases they are vaccinated against but if they do it should be a mild form.The issue is if you could not get the vaccine a child that is too young to get certain vaccines MMR starts at  months a child whos immune system is compromised cancer or a person who is allergic to part of the vaccine eggs for example.  Some people can get all their vaccinations but still not develop immunization to a certain disease. These people rely on the herd immunity where everyone who is able to get the vaccine does so the group doesnt get sick which means those listed above wont come in contact with someone sick and get the disease.Now that parents are not vaccinating their kids they are at a greater risk of getting a disease then spreading it to others that arent vaccinated like what happened at Disney.  And these diseases arent just a pain in the neck that you have to stay home a few days then youre fine as Roald Dahl wrote in his letter his daughter seemed to be on the mend from having the measles and then  hours later she was dead.

This roll was so well sealed that no water from any of the baths I gave him all of which included tilting his head back and scrubbing his neck penetrated it. It was a fight to get in there. He clawed and screamed like I was beheading him. But once I knew there was rollception going on I was not stopping. I got in there and scrubbed and the smell was gone. Id have to repeat the torture every two days for a while until he grew a real neck otherwise the smell came back like clockwork. Could your baby have a rollception of her own going on?

I would certainly love to tell other people that hey the CVS in this part of town doesnt have a changing table but Walgreens right nextdoor does so by all means go by your diapers there. Yes this is totally based on an incident where I had just panicbought diapers and wipes from a CVS only to find that there wasnt even a decent place for me to get down on my hands and knees to change my poocovered baby on the floor in the bathroom and so I had to take my son outside and change him in the back of my car in  weather. Then a couple of weeks later I happened to be in a Walgreens that was right near that same damn CVS and voila changing table. I can and will make buying decisions based upon whether or not its an okay place for me to bring my kids. Not having a place for me to change my child means that its not a good place for me to bring my kid. And I really really freaking hate having to change my child outside or in my car when its really cold outside. I know I would hate it if I had to basically get naked from the waist down and have a cold wet wipe dragged over my tender bits when its  outside!,breakingmom,cpc7cwt,3,t5_2y6ap

If he can cut into our time for work Im just wondering if Im being unreasonable by asking him to cut I to work time occasionally for his family. Him working longer hours really isnt much of an issue. It can become annoying when its the th day in a row that hes eaten dinner at the computer instead of with us but its his choice to make. He does most of the work when my son is asleep when he brings it home after hours so its not like we have plans or anything. I dont fault him for working instead of spending time with me.. Hed just be playing video games otherwise. Lol. We have discussed it and we are looking into daycare part time but its a significant stretch in our budget since hes the only one bringing in a paycheque. Until we figure that out I just dont know what to do. We have no friends or family close that can come help so its just us. When he refuses to come home I feel trapped since theres literally no one to fall back on. It all falls on me and I worry that my son is the one suffering when we have days like this because I just cant parent as efficiently and lovingly as I should be. ,breakingmom,cpcrbz2,2,t5_2y6ap

If I stood up and rocked her she would quiet down but you can only rock on your hears for so long before your legs start to give out. I would spontaneously cry and I felt like a failure. I have had depression since childhood and I have done pretty well on preventing episodes coping with episodes and whatnot. So one thing I know is I have to psych myself up for hard times. And those times were fucking hard.So about two weeks after birth I came across Roseanne at about midnight I found out about their nightly marathons that night. Every night for about  hours. It was my saving grace.I got excited about being alive again. When my little baby would start crying I would say out loud Oh good! Roseanne is about to start! and I would arrange my station. Channel  snack on the table remote on the arm blanket draped on the other arm in such a way that I could cover us both if she happened to fall asleep and I was sitting down. I turned the captions on the tv so I could still follow.And I laughed. And laughed. It saved my life. Not in a romantic kind of way but in a sad and real kind of way. If I hadnt found that sliver of hope I dont believe I would have made it through it.She is now almost . Still a pain in the ass.

I really wonder how often people have this kind of perception disconnect.

I will say that in both cases where a no contact eventually came into place  the kids lead happy healthy lives. Those kids will grow up and eventually learn at least a some of the back story.

3800875,0,t3_33vwdo,You guys get it. You know when I was a kid I used to wonder why my mom didnt have any friends she has fibro too but I get it now. Honestly most days outside of a flare up like the one Im in the middle of right now its not even the pain thats unbearable. I mean how painful is eating dinner with a friend vs eating dinner with my husband? But its the fatigue that kills me. I have to stay on nuvigil just to stay awake even when Im not flaring and thats worn off by  or  pm. Without the nuvigil my sleepiness had an almost narcoleptic feel to it but my doc says its all part of the fibro. Hopefully things will get a little bit easier when all  kids are in school and a little bit more independent but we will have to see since thats another  years away. On the months that hes home my husband has agreed to try to help out more. I think hed forgotten how bad I feel sometimes until this last time he was home and he saw me have a really bad flare up after our  year old had surgery. In the meantime though its a month before he gets home to help out. Little guy is fine by the way he just had to have a retractile testicle tacked back into place,breakingmom,cqpj2zb,1,t5_2y6ap

It sounds easy but I know it can be hard to get the bugger in the stroller at times.  Just a little sunshine will do wonders and you can pop in some headphones and listen to whatever you want for  minutes.  If the baby cries the baby cries.  You need some alone time.   Talk to your spousepartner.  Studies have shown that it is hard for a father to bond with their child before  months while a mother is more likely to bond sooner and therefore takes more of the load.  Just because you have the magical boobs does not mean you need to be with the baby .  At  weeks the baby can go without milk for an hour or two.  Even if its a trip to the grocery or sitting at a coffee shop hand the baby off to the hubby and get out of the house.

Dont be afraid to ask for what you think you are worth and be prepared to back it up with reasons why youre great.  Often times when people get new jobs they jump in salary as raises can stagnate especially when youre in a job a long time.   What if I hate it?     Find out as much as you can about the company before hand about the work they do atmosphere etc.   That will help you decide if its a good fit.   If you know someone who works there or know someone who knows someone offer to take them out to lunch to chat about the company.  Not in a Tell me all the gossip but in a Hows the work atmosphere there? way.     Go into the interview and get as much info as you can about what the job would entail.   If you do take the job and you hate it just stick with it and look for a new job.  You can always say to the second new company that the other one wasnt as good as fit as you thought it would be. I have five weeks vacation per year.  This is one that you cant counterpoint until youve been at the new place awhile.  But if you hate your old place then it might be a bullet you have to bite to get out of that bad job.  During the interview send out feelers on what kind of vacation packages you get but at the end of the interview so its not like you are asking about what the company will do for you before you ask about what you can do for the company. I have reasonable flexibility where I work.  You might have some flexibility with the new job too.  During the interview see if teleworking comes up and if not ask if that is something that they allow.  Or flex time.  You go in early and come home early.  Or come home early and then put in the rest of your hours later in the evening. Im so fucking scared.    So if you go in and they suck then they suck and you say no if they offer you the job and you keep looking for a new job.     If you suck and they say no then you learn from your mistakes and you keep looking for a new job.     If the job sounds great and the salary is not what you want tell them that you want XX and back it up with why you are all that and a bag of chips.   Always remember just because they offer you the job that does not mean you have to take it.  You are free to turn it down if it doesnt feel right.

Toys books snacks looking out the window checking out the people around us and sometimes videospictures on the phone moreso now I dont know at  months. I bring either a travel pillow or travel nursing pillow it helps support my arm and avoid dangly baby teeth ouch.We nurse usually around takeoff after shes done being entertained by the plane and depending on how close it is to nap time and what time of day the flight is she might take a nap. The tough part is what I eat so make sure to pack yourself some snacks or convenient food too either food youre going to share or food you can eat with one hand you know the drill P. If you nurse during landing too you can usually avoid the ears adjusting. Or if your baby starts to get super crabby during landing try nursing and see if you can relieve it the sucking usually does it.With a . hour flight Id make sure they were freshly changed before and only change them on the plane if they poop. Remember a changing pad and change them after you land. Look for a family bathroom its less of a show.

Point out to him some fallacies like if people are only gay because of child abuse why would playing the flute make him gay? Is soccer really on the same par as molestation?

4493846,0,t3_3cmqd0,Our first long one was hr drive at about  months old. We left in the middle of the night so he slept through a big chunk of the drive. I sat in the backseat with him so I was able to help keep him entertained but he did really well with a bunch of his fave books ampamp a few fave toys. Had the iPad ready but hardly used it. I put together a small photo album mostly him but also other family and he LOVED that thing. Anything with music and lights was a big hit. I also picked up a few small new toys so hed have some new things to investigate. We didnt drive for long stretches at once maybe  hrs max and when we stopped we made sure it was somewhere he could run around a bit to burn off some energy whether grabbing food at a drive through then finding a park or school yard nearby thank heavens for smart phones! and have a short picnic or even just zip through a grocery market or something. Last fall we had a bigger trip...dont remember what our total mileage was but we were in the car for  hrs a day for  days...one way...with a newly potty trained andabit year old and no potty! Talk about risk takers lolWe left in the middle of the night from home again but other days we just left after breakfast. Anyway again lots of books a few fave toys. Bought a bunch of small things mostly dollar store stuff to wrap up so that every so often he could open a treat. Some days it was only  or  times the whole day sometimes it was like every  hours. But it was helpful if he was restless or grumpy to have that something to look forward to. Nothing big like one of the big hits was a calculator he loves numbers...or some glow sticks for after dark a little notepad and crayons etc. I found a small plastic container and cut some slits in it and hed just sit and push buttons through it.The best thing I brought was a baking sheet and magnets. I got him number ampamp alphabet magnet sets from the dollar store so we wouldnt lose any of the ones we already had and really any kind of magnets I could find cheap and he spent soooooo much time with that. I made a few magnets by printing stuff from the net gluing it on a cereal box then gluing that on magnetic sheets also dollar store...shapes animals etc. I found a few coloring books that have a little brush you put water into and then paint the pages which would fade back to white after they dried so they could be used over and over again and had regular coloring books ampamp crayons but he only used the water ones. Also of course small snacky stuff like granola bars pretzels etc that arent messy. Made sure he always had his fave blanket nearby and sometimes hed just sit and snuggle with that while watching scenery. We did take the ipad again and it was def used more this trip but a lot of the time he just used it to play music he liked although we did bring a few CDs to play too. I bought a small plastic bin that held a lot of the stuff and sat next to his seat so either he could reach it or I could reach it from the front street. We also took a break every  or  hours and made sure to find a playground once in a while and let him go run around. I didnt think Id have enough of the surprise items for the trip home so I picked up a few small things as we were sightseeing or shopping and put them in paper lunch bags... but it turned out that wed have been ok without them had some left over when we got home. I took way more than he needed or used I guess I wasnt giving him enough credit because he could actually sit without doing anything for stretches while I was worried about keeping him entertained every minute of the trip. He is such a good little traveller were lucky because we love doing road trips. Weve made  hour drives a number of weekends over the last  months and we really dont have to bring much for him its awesome. The other advice Id offer is not get too bent out of shape if you wind up not sticking to a schedule ...we had goals for how far wed like to go each day but if we ended up making an unplanned playground trip or took more breaks or spent more time having lunch or just didnt feel like going further it was fine. Other days it was easier to make time up and in the end after  days what does it matter if you arrive a couple of hours later than you figured.

4636416,0,t3_3ehg0y,Do you have male family members he can interact with? Male friends? Teachers? Coaches or instructors? All of these can be positive male role models. I have always encouraged my son to do what he likes if he wants to wear pink or watch Monster High or whatever but as hes gotten older hes just not into the girly stuff as much. So dont freak out if someday he declines having his nails painted my son used to but doesnt any longer. Being gender positive doesnt mean pushing stuff on him that he truly doesnt like sometimes boys like boy stuff and not girl stuff. Not to say youll do this but a lot of parents try so hard to be accepting that they seem unable to wrap their heads around the fact that their son actually likes guns and cars instead of dollies. As for Santa etc I dont consider it lying. Its telling a story. Im a writer and storytelling is different from lying. I never felt traumatized or that my parents betrayed me when I discovered Santa is not a real physical person and I think people who claim they were traumatized already had issues before that.As for the dad thing there are all kinds of families and if you expose your kid to lots of different people then he will see all kinds of families. Just be prepared to explain this when he asks because he will. My personal advice is dont try to stem his natural male impulses. Boy often like to play fight or have mock battles and thats OK. Play violence helps them work out how the world goes. Dont try to make him sit still if he wants to move. Thats just my opinion though as a mother of two boys.

4649537,0,t1_ctglcjt,Thank you for your advice. I spoke with a family lawyer when we first broke up and she basically gave me a lot of the same advice as far as keeping things civil goes. I feel like hes doing the same thing  just stringing me along while he gets what he wants. He is really good with our daughter and she just goes nuts when she sees him. It gives me a glimpse into what things could be I think thats what makes me want to fight for our relationship. I dont want to walk away knowing I didnt give it everything I could. On the other hand I cant always be the one getting fucked over. He has offered to take her so I can have time to myself but its hard for me to do that because I dont trust that he will take care of her the way she needs to be taken care of. I think counselling will be good regardless of if we get back together or not. I know I need it   the past year has put me in a position where I definitely feel like I know what the word broken means. I want us to be able to communicate properly and I want us to understand each other. I think seeing a professional might help with that but I might be grasping at straws there. As it stands I currently attend their visits at his request. He feels its best for us to spend what little time we have together as a family. I have made it clear that from now on the visits will be taking place elsewhere  I will be going to court to have an order that will back me up on that. Im not sending my daughter to his bachelor pad to hang out with a bunch of asstards who couldnt be fucked to even ask about her. I dont know   when your best friend had a kid dont you think youd be a little bit interested? But I might just be being bitchy there. I think I might give it a few months or x amount of counselling sessions to see where we are at. I think youre right though my fear of doing this alone is tainting my decisions.

4670049,0,t3_3ewgva,So a few months ago I pulled into the gas station and was next in line at a pump. The car there left but I had to pull forward to get at the right angle to back in and while I was putting my car in reverse some bitch swooped in and took it. I honked my horn nothing. Rolled down the window they got out of the car. Im never confrontational but the nerve on these people... so I said something. The lady passenger not the driver looks at me and says Shes disabled meaning the driver which?? She can drive just fine??? I wasnt asking her to WALK away from the pump! then goes on her merry way to pay for gas and completely ignores the fact that they just cut me off. No apology nothing. This is the ONLY time Ive ever gotten the last word though I was still a coward about it. The guy at the pump on the other side of them waved me over since he was leaving and I pumped gas awkwardly a few feet away fuming. Just before I got back in my car and left they were still there I yelled at them. Being disabled is no excuse for being rude. You could have at least apologized.

4735951,0,t3_3fr44l,It is possible for a caregiver to confuse a babys need to suck with a need to feed.  They are not always one and the same.If your baby is hungry you should feed her. Please dont postpone responding to hunger cues because thats all she can do to let you know shes hungry.If youre worried about overfeeding make sure youre stopping for adequate burp breaks.  If she eats too much shell spit up even with the burp breaks.  IMO spitting up is pretty much the only reliable marker that will tell you when shes too full.In which case then youll know that you have a baby with an increased need to suck.On a case by case basis if you think shes eaten enough and that perhaps she just needs to suck you can offer her a pacifierbinky.  If that satisfies and she stops fussing then youll know she doesnt need more formula yet.  If the pacifier doesnt satisfy then chances are that she really  is still hungry.TLDR Use a binky to figure out if she wants to eat or if she just wants to suck.,breakingmom,ctrics5,2,t5_2y6ap

Who you were or what you did before you met him shouldnt matter. Im sure he wasnt a virgin when you met why should he expect you to be? And now hes beating you and calling you horrifically abusive names?? And he wont let you talk to your family about it?? RUN! Run fast and run far!!Think of it this way if in twenty years your daughter came to you and told you her boyfriend was treating her the way yours is treating you what would you tell her? What would you do?Even worse what if his anger does turn towards your little one? Do you want her growing up in this environment? Do you want her to watch your husband beat you or to think that its ok for women to be called sluts or whores? What if he starts hitting her? What if she hits puberty and he starts calling her a slut or a whore? You need to run. No one needs to just take it.

5053193,0,t3_3k5wpc,If you can manage to get a regular appointment time for OT that would make your situation easier.  A standard  job might still offer you some flexibility to take your daughter to her appointments depending on how frequent they are and the type of job you are looking for.  So perhaps once a week you could work from home or once a week take an extra long lunch but make up the time at the beginning or end of the day or spread out throughout the week. Other jobs like retail could also work if your daughters appointments were on a regular schedule.  Perhaps other people might have some advice about how to approach discussing your need for a somewhat flexible schedule.Just to add another perspective you note in another comment that you worked really hard to obtain your degree so think long term about you too!  Coming up even financially while working at your career for a few years until you are not paying for full time day might be worth it in the long run.  ,breakingmom,cuv3ntw,4,t5_2y6ap

Im sure that was aimed more at her than you and the judge is probably sick of her shit. They have to be fair and biased but they know a pig in lipstick when they see one.Emotional abuse and manipulation is much more difficult to deal with than physical. If that is what is going on in that house youve got one hell of an uphill battle going. If anything maybe at least see about having the kids talk to a counselor. It might help the kids have someone they can talk to in private that is impartial that can help them deal with a very shitty situation. And Im sorry your dipshit ex is dragging everyone through the suck because who know why. People think that those who put through dysfunctional or abusive childhoods dont love or like their kids. Sadly that is just not true. They mostly do love their children they are just really blind and ignorant to what they are doing to their kids out of their own selfishness. Sometimes the best thing you can give to the kids in that situation is the knowledge that its not normal its not their fault and giving a face and a name to the hidden feeling that something isnt right instead of letting them think that its them.If you ever want to talk Im here.

He gets himself out of bed he is responsible for getting his snack and juice for school I will make him a sandwich or he will buy lunch.  He is required to get himself dressed and be ready for school without prompting.  He takes showers on my insistence because somewhere between  and  he started telling me that he didnt need showers but he is old enough to stink now.  He walks to and from the bus stop alone.  He has to finish his homework first thing when he gets home from school.  He is allowed to ask for help and I practice his spelling words with him but everything else is his responsibility. He cleans his room with much prodding and sometimes punishment. He feeds and waters the cat. Cleans up the baby toys for me twice a day. Folds and puts away his laundry. He cleans up the dinner table after dinner including wiping down the table and he puts clean dishes away. He collects any recycling that needs to go out on Sunday night and make sure it is in the bin for Monday pick up. He brings in the recycle bins from the curb on Mondays after school.  If he was a bit bigger and could lift more he would be taking the trash out on Monday mornings before school but he cant lift the bags yet... we are working on it. The only thing he gets an allowance for is watching his baby brothers.  If I require him to watch the babies for more than an hour while I cook dinner or something I will transfer  into his savings account. I feel like the babies are not his responsibility so any help he gives me there is rewarded.  The rest of his chores are unpaid because he is a functioning member of this household and should help the rest of us dont get paid for it. I have only left him home alone once.  Its not like I dont want to its just that I dont have the opportunity.  I am a SAHM and his stepdad works from home there is literally always someone here. His punishments include taking away his ipod video games or shutting off his wifi.  ,breakingmom,cvvg07v,2,t5_2y6ap

You can get an Otterbox Defender case for it for . on amazon.com.We just got the tablet for my yo for his birthday and you can either get apps through the app store OR you can sign up for this unlimited thing that is .month that gives him access to unlimited kid friendly apps shows books etc. and prevents him from getting into anything on the tablet that you dont want him to settings internet the app store so he can spend all of your money etc. Im not sure about Mickey Mouse but the little bit that Ive handled it Ive seen Wallykazam Jake and the Neverland Pirates and Daniel Tiger... so Im sure Mickey Mouse apps and such are available there too. The cool thing about it is that you can set up a separate profile for you and download apps that arent available through the kid thing youtube Netflix etc and transfer them to his profile so he can use that too. My kid doesnt have a case on it and has already dropped it a few times with no issues so it seems pretty durable. However youre probably better off getting a case because yours is much younger and likely to be WAY less careful.The Otterbox Defender case is fucking amazing. I have one on my phone and my nephew decided it would be a cool idea to throw my phone off of their porch which sits on top of their garage and onto the concrete driveway below. Not a scratch.

One picture was a bottle of formula captionedonly one bottle? This is how mothers lose their moral compass or even worse a onesie that said not the sharpest tool in the box captioned formula stunts brain development this onesie is the perfect gift for a formula fed baby. It was literally creepy. Unfortunately sometimes breastfeeding goes hand in hand with people thinking that not baby wearing co sleeping blw are forms of child abuse. I dont really understand why these people care so much about how others are raising their babies! Edit to add I love baby wearing because its super convenient but I feel like throwing my phone across the room when people suggest it as a panacea.

Prepare for well intentioned friends and family to say the exact wrong thing to you. Try not to throw a chair at them but I completely understand the desire to.

Wake up between  make breakfast LO gets up. Feed breakfast wash dishes switch over laundry. Play with kiddo. Pack snacks get to ready go to workout classwith stroller playgroup after if LO is tired home for nap if not grocery shop run errands. Home for nap clean up house start dinner. Wake up from nap... read books dance party art projects ect. Finish dinner. Dad comes home eat clean up dinner while dad plays with LO. Night time routine for LO. Laundry time with hubby self. Right now I need to rest cause doc said so. I am using nap time to rest so cleaning is not getting done. I have a partner who is very appreciative of what I do. He is happy when dinner is on the table and asks if he can help when it is not. He never complains if something doesnt get done. In return he has guys night once a week where I am all alone for  hours in one day. You never get a break when your a SAHM. Dont expect to shower use the bathroom alone or at least with someone at the door demanding to come in. Dont expect to be productive some days. If the kids are in a bad mood or sick your whole day is a waste. As the primary care giver my daughter pushes her boundaries more then anyone else. She will be in a middle of a tantrum because I wont let her have cookies when she hears her daddy. She will stop crying run to the door with a huge smile and greet him. I swear I hear this from all SAHM. When I leave and come home she is mad at me and gives me the silent treatment. Your children will push you and test you more then anyone. They will also want you more then anyone if they are sick or get hurt. My LO only wants me when she is not feeling well. I love what I do but I am always tired. I do night duty too because I want my hubby to be ready for work. My husband works  hour days so with a commute he is gone for  hours a day. That means if I get home from play group at noon I do not talk to another adult until  or  most days. I dont know how I will do  yet but I guess I will know very soon. Again my hubby is very supportive and appreciative of what I do and if he wasnt I would go back to work.

Its not about not wanting to see family its about treating your pets appropriately. Dont budge on that one.

And Im just sitting here in the corner like...ok somebody elses turn to figure this shit out then because I suck and Im not getting into it with random internet strangers over all the reasons we did things problems practicalities and and and WHERES MY DAMN BOOK THAT DOESNT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE SHIT FOR NIGHT NURSING OR WANTING THEM TO SLEEP LONGER THAN TWO HOURS AT A TIME.Frankly I knew before we started that CIO wasnt right for them. But I felt like we had no choice because of a lot of different factors that didnt seem to mesh with anything else cant always nurse to sleep because Im not always there cant rock them into drowsiness because were alone most of the time...and on and on. And then we kept at it and doubled down and started it on nap times after it kind of worked but not really. And then it only got worse from there. Because we couldnt see another option so we just kept trying to make it work.I dont know what Im saying. I thinyk Im trying to say that if it really is your best option then you dont need to see me as a cautionary tale before you even try. It just wasnt right for us. It could still be right for you. And if you only have one baby tapping your resources youll probably have the mental capacity to see whether or not its actually working in an appropriate time frame instead of shuffling around in zombie mode muttering but its the only thing we can do for three months.,breakingmom,cxbax1c,3,t5_2y6ap

Especially since she actually hurt herself pretty bad the first time. Going from the bed to the crib was an uphill battle. It was hard on her but harder on me.

Once daycare change is handled wait and see how you feel. If you still arent happy then work the problem and find an employment solution that works for your needs and your familys needs.

So the first time she repeated the word  shithead for example  I simply explained that is a really ugly word and she is not allowed to use it.   This has been my policy with every new word shes discovered.   Shes a pretty good listener  so I havent to tell her more than once not to say it  and I know when shes a teenager  shell get into it again.   But I just dont think its appropriate for her to use cuss words now.   When my daughter was little  I started subbing in fiddlesticks and thats kind of stuck with me.

Our daughter has always leaned more towards the low key end of things but loved being surrounded by kids her age. It made me a little annoyed to stick her with the younger kids at first but it ended up working out perfectly. Is it just the logistics with the wheelchair that is an issue? I wonder if there are any ruleslaws about that for daycares since most are private businesses. Sometimes I did feel like punching people in the face and sometimes I didnt. I think it depended on how and who said things. I think it is often used as a way for people to just say something because they dont know what else to say and sometimes they are genuine about it. But there are times when people say it because they dont want to hear about the whole thing because it makes them that uncomfortable and while I can understand where they are coming from it can be a bit invalidating. It can devalue your situation when really it is a big deal. Everyone has their shit but most people forget that not only are you going through THIS...you are also going through everything else that life is throwing your way.

I dont know if its just in my head because technically it wouldve been out of my system by the morning but I was groggy and lightheaded all day if I took it the night before. Dr. gave me a prescription for Lorazepam. I knew it has quite a bit of side effects and can be habitforming so I was told to not overdo it and only reserve it for when I really need it.  SIL whos a pharmacist signed off on it too so I figured it shouldnt hurt. Took it the first couple read  of nights and it has been a lot better ever since.  Another thing that were not supposed to do is apparently be on our phone  computer right before bedtime.

Somewhere between athiest and agnostic with easternhumanist tendencies. Hubs has taken a more neopagan approach.We celebrate Christmas as a time to be with family and celebrate love. Easter we will approach as similar to Thanksgiving. Some people celebrate for different reasons but we like going to see grandma! Our nanny is very religious and were comfortable with passive exposure from her. If shes saying prayers at lunch little bit doesnt have to leave the room or anything but shouldnt be required to participate. If she chooses to thats cool. We keep a mini shrine and candle that we light when we want to send good intentions or when were asking for good intentions. Daddy will teach her about elements and the power of nature while I teach her about empathy and the power of her soul.As she gets older we plan to incorporate a nightly ritual of reviewing our day. Choosing one thing we did well and one thing wed like to do better tomorrow and sending good intentions into the universe for everyone. Basically prayers but without religion.We also plan to give her exposure to many religions in time. Visiting churches temple mosques etc. Theres a local UU church thats very liberal and humanist they have a great religious ed program that we are considering. They basically do volunteer work outreach discuss the importance of giving and being a good citizen. I want to give her the exposure so she can make educated choices in the future.I feel strongly that I want kiddo raised with faith and spirituality but that it shouldnt be molded around a fallible religion.

She then insisted on going to her room to get changed she lived less than  miles away so why couldnt she wear her special outfit in the car?? Anyway when she finally descended she pushed people who had been waiting nearly an hour out of her choice of seats. Then she developed the worst cough I have ever heard. There was lots of hand waving and half getting up and apologising for this terrible cough which was driving me INSANE it also miraculously got better straight after... She insisted on having photo after photo of her son her son and her her son and his step father her and the step father add in variables of  cousins and an aunty and uncle you can imagine this went on for a while again while everyone else was stood around waiting. Once her son and I split up she became a bigger nightmare and now is banned from seeing the kids which wasnt a decision I wanted to make.My now MIL spent the whole evening reception telling the Vicar how great my husbands ex wife was and how I am sadly lacking in everyway...,breakingmom,cz2xcuo,3,t5_2y6ap

6383876,0,t3_433wrv,Omg this sucks so bad.  Im so sorry. I went through this  years ago when my daughter brought lice home from school. Her hair was almost to her knees when it happened. It took me  months to completely rid her of the lice pretty sure she was getting reinfested by someone at school.Heres how I finally got rid of themFirst washing everything amp going crazy with cleaning your house is almost a waste of time. Its not really necessary as long as youre diligent with everything else. Lice dont live more than  hours off a host. Get everyone in your house and put a fairly thick coat of coconut oil on everyones hair. Use a showercap or toss down an old towel on everyones pillow and leave the coconut oil in overnight. Next with the coconut oil still in the hair do a thorough comb through with the lice comb. Dont even bother with the one that comes with lice kits. Its useless. Invest in either a flea comb or get the terminator nitfree comb. Just google it!.Then after the comb through wash the hair really well to get all the oil out this is important for the next step the oil needs to be goneAfter the hair is clean soak it with a solution of  part Apple cider vinegar and  part water. Note  if the lice has been super bad and kiddo has been scratching there will likely be scratches on the scalp reduce the vinegar solution to  part ACV to  parts water. After  minutes with the vinegar still in the hair do another thorough comb through with the lice comb. The vinegar will dissolve the glue that holds the nits to the hair shaft making it easier to remove. Wash the hair again when youre done. This should get rid of a huge amount of the lice amp nits if not all. I took it a step further and blew dry everyones hair then combed through again. Once that was done I did a daily comb through on everyones hair with the lice comb for the first week then every other day for a week until I stopped finding any live or nits. I continued to do a comb through for about  months  times a week until school let out. Once I had done the coconut oil amp vinegar treatment I used a lice repellant spray daily while the girls were still in school. You can either buy one or make your own with  drops of rosemary amp peppermint essential oils in  cup of distilled water. Shake it well each time and just spritz the hair lightly with it. Lice HATE rosemary amp peppermint. You can use the super cheap essential oils no need to spend the money on the expensive ones. Its time consuming to do it this way but you wont be exposing your family to not very safe pesticides. Not to mention the pesticides used in lice treatments are quickly loosing their effectiveness due to lice becoming more amp more resistant to them. Good luck and Im always happy to answer any questions. ,breakingmom,czfa0wv,23,t5_2y6ap

Yours seems to be in limbo at this time.ProLife in no way shape or form equals you are on board with abortion... that assumption is the worst to make.  You never once said that it would be an option.  And for being  and having a cry fest about you not having one makes him seem like a manchild... I know you love him but come on.  Sex CAN  BABY no matter how careful you are.  At  you should at least realize that as a risk every time you have sex.  You cant hide behind religion on that one.  Him having a complete aversion to your kid lands is just frustrating.  Did he think if the kid spent time with him hed have to start claiming him as his son?  Kinda beside the point right now because now he has been faced with fatherhood and he freaked out.  The ball is in his court now and I cant help but think he will fault and run.  It sucks and it isnt fair to YOU.  Not bringing it up doesnt mean the baby is just going to magically go away and he can go back to doing as he pleases.  It may be time to start protecting yourself and start looking into what you can do so he cant just leave you and cut all ties.

Ever notice that hardly anyone is smiling...especially not the adults? My mother and I were there one day and we legit heard a woman after grabbing her son by the arm tell him if you dont behave Im gonna fuck you up right here. Now I am no sactimommy and have no issues with parents needing to discipline their little monster but to tell them that you are gonna fuck them up at the Happiest Place On Earth just felt wrong. Also...so many god damned strollers just being shoved into people it makes me fear leaving the park. If thats how you drive pushing your child around in front of you I dont want to be anywhere near you when you get behind the wheel of your car o.oMakes me sad...and more resolved that when the childbeast is old enough to appreciate going to Disneyland that its going to be whatever the hell she wants to do.

If he doesnt want to do counseling or he cant follow through you only have two options live with it as it is or leave. Its harsh and I dont mean it meanly but there isnt really much else in between. I do want to note that your emotional wellbeing is just as important as anything else. So he doesnt hit you...so what? Were all taught that physical abuse is the worst and its bad yes but nobody really talks about what its like to be emotionally neglected. Its painful too! OrangeDude once told me that I had to stop falling for guys just because they didnt beat my face in. Theres a set of standards that Im allowed to have and they include being seen as a person. Im not required to love or be with anyone just because they dont hurt my body and especially not because leaving is seen as failing. Sometimes you really just cant work with another person in a relationship. And if youve done everything you can to rebuild but its not working...then its time to go.

She left work and made to the hospital in  minutes when it usually takes her an hour to get home from work. After that she was ecstatic.

So my house is always a comfortable temperature since it keeps the house at an avg temp with all the sensors. And only have it track the bedrooms during sleep.  And for example we had to go out of town on a family emergency obviously remembered when were  hours away just logged in and set to vacation.  On our way back on the drive over I turned the vacation mode off and it was comfortable when we arrived home.ETA Ziploc steam bags  cause I aint got time to clean a pot  strainer for some bit of cauliflower.,breakingmom,d0mfai8,2,t5_2y6ap

Honestly how it works out it is going to depend on how your kids are. We actually have more time together now than we did after our first for nearly the first year. She was a difficult baby this ones an easy one. Its already getting so much better. The little one loves watching the toddler and my toddler is so sweet with the little one. Its really amazing. But I think I have relatively easy kids so its really going to depend.My house is a wreck. Its a struggle to keep it hygienic never mind neat. I think there may be  days worth of food glued to the floor under the high chair right now. Its embarrassing. The daily tasks can be overwhelming. I cant do any housework while my husband is at work so he has really had to step up with pitching in. I have pangs of guilt. I feel like Im missing out on really being present with both kids as individuals. I have had to rock both kids while all three of us cried. Many times. Ive had to tell the toddler that I was doing the best I could which shockingly worked. If you asked me this a month ago I would have recommended a back alley sterilization instead. I dont think Id change it though. Were all happy. Its hard in the beginning I knew it would be and I stressed to no end about it during my pregnancy. But now I think were through the hardest part.I think if you prepare it will go well. Particularly if youve had easy babies before think about what youll do if you have a difficult one. It seems impossible but you manage. We have nearly no free time but we will again when the kids get a little more independent.,breakingmom,d1gkqhj,5,t5_2y6ap

When he entered Kindergarten he was only expected to know the letters associated with his name!  When he finished Kindergarten he knew all his letters.  About this time of year he started coming home with sight words and short reading assignments.  And when I say short I mean  pages with most of the page being a picture and  words on each page.Also there was no real homework for Kindergarten!  Sight words I was encouraged to review with him.......but they went over them at school so I never really bothered.Clearly the work they are requiring is a bit much!!  Also that preschool is not on the same page as the school!!  In my school system yes he would have been properly prepared but your school system has higher standards thats my polite way of saying they are nuts!.Im amazed at schools like this!  How can anyone think its OK to push little kids like this!!  Its not like they have control over whenhow their brains develop!!   year olds are usually just not capable of doing that kind of work!

7269355,0,t3_4evlb8,I think its  totally normal to feel like this and to some extent we all mourn things that will never be however your issues with depression are likely enhancing your feelings and making it worse. I empathize very much with your post because I struggle with a lot of the same emotions. Im a mom via adoption so Ive never carried a child to term delivered a live child or even been able to stay pregnant past  wks. I mourned that a ton before we adopted and even now with our daughter who I am beyond grateful for I still mourn the fact that Ill never know what it feels like to have a baby move inside of you or celebrate a pregnancy instead of waiting for the inevitable end  or even have a baby shower we found out about Bossy  days before she was born and didnt tell anyone about her for fear that it would all fall through My husband didnt see his daughter born or meet her until I brought her back home nearly  weeks later. It hurts a lot to know that Ill never have those moments and the great likelihood is well never be able to afford to adopt again we joke that the credit card companies may repo our daughterlol so I wont get a boy or the  kids I wanted. Every time I see a pregnant lady i struggle between overwhelming sadness and wanting to tell her how lucky she is and that things can go wrong any minute so its really a miracle and not something to be taken lightly....and then I reel in the crazy and just smile and nod instead. Society makes us think that pregnancy is something every woman can do it always ends in sunshine and happiness and kids just happen. Thats not the truth for a lot of us so not only do we grieve what couldve been but we also carry the shameguilt of not being able to do something weve been taught comes easily. Theres yet another subset of guilt for those who finally have a living child after struggles because were made to feel ungrateful for not being happy with the child we have. Our pain is discredited because we have a child or children even if we still long for more. And oh the mommy guilt that comes with that I feel like I can never complain about any aspect of motherhood bc of the hell I went through to get here.I think we all have regrets and sadness and its okay. Like Daniel Tiger says its okay to feel sad sometimes little by little youll feel better again. Be sad but dont let it consume you. Continue to focus on managing your mental health. I wouldnt think about your family in such a finite manner either. You dont know what life will throw at you. When we found out about Bossy we were nearly  years after the stop trying to have babies speech from the doctor I had just graduated law school and we had given up on being parents. I had no clue that a former client would call me up and ask me if Id be interested in adopting a baby from someone she knew no clue that in  days Id be a mom. Life changes quickly.As someone who is being treated for depression and anxiety I can say that its hard to not focus on the sadness and the negatives.Its like it overwhelms you until you cant even appreciate the good in life. For me it helps to think that life is not something set in stone. We may adopt again. We may foster a child later. speaking of fostering may be something you should look into? I cant tell you today that Ill never have another child so I dont think of it like that and it helps me get through. Hugs and best of luck!,breakingmom,d24h514,2,t5_2y6ap

He has had no side effects and its amazing. He failed treatment five years ago with interferon and ribavirin and it was awful. A year of fucking hell. And it didnt work. He got infected in the s from a blood transfusion following surgery to donate a kidney to his brother. It was before they screened blood for anything. He has no complications from the hep c at all and its over  years later. This isnt a death sentence. There are options and treatments that work really well. Also he drinks one or two beers once every week or every other week. Have that glass of wine to calm your nerves if you need it. One glass right now isnt going to be the end of your liver. If you were negative before surgery PLEASE call the hospital and tell them you are coming back positive now.

Things on the diaryDate on top of pageFood section  I wrote down what he ate that day and approx how much.

Approxomate times circumstances was it after a bath? before bed? was he in obvious pain before or after? and I would describe any bowel movements as to color consistency and estimate the quantity.  I wasnt super scientific but its a LOT more information for the doc then just he doesnt poop very often and it seems to hurt.Finally Id put any general notes about our day or his behavior at the bottom  did we have a special trip to the zoo?  Was he extra cranky or extra tired?  That kind of thing.Id schedule an appointment with her ped but in the meantime at least start the diary.

7308179,0,t3_4fh4ij,this is long. Im sorry Hey I get the stigma. I cant talk about this IRL so nobody except my doctors and my husband know that Im medicated.I started Seroquel in December after finally getting a diagnosis of Bipolar Type II. I went through undiagnosed untreated PPD with both of my pregnancies and in September I found out I was pregnant for a rd time. I insisted that I needed help possibly medication beginning during the pregnancy because I knew I would never get myself help after the baby was born. So we got the ball rolling with a psych evaluation and talk therapy. In November we found out we lost the baby to a molar pregnancy but it was a great comfort to know that I was already on the papers to get evaluated and had completed one session of therapy already.The psych has called this interim period where Im not allowed to try again to get pregnant until Im cleared a gift of time where we can try to get a handle on what meds work and how much I need. So we have been gradually increasing my dosage every month to find the absolute lowest dosage that makes me feel normal. Now at mg and I think I want to leave it here for a bit but also hoping to be cleared to TTC with my final blood test in July for watching my hCG. My doctor weighs me every other month at my request and I have a blood panel done every  months to monitor cholesterol etc. since Seroquel can have a negative effect on cholesterol levels. I am unable to stay awake about  hours after taking my meds and I am drowsy upon waking  hours later but as a SAHM with a kiddo who still naps I have the luxury of grabbing a nap later in the day but I dont nap every day and I dont notice crippling fatigue on busynonnap days.I am less rollercoastery and more bumpy road as far as my mood fluctuations. Often I will reflect on the day and know that I was more up or down but it was within normal limits.Therapy is helping me recognize the feelings I get before I snap or have an anxiety attack and we are working through what to do to minimize the impact on my kids. It doesnt hurt that my therapist is helping me work on my negative selftalk that often fuels my moods and she finds ways to trick me into revealing that I am a good person a good mom and I just generally get out all the crap thats flying around in my head. She helps me acknowledge that shit gets hard sometimes. Having gone through talkdrug therapy as a teenager which I didnt find helpful and became noncompliant I can definitely say that the right people on your side is incredibly important.This is all just my own experience and I hope it helps you a little bit. Sometimes its hard for me to talk about online even but shoot me a PM if you want to talk more personally and I will try my absolute hardest to get back to you. lt Im sorry your brain is mixed up.

Id really really love to be able to say that.But the truth is she has grown out of it somewhat. And most days are good. The bad days are really bad but they happen less often now.The trick is figuring out the triggers. For her its being tired. Or feeling out of control. Even at  she has a stricked bed time routein. She hates being told to do anything and she has a short fuse.But shes such a cool kid when shes not losing her shit. I love hanging out with with her and talking with her. Its hard though. Has been her entire life. Its hard not to compare her to her chill older brother. And sometimes I think about leaving her IN Target. Sometimes I just tell my husband I cant deal anymore and lock myself in my room.Sorry if this dosent help much but it gets better when you learn how to avoid the triggers.

7398642,0,t3_4gmhuq,Therapy ASAP. This might be general anxiety but one thing nobody ever looked for in me was OCD. And thats because I have it diagnosed but fairly functional and my anxiety seems to stem from it so far as we can figure out. Im usually OK in every situation that would cause anxiety... As long as my rituals and routines arent thrown off. The minute something is happening at a different general time Im toast. Especially if theres nobody familiar to be with or no activity to perform. The intrusive thoughts used to be so intense when I was younger and if I were by myself Id go into a tailspin. Even now and I have a mild version if things dont go in order it can cause rippling issues. On Friday my shoes werent in my gym bag like normal and the act of me having to put them in caused a panic and then I felt rushed and then took stuff to the car out of order and through that process forgot to send formula with LittleO. Seriously the dumbest crap you can think of. And then even though I gave our daycare provider money for formula I totally beat myself up about it the whole hour to work and then the first two hours there. I know better than that! I know how this works. But if this is what is going on with your kid she has no idea what to do. Things are different. Anything could change at any time! She has to do things differently! She has no friends! Everyone is staring at her! And on and on. Im not saying this is totally what she has but that its worth looking into just in case. And if thats what this is even in part its something you guys can work with. If it is she cant help it and she will need support as she learns how to navigate. It can be really hard on the people who dont have this disorder because theres often no rhyme or reason they can see for why things HAVE to be this way so you guys would need to learn some coping skills too so that you dont burn out either. ,breakingmom,d2j6dfd,1,t5_2y6ap

Leaving her to cry for a little while that worked. I cant talk for  month olds but Id say give it a go.

This person knew I was working long hours and tried to send their friend around as well to play with the dogs to make sure they got enough attention. The weird part was the friend didnt have keys to the house so it had to be while I was there? Which was like my down time after work. So i was expected to have this random person over while I was house sitting to do a better job than me at caring for the dogs. I fobbed them off in the end anyway. The dogs missed their owner and werent as happy as they normally are.. but they were fine. ,breakingmom,d2wwwn8,1,t5_2y6ap

You get a bag of frozen Tyson crispy chicken strips a head of lettuce a bag of shredded cheese of your choice tortillas and ranch dressing I use buttermilk ranch dressing. You take some lettuce and line the center of the tortilla with it. Then you cook some of the chicken strips and put one or two depending on size on top of the lettuce. Take some shredded cheese and put it on the top then however much ranch dressing you like and wrap it up. Theyre good whether the chicken is hot or if the cooked chicken has cooled. Plus it only takes me about  minutes to make. If you wanted to use a different topping other than ranch like honey mustard or something you just switch it out.

If you make a little extra your benefits are cut to the quick and its not worth taking that little raise that seems like a God send otherwise. I also am very hesitant to trust our government to do anything right. I would much rather give my portion currently going to taxes to local or national charities that are helping more successfully than these other government programs and with lower overhead costs. Ive read a lot of these comments and I come from a household that should have been middle class but due to some substance problems was not we had the electric shut off several times. I worked my way out of that hole on my own bootstrap mentallity with no help I get even more irritated when people say you cant do that anymore because its bs and trivializes those who do because its still totally possible. I have skipped lunches because I didnt have the money run bills late and scraped to make sure it got paid and I never took assistance because I felt there were others that needed it more than I did. In many situations with kids its totally necessary a  parent working household without free daycare is virtually impossible unless both have professional jobs. A single income household on the current median salary in many places but definitely not all is not even feasible I am fortunate to be in a reasonably low COL area that is also fairly recession proof so I know in that regard I have more opportunity than others and even the poor where I live are better off than other places but we still have a lot of generational welfare families and its a problem that needs to be dealt with ignoring in my mind is not a valid solution.,breakingmom,d34ql1w,-2,t5_2y6ap

We were high school sweethearts and sure we loved each other but college and hormones took over and we broke up our senior year. The summer of  I met my ex. I was infatuated with him. He was older a DJ seriously...dont giggle and seemed to really care about me. Well as we all know alcohol and birth control dont mix and I ended up pregnant. We shotgunned a wedding and proclaimed that we loved each other and would forever..Forever...yeah... Thats laughable.When we moved into our own home he showed the side of him Id never seen before. Just a monster... He was verbally physically and mentally abusive.. And I was miserable.. During our whole relationship I kept a friendship with my DH. I needed someone to talk to. I needed him to care. Eventually ex found out and blocked his number from my phone....So I cheated with a different friend. He found out we divorced but during the divorce rather than just saying yeah milly cheated I was a whore a prostitute a druggie and alcoholic. None of which were true. I was so depressed I woke up everyday debating rather or not to kill myself. And one day DH showed up on my doorstep to surprise me. he had been out of state for the last year I wasnt expecting him so when I opened the door I was a mess...tears hair everywhere hadnt showered in days...it was bad...Instead of tucking tail and running like I think he should have he hugged me. Oh my god. It felt like home. So I cried harder.... He walked me to the bathroom and washed my hair for me as I sat in the bottom of the shower crying then he cooked the most amazing seafood Alfredo then he just held me. He held me all night. I knew I was suppose to be with him. We got married  months after we started dating again  and just this past January welcomed another girl to our mix. Were a happy little family now. And while I feel bad that I basically emotionally cheated on my ex with DH it opened the door to actually cheating my divorce and all of that lead me back to DH. Im not advocating for cheating or running away with a new guy. There are still times that I wish me and ex had worked our only for my oldest girl or times that I wish I had never met him. Youll always have what ifs in life. Thats just a fact. Just dont put your happiness on the back burner. Or as my DH likes to say dont set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

Some kids are more physical than others which is probably the only reason your son is getting the brunt of it. But they are very little and neither is reading into it some sort of bullying situation like older kids. What can you do about the other kid? Nothing just like his parents cant really hes way too young and is just doing stuff for doing stuff. You can tell reinforce to your son that it was not OK that he got hurt and that people need to be gentle with each other but I dont really see what else there would be. Is your problem then more with the parents reaction? Maybe their son interacts with a lot of other kids and so its just kind of normal for this stuff to happen. Like I said I have two toddlers and I can respond appropriately every time but there they go again pulling each other down on the tile floor by the neck... You cant really expect them to even understand why they shouldnt do that until they are like minimum  and even then they will still do it.

7971010,0,t3_4oexra,We just moved out of state and my daughter will be two in August. We were fortunate to have quite a bit of over lap where we owned both houses so I moved half of her toys to the new house for her to play with while we cleaned and moved some stuff in. Whenever we would be at the new house we would talk about how we were going to live there and whenever we were at the old house we would talk about packing all of our things and taking them to the new house. We also knew the people buying our old house so we would talk about how her room was going to be Alden and Islas room soon etc. I dont know if she ever got any of it but the move hasnt phased her in the slightest. She adjusted to the new house in about two days and is perfectly comfortable here. Ive never lived with my in laws but they are next door to our new hours next door in a rural sort of way...theyre probably a good yds away. It was really handy those first few days before we had really gotten groceries or had our internet hooked up. Its been pretty nice to be able to have them take her for an hour here and there so I can do some packing uninterrupted. My MIL stopped over kind of randomly this morning because it had been a few days since she saw kiddo and she read her books while I showered and got ready.

Wasnt saying mum or dad though and no emotional type language or conversational language. He understood what we said however.He started speech in oct last year and in combo with his therapist and pediatrician we got a high functioning autism diagnosis in Jan at about . years.We are in Australia so an official diagnosis ment that we could access funding  to use before he turns  that now goes towards paying for speech and any developmental aids he needs. He is also getting occupational therapy now for free through Early Intervention and the funding pays for things like an exercise ball etc for the stuff we have to do at home with him. We might get a trampoline at some point too.I dont know about your kid but Will is super clumsy and not very aware of the space and things around him. Partly because he is so focused on what he is doing and partly because he just doesnt care. Hopefully the OT will help with this as much as the speech has helped his speech. I also am now getting a payment of about  every  weeks as a carers payment which is good although i feel a bit guilty about that coz he is my kid and he doesnt really need that much extra attention.He has been going to a daycare  day a week since he was months and I think that has helped a heap too. We are pretty introverted parents and all our family live at least  hours away so no baby sitting or popping round for chats etc.Sorry if im boring you talking about my kid.

8014011,0,t3_4ozlcs,OK Im going to give you some background as to where I am coming from with my thoughts on what I would do in this situation I really cant give you advice on how you are handling this and feeling this because honestly each person grieves in their own way and YOUR FEELINGS ARE VALID. I lost my first child at  weeks. I understand what it is to lose a loved and very wanted child and have to deliver them stillborn. How insufficient that makes you feel as a person and mother. How it hurts to say a childs name but hurts to not say a childs name at the same time. Is the middle name a family name? If so if I were you and please see my caveat above about grieving and being allowed to feel how you feel I would try and drop it. It hurts that your childs name is the same as the middle name chosen but its not the childs first name. If the name is just a name they liked yes I would probably be upset more than if it were a family name or name of significance but I still would just let them know it upset me and leave it at that. A middle name isnt a first name you wont have to hear it every day.Listen every day you are going to find things that upset you about this because IT SUCKS THAT YOU LOST A CHILD. I know several people whose children have the same name that my first child has. It hurts EVERY time I hear those names but that doesnt mean that they have any less rights to that name than I had. It will never not hurt even if I dont hear a childs name that is the same as my firstborn son. What is extra hurtful about this is that they are your family and they are not understanding the importance of your loss. That is what I would feel more upset about that they dont seem to place any importance on your feelings. But the thing with such personal losses like this is that no one ever really understands it unless they have gone through it so you are going to live your life around people who dont really get it. Youll get used to people trivializing it it always sucks but its one of those things that people just wont understand until they have gone through. So I guess what Im saying is that its okay to feel angry at them for this and sad and whatever else you are feeling. But try not to let it eat you alive. And dont for a minute think that the middle name is stolen from you. Its a name. You have every right to use that name as a middle name for your next child even if they are using it. ,breakingmom,d4gul9k,6,t5_2y6ap

8100325,0,t3_4q3y6h,So in many ways the family dynamic with my husband is lopsided. He works and Im currently a SAHM though currently looking for a job because its driving me batty but thats a different issue. Even so I often times feel that I do an unfair amount of work. Im up before he is I finish after he comes home and I do the vast majority of the housework. I know perfectly well that after I get a job Ill have to do similar amounts of houseworkchildcare.BUT theres a reason for it thats not my husband is lazy and entitled. He has legit medical problems that make movement difficult. I put the kid to bed because he physically cant carry the munchkin upstairs and put him in his crib. Hell do things like load the dishwasher and need to spend half an hour or more recovering. So when we go out I have to corral the kid because he cant catch or carry a running toddler I have to do the grocery shopping because sometimes lifting the food is too painful I have to take out the trash because its too hard on him etc. etc. Its frustrating as hell for both of us. But hes aware of how much work I do and is incredibly grateful for it. He never complains if the house is a mess hes thoughtful about gifts and trying to make me feel special and would probably tell your dude to man the fuck up and refill the goddamn soap dispenser. So I would say that a relationship can be lopsided in some ways if and only if both partners are adults about it and really try to appreciate what the other does. As frustrating as it gets sometimes I know my husband is in real pain and while its unfair that I do as much work as I do its more unfair to ask him to injure himself. Plus some days he has bad days and can barely walk. How can I ask someone who needs a cane to get around to do the laundry? In return my husband tries really hard to make me feel special and is vocally grateful for what I do plus he does basically all of the nonphysical work in the house getting bills paid and that sort of thing.All that said sometime I do still want to break his damn phone. ,breakingmom,d4qjsim,3,t5_2y6ap
8103518,0,t1_d4ql0mr,Whatevers going on this isnt a good sign. When someone has you in a place where you are afraid to contact them believing that any attempt at communication even with the best of intentions would ruin whatever is left... Outside of a restraining order if theyve successfully gotten you to believe that contacting them in any way would be doing something wrong? That is redflag territory even under circumstances such as these. Dressing it up with diplomatic language e.g. boundaries doesnt make it any less unreasonable. Ive been following your posts from way back and even with all the bs hes thrown at you or you at each other something still doesnt add up with these recent developments.There is no justifiable need for an emotionallystable person to place a moratorium on innocuous communication with someone they intend to resume communications at some later date. Especially when its their wife and mother of their child! It sounds as though his erratic motivations have you naturally feeling insecure confused and trying to jump through hoops that dont make any observable sense. That tells me there is part of the picture you are missing. Again barring some psychological disturbance people dont act irrationally they act in their best interest. Despite what resentment may lay between you it isnt in his best interest to arbitrarily alienate frustrate and punish you with these unnecessarily draconian restrictions. There is some rational reason for his whims and conditions but he is not sharing it with you.,breakingmom,d4qwpq1,2,t5_2y6ap

8396828,0,t3_4ujxuc,My husband and I have a very strict honesty policy between us its very seriously the foundation of our relationship and how weve managed to stay together for so long and through so much over a decade began as high school sweethearts.And yet... even we have a grace period clause. The way I see it I understand fear. I understand the kneejerk reaction to selfpreservation and the fear of not being able to recover from that shouldnt be something that stands in the way of honesty. Its too precious we both consider a relationship essentially meaningless without transparency.I could easily forgive him for needing some time within reason to collect himself and try again. Weve even had conversations where weve paused and offered a secondtry when we suspect the other hasnt been totally and immediately forthcoming. Sometimes telling the truth is hard its scary and those feelings can get the best of us when we love someone so much that we fear their reaction we fear damaging the thing most precious to us. Anyway my point is I think your husband is being WAY too hard on you. You told him the truth because you love him and honestly is obviously important to you. I feel like he should be glad relieved even to know that transparency between you means so much to you that you told him the truth even though it also meant admitting to lying on top of it when you didnt have to. Thats a rare thing something many of even the happiest couples dont have going for them most Id say. Holding you to a standard that defies human nature just seems unnecessary and unreasonable to me. IMO that too isnt worth sabotaging the most precious thing in your lives any more than lying is. The honesty is what matters with good reason but immediacy? That...really doesnt inherently affect anything beyond what you choose to let it.I dont think its enough to diminish the value of your relationship or yourself for that matter because you told the whole truth imperfectly. Hopefully hell realize that... after taking a little time himself.,breakingmom,d5r5fgz,4,t5_2y6ap

If you want an epidural order it when you get your water broken or even before would be great lol. It was scary for a while with my first because his heartrate was going down and was just above where they do a c section for quite a while. But it turned out fine. My nurses were amazing. I didnt want an epidural that time and they were supportive while also getting things ready so if I changed my mind it could happen in like  minutes when they saw I was having a hard time.

I sent my oldest kid to preschool starting at age  kindergarten starts at age .  A lot of schools now are jumping kindergarten kids right into lots of work and tons of homework right away.  Homework for a kid that small is crazy to me but it is what it is.  So he had a lot of skill already learning days of the week numbers the alphabet etc.  As well as how to sit still when a teacher is talking how to listen while in a group how to deal with other kids and conflict.  I felt that preschool was invaluable for my kid because at the time he was an only child.  He knew his alphabet and numbers before preschool but the act of just being in class was a very important thing to learn prekindergarten. ,breakingmom,d5tgs7y,3,t5_2y6ap

8464306,0,t3_4vm3j3,Contact a lawyer NOW. Save any texts emails or other communications in which they are threatening to take your kid from you. Their understanding of the law is flawed. They cannot take your kid from you just because you were a SAHM for most of your kids life. If the father is unwilling to fight for custody they have even less grounds. Im fairly certain the only way they could take your kid away from you is if they have prove you have been abusive or negligent. Grandparents dont really have custody rights and they CERTAINLY dont have greater custody rights than the parents so no matter how much money and support theyve given you they cant take away your rights to your child.That said they CAN be a giant pain in the ass. They can make things drag out longer be more contentious and more expensive. Given that your soon to be ex is the father and has been acting as the father i.e. youve been living together and I presume he can argue that hes played a paternal role to the kid I dont think the courts are going to care all that much that he isnt on the birth certificate. Going over a state line can complicate things how far away from your husband are you planning on going? If its a  minute drive it may not be that big of a deal but a  hour one may be harder to justify to a court. Also I am not a lawyer and dont know family law in either of those states...but a real lawyer can help with those kinds of decisions. You dont want to be accused of parental kidnapping or something.Would it be possible to get your ex to tell his parents to settle down? I have no idea what hes like but maybe if HE told his dad to chill out it would result in fewer headaches for everyone. Which in all honesty is true. If grandpa gets too aggressive he can make it harder for his son to get visitation particularly if they live together. Plus dad may not want to deal with the cost headache and heartache that is a contentious family court case. ,breakingmom,d5zkpk0,6,t5_2y6ap

My mom never wanted anything but the best for me and never knew which ones were really bad until I was much older.

I ended up not doing it. I stayed at home or worked opposite shifts until they got into school. Im at home with my youngest again because medical daycare is expensive and the only one around has terrible reviews. Like Im unsure why theyre still open terrible. But! My BFF sends her little one to a great daycare. She learns a lot has little friends is always clean and happy at the end of the day. Theyre so happy with their daycare.  What is my point? Oh.

8883452,0,t1_d7fn8qw,This is what were stuck doing. We do not have the means or intent to purchase and insure another vehicle and honestly I wouldnt get use out of it. My husband works a minute drive away from home and its no problem to drive him tofrom work every day if I wanted to though sometimes he arranges to go out for business lunch but theres always someone else he can carpool with. There is absolutely no reason for me to not have a vehicle at my disposal other than the fact that everything is within walking distance. Except doctors offices because my family doc moved and OBpsych is located downtown. I walk my daughter to school can walk to the grocery storedrugstore if I need to pick something up... we chose this house based on a variety of factors. There is public transit available. I both admire and appreciate my husbands hard work and apologize every day for the fact that he is cleaning up after me... he knows the first trimester is due to end soon and Ill be a little more back to normal. Why Im close to calling him unreasonable is because in the past that would be two successful pregnancies and more recently a loss that required a lot of followup its been no trouble to go in late or leave early. He pretty much makes his own hours which is why his boss is able to be so flexible. Just get the work done come in when you can leave when you need to. With the exception of meetings many of which he hosts and can reschedule he has a bit of wiggle room at the beginningend of his business day. This has historically been when I try to schedule appointments so that it disrupts his day as little as possible.Like you and anyone else who operates off one income we try to watch what we spend. If it was something like a specialist a couple of hours away I would be more inclined to interview and hire sitters. But these appointments are all in town.

9018657,0,t3_53r1p8,Focus. What is important is you your husband and your children. Your mom is an adult and responsible for her own shit. You know the stuff about giving your children the childhood you never had? The strange thing is that you are actually recreating your childhood right down to enmeshing their lives with your mother. This is super common in children who grew up in abusive homes and yours certainly sounds like it was at least very mentally and emotionally abusive. You say you want to teach your children that they arent responsible for an adults happiness but they will learn according to what you DO not what you say. And what they see you doing is making yourself and them very unhappy because you still feel obligated to be the emotional and financial food source for your mother.You are sacrificing the stability and happiness of yourself and your children trying to take care of everyone else. You need to start being emotionally and financially frugal. You only have so much and you your husband and your children deserve it all. The rest are adults and you need to cut them off. At this point they have no reason or motivation to change because they can always take advantage of you and they know it. So please make an escape plan with your husband and get out by any means necessary. You do not and should not consider your mothers opinion at all in this matter its not her life. Do the right thing by your children and get them far away from this toxic environment. Go build a quiet happy life somewhere else. Its the only way youll break this cycle. Otherwise in  years youll see your children right where you are now. ,breakingmom,d7vwgrg,3,t5_2y6ap

Mention it to other parents to try and gauge reaction but Id expect them to kind of roll their eyes at the crazy evangelicals but then just move on.

Now that were settled in I can say with confidence that we would absolutely do it again. We never had access to a reliable babysitter in our old town and both of our moms are so helpful now. We havent really made friends here yet all of our old friends from growing up here have moved away but I think that will come more naturally when we have schoolaged kids. As far as families in different locations are concerned I can say that BILs experience has been that its better to NOT try to live somewhere inbetween. When you do that you always have to make a call on who is going to get your limited vacation time and holidays. Its much easier to live near one side of the family and see them regularly but travel to the other for extended stays.

9280362,0,t3_57iuoj,My husband did the patch and sucked on hard candy. He kept with the patches for about  weeks then kept forgetting to replace it each day so he just stopped wearing them but kept the candy. He said the candy replaced the oral fixation. There were many days that he wanted to kill us all but he did pretty well with not snapping at us. The biggest thing is to not smoke while wearing the patch. It could make you sick but also if it doesnt make you sick then it seems like a waste to wear it then you give up and go back to smoking. He does have one here or there like when he is out with the guys but he limits it to one and that is only maybe once a month. He still has to have hard candy on long car trips bc the urge is strong in the car. He has been smoke free for a year except got the odd one mentioned above. Edit to add he tried for several years to quit and he tried cigars pipes vaping nicotine gum lozenges and slowly quitting. He said these were the worst bc he was still doing it so it was so easy just to slip back into it. ,breakingmom,d8scpil,2,t5_2y6ap

Youll want to grab fast passes in the morning to ride things in the afternoon. Haunted Mansion had a  minute wait on Sunday for standard groups. Some rides have single rider lines.Also you can get free cups of water from the walk up restaraunts if you just ask.

But I read an article today about a woman who got a lateterm abortion. At  weeks I think it was?  Her fetus was nonviable horribly deformed incapable of breathing on its own would die shortly after being born not discovered until very late in the game obviously. It seems like the only difference was instead of waiting for birth naturally or inducing and letting the baby die outside the womb they administered an injection to stop the babys heart and then she was induced. So sparing the baby those few minutes hours days of pain in the world before death. So yeah I learned that today. Its the shot that stops the babys heart in the womb instead of waiting for it to die naturally after birth that makes it an abortion. But like others point out she still had to go through the birth. Its impossible not to at that point. ,breakingmom,d917nwp,9,t5_2y6ap

As a feminist I dont want ANYONE to be told they cant be who they are inside. As long as you arent hurting anyone I dont care and neither should anyone else.   Politically I think if Trump doesnt do a shitton of damage to the country Pence and his cadre will. Womens rights LGBTQ rights and a host of other minorities will become even more second class citizens. Corporations will ride roughshod over the economy more than they already do and there will likely be an exodus of some of our most capableambitious citizens as they flee the country. ,breakingmom,d9j6nnf,9,t5_2y6ap

This will give you some time to decompress from work and to start dinner. It also establishes good study habits for them. I started this when oldest was . years old and did it thru graduation.

He has agreed to counseling. That is so important. Communication is everything.Sleep deprivation is no joke. You both are not yourselves right now. I know it may not seem like it since you do all the night duties but he is probably just tired and not used to it. All it takes is  less hour of sleep for my BF and he gets grumpy. But now that being tired is his new normal we are doing much better. I dont like it and it definitely doesnt feel fair Ive been up for three hours and its  am but it is what it is. We are  months PP and Id say he calmed down a lot by  months. What really helped me was just streamlining as much as possible. We were both so on edge in the early months from sleep deprivation to be honest we still are so just removing anything that could be a trigger for a stupid comment or a dumb fight was so helpful. Meal prepping a ton of meals at one time and being able to throw one into the crockpot in the morning and not have to worry about dinner. Clean smart not often. Doing one thing special for my BF a week. That way when hes grumpy because we havent been able to spend a lot of time together and the baby is so needy I can say youre right and I know we arent getting the time that we need but I wanted to show you I care so I made some of your favorite snacks. Doing something for him also helped to remind me that I love him. It sounds silly but there will be points where you have to remind yourself and you have to be a team even when you are mad at each other. I guess the biggest thing Id say is to try to be positive. I got into a terrible cycle feeling negative and sorry for myself and I made way too much work on myself when I first became a stay at home mom and my PPD got out of control. It was hell.

10352752,0,t1_dch734v,Yeah I definitely see people acting shitty about sleep training and formula and cloth diapers and electronic toys and screen time none of which I conform to the granola mom standards with and the whole mommy martyr thing is too much. I guess it seemed to me that your post was presented differently than the others less this is the bullshit Im sick of and more these attachment parent idiots are objectively wrong and lazy. I think its ironic that you said that this type of parent makes these choices because theyre too lazy to parent when a sanctimonious granola mom would say the same thing about formula and sleep training. To be clear I dont think that those things are wrong or lazy at all.I think cosleeping probably depends on both the parent and child. My husband and I have always been cuddly sleepers and we both like cuddling with our son at night. Having him in the bed doesnt disrupt my sleep. If I needed space to sleep I definitely would have sleep trained him early on because you have to sleep! And Ive heard tell of babies who like their space which is something I cant even begin to imagine because I have birth to a barnacle. I also really like breastfeeding Im glad it went relatively smoothly for me at the beginning and I have been able to do it for as long as I have.But I definitely agree that none of this stuff that people get crazy about is going to make or break our kids. Hell my son has allergies and asthma and is constantly sick from daycare germs despite the breastfeeding.

10641050,0,t1_dddg8hm,The thing about grief is the only healing is through time. Theres nothing you can do or say to her to make it easier she just has to walk the road. Its actually the same for adults but we talk more about it to process. Think of your own pain nothing anyone can say to you will make the pain go away. I work with pets. When a pet dies the other pets go through a grieving process. We tell the owners to try and just be there for the surviving pets. Take them for extra walks give extra cuddles etc. Over time the neediness of the surviving pet will lessen and theyll start feeling like themselves again. I feel like this advice kind of applies to your daughter too.Im sorry for your loss ,breakingmom,dddjjyq,8,t5_2y6ap

10649794,0,t3_5sdd5c,We live in a stacked duplex two twostory units on top of one another and we got a noise complaint a few months ago.  These were the same neighbors who moved in and were nailing things into the wall at pm waking my kid up every  second.  They must have slipped a note under ther door after  which is when we go to bed since it was there at  when I got up.  Basically it said youre waking us up very early in the morning with noises and you should get a rug.So I responded that we have a toddler who gets up at  and we all wish it was later pointed out that on weekends we get out of the house in the mornings and go to the park that we dont wear shoes in the house and that our bedrooms are upstairs so theyre not even getting the REALLY early stuff.  I also told them that the toddler was just learning to walk and that it would improve as time went on.  I did not offer to do a single damn thing but we are making sure he doesnt drop his cup a lot and this has improved and try to keep him quiet before am on weekdays and am on weekends.  I havent heard from them since.Its somethign a lot of people go through.  Our next door neighbors had a baby and got a complaint from their downstairs neighbors saying that their getting up at am was not conducive to the lifestyle in this neighborhood we live in the city and that they expected quiet before noon on the weekends.  We all laughed really hard.Youre in an apartment.  People have families.  People have different schedules.

So they just stopped driving me places.  It was public transportation which I generally didnt mind or my friends but rarely my parents themselves.  Since you dont really have public transportation if you stop driving them you will be forcing your kids to drive.  Driving them still just enables them to not drive.

Some apartments will require proof of employment and an offer letter will work  this is not going to be unusual for employers.Call up whoever holds your medical debt and ask to be put on a payment plan for  a month or something that is affordable.  Itll keep them from pursuing you and youll be giving them something so its a winwin.You should get a credit card.  You build up credit by running up a balance and then repaying it  basically showing that you can be trusted to borrow money and pay it back on time.  All you have to do is put on an amount that you can repay  for example put groceries on it then pay it down.  I wouldnt roll your medical debt onto it just yet.Your mom is not being consistent.

My son had an incident several years ago where another parent was literally screaming in his face son goes to breakfast so neither of us was present for lining up for classes but other parents were and this was part of how we helped him deal with it.  We also gave copies to the school so it would be on file and they would know exactly what effect was had on my son.  School didnt call us either.  Livid is an understatement.Next take some time to write out what you want to say or make them aware of.  Just notes really that you can mark their responses to and pull together into a letter if you need to to send to the school board.  They may not have a policy for this situation so input might actually help them come up with a plan for drivers and students in bus emergencies.Im sure theres more stuff and more reasons but Im afraid my tablet is going to boot me again so my last thought is lots of hugs and a relaxing weekend for her and you.  ,breakingmom,ddw05tr,36,t5_2y6ap

10989139,0,t1_dedkcdd,This happened back in August  no one got charged with anything.  To be honest my son was so relieved to get his daughter back that night it was all he was focused on.  He actually had to have a state cop go with him to retrieve her.   He didnt even think to have the guard charged with impersonation.CPS in her state was absolutely NOT going to let her mother keep her which is why they told my son that if he didnt pick her up from the hospital she was going into foster care.  My son discontinued her visitation after all that bullshit he had sole custody at the time through a CPS ruling.  Unfortunately since then in October a family court judge gave her back unsupervised visitation time every other weekend and gave her joint legal custody... because her boyfriend started a drug treatment program and was testing negative for everything except alcohol which is his new drug of choice.  Even the false accusation and crazy behavior wasnt enough for the judge to not give her visitation back.  Its crazy making!It definitely is psychological and in my opinion sexual abuse by her mother and maternal grandmother.  My son had her in therapy to deal with everything and she is adjusting well  the therapist actually released her from therapy just recently. I would love to sue them for slander but it costs thousands to hire a lawyer for it and according to an off the record chat with his custody lawyer we would have to prove that they cost us incomemoney in order to actually win a judgment against them.

There was a big container with three different sizes just outside the NICU and we just took what we needed from it. That way the hospital knew they were sterile I think. After a while when he started eating by bottle rather than just NG tube they asked that we bring in a regular bottle that wed be using at home and they sterllized it and used it for feeding him but I still pumped into the bottles they provided. Id just stick them in the fridge then bring a days worth with me at once. Theyd freeze it and prepare what he needed for the day. When he left they gave me back all the extra and it filled a huge shopping bag! Apparently my output was just fine.

He also likes knowing if he needs me to bring him something or go pick him up for some reason he wont have to worry about giving me directions or figuring out an address because I can find him and if he is ever in an accident the app will alert emergency services for him.  I like the added accountability that comes with the driver package that helps instill good driving habits now while he is still gaining critical experience and adds a layer of protection if hes ever in an accident.

11495830,0,t3_642k6y,Here have the whole exchange so you can see what I put up with. This is what I went with ME The kids have been coming home extremely hungry on Sundays and telling me that they are not being fed appropriately during your visits. A single four piece nugget is not enough for a full meal for growing children nor are French Fries and water. If you are unsure what to feed them I can gladly provide a chart from their pediatrician or give you examples of what an average meal consists of but if you recall you are responsible for lunch on Sundays not merely a snack. If you are financially unable to provide a full meal please notify me in writing so that I can make sure they are fed appropriately prior to your visitations. Thank you. HIM I have them from  to  no where does it say i have to feed them a lunch or dinner but i feed them all the time because oldest son has told me you dont feed them alot and i make sure they have enough to eat and i dont feel this message is right for you to be attacking meME You were told by the referee when you were granted visitation that you are responsible for lunch on Sunday. I am in no way attacking you simply attempting to make sure that your end of the bargain is fulfilled. The kids are fed plenty at home youngest child is up  pounds since last May and middle child weighs nearly  pounds. oldest child gets lunch and breakfast at school so I cannot attest to his eating habits there although his teachers say he eats just fine. Do you need me to provide you with resources outlining a proper lunch for the kids or are you capable of finding those on your own? HIM I know how to feed my kids and i was not told by anyone that i had to feed them i get them after lunch time and i drop them off before dinner and i do feed them when i have them they have plenty of food and i dont have to do any thing that is not on paper by law so i ask that u refrain from contacting me by any means from now on if this acttacking my parenting skillsME The childrens lunchtime on Sundays is  p.m. this was established in front of the referee and it was determined that you would feed them lunch because of the time you receive them. I will be sure to ask our judge on the th to include this in the court order. It is ordered that we maintain a line of communication for parenting and visitation issues such as this one and until further notice of the courts I will continue to attempt to keep open communication with you. If you feel that I am attacking you by all means feel free to file a motion but this is part of coparenting. HIM It is not co parenting when u tell me on a friday  days after i had them there is a issue with the way i do my parenting this is not communication i will not respond if you cant be civilME It is coparenting where both parents discuss an issue and try to come to a solution without the courts becoming involved and I figured bringing it up now  days before the next visit would be more effective than on a Sunday  days before the next visit. I am being perfectly civil with you I am sorry if you feel differently. My goal was not to attack you but to have a productive discussion regarding what the responsibilities of each party in this case are. HIM I have asked you to stop contacting me and if you refuse i will contact the courts and police for harassment bc thats what you are doingALSO HIM It will be handed by the courtsME Does that mean you will be foregoing parenting time or are we still meeting on Sunday?See what I fucking put up with? This is the exact reason we were ordered to communicate via email...regarding parenting time and visitation so that we could attempt to co parent and not end up in court every few days. ,breakingmom,dfz1v82,18,t5_2y6ap

Im sorry you have to go through this.A couple years ago when I first went back to work the first kitchen I was ever assigned to on a permanent meaning I worked there all the time and didnt travel around to different kitchens basis I was bullied.I was the youngest one there by several years. One of my coworkers was an older like  something black lady who spent the entire shift criticizing my work. Like I dont know how she got any of the things she was supposed to do done because she was constantly on my ass telling me I wasnt doing things right. Mostly because I was getting things done but not in the same way SHE would have done them.One day just out of the blue she asked me how I cleaned my house and I explained that I used either soapwater or vinegarwater except in the bathroom where I used a bleachwater solution. She told me my house HAD to be filthy dirty because I wasnt bleaching everything to death every day all the time. o.OOne day during a break she and the mgr were discussing an episode of Empire which is one of my favorite shows. When I tried to join in I was told I shouldnt watch that show. Because its a black person show and I wouldnt understandempathize with the characters. I was also told at one point that I shouldnt listen to black people music after saying that I thought Michael Jackson was cool. We had a radio in the back and theyd just played Beat It or something.When we would do periodic deep cleans usually before a long holiday break I would go out of my way to spend an inordinate amount of time cleaning a spot on the floor by the cash registers or something in order to hide from Older Black Lady because she would criticize the way I cleaned so much.At one point towards the end of the school year we were sitting down to lunch we all sat down together and Mgr said If any yall have any problems with anybody else you need to say it right here right now. I told her Id rather speak to her in private later but she insisted. So I let Older Black Lady have it. I told her she was a bitch and a bully and I was sick of being picked on. OBL tried to say Well its ONLY constructive criticism.Bullshit. It was not.Mgr ended up getting back at me for criticizing her pet employee by giving me extra tasks the rest of the year including cleaning the walls for two straight days the last week of school while she and the other two employees OBL and BigMama an older white lady sat on their butts doing nothing. ,breakingmom,dgie2lz,2,t5_2y6ap

11785909,0,t1_dgvxuql,Same here. We fostered two cats for the shelter and then bottle fed kittens. The two foster cat experiences went very badly. Mrs Buttons had weaned her kittens and needed a place to dry up her milk before she could get spayed and had a cold. I did her breathing treatments and she was a great cat! Till she started to feel better. Then she wailed day and night for the next  weeks and began to pee on everything she possibly could. She had been using the box while sick just fine. Nope she was protesting being locked inside so she decided to pee on my daughters back pack daily!Then the kittens were great. I misunderstood the situation so it was my fault but I volunteered to do the bottle feeding which is a huge chore and a big help bc less volunteers want to or are able to do it. Well that was not the agreement according to them. I was to keep all  kittens until they could be fixed at lbs. Well when you have carpet and  brand new kittens with no mom they have no concept of a litter box. They peed everywhere. When they start eating food its a huge mess too so its way more of a disaster than just bottle feeding. They have no concept of eating so they just dump their whole face in the plate and walk all over the food creating lots of cleaning up for lots of meal times per day. The last thing I didnt realize about taking the kittens was that we as volunteers were expected to provide all the materials. Ive fostered before and everything was provided through donations they receive. Not here I guess. Formula was  bucks a can and lasted  days for  kittens. Then when I picked up they asked if I had a heating pad. I said I wasnt sure. Oh dont worry we sell them here. That was . I kind of thought they would loan me one as a volunteer. Oh you need bottles too so that was more money. I said okay what about formula. Oh just pick that up at petsmart. It ended up costing a few hundred dollars said and done. It was fun and I fell in love with the kittens. Mrs buttons was a nightmare. I took her back the day she was eligible to be spayed. They tried to guilt trip me into keeping her too. i was like nope I will not be back to pick her up. I would do just the bottle feeding of kittens if I were allowed to just keep them till they get messy and they provided the materials. They couldve at least mentioned the cost ahead of time to take on. I had the time to volunteer but didnt expect to basically be donating  dollars at the same time. They sent me long emails about the responsibility of feeding every couple hours keeping them warm etc. No mention that every  days they would need a giant can of formula that costs  bucks,breakingmom,dgvyzze,5,t5_2y6ap

Youre brown. Youre light brown. We go to a super mixed race church. That should be hilariously entertaining. Fortunately I cant imagine anyone at our church being offended by it but the resultant laughter may inadvertently encourage more of that line of dialogue. Sigh.,breakingmom,dgwygzr,6,t5_2y6ap

Asking nicely presenting reason and logic crying bribery etc etc etc. My bathroom is forever covered in a humid layer of condensation and I want to throw myself into the god damn lake.,breakingmom,dgxidea,6,t5_2y6ap

11804565,0,t3_68f1zc,My only kid so far was like yours. She would wake up and talk to herself till i got up at a normal time. She didnt seem to mind the alone time so I guess I shouldve never felt guilty even though I always did. I did a later bedtime though of pm to give me a better chance to sleep later. I cant remember when I stopped feeding through the night but I know it was before  months. I did have a hard time with long naps too which kind of made the later bedtime necessary. Nothing I can think of to help. Sorry! ,breakingmom,dgy36vc,1,t5_2y6ap
