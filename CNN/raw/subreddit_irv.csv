4840755,0,t3_3h54x9,Im upvoting because its in this sub and I want to keep the sub alive but I am completely unconvinced by the arguments made. Allowing more than three choices is a huge part of the point for me. For me my first choice is Pirate Party my second choice is Green my third choice is socialist and perhaps my fourth choice is the democrats. Maybe Ill throw in Republicans for  to keep the libertarians NSDAP and objectivists out. Restricting me to three takes away a choice that I would absolutely otherwise make.Acting like printing new ballots is some cosmic inconvenience for restoring democracy is laughable. We have new ballots every election anyways. Certainly making their vote count requires people to educate themselves. We shouldnt act like thats a change nor should we act as if should it be that its a change for the worse.Also ties are easy to handle in software which is how the election should be tabulated in all cases anyways. If two candidates tie check if its the final iteration of the algorithm that is check whether there at least two candidates left that arent either of them. If there are run them both off in one iteration. If there are not there are either  or  politicians or refenda options with more votes. In the case of  leave it to local law. The local law I would support would be to default against incumbency or caucus.If there is  politician with more votes than those two that are tied refer to simple majority of the leading options runoff votes. Say the leading candidate at this point has  of the vote and  say their second choice is B and  say their second choice is C. B wins the tied iteration and C is run off for the final iteration which is processed normally. although of course it doesnt end in the same way as previous iterations because at the final iteration all second preferences which can only be the opposites of first preferences on those ballots or null can only be discardedSo many objections to new ideas are just rhetorical implementation questions that actually have technical answers. Dude handling this corner case is like ten more lines of python. Its not exactly insurmountable. Edit After further research I think Im going to have to say Ive gotta go with Schulze. Its slightly more difficult to understand but actually pretty genius.,irv,cu4pquq,1,t5_2s685
