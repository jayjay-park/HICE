2059,0,t3_1u4xwz,I have read that Massashi Kishimoto has thought of making Sasuke hokage for a long time and i see many problems with this idea. I think that it could have worked if he didnt try to make Sasuke so evil before he talked to the first hokage. In the series he tried to kill his old friends stabbed a new friend one attempted to murder the five kage murdered the acting hokage vowed to destroy the hidden leaf and attempted to kidnap killer bee. Even if he has changed i feel that Kishimoto made Sasuke go too far in fact Sasukes actions in the manga made me thing he was going to only realize his errors before he died. My other problem is with Naruto not becoming the hokage. Naruto has become too powerful and too liked for him not to become hokage. I feel as though the only thing that would keep him from being hokage would be death but if he died i would be very disappointed in Kishimoto.,Naruto,ceeo89r,2,t5_2quts

14181,0,t1_cefzuqb,gt Hiruzen said himself I entrusted Danzo with the seedier side of the village. First why would there be a seedier side of the village to begin with? That alone is bad governing. TIL Every superpower is a case study in bad governing. Danzo ran the Narutoverses version of the SIS CIA RAW SVR or Mossad. What youre saying is ridiculous because every country has their shadier side from the recent revelations about PRISM in the USA to the suspected bombings that Vladimir Putin was complicit if not instigator in early in his political career and even in India where Narendra Modi who is slated to be the next PM has been accused with good reason of complicity in the death of  Muslims and displacement of  more during riots as head of Gujarat. Yet these countries are by no means failed states. They are GNP leaders social leaders and regional if not global powers. gtDanzo was trusted as a Hokage the same way each Kage trusted each other not very much.Earlier Kage were more trusted and A had a certain amount of respect for Minato. Not so much with Danzo. For good reason but then that means that the trustrespect of Danzos office was diminished by his character. gtIt was Mifune who exposed Danzo as a manipulator before an explanation was interrupted by Zetsu who used Sasuke as a political pawn in creating the next war which Sasuke had little or no part of.Technically Ao did but that is irrelevant. ReZetsu it wasnt Zetsu who spectacularly jumped down and declared that he was in a bad mood then proceeded to try and take on the Five Kage which would have failed twice if not for Obito and Zetsus intervention. gtSasukes actions have benefited the ninja world. No matter what the reason the majority of his actions had a positive effect.First of all intent matters a damn lot in the justice system as well as in the western societys sense of morality. Theres a reason why vigilante justice is not permitted. However even if we ignore that the good Incapacitating Orochimaru and killng Deidara helping out vis a vis Kabuto is outweighed by the bad attempting the capture and murder of Killer B attempting to steal a Bijuu killing a deep cover agent in Akatsuki  you said the reason was irrelevant and breaking into the  Kage summit attempting to kill the  kage killing a crapload of samurai. Id add killing Danzo but thats what were debating and Id like to give more reason for that. Sasuke left the Leaf without a military or political leader. Even if you were a staunch Nixon supporter in  you would still have been worried after JFK was pronounced dead with the Cuban Missile Crisis still fresh in everyones mind.gtSasuke killed a head of state. Of course he is in hot water. Yes and that should automatically disqualify him from being a Kage.gtThey have no idea what kind of man he is. To the world he represents the will of fire not the corrupt delusional monster he really is. He. Does. Not. Represent. The. Will. Of. Fire. Nowhere in the manga apart from the elders and the deceased Hiruzen is Danzo remotely trusted. Kakashi Yamato and Tsunade are actively trying to subvert him the entire reign. No one internationally respects him. gtreminds me of the people who justify the Armenian Genocide. to which no person would outright admit it that I know. You know I debated responding to this or not. However the fact that its in there even crossed out and not removed preferably with an apology for comparing me to genocide sympathizers based on an out of context quote means its fair game. Really? Its a piece of fucking fiction not even historical at that and youre comparing me to genocide sympathizers? Yeah real mature right there. Dont bother responding btw unless you apologize for what Ive quoted. ,Naruto,ceg1rnm,0,t5_2quts

If before on sage mode he was able to have such a huge chakra pool due to his Uzumaki genes and the little bit of chakra he was getting from kurama it would be safe to assume that when he has control of kurama hed have much more chakra.

Somehow Haku dies then Zabuza gets super pissed and goes on a rampage and kills the bridge builder I think. Or someone he hated there its been awhile since I saw the ZabuzaHaku saga.  And then squad  goes home.Later in the Chunin Exams...Squad  finds Orochimaru deep In the forest of death.  Orochimaru spawns a giant snake and tries to kill them with it but Sasuke impresses Orochimaru with his Sharingan so Orochimaru decides he wants Sasukes body as his own so he plants the curse mark on Sasuke and takes his leave.

189261,0,t3_1w9gb0,I agree with you completely. NarutoSakura will not happen no matter what. Even if Kishi ends the manga with neither ending up together it will be implied through the love confession alone that Naruto is getting with Hinata.However you may have made a mistake at the top. I think you mean a NarutoSakura relationship will never happen not NarutoSasuke. In any case though neither will happen. I dont care that Naruto kissed Sasuke I dont give a damn that Naruto hasnt responded to Hinatas confession in the middle of the warzone. The kiss was an accident Naruto is heterosexual and were at war. Plus people seem to be forgetting that Naruto went eight tails might have been nine of Minato didnt step in. Let it never be said Naruto did not get angrier over Hinatas death than over Sasuke or Sakura. End of discussion. Seriously Naruto is heterosexual. He is the creator of the sexy jutsu and he did have a crush on Sakura.,Naruto,cezzvv1,9,t5_2quts

195017,0,t3_1w9gb0,Im going to do a rebuttal against you. Please note it will contain spoilers so if youre not caught up to at least the latest chapter do not read any further.I think it is a bit naive to assume an absolutist position when it comes to the particular pairing of NaruSaku. Your viewpoint on Sakura lying to Naruto is certainly valid and I think that there isnt anyone that truly believes that the interaction towards Naruto was truly genuine. However things start getting problematic when you deviate and claim that NaruSaku will never happen.I have to immediately state Im not much of a shipper at all. I like to stay true to the narrative presented by the plot so if the plot indicates a certain pairing Im going to go and abide by that because that is the standard Kishi has set rather than a personal desire for a pairing ie I dont ship ShikaTemari but the plot gives plenty of concrete evidence for me to go and actually believe that is what is to occur if Kishi decides to give some sort of epilogue.Throughout Shippuden weve seen this motif of character development and transition mixed with foreshadowing. Weve seen Sai drop plenty of hints that indicate a possibility of Kishi but again I refrain from speaking in absolute terms because things change. Biggest example? Kishi never following up with Hinatas confession and Hinata only being used as a plot device to further the battle with Naruto and Pain. Just an example.So Sai was dropping several of these hints prior to this incident occurring. This incident occurs but in no way can we ignore what follows up in the war.First off I want to say I dont think filler can be used as an argument. Ive seen your response about why you used it and how it clarifies what you stated but again filler is filler. Not to be disrespectful in any regard.Next the point you state about NarutoSakura never happening is immediately nullified Spoilersm When Naruto introduces Sakura to Minato in which a blatantly obvious parallel of Kushina and Minato is shown to Naruto and Sakura. This parallel is as ridiculous obvious as it gets when it comes to foreshadowing. The parallel isnt ambiguous and done in an attempt to make the reader think as the mention by Minato is simply downright obvious. Adding to this do remember that Kushina instructed Naruto to find someone like her as Freudian and bizarre is the statement comes my earlier point directly connects with this on a greater basis.Now for some interpretations that use a little less subtle evidence. Spoilersm The most recent chapter uses a parallel of Sakura focusing on Naruto while Karin focuses on Sasuke. Sure this can be interpreted in different ways but I do want to point out that through the chapters Sakura has focused far more on Naruto than Sasuke by huge margins. Why is this important? Well this shows further character development which was highlighted by Sai with her reaction to Sasuke returning. Additionally weve seen Naruto introduce Sakura as his girlfriend to Minato. To sum it up your argument doesnt work well in absolute terms because of the fact that character development with Sakura is employed.,Naruto,cf0nje9,5,t5_2quts

We all know the controversy with that one and Believe it was dropped around Episode So naturally this created a problem when the English version reached Kushina Naruto had no verbal tic and therefore Kushina wouldnt have a similar verbal tic. So to avoid a plot hole. They just had Naruto go Ya know a couple times before meeting her and we were apparently just supposed to believe that hed always done it and as a result Kushinas similar verbal tic Dattebane was replaced with Ya knowTLDR She said something embarrassingly childish in the Japanese version English version replaces childish comment with Ya know,Naruto,cf8kwlt,12,t5_2quts

Show me why youre my rival. with sad eyes that are almost smilingGuys body erupts with red steam which as it explodes him his mouth we see is blood. He leaps into battle with Madara who is on the complete defensive either barely stopping the attacks from connecting or getting facepummelled.We cut to the other dimension and we dont see Naruto. Sakura is asking Obito if they should leave soon because they may be needed. Obito shows that his connection to Kakashi has grown and he can see through his eye but that revelation may come in a later chapter and that right now they dont need to go back just yet.Cut back to the real world and Guy is looking like a train of pain he slaps God around a bit more because hes Might Guy and then he closes his eyes for a second smiles and puts both his hands into fists before whispering Evening TigerA bijuudama sized explosion rocks the godtree causing a branch to fall with the force. The branch falls harmlessly and Madara is down. Guy is breathing heavily but looks satisfied. GUY Madara huh... Not even worth remembering. He turns away sure that hes done it when no one else could knowing that this would be his last time to see his friends.Guys eyes open wide blood coming from his mouth. He looks down and sees that he is suddenly sharing far too much space with Madaras hand which is straight through his chest. He looks over his shoulder and Madara barely has a scratch on him he says something to Guy about remembrance and Guy dies.Kakashi is the only one not looking at Guy hes looking behind the group of good guys eyes wide.

588329,0,t1_cg74vgx,Take it like this who is a more likable character out of Jiraiya and Karin? Which of them is considered annoying and obsessive? We write off Jiraiyas actions because that is just how men are and dont really attribute it to his overall character. Karin on the other hand is portrayed to be quite annoying and pathetic with her obsessions and impulses. Why is it that there are so many female medical ninjas? With the exception of Kabuto I do not remember any plotrelevant medical ninjas. I dont think Kishi is very progressive with his female characters Tsunade included because she is genuinely strong in body and mind...although is subverted when her main jutsu is keeping herself young and beautiful.I actually do wish that women would come forward with their sexuality. It is very empowering for both women and men to embrace their sexual natures and not be ashamed of them. If you read other manga the perverted male character is almost a staple whereas the female pervert is somewhat of an anomaly. Even though I am a guy I do identify as a feminist and wish that sexuality would be more open for all genders. My intimate experience with Japanese women has been VERY interesting in terms of cultural relevance. I think rnaruto is a childfriendly place so I will save that one for another day. I think Japan has some work to do with gender equality in both its reality and fictional environments.,Naruto,cg75b03,20,t5_2quts
589580,0,t1_cg733tu,I dont remember when this was but Naruto once said something like how could I ever become hokage if I cant even save one friend.

I think that beyond Sasuke its possible his plans are bigger than hokage  Naruto would want a world that is accepting and forgiving not hateful and violent.

636356,0,t1_cgcl22a,It doesnt say it anywhere. Theres no proof of anything other than Ashura being inside Naruto. There has been a theme of love vs hate all throughout the course of Naruto history you cant say AshuraIndra has been inside every single one of them. I think its more remnants of their feelings passed down through the generations. The old uchiha curse came directly from Indras anger at his brother. Even orochimaru went nuts for the same reason for a while. Events repeat and bind the story together to show you these recurring themes all throughout. Its a tale of love friendship and comradery vs solitude hate jealousy and anger.The only thing I can say is Narutos side is winning because hes managed to win over everyone hes encountered through our beloved talk no jutsu. But its not just talk no jutsu. He says things from his heart. All of his words spoken to the people who fight him permeate with this lovesentiment. He changes people for the better and he still has to change Sasuke before this is all over  and cleanse Indras soul.Also one thing Id like to make note of is the tree. The curse of love and hatred is because Kaguya took the trees fruit and for centuries the souls of sop sons have been reborn countless of times their reincarnations repeating the same foolish mistake over and over. The point is Indras line has never been born with hatred in their heart they have love and then the love corrupts just as Indras once did. That theme always repeats because of Kaguyas cursed children. Thats something that will be hard for Naruto to overcome!,Naruto,cgclr99,7,t5_2quts

His line of thought clearly answers the original post about how in certain conditions earth grounds lightning.

The sage seems to regret how he raised his sons  first favoring the elder for being closer to his own image and talents then for favoring the younger when he found his own strength.If I may play armchair pop psychologist I submit that Indra got his fathers love and affection and flourished while that love and affection was withheld from Ashura who in turn floundered. Ashura was defined by his efforts to gain his fathers approval while Indra was defined by havinghis fathers approval. This doesnt seem like a stretch  Indra took more closely after his father so the Sage had an easier time relating to him and spending time with him than Ashera who likely acted out just to get attention even if it wasnt positive  sound familiar?.When Ashera finally got his fathers approval and became the successor Indras world was turned upside down.

I took the idea of the art hobby and then applied a touch of defensive in addition to some pretty crazy aoe damage in maelstrom and shattered ward.

787857,0,t1_cgtt22r,Theres literally nothing that has occurred after the  Kage Summit that wasnt implied or foreshadowed. Everything that has occurred has been something mentioned or alluded to. The whole reincarnation part was to purely make sense of the level of parallelism in the series. Sasukes transition wasnt seamless either. Kid was manipulated the entire series until his second meeting with Itachi. The kid has finally become his own man and is finally taking his life into his own hands. The  tails wasnt even seamless either. All of Shippuden was about his gradual acceptance of Naruto and how Naruto was different from everyone who used him before. Also the only reason every villain has joined the good side is because all the actually evil people are dead and those that remain cant remain evil if the world is taken over by an even more evil guy. Its the whole The enemy of my enemy is my friend sort of thing because Orochimaru cant evil if the world he desires to understand so much is a fallacy. Even Obito was merely an Uchiha version of Nagato who let his delusion go too far which is an insanely normal thing even in real life. And also its not like the guy he was working for didnt try to kill him like  minutes prior to his changing of sides and its not like hes not gonna die soon either.  Now Im not saying youre wrong to feel the way you do but dude your complaints are all seemingly against character development and this idea that people dont change. The entire point of Naruto has been about coming to understand one another. I will agree that One Piece is the better of the two series but Bleach is just a giant clusterfuck of bad plotlines next to no actual character development and doesnt even know what foreshadowing is.

This is why I used the term Izanagilike. I know others have even drawn parallels to the as of yet unknown creation of all things. That doesnt make sense since the sage was supposed to use yin and yang chakra in each hand wasnt he?. The power could just as easily be teleportation especially given the sound effect as Sasuke reappeared after dodging Madaras first lightning attack. It could also be an entirely different thing.

He defeated  Gates Gai without his second eye which is a monumental feat considering how powerful Gai was.Youre acting like Kishimoto is not a professional author whos been creating this story for  years.

Sakura is born with nothing yet she manages to be just as good if not better than Tsunade who has Senju DNA in her.Its not fair to compare her to Sasuke and Naruto because Naruto is born was an amazing chakra pool and a life force to surpass probably even the Senju and Sasuke is an Uchiha need I say more? You dont need a yardstick to mesure strength. Im not sure the analogy works here. Its not that Sakura beats Konohamaru its how she beats him.

1084997,0,t3_26iktl,I like aspects of both some voices im just really into in the dub that i feel lacking in the sub some i really like in sub and dont in dub. Generally though Subs are better if only because they are further along and release on more reliable schedules not because of any issues with the voices.If both were on indentical schedules releasing at the same time id probably chose dubbed hearing it in my native language just seems more natural.Others though i honestly cant watch One Piece in sub i try it from time to time but the dubbed voices were just so much more perfect in my opinion that i simply cannot make that transition.With naruto ill happily watch it in either as both generally stay up to around the same quality with dragonball z i watch in dub mostly because of Gokus voice in the sub i get why it is that way i just dont like it.,Naruto,chrm70x,3,t5_2quts

One is that like Minato with Naruto she sealed parts of her chakra into the Gedo statue. When Madara hooked himself up to it Kaguya was able to taint him and transfer that chakra into Black Zetsu. The other theory is that because Indra was reincarnated into Madara I think Kaguya did something to Indra that started the whole fight between Ashura and his brother. Maybe she sealed herself into him or something and when Madara created Black Zetsu her piece inside Indra was extracted and put into it.,Naruto,cht4f57,6,t5_2quts

During the girl version of sexy no jutsu KonohamaruKishimoto depicted Sasuke and Sai together for a reason. . Naruto and Sasuke is too damn obvious Hahah. It would have sealed the deal with Kishi preferring their pairing once and for all and . Both of them are very er ambiguous about their preference. Especially Sai holy cow!And Naruto... well he is a tough one. Its not that hes trying to get Sasuke to like him again well sort of... its that hes really slow and slow to realise how much Sasuke cared for him then it became too late and Sasuke left him alone  He was left with nothing but memories of Sasuke and had a lot of time to think about what Sasuke means to him and what he means to Sasuke.

With a barage of Rasengans and FTG Minato may be able to break through Susanoo and catch Itachi.You mention tactical prowess. Itachi actually wins that one since he is believed to be one of the most skilled and genius tactics in the hidden leaf  with insight like that of a Hokage even before gaining MS. However Minato is very straightforward in his techniques and usage. This makes tactical advantages null since his techniques are very easy to see but hard to react too. Itachi cannot win by using offense since Minato is too fast and intelligent. His only chance of victory isa Hoping Minato cant break Susanoo. In which case he will be absolutely fine and Minato will lose.b Using Susanoo as a shield until he can prepare and succesfully use a genjutsu on Minato. Once Minato is hit by something like Izanami or Tsukuyomi he has been oneshot.,Naruto,cibjtcs,10,t5_2quts

1284543,0,t1_cie3sue,Great points. Also we got to see in Hashiramas final battle with Madara that his ultimate form is his Sage mode... Once again he accepts chakra from nature around him feeding into nature backing Ashura. Same with Naruto and his Sage powers vs Sasukes EMS. I really think the Shinjus will is going to come into play through HashiramaNarutoAshura like you intimate here.gtPerhaps the tree opposes Kaguya.I think this is exactly what it is. Black Zetsu just revealed as well that the Juubi was not the Shinju trying to get its chakra back but rather it was Kaguyas willbody trying to get her chakra back from HagoromoHamura. Thats huge as that fact always painted the Shinju as vengeful. I think its that when Kaguya ate the Shinjus fruit she gained power over chakra and twisted its existence into the Infinite Tsukuyomi. It may be that the Shinju is more benevolent than we have been led to believe which makes me think of Hashirama his personality and his kekkei genkei. It may be that just as Kaguya was sealed by her sons the Shinju was sealed by Kaguya into the IT and just as Kaguyas portioned some of her will into Black Zetsu the Shinju portioned a bit of itself into HagoromoAshuraHashiramaNaruto.

1428294,0,t3_2ahxez,My opinion Id say most of the movies are just something to watch when you have nothing else to do. Honestly the first two were kinda lacking in plot and I didnt find them too interesting except for Blood Prison Lost Tower and Road to Ninja. Blood Prison has a slightly different plot and the characters werent so bad so I enjoyed that a little more. Lost Towers had a better plot with Minato in it so I thought it was pretty cool. By far the best one and a must watch in my opinion was Road to Ninja. The plot was excellent and actually relates to the main story much more than any of the others. I personally loved the alternate personalities of the normal Naruto characters wont say much more because I dont to spoil it for you. To answer your questions Most of the films are going to be separate from the story and its hard to compare them to the Kakashi filler arc because they are so different. All I will say is that if your a big naruto fan like me the last three are worth watching and I think Road To Ninja is a must watch. Oh and the rd one is based on Kakashi so you should watch that one too.,Naruto,civbbc0,2,t5_2quts

1534201,0,t1_cj8jcxp,I see your point but there is a further possible example in Madara. He was able to use Hashirmas wood jutsu when he was edo using the wood dragon against the Kyuubi and the tails which he shows he copied the seals of Hashirama during their fight but seemingly lost the ability when he was rinne tenseid and lost his eyes. The Madara Izanagi example As you know Izanagi is the baility to rewrite your own reality but to do that one must decide on this new reality. When Madara used his timedelayed izanagi he already had decided his new reality this is his memory and that memory had to be stored in his eye. This because we know Tobirama studied Madaras corpse including his brain and Tobirama would have noticed active chakra inside Madaras brain shows us Madaras eye contained everything neccessary to use Izanagi including the memory. Yeah I agree with youThis discussion also made me think of something else Black Zetsu and his ability to record through his eyes....,Naruto,cj8l6qh,1,t5_2quts

I firmly believe after seeing that it can be done and done well. My ideal collab to do it would be Zack Snyder Stephen Chow and Kishi working to create something beautiful.

Im not sure but I think in this chapter Kaguya is able to control her form again and she makes a giant tailedbeast bomb with all chakra types and blood limits and theres no way to stop it except finally sealing her with narutosasuke reincarnation justu so Team  does a combo attack to do that.

Just use it to get closer than you would and draw less attention to yourself in order to launch surprise attack paperbomb sucide bomber?Big Mistakes were Trying to impersonate and getting the personality all wrong He did a gennin level transformation and copied Naruto reversed and didnt account mirror what he was looking.My point was that it could be used for turning into random villagers from another villiager to infiltrate  deeper or spy as opposed to the current meta of walking right in there with your headband on kakashi gaidenAgain the transformation would be for turning into a stranger so Kibas nose would be useless unless he sniffed all of the Land of Fires residents. Shinos bugs dont randomly inspect villiagers that are walking by unless he tells them too which would mean he already knew. Hinata like a mention has Dojutsu which is is rare in Konoha and very rare in the Narutoverse so I dont count it as in a war it could still be effective even if one ofthe villageskonaha has ish Dojutsu users.Second Kaguya has been shown to be susceptible to the transformation jutsu even though she has the Byakugan so it isnt a remove all justu ability or when a joninlevel shinobi uses it Naruto it can hard to see through.,Naruto,cjxinsz,1,t5_2quts

1866443,0,t1_cke11kw,Oh man where to start.....Madara being totally OP against the kage and even more so with his rinnegan yet is disappointing AF once he becomes the juubi jinchuriki. Limbo seemingly being a very powerful move that ends up just being invisible clones. Black zetsu pretty much taking him out with a fucking stab when gais night guy attack possibly one of the strongest moves seen didnt even kill him. Kaguya being a gay ass lame villain with no development. Kakashi gaining perfect susanoo and being much better than sasuke. Sasukes new eye basically having a shitty version of the flying thunder god and having none of the six paths abilities. Sakura landing a fairly damaging blow against kaguya breaking one of her horns when sasuke couldnt even do any damage at all to her. Naruto and sasukes anticlimatic finish against said lame villain. We never get to soo the god rabbit form of kaguya. The equally disappointing end to black zetsu which were still not sure what he was. The weak ass goodbye from all the kage brought in by the sage using some spacetime jutsu never elaborated on out of nowhere since when do the dead kage even care about helping or even knowing about this jutsu?. The sage not explaining what happened with his brother and how he came to gain both yin and yang powers. What the purpose of Madara spitting out the sage tools was. What hashiramas jutsu against madara was gonna be.

1870721,0,t1_cke9hoi,Heres my prediction. Naruto enters Sage mode. Hes the only one who can use sage chakra right now since Jugo is stuck in the Infinite Tsukiyomi. Thats his one advantage and without any Bijuu sealed inside him hes got the ability to fuse with Ma and Pa frog at will. It will probably never come to this though because he still has the enhanced Senjutsu from the Sage of the Six paths.. The only way the Infinite Tsukiyomi can end is if Sasuke and Naruto use their sealing technique to undo the ultimate genjutsu. Also Naruto still sees Sasuke as a friend. In Narutos mind he has to save Sasuke not just for his friendship but also for the sake of the Bijuu the ninja coalition and the remainder of his friends. So just like Tobi Nagato Gaara Kurama and the Bijuu Haku and Zabuza before him he will save the one person he is closest to....but not without an awesome fight. I predict it lasts thirty chapters and the battle against Kaguya will be seen as nothing but a precursor.,Naruto,ckem5r0,1,t5_2quts

1873896,0,t3_2g2ex7,I think things got better after all that Kaguya bullshit. Yea they need Sasuke and I do think he will be TnJd to a certain extent. I think Sasuke will be the one to convince Naruto that the new ninja system needs a change. A big change. So in turn Naruto will convince  Sasuke that the way he is going about things is wrong and that they can work towards that goal in a more peaceful way. That would be my ideal ending because it has potential to bring change to the shinobi system while Naruto sticks to his Nind and doesnt resort to killing Sasuke like how Hashirama killed Madara.,Naruto,ckezxks,1,t5_2quts
1874203,0,t1_cke9hoi,This might bring in orochimarus resurrection of the current live kages in perspective... if he knew of course.

1885795,0,t1_ckgduys,I dont think he actually wants to be hokage I saw it more as hinting to him wanting amp willing to lead a change. Killing the current gokage is probably just the beginnings of dissolving the hidden villages amp browsers for creating a truly unified peaceful nation in his mind. Hes being radical but not clearly dictator radical just yet.,Naruto,ckgfikj,2,t5_2quts
1890025,0,t1_ckgtova,Dont be so sure of the reality youre in now as more real than anything else. if you perceive it as real theres no reason to say it isnt. I THINK THEREFORE I AM especially if the thoughts are better than anything you could get in other states amp just as real. Madara gave people their PERFECT lives how is that evil? If Kaguya forcing everyone to Zetsu in it there wouldnt be a downside. That its forced on a war driven people that should somehow come to chose peace when they fully know how to achieve it but never really try out of inconvenience makes it evil? Theyre more evil on a daily basis to each other killing each other over ideals any side seriously considers to try. If there was such a divine intervention in our lives dont bullshit amp act like youre going to say nah Im good take your universal perfection boundless happiness and total immersion amp fuck off because I like to think this is a more concrete reality though its probably not at all you nor anybody else would deny the opportunity to safely be in heaven. Madara was all about. The reason I bet Kishi wrote Kaguya in was to progress the story amp not have Madara tnj Naruto like he was clearly about to do. He made it backfire because if he didnt then Naruto wouldve ended actually being the selfish person of the situation trying to save people by bringing them down to a shit reality which he sort is regardless since hes still trying to do it without a plan to fix the trauma of being ripped from perfection amp put in an unfair desperate war torn world half of the population is convinced is secretly Hell. Imagine if the world is like the Matrix but everybody is happy amp we can be Neo without anything fight against then fuck it we all win. Naruto didnt solve shit with the Bijuu theyre HIS friends not everyone elses. they mistrust humans amp they shouldnt given they enslave Bijuu when they can. They were free destroying shit whenever before Hashirama pawned them off for a false sense of peace. Narutos plan is become Hokage which he isnt ready for amp enforcing peace himself which seems more like a dictator than a coup. The current system isnt the alliance thats the emergency response amp the newest gokage is Gaara hes the  that fought for the war alliance while the others sat in complacency just as theyve been doing for decadesbarring Tsunade who hasnt actually fixed anything. The gokage have been able to negotiate peace but never have. They need a common enemy to unite but that doesnt work for peace without child soldiers conditioned to kill their every relative if they want change. Narutos plan at best is trying to Ninshuu tnj all conflict but at the failure of Hagaromo himself to stop his children it cant solve all conflict amp Naruto doesnt have actual answers for complex issues he just tells people shut up amp hits them talking about how he grew up sorta tough amp can empathize with their pain even if its not as great so they should emphasize when causing pain to others just continues the cycle of it. People over charge Narutos past he was raised by Iruka amp Hiruzen people didnt like him because he was an absolute asshole kid that did anything for any attention amp was a constant reminder of the shitass system with Bijuu amp power structure which they all got over amp now love him. Sasukes entire life has literally been a lie amp based on corruption amp suffering. Im not backing Sasuke as intelligent in his decision its clearly not the best way to go about peace but hes justified in his actions given whats happened has been absolutely corrupt amp evil. Naruto doesnt know the extent of it like Sasuke. Naruto is an blissful idiot savant Sasuke is a totured cynical genius neither is more valid.,Naruto,ckgxuid,1,t5_2quts

I think getting  and  would be best for you if youre just looking for plot but Revolutions is looking really awesome with a revamped fighting system and new additions. I suggest getting  and Full Burst and if by the time youre done with them youre still looking for more Revolutions can hold you until .Full Burst is the same as  with an added character and an extra Sasuke chapter in the story thats pretty important. It has a cool boss battle too I think its worth the extra  bucks. It should also be noted that s story mode ending is not canon.

1959618,0,t3_2h407p,Basically one way to get out of a genjutsu is to have another teammate disrupt the chakra that is manipulating your chakra and creating the genjutsu. To be honest the answer to your question is that most jinchuriki can be placed under genjutsu its the ones that have become friends with their tailed beasts that cant be placed under due to the beast being able to use their chakra to disrupt the genjutsu from inside the jinchuriki similar to how it would be normally done. Think of it like someone on a leash with their arms tied normally another person or formed would have to cut the rope to get them out but with tailed beasts its like you grow another arm and that cute the rope.,Naruto,ckpc3ze,7,t5_2quts

The tailed beast took connections to become stronger.Naruto would never of been able to acquire as many Sharingan power ups as Sasuke.  The sharingan requires the severing of bonds and hatred.  In order to get MS you have to feel immense emotion usually caused by trauma in order to get EMS you must have your brothers eyes.  Even Susanoo became stronger as Sasukes hatred and conviction grew.I think you have grown blind to the fact that at one point both of these guys were kids.  A kid would not be able to grow up with the Tailed Beasts and Sharingan at the same time and nurture both.Finally who cares how average someone would be if you took away what they worked for?

2000100,0,t1_cku5zk3,gtI NEVER said he was the strongest.Yes. He wasnt. gtI said the most influential. True. But in a bad way and that doesnt make him the by far the best hokage aas the title of your thread. gt This whole series would have been different if without Tobiramas input.True. With NO inputs from TobiramaMadara would have worked with Hashirama like he was trying to do. Like when Hashi and Madaar were on the top of the mountain overlooking Konoha and discussing shit and hearing each other out. Madara held no grudge against him. Infact he was pleasantly surprised how effective Hashiramas ideas were becoming. He was overwhelmed by the idea that other powerful clans like the sarutobi were joining the alliance of Uchiha and the Senju what Konoha was called before Madara named it. He supported Hahashirama until AFTER Hahsirama became Hokage because of Tobiramas meddling with the affairs. And after some deep thought he said fuck it! Im out of here and went ahead with Eternal Tsukyuyomi plan. All of this could have been  avoided if Tobirama hadnt interfered. Indeed Tobirama has been nothing but a fucking CURSE to Konoha and indirectly to the entire WORLD.gtThe village wouldnt of been what it was today without him.Yes. The founding fathers and some of the strongest men in Konoha the uchihas blamed wrongly for the Kyuubi attack WOULDNT have been killed. Who knows maybe Konoha would have survived the Pain Invasion if the strong police force of the uchiha was with them. gtThe whole village opposed the Uchiha. Not just Madara directly.Dipshit Konoha is officially the village made by the union of the Uchiha and the Senju. Their cooperation made possible Konoha in the first place. Everybody opposed the Uchiha? You fucking serious retard? It was only after the false accusation of controlling Kyuubi at the the night of the Kyuubi attack that the village started to oppose the Uchiha. The same village the Uchiha help made in the first place. gt When the war began Kabuto was not apart of the plan. Regardless of what jutsu was used the war wouldve occurred regardless.What the fuck you talking about? Heres how the part of the conversation was going down somebody implied that Tobirama is bad because he created Edotensei leading to many tragedies in the Ninja World War. You implied that the use of Edotensei by the good side has been phenomenal. The use of edotensei by the bad side has either been fanservice or inconsequential anyways because madara would have been revived of reinne tensei and cause the same damage.  to which I implied that you were talking out of your ass. I implied that if the casualities by the use of edotensei in Ninja WW is fanservice then the jutsus credited as creation of Tobirama are also fanservice. I implied that a good portion of  ninjas died DUE TO EDOTENSEI plus of that meteor used by Madara. He could only use the metero because he was edotenseid and not rinnetenseid. Like he originally planned to. And that Tobirmama is to be blamed for all this.YOU WERE IMPLYING THAT EDOTENSEI A CREATION OF TOBIRAMA CAUSED MORE GOOD THAN HARM. I IMPLIED THE OPPOSITE. No body is arguing if the war could have been avoided or not. gtDo you think the outcome of Madara Vs. Everyone wouldve been different if he didnt drop the meteor? I dont recall any of them even getting close to touching him.GET YOUR FUCKING FACTS STRAIGHT. It was only because Kabutos edotensei that Madara came back in the mortal world. Otherwise TobiObito at that point had no intentions of bringing madara back. Learn to fucking read. Is the stereotype that Blacks cant read true? gtIt was commonly known the Sharingan evolved through hate and severing bonds.By commonly known you mean Im a fucking racist with no respect to facts and critical thinking believing in a massive fucking douche Tobirama because fuck it I lack the sophistication to read and comprehend the subtleties in art and life.Here are some other things that are commonly known Backs are niggers. Lesser evolved kin in the human race because their brain size is smaller. They should be killed because they are a curse to civilization. EastAsians are Pigs. Look at their eyes. They dont feel emotions and dont have souls.  Jews deserve to be killed because they killed the messiah. A huge sin. Kaffirs should be killed because they are lesser human beings because they dont believe in Allah. They are lesser than Pigs. Which is like the most fould creature on earth according to muslims. Once again dumb shit LEARN TO FUCKING READ.As I wrote earlier gtKakashi without an Uchiha brain achieves Sharingan. Contrary to what Tobirama predicted that the Sharingan was a symptom of hate generated by the uchiha brain.Therefore Tobirama indeed talked out of his ass. Plus Itachis Sharingan evolved when he saw Shuishui die. He didnt hate shuishui. Obitos Sharingan evolved when trying to save Kakashi from an invisible rain ninja. He wasnt severing bonds. Heres my take on what Sharingan supposedly does. Unlike your assessment it actually makes a lot of sense because I can fucking read. The sharingan eyes upgrade when an Uchiha loses someone dear or is in a moment of pure despair. What the eyes do to the Uchiha is I believe make them adamant. Because Sharingan eyes upgrade after a severe loss these eyes can be seen as souvenirs of that loss and an uchiha is CONSTANTLY reminded of that loss or hopelessness all his remaining life. All his life he is reminded of pure despair and hurt he was once unfortunate enough to encounter in the past of his life. And an uchiha NEVER overcomes that. In our context Basically uchihas are the race of people that are giving an overwhelming importance to the hopelessness of the Past. They are always painting the past in a negative light because they are hardwired to give overwhelming attention to only the atrocities that happened in the past. This makes them what they are. This what defines Sasuke.gtyour basis for importance is how many fights theyve been in.And who told you this? Is Hashirama remembered as the guy who defeat Madara and Kakuzu or the kind brown guy who founded the leaf and made children safe from the horrors of war? Is Sarutobi remembered for his fights or his love for children? Is minato remeber for his fight against the Kyuubi or his amazing sacrifice for the well being of the people of Konoha? Tobirama is NOT remembered by the people for any of the things because he didnt do any! TOP FUCKING LEL. Really well done Kishi. WELL DONE!gtThe whole end of your statement is all personal opinions and I cant argue with a opinion.Once again you are forcing me to accept the stereotype that Blacks cant read when you write shit like this. Lets recap for a second You have written that Tobiramas the most gangsta hokage the leaf ever had. Also  Tobirama dont take no sh!t. hes like a uchiha in a senju body. Infact when I replied with manga canon that Kishi has constantly shit on Tobirama if you pay any attention then you dont reply to it.Then I reply with facts that how Tobiramas theory on Uchiha is wrong with the help of Kakshis  life story. To which you reply It was commonly known the Sharingan evolved through hate and severing bonds.. BY WHOM? HOW? WHAT? Please expand dumb nword.Then you reach to this conclusion Tobirama isnt remembered by anything? your basis for importance is how many fights theyve been in. What are the other kages contributions that dont include fighting a Big Bad. Reaaching to this conclusion without providing a fucking source from the manga.Now who is exactly fucking talking out of his ass and making opinions while using no facts at all. gtBut Tsunade being a more influential kage because Amazing tits and her being a female is just stupid.Interesting how you left the other part of my sentence out. She is remembered more fondly by the people of Konoha not me its manga canon becuase she revolutionized the way ninja teams were made up. She intorduced the concept of the medic nina which apparently has saved a lot of lives in the subsequent wars. Cant you fucking read and quote my entire sentence? Fucking Vishnu!,Naruto,cku7mj6,-3,t5_2quts

But after Madara left the village Im pretty sure Kurama wrapped in Perfect Susano will beat the Yata Mirror.  Especially considering Itachi cant keep his Susano up as long as Madara.

Those that Nagato chose to be the Paths of Pain were just a few of those.Sasukes that jutsu was the technique Hashirama gave him to seal Sage Chakra.  Just like the Sages tools they were probably just an option that Kishimoto set aside for himself that he decided not to use.As for Kirin I think that Sasuke can do it without the set up but it would require was more chakra to use which is why he simply just put up his hand when he met Team .  In his fight with Itachi Sasuke was low on chakra at that point so he made it easier for himself by making it cloudy with a Fire Style Jutsu rather than attempt to summon the living incarnation of lightning on a clear sunny day.Narutos that jutsu was the Reverse Harem Jutsu.,Naruto,clmddve,5,t5_2quts

I have however seen numerous death threats directed at Kishi by NaruHina fans. Tumblr NaruHina shippers have done that quite frequently. You are just claiming facts without anything to back them up. Sakura was the first to acknowledge him that didnt prior to the manga pilot. I know because I looked back at the manga. You also say that you have no problem with the ship when in your previous comment you gladly gloated about how our ship is in the water... Yeah right buddy.,Naruto,clowm0c,2,t5_2quts

2249048,0,t1_clpp0f9,Yes thats something I began to notice after both watching and reading the series. Kishimoto really likes inferred parallels he uses them for practically every scenario and relationship in the series. Some are obvious like the parallel between nuclear weapons and jinchuuriki while others are more nuanced the yinyang relationships on topic. To be honest I find more enjoyment out of extracting his thematic undertones from the plot than the actual plot itself. Mainly because people often slam Naruto for being not well written without really providing anything beyond the main relationship in the series Naruto and Sasuke. While hes certainly not fantastic hes definitely not terrible his worldmaking ability is unreal and while somewhat tacky the relationships are more nuanced and more consistent than most give him credit for.A lot of it is only now coming into focus with the end arriving so soon. ,Naruto,clppdlh,1,t5_2quts

2400565,0,t3_2mvjhb,Such garbage rationalisations.Neither NaruHina nor SasuSaku had any mutual basis in the manga. They were entirely onesided right until the every end. Kishimoto only ever developed NaruSaku into something meaningful. It had a rocky start they became comrades then they became friends and all through out their journey together Naruto had feelings for Sakura whilst she in turn was beginning to have feelings for him.If there is one thing that annoys me its that this pairing was never given any closure. Kishimoto himself acknowledges that he considered this pairing which I think is putting it lightly considering the hints and teases and parallels to JirTsu ObiRin and MinaKushi. I think he set up NH and SS to fail because but ultimately couldnt allow them to because they had become too popular and so regardless of the fact Naruto loved Sakura and regardless of the fact the manga gave us nothing but reasons why SasuSaku shouldnt happen the two ships that werent meant to happen happened and because theyre popular and I say this with great disappointment the fandom is happy to overlook Kishimotos sexist rationalisations and means of validating a relationship that is toxic demeaning and disrespectful to women.,Naruto,cm8f27b,4,t5_2quts

Im not trying to argue that Tsunade or Sakura is on par with Hashirama or The second mizukage or anything just that they are much much stronger than more average ninjas like Hinata.  Also since people seem to think that you cant like more than one girl I thought Id say I like Hinata as well but her strengths lie on more than just the battlefield.

She gets the same amount of development as Sakura in regards to relationship which in both cases is pathetic but i disagree that NaruSaku is supported by the series. Sakura literally never sees Naruto as a love interest she pretends to for one scene and Naruto sees right though it. Naruto is interested in Sakura for most of part   but i see maybe  or  instances in shippuden and even then its not much. That being said he doesnt show interest in Hinata at all until like one moment in the war arc that could easily just be him being friendly. ,Naruto,cm9j75c,7,t5_2quts

2420315,0,t1_cmapeoq,I dont know how many more times it needs to be said by Kishimoto and his staff and how many times it needs to be reconfirmed by translators that NaruSaku is unequivocally dead. Christ its the love lives of  fictional characters. If youre disappointed go write a fanfiction or something.Seriously you have a long thoroughly explained translation thats backed up by other trusted translators. It has a few corrections from me and my professional seal of approval. You dont even have an agenda in regards to pairings. Theres no argument about whos right and whos wrong.Dont even get me started on that idiotic ranting. Why would you waste time learning Japanese? Because Japan is the third biggest economy in the world for now anyway and theres a tonne of work for translators there as companies start to expand outwards and Japan continues to push its cool Japan soft power agenda. Theres plenty of money in it Ive made thousands of dollars a week before in it and have you SEEN interpreter fees? And actually Japanese and Mandarin are regarded around the same level of difficulty for English speakers. In fact the source below even says its harder.If youre gonna try and call out someone elses work you should at least be able to show you have the skill to know what youre talking about. As far as Im concerned no such expertise has been shown.And the you can find out the meaning of any Japanese online? You can find lists of equivalent words but youll never know which one to use without the knowledge to back it up. This can only really be gained in my opinion from living in Japan or actually studying your ass off which is why people on Japanese degrees are usually sent to study in Japan as exchange students.OrganicDinosaur would love to see some of those comments!,Naruto,cmauyme,2,t5_2quts

2552021,0,t3_2oxwx7,I would probably rank Jiraya  He is probably the symbolic parent that Minato and Kushina were meant to be.  NegatoPain  He is the person who adds depth to Narutos character and arguably taught him how to save Sasuke.  Obito  He is literally Naruto who had everything gone wrong for him. He is admittingly a cliche character but still very captivating. Kakashi  He failed to stop the world from ending but he did nurtured  savior to correct histhe worlds mistake. Teacher of the century award goes to him. Itachi  He is probably the most well written character in the entire series. A prodigy limited by his shortcomings that proves why Naruto succeeds.  Sasuke  He was annoying until the final arc. He was redeemed from the final arc. A slightly less op version of Itachi. Tsunade  The backbone of Naruto. She supported him in so many ways. Her medic jutsu and decisions also make her one of the  best hokage imo. Shikamaru Chouji Ino  There should be a gaiden that features them. They were the only real Shinobi team that requires teamwork to succeed and compensate each others weakness. ZabuzaHaku  The first real enemies of team kakashi. They taught them so much. SakuraHinataSai  They were given important roles. Pretty much it. ,Naruto,cmropnk,0,t5_2quts

If Kakashi tried Raikiri on Tsunade at best it would impale her and stick giving Tsunade to punch the shit out of him. At worst Kakashi catches a fist before connecting and at Kakashis speed thats an instant KO for Tsunade.

Naruto having to grow strong enough to extinguish that hate is why he achieved such ridiculous power levels.

The art where his rasengan is blue looks like drawings Kishimoto did for the Road to Ninja movie.

3242682,0,t1_coxznnx,Rinnegan is complicated... Its Samsaras eye for a reason. It gives you many different powers as uAshneaska mentioned. Its main abilities are the paths in a game you would pretty much call this the active abilities.. Deva Path  Gravity manipulation. Using a bunch of techniques the wielder of the rinnegan control gravity itself to either push things away or other more complicated manipulation. The sage used this ability to create the moon. Madara summoned a meteor with this path. . Asura Path  Can turn parts of the users body into metal or mechanise body parts. Pretty much makes you a cyborg and back again at will. Oh and you can fire pure chakra like a canon.. Human Path  YOU CAN REAP PEOPLES SOUL! And read minds thats cool. Gives the Rinnegan wielder the ability to touch and manipulate souls to a degree. . Animal Path  Summoning basicly. While other shinobi needs summoning contracts a rinnegan wielder dont. Simple as that. They can summon anything as long as they are not bound by another summoning contract. Including humans.. Preta Path  The ultimate cop out. Gives the user the ability to absorb and convert chakra. Or they can give it to others. Basicly redirect and change chakra. Needs to touch to a degree. You can absorb almost any Ninjutsu thrown at you. Or at least the chakra in the jutsu.. Naraka Path  Summon the King of hell Apparently it can restore broken things and heal wounded humans i think. We dont know much about this ability actually but it can apparently also be used for interrogation.. Outer Path  Power over the samsara cycle or life and death. The extra ability apparently. It is called the sage of the six paths but the rinnegan has ... Maybe sage of the seven paths doesnt sound that good. Oh well. With this ability you can among other things resurrect the dead. Yup you heard that right. Resurrect the dead. Not in the halfassed way of Edo Tensei but literally bring back peoples souls from the afterlife or the pure world or whatever. They need their bodies though or else where would the soul go? It also heals the body so you dont die straight afterwards. This also claims a portion of your lifeforce not just chakra. Depending on how many or who dont really know you resurrect.Now this may seem overpowered but there is more. The wielder of the Rinnegan has equal aptitude for all five chakra natures. And they can combine them and therefore be able to use every elemental kekkei genkai in the world. I will theorize this is part of the Preta Path which is the ability to convert chakra to many different forms.Then you have the Banbutsu Sozo Creation of all things. You can make matter out of chakra. You can literally turn energy into matter anything you can imagine. This was how the forms of the tailed beasts was made. Based on YinYang chakra. I dont actually know if you have to have rinnegan to use this but I imagine you do. The only person to ever do it was Hagoromo the sage himself.Also chakra receivers and chakra chains. There is a whole lot about them too. Derives from the Outer path and can... ehh... seal stuff? Or at least the chains can. The chakra receivers can disrupt chakra to others and transfer your own. If you stab someone with it you can try to move their bodies against their will. Probably not very easy though...Is that everything? Hmm... Nope youre also immune to genjutsu. Again this is probably due to the Preta Path which just absorbs the foreign chakra in your system.So is that enough for you? There are probably more but I cant remember everything and I did use the wiki to help me. Remember you dont start with all these abilities. You still have to learn and master everything. Is it overpowered? Yes. Is it awesome? Yes. Do they look awesome? Hell Yeah!PS.We have often seen people with one Rinnegan and one other type of eye... cough cough Sharingan. I dont think one eye is as good as two but they can still do part of these abilities if not all. However to what degree is unknown.I want these eyes...Badly.,Naruto,coy40us,11,t5_2quts

We know Team  seemingly forgives him because he truly sees the error of his ways and then is an important part in stopping Kaguya and saving the world. For all we know everyone else still saw him as a villain and he would most likely have been imprisoned if he had lived.. Agreed I wish that Madara had been the final villain as opposed to Kaguya.. Hamura isnt too important when compared to Kaguya who is an actual big character. The lack of build up for Kaguya is poor writing in my opinion it makes it very hard to care about her or care about the fight against her in general. . People always seem to only think of the animes portrayal of the first Naruto vs. Sasuke fight for good reason. That fight in the manga is also very short. Their final fight IS longer and much more exciting and their never ending blows against each other after theyve exhausted their chakra is very well done. I think its a great fight and it will be incredible once its animated.. Narutos final fight is the manga is against Sasuke. Toneri is from a movie and while that movie IS canon I dont think it counts..

3584337,0,t3_31e7iv, You dont see much of their story and perspective in part . Also keep in mind theyre like  and still childishimmature. By part  they do mature and are more tolerable especially for Sakura. Sasuke does come off as a typical assholeish cool guy rival in the beginning but part  really fleshes out his side of the story and hes easily one of if not the most developed character in the series. He quickly became my favorite in part  People can analyze the fight and pick who they think is stronger but I am very sure Kishimoto wrote it to be that they are equal in strength. However since he gave them different powers and since hes only human it can be argued there is a variance. I think the majority of people who believe there is a difference will say Naruto is stronger. Still sealed inside of Naruto I believe in a dormant state of sleep because of something that happened near the end,Naruto,cq0ucnr,2,t5_2quts

3788360,0,t1_cqnx0n3,Yeah I had a hard time choosing just seven people. In no particular order Itachi Minato Kushina Jiraiya Zabuza and Spoilerss Kaguya were characters that I debated putting on the list. Though now that Ive had time to think about it I might change my list around.  Jiraiya was a tough one for me. Like you I agree that Jiraiya helps to shape Narutos ideology and sets him on thinking about ending the hatred in the world but ultimately Pain beat out Jiraiya on making the list. What it came down to was that even though Jiraiya teaches Naruto about hatred Pain is the one who makes Naruto understand it. Through his actions Pain makes Naruto understand what it really means to hate someone and what effects that hatred has on the world as a whole. And I think that understanding helps Naruto to find his solution to the cycle.  I might lower Hashirama because as crucial as his conversation with Sasuke is the wide majority of his contributions to the story take place in the past.  I do also feel like despite Hagoromos extensive contributions to creating the ninja world his importance is largely in myth and in the farforgotten past and I honestly dont feel like he makes any meaningful contributions to change the progression of the plot or a characters thinking. This was also the reason that Spoilerss Kaguya didnt make the list.

4103483,0,t1_cro04hk,Sorry to disagree...I think Sasuke surely had time to try to stay in touch with Sarada there are so many ways of comunication both by justu or physicalI think he sounded extremely rude to answer a simple question and if it had been expressed differently could have not sounded like such a douch i.e. instead of None of your business he could have said Sorry I cannot share that information with you See how it sounds way more polite and kinda what could come out of a grown up mature person?In your example of Narutos parents even though they have to save the whole village their first focus is always Naruto! As it should be. Naruto always comes first Minato even takes time to get Kushina and Naruto to bed and makes sure they are ok before even thinking of facing the enemy. I know this is all a set up to the story though. Of course we would not have a story otherwise. But I am here to debate as everyone else is. I am sure Sasuke is still to show us his best side as a father in fact Sakura might get kidnapped by a bunch of Oniondudes on her way there... So there will be plenty of oportunities for Sasuke to show us he is the Family figure we want... Trauma or not. ,Naruto,cro0t0v,1,t5_2quts

Adopted kids who grow up in an environment not knowing they are adopted generally have bad reactions when told later in life. Raising adopted kids in an environment where they know they are adopted and that is represented as a great alternative is the more successful strategy.By not telling an adopted child you are creating the assumption that somehow it makes them lesser or that there was some reason to not tell the kid they were adopted because it somehow changes them as a member of the family. Most kids do not take this well because it completely reverses the dynamic they grew up believing and in the modern age we have reached a point where adoption is  accepted and even encouraged and there is no need to hide an identity from a kid.There is no comparison between beating Naruto and Sai calling her ugly.

4320146,0,t3_3agrtr,. Yes.  The way you explained it below seems correct.. Makes sense.  As far as I know there arent really all that many branch members in the Hyuga clan but there are enough to make it seem as though theyre servants to the will of the main branch not in the sense that they have to do the laundry of the main branch but that theyre subject to sacrifice themselves for the main branch.  It also seems as though main branch members that arent the heir are subject to this tradition as well.  Hizashi was branded with the seal even though he was the son of the clan head however Hanabi was not.  I think this has to do with the fact that Hanabi wasnt alive at the time.  I doubt that the explanation that Hanabi is four years Hinatas junior was intended to explain that Hanabi was also protected from the tradition of the caged bird seal because she wasnt born at the time but it seems at least plausible.. I dont think this was ever touched upon during the series... Makes sense though.  May want to consult some of Asias more popular marriage traditions.. I dont think members of the main branch would ever be branded with the caged bird seal even if there was a shortage of branch members.  They seem pretty dead set in their traditions if Hiashis treatment of Hinata was anything to go by.  Besides that it seems that most of the concepts that have come about in fanfiction are just that hypotheticals that just add to the plot device.  I mean most people seem to think that the Hyuga are this diabolical clan that lives the lap of luxury but theyre a ninja clan that favor strength and tradition over anything else.,Naruto,cscly9q,2,t5_2quts

At age  he joins team Minato with the new academy graduates Obito and Rin  At age  he is forced to take the exams with Obito and Rin to form the three man team for him the exam was not for becoming a Chunin but to be a good team guy and he passes that exam too.

4340914,1,t1_csexy7t,Thats not true. Sasuke uses Chidori while standing still often especially in part . Moving faster is an easier way to generate chidori as it lessens the chakra required to start the technique as shown and discussed in part  before Sasuke goes to fight Gaara. It is not essential. This could differ in the Lightning Blade but no sensible reason has been stated as to why the user must move fast if they are already capable of generating it on their own.

4381292,0,t1_csjhca8,You have to remember Obito was . And once he set down the path of darkness laid out by Madara there was no turning back. The kind of psychological scarring that happens at that tender age is something that sticks with you.You say in a later comment we should have an army of Obitos  the whole point of the manga is that we do. The shinobi world creates a cycle of hate. The difference between Obito and everyone else is that Obito has the power and knowledge to attempt the whole Infinite Tsukoyomi ploy. Its not that there arent other people like Obito its that hes a very skilled ninja and played his cards right. Obito is trying to break the system. His warped logic is not that he is taking over the world or even that he wants Rin back but rather that the Shinobi world is inherently broken and the only way to fix it is to get rid of it altogether. To harken back to the TNJ that ended the Obito v Naruto showdown it was the easy path to hokage and as Obito told Kakashi its not about Rin. Its about the principles behind what happened to Rin and the fact that future war is unavoidable with the current shinobi system unless someone changes it.,Naruto,csji9xb,11,t5_2quts

In response to your postJoined Orochimaru but then killed him.I dont recall him attacking Konoha Shinobi on a whim or even killing any of them. I would like a source for this.Itachi was a recognized criminal and threat that was part of Akatsuki. Killing Itachi is in no way a crime in the eyes of the world. Yep he assaulted people of the  nations.Yep Taka joined Akatsuki.Yep attempted to kidnap Bee.Yep asaluted the Kage summit. Goal was to kill Danzo tho but still. Yep he tried to kill is old team.Conspired with Obito but also helped defeat him. Yep he tried to do the revolution thing.Now my own additionHe was responsible for Diedara suicide.He helped Itachi stop Edo Tensei.He used Orochimaru to revive the four Hokages.He fought with the alliance to defeat Obito and Madara.He fought with Team  to save the world against Kaguya.Sasuke did good things and bad things. Thats why hes not a straight up criminal or a bad guy. He walks on the thin line between good and bad. Hes an antiherosemiprotagonist. ,Naruto,csjp785,2,t5_2quts

4450730,0,t1_csrokmt,okay lecture begins first off its good to know sound is simply vibrations. in TFOD dosu  states that he can blow out peoples ear drums he destroyed lees ear drum this takes  decibels and he does it on a miss and quite easily in the same fight he destroys the log trap with the melody arm and one had sign the vibrations needed to explode something like that is about  decibels at this level of decibels the human ear cant hear the sound anymore and it just becomes intense vibrations similar to the shockwave of a very large explosion  ton tnt bomb this intense ability combined with dosus ability to use his chakra to focus all the vibrations straight to the point he wants  i believe he also states this when fighting lee. so he essentially controls shockwaves. also sound waves  travel incredibly long distances until the sound is dispersed to a hz to low for humans to detect and then even less after that dosu again can control the waves and concentrate them where he desires enabling the possibility of mid range assuming as a genin he doesnt have perfect chakra control he would only be able to have weaponised sound up to about ft anything after that and someone like lee would msot likely be fast enough to change location a normal person or someone like sakura would not.  sound waves vibrations travel faster through different mediumsthrough air assuming them temp is degrees F is about  ms through water  is  ms and speed of sound through granite is  ms   many solids the speed changes based on what its going through  traveling through Beryllium sound has a speed of  ms or  feet per second.so if dosu were to put his hand on the ground and use resonating echo drill  the jutsu he uses for most of his attacks in this particular example when he explodes the giant log he could control the vibration that are going . times faster than the speed of sound in air sound in concrete in  ms and basically shake opponents apart from the legs up.,Naruto,csrp7fa,2,t5_2quts

And I think that being stabbed in the back is a perfect way for Madara to die. Its how Hashirama did it back at the Valley of the End. Madara is arrogant and cocky and he doesnt think to watch his back. And symbolically hes someone who didnt believe in entrusting his will to others because he didnt like having people following him.

He almost gives his life to save his friend  and after he survives he sees the girl he loves die from his best friends hand . After that he has to fight his own Sensei and kinda being responsible for his death also he massacres his whole clan probably his grandma also  .

4676899,0,t3_3f06jg,Well in the  seconds he was in the last he wasnt actually fighting. I see no reason why you cant turn off the rinnegan considering Madara showed that he could you can turn it on. Though both obito and nagato didntcouldnt turn it off. But there are explanations for that as well. For one Obito was in a war against the entire world need to be constantly alert. Also nagato was an uzumaki thus had massive amounts of chakra so he could have just chosen to keep it on at all times rather than turn it off and be unprepared. But they could also have not been able to turn it off as it wasnt their eyes ex kakashis sharingan never turning off.Weve seen that you can turn it on at will so i see no reason why you cant turn it off at will if you are the orginal owner of the eye.And as for Sasukes Tomoe it could either have been a kishi fuckup happens frequently in the manga or it could be because he was hopping between kaguyas diemensions and used too much chakra so he could only awaken a normal rinnegan.,Naruto,ctk2lyn,1,t5_2quts

They tend to retain the Japanese for keywords like Jinchuriki and Jutsu or the names of some Kekkei Genkai but will translate things that need to be rendered in English to make sense in context.The English manga tends to use the Japanese then sometimes elaborates using a literal English translation. For example most attack names are repeated in the manga like Chojo Kebutsu! Artifacts of the Buddha!!

4817432,0,t1_cu1p2xw,gt What bothered me is that she took so long to get near to destroying Obitos eyeIts obviously a plot device so Madara can reach a more powerful form in a short amount of time. If you think about it theres absolutely no reason for Sakura to hesitate in that situation. At this point shes an experienced medic who has performed harder surgeries and admitted she neither trusts nor likes Obito so she shouldnt be afraid of hurting him. That scene shouldve played out with Sakura ripping the eye out of the socket while doing as little as possible to ease the pain but as soon as its removed Madara pops in and takes it away from her. However that would take longer to produce so just make her hesitate.,Naruto,cu1rz1o,15,t5_2quts

4992257,0,t3_3jadsx,To be fair Kishi did produce some of the best and most impactful character deaths Ive seen in a story. Jiraiyas was a pretty good take on the student kills the master as was Oro killing the third. Minato and Kushinas deaths were done very well and I liked that they werent shown until later in the storytelling rather than in chronological order at the beginningit gave those deaths a lot of impact for two people who were hardly shown up to that point. But I think one of the best character deaths and twists after the death that Ive ever seen was with Itachi. Just great storytelling. Every one of those characters could be great main characters for their own series and it seems pretty rare for one story to kill off that many impactful characters. Along with Naruto Sasuke Shikamaru and Kakashi I think those were the best characters setting aside Kushina since she was hardly shown in the story when it comes to their abilities and complexities. To kill them off in my mind steers the series away from being one of those with a happy everybody lives ending. Also I dont fault Kishi for keeping so many people alive because theres still a chance he wants to keep the series going in some form and killing off more characters now gives him fewer people to kill off with impact later. If he does continue the story in oneshot movies or books my money would be on Kakashis death being the big death in one and maybe Oro dying in some sort of way that is redeeming ala Obito.I wouldnt have been too surprised if a few more of the Konoha rookie  died during the war like Shino or one of Kiba or Akamaru Id imagine a shot of Akamaru howling over Kiba would have been pretty emotional. The fact that they all survived was more surprising than anything else. Edit I also forgot about another major death that was handled very well Asuma. ,Naruto,cunr4it,15,t5_2quts

Its a redundant point to make. Bijuu Dama had the capabilities of killing him and he had the capabilities of stopping it. gtThen he tried to end it with his extendo swordneck combo but completely failed at even penetrating Narutos Chakra cloak.Not relevant either. Were discussing how Orochimaru wasnt getting crushed or beaten by  Tails Naruto not Orochimarus offensive capabilities. Orochimaru quite simply wasnt losing that battle. As I mentioned in another comment due to lack of ninjutsu there wasnt much chance of him defeating  tails Naruto but similarly  Tails Naruto clearly didnt have much of a chance of killing Orochimaru. Thats the point at hand and all evidence suggests Orochimaru was doing completely fine.

When sasuke gained itachis eyes they turned into the EMS but they just act as sasukes MS that cant go blind and lose the abilities they had previously.

Basically when an eye becomes an EMS it loses its previously abilities and gains the new owners abilities. This is different to when a MS is transplanted to new owner but doesnt become an EMS. In this case it just stays the way it is.

I never liked Orochimaru or Kabuto because I dont like or really understand their motivation but I do feel that he should have gone out with a bigger fight. I think he could have been a cast member for longer but then he would overshadow Kabutos role later on in the story.. I think so because he was much more interested in just killing people for his own goals while the Akatsuki strived for peace to stop all violence.I have a followup question about last weeks reread too Did Gaara also go from genin to hokage too? and ive always wondered are there no jonin or anyone else in the sand who would have been a better kazekage than Gaara?,Naruto,cvo20jk,1,t5_2quts

Its comparable to how raiton inherently overwhelms doton even if they doton user is equally or more skilled than the raitong user.How long he had been a ninja had absolutely nothing to do with his strength when he lost control.

Sasuke was willing to give his life and ambition so that Naruto can grab Sakura and run away from Gaara. Naruto went full Kurama on Pains ass and was willing to give up his soul after seeing Hinata being hurt in front of him in order to kill him. He even said Thank God and cried tears of joy at being told he didnt hurt her after he went into Kurama Berserker Mode.Yeah sure those pairings were onesided and the boys never truly cared about their love interests. And Id rather subtle romances thank you very much.gt All the others were about a girl swooning over a guy for years and finally getting the guy as a prizeThe girls were never trying to initiate a relationship with either them. All the other times are simply them trying to helping the person they love. Theres nothing wrong in that.Actually you could say the girls are the prizes for the boys. Both Naruto and Sasuke were orphans that starved for love but now they are not alone and have their own family. Thats really nice IMO.gt its offensive that girls never grow out of their crushes. Hinata never crushed Naruto. Sakura crushed Sasuke but grew to love him.gt I dislike Hinata most because she simply has no character beyond Naruto.Theres a difference between overcoming your shynessselfesteem issues and literally commanding the largest military body ever assembled. If you cant see that you might have reading comprehension problems. Also props to her for being strong enough to overcome her own pain at seeing her cousin brutally murdered and literally slap the man she loves so that he wont give in to darkness. Her actions there saved thousands of lives.Oh and Hinata also fought alongside Neji and Team  for the entirety of the war.

5859427,0,t3_3vbwgd,I think most of the hate towards Sakura stems from her early treatment of Naruto. The whole abuse is funny when its female on male shtick is outdated and many people find it more annoying than funny. She got better but that initial impression stuck with people.I dont think your assessment of her is completely fair either. She doesnt always screw up. I think another poster phrased it well. Shes a major character with side character level feats. If you look at Sakura objectively shes accomplished more than most characters in the series. She beat Sasori with help. She made an antidote to Sasoris poison when no one in Suna could. She mastered Tsunades Creation Rebirth technique. Its only in comparison to characters like Naruto and Sasuke that she falls short.On the other hand Hinata being a side character doesnt get judged as harshly as Sakura. No one compares her to Naruto or Sasuke they compare her to other side characters.I think your assessment of Hinata is pretty much spot on though. Although I think that people tend to exaggerate her shyness. When Naruto isnt involved she isnt really shy at all. Shes just quite and polite.,Naruto,cxnp7nj,1,t5_2quts

The definition of what a planet is has been changes a few times so its gets convoluted and there is no  way to define a planet. If Ganymede was going around the sun it would be definitely considered a planet the moon is a rather small body in the Solar System but if it was around the sun it would be a Dwarf Planet its only called a moon because its orbiting the Earth. If the definition of a planet is basically either going around the sun or goin around a body in the Sol System there there isnt much of a definition of a planet.

6104247,0,t1_cyjhff8,Im sure it would.  Most of the reasoning for how people feel about Tsunade is that shes useless as a leader for two reasons.  She didnt fight to protect the village during an invasionraidattack of that magnitude something every single one of her predecessors has done and she bases literally her entire standing as a leader on what Naruto wants to do.  Shes arguably the weakest leader next to Hiruzen somebody who didnt have the balls to really call his own shots and let people walk all over him.  I like both of them but theyre some pretty bad leaders.  She basically let Sasuke dick around with a world class criminal WHO KILLED HER FUCKING MENTOR AND THE PREVIOUS HOKAGE!!! because Naruto said hed handle it.  And look how long it took him to handle it.  Amazing leadership.Thats why I have some respect for Danzo and find him to be such an interesting character.  He may be a dick but hes got some balls no pun intended.  Tobirama is the same way without all the baggage of what he did to other people that screwed them over and is why I like him too.  Theyre not scared to piss people off because theyre duty as a leader isnt to be loved by all.  Its to call the shots.,Naruto,cyjho7t,2,t5_2quts

6122144,0,t3_3zd0og,Great post agreed. Heres my thoughts. Would love to see as you said the series toned down a bit. It would be a tragedy if Boruto just attempted to emulate Naruto as a series i.e. chosen ninja rising up to save the world from certain destruction especially since as long as Sasuke and Naruto are around its an unrealistic scenario.. I want to focus more on the traininggrowing aspect that we dont get as much of in Naruto. I think its more important for this to branch off in completely different directions from the original series so it doesnt get stale.. Although its called Boruto Id love to see more focus on other characters. By the end of Naruto it was pretty much all Naruto and Sasuke and the rest of the characters were truly a sideshow. Id like to see them brought back to the forefront and go back to more of the teammission aspects.,Naruto,cylivkz,2,t5_2quts

First of all hed underestimate them and hold back which is their greatest advantage. Orochimaru and Tsunade are virtually immortal in combat so I think they would survive the fight at least. Having the worlds best medical ninja on their team also increases their chances quite a bit. Nagato said Jiraiya wouldve beaten him if he knew the secret to his Six Paths of Pain and Jiraiya wasnt even in his prime. Nagato with the Rinnegan is arguably stronger than pre VotE Madara so I think that gives Jiraiya credibility. Imo their best bet would be to create an opening for Tsunade perhaps Orochimaru could paralyze him with his true forms blood. Without his regeneration one direct hit from her would seriously injure or even kill him. If not it would still give them a window for a followup attack.,Naruto,cyz0akc,3,t5_2quts

The Last about Naruto and Hinata and Boruto about Narutos son Sasuke and Naruto being bad ass and so on. There will be a new monthly manga about Boruto which will start in Spring and a new Itachi anime taking place before the Uchiha massacre.

6304941,0,t3_41yztz,Madara has the EMS and he unlocked the Rinnegan right before his death. The Rinnegan is the natural progression of the Sharingan when Uchiha and Senju DNA is combined. So his Rinnegan are just his EMS but further to the next level. So one can assume that he still has access to his Sharingan techniques even with the Rinnegan. Kishi never explains this explicity. Madara never uses the other MS techniques Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu even with the EMS and Sasuke has the Tomoe Rinnegan in one eye and the EMS in the other so he cannot be used as a reference. We can only assume that progression from EMS to Rinnegan does not mean he cannot perform EMS techniques while using his Rinnegan.,Naruto,cz6aupe,-1,t5_2quts

6346706,0,t1_czarbyl,Fullmetal Alchemist is definetly unique. It deserves the number one spot on My Anime List so its hard to find something to replace it. Something that the two of you might enjoy is Code Geass or Steins Gate Theyre both very popular series with both the female and male public. If youre looking for something to watch with your wife in the same direction as FMA id definetly go with one of these two.However since youre planning to watch with your wife I cant help but also recommend Clannad  Especially the sequel Clannad After Story The first season Clannad might be a bit boring for the two of you since its just a high school drama HOWEVER once you finished Clannad and can move on to Clannad After Story that will change. After Story is about the two main characterss life together after school and boy it will make your wife cry like she has never before. I swear sitting through Clannad is more than worth it once you get to After Story.Another show I can recommend is Usagi Drop Its a simple heartwarming show about a man who adopts a child.Hope youll find something you like!,Naruto,czb1td6,1,t5_2quts

For all the the Chunin exams Naruto is kinda thinking somewhere in his mind that he could beat Orochimaru and such. Then when The Third fights him you get to see how much more incredible they are. Sure they likely couldnt take adult or teenage Naruto or Sasuke sure theyd make the fight last longer for cinematics but thats all compared to the kid version its such a huge gap. But the thing is that you then see Naruto and Sasuke and Sakura get so powerful. I wonder how far theyll take it with the new Boruto series.

6914430,0,t1_d101v5l,I get where youre saying but I think it showed enough failures. People talk about Talknojutsu a lot but forget the actions that proceed the talking. Naruto had to fight his hardest to convince Neji Gaaraand Tsunade it wasnt through words alone. And it was mostly though the combination of the fighting and his words that convinced those around him he was serious. As for failures I think thats what Sasuke was implemented for it took years of fighting and multiple failures to finally convince Sasuke. Theres also Haku the one who originally taught him this creed that he couldnt save.  The war also played a major role in that as I believe it also served as the largest test for Narutos ideals. There where times then where it even looked like hed give up if it wasnt for his friends and even though he succeeded overall in the end they lost a lot of people he couldnt save. The Reanimation jutsu did a great job of highlighting that too. The scene at the end of the manga with the funeral was one of the most important and I feel like most people just skimmed past and cared more about the pairings.,Naruto,d102mzf,2,t5_2quts
6915553,0,t1_d106pq0,Oh well I guess its probably the last one. I always wondered because of the fact that the entire conflict with Neji and Hinata is built from the fact that Hizashi was put into the branch side.Never quite made sense to me. Theres another situation that always made me wonder but I guess I should probably wait a bit before making a thread for that.Well since youre here...When watching The Land of Waves Arc did it ever strike you as bizarre that Zabuza announced his presence the way he did. I mean sure he threw his sword. But that seemed to be a token attempt at killing Team  anyways.He makes this grand entrance which ruins any chance at surprise and then proceeds to try and assassinate Kakashi.Seems like a very poor plan for a master of Silent Killing.He could have done almost anything else and it would have made for a better plan. He should have tried assassinating Kakashi in the mist right from the start. Kakashi wouldnt know that he was coming and hed have the element of surprise.He could have set a trap or a bomb.He could have used some kind of decoy to separate Kakashi and the genin in some way. He could have waited until the environment favored him even more like say when Kakashis team are on the boat. There Kakashi would have to worry about genin who cant water walk an old man who cant water walk and the boat driver. All of this against someone who specializes in water ninjutsu.He had all those options... and he chose to announce his presence and then try assassinate his opponent.Did that ever cross your mind?,Naruto,d1078io,2,t5_2quts

Let me rephrase myself. Tsunade would win against kakashi because nothing kakashi has can take tsunade down in the long run. So while i think it would take a long time before tsunade lands a hit most likely because kakashi is exhausted at this point one hit and hes dead. My point is if tsunade gets better at taijutsu she would most likely win that same fight in a few minutes force a mistake from her opponent and then just blow their heads of with one precise punch.,Naruto,d1atq2v,1,t5_2quts

If we go deeper it was in fact silly for Itachi to implant Amaterasu in Sasuke eyes cause if it had failed which it did the only explanation of why Sasuke cast black flames was because his brother was protecting him something that Itachi never wanted Sasuke to find out about.

As edoNagato they were distracted as Itachi was freeing Bee and Naruto and he took that time to launch it. It may have been quicker because he did have unlimited chakra reserves and he was brought back to full health by absorbing bee.Alot of people disagree but I think Itachi v Nagato is closer to a draw despite Nagatos huge power advantage.

I dont want them nearly as involved as this implies. I have seen more negatives than positives in taking a arguably satisfied conclusion to a heros journey for a beloved character then killing him in a sequel in mangaanime. I do think they will be surpassed but killed? Maybe at most. I do hope someone dies and I definitely hope no take backs. I will see how the story progresses and I too hope the art style involves into a more comfortable design.

7892280,1,t3_4ndrnw,This subreddit is a bunch of white knights when the girls fights for the guy she likes everybody loses their shit. The sole reason Naruto and Sakura never gave up on him was because they knew he was not the real Sasuke the grew up with. They both fought through everything to get him back.Sakura loves Sasuke she fought to get him back and succeed.The reason Sasuke is not in the village is because he is aware of what Kaguya said. Basically she wanted to crete an army of white Zetsus to fight off the other people coming for her. If she was scared even after absorbing all the chakra in the world you can imagen how powerful they are. Sasuke realized it and during Gaiden the reason he left was because of this he wanted to gain information on those following Kaguya. At the point Sasuke assumed Itachis role of protecting the village from the shadows which is what he described as a true hero. Sasuke was sacrificing himself and his family in order to protect the village and the world. As we saw there were two of those dudes in Boruto the Movie and they were able to defeat them thanks to the information Sasuke gathered. There is still one more left tho if you considered that in the Kaguyas filler  people are shown not two.So why Sasuke and not Naruto? Well Naruto was going to become Hokage and needed to be in the village besides Sasuke was the only one with the Rinnegan meaning having the ability to go to other dimensions and investigate there again this is show in Gaiden when he did not have the tomoe over his rinnegan because his eye power was weakened for having low chakra because of the dimensional jumps.All explained in GaidenEDITChris Brown amp Rihanna  Stockholm SyndromeThis is what i mean by white knights. Yes Im totaly forgetting how Sasuke forced Sakura to marry him and have his childrenright? as a matter of fact Sasuke asked Sakura countless of times to stop following him because he knew what was awaiting for her. Example Sasuke leaving the village when a child and saying thank you to her. Sasuke leaving the village when they were teenagers and telling Sakura that his sins had nothing to do with her and she should not pay for it.

7918527,0,t1_d463dg6, Suigetsus brother does play out slightly.  He is one of the revived swordsmen in the war.  However he was one of the ones missing a sword.  Most people assume that he uses Chojuros sword mainly though he mastered all .  He fought with his fingers instead and was whipping ass. Youre saying that Nagato could be the Child of Prophecy but he already is.  At the end of the fight with Nagato when Naruto convinces him to bring the people back the Old Toad Sage said that he never expected there to be two childs of prophecy.  So youre already right he is one and Naruto is the other. The only thing I dont really like about Itachi saying there were  Mangekyo users is that we find out later that is false.  And its not the fact that Obito is pretending to be Madara.  Shisui was never included.  So even if we were to exclude Madara it should be .  Which means Kishi didnt think that one through.  But as far as the whole he was always good thing I dont really see a problem with it.  Some think its a retcon Kishi said it was that way from the beginning it is what it is. Youre misinterpreting what Itachi meant with we are each others spares.  What he is saying is that my eyes are spare for yours yours are spare for mine but one of us is going to lose.  Basically its you or me.  They cant both do it hes saying theres gonna be a winner and loser but that either side has potential to be the winner.

Now Naruto was able to break out of it with  tails but Nagatos solution was to just make it bigger. Having learned from that experience whats to say he doesnt decide to factor in the kyuubis strength now? Speed is useful but it does not mean he will be moving at said speed for the entire time. These guys have several linked pairs of rinnegan I believe theyd see his movements.The Pains have short and long range abilities high destructive capacity animal path for essentially infinite summons even after the summons die a KO move by touch restricting rods and invulnerability to chakra attacks if they fight as a team. How exactly would Minato speed around and oneshot everyone? Is this assuming they are all marked? Assuming he wont get caught like KCM Naruto by the invisible chameleon summon? To mark them he has to actually go up to them and touch them which could prove fatal. Get caught by preta path game. Get caught by human path game. Get caught by animal path game. Its kind of silly to think Minato just wont be able to be touched but he can for sure tag everyone else. If that were the case all fast characters are untouchable and this fight is pointlessonesided. ,Naruto,d4vgd79,1,t5_2quts

8203747,0,t1_d52ylt0,gtAgree? Disagree? Why?Read my words and then respond to them. Youre actively trying to ask me questions or change my argument so you can create a strawman to respond to.gtIt can disprove ANY?The manga shows the facts which would disprove any hyperbole. Not hard.gtMight be due to lax wording but youre wrong about CM never happened. CM happened in the genjutsu  not debatable. Oh and shall I mention that intense yell he let out? Does it remind you of something?  Oh what a coincidence Sasuke breaks out right after that!LOVE how youre trying to argue semantics. Now youre saying Sasuke broke out of the tsukuyomi due to CM which is the same as Naruto surging chakra...but before you said once again Im not saying CM trans  surging chakra not the point So whats your point? The DB says nothing about CM because CM never happened IN REALITY.gtThat aside. Why dont you explain to me the purpose of Sasuke going CM in the genjutsu?For sure buddy. Itachi seemingly had a clone holding Sasuke down. He went into CM second state so he could create snakes out of his back that pierce through the clone incapacitating it. He successfully did this within the genjutsu. He then overcomes the genjutsu with his sharingan like the DB and manga say. Normal people realize it was a genjutsu and nothing within it happened. That is why Sasuke still has his fucking eye.gtHow did Tobi survive Sasukes Amaterasu?Heres the information we have on this topic Tobi got hit with amaterasu directly he falls into the shadows and emerges just fine. This means we know he got out of that lethal situation. This is all the info we know and thats all one can say. gtIt CAN IT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO BOTH PARTIES. Explain to me why it cantgtgtgtgtSee you cant say it was also due to something else because it doesnt explicitly state that something else. That means the burden of proof is on you to show that that something else should be included. Otherwise I could say the DB didnt state that tsukuyomi wasnt broken due to Naruto and Sakuras amazing friendship and love for Sasuke. Because they didnt explicitly state this I am victorious because my logical logicz are the most logicalliestest of all!I finally found the logical fallacy youre usingappeal to ignorance in which ignorance represents a lack of contrary evidence is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or vice versa. This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes a third option which is that there may have been an insufficient investigation and therefore there is insufficient information to prove the proposition be either true or false. In debates appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the burden of proof.Bolding the important parts. What this means is youre saying that the statement Sasuke defeats MS due to his own skill should also explicitly state everything in the entire universe that it is not due to because if it does not do this anything else that it fails to state is in fact true and I can apply it. Further simplified if I say my foot hurts because I kicked a wall going by your logic you then could say my foot hurts due to me being an alien from Mars. Because my statement doesnt say me being an alien from Mars is not the reason my foot hurts you think this is a valid claim.Down to the last important bit. You are using this fallacy to shift the burden of proof due to lack of evidence on your side. You dont have anything concrete to prove to me Itachi weakened tsukuyomi everything points toward you being wrong so you want to use this fallacy to state ridiculous things then ask me for proof. Im so glad I found this it perfectly outlines and destroys everything youve been doing.gtIf you had a strong logical backing to it.You dont. Thats just it. Youre no different to the friendship comment. I like how you randomly linked the Sasuke panel because in your head the more manga scans are in my post the more right I am.gtIs the ONLY relevant or necessary to make the statement true? Does it change anything about your statement?This wouldnt be more transparent if youd simply written I literally just changed your statement.

8267247,0,t3_4sosjn,Im just answering the extra question because Danzo stomps this shit.No hes not justified in going as overboard as he did.  Yes he had a point.  For example he tried his hardest to keep Naruto out of the Leaf when Pain attacked.  Yes there were ulterior motives on top of it but it is undeniable that Tsunades side of the argument let Naruto come got him captured.  The only reason he wasnt was Minato saving the day otherwise Tsunade would have completely lost the argument and the world would be doomed.  And based on that and some other things you could argue that Danzo would be better as a leader over somebody who rules solely on her emotions for Naruto even though more people would definitely be sacrificed under him.  Somebody who will gamble with a walking nuke and who failed the gamble until somebody clutched it for her based on pure emotion may not be the best leader.

Danzo also didnt have a counter and managed just fine if anything the counter is just ripping out Shisuis eyes and if Danzo could do it then so could Itachi.Yeah youre right. Shisui wont use kotoamatsukami because Itachi will just rip out Shisuis eye and that will be it. Solo King Itachi at it again! Naruto isnt ABC logic A beat B and B beats C so A beats C. People have different abilities  so just using ABC logic isnt going to work.Itachi has no counter to koto so when it is used GG.gtThats still being able to control someone and Itachi says able not guaranteed.Yeah the genjutsu is able to CONTROL not slightly influence. This is what I am pointing out. Dont pretend to be dense with these things.DB on Koto  Wish there was a better translation but obviously one can get the main point.,Naruto,d5co99i,1,t5_2quts

It was a reasonable guess that only someone with the Sages abilities could read it. Reading the tablet was the motive behind Madara attempting Rinnegan.The original instruction of the tablet was for someone who awakened the RInnegan and the instruction was basically One person becoming too powerful is dangerous. Instead opposing forces should collaborate and find peace. This was meant to discourage a Rinneganuser from further hubris.However Zetsu modified the tablet to say A Rinnegan User must cast Infinite Tsukyomi. Heres the process. ,Naruto,d5n897u,2,t5_2quts

8380803,0,t1_d5p31fw,I disagree with you saying Minatos kunai speed or even an average kunai speed is slower than Onokis fly speed. gt What evidence do you have for him having fast kunai?. When Minato first entered the battle field in the th war it was from a kunai throw. He was able to teleport the  tails tailed beast bomb away and join forces with Naruto by using FTG on his kunai before anyone could even react he was there. . Minato vs Raikage. Right before Raikage charged at Minato Minato was able to lob up a kunai that he would teleport to in order to get the counter attack. He lobbed that kunai before Ay could even realize it was there. This doesnt really indicate his kunai speed per say but it shows Minatos fast reaction speed when it comes to kunais. If raikage cant react fast enough to Minatos kunai Onoki sure cant. . This isnt really Minatos kunais throw but when Rock Lee threw the FTG kunai when  gates Guy was charging at Madara. Minato was able to intercept and teleport the truth seeking balls away with him before it hit Guy charging right at it. Minatos entire fighting style revolves around Kunais so its safe to assume Minatos throw would have done the same thing. The only reason Minato didnt throw the kunai himself is because he didnt have arms at the time otherwise he would have done it himself like he even stated himself. . His entire style of fighting is based around kunai throwing FTG and raw speed. To say that his kunai speed isnt fast just defeats the purpose of using kunais at all. If his kunai throw is slower than his raw speed why would he even use kunais.And this isnt even considering the fact that Minato can use Toad summons who are known to be able to jump extremely farhigh. Unless youre going to argue that Onoki is faster than toad summons as well I dont see how Minato cant get to Onoki. Toad summon  kunai throwing Minato can easily get to Onoki. ,Naruto,d5p5dbz,11,t5_2quts

Naturally one could see him as destined to either save the world or destroy it with it seeming that he was going to walk down the latter path in his attempts at the former. However if Kishimoto had used this as a chance to revisit Narutos battle against Neji he would have written out a situation where fates embodiment would come into conflict with a young man who once more would represent the power of free will.

No but if she definitely did not progress if she cant talk properly to the one she wants to marry since she was like .Her fixing her clan issues was only a minor segment of her entire character.

8898593,0,t3_524y03, On the topic of pacing it was definitely pretty bad in that arc.  The chapter where they finally see Sasuke again was just full of Naruto tripping sweating running tripping again stare into the sky etc.  It was like Kishimoto was trying his hardest to end the chapter with Sasuke.  Pretty obvious why since seeing Sasuke for the first time in  years both in story and in real life is a big deal.  But it was considerably drawn out to end the chapter without Sasuke saying a word as a cliffhanger and the fact that it was kind of annoying to see in the reread means it was probably  times worse when it came out.  Those type of endings where it is drawn out for the cliffhanger annoy me personally.  Theres a difference between a cliffhanger in motion and a cliffhanger that was clearly forced. I actually dont really have a problem with the designs.  Sai looks gay as shit dont get me wrong.  But Im a One Piece fan weird designs dont bother me.  Everybody in One Piece is weird lol.  As long as the character is ok their face could look like a foot for all I care.  Now Id hope for cool panels with them or something like if they get serious Sais serious face comes to mind but what they wear or whatever doesnt bother me.  On the other hand I think both of them were a wasted opportunity for more characterization.  To piggy back off of that both had room to be very impactful to the story.  Sais Root training considering how much hype they gave Danzo seemed like it would play hugely into the story then Sasuke attacked and its impossible for Sasuke to lose.  And Yamato seemed like he would be a large part of this too considering he was working directly under Tsunades orders while Sai worked directly under Danzos the two of them butting heads.  They could have worked in a pretty large confrontation or back and forth espionage type thing with both of them which would have been pretty cool since overall for a hired mercenary series there really isnt that much spying or trading secrets going on.And its weird because Kishimoto has gone on record saying he made Sai with the intention of him being popular.  I guess a bunch of penis jokes was his idea of how to make a popular character dont know why.  And I guess once that arc was over he gave up on it and more or less sidelined him.  He seemed surprised that Sai wasnt more popular which I dont get how he would be confused boy toy with the cut off shirt isnt an automatic popular character.  But Sai could have been pretty cool imo. I wouldnt say the plot was useless but it was like a step above useless.  It did give us proper introduction to the third faction in this Akatsuki battle which is Orochimaru and his crew.  We learn that Orochimaru has his own shit and he wants the Leaf to take out the Akatsuki for him.  Kind of a give and take.  And we learn about Danzo and how hes playing everybody for the fool because hes doing his own thing which I guess you could call that faction .  Only problem is that neither of these factions get much importance later on.  Its an unimportant arc in hindsight but thats just hindsight.  We didnt get enough to justify the whole thing especially since it was a lot of character regression for both Naruto and Sakura Naruto being increasingly less mature in serious situations and Sakura just crying but those two things are very important in theory.  In practice they end up being useless obviously.I noticed you didnt put any pros which I disagree with since its basing on more of hindsight and less of looking at it as a contained arc.  Like I said I think the Danzo introduction to his storyline was excellent.  Danzo fronted on Tsunade in front of her own student.  And with the Danzo storyline comes Sai and Root which was also very good.  Root seemed x time competent than the Anbu and that brainwashed loyalist storyline was also great because thats exactly what ninja are technically supposed to be.  Tools.  Now Kakashi himself disagreed back in the Wave Arc but that was his personal opinion rather than the definition.  And we get Sai starting to debate with himself over the definition of what a shinobi is which was also pretty cool set up.  And we also get introduction to our newer faction Orochimaru being his own entity that is playing both sides to a degree.  Also cool set up that Sasuke kills off eventually but for the arc itself it was pretty good.Now these arcs all fall through.  But thats hindsight in terms of introducing those storylines it was pretty good imo.  I still give the arc like a  because besides that stuff there was a lot of pretty annoying things.  But that introduction to what was seemingly a brewing civil war between Danzo and Tsunade which would have been godly assuming its done right considering how much hype it ended up getting and Orochimaru playing both sides kinda cool but not nearly as big as the first one were cool in their own right.,Naruto,d7hhewt,3,t5_2quts

The original Naruto series only had  episodes. idk where youre getting ish episodes.The release date for episode  was Febuary th  Shippuden aired on Febuary th  so it wasnt a year. There was a filler arc in Shippuden where they were on a boat and that arc was from episode . There might have been a movie where he was on a boat or it could have been an OVA or fan made thing.Idk what you were watching if you can vividly remember that but it wasnt Naruto,Naruto,d8qwgcu,4,t5_2quts

9437310,0,t1_d9c4hu1,A fully controlled Rinnegan could be extremely powerful. Six hands with rockets and chakra absorption shinra tensei and bansho tennin to control the flow of the battle and chibaku tensei spams mean that Sasuke could be a huge beast. Personal theory of mine Sasuke should have more than a complete susanoo his rinnegan should enhance it. Of course Naruto if he called on the tailed beasts to give him chakra that plus the full extent of kurama along with sage mode and gadoudama infused in his attacks thats a beast as well. So both of them had things they could and couldnt do at the time which resulted in the fight we saw no point arguing about it.To answer OPs question IMO Naruto could destroy Tobirama Sarutobi Kakashi and Tsunade vAll maybe minato but thats really pushing it. I think that he has a strong edge over Hashirama due to God hax the wood style is really powerful as we see him dumpstering Madara all day as uNamikazeEU said. However I dont see him taking on Sage Mode Kurama. That six armed three headed powerhouse literally looks like a lot of the Hindu gods. He could hold out against Six Paths Madara but not full Juubi absorbed. In any case that madara would be the clear winner and this is why Kaguya was introduced. Considering that Naruto The Last Spoilers  s Naruto solos a moon buster with half his power since he split his power with Kurama so he could take out the golem  he is definitely a shinobi world buster maybe a planet buster.,Naruto,d9c8ua1,1,t5_2quts

9463443,0,t3_5ab6o0,Welcome to Plot Convenience the Volume...Anyways I also rewatched the Road to Ninja movie since this volume also had that extra  Special which served as a small setup to the movie it helped a bit in balancing out the bad aftertaste of this volume.Also in case anyone missed it but still want to read it my wall of text for the last reread is up.So lets get started... of Chapter Itachi is really starting to annoy me with his newfound crush on Naruto I guess its romantic since its like... love from beyond the grave or something... but this is like the third time Itachi longingly thinks about his Messiah.And ah yes... Oonoki is the one who is giving the big pep talk to the other Kage... yknow the guy whos mega old already exhausted himself a few times over and even got dirty when he was caught in a giant explosion... yep obviously hes the one who still has the most energy and motivation!But I guess its at least as hilarious as it is pathetic when the Kage assemble once more only to be stared down by a small army of Susanoo.Madara just wrecking the Kage and pummel them into the ground is of course really statisfying and him beginning to summon his Mechas final form is of course kind of epic as well.And I will admit that the multi layered attack of the Kage which leaves Madara in a looseloose situation is kind of cool and impressive and its such a good thing they are so talented in improvising since they never really fought together before... so it makes sense they have this perfect synergy.Still Madara saves this chapter and makes it enjoyable.Chapter Just look at Madara!Simply drawing the phase saber of his Giant EvaGundam Perfecto Formo levels entire mountains and cuts off the top of others in the distance... hes a god on the battlefield.And I love how Madara boast in such a humble way Oh since its just me the maps only have to be redrawn so muchI mean sure... for the sake of consistency I could bemoan the ridiculous power inflation as usual... but as Ive stated many times before weve long passed the point after which anything goes really... and its still damn epic and weve seen Sasukes Susanoo evolve many times it makes sense there has to be some kind of final form.Oh yeah and Itachi ends Edo Tensei and Sasuke has a few things to talk about but its really nothing we havent heard before... for Madara for the rest overall for this chapter.Chapter Oh look its Danzo again! We did already know that Danzo was somehow involved in the Uchiha Massacre but now we see that Hiruzen was actually against the whole idea and Danzo kind of acted on his own and put Itachi into this bad situation.Oh that Danzo rascal! Kishi really wants to make sure we understand that all of Konohas evil are tied to this one person I guess... too bad hes already dead and wasnt brought back as an Edo or whatever.And well... I admit I really like the last page actually instead of flicking Sasukes forehead as usual he instead reaches around puts his head against his eye to eye and says that he loves his little brother... thats actually really sweet.Good job Kishi.Chapter Oh dont worry Im not going soft on the manga in fact from here on out its pretty much rantmode.So first of all... what exactly was even the point of bringing Dan back as an Edo Tensei when he at no point actually met Tsunade before Edo Tensei was dispelled? Why did Kishi decide it would be a great idea to just keep him sealed inside this barrier?We know Kishi didnt forget about Dan weve seen a tiny bit of him here and there... but its like he couldnt find the right opportunity to let them meet up.So because of that Dan now has THE most convenient Jutsu possible for this situation.A Jutsu that we have never heard of or seen before a Jutsu that allows him to squeeze out a bit of extra time from Edo Tensei because he can control his own soul in spirit form... a Jutsu that allows him to travel vast distances in almost an instant... a Jutsu that allows him to possess other peoples bodies... a Jutsu that allows him to transfer his chakra to someone else and completly rejuvenate them...Such BS... just... wow Kishi...But wait theres more!Because not only has Dan this most convenient Jutsu imaginable... he also has ABSOLUTE PERFECT timing!You see... Tsunades regeneration which she relied on so heavily and boasted about just ran out of juice leaving Tsunade extremly exhausted and vulnerable in fact she already lost conscious when Madara launched a new attack at her which mightve killed her...But JUST THEN Dan arrives takes over Tsunades body has some last words for her and uses a Full Restore on her so shes back in perfect shape even her Chakra diamond thingy is back.And I just want to put a bit of spotlight on Tsunade running out of chakra here... Tsunade boasted so much about her ultimate technique and was incredibly reckless even her own enemy she was fighting called her out for being foolish and putting her own team at risk! If it wasnt for Dan which she couldve no knowledge of she wouldve been out of the battle and the Kage were down to four and lacked a Medic to treat any smaller injuries...Just imagine for a second Itachi did not end Edo Tensei... or Sasuke wouldve been like Before you end the technique you promised to talk. or Itachi wouldve waited even  seconds longer to dispell it or Sasuke had distracted him and he missed a seal... or what if Choujis father was skeptical about lowering the barrier...But no... everything aligned up perfectly for Dan to be just in time to save Tsunade and bail her out from her own stupidity once again.Really the ONLY good thing about this chapter was that Madara is badass enough to recast Edo Tensei on himself.Chapter I can actually really relate to Madara here he already played one of his trump cards but then the battle was interrupted and now its just not the same anymore its just awkward to be like So where did we leave off? and go back into battle... I wouldve lost interest as well.But never mind that because we have some more BS convenience to go around!So... now we learn from Obito that he couldve always just used the piece of the Hachibis leg that Sasuke brought in and Kinkaku and Ginkaku as substitutes for the real HachibiKyuubi... Even just a piece possesses the same power... Like... what?So what was the point of this entire war?Why didnt you just trade with Kabuto for Kinkaku and Ginkaku as soon as you saw he had them in his arsenal of Edo Zombies?You couldve completed the Mazou ages ago!The entire protect Naruto and Bee was absolutely pointless the Shinobi Alliance basically lost before the war even started...In fact letting the war heat up put your entire plan at risk.This is just SO convenient!Chapter But wait! THERES MORE!So Sasuke had a few moments of introspection and right after that Suigetu and Juugo arrive and hand him over a scroll of Plot Convenience that conveniently shows him how to somehow resurrect Orochimaru with Ankos seal who conveniently is still alive and just laying there on the ground.And about Orochimarus resurrection... it makes NO SENSE!So... what exactly is happening here?Does Sasuke resurrect the dead Orochimaru? Does he free Orochimaru somehow? Is this the same Orochimaru that Kabuto juiced and injected into himself? Is this the Orochimaru that was in Sasukes body and was sealed away by Itachis Susanoo? Or is this an entirely new Orochimaru?So what if Kabutos cells had indeed taken over Kabutos body which apperantly was a possibility... what if Orochimaru had taken over Sasukes body? What if someone uses this weird little ritual on Ankos seal while Orochimaru was already alive? Could there be multiple Orochimaru walking the earth?Would they for some reason share a hivemind? They must because this Orochimaru has perfect knowledge about everything that happened... maybe Orochimaru has like a backup of his mind saved to the cloud?Oh but whats that? This Orochimaru was able to observe everything through Ankos seal even when Anko was unconscious? Well isnt that convinient!So could he always do that? Was Anko secretly an unwilling spy for Orochimaru? What about Sasuke who had the exact same seal? Oh wait is this the Orochimaru who was sealed away by Itachi but was able to see the real world through Ankos seal while inside that dream world and he now uses Ankos seal as an escape route? Well that wasnt explained in the manga I just made that up.Also what kind of body is this? Isnt Orochimarus real body a giant snake made of snakes? Or is this a new body thats just a regular human body? Not playing Goauld?Oh and his arms do work even though Suigetsu thought they maybe wouldnt... yeah thats weird why would Suigetsu even think that Orochimarus arm have been fine ever since he transfered years ago...Also Orochimaru takes the time to apperantly absorb the cells or chakra Kabuto got from his old body so... why not use that as an explaination?Make it so that this Orochimaru is a new being with none of the memories of the original Orochimaru but once he absorbs the cellschakra in Kabuto it is transfered to him? Makes just as much sense as everything else here.Whatever lets move on.,Naruto,d9fk3j3,2,t5_2quts

9518576,0,t1_d9l5ibh,Wouldve been a neat callback especially since at that point in the series the Akatsuki had been the leading threat for so long and wed recently lost so many of them. And at that point in time we wouldnt know that we were going to get our reunion with the Edo Tensei. Could probably tie their being summoned to those rings they all wore of which the relevance was never elaborated and which would be better than that plot thread of the bodies coming from redheaded people who inspired characters in Jiraiyas books which was never followed through with.As far as the choices go Ive got a vague comprehension that the six paths of pain are based on the reincarnation cycles of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.Cant use Tobi Zetsu Nagato Konan or Kisame at this point because theyre all still alive. Cant use Sasori because his body is being used as a puppet by Kankurou.So God Path would be Yahiko simply because he was very important to Nagato because of their past what he sacrificed and since he was the father of the original Akatsuki.Demon Path for Kakuzu because I can imagine him sprouting weaponry from his body and firing beams as it is similar to his own ability. Would be a natch for Sasori but if the Invasion of Pain arc panned out similarly it would make sense for it to be Kakuzu because of the way Demon Path is taken out but reactivates to tank another Raikiri for God Path and activates again to fire some missiles at Chouji and Chouza. Could say the stipulation of taking out all his hearts was still in effect.Hell Path goes to Hidan as the King of Hell summoned by Hell Path could easily be interpreted as Lord Jashin. In addition Id like to point out that Hidan worshiped a God that preached the dogma of shared pain and Nagatos solution to violence was to create a weapon that would be shared amongst the people which would cause such misery and fear that people would be scared into inaction for lengths of time creating the closest thing he could think of to realistic sustainable peace. This lines up with Hidans philosophy of shared pain and in life he might have seen Pain as a vessel through which Lord Jashin was operating.Hunger Path goes to Orochimaru because as I recall the Hunger Path went to those who were greedy and unsatisfied in life. They were reincarnated into bodies of water with holes so that no matter how much water flowed into them they would never feel complete. This coincides with Orochimarus insatiable desire for further knowledge and power and his desire for immortality based on the fact that he can never be satisfied with what he has and so he must always be able to hunt for more. Also I can imagine him unlocking his jaw to open his mouth reeeealy wide to devour chakra.Animal Path goes to Deidara since he summoned a variety of animalthemed clay bombs in life and the theme somewhat carries. I also thought he might be the original Animal Path on my first read because of the visual similarity couldnt see the red hair in the black and white manga and because that was the first Path to be introduced Other than God Path so I thought this was the direction they were going to take. Im sorry it wasnt. I think it would be cool for him to be Human Path because he could suck out human souls with his mouthhands then. But I cant imagine Itachi being Animal Path unless the only animals involved were crows.Itachi gets Human Path because he was probably the most fleshedout member of the Akatsuki whose ideals vulnerabilities strengths and weaknesses resonated with so many human readers!

Kabuto was stated back then to be on kakashis level and stated by tsunade to be a medical genius. Tsunade is only known for her brute strength and fast healing. Kakashi loses his raikiri as without the sharingan he cant see tsunades counter. Regardless kakashi is also on jounin level. Tsunade was made sannin for her skills in taijutsu and medical ninjutsu. Kakashi knows  jutsus. We never see him use it in the war but even without the sharingan he still knows those copy jutsus. Hes weaker than orochimaru whom was slightly stronger than old man sarutobi. So that means hes weaker than hiruzen but smarter and more skilled than tsunade. His father was of a status on par with the sannin. Orochimaru and Jiraiya were the strongest of the Sannin. Tsunade is only jounin level. The first two are kage. Kakashi is jounin level as well but he was also a top anbu commander. Without the sharingan hes still a prodigy. Remember him before obito died? He made chunin or jounin or something at a young age. Id say tsunade is the weakest.  Kakashi also knows rasengan which can replace raikiri.,Naruto,daum2c0,-1,t5_2quts
9876618,0,t3_5gtb48,Romance as a Genre isnt included in the Story which gives Kishimoto more room to play around RelationshipsMarriages. IF Romance was included in the Story then he would have to prove the relationship with development that justify the relationship. However that wasnt the case and the audience shouldnt take romance as a part of Story or start to argue about it. You watched Naruto because of the Shonenpart and not about the relationships but i can understand your opinion  and feel somehow the sameThe first Question for me Was Sasuke really needed to be a villain ? Sasuke wasnt a villain in Naruto he played a really good rival. He was the exact opposite from Naruto. He was a talented Ninja who falled behind and tried to catch up with SealsDrugsEyepower. Naruto was the one who started as a Zero and improved with hard work to catch Sasuke. It was a interesting buildup between these two Characters. In Naruto Kishimoto changed Sasuke from a rival to a villain and im not really okey with that. We already had good villains with Pain Akatsuki Madara Obito and Kaguya. Adding Sasuke to the list just made things complicated at the end and just took the tension from the other villains to compensate the tensionbuild up for Naruto vs Sasuke as the last fight.Second Question The end of SasukeSasuke was in Naruto still the Person who seeked more Power outside of hard work He took over Orochimarus Power got his MS later EMS he got the Rinnegan. Naruto was still the one who trained hard to become Stronger Sagetraining RasenShurikentraining. The NineTailsPower is  something he didnt really got with hard Work which kinda outstands sadly to the Character of Naruto. With this constellation you expect Naruto to win versus Sasuke becaus that was the moral of the Story at the beginning Hard Work and Naruto did work hard. Making the last fight into a Draw was something i really dislike. At the end Sasuke doesnt have any negative sideeffects from all the Powerups he got is free to walk around the World and got the crush from Naruto  he is able to rebuild his Clan sooner or later. Third Question Should Sasuke have died ?Thats a big Question. Killing a Character should be done if u dont have any use for him later in the Story or if the death of the Character is neccessary for the Plotdevelopment. However Kishimoto already planed the  Movies and i guess it was also planned that Sasuke will be in Boruto too. Sasuke is a popular Character and when there are still Stories ongoing after the War it would be a big loss for the CharacterSet. But in my opinion he should have died it would leave behind a intense ending with a lasting impression. It would be bad for the Character but it would be great for the Story. Last Question Was the Ending good ? No.We all wanted Naruto reaching his Goal and be the Hokage at the end. We didnt got that. Kishimoto just made a Timeskip and Naruto was with a blink of an eye the th Hokage. Its like making a Timeskip in Onepiece and u just see Monkey.D.Luffy sitting on the OnePiece and the Story ends there. Thats not what we want. We want to follow Naruto on his way becoming Hokage. We didnt see him joining the ANBU and improve his decisionmaking in dangerous Situation because sometimes a Leader need to decide harsh and strictly we didnt see him improving his Abilites and Knowledge about the World and other Villages we didnt see him mature to the point that he can be a worthy Hokage who really can change the current ShinobiWorld... at the end we dont even know how the current ShinobiWorld is working right now did he change something? was there peace ? how much influence does Naruto have?its just dissapointing,Naruto,dauy2pm,1,t5_2quts

9925038,0,t1_db0r8fy,alright yeah ill admit to all you said on minato buts it not like dan has no hype choza  sucks him off a bit with saying i dont know how easy itll be to trap you  and kakuzu calls him a gold and silver general. But on the first appearance when was he garbage it just shows him dying we dont know the cause it could have been against the most random fodder shinobior a trap or an op hanzo the salamander shinobi. im going to try to find more evidence to try to find some hype for this guy who i personally think is a worthy shinobi with the little hype we have heard but not the  feat.On your point on tobirama. ifhe had enough chakra to fight  elite shinobi. why not just use shadow clone  and transport himself and his students its suppose to be a spamable non chakra taxing jutsu as seen when minata uses it to kill . shinobi. also transport s of shinobiwith ninetails cloak out of a battlefield. i just always found it hard to believe that tobirama couldnt do that if its not a blow to his battlefield prowess like you said because he has later feats. it is defintley a shot at his intelligence and priorities no matter how you look at it. When you say that was the plan well it was a dumb plan i dont remember who created ithamura maybebut tobirama went with it.  I just dont see how any one has enough chakra to stall  elite ninja can not use the same chakra for a less taxing jutsu. and we know he had to atleast be using some powerful jutsu if he was going to stall themlong enough for his students to escape. but i digress thats for another thread.Ill try to find some more hype on Dan. and on my point on him being elite i meant like how asuma was an elite shinobi. Buton hype was we only have. kabuto choosing him for the war arc chozas orgasm over him and his own self hyping so far.ps where did he lose in a kunai fight or are you being satiricalfacetious. if you could link id appereciate it.,Naruto,db199t1,1,t5_2quts

Some old dude who was about to kick the can gave it to you...his dying wish? Spread that cure to everyone! Why? Because no one should be dealing with cancer. Its quite the noble thing to do since youre a kind and noble person. But whats this? These people dont want the cure. Cant they see that theyre going to die? No matter youre going to inject it into them for the good of humanity. Sure some people might die along the way but the end justify the means.That is how Obito and Madara saw it. These arent two villains these are two good people. From a young age Madara saw how the warring states model was broken so he actively wanted to fix it. Obito helped people every chance he got. They actively sought for peace but because were human thats nigh impossible. Absolute peace and harmony is literally impossible because of our human nature. No matter what government or system is put in place i.e. village system war is inevitable. When faced with that fact of life which is essentially is reality they saw it as cancer. These two good people want to break that curse and wanted to make it better for everyone.Ive been placing emphasis on the fact that theyre good people. In their eyes the end justified the means because they were in their eyes saving the world from reality.Edit I forgot to mention. The world think its a deluded idea...it obviously is.

10221992,0,t1_dc1xpze,Thats all fine and dandy but my greatest irk with all this is that they do not take the victims family into consideration. In reality most family of the victims will not be okay to learn that a villagecityorganization let their loved ones murderer go because the murderer is sorry. Im sure you see it all the time how murderers and rapists somehow beat the charge spurning all kinds of backlash on a national level. In Naruto the victims families are completely disregarded. Its like theres no thought that that punishment is suppose to act as solace for those who were wronged by anothers criminal action. Even within the context of this anime its very believable that someone can  become resentful towards a village who granted a pardon for a serial killer because they felt she was sorry. Its because this is fiction and the writer simply doesnt have to write any kind of backlash to that decision to free Chino that this can be called a step in ending the chains of negativity. But I know this conclusion is a complete farce. Its a fallacy. Its impossible. Nobody would be okay learning how people whove killed dozens to hundreds of innocent men women and children are being granted parole because theyre sorry.I get that this is fiction but if the theme is exploring the possibility of world peace I dont think that they should be ignoring the side of all this that would most likely take issue with the decision to pardon criminals and potentially carry on the cycle of hatred. Everything needs to be taken into context otherwise this is just a cop out.,Naruto,dc2px9k,3,t5_2quts

Sakura is like a little kid who wants to play with the big kids and then complain when the big kids dont go easy.

10310044,0,t1_dcclqyk,After watching I doubt it requires you to kill your best friend. Remember that when he said that he was lying to Sasuke about his motivations for killing the clan. Based on Itachi and Sasuke alone the way to upgrade your Sharingan is to experience great emotional upheavalturmoil. Since Itachi didnt kill his best friend to get it and neither did Sasuke rather they watched the death of someone close to them I think...did Sasuke have the MS during their battle or was that the power Itachi passed on? Its been awhile to be honestI do want to add that in the Ninja world which had an era like that of the Bloody Mist I dont think I would be so quick to say that almost nobody would kill their best friend if they thought it would increase their chances of survival. For an example of this in the Leaf village see the Foundations practices e.g. based on information we got from Sai children in the Foundation were required to kill whoever they were paired with. That person had a chance of being a friend or a close sibling and the goal was similar to the goal of when the Mist village was the Bloody Mist killinggetting rid of the emotions to become a better ninja.Edit Come to think of it wasnt it the revived Hashirama who said that it was the Uchiha who were more prone to emotional turmoil?,Naruto,dccp6tk,1,t5_2quts

10330607,0,t1_dcextj0,Lets just go full kayfabeNaruto had to make Itachi look strong by succumbing to the mana mind games before going over his clone in that handicap match. Then he had to make Deidara and Sasori both look strong by having them no sell all his offense while having Sakura Chiyo and Kakashi do all the work in that elimination tag match which went to a no contest because of interference from Team Gai.After that he was partnered with Sai from Root developmental and the two had no in ring chemistry unlike with Sasuke who was then in that weird tweener phase. Not helping that Kakashi was out on injury so they had to bring in Yamato another Root developmental talent who while a solid technical performer didnt have the sheer charisma as Kakashi. Sakura who had that solid push by going over Sasori yes it was via shenanigans but it was a no dq stipulation did next to nothing this arc and completely killed her push. It made matters worse when Danzos dumb idea to do a swerve by having Sai turn heel and betray the group went through. It almost killed the audiences trust in the guy as most people didnt care or were angry as they felt his even quicker face turn was insincere.Then after that big debacle with Orochimaru Kabuto and the  tails we finally have our rematch Naruto v Sasuke. But plans change again. Instead of having the strict one on one fight go to a no contest via interference from Orochimaru with Sasuke looking strong at the end. We instead have Sasuke going over all members of Team Kakashi.Making them all look like fools before finally Orochimaru interfered. It basically doomed all but one of them to the eternal mid card for the rest of the story.Honestly I dont want to know what would of happened if Kakuzu didnt do the honors of putting Naruto over for his retirement match when he was brought in at the last minute for the Hidan v Shikamaru feud. And Shikamaru still ended up burying Hidan!,Naruto,dcf15sz,4,t5_2quts

10375233,1,t1_dck2tkx,Yeah. Real manipulative and selfish trying to stop her best friend from going after a psychopathic madman.And I LIKE Sasuke too. But you cant deny what he had become  and what was Sakura supposed to do? The last time they had seen Sasuke hed kicked all of their asses and after that hed defeated Itachi. Sakura knew Naruto was strong but the Kyuubi was what saved Naruto against Pein and Sakura knew Naruto wouldnt be fighting to kill against Sasuke. If Sasuke and Naruto had gone up against each other in the Five Kage Summit arc Sasuke would have fucking murdered Naruto plain and simple. Sakura did the best she could in a bad situation and Im honestly kind of tired of these people coming out and acting like they would do any better.Also Naruto and Hinata talked like three times in the entire series. One time she fainted. The other time she hid behind a wooden post. The third time she slapped him.clap clap Excellent development by far. Nothing compared to dozens of chapters devoted solely to building Naruto and Sakuras relationship. Even fucking Sasuke and Sakura had more development and he tried to kill her half a dozen times.,Naruto,dck3g1s,6,t5_2quts

10431566,0,t1_dcqfcxk,I was referring to a potential current gen port. Also  we have no way to know what goes on behind closed doors at Namco. Seeing as it was Ps only it is safe to assume that it was a simple repackage of the discs already printed  to make a quick buck. Sony for example did this with their whole back catalogue on ps with their numerous trilogy and saga releases  which where just repackaged discs. It would of been great to see a Ps port I know but its not financially viable and I can see why they didnt. You hit the nail on the head with your last point. Effort. The effort needed to release them on current gen wasnt worth the financial input. ,Naruto,dcqhk0e,1,t5_2quts
10440484,0,t3_5pj1pc,Part  of Ideas Kishi introduced but never expanded upon continued  Special Guardsmen thingies that Asuma was a member off... yeah so what was up with that? They were established just to make Asuma look special and then promptly forgotten and never ever mentioned. Why not bring them back and have them try to recruit Shikamaru as a replacement? Couldve been character development. Criminal Bounty Hunting. So the Underground has members powerful enough to put hits on prominent members of Konoha... cool so who has what bounty? Who issued them? Why? Perfect opportunity to bring back Gatous Mafia inspiration by having his brother or father seeking revenge or whatever. Kabutos Intel Book on Akatsuki... we never learn just what was inside and if any of that information ever proved useful... it sure as hell didnt warn Konoha about the abilities of any other member apparently. Fuuma Clan. Oh remember that? The famous Fuuma Clan? The one from Amegakure that the one Pain guy was from? Never heard of that again. The Skeleton in Obitos base. So was that a giant dinosaur? A dead boss summon? A Dragon? Alien? It has a massive big skull... but we never learn what it was. Why not use that as foreshadowing that maybe Obito wouldve been able to summon giant Dragons? That wouldve been awesome. The Scroll Jiraya uses to seal Amateratsu. That scroll never returned one might think it couldve been weaponized and maybe used later on against someone like Nagato or whatever... opening the scroll release the flame burn one of Pains bodies. Tobiramas forbidden jutsu scroll. So Kagebunshin is on that scroll... what else? We never got to experience Naruto actually going full Kyuubi mode like full full... like with Pain but I mean full... no Minato stopping him last second... full on Kyuubi unleashed. Couldve been an entire arc to have the others try to capture the Kyuubi and rescue Naruto in the hopes he is still in there plus possible character development by having the Kyuubis and Narutos thoughts and memories flow into each other. Kurama couldve felt what Naruto went through and Naruto couldve learned about the history of the Bijuu. Danzos Konoha... Konoah was destroyed after Danzo became Hokage it wouldve been THE perfect opportunity to have Konoha be rebuild into some kind of giant military fortress dark and grim full of surveillance and oppressing. Danzo enforcing new policies that turns Konoha more militaristic and tyrannical. Let ROOT come out of the woodworks and become the primary enforcers of law. If Kishi wanted to make Danzo the scapegoat of Konohas sins then why not go all out and make him Hitler? Ninja StrategyTactics during the War. We hear and see a bit about it like on a blackboard but iirc the ONLY thing we ever actually seehear in the war is how one division managed to join up with another divison because the time table worked out as intended or something... we never see this fabled long range division do actually long range combat by raining down some artillery jutsu or whatever. Proper Doppelganger Paranoida thanks to White Zetsu. Its an idea that gets introduced and then promptly canceled when Naruto shows up who can see through the disguises even though this couldve been amazing and so much fun especially if you keep the reader in the dark as well. Zetsus Spore Infection. During the Kage Summit White Zetsu is able to infect everyone present with his spores after triggering them everyone had their Chakra sucked out and had new White Zetsu growing out of them that stolen Chakra could be given to Sasuke to rejuveneate him... so why was this ability never used against the Shinobi Alliance? There mustve been Zetsu Spores EVERYWHERE and nobody wouldve noticed because Zetsu were dying left and right as it were. Kakashi vs.  Swordsmen... yeah so we never get to see Kakashi go on a rampage and live up to his name.Overall strengths of the manga Early on Kishi actually spends quite a bit of effort into setting up this Ninja fantasy world talking about the different Villages the Kage the different countries how Missions are ranked by difficulty and so is the pay how villages cooperate for certain events how other villages represent different mentalities etc. etc. etc. Early on there are some really amazing moments of fooling the reader with mind tricks fake outs or just clever outside the box thinking. All of which take a backseat later on. One quality that Kishi really has never really looses is that he knows how to keep the ball rolling. There is never much downtime between arcs never a beat skipped it instantly moves into the next. This is something that you can really appreciate if youre familiar with other anime and manga which can have quite a bunch of filler between arc and having each arc start out on a slow burn and builds up slowly. I appreciate that Kishi spend a lot of effort into trying to explain how exactly the Ninja magic works and establishing a frame of reference for the reader to judge by what is and is not an impressive feat. The political and economical landscape of the Ninja World is pretty fascinating but Ive mentioned that many times by now. The timeskip offered overall pretty good redesigns for most characters.

10499764,0,t3_5qb108,I think that while you bring up a lot of good points Tobirama was still actually a rather good Hokage just a flawed one Which I think makes him a better character than a certain one... cough cough Minato cough.But to be fair if you had to manage a village comprised of several different clans one of which was substantially stronger than all the others after having had your siblings killed by them and having warred with them for your whole life youd be pretty damn cautious when dealing with them. Youd probably be especially careful if almost all of them have the potential to access abilities that include predicting an opponents movements perfect memory can use very strong genjutsu that can also control the kyuubi to altering reality Izanagi and beating Kabuto Izanami. These are all really powerful techniques that an Uchiha with even just one tomoe can access.Futhermore the abilities listed above are all non mangekyo skills which means we are completely ignoring the two absolute monsters that are Izuna and Madara. Now not all Uchiha have the ability to awaken the Mangekyo but some do and thats probably going to be a pain considering the last leader of the Uchiha desired total control over Konoha and all the other newborn ninja villages.TLDRUchihas can warp reality are basically seeing  seconds into the future and can control the ninetails. Also a bunch of them can be rather emotionally unstable which happens when awakening the next level of your powers is triggered by emotional trauma.,Naruto,dcy9c4v,3,t5_2quts

10552505,0,t1_dd3yxjv,gtYou can when theyre accepted into the alliance without question.you are drawing conclusion without evidence but to some degree its true no one objected to Hashirama being leader besides Madara from what we know but biased against still is a thing because of what rumors were spreading about the Uchiha which suggest bias at least for some you dont spread rumors about someone without having something against them.gtThey did the only population of the village then was the Senju and Uchiha. Tobirama told Hashirama to let the people decide. You saying the Uchiha didnt vote is completely groundless and directly contradicts what was said.I didnt say they didnt vote I said there is no proof they voted there is a difference and no by the time they talked about voting there was also the sarutobi and shimura and most likely more clans already joined.gtTobirama did not know this and there is nothing to ever indicate he did.maybe he didnt in the past he has done the best he could as Hokage but that doesnt change he made mistakes and after being revived he did admit he might helped in set things in motion that caused the Uchiha massacre.gtHiruzen was stated to be the strongest which is also a requirement to be Hokage.now you just adding a new criterion for the job no you dont need to be the strongest its enough being strong as a Hokage by this criterion then Tsunade shouldnt had become a Hokage as Jiraya is stronger also Kakashi should never even be close as without his sharingan he is half the ninja he used to be and is not close even to being the strongest. so my point still stands Kagami could of made a good choice which but at the time he wasnt even mentioned or considered by Tobirama.gtThis is all just groundless assumptions by you Tobirama never stated he hated them and has worked with plenty of Uchiha in the village.he doesnt need to say he hates them the fact they did kill many of his family and friends is enough to know he can never think of them as his friends deep down its not something you just forgive by any normal standards even Naruto couldnt forgive Nagato for killing Jiraya but he put the hate aside to end the cycle to make a change in a way thats what Tobirama  did as well but from being mortal enemies to nakama its asking the impossible if you dont realize that then there is no point in arguing anymore about this subject.gtYes Obito did lie about that though as there is direct proof proving that isnt the case. Same as with the massacre as we see that it was only between Itachi and Danzou from Itachis own memories no one else. And Minato wasnt even alive then.if there is proof then show dont tell is that is no proof at all anime fillers do not count.Minato not being alive is the point if he was he could of changed something suggesting he himself believed if he was there he could of done something which is to say there was enough time to make a difference.gtNo its useless because Gaara isnt a HOKAGE. The entire main point of Itachis speech.he is a KAGE  Ho Kaze Rai Mizu Tsuchi they are all the same role of the the protectors of the hidden villages the gokage all based on the same idea there is no real difference between a hokage or mizukage or any other kage the all full on the same group named the gokage the  shadows of the great shinobi villages Itachi was referring to Hokage because he is a Konoha shinobi and so is Naruto but the ideal he thinks applies to all kages thinking otherwise is just not true plain and simple. gtI was talking about Orochimaru after the series not when he was a leaf Ninja. Both Sasuke and Orochimaru have the same chance to become Hokage . Because they arent Leaf Ninja anymore.with that logic then Naruto cant be Hokage either he is still a genin to become a hokage you first need to be a Jonin Sasuke has returned to Konoha his status as a nukenin should change and if he isnt a leaf ninja why is he getting missions from Kakashi Sasuke Shinden or when he goes on a mission to find who Kaguya was making an army for  Naruto and the other Kages. or when he protects Konoha from an asteroid when Naruto is not around. I think Sasuke has proven his loyalties to Konoha post ending and should get the chance to become Hokage if he that is what he wants. frankly it would be the best thing he could ever do to honor Itachis memory and prove without any doubt that Madara was wrong Hashirama ideal can become true if you work with others to achieve it.,Naruto,dd48u3x,1,t5_2quts

Naruto gains some pretty amazing jutsu but he would absolutely need his demon form to be on par with Lees Inner Gates. The cloak would most likely put him over Lee in a fight but base tailed beast Naruto vs. Lee going all out is the closest fight that could happen among the Genin prior to Sasuke leaving the village.Speaking of Sasuke has no chance against a Lee going all out with the Inner Gates until the valley of the end. His Sharingan couldnt keep up and he lacks any reliable way to tag Lee with the Chidori. He suffers the same problem Naruto encounters where even though he has powerful jutsu he doesnt have enough in his arsenal to take care of someone using the power Lee can unleash.

Itachi does mention that normal visual genjutsu is useless against djutsu but IMO the Sharingan seems to be better at it. So far AFAIK only the Sharingan and Sasukes Rinnegan has demonstrated an actual immunity to a visual genjutsu through the ability to see through it andor breakreverse it.

11002586,0,t3_5x2lfn,Because so much of this series was spoilt for me not knowing how the wedding goes what everyone gets or how Naruto and Hinata react is a small blessing.  Dont worry Gaara. You shouldnt be a bachelor for long. One of your many fangirls is just itching for you to say the magic words.  No need to say what would happen if Lee and Guy were in charge of presents. The series question is the financial implications of fitness shops doing such booming business in a short amount of time.  Come on now Iruka. Shouldnt you be surprised if Naruto isnt friends with someone by this point? Mind its mildly interesting how Iruka didnt know Gaara was Narutos friend.  What was the music here? As uirishsaltytuna said VR??  Love how Kankuros extravagant gift ideas are the worst things for a desert city to produce. Flowers giant tuna and lollies well Im assuming they take lots of water somewhere in the production to make if were continuing with the theme The Hidden Cloud Dance!   The Hidden Cloud Dance!?   I love how terrified Gaara is. More than anything in the series since he grew up the prospect of having to dance is what scares him the most. Perfectly understandable I hereby call for an annual Kage Danceoff a friendly competition to represent the alliances forged in the Fourth Shinobi War And it begins Ladies towels will be provided free of charge ORO WATCH  suspect seems distracted by an equally suspicious visitor.  Oro and Yamato are like Wheres Wally Temari walking along downcast. The setting sun representing her slipping chance to make things right with Shikamaru. When nightfall comes the damage from yesterday will be irreparable. She keeps walking without realising it every step making her indecision worse. Then she hears a yo What an inspirational bro Shikamaru is taking charge and smoothing things over ORO WATCH. Or would be if Yamato was at his job. Seems like the best way to stop him is to make his voucher expire. Either that or hes a happy drunk By this point Im convinced Konoha has a underhand Ramen monopoly crisis. I mean have we seen any other place that isnt Ichiraku Ramen selling it? So uh was Kankuro asking the spirits of the previous Hokage for forgiveness? Bois! Its happening!!! Friends huh. Come on Gaara theres no need to say it like that when youre the respected and loved leader of your village and one of the key unites of all Shinobi Make sure you lock up? Ayame lock up what? Lock the flaps so noone can get in? Oh Ramen Guy. As thoughtful as your gift is you have now doomed your daughter to a life in the streets.  Temaris little swing to her walk was cute. You know she and Shikamaru are the types who wont long be sidestepping their liking for each other.

11138230,0,t1_deu82gu,Yeah no. Sasukes plan is doomed to fail for a number of reasons.First he doesnt know  anything about how Kaguya actually became immortal.Because Kaguya and the Otsutsukis dont become immortal from the rinnegan they get it from eating the fruit from a God Tree or converting the fruit into pills to extend their life in the case of Momoshiki and Kinshiki.Sasuke cant do that because Kaguya and by proxy that planets God Tree is sealed in an inaccessible dimension. Plus the tailed beasts he plans to kill are needed to reform the God Tree.So when age finally catches up to Sasuke like it did Madara hell be as weak and vulnerable just like any other old man. Except unlike Madara he wont have the gedo statue to act as his life support. Leaving him dead and the world to continue on without him in a worse state than before because the Shinobi Union didnt happen like it did in canon.That is if they all survive the Otsutsukis.Because the other Otsutsukis plans will continue regardless if Naruto lives or dies.Toneri Hes still going to destroy the Earth with the Moon and Sasuke will have an even more difficult time than Naruto did because  Konoha had to gather intel to find the portal connecting the Earth and Moon The Cloud village wont be able to make their chakra cannon like they were originally able too in the two years of peace as explained in the movie. Sasuke cant destroy the Tenseigan energy vessel without assistance from the inheritor of Hamuras chakra Hinata who with the rest of the remaining K will be the first to die after they learn that Sasuke killed Naruto. Sasuke has no resistance against Toneris chakra drain which was able to deplete Narutos reserves in seconds. Toneri with the Tenseigan can split the moon and only Naruto is durable enough to withstand such an attack. Momoshiki and Kinshiki Theyll still come to Earth to steal Kaguyas chakra and plant the God Tree. Theyll also be infuriated to find that Sasuke killed the Tailed Beasts and will kill him along with the rest of the planets population because Sasuke had to escape from his battle with Kinshiki while Momoshiki never interfered and wasnt the least bit phased  by his rinnegan They were able to incapacitate and capture Naruto with minimal effort. A powered up Momoshiki was able to mortally wound Sasuke who needed Naruto to heal him while he was incapacitated.This was from a Sasuke who was experienced with his rinnegan and prepared for their arrival.Revolution Sasuke would fare even worse now that he would be solely focused on being the worlds enemy instead of researching about the other Otsutsukis. Then having to fight enemies just as if not stronger than him alone.This isnt even mentioning the major flaw in his rinnegan. That being its  recharge  period that shuts off  his EMS if he uses too much chakra like his dimension hopping. And Sasuke will have to be using a lot of chakra in both battles with Toneri and the duo of Momoshiki and Kinshiki.,Naruto,deui9mr,2,t5_2quts

11213396,0,t1_df300w1,I wouldnt say her development becomes stagnant or even stops after the Chunin Exams. She used to be this really shy and depressed girl with no selfesteem at the start of the series. Now shes far more confident and has become much stronger in character the kind of person Naruto wants to spend the rest of his life with also noteworthy that once she starts dating Naruto she no longer stutters when she talks. Hinata shows gradual development as the series goes on and its all because she refused to give up fighting her personal demons. It may not always get a lot of focus and screentime but that doesnt mean the change isnt there.Also we did learn something from her encounter with Pain we learned how far shes willing to go in order to protect the person she loves to the point where she isnt even afraid of dying. This is a really impactful event not only because Hinata finally came to grips with her feelings towards Naruto but most of the fanbase see this as the moment NaruHina became cemented as the pairing that makes the most sense.,Naruto,df30x9u,1,t5_2quts

11227420,0,t1_df4lm8z,I already told you I agree that Kakashi is weakest of the Kages. But in his Primelets leave Narka Path.. kakashi fought Bravely against Two paths of Pain. Tendo Pains pull push ability stoped kakashi Pain himself praised Kakashi saying that any other person in his place would be dead by now... The thing is we cannot take away kakashis sharingan because he got sharing at the time he knew nothing about fighting..all his fighting skill developed around sharingan once he got it. It would be a different story he would have developed different skill set if he had no sharingan and why wont he use the sharingan if he has one..? Flying Diedra was a difficult target it would have been more easy for him to cast kamui if he was on ground. I think Kakashi could have killed Diedra if he had not used his kamui to stop the Diedras clone explosion.  I am not saying that just because Dad is strong the child would be strong. But Kakashi was considered genius enough to be said a worthy son to White Fang only two people outsmarted kakashi in terms of talent and genius one the Konahas yellow Flash and other the Prodigy Of Sharingan . Kakashi Taijutsu was good enough that Might guy considered him his rival so he can easily defeat Asuma with or without sharingan.And about the other two st and rd kage both were know as gods of shinobi although asuma was lame Tsuade at some extent was near to Hasirama in terms of Name...FFS Hashirama is god.,Naruto,df4m3bp,1,t5_2quts

11376400,0,t1_dflg528,. Im not completely dismissing it Im just saying that I dont think it was the authors intention to portray their relationship as bad with that more likely because he didnt feel the need to write it in. And its stated that after Sarada was born Sasuke stayed with her and Sakura and they lived as a normal family until he was called to an important mission sometime in Saradas early childhood. This is  true. . This was just after the war when they werent even married Sasuke felt guilty and wanted time to himself to reflect on his past deeds and atone. So its fair enough that he wanted to be alone and nothing wrong with him not taking Sakura with him. And even so after Sasuke returns to the village he lives with Sakura for a while and even lets her accompany him when he resumes his journey. This is when she gets pregnant with his child.. I think your view is way too biased with this one. Here hes saying that Sarada is here because of his connection with Sakura as in youre proof that I love Sakura not that he only stays with Sakura because of Sarada. Thats a really harsh way of looking at it and I can guarantee you that Masashi did NOT intend it to be seen that way. . If thats not the case then he was simply teasing her. I think its way too harsh to assume that he doesnt love her because of it. He even smirks at her whilst walking away. gtBefore departing he notices that Sarada is sad and comforts her by hugging her and poking her on the forehead assuring her he will come home soon. When Sakura attempts to receive affection from him Sasuke teases her by walking away and bidding them farewell much to her disappointment.From . He left in her early childhood when she was like . Shes obviously grown since then. He had just been attacked by Shin Uchiha and was on high alert. Seeing a girl the same age with the same attire and with a Sharingan likely drew his suspicions. It is completely excusable.  And I dont think he expected to meet his daughter out here alone like that.Edit  For some reason my  come out as .,Naruto,dflhud2,0,t5_2quts

Imagine naruto not being an all powerful God character who couldnt cloak everyone in plotarmor chakra and actually having the face the realization that the world he lives in is the way it is for a reason. Going back to this fight this was back when this show had a lot of potential. These were genin who were unaware of the struggles they actually have to face. Theyve never sacrificed theyve always had their team leaders to pull them out of a hard place and they were still trying to identify the shinobi they would be.

11552890,0,t1_dg4mwr6,All of those make up compelling evidence. All Im saying is that there is no explicit evidence. The problem with putting forth circumstantial evidence is who gets to draw the line when its enough to make an actual assertive claim? If kishi had just given one line with Izanami and Madara in it that would have been enough. But for the sake of discussion sure lets go ahead with the notion that Madara probably does know Izanami.I mean that depends on which Itachi right? Itachi had Koto for many years until he passed it onto Naruto. BoS Itachi definitely had Koto and he was probably stronger at that point than at the point where he died to his aids and fighting SasukeOrochimaru. We havent seen any evidence showing that extensive timeeffort is required to program Koto aside from its long cooldown. For what we do know Madara programmed Izanagi amid his battle with Hashi Itachi programmed Amaterasu with supposedly a finger tap. I dont think setting up Koto would take any more time than simply bringing out his crow like how he did when he gave it to Naruto. Also Koto has been shown to not require eye contact.You dont really have to give me the benefit of the doubt. His quote was but a jutsu that has an escape route is too dangerous to use in actual combat even though he literally just used it in actual combat and not even for the purposes it was originally designed for. It may be dangerous but not necessarily ineffective or unusable. Unless Madara is bloodlusted I think Itachi has a fair chance given that Madara didnt even go all out against the  kages until he was pushed to. Would he feel more threatened by a single Uchiha? Even though I think should be since its Itachi I dont think Madara would be. The time he spends going easy on Itachi could be enough time to activate Izanami.gtKeep in mind that he died once while trying to set it up against a weaker opponent.Ok this is something I want to talk about. From what I understand by this Itachi had casted Izanami from the first time Kabuto struck him and even then it was a crow substution. So all of the times Kabuto tagged Itachi was in the Izanami right? But then later on hes like I shall now engage the Izanami right before getting cut in half.,Naruto,dg5iv1n,1,t5_2quts

With that being said how can you possibly say how can anyone possibly say that the animation wasnt so bad? It was spectacular this episode. EVERYTHING was super fluid yet when Boruto ep.  came out everyone somehow lauded it as the second coming of Jesus in the form of animation. Boruto ep.  had dog shit animation..!

11793508,0,t3_689zus,Ive never understood the talent v hard work aspect to naruto. It feels like in the beginning of naruto the hard worker naruto was just slacking off all the time whilst the talented sasuke was constantly training.I think it then goes on throughout the series with sasuke continuing to focus on nothing but training and getting better whilst naruto is still not training as hard. i mean in the fight against kaguya doesnt naruto say something like he has put the most time into his sexy jutsu? maybe im misremebering or it was a joke but i think that just goes to show how much hard work he was really putting in. I think the hard work aspect is also seen with indra and ashura. but once again here indra the talented one was the one who was constantly working and improving devoting all his time to training whilst ashura hard worker was messing around. i dont really know what to make of the talent v hard work idea. i suppose at the end of the day no one who reached top tier didnt work. but at the same time none of them were normal people. they either had natural talent be it through keke genki or some other unnatural advantage. i guess the overall message of naruto is to just give up as even if you work hard like sakura you will never be as strong as the naturally talented naruto and sasuke. and how guy to even be close to being a threat towards madra had to kill himself in the process,Naruto,dgwu15w,11,t5_2quts
11793709,0,t1_dgwuotg,Well now youre just being a prick. That statement itself hasnt been retconned. Therefore we still take it as true. Thats how it works. Hidan being alive in the war does not contradict the previous statement because we dont know how his body is affected by malnutrition and how slowly he is dying. Maybe he can extend that duration using his Chakra. Who knows. But until Kodachi comes out and says Hidan is still alive and will never die we assume he is dyingdead of malnutrition.,Naruto,dgwuuok,1,t5_2quts
11793891,0,t1_dgwuhvg,Its not that nobody likes your idea nobody likes your presentation of it sorry if that sounds rude. You gave a whatif that doesnt make much sense is really obscure and highly unlikely. If you had made this thread as a cool Justu idea thread then Im sure it would be much more positively received. But you made a theory thread that comes off as illogical. Because your theory first require boruto to know hidden mist jutsu which he doesnt and will never know then require kakashi to train him which very well could happen. Then it requires boruto to change his core fighting style following his training with Sasuke. Then it requires boruto to come up with a very specific idea to incorporate lighting style into a water style jutsu. Theres just too many hoops to jump so its kind of pointless to theorize about it.,Naruto,dgwvlgc,0,t5_2quts
