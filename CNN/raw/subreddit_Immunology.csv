548927,0,t1_cg2nzmz,sadly im no minority and my last time in a lab was an undergrad biologymicro course I took about  years ago. Ill have a look around for some entry level lab work offerings. I currently work in clinical research for a UC so may be able to find a professor somewhere to help me out. ,Immunology,cg2o3s7,1,t5_2qlnp

My recommendation buy a new kit but still use your old reagents in a parallel experiment.  No harm in doing so and it could save you a lot of money because now youll have  kits that will last past their expiration pending results,Immunology,cn1nt1c,1,t5_2qlnp

4940120,0,t3_3ikkm2,I love it when questions on my topic come up!There are a few reasons.One simple circular but true reason is that its whats people do when people want to assess the repertoire or get told by reviewers they need to they look what has been done most before and do that. Vb is sequenced more therefore Vb gets sequenced more.From a scientific stand point there are two main reasons. One is that the TRB locus recombines first in developing thymocytes only once a cell has passed beta selection will the alpha chain rearrange. Beta chains also tend to be more diverse due to having a D gene and all the extra nontemplated diversity it brings as well as not having invariant chains appearing in certain cell types which can be argued makes them more interesting. There are also a few other minor reasons that might also contribute like historical order of discovery beta first then even gamma was found before alpha availability of monoclonal antibodies to confirm again usually more for beta.Basically it comes down to the bottom line sequencing two would cost twice as much so most people only do one. That said in my lab we sequence both and I find loads of interesting stuff in alpha and struggle to find data from others to corroborate so I wish more people did!,Immunology,cuh8pfl,4,t5_2qlnp
