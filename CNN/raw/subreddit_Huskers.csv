I know that promotion rubs a lot of people the wrong way but work with me on this one.Months ago a coworker and I came up with the idea for a Huskercentric podcast. We are both parttimers on the sports desk at the Journal Star and we thought this would be a step to help modernize our paper and give an enjoyable product to people who want to listen. Its centered on Husker athletics but in a week of no big Nebraska news we talk about big issues in college athletics as well as professional athletics.Weve had Steven M. Sipple on in the past we hope to get him and other Journal Star writers on in the future to talk about the sports they cover. We have plans of doing small debate episodes where we talk about issues in college athletics i.e. paying athletes college realignment. We crack jokes and use pop culture references repeatedly as we try not to bore you with hard numbers but break down how it affects Nebraska as a program in more detail than any column would touch on.There are new episodes up every week that you can stream at the Journal Star website. You can also stream it at Podbean.com or subscribe and download for free! on iTunes. Also follow us on Twitter OTLPod.

5631415,0,t1_cwssq0f,The rule doesnt require only helmet to helmet for a targeting penalty. If you hit a player anywhere with the crown of your helmet its supposed to be a targeting penalty and ejection. The consistency on these calls is HORRIBLE Ive seen flags thrown on clean hits and just as many no calls on dirty hits. The first hit on Westerkamp should have been a targeting penalty and ejection according to the rule book. I have mixed feelings on the rule itself as I feel if you hit someone with your shoulder pads even if its right directly to the head it shouldnt be a penalty. Football is a violent sport. Part of the problem is players these days wear shoulder pads that are about as big as the Hutch Halloween  costume pads we wore when we were kids which exposes your head and neck much more than in the past.,Huskers,cwv4p5w,1,t5_2r7qs

5701001,0,t1_cx3l4mw,A couple of thoughts.  First as you mentioned a bowl appearance hasnt meant anything since back in the day.  The number of bowls is already ridiculous and even if you restrict it to  teams only there are going to be tons of shitty teams going to bowls.  Would anyone say that factoring in strength of schedule there wont be many  teams better than many  teams?  If  teams that were worse than a hypothetical  Nebraska team got to go why would it be any big crime for that Nebraska team to go?  To me its complaining about watering down what is already at this point just water.Second its not really a participation trophy because all the bowls arent equal and nobody thinks they are.  Not all teams get the same thing.  The best teams will be in the CFB playoff bowls and other good teams will be at bowls with longer histories that people have actually heard of like the Rose Bowl or the Fiesta Bowl.  Shitty teams will be playing in the likes of the Raycom Media Camellia Bowl or the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl.  The players on these teams all know what that means you suck but not so much that nobody will watch you or gamble on you.Finally Im not sure the purpose of the bowls is to reward the players.  Definitely not at this point.  It is to let fans watch and gamble on more college football.  It lets us see some games which otherwise wouldnt have happened and can be quite fun.  I wouldnt care if every FBS team got to go to a bowl.  In fact I think it might even be a good idea.The playoffs conference championships and rankings can be used to reward the players for being good on the field.  And we the fans can have a shit ton of bowls to get us through the holiday season.  I dont see a problem.,Huskers,cx3rj3x,9,t5_2r7qs

Hes a running QB and thats what they need to do with him.Im not saying our D will be stellar but a D that can play like they did tonight with some spurts of okayness will be sufficient to win us games if we have an offense thats ran properly. Unfortunately Im afraid were going to see the same thing from the coaching staff. Too many passes when Tommy just isnt a passing QB. Maybe since they have POB they wont have to worry about Tommy getting hurt or trying to implement their offense to show recruits what they want to do someday.

Id love to hear whos doing more with less there.on the line the line played well but to argue that there isnt a significant gap in talent between walkons and scholarship players is just not true. gt He knew what he had at QB and chose to focus on developing the passing game more than the running game.We ran the ball on  of our plays.And as far as the corner play part of it was going against Samuel who singlehandedly beat us that game but it was the corners who got torched time and time again.,Huskers,dazlj2l,2,t5_2r7qs

Progress is easy to do when youre awful and then move to terrible I guess we can go with that.Directionally they need to move away from a half court offensive style of play and move to a fast and shot taking mentality.  One that doesnt get you benched for taking a quick open look or missing a defensive assignment.  One that is not standing at the top of the key and ball screening to move inside out trying to get the switch to the correct match up.  One that doesnt involve Miles going nuts over calls and then forcing the refs to call the game against his team harder.  One without Tim Miles.
