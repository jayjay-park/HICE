4295996,0,t1_cs9o2wm,Yup not interested in a goddamn mobile game or a mobile port. What a shit show well played on the cloak and dagger hype train on their part though.I have only myself to blame I should have known this was going to be a bust from the fact that there was almost no goddamn information about the game just rampant speculation. I was so hyped about a legit PC football game that I just kind of turned a blind eye to the fact this shit was just too good to be true. Oh well live and learn I guess.,joemontanafootball16,cs9vqlp,5,t5_37aac
