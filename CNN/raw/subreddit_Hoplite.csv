10404806,0,t3_5a3uml,If you havent already done it for posteritys sakedont go to ny altars unless it is pretty much on your way and wont mean that you have to spend a few extra turns avoiding getting hit avoid killing enemies as much as you can race to the exit. If you leap twice towards the exit that saves you two turns.  Make sure you get winged sandals as that would mean you can cross a level in very few turns hypoteticallyGood luck!,Hoplite,dcnga2z,1,t5_2s3ak
