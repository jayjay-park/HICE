3451714,0,t3_2mg9sd,I always liked both Bomberman and Max.  They provided the hero and antihero dynamic in a simple but memorable way.Other interesting characters Sirius Manipulating powerful and cool design.  Great villain. Regulus Archrival who is very strong and extremely stubborn.  Wish hed appear again. Evil Bomber Simple but cool design.  Only appeared in a few games.,bomberman,cplq0e8,1,t5_2tk3f
