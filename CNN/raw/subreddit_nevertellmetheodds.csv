4309299,0,t3_3ab2y6,Director Jeunet wanted to display Ripleys new powers including a scene in which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computergenerated imagery CGI. Weaver however was determined to make the shot authentic and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes during which none of the balls went in. The crew were going to give up but gave Weaver one last shot and in this take she got the ball in perfectly the idea that she did it in one take is a myth. The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was onscreen for the entire scene but Weaver refused. Ron Perlman broke character when she made the basket and turned to the camera to say Oh my god! There was enough of a pause between Weavers basket and Perlmans statement for the films editors to cut the scene accordingly during postproduction.  In the Zone  The Basketball Scene.

9065803,0,t1_d81ezp5,I actually had this moment with my grandfather back in the early s. I was in junior high school and pencil fighting was a big thing even outside school grounds.  For those that dont know pencil fighting went down like this. Two people each have a pencil. After a rockpaperscissors match to decide who goes first the loser holds his pencil horizontal grabbing each end tight and leaving the middle exposed. The winner tries to break the pencil with his pencil usually by holding the base in one hand the top with the thumb and forefinger of the other and flicking the pencil to hit the opponents pencil. If the opponents pencil didnt break then it was his turn to try to break the other pencil. The loser of the game was the one left with a broken pencil.  We didnt have the hand held devices that we do today but we did have Gameboys Super Nintendos and various other gadgets and toys that could have taken our attention but pencil fighting took over. The student store was always out of pencils. Kids were trying to introduce different kinds of pencils strategies and the like. The lunch area was littered with broken pencils. After school I would go to my friends house and pencil fight him and I had my arsenal of my winning pencils.  So we visit my grandpa one day and he has gifts for us. For me it was some school supplies. I got really excited which was NOT the reaction my mom was expecting because the pencils he got had some sort of plastic coating that Ive seen on other pencils at school. Pencils that won. I explained the whole thing to my grandpa and he started talking about playing marbles when he was a kid. Turns out that playing marbles was actually a big thing at my school in the previous year. It was a weird bonding moment we had over rudimentary forms of childhood entertainment.,nevertellmetheodds,d81k9zu,397,t5_38iwx

11581962,0,t3_654b6n,The William West on the left clearly has a wider face in general wider mouth wider chin wider nose wider more spaced out eyebrows and his eyes are more spaced out. I definitely can understand why they might look the same but it only took  seconds to find major facial differences. I would bet money that they were mistaken for each other largely for being black while having the same name and somewhat similar faces didnt help at all even though the differences are easily noticeable with some thought. Even if the prison story isnt true the faces were definitely mixed up by someone just for different reasons. ,nevertellmetheodds,dg8tlz2,1,t5_38iwx

11776017,0,t1_dguna4r,gt my phone tells me to unplug it when its fully charged to save power.It is lying.If you pull mAh at .V from a battery you need to charge it with mAh at .V. Since energy  Amps x Volts x time youre putting more energy into the battery than you get out this is always true of every system because thermodynamics.However what will happen if you leave the battery at  all the time is that it will degrade faster. Lithium cells are most stable at  state of charge. ,nevertellmetheodds,dguuj1w,2,t5_38iwx
11776153,0,t1_dgurpjb,Gonna add to the echo chamber. I also was long time RIF user and switched to Relay. The biggest thing for me was the gifs. I always had issues with RIF were gifs from any source other than imgur would often take a full minute to connect and then I still had to wait for them to buffer. Relay connects instantly and the built in gif viewer makes watching them far more streamlined.
