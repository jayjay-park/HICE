11504156,0,t3_642nkb,Havent experienced it personally. I know a lot of people have been asking about VR support and first person grappling first person was added in this alpha and can be accessed with V but grappling pulls you back to third person and Bossas response is that neither are on the cards right now because of potential motion sickness issues.Id imagine options such as FOV will be added once the ingame options are more fleshed out hopefully that will remedy the situation for you.,WorldsAdrift,dfzzvsz,2,t5_35hbn
