9110184,0,t1_d86uttn,Can you disconnect it from the keyboard AND the motherboard?That sounds strange to me  but anyways. If you can replace that Id bet it would fix your issues. Those are so fragile that if it came loose and got pinched when they taped it down you could have a wire or two shorting out. If you need to laptop keyboard replacements are usually pretty cheap. ,computer_help,d86waoy,3,t5_2zha6

10276565,0,t3_5mvzp7,Well there are ways to hide files inside things like documents or videos as you have experienced here but the method that also can be used is to hide a line of code that when run on a vulnerable system automatically executes. The code approach often isnt used in mass infection on systems unless there have been a new code execution exploit shown in the wild recently. The code downloades the malware from a server so technically there isnt malware in the file only a code that can download something. It can also be hidden inside files as encrypted and a lot of other ways. I can provide you with a few links about it from a hackers perspective if you want. Here I would guess it was encoded inside the file and you actually unencrypted it and ran it when you ran the file. If you still have the files I would like to look a bit further on them in my VM. Just pm them to me using some kind of place you can upload them. Remember probably about half of the torrents found by a normal internet search are either infected or watched by the government. I can not tell about safe places to torrent as torrenting copyrighted material is illegal.Kristian,computer_help,dc8wk6m,1,t5_2zha6
10300709,0,t1_dcak5si,Youre welcome! I know the awesome feel of a mod in such game  the feeling is great!!! Btw out of curiosity since youve added some additional drives are you planning to setup some kind of RAID or you want to use them as separate locations? Maybe even leave one of the HDDs as a backup location?Speaking of backup its pretty important to have such IMO because that way the data is secured on multiple locations. There are some backup strategies too and I personally prefer the so called  backup strategy which stands for  copies  different storage mediums and  offsite. In short this system stand for having a copy on your computer if you need it on your PC of course a copy on something else in your house like an external HDD or NAS for instance and on an offsite application. Of course you can deelop one on your own if you want and as long as you are not storing all your eggs in one basket it will work.,computer_help,dcbn38s,2,t5_2zha6

11019258,0,t1_degehu9,It started as a Windows  machine. Im in the process of downloading the missing software from Asus. After that all should be well. I think I may keep recovery partitions and instead download a third party partition manager. I should state that the entire reason I decided to venture down this path was so that I could adjust the size of my C and D partitions. Being that there is a recovery partition between them I could not simply do so with Disk Management. Any recommendations on a particular partition manager?,computer_help,deh03av,1,t5_2zha6
