I consider myself rather technically inclined hell Im a software developer with a CS degree and for all my research on the subject I cant figure out how the hell it works.

And theres zero difference except maybe in the obscure minute technical details between any of the cryptocurrencies. So which ones are legitimate and which ones arent?

1119112,0,t1_chvhc8x,gtExcept that isnt true at all they would consolidate wealth in the exact same way that they consolidate wealth now. Under a free market monopolies form naturally a lot of libertarians dont seem to recognize that or they actively reject it.Free market monopolies can indeed form but wealth is NOT consolidated in the same way. In a free market a large company can only consolidate its wealth by continually competing against innovators and providing the best perceived value on the market. Sure a monopolist can buy his competitors out and adopt their innovations but that still forces the monopolist to compete and provide better products and services.When a state is in play there is no need to compete innovate or provide better products or services. Look at Comcast. Look at Bell Canada. Look at Monsanto. Visa and Mastercard. These are not companies that secure their wealth by competing and innovating. They secure their wealth through relatively cheap lobbying efforts that artificially increase the barrier to entry. I dont think theres a libertarianancap in the world that would argue monopolies never happen in the free market. We simply understand that natural monopolies are nowhere near as destructive as monopolies built through regulatory capture and state manipulation where consumers are literally given zero choice.gtDo you know how companies secure their wealth and real estate when the state doesnt exist or is unreliable? They do it with private security and that private security doesnt have to abide by any law. Who wins in that power relation? The company does it has more power it can do as much as it can get away with.Why in gods name would anyone buy a serviceproduct from a company that threatens them with force? If were still talking about business monopolies any businessman worth his salt would know that violence against your consumer base is just about the worst thing you can do if you want to keep selling your productsservices.If youre talking about a monopolist who uses his power to buy so much security that he then can FORCE people to pay tribute well then youre no longer describing just any old monopoly. Youre describing the monopoly of violence the birth of another government. Sure a state run by a sociopathic monopolist would probably not be that safe for people residing in its zone of control. But it would be a lot more safe for everyone else than empirestates like the U.S. Russia and China. Furthermore a hostile takeover by a wealthy aristocrat is most likely not going to last very long unless the people are propagandized enough to believe that its in their collective best interest to remain aligned to the monopolist.gtIt goes beyond that the business person does it to stay competitive they have to balance profit with competition its beyond individual greed even if individual greed plays a big role.Oh absolutely. As a businessman myself I couldnt agree more. Its a mere function of business. If there is a good ROI and no real risk there is no real reason for a corporation not to take advantage of an opportunity. gt Also sorry if this comment sounds rude I dont feel like rewording it to make it more civilised right now.No worries man  Had my fair share of arguments on reddit.

3405858,0,t1_cpfaywa,When there are computing machines as small as a cell phone and as big as a stationary being used for the exact same thing you know things can be done differently.Dont you think its a waste of a systems power and capabilities for it to be only used by one person at any givin time? And there is nothing else out there in the market which can do anything differently. Can you imagine a machine highly customizable for two or more people to use it side by side or in a vicinity like homes for schools for everything that needs cooperation.

6476594,0,t1_czp6h3w,gt For people I tend to think of a framework similar to the Needs of Maslows Hierarchy.    Id seen that before but had forgotten about it. Thanks for the reminder. For me the bottom of the pyramid is IMO the only considerations that should follow from the idea of selfownership plus one from the next level property.    All other needs are as you say are subjective. Their value only debatable in the context of the first level of needs and property from the second.     To me this makes the upper value dispute resolution a much easier problem as the base values are fairly common across all cultures. They seem to be hard coded into higher animals so leaving the subjective values aside most people will IMO reach similar conclusion in the case of disputes about these simple values.     Additionally if dispute resolution of these simpler values still doesnt result in a fair or equitable outcome it would seem a much easier to resolve in an additional debate. Ex. I wont be able to breathe due to your actions is a pretty black and white scenario.     gtMaybe were just creating tools for identifying thieves to enable others to ostracize them or avoid transacting with them in the future?   Yes thats where I think society should be headed. Im against punishment of the type we see today. Following the idea of selfownership ostracism is a builtin action or to be precise a lack of action a negative right freedom of association.     gtThat alone may make the notion of arresting thieves seem kind of quaint.   Yes but Id put it more strongly based on rights. When does a rd party have a right to intervene in a dispute? Has that rd party paid a cost? Will arresting this individual resolve a dispute theyre party to?      gtThat strikes me as a vast improvement over the current system already even though it does nothing to restore property to the victim or resolve that discrete dispute.    Youve hit on the major problem with current legal systems. The systems are about the continuation of the system and the nebulous idea of public safety.
