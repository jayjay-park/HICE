I also struggle with social anxiety so the wave of fear that overcame me when I first got to state seminar last year and heard HEY HOBY THIS IS uuhltide... HEY uhltide!!! yelled through a hall of  kids was insane. I wanted to run right out the door get back into my moms car and never look back but in the three days I was there I had no regrets. People dont care in that they wont be judging you. They do not care who you are where you came from what you look like or any problems you have. They only care in bringing out the best in each person and making sure that you live to your full potential. Just go and be you no matter what everyone will meet you with open arms. I have a very close Texas HOBYian friend from WLC I will check to see if she will be there and if she will meet up with you!,HOBY,ci5apa5,1,t5_319o6
