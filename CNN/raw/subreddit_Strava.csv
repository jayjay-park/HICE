546087,0,t3_20dvmf,Ive found that overpasses are often not as much climbing as you think. Whilst the drop from the bridge to the road might be much greater than  feet roads are often cut into the ground reducing the amount of climbing you would be doing. In other words  feet still might be an underestimate but it might be closer to the truth than  feet.However what GPS device are you using?,Strava,cg2chlk,1,t5_2tnvh

1686308,0,t3_2dnk5x,Ive lost a bunch as well to people who openly admit they were motorpacing traveling in the slipstream of a vehicle usually scootermotorbike but they used a car giving a bigger space to sit in. As other people have said you know strava is a bit of fun and the KOMs can give you something to muck around and chase on your rides but it doesnt make this any less annoying.  It feels like when you all play a muck around game of football and guy turns up in full kit and nails everyone in every single tackle. Its not really against the rules it doesnt even mean anything but itd just be nice if they didnt.,Strava,cjrq24a,1,t5_2tnvh

3481303,0,t3_304e5e,Ive found the app to be very accurate in speed just not in elevation data or distance.Distance first  Using GPS Strava calculates distance point to point looking straight down.  So if point to point is exactly  mile thats what you get credit for.  However if that mile also included ft of climbing making it technically Im not going to do the math this early .mi of riding you still only get credit for  mile.  Thats why they tell you to ride mi or so for a mi challenge to make sure you get full credit.Elevation  its calculated using map data so its only that accurate.  If someone uses a Garmin with an altimeter Strava will usually consider that data to be trustworthy and give them full credit.  With GPS you could technically be climbing more or less than what youre given credit for.   Example   I have a ft climb nearby.  If I start Strava at the bottom ride up stop it I get credit for ft.  However if I do hill repeats each repeat is only good for ft because they like to smooth out peaks in the data in case there are errors.  If I did it with a Garmin and the Garmin added up ft on each climb then Strava would call that good data and give me full credit. Example   I have a ft climb that I always get ft of credit for because the map data shows the terrain going further down into a deep creek bed but doesnt account for the road that was built above it.  So where they steal elevation from me at one place I get it back elsewhere.Speed  always accurate.  I constantly improve my KOM times by looking at the average speed of the rider with the fastest time then just holding right above that average speed using my Cateye computer as a reference as I ride.  If I need to hit .mph for a stretch to get KOM Ill do exactly that and Stravas data is exact.,Strava,cpp3e1r,1,t5_2tnvh
3485097,0,t1_cpp43ut,The idea is that allowing people to comment would go hand in hand with verifying segments through community opinion. People would naturally comment on ones they think are important and all the crappy ones with bad start areas and duplicates wouldnt get much activity giving Strava an easy way to auto hide all the bad ones and promote the good ones.,Strava,cppiy2t,2,t5_2tnvh

Ive had to flag the last  rides of a local guy who finishes off his ultraslow railtrail rides with a fast car ride home all while leaving Strava running.Same thing every time  mph average speed for hr returns to the start point then suddenly turns into Lance as he hits mph uphill on the road away from the parking lot.Ive even messaged him and politely asked him to stop Strava before he gets in his car no response and just keeps doing it.

Theyll follow jet streams avoid jet streams and generally carve a more rounded arc on their journey.Ive seen Strava on flights before and they never have the mileage wrong. If its on it tracks.Never dull indeed.Which airline was it? Whered you end up? And why are there so many elevation changes within those  miles?
