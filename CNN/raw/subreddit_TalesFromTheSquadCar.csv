11469466,0,t1_dfvzvyb,All US states need to change multiple offenderpattern offender laws for drunkimpairedsuspended drivers.Take their cars. Jail anyone who hands over their own car keys to these fools. Refuse to allow newrenewed registrations.Driving is a privilege not a constitutional right.Constutional right to bail is bullshit. We have all seen bail denied on much lesser charges.Some of these pathetic excuses for human beings kill innocent adults and children. Many times they get off with involuntary manslaughter or vehicular manslaughter. BULLSHIT. Your ass knew you were impaired andor not permitted to drive.How many innocent drivers and families have to suffer before we learn to create real right now harsh punishment for these morons from jump?! No bail. Held over for trial. Huge fines. No license. Same penalties for morons who enable drunks and drug addicts in getting behind the wheel.If a getaway driver can be charged with felony murder a moron who gives or allows car key access to a drunkdrug user should also be charged with felony murder. Oh and before anyone pipes in...yes. BUZZED DRIVING IS DRUNK DRIVING and folks who do it have even less of an excuse than the fall down drunks.Yeah I am gonna go watch some old school Bugs Bunny Road Runner cartoons now.

And he has no requirement to admit who the friend was.Harder to say in a car where I can probably see you. Both you and his car would get the warrant. ,TalesFromTheSquadCar,dgebzy2,85,t5_31akb
