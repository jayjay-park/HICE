6074901,0,t1_cyfi9yi,No I think wed need you to bring the Augoror. Can you fit the rest of the doctrine? The fit should be in the mail that was sent about this fleet.,VulfpeckFleets,cyfwm3a,1,t5_3bcwb
6277804,0,t3_41kkyc,Rico will be there! Im interested to see if we can turn these into an ISK making fleet as well  I think with reduced numbers it could work out pretty well for ISK per pilot.,VulfpeckFleets,cz37rrt,1,t5_3bcwb
6362232,0,t1_czct4cw,SB would probably be the best option given the distance to travel and the fact that my alt is wardecced as well.  If you have an idea for a Caldari dessie fit that youd like to see I might be able to pull something together for that.,VulfpeckFleets,czctcvh,1,t5_3bcwb
6426209,0,t1_czjwkjt,o Awesome!  Guardian.Whats your ingame name btw ? you can add it as a flair to your user name . Since its the first time that you come to the fleet please make sure that you get the correct day for this fleet depending on your time zone added in the post,VulfpeckFleets,czk09wp,1,t5_3bcwb
6838268,0,t1_d0msq4l,Interesting... I was seeing my train into a Hyena as a path to a Rapier the Huginn would be an interesting bonus to that path.  Thanks Helios!,VulfpeckFleets,d0rf5n0,1,t5_3bcwb
6970925,0,t1_d14lt2g,I could potentially just make the main theme a dark one.  Dont really care to make it switchable.  Dont want to have to be testing two color schemes when I do things to make sure it looks good or is readable...lol.,VulfpeckFleets,d16hpe6,1,t5_3bcwb

7522971,0,t1_d2wv4dq,yeah I want that whoring drone as well  Luckily since I lost my ship at some point got on a few km at the end lol. Puni comp really strong with the numbers weve had. Start and reshipping was slow but then we chained the gf. Great fleet !,VulfpeckFleets,d2xbp8e,1,t5_3bcwb
