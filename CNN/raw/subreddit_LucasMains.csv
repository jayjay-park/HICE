6099868,0,t3_3z3cuj,Down b stalls for recovery are good. Youre typically gonna want to tether to ledge if youre close enough and saving your jump helps  Also you can cancel air dodge with tether to recover.,LucasMains,cyizr9a,1,t5_39bc7

8873432,0,t3_51n28a,If you land close to them utilt will catch your opponent out of shield offstage fairs are excellent edgeguarding tools you can bounce off a wall by hitting yourself with PK thunder then immediately upb again after hitting the wall but before going into freefall. the double up b is a great mixupantiedgeguarding tool kinda hard to learn the timing but easy after a few SDs lol but be wary of characters with a reflect or absorb.    ftilt is probably my favourite move at low percents the sour spot close to lucas between him and the hexagon animation combos into the sweet spot the hexagon itself and at higher percents you can build small combos off a sour ftilt. Also fltilt has a chance to trip sour spot only maybe not sure and comes out super fast.    Dtilt combos into itself until pretty high percents then usually jab combo ftilt or sh nair are good followups around  or  percent I will start to just do a single dtilt and then jab combo. Offstage I usually try to get an edgeguard with bair sh rar dair or a well timed dsmash at the ledge.    Also footstool stuff but I dont lab at all so I cant really tell you about that except footstool combos are sick and pretty viable with lucas in quite a few situations.    Lucas is my favourite DLC and main message me if you wanna practice  I love lucas dittos too.,LucasMains,d7egmfu,1,t5_39bc7
