10331933,0,t3_5nuo9e,mrs. hartoonian appreciates it im sure! i think if you spread the circle a bit more and give you a bit more room in the middle the tight radius will make the letters feel a little easier. i have the same struggle but when the circle gets too tight it helps to go smaller with the xheight.whatd you end up doing for the ink? just using pigmented white and cleaning it out right after?,calligraffiti,dcf6kh8,2,t5_2wxgt
