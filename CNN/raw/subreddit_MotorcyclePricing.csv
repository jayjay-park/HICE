3473940,0,t1_cpo5u42,What kind of a budget are you looking at? You can get into a cc that looks like a sport bike or a cruiser for under k easily. Just remember to factor in some gear insurance and some maintenance costs. As long as you arent hooning around on it you can get  miles out of a set of tires basic maintenance would include oil changes depending on the drive type can help keep costs low as well. Shaft drives dont have the instant power that chain drives do but require less servicing.,MotorcyclePricing,cpo96g9,1,t5_2wo1c
7465081,0,t3_4hfdyu,Id watch out. Looks a little frankenbike to me.Just looking the rear sprocket and chain are rusted. That seat is gonna be very uncomfortable. So think you might as well be sitting on the frame. Finally the handlebars are quite far forward from the seat. Youre gonna have a lot of lean depending on your frame. ,MotorcyclePricing,d2qqf4f,1,t5_2wo1c
