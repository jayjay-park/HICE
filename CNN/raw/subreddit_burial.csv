Have to look on the hard drive for the old rinse shows. there were more than a few burial tunes that were fragments of tunes that eventually became tracks on the first album and first ep.

6452670,0,t1_czmefmc,I think OP is referring to vaporwave like  and the like see Dream Catalogue. Artists like that lean closer to ambient music than anything else and are only vaporwave in name due to the fact that they use a lot of vaporwave stylings but their music isnt vaporwave in the traditional sense e.g. MACINTOSH PLUS  Chuck Person. If you listen to s Birth of a New Day youll hear ethereal pads and field recordings so it makes sense how OP came to the conclusion he did but those things arent really exclusive to Burial. ,burial,czmqxg5,2,t5_2sroq
