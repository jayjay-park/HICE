3277076,0,t3_2xmo88,I thought the first episode was hilarious. Just seeing what his character could come up with was great. I think I could watch him go crazy by himself for most of the episodes.

3443314,0,t1_cpiu2qr,gt Too many intros too soon.So you cant watch a show that has three characters established in the first four episodes? That pace is too much to handle? Ok well let me cross off the list of shows that establish more than three characters by their fourth episode because those are too frantic. Oh wait theres basically no shows left because thats pretty much ALL OF THEM. Or is this about the name? Youre feeling betrayed because it wasnt literal? The main character was so tired of being alone that he tried to kill himself before the first episode ended. The same way average tv viewers would want to kill themselves if they were watching one person talk to themselves for an entire season. I dont know why people think there is an exciting show in that. Its hard enough to get a movie length out of that premise without introducing another character or a dog the last of anything is never really the last of anything in these types of stories but somehow a tv show is supposed to do it for several episodes in a story chopped up once a week and keep people coming back? gt Ill check it out after a season has passed.Ahhh now I think I get it. Youre probably of the netflix generation youre more comfortable binge watching entire seasons and torrenting entire series never having to wait for a story to work itself out at the pace of a network tv show. The OP says the show is dragging and you say its too much too soon but I bet nobody would say either one if they could watch the entire season at once to see how all the pieces fit together. Instead we have a bunch of people who assume the writers have no idea what theyre doing or betrayed their original vision forgetting this was all written before it aired and just complain about the show its characters and its premise.,LastManonEarthTV,cpkrhzu,1,t5_377vu

Carol is creative and good at arts and crafts. She can be anything from an interior decorator to a fashion designer if she put her mind to it. Melissa has shown interest in working in waste removal and can work alongside new Phil in keeping the culdesac clean and sanitary. Todd as we know has a farming background and is gentle around animals which is necessary to balance New Phils more firm authoritative with animals. Erica calls herself a political nerd but I think her more useful skill is her interest in hiking and exploring. She could be out surveying the surrounding land for resources and other people alongside New Phil. And Gail of course is a cook. The all have skills that is all used together can help survive if they dont let their pettiness tear them apart which is exactly what is going on. ,LastManonEarthTV,cqry8fo,2,t5_377vu

Like Tandys arc this season I think shes starting to try to redeem herself. Her wearing Carols shoes were great too. Phil  grabbing a silent drink with Tandy was another subtle bit of redemption. He clearly still has issues with Tandy made even worse since he likely still has feelings for Carol but inviting him for a drink was a nice way to acknowledge appreciation despite the resentment. And Mike... Fucking heartbreaking.But those two major cliffhangers three if you include the marriage proposal... This show can sometimes feel like Lost. I cant wait another week to find out what happened!Is the virus back? Is that what caused Phil  to collapse? Maybe theyll explain more about the origins of the virus or at least why this particular group was immune.

9317993,0,t1_d8wrd55,I wasnt referring to that but rather how much time had elapsed between Mike leaving and the guys showing up on the boat.  As far as  I can recall they all acted as if he was going to die and seemed resigned to it.  Was Tandy acting like he was holding out hope in some way?,LastManonEarthTV,d8x4grw,1,t5_377vu
9322718,1,t1_d8wwh7x,I can say the same about your comment because it is the most worthless repetitive uninspired nonsensical comment. Youre just a terrible terrible person right down to the core. I get it somebody shits on you and you now go around and shit on other people. Know who does stuff like that? bad people like you.So soon as Phil goes to kill himself suddenly Carol appears Soon as hes married Melissa appears right before he has sex with Melissa suddenly Todd arrives. Einstein said If you cant explain it simply than you truly dont understand it and Sherlock Holmes often said the simplest answer is usually the answer. Taking both in account Last man on Earth is about an insane man trying to prove he can be a good person. Last man on earth isnt real. Its as obvious as Wilfred to Ryan. Everybody had this complicated theory and some serious tin foil hat stuff but it was obvious what the show was about but people didnt want to believe it.This is literally the RLJ theory and youre choosing to ignore it because it doesnt cater to what you think is worthy of a theory. It was obvious RLJ in GoT as it obvious phil is insane and all of this is just in his head.Take another thing in account. What happens if someone was the last person on earth. Would they be a good or bad person? What happens if they were a bad person and what if I said that person was Phil. Would you want the last person on earth to die as a bad person? even subconsciously? .. thats why phils subconscious is running the entire show. Generating people and their personalities based off phils own subconsciously to make the last person on earth die as decent human being. As we see Phil is slowly becoming less and less selfish and self absorbed and becoming more and more better.This show is like a road trip for the viewer except the viewer doesnt know the end destination of the road trip. So youre all along this journey thinking it will end somewhere else because the route were taking. The people who made this show know the beginning and end of this road trip but dont know the exact route or detours that may occur along the way. But dont be mistaken phil is insane and this is all in his head.BTW you didnt contribute to this content in any way. so I dont see why you feel the need to waste your time spewing hate speech. LOL! I am new to reddit and even I can read the column on the right hand side of the screen marked Rules and your literally ignored the first rules LOL! get a life and save your time and everybody elses and dont comment if youre just here to shit on people seriously. HAH youre just a bad person LOL. Youre just the worst type of person  more worse than a vegetarian.,LastManonEarthTV,d8xq1aj,-2,t5_377vu
9459675,0,t1_d9f2t66,Hes still an unbareable annoying ass to the group of course but the change is for the viewers. Like I couldnt stand Tandy on season  because how stupid he was but now hes my favorite character because how much of a lovable dummy he is.,LastManonEarthTV,d9f2xbl,16,t5_377vu
9617096,0,t3_5cps1y,That could be another reason shes spiraling. Her friends are getting pregnant and shes thinking about her child that she lost to the virus. That very well could have happened! If so that breaks my heart. Brings me to another sad idea. What if their babies arent immune? Just because both parents are doesnt mean they will be does it? Maybe thats too dark for this show and maybe Im wrong that they would all be immune coming from two immune parents?,LastManonEarthTV,d9yi6m1,20,t5_377vu

9646652,0,t3_5d032i,I dont think you understand the show.  The over the top aspect is part of the humor.  Its supposed to be ridiculous because the last man on Earth should be much more concerned with survival than with people liking him but all he really wants is approval.  ,LastManonEarthTV,da25ehd,2,t5_377vu
