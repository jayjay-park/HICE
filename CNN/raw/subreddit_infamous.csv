156639,0,t3_1vv1oq,Unfortunately you may have to contact Sony about this one. Or Sucker Punch if possible. Since the code expired its simply not going to work. Im sure if you give them proof that you bought it new theyll give you a super voucher code. Heres the link. Id suggest the live chat when you have time.

539210,0,t3_20adsv, I managed to watch the video in the few minutes it was up and Ill share what I saw.Obviously. SPOILERS!!!!Below is massive SPOILER ZONE   I was a bit disappointed to only see one new power I was hoping hed upload a few more videos before it got taken down but oh well. The prologue starts with Desmond on the coast where he lives. Im unsure whether or not this area will be exportable when the world opens up or if it was just a zone that is loaded for the prologue and dont return to. The story starts with an escaped convict jumping Desmond and holding him hostage while his brother tries to talk him down. Sure enough desmond absorbs his fire power things get crazy and desmond has a confrontation with him where Im sure gameplay mechanics are explained. Then a spiffy older lady in a fancy suit shows up with the conduit police Or whatever theyre called to clean up the situation. She uses her powers of Concrete Looks like stone really to torture Desmond because she thinks hes holding out information on her. Then you have your first major GOODEVIL choice of the game to either give yourself up or to hold out and sacrifice the other people in your tribe. The player chose evil and then we saw her using her concrete powers to start torturing some old lady. Was only ish minutes long. Not much revealed. Oh well.  days. ,infamous,cg1kcj5,2,t5_2siyw

601389,1,t3_20zdof,Id say its an okay game.Im not blown away.  Its a  GAME.  The visuals are very pretty but fall flat hard in places.  And its kind of obvious how they try and make the game look better than it is turning to night when you get neon powers for the first time for example lots of lowlying sun to make the world look all artsy and pretty.Bit too much of a tech demo that doesnt quite work for me. FPS is killing me though and its struggling to maintain it. I dont care what the reviews say I dont care what the fanboys say Digital Foundry will show that the game has an average FPS of below  I guarantee it.Ive been playing Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes today as well with some Diablo  thrown in for my fix and its SUCH a glaring difference in feel and smoothness.I really REALLY hate  FPS.  How a game like MGS to me a better looking game too can run at  FPS constant is pretty damn impressive.Infamous feels like its chugging along at times and its really affecting my enjoyment. There are certainly times where Ive thought Okay now THAT is pretty. but its few and far between so far.And my PS sounds like a jet engine when playing as the fans are working overtime.I also feel like theres..just..nothing IN the world.  Once youve wiped out the DUP in the area got all the hilariouslyeasytoget shards and done the side missions etc I just feel like well no reason to EVER come back here again.A feeling of lack of content is engulfing me.,infamous,cg8mqlv,0,t5_2siyw
