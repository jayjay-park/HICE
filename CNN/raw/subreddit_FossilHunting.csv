Like the others mentioned I have had success at Westmoreland but while they have a large variety of fossils its not where Ive ever found a ton. George Washingtons Birthplace is fullll of fossils however you have to be careful as it is Federal Land and they can and will give you a ticket for collecting fossils. I know as Ive gotten a ticket there before. If you do decide to go to George Washingtons Birthplace go across the creek as that is not their property and they cannot ticket you for collecting teeth there. Ive found large Makos and some Megalodon teeth there.,FossilHunting,ch654pq,2,t5_2ukah
