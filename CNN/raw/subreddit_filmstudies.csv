1256241,0,t1_ciarq5x,I can see your point entirely unfortunately I have handed it in now and I decided to take the route of the mob which is made of predominantly white ItalianAmerican and at points some Irish and Polish jews. I suppose it was more in adherence with your last point as I had chopped and changed some of the films involved to draw emphasis upon a repressed individual as a cog in a much larger machine.I thought my seventies chapter was a little less renowned but I see where youre coming from the choices were due in part to help develop a communication between myself and the marker through many films that they had probably seen. In terms of the urban crime thriller I am a huge fan Menace II Society  being one of my personal favourites and Ill be reaquainting myself with Juice tonight. The initial problem with those films although apt was that the chain of command was different or nonexistant and their criticism lies more in line with individuals rather than a larger power structure.Thank you for taking the time to replyThashicray,filmstudies,ciaxxe3,2,t5_2uq7s
