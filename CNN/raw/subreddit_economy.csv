This avoids both inflation and deflation.  The problem is that your suggestion requires more central control which always leads to corruption.  It would be absolutely impossible for any human to this properly and close to impossible to program a computer to do properly.  I wouldnt never recommend a system where small group of powerful men control the creation of money.However what youre describing is what sort of happened naturally when gold was used as a currency.  In booming economic times when the economy was growing gold mining industry would pick up.  As the economy grew the supply of money grew.  When times were bad and the economy started contracting gold mining would scale back as well.  This was at least a market solution that didnt involve a group of powerful secret men behind a curtain.  However it wasnt perfect.Regardless while bitcoin may not be the final endall solution to our troubling modern monetary problems I believe it is absolutely a better system than our centrally controlled corrupt topdown legally enforced fiat money system.I have my reasons why I think the bitcoin protocol will change the world and you may have your reasons why you dont believe it will but its kind of useless to argue because only time will tell.

Competition ensures that the customerscitizens have control over a favorable outcome for themselves which is higher value for their energytimemoney. Government  as a monopoly  proves itself to be worse than its competitors by often making it illegal to compete with government services. Here in the USA the post office has a legal monopoly on st class and bulk rate mail which prevents Fedex and UPS from interfering with that highly profitable sector and the economies of scale that daily delivery comes with reduction of package delivery.One very clear example in the USA where a business competed with the government is in the s with abolitionist Lysander Spooners American Letter Mail Company which drove the price of st class mail from c to c between Boston and NYC. They were the ones charging c while the govt was charging c who were then compelled to reduce their rates to c and illegalize the ALMC.,economy,chbjtu1,2,t5_2qhpn

Take for example a  loan paid back over  yearsgt  payments are     gt . payments are gtSo the payment increased  a month or . that is an extra  a yearWell first of all youre calculating on a selfamortizing loan where payments start immediately i.e. interest is not piling up on interest on top of the principal sans payments for X years.And secondly even there the difference is NOT as trivial as the slight change in payments makes it seem.The difference in total interest paid on your example   total interest is .      . total interest is .Thats . more in total interest.Now do what many perhaps most students do and throw that into deferred payment for  years... and the effect of that little . starts to become even more significant.

NOW thats an additional     in total interest or an additional  months worth of payments again provided they actually ARE making the full payment and in a timely fashion many dont do either at least not initially. Given that reality  that many students not only DEFER payments for several years postgraduation that is if they even graduate and somewhere around  dont instead they drop out... but while their dreams of a degree go poof the loan due doesnt  but then in addition they make minimum payments i.e. NOT fullselfamortizing but only was is required to not go into default...

Lenders have seen overall stability come back to the market since the recession and leasing has gradually returned as a larger part of many lender strategies.On the one hand  since the majority of the market has no clue how to budget amp save for the proper maintenance amp repair of an older car in many cases even an unexpected repair of under  is impossible for them  the idea of leasing a brandnew and therefore under warranty vehicle certainly appears on the surface to make good financial sense.But of course there are caveats little gotchas in those leases that are just waiting to be sprung at lease end  even for those who manage to maintain the payments  again from the Forbes articlegtgtWhile the cost of a newcar lease is based largely on the available interest rate and a given models residual value automakers and leasing companies can manipulate other provisions of the agreement to help sweeten the deal on a given model. Called subventing a lease this often involves subsidizing a belowmarket interest rate artificially inflating a vehicles residual value or offering bonus cash to lower a cars transaction price.gtgtAnother way automakers can lower a leases monthly payment is to reduce the number of annual miles allowed. This is typically  miles per year though some leases might include as few as  annual miles. Be sure not to enter a lease that unduly limits your mileage  particularly if you have a distant daily commute or like to take long road trips  as it may cost you dearly down the road. Depending on the lease terms you could be assessed as much as an extra  to  cents a mile for exceeding the limit which means youd have to come up with  to  per  extra miles on the odometer at the end of the lease. However those who worry they might exceed the stated annual mileage can often purchase additional miles up front at a discounted rate.gtgtBe aware that if you tend to be hard on your car or truck think twice before leasing one. Leased vehicles must be returned in excellent condition without dents deep scratches window cracks or torn upholstery and with all accessories in good working order otherwise youll be assessed costly excessive wear and tear fees.Keep in mind that even just  cents a mile for any vehicle that gets  MPG and  cents a mile for virtually ANY vehicle is MORE than the cost of gasoline... the cost of which everyone constantly complains and the latter gasoline occurs throughout the life of the vehicle whereas the excessive mileage hits as a lump sum at the end of the lease.Moreover what are the chances that the kind of person who is unable to properly maintain amp keep in repair an older vehicle... is going to keep a leased vehicle in excellent condition? Or have saved up enough cash to cover the additional excessive mileage and wear amp tear costs at lease end?They really wont... hence they will be essentially bound to at least attempt to rollover as much of that as possible into yet another likely even worse terms amp conditions leased vehicle  a form of perpetual indenture with ever increasing risks of default and zero asset value at the end.EDIT And from OPs article...gtgtSure these new cars come fully loaded and are virtually spaceships but it will cost you especially when the per capita wage in the country is approximately . Given that the average new car costs  most people need to go into debt to finance this purchase. We are now seeing a big wave of subprime borrowers purchasing cars. What can possibly go wrong?It really OUGHT to be obvious that the above is not a sustainable picture the math simply does NOT work out the only way a person making k a year can possibly carry the purchaselease of a k vehicle is if they have virtually ZERO other financial commitments i.e. they have a job but live for free in mummy andor daddys basement.Moreover it is often worse than the above seems to indicate  locally I see several families driving not just one but TWO or more such leasedsubprimefinanced brand new vehicles either while renting a house minimum monthly cost of gt  AND subject to rather arbitrary annual increases or while barely making their home payments again typically a minimum monthly cost of gt ... plus taxes insurance and repairs.Much as with the housing bubble people MAY be able to keep the juggling act going for a few years... but the instant one of the balls drops in an unexpected manner...,economy,cjb0o70,2,t5_2qhpn

This has a twobarreled force depressing inflation. First it prevents the need to print money domestically to pay the debt. Second the selling of debt effectively increases the foreign supply of US dollars. However depressing inflation just causes money to find another outlet and that is the increasing amplitude of economic corrections. Because inflation has been artificially depressed the increasing gap between the rich and poor has replaced it as the canary in the mine warning that there is too much money as the money trickles up to the rich but there isnt enough sustainable economy to reinvest in to bring the rest of the people up.The politicians know this well because it allows them to spend money to buy votes especially in the worst of economic times when they can just sell more debt.,economy,cm1gckt,3,t5_2qhpn

2803230,0,t3_2s6y0o,The rest of the discussion had to split it up it was too long for  post.Shad Walker No it is highly centralized on some aspects. But that isnt a bad thing perse. Even businesses use a highly centralized model and people have been trained to think of Governmental Centralization as a bad thing... which dont get me wrong it can be in bad hands.For example take the tale of King Author. A monarchydictatorship cant get much more centralized then that. But it was still a fairly peaceful kingdom that did well for its citizens.Businesses know the advantage of central control and planning having all the information flow to one central location so decisions can be made for a bigger picture.So on the hard logistics I was speaking of highly centralized in that regaurd.On the social aspects... honestly I havent thought of that part to a great extent. But mulling over it now I would say more at a local level. For example if the people of a particular town  city ship want a nudist locale as opposed to a nonnudist locale that would be up to them. The important thing is just not to get your distaste of certain lifestyles carried so far away that it disrupts the flow of the big picture.Nudists and homosexual pose no threat to the system environment or life as we know it. Ghandi showed that different religions can live and work together. I know what an idea all those religions that teach love and peaceful living and the followers actually do it and help create another Golden Age of man.So for those kinds of aspects I would say decentralized.Technocratic to an extent once again for some of the hard logistics. Since many things would be automated set maintenance schedules could be set up. In agriculture the machinescomputers could check the condition of the soil and quickly determine what would be the best crop to grow there at that time.So really it would be a mix take the good and leave the bad so to speak. Use an appropriate type system for the job at hand and integrate them in a cohesive fashion could be another way of saying it. Mira Siente I agree with dont get stuck on the small stuff like individual preference. But when it comes to centralization we have very little control over who or what is influencing their decisions who will or will not eat today or who will or will not be free today live tomorrow. All of these decisions are taking place today in a semicentralized society. How can we guarantee that we have the right people in those higher up positions. Also thanks for the enlightening conversation. Shad Walker You can never really guarantee that that is just life. The best we can do is try to mitigate it as best we can. Like I said the hard sciences are easy and we produce more then enough food for all so that isnt even a problem.Shad Walker Hence why we automate much of the hard sciences there it really is in nobodys hands perse the logistics decide. Freedom is  of the social issues technically everybody would be free. There would still be crime and punishments hence why I see  zones an exile zone for people that cant be part of society for a variety of reasons.Mira Siente How do people exile other people and with what enforcement? Where would the zone be located? What country or continent? who decides who lives in zone  r ?Shad Walker This way the corrupting mechanic of power and money are taken out of the equation though. What influence is there to be a corrupt politician like this? There is no money so you cant be bought off. The automation and match dictate the resources so nobody is able to bogart them.Shad Walker For purposes of your questions I will assign Zone  as the democratic RBE society zone  as the for lack of a better term at the moment anarchical zone and zone  as the exile zone.Shad Walker So zone  wouldnt be to highly different then what we know today we would still have a police force and laws such as no murdering. As to the location of each zone I dont have an exact answer for you. I think we would need to look into that with some geologists and other such scientists to figure out how to divvy up the planet if we were to go that route also this is talking endgame along the path it might just be countries jumping on board so it would be that collection of countries. Shad Walker As for who decides who lives in zone  or zone  well each individual does. You are free to decide if you are born in zone  you can stay or leave to zone . Part of the reason why I want to see basic wilderness livingsurvival as part of the regular school education.Shad Walker Humans have always passed along their knowledge to the later generations of what they have learned and one of the basics that we have stopped teaching is living in nature. And that is what really gives every person the ability to be free the knowledge of how to be independent of toys and society. How to keep yourself alive in the most basic of situations.Shad Walker If a person is born in zone  but wishes to come see what zone  is like and possibly even become part of that society they are welcome to.Shad Walker With the level of tech we are talking about and the number of people that are on the planet im guesstimating a  hour work week. And that was the point of all this tech we have been building wasnt it? To make life easier and workdays shorter?Shad Walker And as to choice of jobs well it isnt too different. I still see schooling along with testing involved. Make sure the person has the skills to pay the bills so to speak. Plenty of artisan jobs too after all we do like entertainment and such.Shad Walker Zone  I was imagining putting it so it wouldnt have adjacent borders with zone . More less just out of courtesy didnt want to stick exiled murderers and such right into zone .Mira Siente In order to really contemplate this idea we need to have a debate on crime and punishment. The current prison and rehabilitation lack of efforts plus profit motives have really messed up what society defines as who is criminal and who is not. Some believe prisons should abolished and that we rethink punishment. Good start though on getting the ideas down and articulating it. I dont see this getting alot of attention anywhere but I know there are people working on this in some places. Its very futuristic and not practical right now on the larger scale plus there are some powerful forces blocking it.. I am definitely for promoting survival skills and living more naturally. I think its why people are so depressed angry and full of anxiety. We can point to this direction of living in many ways. Shad Walker Logistically it is practical as far as resources and tech go even today. It is the socialhuman part that is troublesome. Yea society would have to hammer out what laws it would implement. But if we are really to be a Free at least as close as we humanly can society that means socially liberal.Shad Walker Such as drugs pretty much all drugs would be legal... but you would be properly educated about the pros and cons of the different drugs from an early age. We get rid of the forbidden fruit syndrome and if someone decides to play to much well hey you knew the game. Roll your dice and play they land where they land.Mira Siente better detox and recovery programs than we have now. This group of society has been written off by the people in charge.Shad Walker It would probably become less of an issue. If you look to the Euro countries that have decriminalized it and such they have lower addiction rates then the USA. Also much of that stems from other issues the drug use is a symptom of other pains. A way to numb or get away from those issues.Shad Walker So if you address the root cause of the depression  pain ie financialpoverty less people useabuse such things since they dont have that driving force to escape from.Mira Siente it would naturally declineShad Walker We are a socialpack creature.

2898686,0,t1_cnxe1ym,A real economy is driven by demand and supply. Theres two trains of thought generally Demandside and Supplyside economics.Supplyside can be seen in products like the original iPhone  you build a product that is innovative and produce a market. Generally this is best described if you build it they will come. Its difficult to predict and often times requires brilliance. Then theres demand. Aggregate Demand AD is CIGXM. That is Consumer Spending plus Business Investment plus Government Spending plus the difference of Exports and Imports. Fiscal Policy is all about temporarily increasing Government Spending because often a temporary stimulus in AD will spur consumer spending. It also can fix some of the underlying problems like costs of doing business which can result in increased Business Investment as they expand their operations instead of having to fix more vehicles and pay higher and higher utilities costs. In essence the best fiscal policy this assumes the major problem is that people arent feeling great about the economy and there is no structural problem to get people back on track would be road repairs grants to fix public buildings grants to lay fiber put up power lines fix municipal water supplies etc. This will increase consumer confidence more money injected back into the economy and things seem better and after a lag should all other things held equal create more consumer spending. ,economy,cnxl3s6,1,t5_2qhpn

Many will be going to push back the edges of human knowledge.. or to create things which they are proud of.Most of the remaining work will look like research or art does today.Scientists often work because they enjoy doing what they do.There are better motivators than money for example altruism.How we deal with the economics is a completely different issue and one which I dont think anybody has a clue what to do about. We should be discussing it though because these changes are occurring very rapidly and the need to figure out what to do will be upon us before we know it.Denial is really irresponsible.,economy,corwpsk,4,t5_2qhpn

3219779,0,t1_covpu9p,I disagree. Regulation couldve added more transparency to the marketplace.The main problem the Financial Industry faced as it went into the crisis was that it exhausted the supply of reliable borrowers. They got over that by loaning to bad borrowers and ceasing their homes when they failed to pay. As housing prices seemed to be perpetually increasing the banks could turn a profit making up for the money they lost lending to the buyer based on an earlier lower price with the revenue they gained selling it at a later higher price. The price of homes inflated and eventually crashed and the banks lost a lot of money.If the buyers had known what they were getting into and if perveyors of this disgusting practice brought to justice a lot of damage could have been prevented.,economy,covqdna,0,t5_2qhpn

3351891,0,t1_cpaaq1p,Technology does create a lot of jobs. There is no question about it. But numerically the number is much smaller than the ones which no longer are relevant. For example innumerable electromechanical devices existed for decades and an entire service culture built up around them now they are being replaced by computing devices that emulate them requiring an entirely different skillset that some can learn but many others arent prepared for. We would be wise to start teaching kids technology at a much earlier age so they grow up knowing it. using it.  Even so we should not have any illusions as to what level of skill will get somebody a paying job. It will be much higher than it was in the recent past. I am expecting that in some areas people with what we would consider MS level knowledge will enjoy a good job outlook and be employable. But only in a few very demanding fields. The bottom will fall out of the job market due to commodification of the bulk of jobs that will still be done by people. they will be outsourced to service firms based overseas and employing very low wage service workers. They will have to pay local minimum wages though. It will be hard on them too because they will leave family behind. Their governments will like it though because it increases inequality and hierarchy governments like that. Here and there.Also there will be no money in repair or sales. Sales will be direct machine to machine and repair will be rare and only undertaken for irreplaceable high quality tech..or for sentimental reasons. Cheap devices will be literally a dime a dozen. Everybody will know how to use them. Academic fields will be divided into people with tenure and everybody else. Public education will be privatized and all of the contracts from the previous regime will have to be dumped because they will violate national treatment and be too restrictive. So will all other carve outs and  basically over time every kind of contract that exists now will be voided as blocking trade.  The other side of the coin is that a great many changes which otherwise would occur under democracy will be blocked under FTA faux democracy and ISDS. Changes which would improve conditions will be barred by the FTAs as indirect expropriation. They will say that we should not have passed the FTA is we wanted to be able to change things in the future. Also what do you think about this,economy,cpac9ir,1,t5_2qhpn

Serfs were often required not only to work on the lords fields but also his mines forests and roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society and the Lord of the Manor and his serfs were bound legally economically and socially. Serfs formed the lowest social class of feudal society.gtThe decline of serfdom in Western Europe has sometimes been attributed to the Black Death which reached Europe in   although the decline had begun before that date. Serfdom became increasingly rare in most of Western Europe after the Renaissance but conversely it grew strong in Central and Eastern Europe where it had previously been less common this phenomenon was known as later serfdom.gtIn Eastern Europe the institution persisted until the midth century. It persisted in the Austrian Empire till  and was abolished in Russia in .  In Finland Norway and Sweden feudalism was not established and serfdom did not exist however serfdomlike institutions did exist in both Denmark the stavnsbnd from  to  and its vassal Iceland the more restrictive vistarband from  until .gtAccording to Joseph R. Strayer the concept of feudalism can also be applied to the societies of ancient Persia ancient Mesopotamia Egypt Sixth to Twelfth dynasty Muslim India China Zhou Dynasty and end of Han Dynasty and Japan during the Shogunate James Lee and Cameron Campbell describe the Chinese Qing Dynasty  as also maintaining a form of serfdom. gtTibet is described by Melvyn Goldstein to have had serfdom until    but whether or not the Tibetan form of peasant tenancy qualified as serfdom was widespread is contested.   Bhutan is described by Tashi Wangchuk a Bhutanese civil servant as abolishing serfdom officially by  but Wangchuk believes less than or about  of poor peasants were in copyhold situations. gtUnited Nations  Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery also prohibits serfdom as a form of slavery.gtgtImage iInteresting History of serfdom | Serfdom in Russia | The Road to Serfdom | Abolition of serfdom in Poland Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcpwmzx oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecpwmzx.

Maybe the requirement of a warrant is a constraint placed by the government on people ie the police officers? and Edward Coke was an individual placing constraints on government?

Its entirely possible that all these last minute changes in minimum wages will be nullified by the WTO in the near future. Thats what they did in the s when a similar change was made in El Salvador right before they signed a trade deal. They could even tell us to get rid of our minimum wages or face sanctions if they have the effect of excluding foreign services firms set up to service specific markets in the soon to be privatized and globalized public sector.

Theres an incredible amount of sacrifice and talent with top CEOs around the world. They get paid that much for good reason. At the same time many people dont understand this. So it creates resentment with some of the workers.Again on the other side it also motivates employees to work harder to achieve that goal of getting the big bucks. Anyway our team of  MBA program at Old Dominion University in Norfolk VA had to go through a lot of peer reviewed research articles and the conclusion is this high CEO pay does some good in the short run attract talentmotivate employees and ultimately hurts you in the long run disparity becomes glaringcultural shift in the US.Also to Medvededstudies have shown that high CEO salaries mean that higher level execs and even managers are more likely to be paid a greater amount than the average worker.

Our countryspecific instruments are i global capital flows interacted with individual countries financial openness and ii the growth rate of official reserves. We find that a real appreciation depreciation reduces raises significantly annual real GDP growth more than in previous estimates in the literature.

If businesses dont know whats going to be happening in the future they wont be taking out as many loans for new capital investments or increasing headcount.  If they arent hiring then the employees dont have as much wealth to feed back into goods and services which depresses demand for businesses.  If they arent taking loans then the banks arent creating money with the magic of fractional reserve banking.  Similarly many banks are going to be much more reluctant to float loans to British companies or companies that do a lot of business with the UK  which could cause those companies to fail to refinance their debt and collapse.Yes the Great Recession was mainly capped off by billions of dollars of CDOs and MBSs turning out to be worth nothing or less than nothing.

The whole perspective that the world belongs to the people etc etc. The whole premise of wage slavery is the fact that workers and normal people own nothing and only have enough income to live that puts them as unequal compared to people who owns actually assets like land companies ideas and means of production etc. Companies cannot be valued equally as with people.

9586752,0,t3_5c93tw,I will describe two approaches to raising wages Republican JOBS!  High employment.  Companies at this time are already having trouble finding workers at . unemployment.  As this number is driven down further every type of worker can demand higher pay as workers are in short supply.  Before long everyone from doctors and CEOs at the top to accountants and teachers to laborers at the bottom start making more money.  Now ALL products and services are going to cost more money and the inflation will effectively offset the wage gains of all.  We all ran a marathon and ended up in the same place. Democrats  Increasing minimum wage leads to price increases in industries that are heavily dependent on unskilled labor.  There are not that many people actually at minimum wage but expect fast food food in general lowtech manufacturing cleaning services child care etc. to increase prices.  Thriving cities generally already pay above minimum wage but the lowest paid may see their pay get bumped up.  Also I would expect to see the guygals making close to the minimum wage also see a pay increase.  Because of their higher skill if they were making  more than the lowest paid at their company they still want to see that their hard work and skill is worth more than the lowest paid among them.  If the minimum wage increases to  for example I would expect to see some wage increases for all workers in the minimumto range being very general here with some compression of the wage scale at the bottom end.  But there is really no need for much wage increase for accountants scientists engineers and CEOs.So the minimum wage increase will cause some localizedspecific cost inflations but overheating the economy st example will essentially cancel out wage increases thru across the board inflation.,economy,d9urh5a,1,t5_2qhpn

And with debt you need to consider assets that debt buys and the earning potential that represents. There is a reason the US is the gold standard of fiat currencies. We shouldnt hold so much debt that I agree with but the answer isnt cutting social security Medicaid Medicare planned parenthood and selling the ecology. We should go back to the time when we were most successful between the ss and emulate the tax structure. That means massive increases on taxes to the wealth and tax decreases to the middle class. Its not a theory. We have a very long historic example to look at.Its not that we spend too much. Those assets have great value. Its that we stopped paying for it. ,economy,dd0nlmp,2,t5_2qhpn

10535342,0,t1_dd1yx7a,Economists like to claim that the purpose of free trade is to eliminate barriers that impair the efficient global allocation of resources while helping some of the worlds poorest people. Its an argument undermined by a simple thought experiment. Suppose we wiped the slate clean of the TransPacific Partnership the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and other similar trade deals and the worlds trade negotiators banged their heads to figure out the best way of achieving their stated goals. What would they be negotiating about?Tariffs? Rules on intellectual property rights? Investment regulations?None of the above. They would go instead after barriers to international labor mobility and try to hammer out a deal over some kind of temporary work visa plan along the lines I describe in an academic paper I recently published. There is practically nothing that would do more to enlarge the economic pie nationally and globally while improving the global distribution of income.Of course anything like that would be wildly unrealistic in the current political climate. But I bring up the thought experiment to illustrate that trade negotiations are only loosely about what they purport to be about enhancing economic efficiency and economic opportunities. The problem with the present trade regime is not that it sacrifices the political and the social for the economic it is that it has never made much sense from the economic perspective either. Which is why its a mistake to judge realword trade agreements strictly on economic terms rather than social or political ones.In some sense we all know this. Consider another thought experiment Suppose Harry and John own two companies that compete with each other. How do you feel about each of the following four cases?Harry works really hard saves and invests a lot comes up with new techniques and outcompetes John resulting in John and his employees losing their jobs.Harry gets a competitive edge over John by finding a cheaper supplier in Germany.Harry drives John out of business by outsourcing to a supplier in Bangladesh which employs workers in hour shifts and under extremely hazardous conditions.Harry imports Bangladeshi workers under temporary contracts and puts them to work under conditions that violate domestic labor environmental and safety laws.From a purely economic standpoint these scenarios are what economists call isomorphic  they are formally indistinguishable because each creates losers as well as winners in the process of expanding the economic pie in the national economy. That is Harrys gains are larger than Johns losses.But most people react very differently to these scenarios. The manner in which the gains and losses are generated matter to them. In particular scenarios  and  appear problematic insofar as they produce competition that violates ground rules that have been set at home.Furthermore scenario  would be clearly illegal but no different in its practical consequences from scenario . This raises the question of why we should be OK with scenario  while most observers would regard  as unconscionable.The point of this second thought experiment is to suggest that certain kinds of international competition can undermine domestic norms with regards to whats an acceptable redistribution. A similar thing happens when competition from tax havens undermines a domestic tax regime or when imports from jurisdictions with poor safety enforcement undermine domestic consumer safety rules.Its important to distinguish between two versions of an argument as to why trade may be problematic from a social or political perspective. Some suggest trade is problematic because it redistributes income. The basis for that claim is true but trivial. Pretty much everything else that happens in a market economy somehow redistributes income. Technology and market competition are the sources of endless churns in an economy. Moreover plenty of other things including skillbiased innovation and minimumwage laws have vastly greater effects on income distribution than trade.So it makes very little sense to set international trade apart and decouple it from other domains or approaches for dealing with inequality in labor markets at large progressive tax systems active labor market policies employmentfriendly macro policies etc.. Imports from Germany may adversely affect domestic companies that are displaced but theres no reason to treat the people who lose out any differently from workers who are adversely affected by say technological innovation. There is a coherent justification for compensating the losers of free trade for reasons of solidarity and equity but the justification would apply in the case of innovation. Consequently the preferred remedies should be the same as well.,economy,dd2apq2,2,t5_2qhpn

Which should not come as any surprise when you consider that the US also has the largest economy by GDP on the planet. Even if the US matched its defense spending to European nations as a percentage of GDP it would still outspend any nation on earth when it comes to defense spending by a very large margin. If you picked just about any single country and swapped their economy with that of the US I guarantee you that their defense spending would nearly match that of the US because thats simply the world we live in. Unless like Ive said you have some plan to make world peace a reality.gt but we dont have health care which every western industrialized nation does.gt gt Forty five thousand people die in the US every year because we do not have Universal Health CareI take it you dont realize that the US is already set to spend . trillion in  on healthcare alone. Our healthcare spending is already greater than most economies on the planet So youve just about gotten your wish already. Two thirds of the entire  year budget for a fighter program is already being spent yearly at this point on healthcare in the US. Thats of course also ignoring the fact that the US already massively outspends every other nation on healthcare. So its my belief that instead of wasting your energy trying to fight an inevitable weapons program you should focus your efforts on fixing how existing healthcare funds are being spent. Unless youre OK with furthering someone elses agenda whom youve had no input on.gt We lost  soldiers in the entire Vietnam War.And fewer US soldiers have died in all combined military conflicts in the last half century since by a very significant margin.gt there doesnt seem to be anything heregt gt That is an understatement.gt gt Isnt it?gt gt You have one go to shallow phrase to justify the waste of money to enrich those who profit on war and thats it!gt gt Thats all you got!This response speaks volumes with how you intended on approaching this issue. It seems to me that you didnt want to actually have any kind of meaningful dialogue. If would you like to actually refute that US national healthcare spending already surpasses that of any other country on the planet or that a strong military does not actually have any impact on global peace please be my guest.

11336987,0,t1_dfh0jzy,But again its not about cutting off supply.  We subsidize oil companies to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars to make their oil a cheaper alternative to renewable energy.  If we forced them to stand on their own merits if we stopped selling them acres of land for pennies on the dollar to suck dry if we stopped allowing things like these pipelines to make their product cheaper while we the American people and humanity at large are suffering the consequences and reaping none of the benefits then renewables would have started surpassing fossil fuels a decade ago.Its not about cutting off the supply its about balancing the playing field AND holding the companies accountable for the damage they cause to the environment.  If we allow them to build this pipeline we should be charging them for every ounce that flows through it and using that money to fund renewable energy and research into combating climate change.  And not charging them a pittance charging them a LOT.  And the same for every inch of federal land it crosses.  And none of this token BP fine bullshit if something goes wrong if something happens and there is a spill we need to hold them entirely financially responsible and to straight up freeze their finances until the issue is resolved.

They are making profits hand over fist here.  We cant possibly change the demand for this when we keep letting them get away with murder so that they can sell us  a gallon gas.edit And a quick note just to be clear here.  People keep saying that the oil is there and someone is going to get it out but if that happens if we cant find a financial or political way to stop those tar sands from being extracted then its too late.  If all of the oil up there is extracted and burned society as we know it is over.  This is not hyperbole this is scientific consensus.  There are huge vast amounts of oil up there and if we were to extract and burn them all the damage would be irreparable and unstoppable.

11346447,0,t1_dfhrh8v,Im sorry but this is poor understanding of economics and where the money is going like you just finished Econ  taught by a super conservative teacher level of understanding. For one look at Seattle. Weve had a rising minimum wage and their has not been a loss in jobs and the minimum wage has out paced the costs of goods. There has not been a net increase of ZERO like many people keep trying to suggest. In fact their was a recent article about a Forbes writer that kept moving his goalpost back over the years on his articles about his Seattle predictions because the data kept proving him wrong.nd as wages have stagnated and inflation increased across the country corporate profits have also increased. Many people look at minimum wage as a check on corporate and business owner greed. They are not paying people properly often relying on taxpayers to pick up the rest of the bill and thus have seen their profits continue to grow while the rest of us have seen our buying power decrease. rd with a minimum wage increase you would possibly see prices go up some but some profits would go down because that money is going to the people who make those businesses their money. That being said you have a greater supply of money in circulation buying goods and services. The rich people dont simply reinvest all of the money they make like conservative economic theory thinks. In reality most of it just gets stockpiled away in banks not being used. When you give people at the bottom more money you see an economy grow because they tend to spend their money and save less.th if you simply take a look at European countries that have mandated liveable wages you can see that countries do survive just fine and are better off because of it. Great article comparing fast food workers in the US vs Denmark.th people need to ask themselves on a level of morality is it cool to pay someone so little they cannot survive by work full time at a job?
