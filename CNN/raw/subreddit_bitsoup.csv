7137554,0,t1_d1pdiug,Ha ya thats what I was considering as well. Last year before Lights Out was implemented they took votes to see if people wanted a subscription based system for the site. They also discussed the idea in the forums and while begging for donations. They eluded to it further towards the end of the year when they insisted Big changes were coming.Personally I think the Lights Out system is a two fold experiment to gain money for the site and those that control it and to see how many people would buy into a subscription based BitSoup. I suspect they realized that they may loose too many users by outright switching to a paid only system and so they decided Lights Out would be a good way to ease into the idea and see how many people would pay. Further evidence of this is the fact that they started by occasionally having Lights Out active and then last week it was on most of the time. And additional evidence of this is shown in their lack of caring about users who dont donate as shown in the announcement on .While I totally disagree with how they are going about this the lying and disrespect for the community is horrible Im not reporting anything to anyone as I dont  agree with bringing the RIAA or anyone else official into this. Bringing unwanted attention to private trackers in general is bad for everyone and while its not likely authorities would act on it theyd have a collection of IPs and likely donor contributions associated with members of the site too. The best thing we can do is educate people about the scam they are running.,bitsoup,d1pgndq,9,t5_3d3ue

The most important customers for the new incarnation of bitscam will be the ones that have say  months left on their memberships.

8913698,0,t3_51onjy,Hi everyone! I too am a member from the ILT shit palace. Ive been there for about  or so years and it was my very first private tracker man I was so excited. A few years ago some such schemethreatextortion was happening on the site and there was even a thread where members were speaking up but then I saw people were being banned and it was all getting censored. Many of us just fell silent. I never felt any kind of community over there and even believed that was just how it was supposed to be. A couple of years ago I started to wake up to the fact that ILT is a scam. After this stunt I am so glad I found this sub! I really appreciate the information I have found here so far. Any chance a tracker will openly take us in? And for fellow refugees of ILT how is the hunt going? Thank you all again!,bitsoup,d7janz9,3,t5_3d3ue

As always my deepest thanks to our sources Thank you        Having had a good read through this Im appalled as to how many of their members are actually contemplating moving over to their super secret lair otherwise known to us all as GimmePeers however I couldnt help but chuckle at Rodster the User who apparently claims hes going to join them on the new site never donated before amp hes in their lowest class of membership but apparently hes going to give them  of his hard earned monies to join them on the new site Im sorry but Im just not having it amp Im convinced its nothing more than a shill account being used to try amp fool others into coughing up their money however theres still a few members who are bravely standing their ground however we all know what happens to them.       If your an ILoveTorrents member amp your sick of their bullshit feel free to tell them what you really think of them in their precious forum thread tell them what you really think of their behaviour amp then screencap your post amp either send it to myself amp I will post it for you or you can post it yourself amp bask in the adulation amp praise which we will duly shower upon you.          If you are a GimmePeers or ILoveTorrents or Ex BitSoup member I urge you to use your common sense amp leave them please dont give those two clowns any more of your hard earned money.         Feel free to tear into this one amp have fun         Easier amp Tidier Post Format       If you intend to post something regarding our favourite three sites just use the name of the site your talking about in this case its obviously ILoveTorrents ,bitsoup,d7oy315,5,t5_3d3ue
