148059,0,t1_ceuo5oy,Rereading what youre saying here something that might be a nice mechanic is armour and weapon maintenance... and if youre unable to get hold of the materials you need to maintain them i.e more orichalcum then youll need to step back to using steel or iron.A way to think about it would be the way arrows are now. If youre an archer in Skyrim you will find very nice arrows that are perhaps a little bit beyond you and you can choose to use them where theyll count. Itd be nice if all of the equipment was that way.Itd mean less of a problem for access to nice stuff early  in one Requiem game I nailed a random Thalmor encounter and got a full set of elven armour at level  or perhaps less. Itd be better if I was able to get it but had to face the choice of using it and losing it or using it and having to pay an arm and a leg to keep it repaired or selling it because I couldnt support it or holding on to it for later.,skyrimrequiem,cevamgu,1,t5_2znbs

505769,0,t3_1zq8kn,Hey! These are the ones I use personally and I can recommendMods Sneak Tools makes any type of stealth activity fun and engaging Binocular Vision I use  It fixes stealth in general. Makes sneaking as close to real life as it can be with this engine Functional Bags uses meshes from the bandoliers mod. You can craft a few bags that you can actually store things inside and wear them ZF Primary needs IMHO better then RND in many aspects and its more compatible because it has a dynamic patcher ala reproccer from SkyRe Dynamic Things makes every container lootable and also allows training your skills with dummies Dynamic Timescale fixes the many timescales of the game inside outside combat etc to be the same. It also has autosave function Dynamic Loot NPCs can drop tempered items rare or epic items and various other items. Very customizable and works really well with Requiem. Also has patches for Immersive armors and weapons Bucklers blocking is essential for almost any type of build. This small mod will give you a fixCompatibility and general idea about your setupDont rely on BOSS. Ever. Dont use Wrye Bash. Ever. If you need a patch for something make it by hand or use an already existing one from the nexus. Wrye will actually do more harm then good believe it or not. Requiems files go to the bottom. Always. Only exceptions are the lighting mods if you use any and any dynamically generated patches ZF Needs for example that are made by a reproccer type of app. Start using TESVedit. You will need it if you want compatibility. Use the MCM and try to tailor the mod to your enjoyment before giving up. You might will give it up. Just saying.,skyrimrequiem,cfxrbsl,1,t5_2znbs

You have a few options. poisoned arrows  health or stamina damage paralysis stagger effects  bull rush wont work youre in Light Armor Fus knockback weaponry magic damage  penetrates blocks. Do you have an elemental weapon or mage follower? resolve your stamina problem  poison resist potion  drink alcohol stamina potions way too rare to rely on generally or stamina enchants range manipulation  dance at the edge of your greatswords range and try and hit him with the tip of your weapon. Be ready for fwd power attacks and block accordingly. This should allow you to get a good block stagger off and finish the foe. environment manipulation  use AI pathing to find yourself somewhere to hide get out your bow and go to town.

Better potions have a higher value and a higher value gives more skill.For enchanting it doesnt matter if you use a grand soul gem or a petty soul gem for enchants. It gives the same amount of skill so dont waste your grands trying to level.Like Andhurati mentioned. I went leather only until jewelry and it worked out well. Save all the gems you find for crafting smithing if you can as they increase the value of the item created by a large margin.

4039334,0,t1_crgowrk,I could never get CCO to work without borking meshes for me more specifically Bandoliers meshes so have not used it but others have no issue.  Would make crafting more interesting and a bit more complex.  There is a Req patch for it.  IJ would make money a bit more plentiful but if you do any significant crafting coin typically isnt an issue.  It adds a ton more types of gems and jewelry crafting is a bit more complex amp realistic.  An ingot gives you like  blanks.  An item may take  blanks so you could get up to  rings from  ingot I believe.  Without gems they are less valuable than vanilla I think.  JoS like I said never used it but from what I recall not engaging in your occupation results in penalties.  No idea of the severity but if you characters focus is crafting this probably wont be an issue.  Your Market Stall would be cool as well.  You can actually set up your own small market space a chair amp a ground blanket and sell your wares to NPCs.  Has its own reputation system so with experience you can get better prices amp more buyers.

4253261,0,t3_39odzh,Ive done some DiD in my time and while Ive had fun with it I feel as though it pulls my game in opposite directions separating my desire to roleplay an interesting character from my desire to survive in DiD.As a longtime hardcore runner of shooters and RPGs DiD has a natural appeal to me but the problem is that in all the other games Ive played hardcore staying alive always takes precendence over playing in character especially in RPGs like BG Dragon Age Diablos POE etc  you play to win in every way possible short of cheating.  Theres a certain wonderful methodical rhythm that you set into where you are constantly trying to minimize your risks and maximize your benefits... but the issue with doing so in Requiem is that the riskreward ratio of playing in a cheesy way and playing straight up are so massively onesided toward the former.  So many enemies will kill you in one shot even bandits with a random lunging power attack that you didnt space properly that if you really want to go for a highlevel character you have to game the hell out of the system  doing a true hardcore run is all about reducing risks as much as possible while continuing to profit.While I find this fun in Req once in awhile it ends up becoming a lot of work farming horkers abusing Alchemy that isnt very fun and then if you do lose your character randomly after spending all your time farming its woefully unsatisfying.All that said everyone should attempt this once or twice  the feeling you get when you lose a character you are attached to is a beautiful albeit painful experience.

If you dont mind I have a couple general questions Looking at some of my questionable mods in TESEdit a couple E.G. Skyrim Sewers and Psychosteves Dragon Priest Masks add armor or weapons but dont have a Leveled ItemNPCSpell entry. The pocket guide implies that such mods are compatible after running the Reqtificator I just want to verify that I understand correctly. For the mods that add locations with vendors E.G. SNOWSky Cities Dawnstar Expanded I looked at the container entries in TESEdit and theyre mostly LItem. This means that the new merchants which draw from the leveled list which is Requiems because the mods themselves dont import their own LItems. Is this interpretation correct? Looking at the compatibility patch DNPC Followers Perk Addon I see that followers wearing heavy armor have the perks AAXarrianGeneralHeavyArmorProtectionFollower PERKB AAXarrianHEavyArmorReductionFollower PERKB PerkSkillBoosts Skill Boosts PERKCF and Juggernaut or . However I was surprised to not find Conditioning Conditioning PERKFD which I thought was necessary from an older reddit thread. I looked at Requiem and found that Juggernautxx perks are named conditioning  Do I understand correctly that the Juggernaut perk replaces Conditioning from an old version of Requiem? I need to make some tweaks to the Inconsequential NPCs Requiem . patch to bring it up to date and Id like to make sure I get it right. On the above note the Followers Perk Addon imports its own Heavy Armor perks which are identical to the ones in Requiem . in TESEdit. Is there any reason to copy the perk rather than using Requiems as a dependency? For Physics Impact Damage Fix the only game setting which conflicts with Requiems is fPhysicsDamageSpeedMin vs. Requiems . My understanding is that in Requiem objects have to move faster to kill you than in PIDF. Overall the intention seems to be the same. Should I assume that Requiem performs the same function as the other mod just with a higher velocity threshold? For mods that implement AI via a quest Smart NPC Water AI is there any possibility of conflict with Requiems AI? I dont know how AI prioritization works.And a pair of questions specifically about your response above I believe Timing Is Everything lets you customize how long quests are delayed which would allow me to set my own thresholds judging by when Im ready. If I use this lower than Requiem in my load order will it break any of Requiems functionality? You mentioned that Requiem has a similar feature as Master of Disguise but the implementation is suboptimal. In the same vein as above would using this mod either higher or lower in my load order break any of Requiems features?Lastly a couple notes for anyone who googles and finds this thread Mage Friendly Dragon Priest Masks is already integrated into Requiem according to what I see in TESEdit.  Theres a patch for Cutting Room Floor at Another Requiem Patch Central. I overlooked this when doing my research. Theres definitely incompatibility between Requiem and Better Wards. Ill see if I can make a compatibility patch in TESEdit and put it up on the Nexus... I really want that fast ward chargeup for reflexbased mage combat.Thank you for your help and patience!,skyrimrequiem,cstftl9,1,t5_2znbs

Unless issues you find out are trivial to fix there will be no support from our side. This kind of support would simply be beyond our limits.

5715949,0,t3_3tajc7,Update Here is the statement of Ogerboss about this Followers are about the only thing still leveled in Requiem.Most followers with a few notable exceptions like Farkas are still leveled in Requiem just like in Vanilla Skyrim they have a level range and then level with the player within that range. However Requiem disables most if not all of the passive bonuses that NPCs acquire for leveling up. So they just receive  attribute points a few skillpoints and in theory a perkpoint. Since it is impossible to add perks to NPCs at runtime they will just end up with  attribute points and the skill points. Since most major character improvements are tied to perks this means that followers will still level with you but they wont gain any significant benefit from it.

5965074,0,t1_cy1d4fy,Thanks for the comment. I recommend to people that they play requiem for a while before watching my videos. The series is basically a How To instruction book. I try to explain all of the mechanics in requiem and how everything works.  When I started doing videos I knew absolutely nothing about any of the technology. I had no background in any of it. It took a while to learn but it was interesting and I did get better over time. It really doesnt require that things are perfect some of the best Lets Play playthroughs i have enjoyed had absolutely terrible video and audio. But the player brought so much love of the game to the series that it was memorable.  Note Most requiem playthroughs are one Oh my god! Hes not ... after another. That is requiem. People have said that I make requiem look too easy and that I should really handicap my character to increase the challenge but I have the advantage of knowing how everything works and how to exploit it.  There are many things you can do in Requiem that I think are game breaking and I dont do those. I should really cover that topic in a video.,skyrimrequiem,cy1jw81,1,t5_2znbs

6176358,0,t1_cyrfffe,Im not sure about Dremora. I had  Conjuration but I only got Atronach summons. But yea you should be able to slaughter them. Also note that Bound Bow  Silver Arrows would probably wreck them need archery though.You dont NEED destro  resto to be viable late game. If you dont take any of those you need enchanting at least though. My pure archer with smithingenchanting is dealing with anything. Already completed main quest DB got Konahrik mask. But I agree if not smithinigenchanting then destro  restro.Well but thats about the only thing you wont kill with pure Conjuration  Dragon Priests. Everything else should be easily killed. Also you can tackle hard content much earlier.. I recently killed Centurion with Ghostly Hound.. after clearing all the falmers. It wasnt easy but its possible. And theres no way of doing it with  destruction I think due to no meatshield and mana requirements.By the way... the longer you fight with those naggers the more difficult they get. Or bugged. My almostgodlike character couldnt kill one in Labirynthian because I think he buffed himself with mage armor like  times. Basically best bow possible in Requiem with silver arrows did almost zero damage. I reloaded the save before the encounter he got downed pretty fast and it was bug since those three priests just before Morokei got wrecked. So especially if you dont start the fight asap and priest seem to take no damage try reloading.,skyrimrequiem,cyrorz9,1,t5_2znbs

My problem is my char is a jackofalltrades which is penalized in Requiem so by now Im not OP at all.That said I use to mop the floor with notbosses enemies  dest  alt something around  or  H and  or so evasion. The key points here for me are Dawnbreaker its just awesome against anything. Fireshock spell. I still need to invest three perk points in dest to cap its damage but one or two casts kill almost any regular enemy. Firebreath. I only have  words of this shout but it mops the floor against trolls any kind snow elves forsworn dreugs vampires etc... Alchemy . I only invested the first  or  perk points there but even so its awesome. I have potions that restore more than  mana for  seconds and the same with health without using daedras heart  resist frostfireshock for s etc... And I make really good potions too. Magnus staff. This staff just rocks period. Against dragons you must play with the enviroment one bite and Im dead but fireshock or the frost equivalent combined with this staff and I have yet to find a dragon I cant kill... Although I have yet to fight Alduin of course.If I had focused on magic by now I think Id be really OP master dest spells are just TOO much but since I neither have mage enchantments nor I have maxed the perks I cant cast most of them unless Im up to my neck in ably potions.Right now I finished Dark Brotherhood Thieves Guild Companions amp Mages questlines and Im just one or two steps to finish both main questline trapping a dragon in Dragonsreach now and about to confront Hackon in DG questline and honestly Im not sure to hold all the winning cards.,skyrimrequiem,cz2kyjo,1,t5_2znbs

6325597,0,t3_428qcv,It really depends more on your individual skillperk levels and what gear youve acquired. The concept of character level is not that meaningful in Requiem. A level  barbarian with the right perks and Volundrung Saviors Hide and maybe a couple other choice items can probably dominate everything in the game. But spread those perks just a little differently and replace those daedric artifacts with slightly less OP gear and it might take the same character until level  before they can dominate everything.

6394200,0,t3_4393t4,So all of this needs to be filtered through the fact that I havent played in a while Ive been in school. So there are some mods that I simply do not know. Ill let you know what information I dont currently have and try and get to you in the next few days. I used Skyrim Coin Replacer Redux but you should be aware that it is not compatible with Requiem without a patch. I used Aziroks patch with Requiem . and had no problems it was a pretty minimal patch to begin with. So make sure you get that or you wont get the proper SCRR experience.  As for its compatibility with Morrowloot I built it with use with SCRR in mind but xEdit is loading it now just so I can be sure... Okay there is one very minor conflict between RequiemMorrowloot and RequiemSCRR. I would recommend that you load RequiemMorrowloot last. Not because it is mine but RequiemSCRR seems to be readding a couple items that Requiem had removed. All in all Id say that is compatible. RequiemScarcity is perfect compatibility since Scarcity does not touch coins. I always use Campfire and Frostfall. Just doublechecked in xEdit they are fine. Morrowloot doesnt change the weather. So CoT and AoS which I also always use should be fine. I use and recommend the ScarcityxLoot module. I have heard complaints about the Merchant modules but if you simply dont use the Merchant modules then there will be no changes to Merchants in your game. Falskaar is a tricky one. It doesnt really change the mainland so there will be no direct incompatibility however there will be inconsistency. When you are at Falskaar youll likely be using custom leveled lists specifically for the mod rather than it leaning on mainland lists so you will find items there that normally Morrowloot would filter out. I will look into this more when I look up other mods I am not familiar with. Dual Sheath Redux I havent used this but doesnt it have a skyproc? Ill look into this one as well.Okay so Falskaar and Dual Sheath Redux will require some research. And Ill keep your modlist saved in Chrome. Unfortunately I have to go run some errands now or I wont have time before class this afternoon. I hope this helps some already and that youll feel comfortable asking me any follow up questions while Im doing the additional research.P.S. I know you asked other people about Loot and Degradation but I thought I would explain why I specifically recommend it for Morrowloot. Since you are going to be finding less variety in weaponry since it restricts the nonnordic armors to their most logical locations then having Loot and Degradation means that you will at least find a variety of quality among the weapons you DO find. Also more broadly since Requiem works with it to provide tempered armor in its own way the Degradation features complement that.,skyrimrequiem,czggd6d,2,t5_2znbs
6413251,0,t3_43j50o,Try using a save cleaner and remove any orphans script. Another thing I would suggest is if youre using an enb while elfx is being used I believe it might be caused by graphics overloading I would check that out. I have the same problem like you except its the opposite.. whenever I load a save itll crash..... from the main menu that is. This never happened to me before I used Realvision.

6417466,0,t1_czj2rn8, I dont use quicksaves I always either create new saves or overwrite old ones through the menu. I am aware of the discussions about quicksaves vs manual saves though I have no opinion on the matter. I try to err on the side of caution however.     I dont think I acuired any new magic effect between saves I enchanted my bow with shock damage though and took the archery perk for better damage against armored enemies if I remember correctly. I dont even have to fight to CTD though if I just stand there in god mode and dont fight back the game crashes anyway. XPMSE and FNIS are animation related but you also need them for certain custom bodies HDT physics or different weapon placement and scaling. I havent used custom bodies HDT physics or different weapon placement in this game though. Weapon scaling is part of XPMSEs esp though. I did try to remove XPMSE and rebuild Requiem for the indifferent earlier as described in the OP the same exact crashes occur.I hope the problems are only part of this specific that savegame thanks again. ,skyrimrequiem,czj3nh4,1,t5_2znbs

I noticed that my computer became much lower as soon as installing ENB performance boost even without graphics enhancement.  I did a lot of tweakings for the ini files but it got worse and worse.  After getting rid of that my machine runs much better.  ENB makes the overall graphics more dreamlike but I am not missing it.  There are some mods that come close to the effect of ENB.  eNB is piece of crap that makes my other games unstable tooAs for conflicting mods I basically minimize mods that require plugins and opt for direct replacement mods.  Right now I only install mods that have a patch for requiem.  So I dont have things like RND and iNeed because there is no patch for them.  Also if a mod has a patch for requiem it does not necessarily means it is fully compatible and bug free.  There could still be bugs and glitches that are overlooked by the modders.  When you run a bunch of mods that bloat up your total list of plugins you increase the chance of your game becoming unstable.  Right now I have a stable installation with  some mods.  Most of them are graphical enhancements.  My actual game only has less than  plugins in addition to requiem nonofficial patches and DLCs.  Its pretty stable.  ,skyrimrequiem,czjga9g,2,t5_2znbs

6448100,0,t1_czm996n,Pretty much this.  Im getting used to Attack Commitment... after racking up quite the bounty in various holds because of all the damn interlopers jumping into my battles and stepping in front of my unturnable swings.  It makes attacking a target in a group a very tricky maneuver.  I think it fits very well in Req.  It makes combat both easier and harder.  I do have Combat Behavior Improved as well.  I just need to stop those swings that are going to hit a friendly or miss big by throwing up an emergency block!  TK Dodge  will not use.  Requiem has its own dodge system in the appropriate skill tree.  As uAshevajak said it would be too gamey in Requiem.  You can still avoid a good number of attacks while in Heavy armor if you keep an eye on range even more so with the Attack Commitment mod.  Getting a free dodge ability regardless of gear is just munchkining too OP.  The Dodge ability in Evasion requires  perks and has significant gear restrictions.  Its balanced.  ,skyrimrequiem,czm9uzi,2,t5_2znbs

6532246,0,t1_czuye1p,Supposedly it doesnt matter.  It is supposed to scan the current game settings.  gt ...but it actually takes me out of the roleplaying experience when I feel the need to grind skills...My point exactly   I dont play RP adventures games to sit in front of a menu punching buttons.  And I often do not do much crafting in any form anyway except maybe my Nord Warriors as that just seems fitting to craftmaintain your gear in that culture I use Honed Metal for most of my other warriors.  Only the crafting skills really require grinding as they will never level if you dont well maybe some of the larcenous skills as well... .  But the rest of the skill will level organically as you play.  If smithing for example leveled as you needed it there would be no real reason to grind.  Sans mods you can generally find better gear than you can craft for quite a while.  I find Steel Plate Orcish Elven Scale etc long before I can craft it.  So Smithing is next to useless to outfit yourself until when?  Late midgame?  ... unless you sit and mindlessly grind like a monkey pushing buttons.  Nah.  Not me.  Id rather be laying siege to a bandit fort   And maintaining weapons Loot amp Degradation will never yield enough XP to keep smithing paced.  And dont get me started on Alchemy.  Its even worse than Smithing.  Running around slaying benign Giants for their toes?  Pretty dark if you ask me.  Oh lets go spend a night slaying Horkers for their fat!  I need to make a bunch of Frenzy potions to dump on a sucker merchant.  Yay!  Im a hero!  Hehe.  Lame.  Anyway give SkyTweak a shot and play around with leveling rates until you find a good balance.  I had started out at like x but that was just too cheaty.  Ive found the x Alch amp x Smithing a good balance for the little crafting I do.  You still have to grind somewhat a fair amount BUT dont approach crafting the same way you would without SkyTweak else youll end up leveling it too fast!

7009213,0,t1_d1afeud,It all depends on situation. For example my h warrior could take out  giants in Sleeping Tree camp  that is in very tight interior. Mage would stand no chance as his only way would be to oneshot them basically. h  timed stuns made the trick it wasnt easy though.Also as previous poster mentioned  smithing. Bigger weapons get better scaling so you can for example get daedric bowh to legendary while dagger will remain exquisite or something. If you could get ebony h to  dmg I cant even imagine Daedric  note that Daedric has highest scaling of all materials  so it will always remain the best. Also white phial can give you double damage for  seconds so were looking at  dmg per hit for  seconds. Insane.I guess it all comes down to armor but tempering armor is really good. Heavy armor with around  armor will make you almost impervious to physical damage. You can just stand while multiple dwarven spheresbandits are attacking you and you take almost no damage. But yes youre right. Its just different playstyle. I think mages will be always more powerful at the same level but then  you can invest in enchanting get some magic resist or go blocking with spellbreaker.. then mages cant do shit and they will get oneshotted by your sprinting power attack with legendary poisoned and enchanted daedric waraxe even if they have every buff possible on themselves D,skyrimrequiem,d1au9em,1,t5_2znbs

Getting to  can be very fast if you use a trainer. The moment you get to  though you get all of the scrolls and spells and these are very expensive and you get an infinite pile of armor an infinite pile of alchemy ingredients an infinite pile of soul gems and infinite gold. You dont have to work for anything. As a result alchemy smithing and enchanting just went to  without any effort. And anything you want to buy is basically free because you have infinite gold. I had alchemy smithing and enchanting at  before I got lockpicking to  and I still though it was a terrible mechanic. I also had about  gold and I still thought the free gold was a terrible idea. Just for the heck of it I took my gold to over  million just to show what is possible. You can see my character in the video series. My character had  in every magic tree except destruction. So I instantly had every spell in every magic tree. I also had an infinite number of scrolls of every type.I have talked with people who used a follower to open merchant chests at an early level and they all said that doing that is a really bad idea.

Reqtificator seems to think the bugsmasher is above requiem  check your ini file directly to see what the order actually is. NMM and the Reqtificator seem to disagree on the order of those last three mods. My bet would be on NMMs UI not displaying the order correctly since I had lots of similar issues with the plugins tab when I used NMM. cough MO cough.I also got the same error as you on my last setup but for a different reason  theres a generic missing masters error that goes off when in actual fact the issue was that the mods dependencies were ordered differently in my list to what it expects i had dawnguard before hearthfires or viceversa or something.Wrye Bash is really good for resolving these kinds of issues. Install and load up Wrye Bash select Bugsmasher in the list and then in the panel on the right at the bottom it will highlight the problem in red. MO has a nice way of integrating Wrye Bash and the Reqtificator cough If you were to do that it would probably show that the mods are ordered wrongly in the ini file as reported by the Reqtificator despite what NMMs buggyass plugins list says.Good luck! ,skyrimrequiem,d1pa177,2,t5_2znbs

As others have mentioned some kind of alternate start mod is my suggestion.  I dont do playthroughs as I seldom play through.  I just play a character and allow that character to go where shehe feels.  A majority of the time there IS no main quest.  Several have never seem the right side of the map or gone east as far as Rorikstead or Whiterun.  Starting a character and not having the MQ shoving you along is a sigh of relief.  With Alt StartLAL you dont kick off the MQ until you get close to Helgen.  With Skyrim Unbound you can completely disable the MQ until... heh I forget how to kick it off.  I use Unbound when I pretty much have little care for the MQ so Im not even sure how to start it.  Anyway with either of these you can focus on establishing your character in the world and then get along onto the MQ when you are or your character is ready for it.  Now if you have already begun the game...?   Well one suggestion might be to go visit a close relative in Solitude or Markarth before you start the MQ.  And no thats not a joke.  Id think most people undergoing a dangerous endeavor would maybe take some time to visit one last time? anyone close to them.   One experience with a character was a rogue who started off in the rift.  Joined the Thieves Guild and took a mission at level  to rob someone in Solitude of a shiny bauble dont recall what it was.  Anyway it took me an ingame week to make the trek she walked no wagon travel and she was level  when she got back.  That was  side quest for Vex or Delvin or whatever.   Now part of the reason it took so long was I was using an injury mod and got into a couple fights that left her unable to travel.  That obviously helps when you have to hunker down for the rest of a day or  to heal up but if you are literally walking and you ensure the time scale isnt set too high I use  myself then a trip cross country really could be an adventure in and of itself!  Especially if you use any creature mods that help fill all that empty space in the world.  So anyway thats my advice.  Go visit your parents or aunt amp uncle or whoever in a distant part of the map and make the journey to tell them Dragons are now in the world and the Jarl asked me to do something very dangerous.  I may never see you again!  Oh and please water my garden and take care of Fluffy for me while Im gone!  And it is very possible that despite the urgency of the MQ you may be armtwisted into helping out some others on your journey.  ,skyrimrequiem,d27e1re,1,t5_2znbs

7646553,0,t3_4jzyqy,Wait so by drawing boud bow you dont lose stamina at all? That shouldve been the case right? Going to test it right away.. It weights  so would make sense..Also about smithing. It gets so insane at later levels that I dont thin you could even compare to bound bow. I remember that at mid level Bound was better than orcish lets say.. but once you get to Daedric and Dragonbone they have tempering scaling of  which is highest in the game. With Legendary Smithing numbers just skyrocket. Now I have my Dragonbone Bow tempered and it does  damage. I seriously doubt that bound bow could ever come close to that. As its nice utility Id still choose normal bow against undeads  to be able to one shot draugr and deal with Dragon Priests.Still if it really cost no stamina to use its a great choice for lesser stuff or farming gems.. or dealing with situations you dont absolutely need to kill super fast DP. If so I tried recently getting it fast.. and its totally possible. Being bosmer getting  level ups in magicka and having a mage stone you could cast it even without a single perk in conjuration. It costs about  mana. The only problem is killing those two mages which involves orcish bow and some good arrows but doble ,skyrimrequiem,d3bddz4,1,t5_2znbs

The answer is that the mace and many other weapons will need a fire enchant or something. I suggest you at least give war axes a look. They are bladed and so can do well against undead.

Youre acting like Requiem isnt its own distinct thing but it very much is. People dont play Requiem because they like that one thing it changes about one quest or because it gives Ulfric cool armor they play Requiem because it offers its own engaging and unique experience. And hes right its hard to gauge exactly how certain mods play with Requiems balance because Requiem is a departure from the normal Skyrim modding experience its changes to Skyrim are very expansive. What hes saying is that people in the community who are experienced Requiem players and maybe mod makers themselves who understand the nuances of Requiem should work together to compile mods that add to it without sacrificing its native balancing and design.

8530144,0,t1_d67tnue,Its not depending on your weapon of choice. Two handers get a nice damage so you dont have to smith or enchant. You could use alchemy for the bow to kill dragons and silver arrows for undead. Its just you wont kill any Dragon Priests like that nor Alduin immune to poison. You could go only with enchanting since stronger enchants will make sure you can beat Dragon Priests and Alduin and automatons with a bow. A good twohander shouldnt need enchanting or smithing even though it would be boosted immensely.So obligatory if you want to do endgame yea. You wont kill the World Eater with your unenchanted and untempered bow and without any magic and thats only fair.Id say that swoard and board will have biggest problems without enchanting smithing doesnt give much since scaling of one handed isnt that great.

8881146,0,t1_d7ew5ho,Actually I think you get it. We all struggle with finding balance in skyrim and that is the main reason that there are so many skyrim mods on nexus. You either have to restrict your character or install mods to balance the game. Requiem doesnt fix skyrim it just makes it the game bethesda should have made in the first place. You can still break requiem. For example for lore reasons daedric quest items are very powerful. If you go straight to all of the daedric quests it will absolutely break your game. It is much harder to do the daedric quests in requiem but you can still muddle through them in mid game. So most of us dont do that or we dont use deadric quest items.   I think most players skip most of the daedric quests and even then avoid most of the quest items.After you play requiem for a while you will still want to install some mods to achieve the game that you want to play. You will just be starting with a much better foundation than vanilla skyrim and you will need a lot fewer mods than you did in previous games.It think most people think that destruction is OP but I have never played a destruction mage I find destruction boring. High level Conjuration is also very powerful. But you can certainly be killed as a level  mage. But at level  destruction which is going to take a very long time to reach you are ready for the three end game quests. The three end game quests are designed to be a challenge for a very high level character. Once those quests are done t is usually time to start another game. It has taken me as long as  hours to complete one game. A normal game for me is completed in about  hours. That is plenty of time with one build.No matter how strong you get there are things in requiem that will onehit you. Just about the time you think you are OP something usually kills you. There are rooms full of very nasty things and most people come close to rage quitting in their first game because of some of these unexpected encounters. And there are encounters that are particularly nasty for pure mages. I have found that most surprises in requiem are very bad and there are a lot of them. But that is something I have always loved about requiem. You just never know what is going to happen next and you play the entire game on the edge of your seat. ,skyrimrequiem,d7fdzv9,3,t5_2znbs

9391683,0,t3_5982r6,If you want to play an orc heavy armorTwo handed with pure hp investment and the ebony blade is an exceptional dragon killing build. I personally used it on my Nord and was absolutely wrecking dragons. They deal a lot of damage because they have naturally really high armor penetration but they wont kill you in one hit. With enough lifesteal you can just hit them up close and not die so long as you have some potions or armor of fireice resistance. You can also stagger them by bashing them in the middle of their attacks giving you basically free hits. You will want the become ethereal shout if only because it will allow you to dodge the drainvitality shouts but other than that it is a breeze. You can get a bow to apply some decay poison while they are flying but you should be easily able to just knock it below half the first or second time you get up close. You truly dont need much armor penetration. Just the  from the greatsword perks and a decently high twohanded is enough to kill dragons easily.Other skills? Nothing else is strictly necessary but you could take Alchemy for potions of resist firefrost and healing. Enchantingsmithing for obvious reasons. Archery for those pesky long range encounters maybe quickly becomes irrelevant my dragonslayer has a  archery and  HA Twohanded and never uses a bow anymore. Thats really about all you need for a warrior. If you really want to go sword and board its going to be more tricky. You need more stamina investment to maintain your damage output thus costing you valuable levels in health. You also dont have as much raw dps as with a twohander. You do however have shield which depending on the shield you get can be amazing. I highly recommend spellbreaker because the ward is invaluable against dragons but RPing that item in particular is frustrating. Anything that gives you elemental resistance is worthwhile though. This build sucks for fighting dragons up close because they will twoshot you if you fail your block timing even a little and it isnt as good for staggering compared to twohanded bashing. The stamina consumption is also rather high with this build which can be annoying to manage. Light armor sucks against dragons. No other way to put it. They hit you too often and too hard to make the armor worthwhile. You might as well fight naked if you use evasion as the armor pen will go through anything other than tempered dragonscale. If you decide to go evasion dont bother with melee or use mage armor and transmute muscles to avoid straight death. ,skyrimrequiem,d96gntb,2,t5_2znbs

9593890,0,t3_5bxv91,I would suggest the Harbinger Armor mod if you are in the Companions. Very lore friendly and fits in well with Requiem. designed for Requiemedit just realised that you are in robes so not sure anymore. Typically folks in robes use mage armor. ,skyrimrequiem,d9vn66z,1,t5_2znbs
9609097,0,t1_d9x0i3n,gt but afterwards those low level skillups wont give you quick levelups meaning you will have the same perks for dozens of hoursThat may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view. Personally I dont mind slow progress or having to wait to be able to get the perks I want. My current character is sitting on three perk points that he will take when alteration hits the next level where several perks become available. But its taking a while for this character to level alteration given his currently limited spell book. Thats fine with me though since I enjoy the dlo progress and dont mind waiting for the character to be ready to get stronger. ,skyrimrequiem,d9xin2j,1,t5_2znbs

9670771,0,t3_5dim01,Well it depends the best way would be to make a patch like Turija suggested.The quick and dirty way is just making a direct edit ofc the downside to doing this is if you reinstall or update the mod you edit you will have to redo your edit. Do not make direct edits to Requiem For the Indifferent as anytime you rebuild it you will lose your edits.For Armor of Yngol simply look up the stats for Dragonplate or Dragonscale cant tell if it is heavy or light and change each pieces DNAMArmor rating to match Requiem base rating for those sets then rerun the Skyproc and bam done.For changing the Blades armor under BODTTemplate change armor type from heavy to light and then under keywords change armorheavy to armorlight. Doing this does means if you ever want blades armor to be Heavy armor again you will have to edit back to original. Blades armor is inbetween Dwarven and Steel plateorcish so not very good. ,skyrimrequiem,da54irt,1,t5_2znbs

9750278,0,t1_daelvhc,Thats nice.  seems pretty nice. As I said in my other post best way would be to nerf physical avaiability of those in the world but thats a huge work. Thistle gives almost always  ingredient per harvest and yet you can get quite a few of them.gt Something to keep in mind when picking ingredients is that each unit you have may be quite a few of whatever youre taking to make it strong enough to be in a potion.True but for example garlic when we can see physically  IMO it shouldnt be  bulb harvested from  visible bulbs or so. One whole bulb should be surely enough to make a potion.Anyway good change. I kinda hated running around with hundreds of flowers. Now that I think of it since its getting worked on by alchemy station it wouldve been cool if you had normal Requiem yield but crafting a potion would require not single but maybe like  mountain flowers and other ingredients?

But unlike Relighting Skyrim RLO does not aim to fix the problems of vanilla Skyrim lighting.Requiem  Realistic Darkness by Axonis is not just based on RLO it is is a blend of edits from Realistic Lighting Overhaul Realistic Nights and optionally from the Skyrim Particle Patch but this isnt a simple merge of mods.,skyrimrequiem,deau34d,1,t5_2znbs
10990192,0,t1_dedot09,Unfortunately the arrow blocking mechanic is built into the game. Its an already preset entry point. And I cant create my own entry points. Idk maybe I can try to find what detects something hitting the shield,skyrimrequiem,dedpc4o,1,t5_2znbs
10991345,0,t3_5wxzk3,I like the way bows are right now its really XBows I have a problem with though there are no end game light  bows. However while there are both light and heavy XBows light XBows suck right now unless your using them for RP.The largest game play difference in bow vs XBow is when you lose maneuverability and when you lose stamina.  XBows work best when you make  shot then drop them. So going Heavy XBow to light bow is better than Heavy bow to light bow.  IMO I would exaggerate the effect.  Make Heavy XBows take  seconds to reload but do x their current damage for both the weapon and bolts but you can just drop them and swap to something else.  The problem is they start out equipped when you draw them and I dont think there is a way to change that behavior easily however there are a lot of cheese out there and thats ok in a single player game.   Reload speed seems the way to fix light bows and light xbows.  However if you cut light Xbow damage but dramatically increase reload speed then they still dont fit run and gun style as you get stuck after shooting.  So IMO keep slow reload and reduce damage but dont reduce runspeed at all.  This makes them not the ultimate run and gun bows instead they are the ultimate poison delivery system.  AKA mechanical blow guns.After that its just light bows. The that  perk for faster reloads and the  perk for lower stamina use makes light bows less meaningful.  Further has heavy Dadric bows  shot just about anything with archery enchants the more or less own end game.  Going in another direction I like the idea of increasing enchant effectiveness on light bows.  Continuing the idea the  XBow perk should be more damage or AP not faster reload.  x damage might be game breaking but heavy bows get so good you need a lot to make XBows useful without heavily nerfing bows significantly.  Not to mention the XBow gt H stops being a thing when h becomes godlike engines of destruction only competing with destruction mages for pure sustained DPS and having no peers in burst DPS.PS The other option might be to increase Heavy XBow sneak attack multiplier and make light XBows silent but that does not really fit the HA knight play stile.,skyrimrequiem,dedu1f5,1,t5_2znbs

11018498,0,t1_degvy9a,Marksman does indeed have a lot of perks. thats because why should one be a master of  different ranged weapons? thus i seperated them. each branch is for a different weapon. with  perks total. i will arrange the perks so that if one wanted to only have marksman as a secondary weapon they can invest like  perks and have it viable. all of the trees will have this ideology. yes it will take a lot of perks to master a skill but thats how it should be. also another thing is that around lvl  you wont have very many high skills. so a lot of the perks will still be locked. so at lvl  you may have  marksman which unlocks  crossbow perks ,skyrimrequiem,degwzo7,1,t5_2znbs

Theres no way a mage should be as tanky as a battlemages. I want to make all  defenses very unique. Heavy armor is all about being able to take hits and stand your ground.

11209637,0,t3_5z3v9f,After have given it a break and have been playing ESO for several months now Ultronos for any who want to add me D I felt the need to come back.I intend to do the main quest and so I rolled an Imperial since them and Nords make the most sense to be a dragonborn. Anyway he was a regular dude from Cyrodiil. Had an average life and just a slight bit of training with a sword. He had a weird Uncle who was a wizard and he taught him a few destruct spells but was relatively uninterested especially since his parents didnt particularly care for magic. Speaking of parents they were adventures. They never got into anything too crazy but they had plenty stories to tell. The main story that affected their life was when they visited Skyrim. Crypts always make for good stories. It was here that they made friends with people just like them other adventures. Long story short the  spent years traveling and exploring together. However they were both couples and cared more for each other than they did adventuring. Those Nords became our heroes godparents. Our hero fell in love with with the beauty of Skyrim and decided to move there when he was of age. He was enraptured by his parents takes of adventuring but was never inclined to go after it.Fast forward to a few years. Our hero has moved to Whiterun. Hes bought the cozy breezehome and is ready to start his new life. Hes gone to the Jarls steward to see of any official work he could do and all he received was a bounty letter. Timid but needing money our hero figured he could try it out. He was sure he could remember a thing or two his Uncle taught him and his trainer. Gathering the last of his money he gears up and heads out.After barely surviving and conquering an entire bandit camp single handedly hes felt the adrenaline. Theres no going back.He later decided to join the Companions. What easier way to get adventure than those hired to do it especially when its practically in his yard. He gets sent to take care of an animal problem in Riverwood. After doing so he remembers his god parents and where they lived...Helgen. He realized it was near by and decided to go drop by for a surprise!You can guess what happens next.,skyrimrequiem,df2llhb,1,t5_2znbs

11512043,0,t1_dg0n4l7,I have done the  armor test against giants and the answer in my case was yes I did get killed a lot. I also found out that my bashing timing is terrible. As a result I learned how to block and power bash instead.I like to fight some enemies over and over again to see how they react to different tactics and weapons. I have fought the  dremora outside the shrine dozens of times and with all kinds of weapons. First it is fun and second every time I fight them I get better at killing them. To just fight them once because you only play DiD is to cut off the fun. Before I started my h game I must have cleared embershard  times to learn how h works in combat. I tested heavy and evasion armor and found out I was better in heavy. I also found out how important it is to have kill moves turned off.I think by not playing around in requiem you miss out on both learning and fun. I have a lot more fun fighting the tower of bandits all day long on a Saturday than I do racing through a questline. In some of my most fun and memorable games my pc didnt start any questlines or join any guilds. I just explored skyrim and ran around an killed things.No matter how much I know about this game nothing in requiem is certain. One bad decision or one small miscalculation and your character is dead.

In the west they fight better and are stronger XDIf you can move really fast for example you wouldnt need to dodge  feet away from an attack youd just dodge it by  inch and counter attack as fast as possible. Its be more like a slow time than jump  feet away because its cool.I guess it has to do with perspective aswell... Final fantasy is a rd person experience.In st person instead of attacking really fast youd basically fight in slow motion.

11733776,0,t3_67denu,Blur is your goto arrow protection spell. You will probably need to invest in a couple illusion perks to use it effectively. There are also multiple levels of spells so mage armor  is terrible but mage armor  is pretty good combined with transmute muscles and you are incredibly strong. On the other hand you will burn through mana potions like crazy with a build like that. The best way to not get killed by arrows is to not get hit which means use blur and train your light armor skill. ,skyrimrequiem,dgq1xk5,1,t5_2znbs

11750291,0,t1_dgrux5e,That happens because Requiem is loaded before KFRs patch.  You can fix this by simply editing KFR patch via TesVedit.  KFR patch currently sets the axe of white run like weaponsnordheronordherobattleaxe.nif .  You may change it as WeaponsExecutionerExecutionerAxe.nif if you want your axe looking like headmens axe OR WeaponsRuefulAxeRuefulAxe.nifdefault.This is step by step process.. Install Teseditits not heavy as cktool easy of use too. launch Tesedit. Find Any rueful axe from any esmespor default skyrim too  In the case of The rueful axe you can search it by formID ce. There will be  mod information all about Rueful axe there.  The one placed in right end is usually Requiem for indifferent.esp DO NOT EDIT this value its meaningless to edit the .esp because of reqtificator.  Instead one in the left of it is usually final mod conflict winner.which is likely to be KFRs patch in this case. Look for the line MODEL in right side of screen.Below FULL NAME. Edit the model directory by copyamppaste Or simply drag the model information from the mod you want.. Scroll down and Look for WNAM Section. Youll find something like stPersonRuefulAxe STATADD you have to change it into the value you wish.  . Once all is done Quit Tesedit and it will ask you if you wish to save the changes with showing modified mods.  click OK.OR you can make your own ESP file to keep the changes.

But this type of issue is probably easier to fix in xEdit than the CK because you can look at the records in the patch and see exactly what changes the patch makes to Icatos and revert them to vanilla Apocalypse. It might be as easy as removing the records that change the spell from the patch. I havent installed the new version yet so I cant be more helpful since I dont know what exactly was done to it in the latest patch but Id start by examining the changes to the spell the spell effect and the spell tome including leveled lists that reference it to see what the latest requiem patch does and then remove any changes other than changes to the mans cost and cost of the spell tome that were made by the old patch. ,skyrimrequiem,dgxsc54,1,t5_2znbs
