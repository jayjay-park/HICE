5357824,0,t3_3oe0ij,Something is sketchy with this tournament for sure.  I was hanging around the bottom of dominator and the top of predator. Now Im in the  spot in dominator and over  away from th spot.  I was in the  spot earlier today. So much work for such a shit reward. ,JurassicWorldApp,cvwits1,3,t5_38txc
5595763,0,t3_3rrizs,You just get stuck at level  and the XP means nothing.  The same thing happened at level  and level  before the updates.  The missions at this stage are crap and mainly just have you accumulated coins or food.  Several repeats.  I dont think its worth saving missions. ,JurassicWorldApp,cwqpgr8,1,t5_38txc

6359974,0,t3_42ovve,Never sell any dinosaurs. Im Level  and luckily saw this advice on here as youll need X amount of Dino type in later missions and all those commons rares and super rares you have accumulated will come in handy.,JurassicWorldApp,czck3oc,3,t5_38txc
6474174,0,t3_449fk3,Dont sell legendaries at least until you have a level  and is no hybrid material while the game goes you just start stocking them I have  ostra and havent ever bought a single one  more and I will have a free level .Your level is high aswell so I dont think you really need the dna that bad,JurassicWorldApp,czoz4se,2,t5_38txc

6959716,0,t1_d14k2cf,I try to keep commons if I can get a hybrid out of them cheaper than buying the damn things I figure. Otherwise I keep a single Level  Common for the collection and just sell the excess. Ill probably do the same for rares as I get farther into the game.,JurassicWorldApp,d157vvl,1,t5_38txc

7315606,0,t3_4f7mur,One player had a suggestion to prebuild some buildings so they will be ready when a mission came up.Thats fine and it does work but I found I needed ridiculous numbers of them like  maintenance facilities or  mazes or  communication stations.  It was always more than I had prebuilt which meant I had to wait the whole time anyway.,JurassicWorldApp,d29qgrn,1,t5_38txc

7662837,0,t1_d3d611n,Bruh I got my random legendary pack from a live arena battle and didnt even notice until I saw a Prionosuchus come out of it. And guess what I got pretty close to the top prize pack on the dominator wheel but of course Im getting the food and coins next to it or else that pack wouldnt be seen at all.

7726817,0,t3_4l5fpm,Guys he said nonmystery pBut yeah youre just unlucky. I had a streak of bad luck with packs better than Common ones around the same number of packs you had.

7922441,0,t3_4ns1yn,Having completed all the missions there is literally nothing in this game that I find exciting anymore. The tournaments are extremely rare and they last way too long. The BSI is  mystery and common packs and  raresuper rare. The weekly events only ever give super rares. Aquatic creatures are a waste of DNA and are ultimately worthless. I wouldnt say I have high hopes for the new raid mode or hybrids but any new content would be better than what we have right now.,JurassicWorldApp,d46k2oa,3,t5_38txc

8530152,0,t1_d67tct6,I finished having all legendary normal dinos at level  finally the other day and now i m focusing on the last few SRRares. After that i might work on some aquatics. I have never felt the need to upgrade them. MoTD is very easy with all at level .I hope they do not release an aquatic tournament. I dislike aquatics and the variety is not so great it would need so much resources i guess...But in any case for such stuff i saved k DNA myself. Just need to wait now...,JurassicWorldApp,d67tzu0,1,t5_38txc
