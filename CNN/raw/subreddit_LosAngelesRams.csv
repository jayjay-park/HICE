But Peacock spending the extra money before he had it contributed to the Leagues decision that the St. Louis plan wasnt actually viable.

I think Fisher has the potential to coach a Super Bowl contending team again but the team HAS to have at least better than Alex Smith type of player at the QB position IMO. I do agree with you when you say that its not always his ultimate decision with personnel. It is however  his decision when it comes to onfield decisions. With Todd Gurley and our defense coming back with Quinn Tree McDonald and everyone else that was injured I do think we have a playoff caliber team with much better play from the QB position. I also agree with you when you say that we need more depth instead of Andrew Luck but we have to capitalize with a stellar D now and cant wait much longer on finding a franchise QB.

6644769,0,t1_d0694ta,gt Im still sad to see him goYeah same here.  Laurinaitis and Long were longtime members of the Rams family and its sad to see them go.  On the other hand both were overpaid for years so maybe well all be happy about this in the long run.Anyone think either guy resigns at a lower price?  I think we have solid replacements for both of them but every team has to deal with injuries and theyd both provide excellent depth at the right price.  And Longs positive influence on the team went way beyond his production on the field so someone like Greg Hardy may get more sacks but I think a healthy Long might just be a better piece of the puzzle.  Every weekend during the season Ill be watching games and think to myself ExRam as someone like Amendola makes a play.  Seeing Long and Laurinaitis in another uniform if thats how it all works out is going to really suck.As for Cook Im not sorry to see him go.

6884098,0,t3_4a1h95,McLeod is a very well rounded safety he kind of does everything well. We played him very very deep and his responsibility most times was to cover for everyone else be the Angel. A role he was very good at. His best attributes are probably his ability to fly to the ball his football IQ as hes very very quick at diagnosing plays and his tackling. Hes a very very sound tackler and he loves to come up hit and hit hard. His coverage ability is great too hes usually blanketing guys who come into his area and doesnt usually get beat deep. Weaknesses...size is a big thing. Hes not a big guy and most of the time this isnt a problem because he makes up for it everywhere else but in jump ball situations he can be beat easily by bigger plays so watch out for him against guys like Dez Bryant. Id also say since he is such an aggressive player he can occasionally bite on plays and thatll lead to big gains by the other team. Hes usually sound in this area but its happened a few times. He was a captain for special teams specifically but Id say he developed into a leader on defense as well. More of a lead by example type guy hes not too talkative or anything but he does his job and works hard as hell. Very competitive guy. Yeah he does help guys get set and everything like that. Hes a very very intelligent guy to come in as an UDFA and then make such an impression that hes already given the freedom to make adjustments and checks and help guys get set in only his nd year its very impressive. Hes a guy you can tell watches a lot of film and formations because even though he plays very deep youll see him recognize things because he comes up running to stop things like screens or outside run plays behind the LOS all the time. ,LosAngelesRams,d0wmndc,12,t5_2rgnd

7258730,0,t1_d239108,You are right that people overplay his footwork my biggest issue is his inability to dance in the pocket. He clearly understands what needs to be done with his footwork its just incredibly inconsistent which is why his deepball ranges from amazing to terrible. If he finds that consistency in his footwork gets his feet moving in the pocket then I think Wentz will take a huge leap in his game.I genuinely like more of Goffs mental game then Wentz I dont really like either to be honest. I like Wentz arm and throwing mechanics and I like Goffs ball placement and accuracy and footwork. I think both have huge gaps to overcome before they will be NFL QBs I just in particular think Goff will have an easier time on a shittier offense. Goff immobility in my opinion is compensated a bit by his pocket presence and foot movement. I like my QB to dance like the rd coming of footloose.Fisher definitely is a Wentz guy I agree with you there. I think Wentz would be great for the Rams if he could sit. I just really dont think the Rams will use a first overall and give the kid time. The NFL has no patience with young QBs and I think forcing Wentz will ruin him as a prospect.You are also right about the Bear raid it could very well be my higher opinions on Goffs intelligence are actually just the scheme. As I said I dont really like either QB. Both should sit and get time to flesh out their glaring weaknesses. ,LosAngelesRams,d239le5,1,t5_2rgnd

Im also into politics astronomy and science in general. I love this sub because I know like  Rams fans and they cant really name more than  players on the team. My other team is the Lakers so I cant wait for the future of that young core especially now that theyre adding Ingram.Overall I see myself as a pretty laidback guy with my main philosophy being treat others the way you want to be treated. I look forward to talking football with you guys and respect all of you for sticking with the Rams through this past decade. This sub will probably double to triple in the next year so the people that are here right now are pretty special in my book because youre pretty much the opposite of bandwagons even if you started liking the team yesterday.Go Rams!,LosAngelesRams,d3t9apq,5,t5_2rgnd

He goes to his secondary read maybe  times in that video if at all. He goes to his check down a handful of times too. Lot of accurate screens and short to medium throws not that accurate downfield... basically what his scouting report read. Hes executing what is being asked of him up to this point. Sharp and accurate throws. Results are good so far and thats all that you can ask for at this point. Hes doing well because of a coaching staff and game plan that caters to his strengths at the moment.

Definitely has great hands is capable of circus catches but thats not enough to make the  man.Hansens got more top end speed and is stronger. The circus catch and catch radius isnt as big as KLaws but still very good. I think he can be a productive NFL receiver. Hansen didnt catch many balls from Jared in games but Im sure they worked together in practice and know each other pretty well. I also think its a good idea to bring in a WR that has chemistry with Goff. Whether its Hansen or Chris HarperBryce TreggsKenny Lawleretc. ,LosAngelesRams,dc1qmfw,1,t5_2rgnd

10854811,0,t1_ddzkvyz,Quinn would be my guess hes athletic enough that he should be able to make the transition to OLB and hes the one that has been projected to make that switch. Standing up should be good for him though so we could get increased production from him hopefully..Everyones been saying that Wade runs his  defense like a  so we should expect that Quinn makes the transition to OLB but spends most of his time still getting around the edge to the QB.Perfect scenario is that Quinn becomes our Von Miller size wise theyre very similar.. Miller is   pounds runs a . . Quinn is   pounds and ran a . ... Miller is just slightly faster with a little more vertical and broadjump Quinn is just slightly bigger with more strength. They could have him slim down if hes not already to get closer to that Miller speed or keep him where he is.,LosAngelesRams,ddzlhyq,3,t5_2rgnd

11072794,0,t1_den1wrs,That is way more valuable you are right but the guarantee is the difference you know Tru is good you dont know Mr. CB is going to be good.  I get your point which is why they would have to work out the extension first and he cant be asking for  mil a year obviously or it wont work.  I know rookie pay scales dont work like this but I would take a Tru at  mil a year for  years  overall which is what basically the Browns would be looking at.But part of me feels like he is not happy to be a Ram and wants to move on.  Back to back years of no extension he has seen a lot of the defense especially his secondary appeared to be close with JJ and Rodney leave the team now McDonald is also leaving probably had to deal with the move and now a change in the coaching staff.  Oh yah on top of that we have not been good since he has been there and actually got worse last year.  I know the Browns are awful too but at least he has is old DC there and it is just a change.  This is just a feeling but I think I am right.,LosAngelesRams,den3abz,3,t5_2rgnd

Unfortunately I think the Browns FO is to good now to do a panic trade now that their guys have signed elsewhere but they still might feel some pressure to do the Tru trade if they want to upgrade their secondary.,LosAngelesRams,deq6vh2,3,t5_2rgnd

11699995,0,t1_dgm4vv9,I think with the two WR s we drafted last year woods and tavon we are okay still poor I agree though. I guess though I dont think we are necessarily more weak at  WR than we are at DB or some other spots. I also think that last years was as much coaching as talent so I am thinking mcvay lifts that unit anyway. I hope we get another good Te and another good  WR but I am also for our first pick just taking the best player across DBWRTE and maybe even other positions if thats what the coaches think is needed. ,LosAngelesRams,dgm7ojg,1,t5_2rgnd
11704567,0,t3_66hm6h,Ive posted about this a few times already but Im not a big Juju SmithSchuster fan. I spent more time being frustrated with his play than I spent being impressed by his playmaking. He was a complete ghost when teams keyed in on him e.g. Alabama Stanford and he was easily frustrated and made boneheaded decisions when things werent going his way e.g. Arizona. That said he did have some impressive plays and he is a physical receiver. Im just a little concerned that he seemed to regress from his sophomore to junior year was it because he received more attention from opposing DCs? as well as the fact that other USC WRs that were impressive in college havent panned out so well in the pros recently.,LosAngelesRams,dgmqdl4,1,t5_2rgnd

Im really excited for this draft class tbh I feel like a lot of people on here want the guys Mel Kiper likes but a lot of them guys dont even pan out. Cooper Kupp is gonna be a beast Im from PA I watched a little bit of Godwin his route running isnt something that youd fall in love with. I knew we werent going to draft Godwin cause of McVay liking guys who run good routes. Yea Godwin balled out in those couple big games but drafting a guy based on that is a waste imo Cooper Kupp has the accolades and has a tape of being consistent even against big name schools. Everyone likes to look at  time but look at some of the guys who ran insane  times a lot of them didnt even work out in the nfl speed is just one aspect of the game.
