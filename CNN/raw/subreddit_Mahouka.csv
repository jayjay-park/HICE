9267350,0,t1_d8qny6i,Usually WNs are written without editors. Also most of the later half of Arifureta is translated by Machine Translators. The difference in Arifureta WNvsLN are not a lot only details and chapter order.Im not saying its bad just that maybe it wont be at the level of Overlord or Mahouka.I dont really care if its machine translated. Hell I finished Arifureta by reading summaries so yeah. Depends on the reader.,Mahouka,d8qpaw2,1,t5_31c3i

11451358,0,t3_63c87c,This could also be explained by the fact that after a magic sequence takes place the environment returns to its normal reactions. His mass of psions is too thick for magic to get in to affect him but nonmagical attacks still work on him. I.e. Compressing air to create an explosion would likely still affect Tomitsuka because while he can stop the psions from compressing the air he cant stop the air from exploding from the compressed state to a noncompressed state. TLDRHes still affected by magic that does not hit him directly like explosions. ,Mahouka,dfu03cf,3,t5_31c3i
