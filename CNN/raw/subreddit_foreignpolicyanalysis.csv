3697832,0,t1_cqdhkcb,Im not an expert in economics and I see your point about China specifically but we run deficits with most nations.  This gives the US leverage with a lot of nations is it really just happy coincidence?  Couldnt monetary and fiscal policy be used to affect this?,foreignpolicyanalysis,cqds04l,2,t5_2xkxb
4009665,0,t1_crd8o9u,I understand what youre saying but I guess my bone of contention is with the difference between a perspective and a theory. I always believed a theory is a general set of assumptions that can be applied to various scenarios to explain something that requires it. I might be horribly wrong though haha. What do you define as a perspective and as a theory if you dont mind me asking? ,foreignpolicyanalysis,crdbz53,3,t5_2xkxb
