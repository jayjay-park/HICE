If he gets an uptilt at low percents its gonna be a lot of percent on and even at high percents it still can lead to a kill or a terrible position. Ive never played a Palu so I went with what bitman thought about her. Luigi and Zelda I havent really played so I only theroized.Wario can avoid pressure pretty easy thanks to high mobility we have to be careful with gyros since he can heal charge waft with it. He is pretty hard to grab and is heavy so our grab stuff is even less likely to confirm to a kill. DH I talked with Mr. Eric with and he says its either even or in ROBs favor since we have a hard time recovering against him.DeDeDe just keep out with gyros and abuse grabs fairs downtilts. He should eat up a heavy percent before we even get close to killing. R.O.B. has all the tools needed to do well vs bayo but he also gets punished pretty hard by her. He does the worst out of all the characters that do well vs her. You just need to play the matchup right and keep her out with projectiles punish bad heel slidesabks grab a lot and dont do some standard ROB things like Nair. ,ROBMains,d2qbwbj,1,t5_39b9m
