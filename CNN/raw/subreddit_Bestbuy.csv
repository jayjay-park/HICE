7079451,0,t3_4ajpwa,Alright let me level with you. First off we have two kinds of trucks. White goods Appliances Tvs over  etc. And Brown goodsThe rest of the store. Now I work in a probably medium to small sized store. White goods usually has    pieces    pieces for Holidays. Brown goods    pieces     pieces Holidays. Truck is usually a bulky shift. Holidays can even be  hours. I work part time Inventory and I can usually break  hours a week with two full times and two other part timers also in staff. During the holidays I was pulling in over  hours a week with the four trucks a week. I usually get scheduled about  to  hours a week. But I pick up shifts to make it much greater. I love my job and the people I work with have a lot to do with it. My managers and supervisors all are very involved and are willing to help those who are actually there to work and and show it. The best buy youre wanting to work at could be a lot different. Both in people and in size. My store is like a k a year store. So were not too big. But keep in mind that Best Buy is very focused around the customer experience. They want every customer to be greeted and helped. You will not walk passed a customer without greeting them. Its a much different atmosphere than Walmart or Sams Club. I worked at Sams I can only gauge my comparison from there. Jeez TLDR Best Buy is good but way different from Walmart. The people you work with canwill make or break your job experience. And hours for part time arent from my experience less than  hours a week at least for inventory. Part time on the sales floor I hear is hell. Like  hours a week hell. ,Bestbuy,d1itjz6,1,t5_2rofz

Next day get a larger black woman. Now this woman holy cow her nails were like an inch and a half long with thick gold nail polish glitter EVERYWHERE. She had gold Eyeliner More freaking glitter Had a Fancy purse also glittery... Anyway so she came up saying she wanted a MacBook well this flagged for me because of the events of the day before but I gave her the benefit of the doubt She said she wanted to apply for a bestbuy credit card Okay cool I get her ID which was out of state nd flag but not enough to call fraud started entering everything in and she was cooperative. Well it gets to the end and prompts me to call the bank I tell her itll be just a moment. I talk to the nice guy at CitiBank and go through the hoops he wants to speak to her confirm her identity and all. Now at this point shes getting annoyed tapping her nails and rolling her eyes. rd Flag at this point I knew it was fraud About half way through talking to the guy she says Why do I need to talk to the bank? you know what just forget it I dont want to do this and HANGS UP on the guy and leaves pretty quick.

You just explain things to people why they are good and why they should buy it.  Its literally just talking to people.  Anybody half competent is going to be getting GS and apps.Sales people fail because they ignore customers or get hung up on pointless shit like customers saying HDM UBS or other stupid inconsequential shit.  Look at the stupid comments here.  Isnt it annoying when a customer says they want a good cheap blah blah blah.  No its your job to explain to them why x is better than y.  Its literally your only expectation and the thing you get paid money to do.  Honestly most of your job can be replaced by reading the tag or the box.I constantly hear Ooohhh but I have sales goals... while inventory has a  piece double stacked white goods truck  drop shipments that need to be received  OMS orders that need picked a shit ton of paperwork usually the result of sales people fuckups service to create and ship recycling to process trade ins that needs shipped receiving to put out delivery drivers to help white goods to put up product to locate you are too lazy to find yourself and do your carry outs for you.  Now think about how this whole time I am never once told good job.  You know how you guys got PTE for apps or are entered into contests?  None of that shit is available to us.  When we do our jobs well nobody even notices us.Think of it this way.  Anybody in inventory can talk to a customer about products.  Hell home theater would ask our one guy questions all the time and Im probably more knowledgeable than half the computer department.

Testing SD card is simple and takes a whole two seconds you should be doing this on everything because it will save you time from having to do it again when it gets returned because you failed to test everything the first time around.

We go off of what OMS lets us schedule theres no way for us to know what side of the city or even if its in the same city the delivery team will be on. gt Other than like dropping a fridge I cant even think how the drivers would fuck up. Even then it wouldnt affect the sales person more than ordering a new one. the incredibly common delays because a truck didnt go out for whatever reason this we only find out about after customers are calling us demanding to know where their delivery is because its been hours past their delivery window When theres a fridge and the delivery guys go this one needs a four man crew and they just leave it in the customers garage except it isnt one that needs four and were left at the store looking stupid rescheduled the very angry customer btw and needed to make no special arrangements for a four man crew after her delivery even she said why couldnt the first two guys who came out do it when they were here? idk lady the real martyrs of the company are the delivery drivers. please dont question their actions If the units are delivered with damage the delivery team is supposed to offer the customer compensation to keep it. I cant tell you how many times Ive been called and told the delivery guys said the store would take care of it all we needed to do was call but the delivery guys still got paid for a job completed so they are AOK while we are left trying to deal with yet another issue to escalate. When they deliver the totally wrong microwave model and color and tell the customer thats the one on the order. Salesperson mustve messed up except we didnt. It was all correct on our side but again they got paid for a job completed so they are AOK again!I have plenty more but maybe its different when you can deliver out of your store. The only way we can contact the warehouse is through escalations and weve been told to settle down on those by the store manager. I know the sales people have messed up plenty but I have filed more escalations about the delivery team than about anything else. gtEven then it wouldnt affect the sales person more than ordering a new one.Yeah. At that point if the unit is in stock the earliest delivery date is out at least  days for us. It would be nice if people were all understanding but for the most part I brace myself for an earful when this happens. I can only cross my fingers that the customer doesnt get a hold of the store manager so he can once again look over to us and wonder how Pacific Kitchen and Home is fucking everything up yet again. All of our escalations recently have solidified our position on his radar.At least you can communicate with your sales people we cant communicate with the warehouse without getting a finger wagged in my face about too many escalations.gtIf somebody is getting shit its most definitely the drivers because of the sales people.Its hard for me to sympathise.,Bestbuy,d5cwysz,3,t5_2rofz

Have some respect for the role.Also read the Geek Squad webpage and become familar with the point pledge history and whatever else is listed. The role of Geek Squad is not for everyone it takes something special.Each precinct will be a little different. Your priorities are client interactions and handling the counter. You will be doing POS checkins checkouts selling GSPs and GS services and what not. You need technical skills in your retailtech support role. You need great soft skills and attention to detail. You need to be able to communicate effectively and multitask by the minute when it gets busy. You will learn your role with time after you complete something like  different trainings online some are tested IRL before you even are allowed on the floor or uniform and eventually attend Geek Squad Academy for about a week maybe even Sales Induction which is about a week also.In specific details since everyone covered the basics in notjargon You will be doing funct checks GSCOB tagging creating license plates pulling up receipts when necessary from Nova and CMS trainingstutorials scheduling placing calls shippingreceiving mission assurance DTLs SOP on paperwork filings RE exchanges selling renewals demoing escalations performing SOs and etc.The CA is the frontline and is the foot in the door position where you can get into other roles such as ARA Deputy Autotech Installer etc. You never know what you will face in the next hour you need to be flexible and on your toes for those times. You will have challenges and you need to meet them. Most importantly the role gets you prepared to advance if you are successful in your role.Our precinct is small and understaffed with a growing client base so CAs will take on the ARA role at times and the ARAs will take on the CA role though less frequently.I love everything about GS and this is my dream job. Had my first computer a  Toshiba that ran Windows  up to Windows ME before it finally died when I was  years old. Been in technology roles since I was  working for the US government in IT then in corporate America IT for a spell then GS. I have quite a resume and I can say that nothing is like GS.

11214563,0,t3_600z9k,This is a fun question. TVs are kind of subjective which is why youll get a lot of different answers. It comes down to what the TV is being used for and where it is going. This is where an associate stops you and asks a bunch of questions and tries to get an idea of your situation. Unfortunately all I know is you have a budget of  youre a college student and you are putting it in a bedroom so there will be a little inference. Anyway lets get started! The Samsung ku at  is good at that price point. It is a k set it has smart features built in and decent color. I assume since you are a college student streaming and gaming are important to you. The upsides are this TV will be a good monitor for gaming low input lag it is from Samsung which usually has bright color and it has smart features and an app store built in.  Now the downsides are it is missing important features. Motion will be blurry on this set for sports movies and gaming because it has a low refresh rate. The set does not have any color enhancing technology and does not do HDR for PS pro or Xbox one S.Next the Vizio  Mseries! This is in the price range at . Vizio is a brand that has good bang for buck but they cut corners to get there. Pros are that it will have good motion it does work fantastic as a monitor and you have HDR compatibility. It will read the content and play it back but it isnt true HDR. The cons are... its technically not a TV. There is no tuner built in for coaxial connections and it relies on another device for smart features. You HAVE to use either the provided tablet or your own device to set up the Home Theater Display and to use smart features through Chromecast. So if that sounds unpleasant pass. I get too many returns on Vizio units because of this.Now if you can drop a little more or get our best buy credit card and finance there are two more options.Yet again Vizio  PSeries! At k we get some cool features. The upside is great contrast between the dark black and bright white scenes true HDR and Dolby Vision and yet again great motion and input lag. The downsides are the same as the Vizio Mseries but if you like the increase in picture quality at this price point get a Roku or something for smart features. Last the infamous Samsung KS This comes in at  BUT hear me out. This set will have the best combination of picture quality and features out of all the options. This model is known as being a great priced TV for the features it comes with. If you get the chance to stop by and see the SUHD lineup from Samsung you can see the bright vibrant detailed color you get from the quantum dot technology. This set will have actual HDR capability. Motion is great on this set as well input lag is low so yet again great for gaming  and all the smart features are built in. This set does come with a fancy remote you can talk to so theres that. Now the downside is price but it really is the best of all four options. If there is anything important I skipped over let me know! ,Bestbuy,df35obm,7,t5_2rofz
