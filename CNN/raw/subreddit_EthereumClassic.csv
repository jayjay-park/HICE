8892407,0,t3_52184n,ethereumcharles actually for point  the answer is quite clear and weve even gained legal advice on this and highlighted this in the community. Technically the funds involved with the DAO hack connected to attacker RHGWHG are all funds under dispute. Are they classified as misappropriated is not the point. Any funds received that are under dispute need to be ringfenced. On a Blockchain this is easy to do. Any funds received from an address connected with any of the above and where there is doubt should be sent to a ringfenced multisig address and not be used until appropriate clarification through normal legal recourse. I am looking into if these funds can be used to paycover legal expenses related to resolution of their use. So technically this is a non issue and just needs to be dealt with aswhen it occurs. I have respect for you and the academic work you are involved in and await eagerly on the tangible deliverables. But one negative part the fact that you made the rude remark to Chucksq on slack was totally uncalled for and in my opinion highlights that you do not fully appreciate or understand the level of work many people in the community are doing and the personalfinancial costs they are incurring. For example if you talked to Chucksq you will see the amount of great work he is doing and has planned and after such a chat you will likely realise you really dont need to go far to hire an awesome community manger!All other points in your post are interesting and worth a good public debate. ,EthereumClassic,d7gqotb,10,t5_3fgtx

9277654,0,t3_57fidb,gtIf that is true it is possible that a lot of these users and miners will upgrade on Monday and their clients will follow the new notbackwards compatible gas calculation rules. Which will lead to a network split. Sorry for being dense but I need an ELI clarification.  Are you saying that the new client that will be released on Monday contains code that will detect nonupdated clients and refuse to connect with them?  So in other words it enforces a network split?If so it is important for us to decide if we should update to this client or not.  If we were to upgrade to the new EF client even if just temporarily that would give us a stable functioning network and buy us time so the ETC devs can follow up with our own ETC branded client.  Even if that just involves pulling the EF client code and tweaking it to make the classic chain the default.  On the other hand if the ETC devs have a similar update planned for the very near future which accomplishes the same thing then maybe we should hold off.Right now the gas prices are out of whack and if we dont fix it we remain vulnerable to DoS attacks which we were spared from for awhile but have recently been subjected to just like the ETH chain.Hopefully we can all discuss this rationally and move forward in unity.,EthereumClassic,d8s0cgh,2,t5_3fgtx

10027257,0,t1_dbeig2n,Parity and etcgeth both have the code in place already  for the difficulty bomb delay and replay protection. Both are currently running on testnet to locate edge cases that would cause problems. The dag may be an issue in the future but it depends on GPU ram development. So not a right now fork but on the radar maybe. ,EthereumClassic,dbekuzn,2,t5_3fgtx

10506492,0,t1_dcwfdix,ETHF was created so devs could steal money that didnt belong to them according to the rules they themselves and the dao contract devs established. But they chose greed and censorship over decentralization and trust and been falling in value ever since. They  only got  carbon vote and  hash vote to fork and they did it anyway. They made a central decision to change everything about eth for personal profit but changed nothing on their website claims fraud. They hired shills to tell people that being against censorship means defending hacking and theft which they are independent. Sorry you got mindbent weak minds and all cant process thoughts like normal people.ETC is not original eth either. Original eth died when ethereum decided to defraud everyone.real history I also suspect you need to read for few years ,EthereumClassic,dcz0t8k,2,t5_3fgtx
