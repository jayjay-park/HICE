8281851,0,t1_d5crarz,Still looking! For bouldering Im open to early morning or evenings at Dogpatch. At Mission I would prefer the mornings because it is absolutely packed after  pm. Lately Ive been going MonWedFri with an extra day thrown in if I feel rested but I can do other days as well. ,ClimbingPartners,d5csh0y,1,t5_2sbho
