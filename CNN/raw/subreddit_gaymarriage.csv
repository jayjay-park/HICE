4604952,0,t1_ct8s5e9,gtYou seem to think a business needs to be run by rabid bigots who consistently discriminate against their customers in order to be guilty of discrimination.Not at all. I was quite clear actually. I simply presented a hypothetical scenario in which we were able to KNOW that it wasnt about sexual orientation but instead about not wanting to participate in a ceremony that runs in direct contradiction to their faith. I asked if you would be okay with their denial of service in such a scenario however your nonanswer was actually an answer as it confirms for me that you believe that there is no scenario in which a person could have religious convictions that might run contrary to another. It confirms that you believe their motivations could only be inspired by a desire to discriminate. This would explain why this conversation has been going in circles. Do you admit to as much? Please confirm either way while making sure to leave out any references to rabid bigots and simply reply to the question with a simple yes or no.gtRegardless we know what the bakers thought process was This couple is gay and wants a cake for their wedding. We dont support gay marriage for religious reasons so were going to refuse service to this gay couple.Thats what I said. Thats the scenario I presented. Youre making it out to look like it was an issue of gay discrimination.gtThe issue of the customers sexuality is inescapableWait a second... you just admitted that you believe their reasons were of a religious nature and literally in the very next sentence youre claiming otherwise????? gtThe couples sexual orientation and the fact that they were getting married was the only factor that went into the bakers decision to refuse to bake their wedding cake by your own admission.Youre making a leap by implying bigotry for their denial of service. Lets get one thing clear. A Christian or any person with religious convictions for that matter is absolutely legally morally and constitutionally allowed to deny service for those religious reasons. The problem here is that you see this issue as one that is too simple... that being A cake was denied to a gay couple  automatic bigotry.You might disagree with the law. You might disagree with the moral stance. You might even disagree with the constitutionally guaranteed protections for those who might want to act on their religious liberty however I wish you would just say THAT rather than trying to impose separate motivations for their actions.gtTheir refusal to treat customers belonging to a protected class equally to customers who do not belong to a protected class fits the legal definition of discrimination  thats the action that got them sued.It would have been discrimination ONLY had the denied service be due to their sexual orientation. Thats an important distinction. If it were about their sexual orientation then they would have denied service every previous time the couple entered the store. It was simply the fact that the ceremony was in direct contradiction to their religious beliefs and as a result they felt they could not participate. While were on the subject of discrimination... What do you have to say about the gay couples refusal to accept the rational of the Christian bakers protected class status? In this instance the act of suing is the legal definition of discrimination because the gay couple was indeed aware of their religious reservations and they knew that a legal ruling would force the bakery to choose between acting against their religious convictions or going out of business.gtI dont know how many times I can say it even if they did not discriminate against these gay customers in the past and whether or not they hate gay people fundamentally does not matter.It shows intent. Your only case here is to assume that their attitude suddenly changed from one of one not being discriminatory on sexual orientation or for any other reason... serving gays all the time every time then to one single instance where they decided to discriminate based on sexual orientation and then back to serving gays all the time every time. Do you not see how ridiculous that is? If not were left with you simply believing that religious protections should not exist... something that I believe weve already discovered but you have yet to confirm. If the latter is true then Im through with this dialog as it tells me that you are the one with a desire to discriminate... upon Christians as well as those with other religious convictions.Ill say it again Its important to keep in mind that they would be legally morally and constitutionally allowed to deny service for a religious issue for which there was indeed one with the introduction of a requirement to participate in the wedding. The problem here is that you have no evidence for this assumed change in mindset and yet there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary.gtTheir refusal to bake a cake for their wedding because the couple getting married were gay is the legal definition of disparate treatment and is discriminatory and is illegal. Is that simple enough for you?Youre wrong. Im going to say this a third time so that it sinks in. They would be legally morally and constitutionally allowed to deny service for a religious issue for which there was indeed one with the introduction of a requirement to participate in the wedding.Any response you provide should either reflect full knowledge and acceptance of that fact or be a clear indication  that you realize it to be both true and legally binding but disagree. Anything else is simply unnecessary.,gaymarriage,ctb1ga3,1,t5_2qzah
