387267,0,t3_1yfv8u,I have a few issues with this article. The first is the sort of supposition that romance novels wouldnt be seen as inferior reading material if they were not targeted so heavily to a female demographic. While I agree that misogyny might play a part in this the truth of the matter is that romance fiction is almost universally horrible. It is just terrible writing that can easily been seen as what it is exploitative of women with specific social needs that are met by the novels. There are definitely analogues that target the male demographic mystery novels are what immediately come to mind. From an academic literature standpoint pretty much all genre fiction is guilty of this because they unironically adhere to tropes. Then we get into pure presentism. It is unfair and not useful to attack old texts for not adhering to moral frameworks that werent invented yet. We can analyze how existing moral frameworks exist in the text but it isnt useful to blame someone for not agreeing with an idea that they didnt come into contact with. This is why we can be extremely vitriolic about misogyny in Twilight and why misogyny in Catcher is instead in the realm of analysis. Twilight is from our time in our culture and thats why we can evaluate it as a product of our time and our culture. To interpret Shakespeare like it was written yesterday is dishonest and an analytical dead end. Is Twilight a positive force for teen girls and teen girl culture? Having read parts of the books I cant help but think that the message being presented is really clear and portrays a very hurtful ideal of how women should be in relationships. I find it hard to believe that camaraderie resulting from shared interest in the book would be wholly healthy.  ,SRSBusiness,cfkwmj5,1,t5_2t5m9

I was just wondering if they made the distinction going into the research like Asian ethnicities A and Asian ethnicities B. Or if they were making distinctions based on the results. Like Asians from these ethnicities had x results but Asians from these ethnicities got y results.Sorry.
