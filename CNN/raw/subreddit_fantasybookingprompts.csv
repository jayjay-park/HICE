9802729,0,t1_dalb8ii,Thanks. I was thinking about the Million Dollar Title at the time and I thought itd be a good joke type thing for him. Like Summer tells him he needs a title to help build his brand even more but instead of going for the one he just creates his own. ,fantasybookingprompts,dalebbo,1,t5_3ecya
