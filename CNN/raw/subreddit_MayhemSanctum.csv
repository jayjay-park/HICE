1232083,0,t3_287k9z,My only issue with this application would be your duping issues in the past. The same thing would happen here if youre caught duping. With how easy it is to get resources we shouldnt have a need to dupe things. I hope that sort of behavior is in the past. Ill be whitelisting you shortly.,MayhemSanctum,ci885vo,1,t5_2v0x9

With the limit to it being on a different server i think it balances out because you have to hand mine things anyways. Something that could be done is to have the Digital miner and other forms of ridiculously easy automated mining restricted to players who have progressed threw the challenges. Mfr lasers arnt bad because of the immense power drain and relatively slow speed But quarriesDM seem to take to little for what they give and basically allow you to beat the game as soon as its done.Onto the issue with the less hardcore players why dont we have a option for players to opt in for challenging goals or not. You can at the begining make a choice as to wether or not you want to participate as some people might not. By doing this we give the players that choose to go down the harder path extra access to certain things such as double ore worlds Name coloringBraging rights possibly even an increased amount of loadable area for that person. Not sure about the technical stuff behind that but im sure something can be done. This is just a suggestion let me know what you think.To summerize sets of players One for casuals and One for Hardcores.Casuals get nothing special but dont have to go threw the hoops of the challenges.Hardcores will recive special rewards only to them giving the people that dont care for the challanges to not have quite as many perks but allows them to play normally without worrying about them and allowing the challenges to be as hard as wanted without upsetting the balance.,MayhemSanctum,cilef1t,2,t5_2v0x9
