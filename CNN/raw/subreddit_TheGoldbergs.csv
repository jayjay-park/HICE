9022506,0,t3_53ultm,Haha.. Dawsons Creek warfare. Those were the days. Im still loyal to my unpopular pick in that war too.  But yeah  Goldbergs. Id say Erica and Geoff will end up together but not anytime soon.,TheGoldbergs,d7wd46p,6,t5_2x7xo
9914978,0,t1_dazpfvj,Just watched the intro again out of curiosity and I didnt see anybody saying it was July before the line saying its December. But I lean somewhat on captioning because of hearing loss so its always possible I may have missed something.   But you guys are right that its out of place to have Murray say its  degrees out and having the outdoor scenes reflecting that if its supposed to be December. Definitely an odd slip up there.  Though they do that thing were meanwhile while EricaBarryAdam is doing something at night AdamBarryErica is still at school doing this other thing a lot haha. Ah sitcoms!,TheGoldbergs,dazy1ls,3,t5_2x7xo
