Its the system that Im mostly concerned with. The capitalist system encourages people to be assholes thats how they rise above it all. Trump is a perfect example.But politically theyre targets because theyre representations of the exploitation inherent in the system. The fact that many of them do not give a shit and are willing to flagrantly be apart of it is a problem for example Martin Shkreli.,TheYugeProject,d0n1s94,1,t5_3cxwa
