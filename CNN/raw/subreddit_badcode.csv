552811,0,t1_cfuv9ka,gt Python happens to lack a nested loop break statement. A simple goto would be handier and much more readable than guard booleans when breaking out of nested loops of some complexity.Pretty much anything is better than guard booleans. Rather than using a hack use the constructs that are available and commonly used. Namely break and raise. Often higherorder constructs solve the problem in an even nicer way.Its not rampant OCD not to want to use a poor unsafe way of handling line jumps much as it isnt OCD not to want to use raw pointers.

The correct form would be    hookt adr  hookt ampglobalhookst  hooktypeEDIT Actually no itd be    hookt adr  hookt ampglobalhookst  hooktypeOr something like that. I hope Im interpreting this right. And the intended unit of pointer arithmetic is probably sizeofhookt.Second why not just define globalhookst as an array of hookt and have an enum of hook types?

9264738,0,t1_d8pp9jn,Threads are not interleaved the way you are thinking of. Instead depending on the OS and the compilers thread scheduling implementation each thread will usually get a quantum a set amount of time to run and threads will run until they reach their quantum they finish their work or the process what the threads run inside. You can think of a process as a company and threads are the employees is swapped out due to a context switch so that another process can run. So it will never be a perfect one thread adds one then the other thread decrements one going back and forth. Instead due to the nature of the system and how expensive context switches between different threads and different processes can be we get what we saw here where one thread does a lot of work until it is forced to stop and let the other thread do its work.,badcode,d8qddtl,0,t5_2u568
