But you shouldnt be surprised to get a backlash when your views are expressed as racist negative hostile and bigoted. When you express that towards an audience and you fail to realize you are being offensive then other people have the right to take it as offensive and demand you stop. You refuse to listen.There is a clear difference between expressing your views and spreading hatred. Learn that difference.And learn to not attack other people based off their religion. You went from you do this and you do that to Jehovahs Witnesses do this and that. A bit ad hominem dont you think? A bit of a generalization dont you think?,the49,chl8tq1,1,t5_2tfk5
