It would allow those who are killed say their piece before they die.  Not sure how balance it would be but might be good for new players to play.,DailyMafia,coxecui,1,t5_2yv0e

8192300,0,t1_d517n00,I agree once you build that image around yourself it makes people doubt you more. And it only works when you are  right. It has also put town in a unwinnable position before. Extremely high risk and seldom works.  It was just that it did work when town was in a bad spot that made it sick in my mind . As you say thats never a play a inexperienced player like me could pull of. You calling it in final  was sick btw D,DailyMafia,d51l7pf,2,t5_2yv0e
