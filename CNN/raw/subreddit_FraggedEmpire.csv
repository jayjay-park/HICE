3169819,0,t3_2w5p04,Things look to be shaping up great Wade! This book is going to get a place of pride on my shelf when it arrives!,FraggedEmpire,coqjtks,2,t5_32pwq
3206123,0,t1_cou0i2p,Hello Wade!About the Dust Cloud allow me to propose another readIf your spacecraft starts its Turn or enters a Dust Cloud it takes damage equal to its current Velocity. No attack roll is necessary and an automatic Strong Hit Critical Hit is caused against your spacecraft at  Shields.About the Command RollOne of my players namely Michael thought it doesnt make sense to be forced to always change direction by turning  degrees when you perform a Full Burn action. It made more sense to him that you should be able to turn only as Maneuver action.On the same note I believe that when you perform a Full Burn as the name suggests you should be able to only modify your spacecrafts Velocity and Maneuver to deal with all the turning. Example below Full Burn Crew Alter the spacecrafts Velocity equal to your Engine Maneuver      Size x Turn  degrees and alter Velocity     Size x Turn  degrees and alter VelocityDo tell me how those above would feel in a gameplay from your perspective.Besides the above issue the spacecraft combat feels a bit clunky at first look but it makes sense as you roll with it. The issue begins when you have a group of  players because theyll either sit through whole combat or theyll just aid the others when they fail their System Rolls which in turn means that one or more players will simply not be engaged in what it looks to me a fun activity.Extra Section alleviates this to some extent but it doesnt look very friendly yet which might scare those new to the system. Those accustomed will simply avoid it by assigning a fighter of Size  to one of them and launch it along with some other unmanned crafts which in a man group is cool to have four of them on the big ship and the fifth on a spacecraft leading the assault with some unmanned combat fliers  .In conclusion I have not tested the system with more than four players at my table and I cannot really put my finger if there is something odd or not with the spacecraft combat for a larger group of players and thus if you have any hindsight on the matter please give me a pointer in the right direction.Cheers!,FraggedEmpire,coubb1l,1,t5_32pwq
3592932,0,t1_cpzqh3x,For melee one of my participants Ioana Reyachan was complaining about the utility of the Infestor Whip weapon. It is a cool melee exotic weapon with Strong Hit on  but it does not allow any variations which cuts a lot of its oomph.The Infestor Whip is easily outclassed by other melee weapons like ElectroGrav Gauntlet or even thee balanced weapons be them claw hammer or composite. First one has the range and the second group has the possibility of variations.Two variants can be considered for the Infestor Whip Increase the range from Melee to Range  but keep it a melee weapon too OR Allow it to also accept Melee Variations.The first option keeps the Infestor Whip on par with the ElectroGrav Gauntlet from Range standpoint and makes it a somewhat valid and cool replacement.The second option makes the Infestor Whip cool but costly as Variations add to its already expensive resource cost. But it adds the versatility required to compete with ElectroGrav Gauntlet.Cheers!,FraggedEmpire,cq1tkt6,1,t5_32pwq
4642165,0,t3_3dwk84,For the beta testing I ran a really lighthearted game set where a lot of the story hooks were complete happenstance because of the things a Drazzed out legion character would do to try and get more Draz. It turned out to be hilarious.,FraggedEmpire,ctfplwf,1,t5_32pwq
4663796,0,t1_cthpdbb,gt I had primarily henchmen and splash weapons in mind because splash weapons are said to be super effective against henchmen. A shotgun hitting  henchmen could only kill  of those. On the other hand hitting a defence  square instead a defence  henchmen is still pretty good DOh sorry for the lack of clarity regarding  End and Critical Hits. I presumed you meant vs  Target.A splash weapon can kill lots of Henchmen if they are all clumped up as Targets at  End always receive a Critical Hit from Attacks that hit them and cause Damage.I think I may need to adjust the rules to explain this point more clearly.,FraggedEmpire,ctifdnd,1,t5_32pwq
5071948,0,t1_cux7aab,Thanks a lot for taking the time to answer the questions in such detail. You did actually describe it quite well in the core rulebook but I guess its hard to understand it all correctly before playing Im pretty amazed how you could have come up with something so complex and were able to bring it to paper in such a good way. Thumbs up sir. Wrist BladeWith St  and Wilderness talent it actually does  Endurance and  Critical Damage. Ill consider the Dual Wield option. RoF  would allow me to add another d and that increases hit and the chance of a strong hit correct? And later with Martial Art I would have RoF  which would allow me to add d? Since the wristblade has no ammunition etc. this seems to be rather powerful because I would use it all the time without any negative effect. I think I saw some modification with penetration  min . That still wouldnt give me attribute damage against a foe with armor  or more. I can only hope they have armor deductions with Endurance .Since the wristblade counts as a gauntlet and has a load of  what does this mean if Im dual wielding it and would want to throw a grenade or throwing weapon? I do believe a grenade has a load of . So I dont need to use any action to put away a wristblade and just need one to load and one to throw a grenade? ,FraggedEmpire,cuxd18q,1,t5_32pwq
6223842,0,t3_40p3hc,Thanks for your eagerness Lets see if we can get something started.This is a link to a Google Doc that I spent only min making. It is the start of a Space Wars  Laser Monks Space Scoundrels amp Bounty Hunters setting hack.ANYONE can edit or add to this document.Please feel free to jump in any add to it. I have put no work into balancing so feel free to change any stats.This will be a great test project for us as a community as I feel like this setting would be the easiest to create and it is something that we all love the newest movie was awesome. It only really requires the creation of Force powersskillweapons and a set of new races.Rules alterationsthoughtsideas for this setting Discard all Traits and Equipment that refer to Electro Gravity. Change all Refrences to Psionics to be the Force.  All Psionic Traits with Max Foc Requirement are now changed to Min Foc and increase that number by  eg Max Foc  becomes Min Foc . Discard Races use new list. Discard all Racial Trait Requirements GM Discretion. Surgery can not replace lost limbs unless you take an Implant Trait.We need to create a LightDark side Force mechanic maybe Force users can use Face to fuel their powers?I feel like lots if not all Force PowersWeapons should require Secret Knowledge making Force characters a Research focused style of play this will also help to balance them with other players as they will be spending all their spare time on Research while the Eg Bounty Hunter Character will be spending their Spare Time on modding their equipment.,FraggedEmpire,cyx30aw,1,t5_32pwq

6569057,0,t3_45li62,it wouldnt make sense to have a spaceship deal  damage to another spaceship but when targeting a person it also deals  damage.FFGs SW games increase the damage dealth by  so that might be something to take inspiration from.I got an idea just now that ship weapons if they hit they can get reduced hit chance against small targets they will always deal their listed damage bypassing endurance armor and shields. effectivly dealing direct attribute damage.,FraggedEmpire,czysmgt,1,t5_32pwq

6743014,0,t1_d0g5tph,The scatter distance can be a bit funny I think. In my campaign I had a legion pirate shoot a particle canon shot after one of my PCs. He had defense  and I rolled a  or so so the shot ended up scattering twice the distance of the initial shot off to the side of the map. It was both hilarious and stupid.He changed tactics to shoot for the ground to just get the splash after that.,FraggedEmpire,d0gs9rg,1,t5_32pwq

7191070,0,t1_d19vr1a,Hi! Im beginning work on the subject and Im considering creating sets of random tables. In keeping with the mechanics and flavor of Fragged Empire Im considering using d rolls for every table and adapting the Strong Hit mechanic to add extras to the result rolled. Each table would include two parts the main table with entries numbered  to  and then a small list of extras which the GM can obtain with Strong Hits. For example if rolling a random space encounter table the GM gets a  that might be a Delerict Spaceship but if that  got a Strong Hit perhaps the Delerict Ship is already being salvaged by scavengers and with  Strong Hits perhaps there are both scavengers and the parasiteinfested walking corpses of the original crew. What do you think about this system?,FraggedEmpire,d1vkbc7,1,t5_32pwq
7274959,0,t3_4f176u,Its both.  End and  Crit.Edit but remember you still need to spend a Strong Hit on a Critical Hit for Attribute Damage. Mechonds are REALLY nasty when they score  Strong Hits.,FraggedEmpire,d25448j,2,t5_32pwq
7330723,0,t1_d2bg28d,Hard to say.  For more complex standardized artificial environments yeah if you want it to look really clean.  These days Id probably use Manga Studio for noncomplex ones just because the inking tools would make parts of it hilariously fast and clean to do.All depends on what sort of map I want to make.  If I was doing a digital adventure over the web Id probably do something more full color because Id want to present it as an actual environment.  Which means Id probably break out my copy of Dundjinni for the interiors and Krita for the exteriors and do them that way.As a DM I find excel great because I can measure everything in  foot increments which makes setting up a room as easy as click and drag Ctrl and two clicks.  It only works great for interior or settled environments though  caves curvyrooms natural environments and the like do not fit comfortably inside excel.,FraggedEmpire,d2bgbvl,2,t5_32pwq

7630293,0,t1_d39h0wx,i dunno if  resource is the way to fix it... thats kinda like just requiring an extra levelup and some trading.in my experience players want to see a Lesser Version Of A Cool Thing at lower level and then build it up to something more cool. Just making it cost  resource just means you cant  have this until much later and in a new game thats not real  exciting.unfortunately i dont have a better solution to offer except maybe reducing the crit by one and adding  crit to some of the variations so that they become more potent as much as they are now only after being upgradedthanks for all the replies btw. i know ive got a lot of posts with questions and comments right now  ,FraggedEmpire,d39iugb,3,t5_32pwq
7656377,0,t3_4k5q62,cool mounts are and fun...havent had the ability to play test yet but i would argue they are necessary for a scifi setting fun or not. thus tweaking may be needed but do NOT do away with them.,FraggedEmpire,d3chk3y,1,t5_32pwq

8760691,0,t3_502ocm, Yes a Kaltoran could theoretically be as strong as a Legion. It wouldnt be normal but theres nothing preventing a hulking musclehead Kaltoran. HeShe would definitely stand out! By the Rules as Written attributes do not affect Skill Rolls but the GM could give a Description Bonus based upon how high or low ones Attribute is. For example if Im a scientist who says I want to use logic to convince a a scientific convention about the merits of my research the GM may call for a Conversation roll with a bonus for having a high Intelligence. The way I usually play it is If the Attribute is  or less   or    no bonus.      .,FraggedEmpire,d70qwp3,5,t5_32pwq
8765519,0,t3_5021lr,The main issue is that itll derive into a doesnt matter just respawn situation where the party go well our lives are more important than the local nonimmortal population so Id much rather go into the next fight with  hp and  spare time than with  perception and neardeath where a team just finishes the area and then they suicide to be back on full.Priority one for these systems Prevent death being the easy way out. Death should have the same or higher penalties to the player than survival and healing since its wrong to expect everybody in a gothic setting to be a goodytwoshoes who thinks that every life is valuable. For every Goku theres a Vegeta. Depending on the setting you want death to still be shunned rather than just to be a rather meaningless inconvenience to ALL people not just the Lawful Good. Once that critical point has been achieved then looking into parts like this though I would leave it to GM discretion as to which they may be as Wade has suggested are very interesting. Though it may be different for each person in the group depending on how they gained their immortality. Some could have their immortality provided by a higher being while others may have made sacrifices to get there and those who were granted it may get off fairly scotfree in terms of asking for penance and forgiveness for squandering your gift while others may require a more grizzly method to appease this immortality.,FraggedEmpire,d71cotk,1,t5_32pwq

9903996,0,t3_5h0ok8,Once youre intimate with character creation you can actually brew a level one character pretty damn fast. What skills define them? What sort of equipment do they use? What trait or physical attribute is obvious for them? Fill in stats to fit in with trait and weapon choices remember to point out to them that stats are just for traits and combat. A dumb character can still be the team scientist.These questions should hammer out a sheet super fast and then just let them play fast and loose with retroing the character for the first few sessions theyre involved in as they figure out what they might enjoy or come across traitsweapon mods they think are cool.,FraggedEmpire,dayiihr,1,t5_32pwq
