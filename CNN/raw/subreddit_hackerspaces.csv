Its okay to address assault in one space and not fix it everywhere. If I could do that I would be a hero. Also you assume I havent done those things.Just because she could be potentially harassed elsewhere doesnt negate fixing in another. She could be harassed everywhere and if I can reduce the stigma on the topic even being broached then I think thats positive.,hackerspaces,cf055c7,6,t5_2r1uv

Everyone out there should absolutely get help understanding what can happen with your lease.  Getting kicked out onto the streets is about the worst thing that can happen to a hackerspace.Good luck with your moves guys.,hackerspaces,clnp36q,3,t5_2r1uv
