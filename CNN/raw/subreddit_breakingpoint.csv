1132881,0,t1_chx16mu,Loot isnt everything and belive me if you knew where to look for youll have more guns and vehicles than you can ever use. When you say punished for killing you are wrong you just probably killed a guy from your own faction or allied faction loosing points aint a punishment its a way to balance the fact that if you kill bad guys you GET points a level up. Now about the devs my experience is they DO care about the people playing the mod and they DO listen to what people says on the forum and they are AVAILABLE anytime on TS  remember that they also do that completly for free and Im not talking  paywin donation special perks or server admin privilege no FREE.As for Epoch its not out yet and basicly the communication of the current progress of the mod is resumed to a female character repeating BASEBASEBASEBUILDINGzOMG.

1207858,0,t3_27xast,Having a  days old character just means you either take breaks OR you have a good stable computer rig.

3289474,0,t1_cp2glhq,yeah i understand what restarts are for sir... i also have no noticed any bad lag near the end of the  hours.  im guessing that is probably much worse if you play on servers with  people on them since much more items and zombies will be spawned in by that time i generally stick to lower pop servers than that since seeing people often doesnt feel like a zombie apocalypse to me. maybe they should make some servers with lower population caps that do not restart as often so we can have some nights to play in!,breakingpoint,cp385ti,0,t5_2vv1v

4338243,0,t3_3aob57,According to the wiki its  seconds no matter what. gt From now on when you logout your Character will remain in the world for  seconds. This will happen no matter if logout in combat mode or not.gtIf you dont logout in a safe place its possible for your character to be killed by players or zombies. This will result in your real character being killed.If you log back in while your character is still in the world you will get a login error and will have to try again in a few minutes.gtLooting of the AI character is disabled to stop duplication. You can only loot the character after its dead.gtThis new system is much better then the previous combat logging system because it stops random character death with Arma  crashes and internet timeouts.,breakingpoint,csenec2,3,t5_2vv1v
4386951,0,t3_3b965j,Since you rebinded F you seem to have a problem. As far as I know thats the default key to switch between firemodes. To get to melee you go through e.g Single shotfull automelee. When you get to melee you use it the same way youd do it if you were trying to fire your gun. So what youve got to do is to find the place where you change firemode and bind it to something.,breakingpoint,csk59iw,2,t5_2vv1v
