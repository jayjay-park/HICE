1033960,0,t1_chl3cxn,Thank you so much. Would u advise going to omega and getting and official strap and replacing the glass. It has a lot of scratches and I feel like my father would like to see it in original condition.  And also how much would you think it would take.,watch,chltdy1,1,t5_2r3z6
2259916,0,t1_clr1buz,Im really not sure. Theyre a new company and only have that one watch so yeah. You dont have that time tested reliability you would find in a Seiko or something. Ive heard good things about them though. Theres gotta be a discussion about them somewhere on here or another watch forum. ,watch,clr1oof,1,t5_2r3z6
