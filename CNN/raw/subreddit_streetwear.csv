1622937,0,t3_2cwfxk,Why is selling out such a terrible thing tho? If I had the chance to double my profits just by offering my clothes to stores I would definitely do that. Selling out is gaining success off a great product and then allowing your designs go to shit because you have wealth and feel like you dont need to do shit anymore imo.And I think Supreme is a perfect example of the fine balance. They continue to grow with very limited promotion and basically rely on word of mouth their mailing list amp sites like hypebeast to spread the word. They can collab with Nike amp Vans and not be accused of selling out because they generate numbers that are undeniable. They can put out high priced pieces without being accused of being greedy because for every expensive item they put out a bunch of cheaper priced tees amp accessories. Theyre basically the gold standard for how to do streetwear correctly,streetwear,cjjqjgl,10,t5_2sgoq

1660157,0,t3_2dd68o,I use Pinterest it lets you add pins which are links that show up as images with a description to boards that you can create for example I have a board for tees a board for jackets a board for inspiration.. anything you can think of. You can repin from other people or add your own. Chrome has a browser extension that lets you pin pages and images and a lot of websites have a pinit button. You can follow other people on it too for example Hype beast the Illest.. etc.See something you want on karma loop? Pin it. See something that you find inspiring on Tumblr? pin it. Think your picture of your new Nikes is good? pin it.It may not be perfect but I became addicted to it very quickly.

2929428,0,t1_cnyq5z3,Hey reading this got me sort of interested in this. Did some googling and apparently whats causing this is the sole of the shoe oxidizing. So your shoes are basically rusting not really but its a similar process and theres several ways of accelerating that process. Oxygen is the main thing thats yellowing your soles oxidizing agent normally as its always available in the air. A common oxidizing agent is Hydrogen peroxide hair bleach which should yellow your soles easily. Id get some hair bleach and try it out on a spot the bottom of the sole first just to make sure youre not ruining your kicks. If it works fine take a cotton swab or toothbrush and spread the bleach evenly around your sole and wrap it with some saran. You can even leave this out in the sun as the UV rays will make the process work faster.EDIT Make sure to do this outside and wear rubber gloves. I want you to be safe around any chemicals even if its just simple hair bleach. ,streetwear,co135xj,2,t5_2sgoq

3147540,0,t1_conp67l,I feel like your designs are amazing because of how fresh and new they are but at the same time theyre sort of cheapened by the fact that the hat itself is just a regular old snapback at least thats what it looks like. If you started selling some strapbacks panels made with higher quality materials like leather as some others mentioned or wool Norse projects makes some nice wool  and  panels for inspo I would definitely buy some and be fine paying for the higher price. In the end though you just have to experiment. Take my advice take other peoples advice but take them with a grain of salt this is your clothing brand so you should design them in the way that you see fit.EDIT sorry if what I wrote was a bit jumbled Im hungover now but when I get home Ill try to make it a bit more coherent.,streetwear,coo8mh0,1,t5_2sgoq

I own a pair of UA Retro Jordan s DB. I paid  for them. They look exactly the same as the real pair that has a resale value of .

3962176,0,t3_35ukjr,Outlier great for the sun and will last you years. Heres the description Were always looking for a better way at Outlier and sometimes that means tearing a classic product apart and rebuilding it phoenixlike from the ashes. Weve been building off of a core idea for years now  that the perfect pair of shorts are tailored like a dress pant to look great built using performance fabrics so you can run or train in them and can double as a swim trunk with waterready details. With the  edition of the New Way Shorts weve refined the cut and fit to take another step toward to that perfection.The idea is you only really need to own one pair of shorts. They need to look right with a proper waistband and working fly both for function and to prevent those oversharing gym short type visuals!. They need to have proper pockets two deep front pockets and two rear welt ones as well. They need to be lightweight and breezy but with enough structure to look good and durable enough to take hiking. They need to dry quickly so you can take them anywhere and stay comfortable. And perhaps most importantly they need waterready details so when you reach some beautiful water you can dive right in. That means flow through pockets so you dont get bogged down and a drawstring waist so your shorts stay up when it counts.As with all Outlier products every material is considered from the American made T thread on up. We started with the body fabric. It needed to be light and comfortable all summer long yet strong and structured enough to take a beating and still look great. It needed to feel good move well and dry quickly too. We found the answer being woven in Sweden. The gsm F. Cloth is built around air texturized Cordura grade nylon yarns with a substantive twoway stretch. Its finished with a durable water repellant treatment so it dries quicker and stays clean longer. We paired it with a lightweight gsm American pocketing made out of similar but much finer air texturized nylon yarns.For the waistband we used a true milspec American made paracord. The mesh in the flow through pockets is similarly American made and milspec. The slot button is custom made in Italy out of Mombasa poly attached with webbing made in Pennsylvania. Finally the YKK coil zippers are made down in Georgia.When it all adds up what youve got is a better short. A short that lets you do more and own less.

I was really weary at first because of the shitfest cash grab that Pyrex Vision was fortunately OffWhite isnt one margins are too high but its very well made.  The quality is there and while I dont love everything or even the majority of things some of the pieces are really unique and cool.  I still think retail is insane but if you like a piece or two Id highly recommend keeping your eyes peeled for the seasonal sales that will start soon.  You can also save some money by taking advantage of the euro still being down and buy from retailers that will fudge the import papers to avoid duties OkiNi and Tres Bien are the big ones.,streetwear,crbshux,2,t5_2sgoq

Getting them tapered by a tailor means the fit is custom they will fit perfectly. With form fitting hems at the bottom of the legs your cuffs will stay crisp like OPs.,streetwear,csdc12f,6,t5_2sgoq

Good materials courtesy of Rei.  Can agree with apc though good quality but a few anomalies here and there. Disappointing to see most of their stuff isnt made in France  rather in Eastern Europe.

4757078,0,t3_3g24el,For them to claim that its fake they would have to provide significant evidence from a third unbiased party proving they are fake. If youre worried about that I suggest you take extremely detailed pictures of your shoes with s take a picture of the toe box the heel all stitching the sole the insole front and back the tongue the laces the box every single thing you can think of so that if that does happen you have every single reason that without a doubt the shoes you sent were real. Browse rrepsneakers to learn the ins and outs of what to look for for replica s. Theyre not hard to spot but theyre not necessarily easy either. My suggestion would be to take both insoles of the shoes and mark in a small fashion a symbol that only you will recognize. Takes pictures of that document that marking so that if he sends a fake back without that marking thats more proof. Use PayPal obviously be thorough with your terms and conditions be eager to answer any questions and put your contact info in the terms and conditions on your invoice. Send yourself copies of every single conversation that youve had with the buyer and save them in a folder. Dont delete it until youre sure the transaction is  done and you dont have to worry about the switcharoo. Id say  months at the least wait time.,streetwear,ctu6bct,1,t5_2sgoq

And I dont mean gain weight everywhere  specifically in the tummy face and thighs whilst wasting away all the muscle in my forearms and shinscalves. Look up Cushingoid appearance or Cushing syndrome if you ever want some idea as to how Im proportioned.Anyhow sorry for the life story.

4923599,0,t3_3i8s4v,Ill try to give honest feedback since youre just getting flamed. Most people here hate joggers due to the mainstream attention cuz theyre dirty goddamn hipsters. Joggers arent bad but denim prints are cheesy.                     If you do insist on wearing joggers black or grey are much better.   The top half of the fit just looks heavier than the bottom. Youve got two layered shirts and joggers with canvas shoes. I would like this a lot more with jeans personally or just one tee.                                The cuffs on the sleeves are unnecessary as well imo. Most people who wear janoskis are mall walkers so youll get some hate for being basic but those arent bad shoes. Kinda funny how janoskis are shit tier and meme his are rstreetwear essentials.                             I personally like the shirt but people here will shit on it because its a trend that died a while ago. Kanji text is really only cheesy on the back or on the sleeves so I have no issue with the shirt. If you had just posted this in the WDYWT then you would have probably not gotten flamed so much and maybe some better feedback oh well.,streetwear,cuf5phj,15,t5_2sgoq

From fires a mile from their house to dust storms Ive only been able to get in about half the time to run basic operations. However this is news to me that our contact form is down.

Then for tops solid color tees from Uniqlo whitegrayblackolive Uniqlo also has pretty nice flannels every colorway of their buffalo check pattern looks nice imo. And some hoodiescrewnecks again in the same basic colors grayblackolive you could throw in a tan or something.If you want jackets a black or olive bomber is nice to start with. Thats a basic wardrobe white shoes  black jeans with alternating topslayers. You can add in colorful or unique pieces now.,streetwear,cuqow0l,2,t5_2sgoq

Shipping for  shirts will cost us  and  for insurance for the shirts so if we get over or under that it could vary slightly. We need at least  people to participate or the shipping costs will be too high for us to order from him. Everyone will be paying for their shirts that they order along with part of the shipping cost and the shipping cost to get the shirt from me to you. You can order as many shirts as you would like I will have to make sure he has enough of each at the end of the process before I put in the order. Everything will be done securely through paypal so if it falls through youll get your money back. I wont be taking payments until I figure out how many shirts were ordering and the final cost of everything per person.If you guys have any more questions feel free to ask me ,streetwear,cv661qn,3,t5_2sgoq

Again if you get why someone would want something UNIQUE and pay for Supreme vs. Obey you can also understand why someone might want something GOOD or EXCLUSIVE. This flannel is made of wool and has a unique construction and pattern a Uniqlo one will be shitty cotton. And to enough people  is worth it.I find it really funny that youd understand why people gravitate to an upmarket small brand like Supreme but dont see how people go to luxury brands sold in much more respected stores like SaksNeimanNordstromBerdorf or boutiques about the same size as Supreme.,streetwear,cvsxq93,6,t5_2sgoq

5470503,0,t3_3pzxoz,Okay bro first off congratulations on loosing the weight! Second off congratulations on having an interest in dressing better.Like you said youre going to want to get cheap things until you get to your target weight. My suggestion is going for the cheapest of basics for tshirts right now. Order various color hanes tshirts long sleeve and short sleeve from walmart.com and hanes.com they have all kinds of basic colors that are all usually nice. They also have your size instock most of the time. My recomendation on colors are your basic blacks whites and greys then work your way up after that.For button ups you might want to check out old navygap for cheapish basic button upsyour best bet for good looking denim is to buy cheap denim that fits your waist and thighs then taking them to a tailor to get them tailored. a good tailor will be anywhere from   . My recomendation is hollister denim because they have a sale thats been going on since the summer for  a pair. Very nice for only As for shorts you could look into sweatshorts they look nice and would look good on a bigger guy. My advice for the cheapest okay quality ones are to order hanes sweat pants from walmarthanes and cut them into sweat shorts.Your shoe game is lacking tbh. The red nike ones arent really streetwear esque. BUt you could make them work if you try hard enough. For an all white shoe id reccomend all white sk his as they are cheap all white afs are classic af though so you might want to look into those. It would also do you good to get a basic black and white shoe. You might look into classic whiteblack superstars or blackwhite sk his there are tons of other options to chose from though.For dope windbreakersjackets youll want to go to the thrift store for cheap classic ones i always find the dopest jackets in your size and it lowkey makes me jealousAs for formal weardates you might want to go to rmalefashionadvice.When you get yo your target weight you might want to focus on higher quality basics and then start on buy graphics and the like.I hope i helped you. Good luck on loosing the rest of that weight feel free to pm me or just comment if you have more questionsneed help,streetwear,cwawpjv,5,t5_2sgoq

5785955,0,t1_cxe9vlf,It is true that visuals are important. Thats why we have  videos not including the logo itself  on our Kickstarter campaign.  If you are referring to the website youll find more videos when visiting the CHANNEL page.  Regardless we agree with you that there isnt enough content which is why we started the campaign to help us get the equipment and means necessary to provide those things youve also mentioned.As per your question would you want to wear a tshirt with the name of someone you dont know...  We much like yourself wear what we believe. ZAH FITTED is short for ZONE AND HUSTLE FITTED. In short its a slogan and motto that represents those of us who choose to focus and act in order to actualize our objectives. The logo or design as you mentioned actually does have a meaning. Together the shapes solidify the belief that focus and action are the foundation of success. The geometric forms and angles symbolize the ingenuity necessary for dreamers to actualize their desires.Over the last  months we have done multiple focus groups and initially had  different versions of the logo you see now. The one that was favored by hundreds of participants worldwide was this logo that you see.Thank you for sharing your feedback though we have not earned your vote today we hope to in future as you witness our development.RegardsEmmanuel,streetwear,cxeawxw,1,t5_2sgoq

6165334,0,t1_cyqecbw,one thing I am good at is project management. I would put in place contingencies for the fuck ups. Money wouldnt be accepted until we had nailed a design get early quotes then finally accept money once we were looking for production proofs. Biggest downside to this is buyers wouldnt see a product for possibly  weeks. But I wouldnt want to make this any more than . We could make nice material clothing not some gildan printwear bullshit by cutting a lot of overhead and ultimately not marking up for profit. Again Im not looking to make money on this.EDIT I dont know if that answers your questions I dont think I have all those answers yet. But on a highlevel this wouldnt be executed until planning was perfect af. ,streetwear,cyqfo6m,2,t5_2sgoq
6165407,0,t1_cyqfqrw,yes thats exactly my idea. I would  transparent about the entire process. although itd be impossible to get EXACT costs Id include a contingency cost on each unit maybe  to cover any hiccups. But if that contingency cost wasnt used Id do anything other than put it in my own bank account. It could even help fund the next round if this were successful. ,streetwear,cyqfywa,2,t5_2sgoq

6167661,0,t1_cyqolk3,You could also just wear the white tee with the blue jeans. Also the blue jeans have to be light blue nothing dark. Since the Red Octobers are very loud I suggest wearing background tone clothes that match it. Never wear it with joggers horrible imo. You can also do light blue jeans white shirt and a denim jacketblack leather jacket. You can also try tailored camo cargos with them. This is harder cause youre going to be looking for a more suitable upper body look that isnt too glaringly loud or too soft and obscure from the aesthetic. ,streetwear,cyqp6b4,2,t5_2sgoq

6197714,0,t1_cyu2kb0,Yea man for the last maybe  months all my purchases have been in consideration of quality hence the archilles low and i got a designer pair of ankle boots which despite the pricetag was complimented on about them family said they were really fucking good looking and my mums bf who owns a laundromat in a high end area remarked on the quality of the shoes though id expected family to ridicule me. Other than that I made purchases from Carhartt sweater and jacket Acne ace cash Profound crewneck jacket and some basics crew is really nice Cav Empt longsleeve. But onto what you should do I think you should look into going into some different shades than just solid blacks or whites. Or go into the family of neutralmuted colours which work well with existing minimalisticmonochromatic fashion by adding a touch of colour without seeming absurd. Otherwise if you really want to stay true to monochrome shades look into designers whether they be local or high end and get into some interesting cutssilhouettes. I think the general direction of minimalist fashion atm is going for cropped black pants  drapey black shirtsmuted coloured crewnecks. Have a look at pinterest or tumblr for some inspo. Furthermore I think a great thing about minimalist fashion is the use of shoes patterns and layered shirts to make the outfit. What I mean by this is theyll wear shoes like... white raf simons velcros which will add a bit of a futuristic and clean look while keeping true to the monochrome style. Or wearing a black and white pokadot shirt under the sweater and thus have the cuffs pop out of the sweater just like how it would when wearing a suit jacket thus giving some nice detail texture etc. Patterns can be either on the pants shirt sweater or actually in the sweater as how itd be constructed i.eHeres some inspo ,streetwear,cyu441f,1,t5_2sgoq

Bragging about how much money you spent to have that logo pasted on a simple shirt sweater etc. Its okay to buy from brands like supreme and stuff but dont act like youre a fashion God just because you can drop  dollars on a tshirt. For example I recently copped a cdg play tshirt with just the heart logo patch on the top left of the shirt. I bought it because the logo seems really awesome. I really cant justify the purchase other than I like the logo and thats what matters. If you like it. Although I would probably never buy another cdg play piece I like to know the fact that I got a piece where I really love the logo and I got satisfied from just that one piece. ,streetwear,cz1eaps,2,t5_2sgoq

They are something different its an aesthetic that doesnt suit everyone i feel like you need to not be skinny to really make them work but with fashion in general some pieces just work with certain body types.Ill confess that if they werent yeezys i probably wouldnt have looked twice im pretty sure that goes for  of people here too but im glad they were cos theyre easily my favourite yeezy to be released so far they are so comfy warm and they look dope as fuck with skinnies and a oversized hoodie or layered up for a rainy cold ass day.,streetwear,czhxmts,20,t5_2sgoq

There is no continuity between the two patterns.And yeah its very tacky. Keeping tags on the clothes they came with is considered tacky.

6601729,0,t1_d0258da,Yeah dont wear joggers with this. Joggers are much more fit for running shoes or basketball shoes. Think of more a casual athletic look like the adidas tubular series. Skate shoes are a bit more rugged and tough because of their texture and style. So wearing them in combination makes for poor continuity of an outfit. Are you going for a skate? Or are you relaxing at home? See what I mean?So yeah you can wear dark jeans or lightwash blue jeans. Either would work. However I wouldnt pin roll them unless you have skinny jeans. Pinrolling regular or even slim jeans often leads to a muddled roll that just looks sloppy and unappealing. ,streetwear,d0268sa,2,t5_2sgoq

Sneakers would be a better choice than chelsea boots because of their sportswear look but the top half also just has too much going on.Swap the boots for sneakers and go for a greyblackwhite shirt instead or pick one of your two shirts and lose the jacket.Or swap the pants for jeans and pick one shirtEDIT If you really wanted to you could get away with the layered shirts but youd probably want to swap the jacket for a bomber and the shoes for sneakers,streetwear,d07repg,1,t5_2sgoq

What you seem to get that many other streetwear startups dont is having a sense of identity and incorporating it into every single part of your merchandise and identity. Youre doing a great job storytelling with your product which takes creativity and imo the most important piece of the puzzle besides knowing the right ppl. If you look at all of the brands that achieve longterm success its what they have in common.  of the brands that have popped up the past few years jumping on trends wont be around for too long. They have no identity and all they offer is a cheaper alternative to whatever high fashion designer they are biting that month. Keep it up dude!,streetwear,d0nw5ia,6,t5_2sgoq

In my  years ive never heard cheese colored to describe those and Im a new yorker.The sfb by nike hasnt blown up as a fashion trend its a trend in newstreetwear. Which is heavily cycled by the internet and typically is an item that is either worn ironically or worn because of the fact that it opposes mainstream enough to warrant counter culture people wearing them.athleisure is still a thing in fashion. so the sneakers are fine If not biased and missing a few. And keep in mind kanyes shoes are more wow those people spend a lot on shoes to the average consumer than anything. and currently are going by the wind in kanyes sails. Streetwear hype is on a downtrend otherwise due to oversaturation and too many limited releases. notice jordans arent nearly as in your face as in  or  by the same measure kanye has gone back on statements such as not rereleasing colorways and releasing a shoe in like  colors so farNeed a bit more research because youve chosen unbranded and unnamed formal wear.

Some big brands are really bad bad culture bad hours no direction while others like Nike and Burberry are really good to work for. So it largely depends. Go on Glassdoor.com create an account and you can read what its like from some of the reviews. Just note complaints are more common than positive reviews especially since people like to vent ifwhen they get laid off or fired etc... ,streetwear,d1d9lm3,3,t5_2sgoq

Which is also where I got the idea for the logo. let me know what you guys think and if you love it I have both a facebook page and Instagram page for it Id love if you guys followed to keep up to date.

7126619,0,t1_d1nthfj,This is how most brands started out. If you ever tried it youd understand that starting one on a borrowed money is a dumb idea cause of the huge amount of competition in the market and huge failure rate. Selling prints is a quick way to get brand recognition and a constant flow of cash coming in so youre able to do more further down the line. Cut and sew is ridiculously expensive sourcing materials finding a pattern cutter getting your samples cut recut then redone just so they fit perfectly isnt viable for most startups. Youre expecting too much from people who are testing the waters. Just a logo on a tee I could be angry at cause theres no imagination but everyone has to start somewhere.The recent mix of high fashion and streetwear has got some of you fucked up lol. Not everyone has access to huge amounts of capital and resources and until they do theyre gonna do what they can. Telling them to either do it properly or not do it at all is dumb. Look what Represent started with and their pieces now.,streetwear,d1o7qx0,37,t5_2sgoq

7128631,0,t3_4d6jiy,I wanna thank you for posting this on this board in particular. To me its super important to show the broad spectrum of young brands and I highly appreciate that youre going your own way and steering clear of hype clichs currently visible in the streetwear scene.Successful brands follow their own vision and create trends they dont follow them. Youre definitely on the right track here.For some reason your photography reminds me of Josh Reims lookbooks  look him up I think youll find some inspiration. I totally understand the harshly lit obviously kitschy studio mood its great.Cool idea with one theme per collection so to speak. Right now its a bit narrow it seems like its just Vietnam patches but I can totally see how youre gonna look into more complex visual languages and themes and roll them out to clothes. Remember the Kodakbranded clothing Opening Ceremony made? Your collections visual language is just as narrow as OCs but youll get there.Congratulations man!,streetwear,d1og0wv,1,t5_2sgoq

7277606,0,t1_d25e8m4,thanks for your honest opinion! I must agree I have posted her  times now because Im trying to get the name logo and so on to perfection. The name is ancient greek inspired and these designs are just almost samples to see where we can go with this brand and obviously cant just go straight into ancient greek inspired clothing right away  you can see we started quite unbalanced and it may look odd to you and I completely understand. We are currently in the process of producing cut and sew clothing which are unique and have some relevance to our brand. Your opinion on the logo is  relevant and if you feel that way thank you we take it on board definitely. However I believe this reception is evidently better and possibly better than our other ideas. To be honest Reddit is just being used as sort of a platform just to gain ideas to improve our start up brand so sorry if the few times we posted about our brand annoyed you.Have a good day.,streetwear,d25eyk6,46,t5_2sgoq

7284726,0,t3_4f4hh9,Nope. I been working in the fashion industry for the past several years and I love it. If youre talking about buying into the hype of fashion and feeling bad about it then I would say I dont partake. As Ive always said fashion is just a tool style is what you do with the tools. Now I certainly cant stand when people feel the need to look like each other because in that there is no self expression except wanting to be part of a group. I actually get kind of perturbed when people say they are passionate about fashion yet dont even attempt to try different styles. Like I know many kids who wouldnt dare touch a tailored suit because they think they cant pull it off or its not their style or some other bs... Thats the type of shit that makes me fell bad about being in fashion the countless people who shun other types of fashion yet desire to be in the same group as people who are constantly reinventing their style through exploration and discovery. So no. I dont feel bad about being in fashion. I do feel bad about the hype but what the hell can I do to stop it. ,streetwear,d2683f4,1,t5_2sgoq

Some people will just assume theyre real no matter how bad the fakes ie a celebrity wearing reps.

Sometimes you gotta take whats best for you into consideration if the relationship has been more down than up for a while it may be time to reevaluate. You will be okay though man i promise. Regardless of the outcome life has a funny way of moving forward.

7624108,0,t3_4jop4a,FW and FW were two of Goshas best collections. You can see his progression in ideas between the two seasons. In  his collection was BARELY inspired by anything Russian related. Gosha was into gem and earth tones and less so the history or culture of Russia. Then in  when his name started getting more big he went all out on his collection. The big logo SPORT scarves are evidently inspired by football soccer team scarves. The big logo Gosha tee is inspire by Tommy Hilfiger. The sweatsuit is inspired by ss Russian gym uniforms including the long neck part. I also feel like a lot of his outerwear is inspired by what many Russians wore outside in the cold winters of the USSR except that Gosha loves to add a lot of detail into his stuff and chose to do so. FW is okay but it is not as good as his previous stuff. FW embarks on a lot of Eastern Orthodox Church material but is overall part of a long stretch of Russin history and heritage. My personal favorite Gosha pieces are Rassvet Tee in PurpleTeal DSM release Denim coat with pale green camo SS ? and the Gosha M Old Skools SS .EDIT wrong season on Gosha old Skools ,streetwear,d38tjp2,7,t5_2sgoq

The striped tee is actually our most popular product but it is sublimation but the place we get it from gets the line up perfectly and weve only had one case where there was a problem with the armpit. And since its our most ordered product with only one complaint it doesnt seem too bad. Also we just took product shots of most of our products and will have them up either tonight or tomorrow.Thanks for voicing your concern and I hope I answered all your questions and responded to all your concerns,streetwear,d3ts2qt,1,t5_2sgoq

Im aware of the atrocities that the Nazis did in WW and I do not condone nor do I support what they did this is a strictly aesthetic choice and one I did out of my own creative liberty and freedom to make a jacket the way I wanted it to look.gtIll keep in mind to not wear it out to any strongly Jewish areas or if I ever go overseas to any Jewish countries.This is how you sound.,streetwear,d3yu438,55,t5_2sgoq

I like a lot of edgier fashion ripped jeans leather jackets etc so I own a lot of those too. And I really really like sneakers because my feet like being comfy.

Plus its not as powerful a gesture. anyone can get a summer job  it doesnt require college education or parental support.

8574247,0,t3_4x39pz,A lot of the pieces have built in margins that correlate with the production advertising storage and profit of each unit. Not the advertising on an adidas shoe may be  of price but they still have their giant logo on it so that also adds advertising value. When you remove the logo you remove that value which is compensated for by increasing the advertising percentage. Adidas understands people may not know youre wearing their piece and recoups some of that potential product loss in initial price. In the end its how you like the piece. I pay for quality usually but non brand also is a factor. Common Projects are a great example IMO. ,streetwear,d6dd3dh,1,t5_2sgoq

When I left at  the people at the end of the line were easily looking at  hour waits. Dunno if its calmed down but the line was actually growing faster than it was shrinking once they started taking people in. As long as you get there like  hours before close youll be good. If you miss it and they close while youre in line I believe you can come the next morning and retain your spot I think I heard some staff saying.

As ufashonablylate said itd look stupid if some dorky  yo showed up to clarinet practice in dropcrotch shorts and geobaskets mostly because it makes no sense. You dont show up to the fucking yacht club in bape if you go to places like that. Ultimately the thing for me is to take into account my lifestyle and dress for that. Streetwear looks stupid to me when people seem to be trying to force aesthetic onto their life instead of letting the stuff they do with their time and energy define their aesthetic. Thats the same reason it looks kinda silly to me when nonskaters wear thrasher and other stuff like that.,streetwear,d6wt3wd,23,t5_2sgoq

I love that my s are made in the US but that has nothing to do with comfort.What makes the UB so comfortable is the combination of fulllength boost and primeknit. s are classic and by no means uncomfortable but its a very different shoe than the UB.

I fix that by pulling down the bottom part is that normal or should an oversized hoodie always be thinner around your body but longer to the crotch? I think I like it but I would like to get a second opinion.

My clothes dont smell of cigs really because of washing them more regularly but my jackets and coats get to a point where even I THINK they smell so they probably smell pretty bad of cigs before they get a wash. My car smells like dogs and cigarettes and I try to keep up on air fresheners and keep my windows rolled down but Im pretty used to it  its not bad in the summer but I hate it in the winter. EDIT I dont smoke in my house though  smoking inside is usually what makes people just smell like a dirty old ashtray all the time. I will smoke inside at other peoples houses if they smoke inside but I try to keep it at a minimum because it makes my hair reek. ,streetwear,d7haaeq,3,t5_2sgoq

Copenhagen is imo the place where people are in general ahead of the pack. It just takes a while for stuff to change over and nobody really knows where its going to go.

9447888,0,t1_d9cwkuq,Basically we found a Wii in a fridge in front of a thrift store by Union Square. We took some pics and then I decide to try and make some money off of it so we head off to GameStop down the block. While were walking Im asking random people if they wanna buy it but they all decline. One of the other people at the meetup suggested if GameStop doesnt give us shit then I should just smash it. We get to GameStop and ask an associate if we could trade it in or plug it in to see if it works. GameStop wouldve given us . As in .... And thats only if we had the Nunchck the Wiimote and the sensor bar along with it which wasnt in the fridge. They didnt even let us test it. So I said fuck it and went outside and smashed that shit harder than any like button Ive seen. I felt bad for the guy who said he wouldve bought it after I had already smashed it since I really wouldve given it to him. But to be fair smashing a Wii was oddly satisfying in a way so that replaces any monetary gain for me.,streetwear,d9dl3z1,1,t5_2sgoq

9523846,0,t3_5bafio,The first thing I noticed when looking at your receipt was the extremely low shipping cost lt.  Now it might just stand out to me because I always ship via USPS  day Priority Mail where shipping a tee runs  if shipped domestically within US.  In regards to your particular circumstance I have experienced something similar although I was the buyer.  The seller provided me a pic of the receipt that looked a lot like yours does no tracking remarkably low cost etc. and my package was nowhere to be seen for like a month.  It turns out that the package was being held at my local post office because the seller had not paid the true shipping cost.  The items weight was marked far below what it really was.  I had to physically go into the post office and pay the  to account for the deficit.  Once I paid they happily handed over the package.  Luckily for me the seller was willing to reimburse me for the payment without the hassle of continuing the PayPal dispute.Now keep in mind it is possible for the buyer to continue to pursue the PayPal dispute even though they eventually get the item like I did.  If theres no tracking involved whos to say they really got the package?  Yeah its messed up but you cant really stop them.EDIT  As a buyer usually you receive a notice in the mail if something addressed to you is being held at the post office.  I did not receive a single notice until it was almost too late.  One clearly marked as a final warning showed up and was what prompted me to visit the post office.  ,streetwear,d9n0kvf,3,t5_2sgoq

9667322,0,t3_5dflx1,So I stroll into my local game stop looking to buy a copy of Persona no Embremu Waifu Jam! Gaiden. I grab the game and take it to the charming maiden at the register. I say pardon me milady.... But could you ring me up? A shame I dont have your number or Id ring you up instead... She giggles and takes the game blushing as her fingers brush mine due to my fingerless gloves.Her eyes widen as she reads the games title Wow Ive never seen anyone buy this before! You must have special taste!. I smile and ready a witty response when suddenly a voice rings from behind. Hahaha look at what this faggot is buying! Thats not Call of Duty! What a piece of shit! I quickly turn around my cloak billowing behind me to discern the source of this rude outburst.Standing before me is generic dudebro caricature with a sports team cap and The guy that beat you up that one time behind the school in early October shirt just standing over the guffawing. Excuse me sir... you may disparage my person if you wish but it is untoward to swear in front of a lady.Fuck you faggot! The man replied.As you wish...I quickly swing my cane into his kneecap before he can react he bellows and charges forwards. I expertly sidestep him and the cashier screams as he crashes into the counter. I draw my swordcane and mutter a quiet oath as I drive it deep into his back....requiescat in pace...As I clean my blade the girl walks out from behind the counter twirling her hair with her fingers. So...maybe youd like to come over to my place and play that game sometime... ? the cashier asked me.No thanks milady Its single player only. Besides... I sheath my sword.Youre not my typeI skate away on my Heelys into the sunset.,streetwear,da4p7hl,51,t5_2sgoq

Third I just stated Vetements actually MAKES their own pieces start to finish. Heres a biker jacket for reference. That is a piece made by them look at how it fits use of accessories like zippers on the sleeves etc. etc. Now onto ASSC. They use a Gildan hoodie and then screenprint on it. I can actually recreate a ASSC hoodie  exactly as the ones they sold for about  by myself. I cannot go out buy that oversized biker jacket and slap on a vetements tag on the neck and get the same product. Do you understand what Im saying now.,streetwear,da5aqae,2,t5_2sgoq

9845013,0,t3_5gapos,Oh my god I dont want to sound condescending but here it goes if you want some info behind this shirt and brandVetements is a parody of high fashion its more a concept than an aesthetic. Basically its kind of taking a shit on itself similar to what marc jacob did in the s. Vetements literally means Clothes in french. The guy which I cant remember off the top of my head used to work for Margiela before moving toward vetements.Despite the hate for vetements they do create an insane amount of influence toward other street brands and hypewear by putting streetwear on the runway instead of the otherway around. For example this snoop dogg pieceThis snoop dogg shirt is a rare tour shirt from way back vetements popularized it again by putting it on a shirt. Vetements pretty much embodied all of what street wear is by pushing out this shirt and the insane amount of hype that followed it and how it trickled all the way down to zumiez.But vetements does more than that too. Some of the other pieces are super playful and eerie? The womens line mens line just came out this year actually has a sock high heel with a bic lighter attached and a high heel with brake lights on. They also have a triple layered metal shirt that still blows me away.IF youre paying for vetements you either like the hype surrounding the brand or appreciate it to that extent. I can sit down and appreciate the pictures and designs that vetements put out but Id probably never pick up anything except  but its way out of my price range.Hate it or not vetements spawns a lot of the streetwear trends from the justin beiber tour merch to kylie jenners fashion line to the metal trend and thats only one facet of their clothing line. Most people dont pay attention to the other stuff vetements pushes out like these n golden eye guys ,streetwear,daqttox,5,t5_2sgoq

9907834,0,t3_5hbho5, Things I would recommend.  Top shirt is a plain white tee. I would suggest you try a darker top layer shirt. As this personally just looks like you wearing your inner shirt on the outside on some old school super hero kick. The sleeves I suggest you wear a long sleeve shirt on your top layer as it gives a better look and the wide openings on the sleeves wont throw off the rest of the look. Im pretty sure I can actually see the black under the white tee yeah would definitely recommend you pick a different top shirt. ,streetwear,daz0ix2,1,t5_2sgoq

9922486,0,t3_5hkepg,If you need warm basics check out Reigning Champ their heavyweight stuff is warm as fuck. Fitwise it all depends on your body type theres better but their stuff is comfortable and warm. I just wear their sweatshirt without a jacket with like CF and Im not even cold. Its made in canada. Also worth mentioning their customer support is the best Ive ever experienced in any company ever. My package was lost and on top of that I had to pay import duties so they refund me the shipping fees and import duties and sent me another sweatshirt marked as a gift to avoid taxes even though the sweatshirt was soldout everywhere.John Elliott hoodies are also very clean.Depending on your style you might want to check out Nid De Guepes Acne Studios Maison Kitsun all very different but if you want to find your style you have to experiment.As for shoes personally Im really into slipons they are extremely versatile. Now its the winter though so I copped a pair of air max ultra moire. Always keep an eye on grailed you can cop good stuff for way cheaper.

Chain art schools such as The Art Institute are almost never worth it but go to a real university or noteworthy private art school FIT Parsons LCF and you will definitely have opportunities. If you work hard build an impressive portfolio talk to your professors and network you can definitely make it. My mom is a professor in fashion merchandising and design and a lot of her former students have amazing jobs for popular brands but it certainly took hard work on their part to get where they are today.  ,streetwear,db7vhhr,7,t5_2sgoq

9981835,0,t1_db8hrcq,I would look into the Venta Rivet or Gothic. Venta is one of best general all around gloves which I use regularly cycling in F weather. The L GoreTex Windstopper is phenomenal and comes with a light lining of fleeces. Very waterproof very warm for its weight and bulk.Rivet is aslo a great one. I do not own this glove but Ive owned Polartec HardFleece gloves in the past and can comment that they are the best all arounders for non intensive activities. Its air permeable unlike the Venta but has a lot more fleece than the Venta. It also has a leather palm which lends itself a nice look.Gothic is Arcs merino wool liner. Its ultralight thin sleek and have OK warmth for its size and weight. These are my gloves that I wear when I dont bike to class. I pop these gloves on and put my hands in pocket and Im toasty. These are better as glove liners IMO and what I use them as  of the time. Having a thin glove is nice but its sleek smooth finish makes me nervous handling my phone.,streetwear,db8ntjk,1,t5_2sgoq

9984539,0,t3_5ijlsw,I constantly rotate between Tom Fords Oud Wood Tobacco Vanille and Tuscan Leather I usually wear Tuscan Leather and imo fragrance is fairly significant. Its fine if you dont like wearing perfumecologne as long as you have good hygiene and smell alright but I personally like wearing fragrances as it adds a fairly unique element to your outfit  presentation in general. The goal for me when I shop for fragrances and decide how much I actually want to apply is to get to a point where the smell is strong enough that it is distinguishable at an appropriate distance and has a pleasant smell that isnt overpowering but not strong enough that it immediately hits you if say I walk into an elevator. Imo the worst thing you can do when it comes to wearing perfume  cologne is put on such a high volume that it becomes an overpowering stench. Like even if its a good scent itll still make you feel sick and want to gag if it hits you in the face like that and usually that comes off as pretty gross and something youd want to avoid Or so id think but ive seen this a lot in public and ive gotten Uber drivers who reek of whatever the fuck it is they wearAnyways in regards to designer fragrance and its correlated price I have the same outlook on it that I do on clothes. I dont really mind spending the money for it but I can see why some people do. Regardless you making it more affordable would allow more people to own such fragrances unless you mean you would attempt to replicate the fragrances in which case I think a lot of people wouldnt purchase because its a vaguely similar concept to buying replica clothing and thats often frowned upon.,streetwear,db90hzj,1,t5_2sgoq

Lead singer Liam Gallagher middle in first pic was pretty into fashion and still is. He was most known for parkas and anoraks and brands like umbro. Noel Gallagher second to left in first pic was his older brother who wrote all the lyrics and music and played guitar was less in the fashion scene but still wore some dope fits imo. Some people may think this shits basic or may not be your taste but I really thought they were some great s inspo. Hope someone enjoys lol,streetwear,dbnhle5,2,t5_2sgoq

I think what Im trying to get at is that the hand painted simple back graphic has already been done and received a ton of exposure so both these designs feel derivative of it. Which isnt to say I dont like the designs I just think if you want to make something that does well you need to be different and innovative. If you look at brands doing graphics that have made it big theyre all doing different approaches to what a graphic is and can be to a certain extent. Good design always comes from a specific perspective and concept. To me the front design is much more interesting because it seems to have more of your voice in it.,streetwear,dbou5rx,4,t5_2sgoq

This is what acts as the catalyst for everybody following the same trend and dressing the same and thats usually fairly frowned upon. Streetwear is a really broad term and like any different subgenre of fashion originality plays a part in it. You also dont need to spend a ton of money to dress well. The idea that you either need expensive shoes or something branded as yeezys is basically whats wrong with the streetwear community in one sentence right now. Basic affordable shoes like stan smiths chucks etc can work just as well as  shoes if worn correctly. To sum it up for you a hypebeast is someone that concentrates  of their efforts when shopping for clothes  dressing up in branding and prioritizes flex pieces and owning sought after brands like Bape Supreme ASSC etc regardless of the actual quality of their fit.,streetwear,dcs58hz,2,t5_2sgoq

Ive thought of it as the clothes people in cool subcultures wear you know? This sub is cool but it definitely isnt that. Its like a mix between that and MFA or something. Its kind of hard to explain. I guess Ive always associated streetwear with cool people. Most the people that I see rocking this subs aesthetic irl are lames tbh.

Other times I sleep on it for like a month before splurging and that honestly saves me a lot of money I spend the most on designer bags so I dont have to stress about buying because it will most likely not sell out.

Im not sure if its real but appearntly legit checks arent allowed here anymore so lets pretend it is.What do you guys think of my fit though? I got mixed results at school. Some said I look dumb as shit some said its dope as shit.It doesnt really matter to me I think it looks nice and somewhat different from what everyone else usually wears.If youre wondering I got my inspiration for this fit from Kanye.

10948025,0,t1_de92gfg,Its interesting that the monks would do this refusing to receive alms or eat the alms one has been offered deprives the almsgivers of the positive karma earned through the act of almsgiving. But having said that this is Myanmar were talking about where mobs of thousands of monks part of the  movement riot through Muslim villages burning them to the ground and beating Muslim men to death. According to their leader their acts of violence and murder do not result in negative karma because he interprets Sakymuni Buddhas teachings as saying that it is karmically justified for monks to use violence when the Dharma is under threat. This is a reasonable interpretation of the teachings IMO if the Dharma is under threat of extinction it is karmically justifiable to use violence against those that create the threat. The problem in the case of Myanmar and the  movement is that the large amount of Muslim immigrants and converts may mean that Buddhism will not always be the majority faith in Myanmar but this isnt equal to the Dharma being under threat of extinction since the Dharma currently flourishes across the world. The act of using violence to protect the Dharma is meant to be a seriously last ditch effort. ,streetwear,de97m6i,6,t5_2sgoq

10970142,0,t3_5wnc5d,For a more mature look I suggest like a light coloured oxford button up shirt either light blue light pink or maybe even some of the striped colourways there is a tonne to choose from and you can pick some up for a decent price from HM or somewhere similar.For bottom half I either suggest a lighter wash slimskinny fit pair of jeans or if its warmer a pair of chino shorts a stone colour would compliment an button up shirt nicely I feel.Shoes keep it simple. With the jeans I would wear a more dressier shoe like a pair of derbies or something along those lines with shorts I would suggest a pair of white Chucks because theyre a slim silhouette and fairly lightweight CP Achilles also but theyre fairly pricey. You can always experiment with other shoes and shit thought Dont forget about accessories either sunglasses are essential for summer ,streetwear,debhqso,3,t5_2sgoq

11015105,0,t1_defxv98,I personally dislike the rule since I like putting things into designated threads but I would definitely disagree that there was ever really discussion on this sub in the first place at all.Before wdywt threads were the only thing on the front page pickups with fit pics were the only things on the front page lmao.Now it just kinda feels like the stuff that usually breaks rule  doesnt make it to the front page. Stuff like dae Hampm stole this design? and look at my classmate in bape simply because posting is way more common now.So yea idk if we remove fit pics but allow pickups the front page just becomes more stagnant which means itll only be pickups and weak posts that didnt get removed that wouldnt usually make it to the front page. Moderation is much less manual now since the front page is much more affected by actual votes which is kinda nice.Honestly I think its almost impossible to have any discussion on this sub. The sub is too big and too impacted by votes to have proper discussion. If you take away fit pics then pickups come up. If you take away pickups then its just random pictures that probably break the rules. Killing one type of post is not going to CREATE more discussion type posts if we never had them in the first place yknow?That said I think this sub is a fine place to start off but if youre looking for true high level discussion then youre a doofus if you think this is the right place lol. edit quick fixes,streetwear,degj4su,10,t5_2sgoq

11086913,0,t1_deom4j9,Thanks for the reply its much nicer to just have a conversation about it and hear each others thoughts.Ill give you credit for attempt at a rebuttal but man youre still just misunderstanding what was said. These are easy things to understand and unless Im severely underestimating how well I explained it Im not sure why you dont get it.gt Your whole purpose is to use a small most likely  unknown population of a large group to argue that the hijab is not oppressive and that women choose to wear it freely.Just as you were speaking in absolutes youre now accusing me of doing the same which as Ive said over and over is not what Im doing. I have repeatedly stated that the hijab is indeed used in many parts of the world as an attempt to oppress thats a reality. However as is apparent in the mere fact that its not even a mandate in the religion its obvious it was not intended to be used in this way which is why you have great Muslim scholars and politicians arguing against its compulsion such as in the video you linked. Its clearly a cultural problem an issue of perverse interpretation and blatant misuse to further an unrelated cultural rather than religious ideal.What Im talking about in my comments is that the practice of wearing a hijab does not inherently imply oppression because that aspect of it rose due to cultural effects. You yourself recognize this so by that same token you must accept that this evolution of its use is not all encompassing. Its impossible to state that the sole universal function of the hijab is oppression and it is always worn through coercion.Just think about your rape example for a second. If there are people out there who were legitimately abused and had no choice in the pregnancy their existence is a fact right? If there are people out there who legitimately came upon the decision to wear a hijab through their own logic their existence is a fact right? Being unsure of how many of these people there are does not change the fact that they exist. Even if they are a minority you still cannot disregard them. The reason why this isnt a trivial thing as you stated is how youre statement will be perceived. Because a cultural use may have become a new majority rather than the original one the conclusion will be made that this is simply the new religious definition of the practice. It disregards the existence of the original use alongside the misinterpreted use and reinforces the idea that the practice stands for oppression nothing else.  Im not arguing how many of these people exist so me looking up statistics would be irrelevant to my point and a waste of time. This is one of the weakest attempts to refute a point forcing someone to quantify such an abstract idea and you see it all the time with people who say prove BLM isnt about blacks wanting to oppress whites or feminism isnt about equality because feminism is about female superiority over men. Im simply pointing out that they do exist just look at the countless interviews of famous advocates who explain their decision and to categorize all people who do something as being forced to do so or being oppressed when they do it is unfair and inaccurate.,streetwear,deoowxb,1,t5_2sgoq

11144366,0,t3_5z2m7n,Heres a comment I posted regarding Milan.First of all check out Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II for luxury brands. Theres also Corso Vittorio Emanuele II where you could find HampM Zara Footlocker TNF Vans etc. You can look on google maps and see which shops youd like to check out.Then theres Corso di Porta Ticinese where youll find Carhartt WIP Stussy Vans American Apparel.Another place is Via Pasquale Paoli  which is a little far but theres Antonioli there which is IMO amazing even if you dont have the money to splurge there. A few steps down theres also Slam Jam Milano.At Piazza Gae Aulenti there is a Nike Store I highly recommend checking that area out because its flat out breathtaking.In the Corso Como area theres a Y store Louboutin Dsquared Margiela Moschino Costume National if youre into that. At the Y store youll also find adidas x raf and adidas x RO.And ofc theres the Rick Owens store at Via Monte di Pieta .There is also this outlet  which a redditor made me aware of. AFAIK they carry some high end brands only SLP and Gucci come to mind right now. I havent visited it personally but you can check it out. If you have a week to spend in Milan Id recommend visiting the city on foot its worth it for the scenery alone. Get a metro card which you can use if your feet get tired.,streetwear,dev7ab3,3,t5_2sgoq

11152192,0,t3_5z8dvb,Back story here so I just got back from an audition in San Francisco for an ebay advertisement. My dad died in august of . I have had a good amount anxiety since I stopped smoking weed in january  my dad dying did not help. When I came across this sub in december  I really liked the fits the jokes the memes and especially the discussion going around. I decided I wanted to get in to photographystreetwear. So I spent two weeks looking for a camera and got the D for  with two lenses of craigslist. Ive convinced my mom to take me thrift shopping with her once a week because I dont know how to drive yet working on it. Every time I post a fit I worry about when I should post it if you guys are going to like it and a bunch more random bullshit. But its awesome being a part of the community and getting feedback whether it be good or bad. Now I go to the gym most days when I dont work Ive got a job with one of my neighbors doing construction work on the weekdays I go out most days to take photos dragging my introvert brother along and I actually went to my first audition which I was extremely anxious for.TLDR I just wanted to tell you guys how grateful I am for rstreetwear. I went from staying in my room everyday to going to work and taking photos everyday. Thank you guys.,streetwear,dew37ox,140,t5_2sgoq

At the most youll be able to find out who makes their blanks I believe you can find it if you search it up here but you wont be able to find who prints the designs or makes their cutandsew stuff.If you have to stay on this topic then might I suggest presenting the origins of some of their designs? Many of their designs are other works with the Supreme logo placed on theme like the Christmas shirt they did.,streetwear,dfev0gv,3,t5_2sgoq

For the most part expensive clothes do bring with them a higher build quality. Theyll likely last longer and hold up to repeated wear.Its also a matter of exclusivity. If people dont want to dress like everybody else one of the easiest ways to do so is to dress with clothes that others cant afford.A lot of the extremely expensive clothes are victims of economy of scale. If theyre produced in smaller batches exclusivity less mainstream demand theyre going to be more expensive.,streetwear,dg4svt0,8,t5_2sgoq

The brand focus of the sub is not my thing but Im looking at people combining colours and pieces. I wouldnt wear most of the fits here but its ok to look at clothing and deciding for yourself what you like and what not. Looking at all types of clothing helps you shape a taste and style. Blindly copying shit is always bad but that goes for any place. This sub serves as inspo a bad fit can help towards that.
