Im really hoping it turns out Hals the one who taught him sometime in the past maybe he worked for Argus as a pilot. Then in the present we see Hal and maybe get hints that hes become Green Lantern since then but we dont see him transform and thats the Hal that Barry meets. And through an inevitable crossover we see Ollie Hal and Barry hang out. Its one of the more natural ways to do it I think. ,FlashTV,cikwhc0,9,t5_2y6bs

For example you really only needed to know that Felicity is on Team Arrow to fully understand her connection to Arrow when she shows up in Central City.

2344419,0,t1_cm139cy,That seems too convoluted to me.  It would make more sense for Wells to be Reverse Flash.  Occams razor and all that.  Especially considering there is absolutely zero foreshadowing at this point for Eddie being RFlash so if he does turn out to be RFlash it would just come off as lazy writing.  Good twists are established early and they make sense based on what we know of the characters.Also I think it should be a good long while before we have a Flashpoint event.  The whole point of it was that it turned the established universe on its head.  If you do that at the end of one season in a universe where there are literally two superheroes it has zero impact.Also also Zoom cant kill Barry this early.

Also I just seen the next week trailer again RF seems to have said to Barry You arewere destined to become the Flash or some words to that effect.

3206117,0,t1_coub3wk,Definitely I agree with your points. The ndth episodes are a weak point of the show but even at its weakest it is still above mediocre. Even when the show didnt lend itself well to the basic plot structure of those episodes it still had solid writing between characters to drive it forward. I love how the recent comic book movie renaissance has bled into television. Arrow Flash Shield Constantine Gotham they all bring something different and I love each of them. Its such a good time to be a fan of these characters. I never thought in a million years that Id sit and chat about John Constantine and Jim Corrigan and Zed or Gorilla Grodd and Caitlyn Snow or whomever with people who have never picked up a comic book in their life. Its a great feeling! People actually WANT to learn more about the characters.

3207994,0,t3_2wsax3,The Rogues will likely act as recurring villains throughout many of the shows planned story arcs and I doubt that the Grodd subplot will be explored in detail until season two. We also have no idea what will happen to Wells in the finale of season one  sure he could get imprisoned or killed which would effectively remove his character from further usage but there is a very high chance that he might evade capture and escape from the team. In the comics several individuals had the title of Reverse Flash and it isnt unthinkable that the producers might choose to have someone else take up the villains mantle later in the shows plot. ,FlashTV,couia3d,4,t5_2y6bs

Barry realizing what he has done dresses as the Reverse Flash and goes back in time in order to kill his own mother if he didnt dress like that Barry who was already there would have reacted in a different way causing another time boom. This means that thr Flash and the Reverse Flash who were in Noras house were the same person all along. Barry fixes the timeline but another Barry from a far future realizes the paradox and decides to stop both of them from being there hoping to negate the effect the presence of three speedsters in the same universe consumes a lot of Speedforce and the universe is about to end. Wells realizes whats going on and goes back in time builds a particle accellerator meant to explode in order to give Barry and himself powers and he makes sure Barry goes back in time once and fails against the Reverse Flash. However the Reverse Flash who killed Nora was Barry so Wells decides to dress as the Reverse Flash to convince Barry it was him who did it.

3221067,0,t1_covuyxj,gt Again Im not saying hes a popular villain or some great villain that should appreciate more.No one is saying you said that or implied that. gt Im merely contesting your statement that he is a stupid idea for a villain which you havent even attempted to back up in all your subsequent posts.Im simply trying to find what criteria you have for a decent villain before I continue. I think popularity would be a decent enough indicator for most people and as Ive said before the villain seems to have no redeeming qualities.gt He has had some interesting storylines over the last couple decades that depict him as a washed up villain trying to prove himself which is not something often seen in a medium that hesitates to age its characters.So to me this makes him slightly better than worthless because I could see how that would make him at least a plausible side character.

3422338,0,t1_cpht0ly,With Convergence bringing the Multiverse back including hypertime versions of Prenew I think the only reasonable assumption is that this Prof Zoom will be some Hypertimeversion of the Prenew one...Probably not the Flashpoint one since he died.  But that one couldve came from anywhere in the timestream.  This one could have came from a different point in prenews timestream.Hypertime  A simple explanation of Hypertime is that time is malleable like a stream.  the water will be disrupted if you throw a rock in it but farther down the stream it ends up the same.  It kinda excuses continuity errors.  A good example is in the JL cartoon when time alters Green Lantern John Stewart changes into Green Lantern Hal Jordan but Hal already knows whats going on so they dont have to catch him up... then later he changes back and it keeps going.  It also allows for an infinite  of universes because each universe has an infinite number of variations possible in their timeline.,FlashTV,cpiddzo,1,t5_2y6bs

3423164,0,t1_cpigcd1,my brain hurts trying to think of an answer lolSo ok we have  Barry in the pilot going back to save his mom. and his little self so  BarrysNow we have current Barry going back in time for  day and retaining his memories. His body is still the same body from right before he traveled back. The  day earlier Barry we first saw  is now in his own seperate timeline and currently now  day ahead of the now newly traveled back in time by  day Barry which is going through all the events that  we will see next week on  from the currently traveled back by  day Barry. Technically there could now be  older Barrys that weve seen. But it would make it simpler to just say there is  Barry. The Barry we are always watching in its current timeline. I dont think we will reach the point of showing  Barrys in  timeline .ex Barry hiding from himself so he doesnt damage the timeline etc. Think of the first barry like hes now in his own seperate timeline while the newly traveled back in time barry is the only Barry we will see except only when he taps into the speedforce and sees different timelines of himself tapping into the speedforce,FlashTV,cpigs57,3,t5_2y6bs

Because of this change the futureas told by Gideon is even worse from Wells point of view than in timeline .  So he starts his quest to restore timeline  by creating the flash training him molding him.Interestingly enough Barry does go back to the night in timeline  confronts the the RF but he must still kill Nora for timeline  to stay intact.,FlashTV,cpqgnd5,1,t5_2y6bs

3502605,0,t1_cprgtk1,gt Barry went down th St. for a while but then he turned around went back to intersection and continued down Season Ave. Past Barry is on th St. and Current Barry is on Season Ave.This is not how timetravel works in any written media and time is more like a river. It is everywhere not just at certain specific points. Barry exists on all branches all the time except when there is a reason not to. No matter when Barry travels to the intersection and goes to the other branch other Barry is there because he exists continuously on that branch.Ill use the analogy you provided to make you understand. There is a single road time. Barry exists on the road at not one point but on all of them when he exists. Barry travels on the road as usual. At one point which I call now breaking point meets another Flash and stops in a VERY SPECIFIC PLACE. Continues going on the road until the Tsunami happens when he turns back to the breaking point. But since he is EVERYWHERE on the road it is not possible to not meet himself on the road. Which he did. Twice. Confused he stops at the exactly same TIME and PLACE where he already stopped once. Therefor Past Barry Allen should meet Future Barry Allen. Alternate timeline is created when he is travelled back to the breaking point however the creation of the alternate timeline DOES NOT explain the disapperance of Past Barry Allen who WAS at the breaking point.Watch the movie Predestination which shows singular timelines. Should be relevant since the show is heading that way Pilot The Nuclear Man other hints. It will give a better understanding about whats wrong here.,FlashTV,cprisnw,1,t5_2y6bs

3568026,0,t3_3175j7,Okay a few thingsFirst off I think that they are going with the Abrams Star Trek rules of time travel where a timeline tries to repair itself as best as it can but as a result some things happen differently or at different times. In the Abrams Trek movies for example the crew of the Enterprise still ends up becoming the crew of the Enterprise but the events of Neros timetravel cause them to become the crew like a decade earlier than they did in the original timeline. So a way to look at it is that originally the CWuniverse would have seen Barry become the Flash when he was in his early s instead of his mids. Maybe it would have happened drastically differently but the main players would have still gotten their powers. As for why Eobard wants to kill Barry. Well... in the comics there have been several reasons as to why Eobard hates Barry including and at times including several of these at once comics spoilers A longtime feud between the Thawnes and the AllenWests Thawne being a deranged fan being a future villain who was pissed that the Flash just happened to stop some of his th century villainy during a time travel adventure and... well just being evil.,FlashTV,cpyzd17,2,t5_2y6bs

The original timeline where you grow up through A B and C still continued after you left it doesnt stop.  In the alternate timeline you kill yourself and continue living through A B and C again in the new changed timeline.  This example is only seeing the perspective of the time traveler whereas I look at the universe.Theres only  scenarios here.  there is causality in which case it is a single timeline and you create a paradox. there is no causality which means it must be a separate timeline.The original timeline doesnt just disappear and if it truly changes then causality is in play and creates a paradox.  It must be one or the other.  And most if not all time travel in a single causality timeline would cause a paradox in some way due to the Butterfly effect.  Even moving the air or kicking a rock while you walk could change things that could create a paradox.I understand what you are saying about a single timeline not affected by change but in order for that to be the case the original timeline must be a separate one.  There is no in between.,FlashTV,cqsu3nl,1,t5_2y6bs

3862421,0,t1_cqwag02,Yeah I was sort of disagreeing about the fact that he may of copied Wells DNA and used that to alter himself realistically I know SciFi is kinda the answer here so the term realistically doesnt really apply the device attached to Wells and then made Eobard look like wells.It didnt take pictures or scan his body as far as we can tell so it must have gotten the raw data on Wells body from somewhere and all of that information minus things like hair style and clothes etc would be stored in his DNA. However whether it actually copied his DNA to Eobard is unknown and probably not ever going to be relevant though Geoff JohnsI think did say that the device copied over some of who original Wells was and that comes across in Eobard and had to come from somewhere which kinda would go more into the argument of nature vs nurture than anything however in regards to if it actually did it would to me depend on what the device that he used was and for what purpose it was invented.Due to the fact that it killed Wells it seems unlikely that it was a common device that people used every day therefore Eobard either invented or stole it from someone else. So if the person that invented it did it to simply become someone and steal something Everyman style then it would have no reason to copy something like DNA however if the device was created to infiltrate somewhere then what better way than to actually copy everything about a person including their DNA whoever you are infiltrating would have no way except memory to tell if you are who you say you are. Yes the concept is silly but a. Its SciFi and b. the device is FutureTechAnother point in your original analysis of it is that you say if he did steal the DNA then Wells would no longer be a speedster as it is in his DNA this is not nececarilly correct as if the device was invented by Wells then he would have invented it so as to copy his speed abilities across I dont remember if they ever showed that any of Barrys DNA showed differently due to him being a speedster however at the point where Wells will have given that sample he was disconnected from the speedforce for whatever reason and so it may not show up as the thing to remember here is they run the sample and then bin the sample in a place like Star Labs and just keep the results of the tests run on the sample.Also it has yet to be shown in this incarnation of Reverse Flash if his abilities are innate in his body like Barrys or given to him by tech in his suitsomething like a future version of the tacyon device that allows him to absorb and use speedforce energy.As for the final point of why not just absorb Barry a few possibilities one it may only work copying a regular person onto the template of a speedster dont know the limitations of the device it may be that copying Barry would alter the timeline too much and lead to Eobard never being born and as he knows this he refrains from doing it. Or it may be that the device is one time use and the components to recharge it or build a new one dont exist yet.Would have typed that out a little more in my original post but was on my break at work so typed it quickly missed out actually making the point I was trying to make.,FlashTV,cqwjtmb,1,t5_2y6bs

Especially with Kryptonite in the equation without it the Flash could probably do no damage to Superman only evade everything.I can understand if you dont like overpowered superheroes even though Garahel explained perfectly why thats OK but its no good Idea to say that aslong as you are OK with the Flash DBecause Supergirl would be exactly like the Flash from a powerlevel. Their only limiting factors are they themself. btw great explanation by Wells about OP Speedforce and why Barry still gets beaten D,FlashTV,cqwzyuw,3,t5_2y6bs

Joes acting was really good especially when he was holding the gun to his head and screaming. Eddies acting felt inconsistent and a little bit clunky. I love how General Eiling ends up voicing his inner Mr. Krabs Cuz the actor is actually the voice of Mr. Krabs and Batmans love child.

3907541,0,t3_3547at,Okay so throughout this series we saw Team Flashor Flarrow vs Bad guys. Team Flash consists of . Barry who provides the team with abundant amounts of Speedforce and plot and gets the team support in return.. Wells in earlier episodes provides his wisdom and tips and gets  helpplus his own plans in return.. Cisco provides Barrys suit and gadgets in return he gets to be the funny one and also gets help from Barry. Caitlin also pulls her own weight and helps Team Flash through Oracleing. In return the team had to dealt with all the drama of Firestorm which actually became a plus in the end.. JoeEddit. Do I even need to go on?... in broader sense Oliver DiggleFelicity even Lance all have provided their help.Iris isnt Team Flash. She was supposed to be representing the normal worldto connect the Flash to the people of Central City. Guess what? Except for a few split seconds her contribution doesnt quite match out her demands.Yes her anger with Barry and Joe is justified if you take out the context. But how she deals with the responsibility is just pure childish chaos. you should tell me the truth everybody watch me while I storm out of a expensive partydinner what is that blue thingget my father back its your fault Eddie was kidnapped caitlin you lied to me all that tiem that isnt contributing thats just useless demanding. She has shown time and time that she isnt qualified to more responsibility. Snitching out the Flash when he asks her not to etcLook at her job. Iriss job isnt a true reporter. She is just a freelance blogger brought in because the higher ups thought she could bring more stories about the Flash. Thats it. Thats what the newspaper thinks of her. And thats what the writers would think of her. Her contribution is just a trophy for the Flash and thats it.Her comparing to Lois Lane is a terrible insult to Lois. Lois actually does shit as an reporter its just that Metropolis is a little bit more dangerous than she thinks. We saw very little of what Iris actually does in her own. Look at what she found. There had been  weeks of time plus nine months and the thing she pulls up is that metahumans might have something to do with the particle accelerator.  Well to us viewers that information has been dead for centuries. Look at how Barry Joe Cisco and Caitlin had to brief her events of like  episodes just for her to cause more drama.And then she demands that she deserves more?Maybe thats not a bad thing. Maybe instead of having flaws in everybody and drag the whole series down the writers decided to create a singularity black hole of useless drama to make others much more likable seriously every arrow character Ive seen in the Flash becomes likable how is that possible even with Speedforce ?,FlashTV,cr1p06w,4,t5_2y6bs

4023245,0,t1_crevk4y,The Reverse Flash he was fighting with was from timeline A. Nothing has stopped his existence.Timeline A exists before the TV show does. Its whatever timeline Eobard is from.When Eobard goes back in time to kill Barry and ends up killing Nora instead he creates a new timeline and gets struck in it. Well call this one timeline B. Eobard from timeline A is now stuck in a timeline B.Fastforward quite a few years to Barry trying to stop a tsunami and accidentally going back in time. He does some things differently and whappow! Were in timeline C.  The Eddie Thawne of timeline C kills himself. Maybe that prevents Eobard of timeline C from ever being born but it has absolutely nothing to do with the Eobard from timeline A which is where Eobard is from. Yes Eobard is in C because of his actions creating B and then Barrys actions creating C but hes not from there.

That radical birth of a new timeline probably caused a wormhole...That wormhole contains enough energy probably more to offset the energy lost in removing all effects that EddieEobards existence has on the universe. Eobard not existing  an enormous amount of things not happening from the countless lives altered from particle accelerator to Harrison Wells not dying to Barrys mom not dying...so many things that Time itself was like Fuck dealing with that shit its too much energy im gonna create a second version of that universe where all the energy that it takes to change an Eobardless universe is represented by this fuckhole of a singularity. Deal with it. Hence a nd universe that has to deal with a World ending blackhole.Im just a casual comics fan with some college courses in physics so obv this isnt actual science but its a way that Im logically processing this. ,FlashTV,crexqyy,2,t5_2y6bs

4045016,0,t3_36vc1u,Hello everyone! Ive been a long time lurker of this subreddit and a big fan of the show but hadnt posted anything in the past.This is something that Ive been experimenting with. Ever since I watched the season finale of The Flash I wanted to see what happened the night at Noras house with all the scenes of Reverse Flash at Noras house in chronological order so I thought why not! As youll notice while Barry is in the Speed Force I have added some scenes of Barry speaking to his Mom and the fight scenes before Present Barry went into the wormhole. Thats because I wanted to match the scenes in chronological order right as they happened. Therefore Barry gets into the wormhole while Future Barry and Reverse Flash are fighting at Noras House.Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!,FlashTV,crhd1sw,72,t5_2y6bs

4052924,0,t3_36yh2c,Personally I think hes part of another timeline. Obviously he knew that saving Nora wouldnt fix things so we can assume Nora probably died for him too. That means something changed with this night to start up the timeline we know.When Barry time traveled the first time he was running next to himself. We see this from both angles. These two Flashes cannot exist without the other. So the first Barry experienced the day then went back and became the Second Barry. Second Barry saw First Barry fade to the beginning of Episode . First Barry saw Second Barry fade to the end of Episode beginning of Episode . Going off the Multiverse theory that other day the one Barry reset still exists but Barry no longer exists in it. This is further evidenced by the fact that Cisco remembers dying. His powers allow him to see through vibrations in between universes. What hes seeing is another universe. So the reset day wasnt really reset. It just exists in a parallel universe now.Back to Future Barry. Based on what I just pointed out about those episodes its reasonable to assume that Future Barry still exists just in his own parallel universe.,FlashTV,cri9jb0,6,t5_2y6bs
4053815,0,t3_36xb9q,Some inconsistencies have bugged me a little Barry says that when Reverse Flash fought him at the stadium he said theyd been fighting for centuries which is incorrect. He says Weve been at this a long time.When Hannibal Bates was impersonating Wells he behaved like Wells did in the other timeline and said the exact same things following his instructions which means that Wells knew he had killed Cisco before yet he acts shocked when Cisco tells him that in the finale.Barrys speed has some inconsistencies from some of the earlier episodes. There are some more but anyways Im willing to overlook ALL of those because the show has been BRILLIANT and it makes me happy.,FlashTV,crid6c1,2,t5_2y6bs

4062526,1,t1_crj99gz,I agree. I would have had Clark use his superspeed and saved his pops at the last minute only for him to still die from a heart attack. That would instill the concept that he cant save everyone no matter how strong or fast he was.Take the school bus scene he saved them all when it meant giving up his identity. The fact that his dad entertained the notion that is may have been better to let the kids die is a huge gripe with me about Snyders version of Superman. It would have made more sense if no matter what his dad told him Clark would always help people...instead we get a brooding superman that snaps necks and costs the lives of countless people because of fighting his friends.

4120056,0,t1_crpou00,A few other things of note  As the Queens Gambit never set sail Sara never got involved with the League of Assassins or Nyssa. Neither her nor Laurel become Canaries.  Quentin Lance is a well respected police captain who has his life together.  As Rebecca was not the one who was murdered Malcolm never crosses the threshold to kill anyone. As a vigilante he holds firm to his no kill rule. He hesitated for a few years but finally decided to take his only son Tommy under his wing to join his crusade to save his city teaching him archery.  With Robert Queen in charge of Queen Consolidated neither Isabel Rochev nor Ray Palmer were able to weasel their way in and aquire Queen Consolidated.  EDIT If he gets arrested for the Undertaking I would have Walter Steele operate in his stead carrying out business as Robert would have willed it.  Sebastian Blood found and recruited a scientist named Anthony Ivo who was never killed on Lian Yu who helped him refine and mass produce the Mirakuru serum. Ivo successfuly mitigated the negative effects of the drug and Blood used the serum to create an army. He set the army loose in the city to generate the chaos needed to support his campaign platform that Starling needed saving. Bloods election was thwarted by Malcolm Merlyn and he was arrested for corruption. ARGUS then recruited Blood to the Suicide Squad.  ATOM got his suit fully operational with shrinking and went public. He works for the government in a similar fashion to War Machine in Iron Man placing him in roughly the same role as Cyborg. He becomes dissillusioned and decides to help the metas.  Diggle is called in by ARGUS to drive an experimental weapon into the Metahuman front. Much like Green Lantern in Flashpoint he is quickly defeated.  Not weighed down by caring for Oliver Yao Fei succesfully defeats Edward Fryers and saves his daughter Shado. The two of them eventually cross paths with Merlyn during an international mission of his and decide to join him.  Iris lives in a different household from Barry so he is able to voice his feelings much sooner than if they were living together.During the course of the event I would expect Harrison Wells to devise a powerful serum to counteract a speedsters ability which Merlyn will shoot at Thawne to give Barry enough time to go back and stop him from stopping Thawne. Inside STAR Labs Vibe will get Barry set up on the cosmic treadmill and help him get back to the past.,FlashTV,crpwtxq,5,t5_2y6bs

Despite Eobard being erased from existence in the season finale I cant see the producers actually unwinding all the events of the first season. In addition to just screwing with fans heads it would also mean Nora is alive and it would basically negate many of the emotional moments of the first season.  Also the Grodd episode had a significant buildup of Barry and the team questioning whether they could do what they do without Wells and I think it would be a shame to bring real Wells in just when the team was gaining confidence on their own. ,FlashTV,crxgtjo,2,t5_2y6bs

4553858,0,t1_ct4mbjt,ill try and sum this up the best i can... cause its some big concepts...In  he accidentally taps into the speedforce and travels in the speedforce back one day. While multiple Barrys can occupy the speedforce when one leaves the speedforce and joins the time stream all future barrys cease to exist... Thats why there was only one Barry on the street the FIRST time Barry was there... and why there was only one barry on the street when he came out after attempting to stop the tsunami. In the Crisis Barry and Eobard didnt need Wormholes because they were experienced speedsters Barry could tap the speedforce at will and they traveled back on the speedforce. Barry then traveled forward using the speedforce leaving Eobard trapped in the past.in the finale barry needed the wormhole because he doesnt have that experience yet... he doesnt need the wormhole to time travel... weve seen that. but he needs it to control wherewhen? he goes and to leave a path open to returnthis is why when he travels back there were two barrys future crisisBarry and future wormholeBarry... had he used the speedforce Crisis barrys future would have ceased to exist and he would not have been there.edittypos,FlashTV,ct4mvlb,1,t5_2y6bs

I kept saying to myself while I was watching the show why Flash wasnt fast enough when he fought random villains and now with all these speedsters its going to be hard to maintain suspension of disbelief .,FlashTV,cug3sn9,1,t5_2y6bs
4933173,0,t1_cugbs3k,Young Justice is a cartoon and I dont know what Tower Prep is but it looks like its on Cartoon Network. Without even looking I can safely tell you that a live action cartoon network show and a show airing primetime on a channel not actively geared towards children have different standards of quality. Just cause one thing works in one medium doesnt mean itll work in another. I can watch a Disney show and laugh and enjoy it but I still wouldnt compare it with The Wire now would I.And no you said Flash was all about family and relationships the last Flash run I read had Iris and her superpowered children running around and Bart Allen was always a kid in the Young Justice books and such. Thats what I was referencing. Things that work there wouldnt work on television.Why am i sure this would kill the show? Because of just that. Half the time I watch this show Im convinced its written by idiots. Theyre already past struggling with villains for Barry and how he handles them. Bees he couldnt outrun bees. The only effective villain they could possibly have used was someone else with the speedforce and even then they had to depower him for certain scenes ala the fight with Arrow and Firestorm.And now theyre doing the exact same thing they did with Arrow which is overload it with superheroes and then not give those characters ample screen time good stories or better characterizations. Seriously what did Iris do all of this season minus talk in a cafe and exist. Add more characters and theyre just gonna be aimlessly existing and just giving the idiot viewers a buzz everytime theyre like Oh yay SUPERHEROES instead of them bothering to tell an effective story. What does adding more people with the exact same superpower as the lead character possibly add? Seriously? It just dilutes and takes away from Barry and his situation. Hell what does giving all of his companions superpowers add? Its the most silly lazy contrived fan service shitty writing they could possibly put out. On Arrow everyone uses a bow and arrow on Flash everyone has the speed force. Its fucking stupid.Scale up the threats? They cant fucking write the threats as it is with one superhero speedster why in Gods name would they suddenly find their writing prowess with three other speedsters thrown into the mix. Ohhh theyre gonna make another villain a speedster oh yeah fucking great we can have another season where they deal with the exact same villain as the first season. ,FlashTV,cugd6b2,0,t5_2y6bs

5029540,0,t1_cus5ma6,One of the things that was good about Flashpoint was the tieins which is something rare while some of  minute interludes were taken from them instead of developing its main characters they chose to use it for cameos and plotlines that got dropped. Take for instance Batman. His is arguably one of the best plotlines in the whole event and his is suddenly dropped without ever picking up on it again. We dont really get to feel his sense of loss and hope that his son will have a future we dont get to see that despite all Martha has done as the Joker he still loves her.

Barry has been alonegotta get the team back together! Dad gets out of jaillater Barry! What is Barry so guilty for?Oh apparently Ronnie died to save the city.This is still my favorite show but I really expected better. Still a good episode though.

5314189,0,t3_3nsoez,One way I took it is all the people Barry are with now his new family if you will are who helped him on his way to be the hero hes becoming where the last time Henry was there he was a scared little kid. Its been so long that even though their related by blood it doesnt really feel like hes his family anymore and no doubt its going to take Henry a while to get used to regular living again and doesnt want Barry to take on the responsibility of climatizing him to a normal life by helping him adjust and finding a place to live and a job its not like he can just jump back on to it all cheers and beers after  years in prison Id also imagine he feels its something he has to do on his own. Throughout season  he always said he didnt want Barry wasting his life away trying to find a way to free him and now he doesnt want Barry to waste the life hes built for himself either. An interesting theory I had though is that Zoom has already spoken to Henry and threatened him in some way or something either way Im sure well see more of Henry throughout the season. ,FlashTV,cvqy7sk,7,t5_2y6bs

5334511,0,t3_3o2yit,Barrys dad was just a plot device for the first season he was Barrys motivation to beat Eobard. Now that hes done that and his dad is free Henry no longer has any purpose. Hes no help to the team or Barry except for speaking some words of wisdom. So instead of keeping him on as dead weight and trying to write him into some sort of plotline they just moved him away from the team. This was the best course of action it was either this or killing him off which would just be too soon at this point.

The Speedforce is not him but something he has a connection to. But Id argue most of the rogues so far have mostly been pretty powerful. Some just lack the skill to fully use their powers. Weather Wizard seemed to easily make a Tsunami. Blackout did pretty well. Plastique may have become very powerful if she hadnt been killed. Firestorm is pretty powerful and hasnt tapped into his alchemy abilities yet. Reverse Flash is pretty powerful. Prism ability is difficult to counter without tech ready.Grodd nearly destroyed Barrys mind. ,FlashTV,cw7x8tz,1,t5_2y6bs

Edit Actually I liked the concept of the Doctor and Strax having genunely no idea if Clara is attractive or not.   And the Doctors always been a bit of a sexist pig to his companions.  But I still have a sense of forboding about it Moffat isnt going to address or correct these issues  he likes to poke a stick at Doctor Whos P.C. issues but he then quickly loses interest and lets the matter drop.

It makes no sense for a contentprovider to create a strategy that prevents their content from being viewed. Time Warner does not have a streaming service. In the interim they would like you to not watch their content. Consumers wont go for paying for a subscription for each and every individual streaming site simply because companies like Time Warner dont understand what consumers want. Theyre taking an enormous risk that people will continue doing what theyre already doing  telling content providers dangling the carrot to fuck off.,FlashTV,cwtdbdx,1,t5_2y6bs

5640543,0,t1_cww894u,Gorilla Grodd is a possibility despite already showing up a few times because psychic powers are pretty damn powerful and also Gorilla City hes one of the few major Flash villains in the comics. The Rogues also been set up but we havent seen them in full force yet are also a possibility because their relationship with the Flash is so very different from most herovillain relationships which opens up interesting story potential though the writers would have to step up their game to get it right. Aside from those options I cant really think of any nonspeedsters not only that but theres not all too many villainous speedsters to choose from weve already touched on Eobard Thawne and with Zoom being here it may put Hunter Zolomon out of the picture which only leaves Black Flash off the top of my head which might be too much like Zoom who can really stand a chance against Flash super speed is unbelievably OP and its way more so at Flash levels. The only other option within Flashs source material and without backtracking I can think of is doing a season without a single overarching villain but theyd have to get creative with their storytelling in order to create a cohesive story arc and satisfying climaxes.That said Green Arrow has far less of a rogues gallery to pick from than Flash and Arrow has done pretty good so far actually arguably their strongest villain choice Ras al Ghul was their weakest season proving you dont need a popular villain to have a successful season. Theyll find a way with Flash probably dipping into other character pools. Like they might go with a time travel theme and use a time traveling villain or they could go further into the multiverse theme and use variants of existing characters or big timers like Darkseid or eventually the AntiMonitor especially if their  foreshadowing pans out or they could introduce Green Lantern and go with a space theme. Theres lots of options there and I think itd be better to focus on season themes like the multiverse stuff in S before focusing on season villains.,FlashTV,cww9hwd,14,t5_2y6bs

5642056,0,t3_3seenz,I dont think theres anything that really tells us that Jay is faster than Barry other than Jay being able to continously fight Zoom in Earth . Correct me if Im wrong. Eobard wasnt much faster than Barry however Barry was able to keep up. As for Zoom I assume hes been constantly gaining more and more speed. Maybe at one point Zoom wasnt as fast as he is now and was on par with Jay who is only a bit faster than Barry due to his experience over Barry. Towards the end of this season it would make sense for Barry to be as fast as Jay would be if he had his speed at the beginning of this season.

Hes got no moral high ground for accusing Jay of cowardice especially since he still refuses to acknowledge responsibility for anything.Jay on the other hand admitted that Zoom scared him and that he didnt fight him as many times as he could have.Comparing these two stances I believe Jay over Harry. Harry was just trying to get rid of Jays influence over Barry.Also I dont absolutely believe that Jay is Zoom. In the least because its safe to assume that Harry kept an eye on him and had he had just a suspicion that Jay was doing something shady he would have already happily destroyed his reputation since he didnt and Harry does not dispute Jay being a hero of some sort over his personal comments I think this is absolutely impossible.,FlashTV,cwyqkx3,1,t5_2y6bs

5832310,0,t3_3v31ks,Vandal Savage is scary because hes patient...he literally took the slowest boat he could find to get to Central City got caught then sat silent for weeks before slipping the cuffs and killing the whole crew.  He literally has all the time in the world to do whatever he needs and if someone is being a thorn in his side hell just wait a few decades until theyre older show up and murder them in their sleep.  Heck he even said In all my time I have never met anyone with your abilities ever!...with just a touch of glee in his voice...which is a bit disturbing because they just made the immortal psychopath pull out the big guns he goes around killing folks with flint knives FOR FUN...when he had that Staff of Osiris tucked away in a safe place all along.  Also if this is the same staff that we saw Oliver and John stealing in Haunted...then I think we know why it was locked away behind a barrier that only the pure of heart could cross Savage is obviously not of that sort.  And the really scary thing is that the staff wasnt what that military nutjob we see in the flashbacks on Arrow was after.  We saw only a taste of what the staff could do what could be worse than that?  And does it tie in with Savage in some form?  Like I said hes scary because hes patient he can orchestrate plans that take decades to unfold and utilize thousands of people.This is what makes him dangerous and what makes the current plans we saw of Team Flash and Team Arrow so utterly stupid.  Theyre going to need something totally out of left field to take him out of the equation and like others have said I think time travel will be involved.  If they can displace him out of their time frame...meaning maybe  or so years into their future then that will give humanity time to evolve on its own without his interference neither show will have to deal with him again barring any more time travel itll set things up for Legends of Tomorrow we see Vandal in London  and if Flash or Arrow do want to deal with him again...itll probably be older versions that are more experienced.But Legends of Tomorrow with all their time muckery could erase all of that and mess with the timeline six ways from next thursday but well see.  This is why I love Savage though most of the other villains can be killed or will die of old age with time but Savage...yeah...try harder.,FlashTV,cxk55f3,17,t5_2y6bs

Its like watching the story without the story there because the storys been told so many times by people like you who try to get me to enjoy the movie. I dont enjoy it. I think its terrible.

Maybe I would like it if I watched it  rather than .Oh and the Jar Jar theory is the only way I would enjoy the series at this point.

6335181,0,t3_42cs1s,Well we know that Zoom is not E Barry that has been confirmed. I had a very similar theory to your own and it involved Eobard Thawne killing a young Barry Allen from familialpolitical reasons and Henry becoming Zoom. However I have since abandoned that theory when we learned that E Eobard was coming back. As of now Zoom does have human motivations greed a lust for power and perhaps a hint of jealousy. It really doesnt make any more sense for Zoom to be Henry than Eddie or anyone else. Its hard to tell which Flash is in the house with Barry. Logic would dictate that its the Flash of the s but what we have heard from Kriesberg on Fatman on Batman contradicts that a bit. If the Flash of the s is warning himself to not save his mom its very obvious as to why he has done that.gt Eobard You could have had everything you ever wanted.gt Barry I already do. The Flash of the s has learned that his mothers death while a tragedy helped shape him and everyone he loves. He cant save everyone and he has to let her go. If the Flash of the s warned Barry then he likely never even encountered Zoom for that to be a factor. Not much in what Zoom has said or done indicates he is anyone but Eddie. Im not saying he is Eddie but our only evidence is clues through Harry and Zooms dialogue. Zooms dialogue and actions give strong indication towards Eddie and little indication towards Henry. We see towards the end of season  that Eobard is hammering in that Eddie isnt important to anyone. The Flash is important Barry is important Eddie is nothing. Barry and Iris would end up together the Flash would have a long beloved legacy and would live on as god through time. Even after all that Eddie kills himself to save Barry. Hypothetically his body could have been transformed by the singularity into what we see as Zoom. A process so horrible and painful all the while blaming Barry for this horrific fate. After all if it werent for Barry Eddie would be with Iris and would be happy not a speed monster. But in the end you dont need to establish some outlandish scenario you can look at the evidence. What characters were most important to both Eddie and Barry? Characters they competed for the approval of? Joe and Iris. Where did Zoom take Barry before arriving back at Star Labs? Central City Picture News and the CCPD. Zoom calls attention that Barry is not a god and not the hero they need. To Barry he cynically mentions that heroes die. Even in a dream sequence he claims that he wants everything Barry has. Th notion of heroism is something Eddies arc was somewhat centered around. His last words were centered around that fact.gt Thats all I ever wanted to be your hero.That being the last thought before dying and becoming a speed abomination could give you serious cynicism towards heroes in general. Eddie saw Barrys importance around his speed Barrys abilities allowed him to be remembered as the fastest man alive. Zoom wants to take everything from Barry most importantly he wants his legacy. He wants to steal the speed of various speedsters to be better than Barry but he is going to greater lengths for Barrys speed than even Jays. Zoom wants to take away the very thing Barry will be remembered for. He will have failed Central City no museums built in his honor he will no longer be the Flash. Instead until the end of days Zoom will be remembered as the Fastest Man Alive. He will finally have the legacy he always wanted.

Garrick mentions his DNA was mutated when he became a speedster but until they have hard scientific evidence from testing that doesnt mean that Hunters cells wouldnt help him.gt besides what would they tell CCPD hey we need to borrow your computersBarry didnt tell them shit he just used the computer systems on his own.

6614152,0,t1_d03fbzx,Yeah I expected this to get buried among the theories posted but often times television shows are written over the long term like the show runners and teams discuss what is feasible for a ten season show why the newspaper from a possible future is dated  thats the series finale time loop yo. So they wouldnt try to have plot strings get too twisted early on and exhaust certain devices like introduce too many simultaneous arcs resulting in some being ignored or some being superfluous. Ive got a feeling people need to examine the possible twists in terms of world building which gives the writers more material to include from the comics and keeps it flowing smoothly over the long term instead of burning out. Thats why Edward Clariss being from the Golden Ageesque Earth makes more sense than suddenly claiming he was on Earth all along in season  and targets Barry instead of Jay. Earth Eddie might be dead for good but if it wasnt significant and a key bit of info it wouldnt have been shoved in our faces like that.,FlashTV,d03gjx1,1,t5_2y6bs

Not to mention he had advanced warning that he would die thanks to barry. Since hes from the future maybe he knows there are  possible outcomes for him. . Flash saves his mom and some alternate universe that we havent seen yet happens which will happen at some point since the future flash that stopped  S flash from saving his mom has to know what consequences will come from saving her since he went back to stop himself and . what ended up happening at the end of S when Flash listens to future flash and lets his mom die.

6658953,0,t1_d082rda,You put that very articulately! Yeah I did like thisseason Iris much better  although she has substantially lost her cattiness by the end of season  too I think. I do see what you mean about Patty and his lying to himself though and trying to lose himself in this new relationship though  hadnt really thought about it that way before. gt Both Barry and Iris needed to mature.Totally agree but thats kind of my entire gripe really  they certainly needed to mature but we didnt see that process. They just both seemed to very comfortably fall into their respective positions and be completely happy with it  like it came very naturally and nothing had come before then. Perhaps we just didnt have enough screentime to see that steady attitude development take place. It only struck me as slightly lacking just because of the excessive screentime their developing and changing attitudes were given in the first season and the change was just neglected somewhat in this only as an afterthought. The sudden shift in focus and priorities made me feel like Id missed something. Does that make sense?Definitely agree that Earth dynamics are now going to potentially colour Earth relationships. I do wonder how theyll handle Earth Joes passing  will Barry even mention it to JoeIris? Anyhow thats an aside.,FlashTV,d083cz3,3,t5_2y6bs

Mainly because at the start they had Caitlin run tests to check for speedster things and found nothing.  It might also explain how he says Zoom stole his speed and then later it just mystically changes to the whole I used velocity  and lost my speed.  Breakdown in communication right there.  E Hunter is the notspeedster and probably the one whose cells were dying from some illness too.But yes pretty certain in my own head that its been a bait and switch.  Mostly Zoom with his E standin for when he needs an alibihas to run off to do some nefarious crap.  It just all went to heck in the last week because geomancer was doing things that werent planned for there was no time to go grab his E counter to stand in as he went back to his lair hence the long nap.Please send help.Edit Also convinced there has never yet been a Jay.

But a lot of complex contract and rights things are happening behind the scenes that block just allowing everyone access to media. Wikipedia on the subject of geoblockinggtThe ownership of exclusive territorial rights to content may differ between regions requiring the providers of the content to disallow access for users outside of their designated region for example although an online service HBO Now is only available to residents of the United States and cannot be offered in other countries because its parent company Time Warner had already licensed exclusive rights to HBO programming to different broadcasters such as in Canada where HBO licensed its backcatalogue to Bell Media who may offer their own similar service specific to their own region and business model such as CraveTV. For similar reasons the library of content available on subscription video on demand services such as Netflix may also vary between regions and may not compare to the quality of the services offering in the United States or may not even be available in the users country at all.,FlashTV,d0ghprx,2,t5_2y6bs

6778845,0,t1_d0kdrle,And she got this info from Jay who may or may not be a bad guy. Im just saying that this is what I think. At the very least it should be plausible that he could have lied multiple times. They never showed her checking park guys info or anything else. She just took Jays word for it. Again why would he lie? To keep her working on velocity. I understand last season they kept on spoon feeding us bits about Doctor wells being reverse flash. Maybe thats why they kept Jay missing a lot in the earlier episodes. Also why did zoom carry his dead body to his lair and call it a complication. Was it because the holes are closed or because he killed his informant? The guy in the mask got upset when they mentioned Jay. He is in a speed cage like Barry was making it plausible that he still has some speed. Either way the writers will do what they want and speed force but still this is where Im at. Also just read below that weve only seen zoom syphon speed force with Jays flashback. Why did he need wells to syphon speed from Barry? If he cant syphon speed like he did with Jay then Jays flashback is a fabricated story. We saw the story Jay was telling us   This may or may not be what actually happened. ,FlashTV,d0knze5,1,t5_2y6bs

We never see a full shot of Superman but hes shown rescuing Kara from her space pod after it crashes on Earth and taking her to the Danvers family to live with them we also see baby KalEl on Krypton at the start.

Basically there are metahumans in Supergirl now. Previously everyone else was either an alien or a crazy normal dude with the exception of Bizarro Supergirl who was created by Maxwell Lord and thats one of the reasons everyone hates him. Theres weird sexual chemistry between Olsen and Kara s And the big plot of the show is that some people originally from Krypton who had been sentenced to alien prison are trying to save the Earth by killing all of the humans through some secret plan called Myriad s Kara and Alex work for a government agency called the DEO that monitors and apprehends aliens. Its leader Hank was Martian Manhunter all along so now hes on the run. The new head of the DEO is Lucy Lane Lois Lanes sister.

My reasoning is when Hunter is dropped off at the orphanage his name is given as Hunter Zolomon. Hes a kid he probably doesnt have the ability to change his last name. Children typically are granted their fathers last name especially in the case where the parents are married and the mother took on the fathers surname.Hunters mothers maiden name is Garrick. this is my guess. I have nothing to back this up aside from my above explaination.This is how Jay The Flash Garrick can get away with being a hero and not be accused as a murderer which would be the case if his fathers last name was Garrick. Most people probably wouldnt know the connection as Hunters mother would probably change her last name to Zolomon after marriage. Garrick wouldnt be a known name.,FlashTV,d2an88j,3,t5_2y6bs

Barry amp Iris...Cisco amp Dante... man...when Cisco saw E Dante get merked...then just ran in and hugged his bro. That shit was on point. The decisions Barry had to make this episode....it was a very mature and insightful slice of Flash. And it still had Zoom being involved. Zoom is going from force of evil to present villain. My man doesnt need to murder every single person he comes in contact with. he just needs to teach lessons. hes not obeying caitlin hes just trying to appease her. he still merked all those cops like it was nothing. hes just not killing the main crew. and why should he? they cant do shit. they were cool with him for a while. in fact they assisted in getting him cured. hes not the desperate Zoom he was when dying from V. hes pretty much the undisputed king of all earths right now. this episode knocked it up a notch with the particle accelerator explosion.... jesse and wally getting got.... Barry vanishing... all three of Barrys father figures together while Barry struggled to find his own path. and my man Zoom showed up just to laugh at them about killing Barry then dipped out again. now THATS some real villain shit. last episode really let me down though so I feel you on that.

I dont know much about TV production but Id imagine that sort of a shift you want to have time over the hiatus to design. I could be  percent off and if they had this past episode arced out from the beginning and they must have they could have been working on it through the season. the only trouble is they wouldnt get to tease season  with a big flashy first look at a new suit.,FlashTV,d2xxt7l,1,t5_2y6bs

He then learns about time travel and becomes fast enough to travel through time he instead travels to the current time period.

His speeches were Strong and powerful and even when him and Clark were in the same room he always gave off the aura that he had the upper hand.Also the sense of destiny and jealousy of Supermans powers and a sense of greatness. and cold focused thinking Thats what made him great.Here is the last speech he gave in smallville I have not seen a villain on either show who drew me in on ANY show. and on TV the only other time I was drawn is was on a Sorkin show e.g West Wing Newsroom Sports NightMaybe I did not see enough of Clancy Browns Lex but he always rubbed me in a sense of being more towards Donald Trump says hes great very loud kinda obnoxious and likes to be the center of attention.

Unless Henry uses an alter ego alias when dressed as the Flash it doesnt work Barry called his mom and she told him she amp his dad were going to Atlantis and The man in the iron mask was already trapped at the time,FlashTV,d39upfq,2,t5_2y6bs
7633262,0,t1_d39lw0q,Loved the look. Id be happy to see more of her if she was written as a complicated villain or really Id be happy to see her turn good. I never had a problem with her on the Arrow but maybe there wasnt enough there for her to do after she stopped being Ollies romantic interest a lot of it seemed to be interactions with her father which just wasnt enough. ,FlashTV,d39uz9w,1,t5_2y6bs
7633405,0,t1_d39vh3n,What if he hopped dimensions swapped dude in the mask for Henry swapped their clothes then hopped back in time for Barry to see it!The only teeny tiny bit of evidence I have for this is he said Your mom and I are so proud of you. That could just potentially indicate its the Henry from E where momma Allen is still alive.Or Henry is just dead. We shall have to wait and see!,FlashTV,d39vkba,8,t5_2y6bs

I was actually offended for Katie Cassidy in her last Arrow episode the fact that the writers tried to retcon her characters entire relationship with Oliver beyond just being ineffective and dumb was downright disrespectful to the actress and the character.    So instead of building my character up over the course of four seasons giving the audience reason to care about her and giving me an opportunity to you know act were just going to write in an extra five minutes of plot from season  that would have been almost completely out of place and out of character at the time?

They probably wont have another Wally as a West relative on Earth given that theyre setting up black Wally as Kid Flash but that would be easy to have in another universe. Simply show a universe or maybe a separate timeline say without Eobard killing Barrys mother where Joe and Francine stayed together had more kids and somewhere in the family theres ginger Wally. He could show up to help Barry and our Wally in some kind of Crisis storyline.Edit Even better Idea In an alternate universetimeline Joe remarried after Francine to Nadine who already had two kids Daniel and Rudy.,FlashTV,d3f5vjb,2,t5_2y6bs

So okay Flashpoint Paradox is cool sure but they have just wrote out everything that had happened. All gone in a poof. Also Paradox is not just about Flash there is a lot about the Justice League. It just seems like poor writing to me. Had they have ended with Jay being dragged away and some other event at the end things would be better.

So since barry doesnt become the flash Thawne doesnt become the RF.

This also means theyre cousins theyre both named after their great grandfather Wallace West.On this show the wests are Black already its not as if wallys mum was white or any of the wests were white.

7945277,0,t1_d4926nb,gt ballot is one thing and nominations is the otherThey are completely different. The ballots are to determine who will get the nominations. The ballots are the way in which the candidates are filtered to the nominees. Think of them as the primaries if youre American. Anyone can run but who gets nominated in their category depends on who gets the most votes in the first round.Virtually everyone who puts themselves forward for consideration makes it onto the ballots. The ballots typically have hundreds of contenders. You can see this is true in this years Emmy ballots For the acting categories as well as other categories actors can submit themselves OR the studio can submit on their behalf. Submitting yourself or a studio submitting you on your behalf for the Emmy ballot is actually a lot of work if you do it right. People put together campaign reels highlighting their best work and submit them with elaborate for your consideration packages to all the eligible voters. It really is like running for office in many ways.If Carlos Grant and Tom and Wentworth Miller and John Wesley Shipp and Katie Cassidy and a few others arent on the ballots its almost certainly because no one submitted them. Some people just dont care about awards and many actors dont bother because they rightfully figure they dont have a chance in hell of getting the nomination anyway. ,FlashTV,d494gfc,9,t5_2y6bs

Were borrowing the COIE concept of the universes colliding and building our own story off that. The true COIE storyline took lots of build up and setting up in various comics and we want our movie to standalone.The movie will not be out any time soon and for the moment we dont have a release date as were a team working in our spare time rather than a full time studio.,FlashTV,d5ephmo,53,t5_2y6bs

8941872,0,t3_52rbga,Fingers crossed this means theyll nut up and give some actual character development to Caitlin before she becomes The Flashs Felicity aka an undeveloped character forced to the forefront of the show and just not continuing to develop despite being in the damn forefront. Making E Caitlin into Killer Frost is the single quickest and most effective way to give an otherwise undeveloped outside of her two relationships with other characters.... character a boost in character development especially if you want to give her more screen time moving forward. While Ill never say Arrow was a good GA show because it wasnt and any GA fan knows that Ill openly say it was a good action show way back when...they truly faltered when they decided to take an undeveloped uninteresting side character and force her to the forefront of the show and then develop her it makes everything seem forced beyond belief. Ideally especially given Caitlins need to not kill and not be evil and the fact that being a heat vampire as E and comic book Killer Frost arewere forces her hand and almost makes it a necessity to kill...shell become a sort of antihero akin to Season  Firestorm and well be forced not by plot but by story to see Cailitn grapple with the line between what she wants to be the good doctor and what she has to do kill to live. I also hope this episode delves into the metagene outside of the particle accelerator because they alluded to it with Deathbolt back in Season  the Error mini crossover but didnt speak of it much since and theyve since confirmed  at least according to E Wells  that Caitlin doesnt have an active metagene. Doing a closetocomic origin for her would allow for further metagene exploration which makes sense given the fact that it seems Dr. Alchemy will be making metahumans...,FlashTV,d7mojcx,64,t5_2y6bs

9120825,0,t1_d87pw37,I dont really think that thats a problem. I mean Flashpoint has a lot of extraneous stuff going on and kind of implied that Barrys mothers death was the only thing that kept the DC universe from collectively losing its shit. Thats not something you can really do in  episodes but as long as the core remains the same the notion that Barry and the world are better off in the first timeline then it can still work. IN the same way that Captain America Civil War wasnt all out war between two huge rival factions and didnt have Spiderman caught in the middle it still focused on the notion of controlling and regulating enhanced individuals and the nature of Steve and Tonys relationship. As long as the spirit of the thing is maintained it can still be a good story. Still hoping for Flashpoint Barry to get the ring and have the ReverseFlash costume pop out just for the look on his face. ,FlashTV,d886afz,1,t5_2y6bs

Also his character does seem like the kind of guy that would go to extreme lengths to get what he wants. Like pretending to be crippled for so long. And finaly he could just not have it. the whole reason he is here is because he lost his speed.

Its hardly a loss. Its not like Diggle had two kids but now only has one. He had one with a different gender. gtBarry gave a man a daughter he never had robbing him of the potential memories of raising her and leaving him emotionally confused to the Nth degree.That was actually Steins own doing. The episode description of the Legends episode states that Stein is going through the fact that he caused an aberration that caused him to have a daughter. gtBarry created a new wave of killers and monsters because of flashpoint.Alchemy is doing that but I suppose we can blame it on Barry as well. ,FlashTV,dan5xku,1,t5_2y6bs

9837793,0,t1_dapj1qg,I disagree with some of what you said but supergirl and arrow crossover didnt feel sincere. It felt more like arrow with guests but iirc it was their th episode. I think it was still a good episode. Flash and LoT felt like more of a blending of shows. I really kind of wished supergirl brought the antialien bomb. It wouldve made so much sense.I dont fully agree with cisco being mad at barry for his brother dying. It wasnt directly his fault in my mind. I imagine a lot of actions people do everyday cause random deaths but the only difference is barry knows what his unrelated choice caused. Theres also the fact that the team gave barry permission to save his mom in season .Dominators are definitely coming back. How could they not?

What you say about x is very valid although theres always the handwavy Eobard faked tons of stuff with the help of Gideon and future tech explanation. The fact Joe hadnt heard of Tess Morgan  the backstory of this extremely famous man prior to his conversation with Eobard has always bugged me but that could just be some iffy writing.But its certainly true that originally Harrison Wells was  a pseudonym  Eobards little joke  and that was changed at some point.

It wasnt about the kids best interest. At all. It was about Oliver. He was keeping a second family hidden from his lifepartner. Thats huge. Personally I think she overreacted. Then again I think Oliver should have told her and tried to reason with the ex. Fucked up ultimatum she gave him. But anyway... Barry knew about the two minute time limit. He knew that a singularity would form. He blew it off to fight RF. RF..the guy Barry had contained. The timetravelling killer he planned to set loose and send home. Why?

I also dont think it would be HR since that would be just a cheap way to kill someone without offing someone important and probably why like seemingly  thinkhope it will be either him or Julian.My money would go to Joe. Being honored can be interpreted in several ways. I wouldnt be surprised if Joe would be the replacement for Iris. Would also make for drama. Well either Joe or Wally if it doesnt turn out he is the betrayer or the one who suffers a fate worse than death.This is a show about Barry Allen. Having two Speedsters for Central City would take the focus too away from him. It would also eventually once Wally improves take most of the threat away from the villains. Barry can eventually defeat the antagonists but how can they realistically create suspense with two speedsters being around. Wally will leave the main cast eventually imo for one reason or another. Not to mention that it is unlikely that he would be the one to actually defeat Savitar.,FlashTV,de0orlo,1,t5_2y6bs

10889151,0,t1_de2d02j,I thought Wow they really seem to be investing a lot in a fight against a nonspeedster they probably have a great idea for something to challenge Barry with then. And it just turned out to be a pretty bland fight with rather random moves. There were some nice moments like when Solivar just figured Hey Im just going to run to one point in the circle that he seems to be running. But a lot of the challenges that Team Flash faced seemed pretty random instead of well thought out. But even more so the solutions to these challenges felt even more random. As if the writers just went Okay they need to get out of this literally any solution will do. Maybe I just missed too much but the freezing Barry thing.. what was that about? How did Barry recover from that? Or was he not knocked out and just holding his breath? Did he just thaw quickly enough? And why did Barrys ReverseFlash move punch Solivar away so hard? Isnt the point of that move that you can phase through someone not punch them away? And why didnt he just use his long distance attacks? The biggest advantage he has against Solivar or any gorilla is that there should be absolutely no way for the gorilla to get close enough to Barry to punch him. But most of all its a feeling. It just didnt pull me in. And it can be hard to explain feelings. I think I would like it if they found a way to nerf Barry. That would make a lot of this challenges he faces a lot easier on my suspension of disbelief. Maybe something like there being so many speedsters using the speedforce that speedsters in general become a bit less powerful. Edit I am still hyped for the next episode though. I can easily see how an army of supergorillas would be a challenge for Barry.,FlashTV,de34zsd,3,t5_2y6bs

Mehcad Brooks aka James OlsenGuardian got the only CWVerse nomination in the category Best Supporting Actor for a TV show I just dont get what the f the qualification for that would be... JamesGuardian has IMO been the weakest point of Supergirl for so long and the actor himself has barely had any interaction with Supergirl even.Why wouldnt they pick David HarewoodMartian Manhunter who has been so much better?Or pick no one from Supergirl and take Tom Cavanagh for best supporting actor or Jesse L.

11015766,0,t1_defwv5x,All the seasons are pretty much the same. Only thing were missing right now is the like  second clip at the end of every episode that progress the villains story ever so slightly. Even if Savitar were still alive? the main arc would still be pretty boring because its so washed over.Honestly I only keep watching for the day to day fights he has with minor villains and the subplotsrelationships between all the other characters. CW needs to figure out how to keep people interested long term or their viewer count in going to drop significantly. gt If they absolutely must have a season long arc why not have Barry perform some complicated task or solve an interesting mystery. I was so disappointed when I figured out that Flashpoint was only going to be like  episodes long. I thought we were finally going to get a break from speedster villains that Barry will obviously overcome and then they spat on my dreams. Side note Also wouldnt mind Godspeed next season though because I just fucking love his costume but CW will probably ruin it. Theyll make it too grimey to fit his name. ,FlashTV,deglty3,1,t5_2y6bs

The stone isnt Savitar if we listen to Jay in . The stone gave him his powers like the lightningdark matter did to Barry.Thing is they realized in this episode that Savitar was trapped inside the Speedforce so they basically threw him his key out.

He got his speed from the philosopher stone and traveled the Multiverse creating armies and that he is a god.

Thats how he lost his powers and had to recreate the flash.

Hopefully they write it so the Barry waving no is from before that costume change or because the fact that Barry sees the suit in the future he will change his suit to that one earlier.

In the season  premiere of Flash Thawne gave a whole speech on how Flash needs to let him go so that the flashpoint timeline doesnt set He specifically said This world will become permanent. Itll set like concrete. So the mechanics are the same. Setting apllies to both.  Another example is when Barry was accidently sent to the future and saw Savitar murder Iris. Jay just said its a possible outcome. That the future isnt written. The speed force also said that if Barry doesnt like the future then he should just change it.  That it isnt set. ,FlashTV,dfmu415,1,t5_2y6bs

Im not sure why youre trying to argue this and ignore the writers and such but ok lol Also I never said that taking it was the only way to having blue lightning?

It was only killer frost and ciscos brother dying. There arent any good challenging villains and most of them are from flashpoint which is good but Id also like to see some from the original particle accelerator.The rogues certainly arent used like they should be. Id like to see Lisa snart mirror master that girl who causes headaches and weather wizard try to form the new rogues. Savitar is good but he isnt like zoom or reverse flash. Personally Id like it if we knew who he was as in he revealed his identity to Barry at the start but we dont know why hes doing what hes doing.

I think Cisco and Iris have had all of ONE episode that Runaway Dinosaur Speedforce one which I think was overrated and a very odd episode. If thats indication of the IrisCisco banter then no thanks. Wally? Eh hes not the best actor but then neither is she? Joe Ill give you but thats mainly because Martin carries those scenes. Most scenes with Joe and Iris its Martin doing all the heavy lifting with dialogue and all Patton has to do is look sad and cry on cue. They can write her character better and give her more to do but she still has to perform the material. I dont Pattons acting is very good most of the time on this show.
