6501996,0,t1_czru329,When I first got Spotify I was thinking of Bands to add when I remembered Foster the People from . Seeing they had a new album I hit shuffle play on it and Fire Escape was the first song. I was like what the fuck? did these guys record their second album on an iphone? man they mustve really hit tough times.,FosterThePeople,czruszn,2,t5_2tiyx

11787886,0,t3_67w8dp,Im in love with all three songs. SHC reminds me A LOT of Supermodels sound. Doing It for the Money NEEDS to get radio time its a total anthem. And Pay the Man is an absolute bop.,FosterThePeople,dgw72ra,2,t5_2tiyx
