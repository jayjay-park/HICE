753667,0,t3_22qws1,The details youre describing sound pretty accurate at least in my experience but they wont seem as amazing when youre living them. The actual stress of school and the weather and everything will take its toll after all. Still if thats what youre looking for I cant imagine anywhere else will live up to that image better than UChicago.,uchicago,cgpy5rt,8,t5_2qh46
827234,0,t1_cgyarl8,Its all Park district area including the Japanese garden. The Japanese garden doesnt focus too much on plants but there are a few flowers and such. I assume you wouldnt forage parts of the landscape artistry. ukelny is talking about the Bobo Links Meadow  its all connected in the general Jackson Park area. Bobo Links is a natural prairie preserve transitioning into a savannahlike area near the baseball fields. The Park district owns all of it  thats why Im not sure if foraging is formally allowed. ,uchicago,cgyb3mx,1,t5_2qh46

1876943,0,t3_2g2q22,I enjoyed Intro to Micro a lot if just to learn a little about how economics works.  Its worth doing it since youre at one of the powerhouse economics schools.  Little Red Schoolhouse was OK  if you have any doubts about your writing ability you should take it.  If youre already a strong writer then its probably not worth it.Ive been told Mearsheimers class is good but like Sanderson he has his own opinions on things and you should be aware of that.Of course part of the appeal of those classes is that you get to be with the big name people  considering how much UChicago costs its probably worth it. p,uchicago,ckfd54h,1,t5_2qh46
3306149,0,t3_2wt6fe,UChicago students are easily the worst part of UChicago. Youve got kids who have chips on their shoulders because they didnt get into Harvard hardcore libertarian Ayn Randgargling econ majors talentless theatre kids there is no other kind of theatre kid in general though who have read too much Joan Didion deeply closeted frat boys who feel like they need to dress up in racist costumes every weekend to assert their masculinity people who play sports poorly and unironically hipsters who do too much acid and complain about how hard their classes are and all variety of borderline autistic nerds.Theyre only slightly worse than any other group of  year olds though. And if you can stand them youll get the finest undergraduate education in the world. Itll kick your ass but not as much as people would have you believe just get off fucking facebook and study. Afterwards youll be condemned to a lifetime of wondering why everyone else around you is so dumb.,uchicago,cp54l6w,7,t5_2qh46
