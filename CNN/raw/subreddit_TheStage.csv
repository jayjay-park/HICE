3325235,0,t3_2xotz5,Just to offer a nonPC alternative I bought a used Tascam DPFX track on eBay for around  and a used nonamer condenser mic for around .

After using the pairing to write hundreds of songs I tried using a USB mic and recording right into Fruity Loops for awhile. But I notsoslowly drifted back to the gritty bedroomreverb sound of my condenser mic and track.,TheStage,cp7az2m,1,t5_331ci
