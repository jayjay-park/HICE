7035607,0,t1_d1dl5pc,Yeah Jezebel is just a strange paradox of conflicting opinions. I kind of thought about it and considered how with an analog interface medium like the human brain it might be possible that there is a conflict in her programming that makes her say one thing and do another. I kind of like to think that maybe shes so on the fritz that nobody could possibly make sense of her this kind of explains why Isabelle made the mistake of trusting these robots.,Automatron,d1dubvn,1,t5_3d9rv

7119106,0,t1_d1lmu5a,Claptrap? From Borderlands? With some other armaments Mr Clappy might just be the perfect name for it!  ,Automatron,d1nctmw,2,t5_3d9rv
7336489,0,t3_4fqxsy,Depends on what you want to do with the robot personally I like to have a close range weapon and a long range weapon and have the armor do damage when enemies get close,Automatron,d2c3wtq,3,t5_3d9rv
7344023,0,t1_d1zmhmz,Gatling laser damage increases with the Big Guns perk  I think at least it looks like it did for me  and with extra pieces of voltaic armor. If that  bonus stacks you will eventually get your gatling laser base damage high enough that the Space Monkey helm is the better deal.,Automatron,d2cyqnh,1,t5_3d9rv
