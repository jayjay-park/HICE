24736,0,t3_1udxqd,Im on mg of Zoloft the highest dose! wah  mg of Abilify klonapin and then . mg I think of Inderall a blood pressure medication that helps to control my heart palpitations due to anxiety.  I have had a very very positive and successful experience with this combination which happened to be the first combination of meds.  This combo nearly knocked out all suicidal ideation  I went to the hospital because the ideation got so bad so its an impressive feat for the meds to help that much.In outpatient treatment the team said that medication will only help about  the rest of recovery is up to us.  I couldnt agree more.  Meds help to take off the edge but it really is your responsibility as to whether you are going to take charge of your mental health or not.  The biggest thing that has helped me is affirmations.  I tried them on a off over the years but couldnt quite get the hang of them until I took my meds consistently.  Turns out thinking positively stirs up lots of negative painful memories for me so I need the buffer of meds to do the important work of changing the way that I think.  Its getting A LOT better as of recently and when I mean better I mean really getting to the heart f my pain through affirmation work.  As of right now Im doing a lot of work where I write out the painful limiting beliefs that fuel my anxiety stuff like Im stupid worthless and dumb.  Its helping to write out the thoughts when I have them and to keep writing them until I feel relief or until I can see the absurdity of them.  I took meds on a off for about  and a half years and those years are lost time to me for the most part.  I highly recommend meds and this is coming from a health nut newagey sensitive to meds person.  ,getting_over_it,ceh8z0t,4,t5_2rtne
29455,0,t1_cehsaep,Of course they were rather upset. They were shocked I had a boyfriend and the lengths I took to keep him a secret. They were really shocked that I met him online. They found out about my Facebook. They ended up going to his house and tried talking to him and his mom. My mom and his mom got into a fight because his mom let it slip that I had slept in the same bedroom as my BF the entire weekend. So now my parents thought I had had sex with him and started calling me a whore. My BF at the time ends up giving my folks access to his facebook so that they could view mine. He thought he was helping the situation. No he was not. He didnt even ask me if it had been alright. They screenshot the entire thing. They got pissed about a lot of what I had said. The night they called me demanding I take it down I was having computer troubles and couldnt access it. I ended up giving them the password. Big mistake. Before deactivating it they went through all of my private messages and screen shot them as well. They learned about everything.   Like I mentioned earlier I kept my best friend up to date on most things. My folks were especially mad about learning about the trip with my best friend. My parents were hurt and angry and so very upset. They werent satisfied with the answers I gave to their questions to explain my actions. They would get angrier as a result. However they did try to be understanding. I know I scared them so when they suggested my having a GPS locator on my phone I agreed to it to ease their mind. They kept track of me at all times. I ended up breaking up with the BF. Soon after started dating someone new. Again they somehow found out and got mad that I didnt tell them. Again I told them I didnt know if it was something serious. That he was just a swell guy. Because I had met this guy at school and he was older than I we would go out to his friends places to hang out. Some of them lived in not so great parts of town. One night we ended up having to spend the night at his friends place. My parents looked at the GPS and were furious that I was spending the entire night at some possibly dangerous neighborhood. My mom lost it. Started calling me a whore again and just went off. I told them we hadnt been able to leave due to some peoples being drunk off their asses and refusing to give us keys to move their cars. Again they thought I was lying to them. That was the day that I took the GPS off my phone. I had also changed the password to my student site because they kept bitching to me about attendance and grades and just not accepting my answers. They just assumed everything I told them was a lie. Again I was getting kicked out of the house. They would call me up fighting. The week of exams apparently my phones GPS was reading that I was in an hour away from school instead of sitting in the dorm lobby with my BF. My parents start calling me but because Im trying to study and know that they just want to fight I ignore it. They end up calling my BF. Keep in mind Im sitting right next to him. I can hear my dad telling the BF that Im not in my dorm and asking him why I was in the city. The BF tells him that I wasnt in the city for he had just dropped me off at my dorm. My dad tells the BF that hes lying and that if I ever want to be a part of the family again I have  minutes to call him back. I call him back. We fight. I tell him that Im at school. He asks why the GPS is wrong. I tell him I have no clue. Im at school trying to study. Never told him I was sitting right next to BF. Obviously the GPS was wrong for some reason. After the phone call I was in tears and couldnt calm down. I end up missing my final the next day. Thankfully my professor was aware of my family issues and was willing to let me retake the exam. However it would be on the day that I was supposed to be returning home. Trying to explain to my parents that an exam time got changed was really difficult. They didnt believe me. I couldnt tell them that I had missed my exam. I had blamed them for that once earlier in the semester because my mom had kept me on the phone for hours the night before my exam and didnt let me sleep. It was the same thing again. I tried telling them that the professor had gotten sick or there had been a family emergency. They didnt believe me. We got into another fight that ended up in my being told that I was trying to push them away from my life and that I was kicked out again. This was two days before the end of the semester when all students had to be out of the dorms.,getting_over_it,cehsakk,1,t5_2rtne

She doesnt need to clean up a big mess that I made in her absence. is it weird to be talking about myself as if I am two people? I hope not.

373979,0,t1_cfj9mc7,I still just cant come to terms with the positive thinking idea I think if you ignore something that exists negative thoughts then youre lying to yourself. What I think might be a better solution is recognizing negative and positive thoughts equally but appreciating positive thoughts while remaining neutral toward negative thoughts.gtWhat always does it for me is realizing that Im just a human being observing whats on this orbiting rock of ours. Its weird I know but picture just how small you really are compared to this universe and these problems we have seem a bit pointless. Ive actually thought a lot about this and for me it usually leads to me having an existential crisis spanning over the course of a few days. Probably not good for me.,getting_over_it,cfjj0lj,2,t5_2rtne
477280,0,t3_1z5608,Absolutely loved this post. The way you expressed your worries and the strategy to manage them shows great insight. You are good at turning the worry energy into a positive reflection of a given situation.Maybe your worries and fears spark up because you are highly sensitive and intuitive protecting yourself from people places or things that will not benefit you and your spirit. How do we know the difference between ineffectual worry versus our intuition telling us to listen to our gut instinct? As I work with my own fears I too will work out a mental strategy to help bring a bit of peace to my moments and choose to think I am being intuitive instead of worrying. Funny how just changing a word can make a difference to how my mind interprets and emotionally reacts to so many nonoperant fears.We have been conditioned to react negatively to so many slights or misunderstandings in life were drowning in emotional confusion fear anxiety and self imposed solitude. The way you see the default negative in your thoughts or actions then create a plan to come from a positive more accepting view of a situation is truly a major accomplishment. Congrats!

672845,0,t3_21uetx,Hmm. Well I had another situation where things turned sour. And this was a ldr. I live in jersey. She lives in Ohio. I think maybe in one respect it made it easy. But in other parts of the breakup it made things more difficult. I wanted to hate her. But I couldnt. I loved and still love her to this day. It was the only girl I imagined marrying. Everything was magical. I think w when you dont see somebody for a while either the anticipatory elements of the long distance love makes feelings so much powerful. But I think drifting apart can be easier when you are already miles apart. I first blocked her on Facebook. But I thought that was too aggressive. I just removed her from my friends list. Eventually I deleted my Facebook. I found that in all of my relationships Facebook played a negative role in it. It became down to what does this site offer me?  Heartbreak? Seeing how much more successful my friends were doing? Im not saying its a waste of time but its a waste of time ,getting_over_it,cggr3gz,1,t5_2rtne
761171,0,t3_22u8sh,Hey there. First of all let me just say right out that you should avoid talking to your wife about these issues you have. Especially emotional ones. Never show your wife your emotional insecurities in that manner. It is not healthy for a relationship long term okay?You need to find and build close male friendships. Your wife is not a substitute for your lack of friends in NYC. You need to find and maintain new friendships in your new life in order to keep the relationship healthy. Otherwise you will overwhelm her and will likely drift apart. Thats the hard truth out of the way.Sounds like you have some things to figure out and it is totally understandable in your situation. So it going to take a few years. But with work and effort you will find new friends and become happier. Just dont get discouraged. Nor burden your wife too much. Things will get better.,getting_over_it,cgqsuul,1,t5_2rtne

Sometimes the point of professional help isnt about progress or failure. If the money isnt so much of an issue  that is you are not starving or under a roof or in any real physical danger then why wouldnt you go? After those things money shelter comes your health your wellbeing.  This is it. This is the same thing as having a broken leg and going to the ER to get a cast.

950032,0,t1_chc858o,Look up the medical board for that state. They almost always have a button for consumers and you should be able to look people up by name business name or license number among other things. If you have trouble let me know. Every state med board is different but all should be patientfriendly. Malpractice actions and such are separate from discipline. Malpractice concerns cases brought by patients which may or may not have merit to them. Normally they will only be listed by the medical board if at all if there was a judgement against the doctor so settlements usually arent listed. Acts of public discipline from the medical board are not as common as malpractice actions and should always been taken seriously its not just a disgruntled patient. They are an action by the med board taken against the doc  often after a complaint or tip by a patient another clinician or pharmacist or a third party like a family or law enforcement. If the med board investigates the complaint and find public discipline is warranted it will be there. The majority of complaints however are resolved without discipline or with only a private reprimand. ,getting_over_it,chc9yoz,7,t5_2rtne

1553852,0,t1_cjagkbt,This was a great idea for a MM post. Theres a lot of work that goes into navigating the mental health system and figuring out what works. I think for those who have never had therapy before they remain skeptical because they see people go through counselors and seemingly struggle to no avail. Actually it can feel like that even during therapy. I really think it takes a while for some lessons to sink in. That in addition to managing meds and life and its easy to why it takes so much time and energy. Ive learned a little bit from each person Ive talked with. A lot from some specific ones. Right now Im not seeing anyone because I realized I needed to gain confidence listening to myself. What I need help with only I can make a decision about. It took me a while to figure out that there are some answers only you can solve for yourself. It is a good feeling to be on the other side though. ,getting_over_it,cjb1rp7,2,t5_2rtne

1655632,0,t1_cjnq3s9,Thanks you have been a great help!.  my favorite philosophy is stoicism. I think that what enabled me to have an somewhat  satisfying life up until I was faced by the difference between what I perceive and feel and what other people perceive and feel. I keep a voice journal it helps me evaluate relationship for example something happened and I thought a certain thought that forces me to shun it away and I wait to see if it actually true. It helped me keep few people around me. Went from nothing to few good friends. I know it is tough and I agree with the medication. It helps me reshape my thoughts and feeling better.

It sounds like your parents love you and want the best for you so let them help you any way they can.

7133531,0,t3_4d7gj9,Ok so a lot of good points by people here. But from what I can see the advice is all towards ditching it asap.I am going to ask you a question and I want you to think about it and consider it before answering. Do you want this relationship to work out or not?If not then ditch it like everyone else is saying. You can find other girls and have new relationships.If you do then you need to calm the fuck down. Yeah what she did is highly suspicious and she seemed like she is either experimenting pushing boundaries or something. It is hard to say whether or not she is actually trying to leave the relationship because if that was the case I doubt she would have told you about it. It is hard to say exactly why but jumping to conclusions which you already have to be honest with your reaction is not going to help anything.Sit her down face to face and calmly i repeat CALMLY talk to her about this. You may have to start it with an apology for freaking out at her because she may refuse to even discuss this if you dont followed by you telling her why you reacted the way you did. Tell her that you are sorry for freaking out and getting angry and that what she told you hit a nerve for you because you are not the best at trusting and you can go into the reasons if youd like or you dont have to and that what she did seemed really suspicious to you and you jumped to the seemingly obvious conclusion. Do not accuse her of doing anything sinister or make her actions bad or wrong just tell her how they seemed to you and how they impacted you. Once you have established some communication then talk to her about it. STAY CALM. do not freak out. do not jump to conclusions. just talk to her and ask questions. If she refuses to answer and you have stayed calm and have not started to become accusatory then ask her to answer because her actions have hurt you and you need answers in order to reestablish trust with her.If in the end you find out she was planning on cheating or what ever then you can handle it from there. If it turns out that there was a different reason or motive for creating that profile then there you go. Either way you can make this choice from an informed and calm position rather than making an emotional automatic reaction.Remember STAY CALM when you explain your actions explain them through your motivations emotions and mindset instead of blaming her or accusing her and do not become hostile or defensive. You are trying to probe and reestablish trust not turn this into a blame war or argument.,getting_over_it,d1p04qg,3,t5_2rtne

That is how all of us who have been addicted to drugs severely depressed dealt with learning disabilities anxiety  all of us with mental issues who have recovered had to do this.It is entirely possible you arent ready to get better,getting_over_it,d2ppz7c,1,t5_2rtne
7612411,0,t3_4jilmq,I tried this for myself with initially unsuccessful results. Can I make a suggestion? Instead of good things or nice things which happened Id suggest things Im grateful for today.Like others have said some days  especially when youre depressed  there doesnt seem to be anything nice  good happening. This can make you feel more depressed especially if you feel like youre letting someone down by failing.Things Im grateful for is way more open it can be something as simple as I have a friend who cares about me you in the case of your friend or even I have a roof over my head. Hopefully it will be something more than those examples but some days it wont be. This approach also takes the burden off your friend of finding something good or nice  when youre depressed it can be literally impossible to find anything pleasant. At least Im still alive is a thing to be grateful for but it doesnt always feel like its a good or nice thing to a depressed person. Etc.So Id go with something Im grateful for today. This has helped me personally when the good or nice things which happened today failed. Getting through today feeling there is something worth living for today day by day is a powerful aide to depressed people  and is a more achievable goal.Didnt sleep last night but I hope I got my point across. Good for you OP for caring and trying to help genuinely wish you and your friend good luck. ,getting_over_it,d37hp5t,7,t5_2rtne

I also make myself leave the house for however long I can manage. Sometimes just the eating and drinking water helps the thoughts die down other times it just makes them more quiet. ,getting_over_it,d39nufx,1,t5_2rtne

Then Id think Oh  looked at me this way when I was leaving and then Id think oh  was tired or  missed a comment  said or any other plausible reason they would have acted that way toward me. I look for real believable reasons why people dont hate me. With practice I now usually assume people like me I havent recovered completely yet yannobut also sometimes you make really shitty friends who bad vibe you and do this constantly. if one person specifically makes you wonder if they hate you fuck em.,getting_over_it,d3eizgh,0,t5_2rtne
8021247,0,t3_4p2ta4,Disclaimer I was never severely depressed i.e. could always function well enough to at least make it to classes for tests wasnt late for work etc.  That said I think as I became less hopeless and depressed my desire to do activities I enjoyed returned and along with that came the desire for people to do those activities with.  I still have generally very little desire to just go hang out in a large group at someones house but group camping backpacking or rock climbing trips dont make me dread the human interaction.,getting_over_it,d4hnwj5,4,t5_2rtne

8920749,0,t1_d7k11yd,Well you simply dont have a boundless obligation to do something. I mean certainly people may say so but they are incorrect. If you wish to be homeless ultimately you can be homeless. If you want to lay on the couch forever within certain bounds you can lay on the couch forever.The question is about your situation and what you want to do about it.  If you want to stay put or die then stay put or die. You can blame others for that if you want but recognize that nobody will listen to you and ultimately after a certain extent few people will really believe you except out of ego validation for themselves. That might be your thing. I dont know. I suppose the only thing I would counsel you to do is not to have expectations that your thing generate anything other than what it does. And if that makes you upset then thats pain and if you want it to go away you have to change something.If that pain isnt sufficient to motivate change then it isnt sufficient. And you are relatively speaking happy doing what youre doing. shrugTheres no way for me to simply council you into joy over the human situation. That is a spiritual philosophical and therapeutic matter. And Im not a priest or therapist nor am I in my capacity here a philosopher.,getting_over_it,d7k56bb,3,t5_2rtne

I know this is considered a weakness in adults in a lot of modern Western culture but hell why shouldnt we want such a valuable and lovely thing?The trick is I think to put all your love into the friends and family you do have. Love almost always only grows especially when you do that. Ive discovered this about myself anyway. I hope you find an outlet for that too. ,getting_over_it,d99jpv4,2,t5_2rtne
9673003,0,t3_5ddj92,Ive been in psychoanalysis sessions for a little over a year and have seen quite a deal of progress.  my main goals were to have more clarity and be more motivated.  or just to get out of my monotonous routine that isnt a future.  its a slow processas it is you analyzing your everyday life in detail. it develops into having a mindset of seeing what is offsetting you to adult. its a very critical thinking approach.  i think the best advice is what you yourself give  and the therapists job is to help you develop your understanding of solutions. hope this was helpful in some way!  good luck!,getting_over_it,da5efg8,2,t5_2rtne

9880008,0,t1_daueg9s,As someone who has struggled with pretty bad anxiety and depression in the past its so refreshing to know that youre there for him in that capacity. He may not fully realize it now but you being there for him in that way is the MOST important thing he has right now. Most people would just peace out or make things worse. Speaks wonders about your character. I wish I had someone like you at that time. Dont give up on him and most of all dont take any of it on as a reflection of you. None of it is your fault. ,getting_over_it,davdzkb,3,t5_2rtne

10186929,0,t3_5lry56,Primarily be gentle with yourself and try not to feel shame if medication is what helps you. Also if you are afraid of being dependent on medication think of it as a tool rather than a solution. Use it to get to a place where you are able to rely on other methods exercise diet acupuncture therapy etc. And also remember that it is okay to not feel okay. Give yourself the advice you would give a dear friend and whatever method has worked for you in the past can work for you now but it doesnt have to be permanent. Dont get disparaged if you feel you have lost all of your progress you are at a unique advantage because you are a warrior who has been through this before. If someone lost  lbs then gained back  you wouldnt look at them negatively so think of those pounds as months you worked hard to get months of happiness in your life so dont let these few months make you feel that that progress was all for nothing. Lastly give yourself permission to be sad ask for help have an off day and take it one hour at a time. ,getting_over_it,dbyqth1,3,t5_2rtne

11113000,0,t3_5yn7k5,Its important to know the side effects definitely and if its not making things better definitely worth considering alternatives. BUT I think its important to hear of successes too.  Ive been on Lexapro for a  few years Im starting to taper down on doses at the moment and its definitely saved my life.  It did take me a while to adjust and there were quite a few side effects although I actually didnt gain weight because of it. And I did have to work hard in other ways therapy exercise meditation etc but this got me to a point where I could actually do those things I couldnt leave the house most days before.Good luck! ,getting_over_it,derndrl,3,t5_2rtne

11300972,0,t3_613c0c,Im not going to give you generic advice because it doesnt help me and as you said it doesnt really help you.What your going through is grief. The main problem is not that the house is gone but that she is. You have to identify the underlying issue.The problem is grief takes its own time. You are not expected to get over of a death of a parent in a few months. The normal time that it takes people to come to terms with a loss is  months. What youre going through is expected. Be patient with yourself and understand what to expect in terms of being human and getting through loss. The house is a reminder. Its out of your control but its related to her memory. If she was alive the sale wouldnt have as much of an impact Im willing to bet.So what can you do? Well the best thing is to either . Work through the emotion using CBT a great app is MoodKit its costs a little bit but Ive had it for a few years and its been helpful in moments like these or . Distract yourself. Feelings follow thoughts thoughts follow action. What works in distracting you is something you should analyze see what worked for you in the past in difficult times. But finding an engaging task even its some form of work can help. Be around friends engage in hobbies finish off the project youve been putting away for a long time. Being busy makes sure your mind doesnt dwell on unfortunate things. An idle mind is a devils workshop.That being said when the feelings are overwhelming take a step back and remember her. Recount what was good about your relationship and indulge in the emotions you need to. Just be wary of doing it too much since the advice bottling up your emotions causes you to explode later is a myth. Expressing too much of your angersadnessjoy leads to more of it in the future. Its just how the neural pathways of our brain works.Im sorry for your loss and I really wish you the best of luck.,getting_over_it,dfcy5li,1,t5_2rtne
