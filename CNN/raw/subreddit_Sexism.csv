3629521,0,t1_cq5v659,Thanks for the reply and the clarification. Yeah I guess my problem with feminism and even MRA for that matter is that both preach wanting equality yet divide themselves solely based on name. As if the pursuit of equal rights has becoming a pissing contest of some kind and one side needs to piss harder than the other by pulling privilege on the other.I dont call myself a feminist. Nor do I call myself a MRA. I pursue equal rights for people nothing more. ,Sexism,cq5zrmn,1,t5_2s3eq
