2227054,0,t3_2kmx67,I just finished watching Episode  and I plan on staying the weekly route just to drag the experience out and make it last. Although I havent finished the show yet these episodes are making me sadder and sadder. I love these characters I watched Season one when it first came out as I was entering High School for the first time Its been a formative part of my lifeand I cant bear to see it go. Over the years Ive become emotionally attached to all the characters and while I know that RJ will go on to produce lots of other great content I just cant see myself parting with this cast of crazy characters. The fact that I got the privilege to personally meet them at VidCon makes it even harder. I wish there was some way to at least get one more season or some short content once this season ends!,VGHS,clmwufe,7,t5_2u3bd
2250604,0,t1_clpvzrb,I think that LoL is a bit more approachable. Theres a lot of stuff in DotA  that is not intuitively easy to grasp as a newbie unless you played the original DotA.,VGHS,clpwaas,5,t5_2u3bd
2254236,0,t1_clpvzrb,With everything else people have said another reason is that league of legends was released long before dota  so its had time to build in popularity.,VGHS,clqcgh6,2,t5_2u3bd

2279212,0,t3_2latve,Not who youre asking obviously but I can answer a few things and give a few insights on the end after watching the last two episodes.  Obviously no spoilers will follow only vague answers.  I was concerned as well at episode  as I found the end to the second season abrupt and out of nowhere wrapping up way too quickly without a satisfying end to any of the major plot lines involved.  A great deal was just dealt in the way of storyline progression that I had no idea how they could finish it.  That said they tackled the monumental task of completing the series in two episodes fairly well.  The plot lines are finished and everything ends in a satisfying and sensible manner.  I dont think it was perfect but it was certainly above par and a fitting end..  To be honest after seeing the end Im glad this is the end of this arc and the characters involved.  The story they began with season  is finished and complete.  I dont think it could honestly survive attempting to continue the story with these characters indefinitely.  I would have rather have a good complete story that makes me wish there was more than a good show that goes down hill after its been kept on life support well past its prime.  .  The last two episodes particularly the last one are a little longer than the rest in the season allowing them to add a bit more story.   extra minutes might not seem like much but creative and strong writers can do quite a bit with that time.  The finale in particular uses it very well to do a lot with a very short amount of time.The point is dont fret.  The story ends where it should and even though you will want more As one is want to do with every good story you will realize it is for the best that this is the end.  I wont say anything else and I hope this helps you understand what is to come.,VGHS,cltfget,2,t5_2u3bd

2321715,0,t3_2lvmy0,I just want to say thank you.  To the entire writing staff actors tech crew and anyone else who made this possible.  Let me start off with how I felt before watching this episode.  I just finished class and had a  hour gap until my next so I decided to do some work.  That didnt last very long and I saw that the new VGHS episode had come out. I got a little emotional when Calhoun gave Brian some life advice.  I took it personally.  When the scene between Jenny and Brian had finished I was in tears.  That really hit home.  Now I understand that the story is written for all to enjoy but for me I felt such a strong connection to Brian.  I never had a father.  The few years he was in my life was filled with cigarettes alcohol and abuse.  Im glad that one day he just left and never came back.  My mother I will not speak ill about due to the fact that for some reason I do not understand still keep in contact with her.  But I will say that she does fit the profile of Brians mom as well as have had the same effect on me that it had on Brian.  From a young age I had to cook and care for myself.  I used to call myself independent.  Until I reached high school and met a certain girl.  Never before had I understood what it meant to rely on someone.  Never before had I realized that life wasnt so painful.  Never before had I felt love.  It took a  year relationship but I now realize that I wasnt independent...I used to always feel alone.Fast forward to senior year of high school and an impending conflict had yet to be addressed.  It may have been a little too late but when we did we told each other that it was going to be okay.  I was going to college  hours north she  hours south.  Freshman year of college I would travel  hours over the course of a weekend to keep the relationship working.  I still dont know where it really all went wrong.  Maybe at the end of high school we could have used Calhouns advice and enjoyed it for what it was worth instead of forcing a relationship that was destined to fail.  Maybe we tried so hard because we were lying to ourselves.  Regardless instead of being happy about what I had even though I was the one who ended the relationship my case being similar to Brians where I felt as if I was the victim and not feeling as loved as much as I loved them I spent months dwelling on how bad it ended.  Im a sophomore now and though it has been only half a year since all that drama happened I feel as if it has been quite some time and things are better now.  I didnt expect a feels trip nor did I expect to hop on Reddit and rant Im really sorry btw for whoever is reading ALL of this so much about my life but I just felt the need to share.  High school was quite the trip and honestly with all I had on my plate Calhoun was right.  I had no problems.  I was a kid.  I still am young.  But now I have responsibility.  I have class in  minutes so no more ranting and thank you to whoever read this and againTHANK YOU FOR MAKING VGHS HAPPEN.  ,VGHS,clyoew8,32,t5_2u3bd
2327485,0,t3_2lxwcd,Id have to disagree. Ive always thought the realism in games on the show was meant as a representation of how the player sees the game. You put yourself into that world and it feels like reality.,VGHS,clze20v,13,t5_2u3bd

2376432,0,t3_2mkuwk,I for one was very pleased with the way the show ended. Sure it left a few loose ends dangling but theres no way the RocketJump guys could tie them all up in these short  episodes. They still managed to do a great job furthering some character development and giving us the endings that really mattered. Personally though I dont see much possibility for VGU but Im hoping! Thank you so much RocketJump for one of the most entertaining most innovative series of our time. I hope to see something similar out of you fellas in the future.,VGHS,cm5fp14,3,t5_2u3bd

8587546,0,t3_4xfcyw,I think the show ended pretty well. Fourth Season would probably tell a different story than continue Brians though maybe before Brians story or sometime after all that went down.,VGHS,d6f15gz,10,t5_2u3bd
