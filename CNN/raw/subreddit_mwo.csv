69246,0,t1_cej8jwo,truth  when playing the boardgame each side decides on the ruleset to use and if they are building custom mechs they have to be verified as legal according to the rules used.  Or each side can pick the basic variants that are in Battle Tech and that is it.So for instance if playing a  scenario each side has to roll on the mech assignment table in order to figure out which Mechs they get if only using the standard variants.  The Mech Assignment table also depends on the faction used so only certain factions have access to a specific variant of some Mech or different mechs.Customizing is certainly a part of Battle Tech but only in that context of the rules that are decided upon.  In MWO its all random matching so that lack of choice of deciding who gets what or who uses what or which Mechs or customized Mechs are allowed is not present since there is no lobby or private server option where players decide on rules beforehand.,mwo,cemb9pu,1,t5_2t1w0

215580,0,t3_1wkymf,You dont.The best thing you can do however is play to the bet of your ability and dont take it personally when you do get your face kicked in repeatedly.Keep your mouth shut follow your lance leader or commanders instructions even if you dont agree with them.  If he say push that ridge and you are gonna die you do it and dont hesitate.  If you have intel or targets bring it up and if the commander wants to shift primary based on new intel he will do so.  Dont talk about stupid shit and clog comms.If you truly are new to this game Im honestly going to say no matter what skill level you think you are you wont have much to contribute until youve been at it for a few months.  You will be a drag on your team while you get up to speed both in skill familliarity with the weapons and game dynamics and leveling your mech and buying better components and modules.Youre going to be going face to face with people who practice this game  days a week in the same mechs with the same people over and over and over.  Perhaps your corp is good enough they can carry you but unless youre in one of the top tier corp I doubt it.  Every mech counts in a comp match.  Trading one for one is never a good deal so strive to stay alive and put fire on targets when its needed.  Dont be too timid though.  Dont get out of position.  Stay where youre supposed to be or with the rest of the team.Ive been playing for months now and sometimes I still feel like a drag on our  man drops.  Weve got players who are just naturally better than I am in every sense both on our team and the opponents.  Im not a bad player but Im not top tier comp material either.  It takes time to hone your skills and battlefield awareness and responsiveness so stick with it and dont let anything get your down.  If you fail in a  man setting its a failure on the entire teams part based on tactics positioning drop deck communication and members.If you think youre going to be splitting off into lances and pulling some commando shit in a  man you better think again.  Only lights get to do that because they can reposition fast and they usually scout or distract.  Heavy and Assault tend to ball up and move together unless you have a tactic that requires flanking or attacking from multiple angles.  Mediums tend to be backline or skirmish support for lights if fast enough.If you can hit the enemy they can hit you.  Only expose yourself to fire when you have the advantage unless you have no choice.  Your opponents will most likely be poptarting and exposing themselves for no more than  seconds at the most.  You have to be able to hit them in that window without being hit yourself.  Good luck with that.,mwo,cf2zz4l,6,t5_2t1w0

283761,0,t3_1xcle7,how fast are you going in the dragon? I can get a jagermech up to kph ish with  UACs and  medium lasersand depending on the variant other support guns with an xl. With  tons of UAC ammo you have between  damage in ammo plus your back up guns like streaks machine guns andor  medium lasers for another  point punch up close. Its one of the stronger ballistic platforms its guns are high up and with the xl you can peak and move very quickly. Unless I or my team really fuck up early on I can usually exceed  damage in that thingwithout artillery just a zoom mod and maybe seismic usually closer to  and its not uncommon to get  rounds.Small caliber ballistics have the highest DPS of any weapon at the moment especially if you have the spaceslots to get multiples of them.  AC will out dps  AC  or  or a gauss  AC is a very reliable long range punch and  UACs will destroy anything in seconds unless youre really really unlucky with jammingi just mash the trigger down and say fuck it. If you do jam  the other usually still shoots if you jam both youre usually just barely peaked over a hill and can retreat. The Jaeger can mount the most of these small ballistics in the most effective way and do it with good speed. It can also convert really well to Burst or Spike damage like  gauss rifles  ac s  ac s or a PPCAC mix.You already have it but the TBolt S is a great more durable alternative to the dragon. Its limited to a  engine but it can take an xl  bigger missiles and more beams and has the jumpy variant  and match the dragons firepower and use its arms to shield its body.The next step up is the cataphract the D IM and Id say the X can be made it to very swift flankers basic dragon type fastish mover run around a corner or peak a hill unload the big guns get down and coolreload repeat. For the D youd drop the engine to a  the ac to  acs or uac s with ppcs instead of ERLL and add jump jets. On the marmot youd drop the energy entirely for UACs and a few mediums.The orion looks interesting I havent run them but it looks like they can also get speed up to the s with similar loadouts its just thy mount the ballistics low on the torso and look more missile oriented or up close brawl oriented then the typical dragon hit an run.Id say the line for dragon like flanker in terms of speed and maneuverability ends at the victor. You can make the battlemasters move and its beam guns are up high but the engines to do so are huge and expensive and youre kind of a running barn at that point with not as much firepower as youd like in a mech that size. Also no JJs.Victors load several loadouts like dragons beams in  arm ballistics in the other a few backup missiles in the torsos and they can jump. They also have enough space to load really big ballistics like the ac or double UACs or triple ac on the armexcept k its more beamy.TLDR Id say if youre interested in fast flanky high scoring DPS mechs JaegergtvictorgtcataphractgtTboltgtBattlemastergtOrion,mwo,cfa6c60,1,t5_2t1w0

425282,0,t3_1ywpgc,Ok. I play in x tripple monitor invidia surround.And when I look left and right I can see the cockpits end... and my FOV is not something crazy the cockpits just were not built with the features you want in mind.So What im trying to say is hey would have to put in art time to make the cockpit  degree complete then a lil code time not alot for a feature so big to add support.I dont think they will implement this any time soon not really bad on them its just that the player base that would use this feature im guessing is small this game dose not do much to attract the advanced sim crowd the game just isnt very simmy the controls are simplified. the gameplay while fun is kinda shallow and thus they would not get much out of the effort to implement it.Honestly rigging my track IR to the game in  x  did not do much for immersion or give me an advantage. Lack of dof means i can only look left right and down and cant lean to look further out of my windows.

I was a MW guy back in the day and those are the style mechs I remember.Ive made a multireddit that includes both this and outreach and you can always pick out the submissions from the mwo sub.

612568,1,t1_cg9vkyn,Yes on a pure tonnage standpoint  counting in the massive amounts of ammunition and equipment the LRMs require to operate  when you combine ALL of it... its now approaching parity with other viable weapon combos.  Thats the end of it.You can easily put  tons of weapons amp ammo on an LRM mech without even trying and is that REALLY justified compared to  tons of ACs and PPCs?  No not really and in particular not on slower mechs.Again no matter how well you did in your little A run you would have been more useful with something that had direct fire weapons or was in a position to guide the shots.  Indirect fire is the thing you do while you are moving into position if youve got spare shots because its a COMPLETE waste otherwise.PS  Is nobody in your games using freaking AMS?

1185354,0,t3_27kicz,I think what the OP is seeing is a fairly recent phenomenon  teammates refusing to engage enemy mechs.I remember in beta this problem wasnt wide spread and at launch it still wasnt wide spread.At some point it became a very wide spread problem to the point where this can happen  or  games in a row. There you would be shooting at enemy mechs exactly what you are supposed to do and your teammates within m would refuse to engage and simply stand there the entire time or walk away.I have no idea what caused this. In Beta there were tons of newbies...but at least they still attempted to shoot back even if their aim was poor or they overheated. Now lots of players dont even TRY.I have no idea what they are thinking. They will not respond to any attempts to communication. They will not shoot except to defend themselves. If there is a teammate right infront getting shot they will not shoot to help even if they are on  heat. They will instead walk away.I have seen this on both ends and it is just completely bizzarre when an enemy mech shows up and instead of shooting you he looks at you and...walks away. You could be shooting his teammate and he wouldnt care at all.Is this some kind of new trolling? Are people attempting to actively sabotage games like this?

If it wasnt the game would be a little...elitist and not have a wide appeal which FP games needHere are my thoughts for which now I am wondering if this shouldnt be its own post...Has it ever been suggested to incorporate a separate rule set for those who choose to use it?A separation of hardcore players and casual.  FP games attract a lot of casuals thats the idea... its free try it out for a few months try something else come back ifwhen you miss it.  They offer some paid pieces so they can make money.  Hardcore players will probably invest a lot more  there for keeping the game alive but they also need a more hardcore setting to play in.They have a match making system already tweak it for with a toggle for this hardcore mode.  in hardcore no rd person.  no armlock.  umm.... not sure what else at this point but make it a valid choice so the playing field is set and you can choose to participate.What comes to mind for me is DayZ.  Big fan of that game since the early days of the MOD.  One of the things I like are the hardcore servers.  no rd person  in MOD days no UI telling you health and such.  Those restrictions changed the way the game was played.  Play casual to learn how to play the game or goof off. Play hardcore and unlock another level to attempt to perfect.  make better use of things like ARM REFLEX and TWIST speeds.right now it appears the MM system is kinda being used that way.  Solo que to goof off.  Group que for a real challenge.EDIT  This isnt a call to separate the community to casuals and hardcore.  more of a stepping stone layout to add some challenge when extra challenge is wanted.  ,mwo,cjcchz5,1,t5_2t1w0

1830817,0,t1_ck8rkol,Youre basing that off one of the very first FP games that made a lot of mistakes as your point of reference.  They tried to nickel amp dime you for important gameplay features.Over again in say PS  if I drop  on a camo half that or better on a sale! I can use it on everything I own for example.  I feel like I got a good value for  in that case absolutely.  Meanwhile I have to pay three times that for a single cockpit item I can use in precisely one mech over at PGI.You do NOT want to start charging small amounts for vital features or you turn into a shitty facebook game.  You DO want to start charging small amounts for cosmetic stuff and grind reduction however.Literally the only thing PGI has ever priced reasonably is the hangar bays by comparison.  Plus their Must buy three to master mechanic ends up making the  a mech even MORE ludicrous to the point of bat shit.So yeah.  I stand by absolutely that massively slashing costs would see a huge profit boon for PGI.  No question whatsoever.  Its just they rather hold out for one guy who will drop  a time instead of  thatll drop .  Its dumb.The problem with FP is its the wild west and its easy to get greedy even if it bites both parties in the end.  People are still figuring out whatll work and we are moving towards a new era for indie game makers modders and crowd funding that is really experimental.

You mean it translates exactly???? You suck Sand!But waittheres more.....Never actually holds the same meaning in both languages. So wheres the miscommunication?Theres a clause in HOW the word never is used when speaking PGInese. Essentially it means never for THAT position at the time. Its a much more fluid word in PGInese. See they never introduced a feature that they said was never going to be introduced until after they changed their position. You MUST understand that PGInese is based on a very fluid and ancient language.Every word in PGInese is actually a derivative of the words cashgrab money and whale.In order to understand PGInese at its core it is very important to understand that every word can and does have  different meanings depending on whether its being used in the masculine form feminine form or money form.So you can clearly see again that it was purely your fault for not understanding that the word never in PGInese only refers to that specific position at the time it was said. ,mwo,ckehzfb,11,t5_2t1w0

Asymetrical matches that can be balanced even with Clantech.  Been saying this forever.  It doesnt lose ANYTHING from the current system while its true you may have super heavy matches if a team gets a light mech or poor quality T mech it wont hurt it very much because it leave more BV to spend elsewhere.As a side note Ive never recommended using the TT stats for this and yes BV was massively improved on TT since the original version of it.,mwo,ckgrpoe,1,t5_2t1w0

2487887,0,t3_2o181f, Victor Morson feels a great disturbance in the force like someone is attempting to defend Ghost Heat on rmwo Greetings new player.  As someone who played before and after Ghost Heat let me outline the essential problems with it which are vast before I go into the biggest problem of all The vast majority of weapons did not need to be added to the list.  Once upon a time Quad Large Lasers or  AC were completely viable builds.   Medlaser Swaybacks were a niche mech as well fitting well into competitive drops when you just used one or two as support.  They had roles.  They added strategy.  They were murdered by Ghost Heat for no reason. There is absolutely no UI ingame that tells you when its safe to fire.  If one were to run an optimal  PPC build they would need to use keyboard macros to time the shots precisely on a . second delay.  With some weapons its not a big deal and others x AC it can literally fry you on the spot which leads to.. ..the completely erratic levels of heatscale that require reading a spreadsheet on smurfys to even begin to grasp.  For example theres nothing anywhere ingame that indicates that firing a second AC will cause HUGE heat spikes and someone using  LRMs might not even realize they are BEING heattaxed.  Its as if PGI has gone completely out of their way to keep it hidden from the enduser meaning if you dont frequent forums on it you are SOL.  Thats poor design. Missiles link illogically.  For a while the LRM went outside of linking with the  amp  but Ive heard thats changed yet the LRM can still link  launchers and not  so I think if you only run  launchers youll be alright and  yeah. If I run  s and a  for  missiles I eat the heat of  s but if I run  s I dont?  WTF? It shouldnt be unnecessary because using different combination of weapons should be balanced to be a desirable thing.  In an ideal world a mech running  PPCs should be as effective roughly as people running mixed load outs with their own sets of advantages and disadvantages.  This is achieved through actually fixing the guns.  Without this people will simply find the biggest guns with the best synergy and pair them on any mech that can deadside weapons.The week Ghost Heat showed up people ignoring it utterly dominated the Battlefield until the PPC heat was adjusted separately.  Fixing the PPCs heat fixed the PPC amounts carried not Ghost Heat.And now the biggest issue   It absolutely does not impact alphas pinpoint damage or anything else.  Ultimately people have continued to get around Ghost Heat and produce huge alphas  bigger than would be possible with many demonized boats  just by mixing weapons with high synergy.  What it did do again is basically force people to use that one high synergy weapon load out to be competitive while killing all kinds of alternate play styles and builds that were effective counters.  PPC  Gauss  AC sniping got so much worse after Ghost Heat because counters to those builds were all wiped out by it.  Long story short PPCs should be hot enough that anyone foolish enough to fire  is going to fry.  Ghost Heat shouldnt be necessary for that.  There are many iconic cannon mechs that carry  PPCs and theres no reason they should be punished for it.  ED  The PPC needs a revisiting too but thats a whole other ballgame  They should be made to work within the mech ecosystem.Nothing limited build creativity more and killed more play styles in the entire history of MWO than Ghost Heat by a mile.  I am eagerly awaiting the meeting where its removal and possible replacement is discussed.  Since Ghost Heat is entirely ineffective at stopping pinpoint alphas or fixing the sniper power levels and there were hundreds of superior suggestions this should be done.Long story short  This is why I keep saying Paul should not return to anything to do with design once hes done with CW.  Russ has started to turned this ship around simply by listening occasionally responding and not purposely trolling or inciting anger with inflammatory hit amp runs.,mwo,cmjazqn,6,t5_2t1w0

3503598,0,t3_30d7h2,Had to find my post from the other day on this subject this is what I wrote.  You cant try to learn everything at once so I tried to break it down into steps.Focus on staying with your group and staying alive first and foremost.  Thats it just try to stay alive as long as possible is the main goal.  You can combine with step two but really try to stay alive by sticking with your group and using cover.  Target enemies take shots as they come but stay alive.Then focus on taking those potshots that come up as you are doing this. Dont focus on kills or even damage. Maybe your missed shot made a dude retreat back into cover. Its a win!Start paying attention to your own armor display and using torso twisting and more precise positioning within your teams deathball or cover to spread damage amongst all your components helping you stay alive even longer.Now that you can stay alive and spread damage start paying attention to how you are doing relative to your team. Time to start intentionally taking fire. The same way you can spread damage among your components to avoid having your weapons blown off and becoming ineffective you can present yourself as another target for the enemy helping spread damage amongst your team so that others dont get picked off as fast. Preserve your whole teams effectiveness.Finally applying those lessons in reverse to the enemy team. Using targeting info and overlays to target the most damaged parts of the most damaged mechs to reduce their effectiveness as quickly as possible.Also to level your mechs as fast as possible to elite and get double basics you want to always be targetingspotting and always bring a UAV MC version if you want to save cbills but thats probably not a popular opinion. Using a UAV well will give you more XP also. Premium time too but you probably will want to get a better sense of if the game is for you before spending real money.At first though remember that staying alive is always priority number one.  You cant do damage if youre dead.,mwo,cprmvcj,2,t5_2t1w0

They may apply rules unevenly and retroactively enforce rules after they decide they dont like a user but that isnt baiting.Steam on the other hand is far more likely to evenly enforce the rules.  Which is going to get people banned sooner than they think.  Some on the other aisle from here are going to get a suprise when they find the rules being enforced equally and get a ban themselves.

The real advantage of the Jager is the high arms art cockpit level meaning you can peek over a hill and only have a fraction of your mech exposed. For energy mechs Battlemasters Banshees and Grasshoppers are your better bets. Otherwise Raven L is GREAT with x ERLL and ECM to hide your position move fast and again have high mounts or a Cicada M with x ERPPC and ECM for the same role. ,mwo,cypfil4,2,t5_2t1w0

Not sure if you are aware but you can change weapons groups during a match using the Arrow keys for moving the selected weapon and group and the Right CTRL to enabledisable them.

6438647,0,t3_43sdtz,What you need is a highDPS mech. Laser Vomit is great for focusing damage and taking out someone fast but you tend to have to cool down for a bit which decreases your overall damage score. This isnt to say you cant break K damage with a laser heavy build but it is easier with ballistics.Something like  ACs have huge DPS and can be fired pretty much continuously without any heat buildup. This is where the luck comes in since if you have accessibility to targets for the entire match and dont get focused down yourself breaking  damage is definitely possible.On the IS side a Mauler with x AC King Crab with x UAC Banshee with xAC  x ML are all great contenders to hit K. Jagermech or CTFIM with x UAC can also do well though the JM is a bit fragile and the CTF has low arms which make them  harder. On the Clan side a Direwolf with whatever ballistic configuration you can cram in can do it as well. Just make sure to bring enough ammo.You can also check out the individual mech pages at Mechspecs.com where people make up  Damage clubs and see what builds are popular.,mwo,czlam8l,3,t5_2t1w0

6521603,0,t3_44ysj2,The skills system which is way overdue for an overhaul has always been a bit tricky to understand.  There are two separate requirements depending on whether you want to unlock Elite skills or Master skills i.e. the extra module slot.. To unlock Elite skills you must first unlock all basic skills for at least  variants of that chassis.  And yes you must purchase those variants before you can unlock their skills.  If youve got gobs and gobs of GXP though you dont necessarily have to play them  you could feasibly use GXP to unlock the basic skills and then sell the mechs you dont want.  Example If you want to unlock Elite skills for your Jenner Oxide you must first fully unlock all basics for at least three Jenner variants e.g. JRF JRO JRD.. Mastery is slightly different.  You must unlock all Elite skills for at least  mechs of the same weight class e.g. light medium heavy assault.  You could elite  Ravens for example or you could mix em up by eliting any  light variants RVNL JRF FSS.,mwo,cztvvhs,4,t5_2t1w0

7060195,0,t3_4cb7fq,Firstly Trial of Entrances and Trial of Positions follow the Zelbrigan rules. Might want to become familiar with those. The rules might vary from one clan to another however.With the above in mind building for v is different than building for PUG drops. Mainly in the fact that you dont need quite as much ammunition in a v situation. Thusly a Mechwarrior can increase his chances significantly by dropping ammo and adding more weapons  heatsinks instead.Beyond that the basics of Torso twisting should be your primary focus. Ask their trainees to turn and twists their torsos not to avoid damage a huge misconception on your CT but to spread it relatively evenly accross all your torsos.One other thing that should be mentioned and this applies to all mechs as well is the fact that you should always aim with your torso and not your legs. By that I mean you should avoid having to turn your whole mech to aim as much as possible. That means giving your torso extra breathing room when engaging. Also many new players have Arm Lock enabled by default. One thing that many older players do is they have Arm Lock hold the button down not the toggle bound to a key that they press shortly before firing. Learning to lock  unlock your arms as needed is a pretty useful skill to learn.,mwo,d1gmtn8,6,t5_2t1w0

7976505,0,t3_4oh0ay,If you set your sights on playing smaller faster mechs you can get some of the more meta builds just with the cadet bonuses off playing your first  games with trial mechs. If you think bigger is better and want to drop your cash on an Atlas or something like that its going to cost you your whole cadet bonus to get it but you could probably pick up three Blackjacks to go for mastery or something like that for the same price.The only aspect where it becomes remotely pay to win is that a few of the meta mechs are hero mechs that are bought with either MC or cash. Theyre definitely not required mechs but a few like from memory the hero Blackjack the Jester Misery and a few others are tier  mechs you can just drop cash on but still need to spend a chunk of ingame cash to mod them since you usually need to replace the engine and weapons with a more efficient loadoutI have only ever played solo and I have a decent time with it though sometimes you will get tossed into a crap group but at least the rounds dont last agesFor the difficulty curve if you can learn quickly not to be impatient and not to rush off by yourself and can quickly work out how to back other players up and control your aim to not waste shots youll do fine quickly. The game isnt really that hard to play though once your skill level increases youll see some pretty godlike shenanigans.,mwo,d4cmv4p,3,t5_2t1w0
8007524,0,t1_d4g2yc7,Well like I said Im not saying theyre giving a good deal in most areas. Just saying their subscription model is a fairly typical one mostly referring to it ticking down while youre offline.As to the value of things... Im not sure how I feel. If you play events you stand to get a lot for free. Trinkets paints premium time and most importantly mechbays. And all but hero mechs are free eventually.So to say  doesnt get you much is true... But only to a point since all of the game content will be free eventually the mech the maps the modules etc  everything you need to actually play. Its not like theyre selling DLCs that are overpriced where you literally cant get access to the content without overpaying.  All theyre selling is early access trivial decorations and convenience premium time.Where I do agree with you is it feels like overpaying just to get premium content. Id probably sub for  a month to get early access a few trinkets and premium time. But they wouldnt make as much... Unless it meant more people were willing to pay.Im not sure if theyve actually tried to figure out what people would do.,mwo,d4g4dd8,3,t5_2t1w0

8187965,0,t3_4rfn6o,One more piece of advice regarding choosing Mechs.  Eventually youll want to dip your toes into the faction warfare side of the game if you havent already done so.With that in mind  Id suggest the Griffin mastery bundle also if you are looking to spend MCs.  The Sparky is a decent laser vomit hero but the Mech youd really be getting there is the GRFN which is a great Mech for scouting games.Youd also want to work on assembling a passable drop deck for both Inner Sphere and Clan depending on where you wind up going unit wise or faction wise.Since you would have the Thunderbolt already from the heavy Steam sale pack  if you had two Warhammers a Thunderbolt and a Blackjack for a total of  tons  at the current weight limits youd have a fairly versatile drop deck.  be aware sometimes in the past this tonnage limit has been changed either up or down depending on whether balance has swung too far in one factions favour or notFor Clan side  again building on what you currently own  you could run two Timber Wolves leaving you  tons to play with across  more Mechs.  Id be suggesting an Arctic Cheetah as your preferred clan light leaving you up to  tons for your last Mech.  Hellbringer or Ebon Jaguar would be the favoured suggestion.,mwo,d511pv2,2,t5_2t1w0

11772697,0,t3_67zgdu,Is it a macro or just chain fire?As for dealing with them Im not a particularly experienced player but Id suggest using lots of cover and trying to change position a lot so that you can get off a shot and limit face time with them. Also if they are chain firing like that its more for suppression than anything. Generally they would do more damage and more targetted damage to your components if they were using alpha strikes or at least firing whole groups at a time. You can spread out the damage a lot more and maybe get some good trades if youre quick and dont pop out of cover where they expect you to.If youre a brawler though I dunno theres much to do for it other than try to flank them. Maybe try to figure out if you can out circle them or if you can corner poke better than they can or something. You might also be able to explode their ammo which a lot of players pack into the legs.,mwo,dgugv5w,6,t5_2t1w0
