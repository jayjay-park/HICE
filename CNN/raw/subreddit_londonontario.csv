3350438,0,t1_cpa643a,Rental income is considered differently by different banks. Typically they use  of your rental income to be counted towards your total income. Some companies will do  or full amounts rare but happens. They will then add it onto your work income and see if you qualify. It is quite possible to do it without your parents help. Banks are looking for sustainability so if the property can cover itself even if you are unemployed with past rental history or new leases etc... then you have a stronger case. All my properties are purchased based on my rental income.One other thing to note I get the feeling that you dont have a property picked out yet and is looking for a preapproval type arrangement with mortgage brokers. Contrary to what all the mortgage brokers will tell you THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PREAPPROVAL. They will however look at your profile and determine what you could potentially do but no guarantees. Your best route would be to speak with a mortgage broker to build a relationship then start looking for properties. Once you have a property picked out you can send it off to your mortgage broker to see if its feasible and go from there.,londonontario,cpa6axu,1,t5_2rds8

3419610,0,t1_cpi1gb2,I completely agree it was my fault I hadnt put snows on yet. I wasnt blaming anyone else. Ironically I had snows put on the next day. The road was a kmh zone and I went through the light at kmh. I remember speeding up after deciding I couldnt stop so I think I mustve been going kmh. I judged that was an appropriate speed for the conditions. Maybe I was wrong. As for the time the light had been red for . seconds when I ran it. The yellow had been quite short though.All in all its a pretty iffy situation. While yes I shouldve had snows on and since I didnt maybe I should have been driving even slower it still doesnt change the fact that the camera takes nothing into account snow on the ground and the size on the fine. I dont think that what I did deserved a  fine but Im quite biased. As I said above countdown timers are a much better idea IMO. If you know the time left till the light changes then you can base your driving on that.,londonontario,cpi26lj,3,t5_2rds8

There is a difference between being stopped and parked hence why there are No Stopping zones and No Parking zones on streets. You can stop a car but not be deemed to have parked it.  This would be the case if you pulled up on a street and unloaded passengers or other stuff.In my opinion when it comes to parking at a meter getting out of the car and paying the meter in a prompt manner is all part of the unloading process and tolerances should be offered for that.  However if you are stopped but not in the process of unloading the car promptly then you are parked and need to pay.I would imagine this is how the courts would view it.  If the attendant was issuing tickets the moment people pulled into a spot without an opportunity to pay for the spot that wouldnt be acceptable.

7792879,0,t3_4m1kms,I had a similar thing happen to me but I was the one being pulled over. I was driving through an intersection and the light turned yellow just before I entered the intersection. As I was driving through to the other side the light turned red and the person waiting to turn left tried to turn but couldnt because I was finishing driving through. The person trying to turn left was a cop and he turned his lights on immediately did a uturn in the middle of the intersection and pulled me over.     He said I drove through a red and I told him that it was still yellow when I entered the intersection. He told me that it didnt matter and that it was the same offence which I replied that I was under the impression that yellow means stop unless it is not safe to do so. It would not have been safe for me to slam on the brakes as I probably would have ended up stopping in the middle of the intersection. He was pretty rude about it probably mad because I made him look bad by forcing him to turn after it had already turned red... but thats just the game you play when you wait in the middle of the intersection to turn left Mr. Officer.     I was given a warning but he told me that if I get caught going through a yellow again that I would get a ticket. For a while after that incident I would instinctually slam my brakes on when I saw the lights turn yellow because I was so worried about getting pulled over but turns out thats really unsafe!  ,londonontario,d3rz76o,3,t5_2rds8

All the page one stuff is basically quotes from the union leader.  Admittedly the RNAO is not officially a union but for all intents and purposes it is.This article should have a disclaimer about the source.  Not characterizing the opening statement leads the reader to believe it is all fact.something like The RNAO whose purpose is to promote RNs and keep as many employed as possible has come out in opposition of a report that says we can get by with less RNs.If a president of an organization calls a vice president into hisher  office and says youve publicly disagreed with me.  I kinda need your support if we are to work as an executive team.  If you are not going to support me Ill have to remove you from the post.  This is not a democracy.  I am the president and we have to run things my way.

9533116,0,t3_5bcew8,In  I had a stalker. He wasnt too invasive overall but one night he found me when I wasnt at home studying and followed me screaming at me after I ran for it when he went to the bathroom. I went to a gas station to hide out and call a friend for a ride and he ended up fighting one of the employees to try and get inside. They got him away from the door when my friend came but he tried to fight his way into our car. Id literally never talked to the guy before.  Before this point hed sent me a few really creepy emails that I never responded to but that was it. So anyways I got home and called the cops.  The officer came over to take my story. But the whole time the officer was asking me really awkward questions and wouldnt believe me when I said Id never talked to the guy. But you must have dated him in the past?You probably had sex with him before right? Are you sure you didnt have sex with him? Because thats usually why this happens. Are you sure? Maybe you were drunk and dont remember sleeping with him? You must have lived together? What about your past dates? So how many times have you slept with him?He wouldnt even listen to my story he just kept interrupting me asking me about our history. At one point he walked into the entry way and looked at my shoes and pointed at my big tall stiletto boots and made some comment about how those are what hookers wear so maybe he was a client. Anyways entire thing was fucked. They told me to call if he contacts me again.  So I called the cops again the next time the guy emailed me and said he was coming to find me and they told me its not worth thier time because weekends are busy and that theyll only do something after he shows up and is aggressive. Sorry you had to deal with this  Campus police were much more supportive for me but they cant do much. ,londonontario,d9o5mze,1,t5_2rds8

My French was the deciding factor hiring me onto my second internship I had in university.  Popularity has exploded though since Ive been through it now that everyones heard how great it is.  There are more schools available now but popularity keeps going up so it may be difficult to get in.  Also I may just be biased but having gone through the Catholic board with FI it seemed worlds better than what was offered by the public board especially for the high school portion.

There was a derelict barn with a proper noose hanging from the rafters. Wed sneak onto the property at night to watch the drivein movies at the Twilight Cinema for free. London has a sordid history with the far right. I went to Central in the mid eighties and there were quite a few neoNazi skinheads hanging around downtown all the time. London Chinese Cafe on Dundas St. would be packed with  or  racist skinheads and about thirty or forty punks and arts kids. Youd see racist pamphlets posted around town and the odd person wearing racist tshirts as skinheads and the organized far right groups behind them were actively recruiting in those days. A few brawls broke out between some of the athletic students of Central and the skinheads who were mostly well into their s. The older brother of a friend of mine  now a London PD  knocked out the largest skinhead a giant lummox of about  right in front of city hall.

10819633,0,t3_5uoyz3,A few years ago I had a conversation with someone who knows him well and said that the man has an unbelievable ego. For example the person told me when he goes out to a restaurant he preps the people hes with to shout out his name and clap when he comes in thus drawing attention to him from other patrons and creating the appearance that hes Mr. Popularity. I took that with a grain of salt having smarmy bus stop signs RIP? doesnt mean the guys that obnoxious.However over the past few years I have witnessed this restaurant spectacle myself. At several restaurants all quite different from each other. The most notable occasion was at Symposium about a year ago. He was at a table and then he quietly got up and left... About a minute later he returned and the whole table was shouting Oh its George! George! Hi! and clapping etc. So of course all eyes in the restaurant turn to him and hes waving like Queen Elizabeth to a crowd. I guess thats an alternate form for advertising for when the bus stop signs just dont cut it.Im curious if anyone else has witnessed this?,londonontario,ddvyw04,20,t5_2rds8

10974608,0,t3_5vy3pa,Hes a foster home ? for one of the cat rescue groups always touted as an amazing person by rescue folks from my experience. I worked at a vet clinic they used for awhile the cats never came in for routine care spread parasites and illnesses between each other as they were always together hethey basically did the bare minimum in terms of health care for the cats. Not the worst but not as great as everyone makes him seem. Nice guy though. Back when they were changing the pet by laws he was brought up at the meetings quite frequently. The cityACC seemingly turned a blind eye to it as its a foster home. At the time the by law was  cats per adult per dwelling  if you had  people living there you could have  cats. Its been changed to something like  cats if theyre all spayedneutered and you have no dogs. Foster pets are unlimited which seems like a terrible idea given the number of people that will take on too many animals that they cant properly take care of. ,londonontario,debz9c5,1,t5_2rds8

With DSL you end up with  of the available wire bandwidth available for your use. With cable you share the bandwidth with everyone else on the line.In reality though coaxial cable has such a superior bandwidth compared to twisted pair copper that it just doesnt matter your speed cap andor the node uplink capacity are main limits and both technologies have those.VDSL has a bandwidth limit of Mbps within m of the node. DOCSIS . cable has a permodem limit of .Gbps with a maximum aggregate data rate of over Gbps for all users on the line. So in other words for every VDSL customer on a single line a max capacity cable can support more than  customers at the same capacity on a single line.Bells cable uses a shared line is completely moot marketing hogwash.
