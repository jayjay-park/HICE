5083391,0,t3_3igr51,I like this show however at times there are huge plot holes that never get filled. And at other times the show gets pretty schizophrenic. For example Campbell the Governor was a huge part of season . One of the main characters. In season  he is nowhere to be found. No explanation nothing. Just poof. ,Hell_On_Wheels,cuyqq7y,3,t5_2slbb
