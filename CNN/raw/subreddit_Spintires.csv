1222888,0,t3_282es2,Put some weight over the back tires with chains and it works pretty well. Yeah its no x but I got a half full cistern through  river crossings without using the winch.

2597437,0,t3_2pksto,Uhg. This is bad news. Touched up version of the translation thanks to oovee forum user Quantifier.I really hope we get official word from the oovee forum moderators Flanna and Hein soon. Hein and Flanna seem to not be sure about the news yet and Flanna has said he is hearing something different from oovee. So hopefully its not the end of spintires. If Oovee screwed with Pavel they will have a tainted name in the business for sure.gtSad news ... just seemed like the development process started I almost finished my map and tools to develop mods free upgrade ... as our Englishmen from oovee together with the loot disappeared. What infuriates even more is the fact that my posts are removed from the official Englishlanguage forum. gtI dont have permissions to upload the update to Steam. So now Ill complete and release map editor in the version it is now and this will be end of Spintires.  gtIn general it is all strongly reminiscent of the film Brother  Well see maybe I will do another game about trucks on similar technology. gtPavel ZagrebelnyjOfficial Oovee UPDATEThanks to uJinassi for bringing this to my attention. Well looks like we jumped the gun. Please take the time to read the official Oovee statement,Spintires,cmxmega,5,t5_2xeon

4835355,0,t1_cu3wzum,There is a way using a hex editor that PressureLine was telling us but he didnt describe in enough detail for how to do it. He did say something about using the same amount of letters as what is there already but I couldnt figure it out myself as Im not very good with a hex editor. But if you have the combine tools you should have the default maps from that version as well and would be able to change the default vehicles in those maps just not the newer versions because you need the working files to make any changes to them.,Spintires,cu419xq,1,t5_2xeon

5517893,0,t3_3qmcyf,I got the game this week out of the humblebundle.I played for  hours yesterday on the coast map and i first uncloaked everything and wanted to start driving lumber around and unlock the garages.Unfortunately i got stuck pretty hard with the C and none of the cars i unlocked could pull it out.I looked up some tutorials and seen full maps with legends and there were D and E class marked on coast.So i drove around for over an hour at the marked spots and was pretty disappointed i couldnt find them.I thought some bug occured i looked up patch changelogs and everything but nowhere on the web something like that was mentioned. I started a new game deinstalledinstalled the game completely still no DE class.Than in this thread thanks folks i found the answer.I think it is damn unfair from the devs not to make the maps harder im fine with that except the B is darn useless that they nowhere wrote this down and because of that i lost my savegame and had no chance of rescuing my C which is also pretty useless with these roadtires.So i question myself why do they take these trucks off the maps? Would be pretty helpful for a beginner like my to get stucked vehicles on the road again.Otherwise i have pretty good fun with this game played the techdemo years ago and was really hyped.I guess the trial and error increases very hard with the recent update.,Spintires,cwgylmj,3,t5_2xeon
5622471,0,t1_cwu0eqe,well thats a steam problem then when you use the workshop via steam its working. there arent any more mods than the  official ones yet because the official truck editor isnt released as soon as that is implemented the workshop will probably be flooded ,Spintires,cwu0rpu,2,t5_2xeon
