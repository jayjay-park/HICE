3723246,0,t3_331r3q,Time  Its official hes playing Minecraft. .k viewers at the moment. Minutes in EDIT .k viewers already has k subscribers. EDIT Adding a time marker just so people can see how fast its changing. .k viewers hes switched over to GTA V for Xbox One were constantly hearing AW SHIT from Im on a Boat? for new donations and Waluigi talking for a new subscriber. Saw in chat double checked hes the th Top Channel on Twitch right now. EDIT .k viewers apparently we broke the stream tip donation button? Im new at Twitch only ever watched Ray and like the first month of TwitchPlaysPokemon so Im still figuring out how it all works. Just saw a . donation which reminds me that they commented that PayPal is acting funny from the flood of donations totally awesome that hes got Tina there for technical backup haha EDIT .k viewers TOP  LIVE CHANNEL! Apparently minimum donation is set to  logic being if you dont have  to spare you probably need it more also to counteract . donations immediatley saw a donation for . right after they got done saying that it was pretty funny. EDIT  from Rebeliz I think hard to catch it going by . from someone next Boob lol Tina pointed out a donation from someone called TRex and Ray left to give us chair cam so he can breath and not cry I think weve overwhelmed him. Which is a good thing for getting started isnt it? D Rays mom is watching and is super proud EDIT k viewers I heard k followers bouncing between  and  for Top Streams you know more general first official full time stream is awesome kinda stuff. D DonationSub notification just DO NOT STOP. EDIT Apparently the donation I missed at the  was a separate  donation. How cool is that? Holding steady at k viewers top  of Twitch. Getting ready to play Fibbage with fans. k people competing for like  spots? lol I tried to join room was full. Oh well fun to get to try to join you know? EDIT Still playing Fibbage. Nothing new and exciting to report other than Ray is off to a great start. Got shit I have to do unfortunately so I cant keep up the unnecessary play by play haha.,brownman,cqgocml,12,t5_2uzre

3994054,0,t1_crbircq,No im mad at twitch for a valid reason. Putting something out that is fucking with peoples viewing quality for what les lag between our chat and what hes sees on his chat. Im watching the gameplay not the chat. I dont want a chat feature to fuck with my viewing enjoyment at all. Especialy if i dont use the chat.,brownman,crbk096,1,t5_2uzre

4350003,0,t3_3apeeo,I only watch the GTA and Minecraft Lets Plays if its Geoff Jack Ryan Gavin and Michael. Throwing new people in an expecting there to be a connection is unrealistic. The comedy in the videos comes from knowing each other so well. Ray I think one thing that wouldve killed playing GTA that much was that Ryan andor Gavin would fuck up the   minute prep time. Was that part of it? ,brownman,csfz7a1,1,t5_2uzre

4489838,0,t3_3clcmi,gt Subscriber Only streams.Is the entire stream subonly as in nonsubs cant even watch you play? Because I think thats pretty dumb. If its just subonly chat thats fine by me I tend to lurk a lot anyways.,brownman,cswlt06,1,t5_2uzre
4489946,0,t3_3clcmi,Maybe instead of subscriber only streams make it a public stream but sub only chat as you said and have a weekly subscriber play date. All the subs vote on a game and you play that for awhile as your stream. I think its a great way to get more subscribers. ,brownman,cswmal9,1,t5_2uzre
