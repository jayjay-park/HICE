541555,0,t1_cg1tjfm,On the Playstation  the button was the Circle button. Im sure it wouldnt be difficult to reserve some realestate on the pad for this feature. Pressing the trackpad could work fairly well I think.,hhour,cg1txpk,1,t5_2xkkm

2068307,0,t1_cl2jsxm,That doesnt make any sense. Everyone is going to strafe to try and avoid getting shot in the head. If you stand still to try and lineup a shot you will get killed.Just because a mouse is precise doesnt mean its easy to use. There is a huge learning curve with mice.,hhour,cl2q6wf,1,t5_2xkkm

3213687,0,t3_2wt694,Knowing the development cycle of other Early Access games on PC with even more resources I would optimistically say  years.Once the game is released on Steam tons of effort will be going into fixing bugs etc. they dont really have a choice in this regard. In order to keep making money from the Steam release they gotta answer the customers.If this game somehow blows up and does great on EA the outlook could be better. They might get an investor. Depends on the reception. Steam reviewers are harsh as hell and once you get a rep for being a studio that doesnt fix bugs and hackers its really hard to get rid of it. Releasing on PC isnt like releasing to the moron  year old market on playstation that buys broken COD games year after year.,hhour,cov3lpi,1,t5_2xkkm
3607848,0,t1_cq3ioo0,To each his own I suppose but when you start adding things like sprint and such the SOCOM gameplay gets lost in a buch of COD type features. The reason I always liked SOCOM was because of that specific gameplay. ,hhour,cq3iraz,3,t5_2xkkm

You can check the steamspy and see the amount of unique users per day I can see a diff set of  out of that  every week plus a couple new guys. No one plays that consistently even I dont for various reasons including lack of content and life shit.
