Possible values are usedonly usedbutkeepunused and all.     usedonly installs only explicitly used packages and uninstall any     unused packages as well as their unused dependencies.     usedbutkeepunused installs only the used packages but wont uninstall     them if they become unused. all installs all packages supported by     Spacemacs and never uninstall them. default is usedonly    dotspacemacsinstallpackages usedbutkeepunusedIve set mine to keep unused packages. I have a couple of packages loaded via dotspacemacsadditionalpackages and used in my config that for some reason Im yet to fathom keep getting deleted.,spacemacs,df8l8o8,1,t5_37w2j
