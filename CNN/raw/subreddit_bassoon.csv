472968,0,t1_cftpls5,I honestly havent used them in years. I just know that when I was learning in high school Id buy  Forrests reeds and only get one or two that functioned. With jones I never had an issue. Maybe theyve improved!,bassoon,cfu1217,1,t5_2sc37

2663271,0,t1_cn0z2yx,Hi! Congrats on such a cool part. I would suggest beginning work right away. The contra part on Beethoven  is the most standard excerpt asked on auditions. Its extremely difficult to play let alone make it sound good. I think its awesome youre going to tackle this challenge. Start playing it slowly get the notes in tune. I agree with TJ youre being thrown into a shark tank D Good luck!!!,bassoon,cn67sq2,1,t5_2sc37
2972303,0,t3_2u3pry,If you absolutely need a cheat try tapping the A flick key. The only time Ive ever felt the need to do this was a fast slurred passage in Mahler  though so if its high school students asking then the other two are probably right that you shouldnt need any trick for it.,bassoon,co5ysi6,1,t5_2sc37

3541077,0,t1_cpvrbxb,Yep I have issue too with that. What about contemporary as written by someone who is our contemporary?So contemporary written bassoon solo or maybe duets for beginners.Id like to have a good idea of what have been written for beginners. I can not find much at the moment. Where should I look?,bassoon,cpvwlne,1,t5_2sc37

4199872,0,t3_38wtio,Its always a good habit to buy your solo piece originals because that way if need be you have your piano part as well. search imslp.org to find anything you might like. Im not sure what someone your age will be able to play,bassoon,cryz9pn,1,t5_2sc37

5250784,0,t3_3mlt94,Milde studies are always a work in progress and I feel I never perfect them. I play them as eighth notes with a metronome around  BPM at first until I am able to speed it up. My studio teacher is never harsh on me about Milde studies. There is a difference between not practicing  where your fingers will be frantically trying to find the notes and practicing something difficult that you need more time on. Im on number  now and I started number  my junior year of high school Im a junior in college now. I take my time get a good grasp and technique down so that when I return to studies I will have laid down the foundation. Milde studies have taught me so much  take your time and try not to get too frustrated !,bassoon,cviwppq,1,t5_2sc37

8641666,0,t1_d6l8mia,I can vouch for this hard. This is where i currently study and am also McGoverns TA. Feel free to message if you want to learn more about the University.edit Conducting program here is amazing. I plan on my cognate to be in conducting. Schleicher is wonderful studied with Pierre Boulez who makes the University of Illinois Symphony sound stellar. Recently they hired a new director of bands named Stephen Peterson who is highly regarded in the band world. His rehearsals with the Wind Symphony are very rewarding!,bassoon,d6ltgc8,1,t5_2sc37
8834536,0,t1_d79r9za,Better cane better build quality handmade reeds from trained bassoonists have allaround finer finesse than those Jones reeds you find at your local music store. Working with one of these trained people can help you determine exactly how thick or thin your reed needs to be. Id recommend contacting a nearby universitys bassoon professor or orchestral bassoonist and letting them know your situation. However if you live in an area without such assets I recommend checking out one of the big double reed websites and seeing their reed selections.,bassoon,d79scax,2,t5_2sc37
