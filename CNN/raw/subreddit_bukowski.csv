1006872,0,t3_25mia1,Some claim that James Joyces Ulysses is the greatest novel ever crafted by a human hand. I found the vast majority of it opaque impenetrable and worse still boring. I find none of that in Buks work. Though afaic his poetry can be a bit tedious. What I mean to say is Opinions are like assholes everyone has one. If Bukowski doesnt do it for you he doesnt do it for you. It doesnt make your friends wrong or you right. It just means you have different tastes. Personally I think hes one of the greatest authors of th century American Literature. Others would argue against that. So it goes.,bukowski,chiqmbu,8,t5_2ql0j
4442663,0,t3_3bnjp3,People give me shit for loving Buk all the time. Read women he treated his mates that way because genuine love between a man and woman was up until that point a foreign concept to him not because he hated women.He was a very flawed man searching desperately for something he barely understood. I and many other people can relate to that. Sure he probably didnt treat women very well but did he even treat anyone that well? Did he treat himself that well? Didnt he beat the shit out of a good friend and kick him out of his apartment at the end of Factotum?If you focus on Buks mistreatment of women you are missing the point of this beatifully tragic hero.,bukowski,csqoliy,1,t5_2ql0j

8048979,0,t1_d4jxh3r,Me too! Junky by William S. Burroughs has a pretty good description of withdrawals If I remember correctly. He hits the booze so hard while trying to quit heroin that he develops jaundice. Its strange how Hollywood seems to steer clear of realistically portraying withdrawals. A character will say ok Im quitting cold turkey! and they experience a little discomfort like sweating but then they pop a Valium and all is better. They never get into the anxiety fear hallucinations palpitations etc.,bukowski,d4ks47b,1,t5_2ql0j
8384294,0,t1_d5pizcc,I didnt really care for Pulp but I might have been too hard on it. Hollywood was enjoyable all the fake names for real people were pretty fun and watching the film Barfly afterwards was cool. But I wouldnt say that either are up among his best.,bukowski,d5pl2s6,1,t5_2ql0j
