I keep telling myself that one of these years I need to not be the only Austinite on my team but alas most of my team isnt even in the US. ,GISHWHES,cjj6scf,2,t5_2usmg
1650177,0,t1_cjmrxsk,Aww. I sent an email and basically said I know this sounds insane... but please bare with me as I explain why I need to use a carrier pigeon haha. The gentleman did all the handling for us and seemed pretty pleased that people were showing interest in pigeons! He shared the history and how some companies still use carrier pigeons today in the mountains where cell service is spotty. ,GISHWHES,cjn62i6,2,t5_2usmg

8532557,0,t3_4wjrwy,This was our first year and it was really cool.  We got roped in my a gisher who went to our room party at Emerald City Comic Con.  I think it was a lot more fun and more involved than people expected.  Many folks are talking about taking the week off next year.My favorites this year were probably rainbow smile cosplay a thunderstorm and mundane superheroes,GISHWHES,d684ujv,4,t5_2usmg
