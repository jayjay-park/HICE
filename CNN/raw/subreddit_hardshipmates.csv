1909673,0,t3_2fz4gw,you cant trust the internet. you cant trust anything really. all you can truly trust is yourself. to overcome you must first understand your mind is your reality. it is YOU and the more of you you explore the more of you you will understand. you have the key to open any doors to your mind that key is twosided . realization . acceptancedepression is a mental tumor it grows in the mind and feeds off your fear. its an infection of your thoughts. a paralyzing mental barrier. the only one who CAN do something real to change it is YOU.how do you cope? forget about that. coping is creepy. its a bandaid. to fight depression you must strike it at its source.where does it stem from? what is the root cause? once you find it grab ahold of it. dont let it go until youve got a hold of it completely. once youve yanked it out from the depths of your mind let it go. let it dissolve out of existence,hardshipmates,ckjaxjd,1,t5_2sz0o

9460584,0,t1_d8lxrp7,Hi I know this is really late but I wanted to say thank you.  Your response meant a lot to me.  I got myself to my dr and my new therapist and doc tried me on a new med and OMG ITS WORKING.  Im still exhausted and overwhelmed but I am able to get up and move and take those baby steps like you talked about.  So thats where Im at now theres still a mountain in front of me but I can see where I can move a boulder here or there and make a start.My husband is in a wheelchair and has brain damage.  Insurance wont cover any more in home care.  Yay America.Hearing that the intrusive suicidal thoughts are normal really helped.  Just getting a response at all helped.  Thank you internet strangerfriend.,hardshipmates,d9f72ir,2,t5_2sz0o
