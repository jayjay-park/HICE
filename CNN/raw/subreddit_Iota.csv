11514904,0,t1_dg1238f,The responses so far have very good. Ill toss a few more things out there as well.gt Do I need relatively advanced expertise to understand what this does? If not what exactly does this do with the previous scenario in mind? What problem does it solve?Youve heard the buzzwords block chains bitcoin no intermediary and peertopeer. These were most likely used in the context of transferring value or storing wealth since thats the problem that bitcoin tries to solve. Most all? of the problems that bitcoin faces today most importantly it always has a limit on the transactions it can support per second  this is called lacking scalability are due to the actual software protocol that it runs on called a block chain. As it turns out block chains have some very big limitations which pose a bunch of problems going forward. IOTA uses a different software protocol called the Tangle. This is a fundamentally different way of solving the problems that bitcoin originally set out to tackle. The easiest ELI way of understanding IOTA is like this Think of bitcoin and youll be in the ballpark. Now substitute out the block chain protocol for a new protocol called the Tangle which provides a bunch of brand new features like zero fees infinite scalability and very fast transactions. Theres a lot more to it than this but thatll give extreme beginners the the gist.   gt What advantages does it have over its competitors  or is it unique in solving a given problem?Block chains see all current cryptocurrencies on the market today are unable to scale up in volume require transaction fees to align incentives and secure the network and become completely vulnerable as soon as quantum computing becomes publicly available. IOTA solves these problems. IOTA is infinitely scalable meaning theres no limit to the number of transactions it can handle per second. This is vital in a world where machines and humans alike will potentially be transacting millions of times per second. Next IOTAs design aligns incentives such that miners and users are no longer decoupled. This means that transactions require zero fees. This is quite a unique feature.IOTA is also quantum proof meaning that the advent of quantum computing in  years wont degrade security. This is also very unique to IOTA. gt What disadvantages does it have and how do you think youll address them down the line?The project is still very new so many things are still in the works. Below are the two biggest hurdles in the way of future widespread use Fungibility  Lack of fungibility has been the topic of debate in bitcoin and other block chain communities. So much so that multiple new block chains were created for the sole purpose of private send transactions or untraceable capabilities. IOTA is still working on implementing its own version of private send which will be crucial for fulfilling the criteria of fungibility. Its New  IOTA is still mostly in development mode. Its aimed at developers in the IoT ecosystem meaning that its still largely inaccessible for beginners to understand. IOTA is currently focused on becoming the underlying transaction layer in the coming internetofthings revolution. Adoption in this arena will be crucial for even more wide spread adoption for things that could benefit from fast zerofee transactions. In the meantime all of the problems that go along with being a new technology apply to IOTA.gt What does the future of your project and the team working on it look like?The team is extremely experienced in this space and have proven full commitment since . The IOTA Foundation continues to see incredible additions to its ranks especially lately. The vision of becoming the backbone of the IoT has been crystal clear from day one. IOTA doesnt just transfer and store value. It can sendstore data as well. The use cases for a technology with these features are almost unlimited.  gt Why is this subreddit trending?Your guess is as good as mine.,Iota,dg17s9l,6,t5_2uyxv
