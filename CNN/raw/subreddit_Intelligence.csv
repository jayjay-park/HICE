Using statistical analysis and also other more subtle telltails they could get a goodenough recreation of what had been typed just by a analog tape recording. This of course isnt even taking into consideration the many other techniques they had if they had physical access to the machine in some way such as a discarded ink tape thing from the bin which would show how many of each letter was typed etc and could also be analysed back to what was written etc.,Intelligence,cfb6dp8,4,t5_2qugo

10224458,0,t1_dc27ad6,Maybe Im missing your point... but allow me to clarify something. By my network in the context of that post I was speaking of my personal network the one over which I have physical control  not rentedhostedhacked machines sitting in dispersed locations.gt And yet youve never seen any Russians all up in your shit? Really? Excluding the usual noise port scans and harmless probes etc. Ive only ever seen one attack that I suspect had Russian involvement. I had pwned up Irans ITRC and they later counterattacked hard. They even pwned one of my personal workstations.That said I have no reason to conclude that the Russian government was involved. It was likely just Russian hackers working for Iran.RuOther than that Ive rarely seen any serious attacks that I could credibly attribute to Russia.,Intelligence,dc2zzv8,1,t5_2qugo
10311125,0,t3_5nkh4p,Ahem!  gtJonathan Pollard  had provided intelligence to Israel relating to nearly every one of the key national security elements detailed in  USA Code  and most particularly had provided the Radio Signal Notations Manual which contained details of how the United States collects signals intelligence as well as the known parameters of the systems used by the Soviet Union. The information would enable an adversary to avoid collection by American codebreakers and if in the hands of a sophisticated adversary like the Soviets would permit penetration of U.S. systems. Former CIA Director William Casey and others believed that the Israelis provided at least some of the stolen information to the Soviet Union in exchange for the expedited emigration of Russian Jews.Israel already knows everything there is to know about leaking intelligence to Russia.,Intelligence,dcctlu7,7,t5_2qugo

Its not so great if your own safety is put at risk because a coworker or your employer overshared on social media.Another thing no ones talking about the potential danger to these independent researchers.
