2945213,0,t3_2trw04,Its absolutley insane this album was panned by critics when it came out Similar critics call it a classic today.  Funnily enough my specualtion was apart from their ditching their wacky style to an extent it was Dillas production that people didnt get at the time as the drum beats were sequenced slightly out of time in classic Dilla style and people thought this was a mistake.  Just my speculation though,90sHipHop,co2vucw,2,t5_2u3gx
