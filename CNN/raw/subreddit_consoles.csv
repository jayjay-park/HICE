I always find d side scrollers more difficult to control with a mouse obviously its possible to connect a controller to a PC but IMO that takes away from the core mechanics of PC gaming which is keyboard and mouse.And I say arcade racing because PC gaming wins simulated racing by a land slide with a vast varity of options like assesto corsa iracing and project cars. However games like forza horizon console exclusivity a side and the need for speed series cant be matched on PC  the hundreds of lisenced vehicles and the ease of jumping in and thrashing a vehicle around just seems so familiar and tailored towards a console.,consoles,crcercq,0,t5_2qxn6

First world problems I know but still a pain in the neck.Now Ive given my Bluray player to my sister my cable goes through the Xbox and I only boot up my Apple TV to occasionally watch my iTunes stuff and occasionally accidentally try to pause a movie there with my controller or voice commands. Plus it runs every game Ive played  or so installed now through used One and  discs sales Games With Gold and EA Access better than any PC I could hope to afford right now. Plus I can use my laptop to stream games! I even tried to ditch cable and get the OTA tuner but Id end up paying more just for worse Internet so Im stuck.Ill echo what other people have said. If you only want streaming media then a game console is not a good fit. I primarily chose my Xbox One because of the exclusives and the fact that the majority of my friends family and coworkers have one.
