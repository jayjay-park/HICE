5238570,0,t3_3mqd8p,By the way to the best of my knowledge this only works if you had your card in Google Wallets tap and pay system already. Those cards can be grandfathered in to Android Pay for the time being. This isnt specific to Simple and it wont apply to all Simple users.,SimpleBanking,cvhfrog,1,t5_2yhcp

10840157,0,t1_ddy26wd,I would be interested in what you find. also if there is a difference between mastercardvisa.I myself have disputed many things in the past. Almost everytime I have if I used a credit card I have been able to cancel the charge or charge back. However anytime I contacted one of my banks they always asked one question. Did you authorize the charge? If yes you are SoL if not fill out this paperwork and then expect a new card in the mail.I know in work situations like you maybe referencing employees get a pcardprocurement cardcompany credit card those are almost always credit cards as the company would not want normal employees having direct access to the company bank account with. a debt card,SimpleBanking,ddy333z,1,t5_2yhcp
