So in my opinion it can be very difficult to guess just by looking but the well trained eye can probably get within a few ,guessmybf,cypxhv3,2,t5_3bqmx

8409678,0,t1_d5s863t,Yeah I believe that would be sufficient to not lose the muscle mass try and switch the cardio you sre doing from time to time do some HIIT so it does not get boring. Overall you can also just skip cardio and train with weights and eat at a caloric deficit youll still lose fat so it is not mandatory to do it every training session it will just make the process fasterwhich is good because cutting for a long ass period of time is torture. If any other questions arise feel free to shoot me a pm will be glad to help,guessmybf,d5sr6b0,2,t5_3bqmx
