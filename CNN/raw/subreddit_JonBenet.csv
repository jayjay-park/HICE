6858183,0,t1_d0tnm21,Well yes. Possibly. I wonder if it was ever noted that the make up was identical to the night before? Of course if she was the main perpetrator I believe the vigorous energy needed to be put into the crime the likelihood of JBR fighting back sexual assault occurred while child was still alive would suggest the make up might require more than just retouching.

They gave very little time to the RDI theories.  But they never claimed that the film would be balanced between the two sides.  I thought it was well done.

9031651,0,t3_53y7xq,I can see it playing out as follows in each scenarioIDISomeone known to the family maybe a coworker of JR and has access to the house andor scoped it out during their house tour plans to break in and kidnap JBR and hold her ransom for the work bonus. Would have to be kind of a loner that didnt have their own family to spend time with on Christmas potentially destroying the picture perfect family is part of their motive? They break into the house while the Ramseys are out and write the note while theyre away having lots of time. They want to make it seem like its someone not known to the Ramseys. They carefully return  PRs pen and pad so they dont notice anything out of place then they lie and wait. They somehow manage to capture JBR in her bed at night without her screaming and waking anyone up no easy feat and I dont have a theory as to how. Take her to the basement and maybe feed her pineapple and talk to her they wear gloves so no prints from them. Maybe this family friend has assaulted her before and shes already under threat by them not to say anything. They assault her and knock her out planning their next move to take her out of there. They leave her in the basement and return the pineapple to the dining room table next to a glass so it looks like an innocent snack by someone and drop the ransom note on the stairs. They go into the basement to realize she isnt waking up still and think they might have damaged her beyond repair which would make her worthless. They hastily stage a murder scene that might frame the Ramseys and escape out the basement window and flee. Ramseys find the note in the morning and everything else follows their story of that morning.RDIIm a fan of the BDI Patsy cover up theory. They all went to bed and BR had snuck out of bed with the flashlight and served the snack to himself and JBR heard his spoon clinking and got up to investigate or maybe she heard him leave his room. She went downstairs and stole or shared pineapple with him eating with her fingers. They went downstairs with the flashlight to play with their new toys. Something set BR off probably related to their toys like her grabbing the one he wanted to play with first or something. He hit her with the flashlight he had in hand and it knocked her out. He didnt know what to do. He might have been the one touching her and that may have occurred before or after the hit on the head this time. He went and woke up mom told her somethings wrong with JBR. PR goes to the basement and realizes something is seriously wrong. She thinks JBR is dead and is worried something will happen to BR. Maybe she knows hes molested his sister or is worried the golf club accident set the scene for it being a murder and not an accident. She tells him to go upstairs and wait shell figure out the story with him after. So she stages the scene and strangles JBR roughly to make it look like thats how someone killed her. Maybe she even stages a sexual assault. JR realizes PR isnt in bed and remembers BR waking them up. He goes to investigate and realizes what PR and BR have done. Theres no going back now because theyll be charged with obstruction of Justice or even worse murder. So he lets PR write the note and they sort out the story with BR you never left your bed you never ate pineapple the last time you saw JBR was last night before bed. PR calls  about the kidnapping BR and JR are heard in the background. They send BR to bed and tell him not to come out until they come get him. They call friends pastor etc. When JR disappears he goes to see the body which he hasnt seen yet. He composes himself and goes to ask Fleet White to go check the basement with him again. He discovers the body. You pretty much know the rest of what happened.I would say I lean more to RDI between my two theories.,JonBenet,d7xgmiq,9,t5_35vmd

They definitely wouldnt stay on without an outer layer of clothing holding them up and even then they would probably be uncomfortable to wear. Would a child chose to open a new package of extremely over sized underwear and keep them on when her everyday underwear was easily accessible in the same drawer? I also find her answer intriguingPR  A. I cant say for sure. I mean I  think I bought them with the intention of  sending them in a package of Christmas things  to Atlanta. Obviously I didnt get that  together so I just put them in her her  panty drawer. So they were free game.Does this mean she didnt ship any of the Atlanta gifts before Christmas so she decided to keep all the gifts for herself? Quite the Grinch if that is the case. If she intended to deliver the belated gifts later then why keep underwear intended for a child twice JBs age and weight?I think it is more logical that all the Christmas gifts were placed in one place the basement and were  easily accessible for the cleaning and staging that took place. ,JonBenet,d8toe4w,2,t5_35vmd

9370248,0,t3_58u11u,I think he handed over the pad because he knew theyd find it anyway or maybe he thought they couldnt trace it because they had numerous pads like that and theyre commonly found. I think he also wanted to appear helpful so that they could maintain the victim as opposed to suspect narrative with police. Plus theyre claiming an intruder did it anyway so why not? This way it deflects suspicion and legitimizes the note refocusing police attention on an intruder which ultimately derailed the investigation. I think he had input on the ransom note and maybe even dictated it in part to Patsy. Its almost like they wanted the k figure out there to boast. Small ransom amount but large bonus for  look how important this guy is! Hed never commit a violent crime! Its also used to misdirect police to his coworkers giving Ranseys time to hightail to ATL and avoid police interviews instead making their innocence PR case with media. Who else would know the amount? John admits seeing the bonus on his pay stubs throughout the year so I think that was his idea. Although he said he didnt read the Day after Tomorrow book by Folsom it was found in his room and deals with international killings conspiracies executions and gives a garrote mention. That being said I tend not to think he had much to do with it other than assisting with the note appearing helpful to police and possibly staging with the faux garrote.  It sounded like he was never home so Im not sure how much time he spent with the kids and I therefore dont see him as ever abusing Jonbenet.

IF it didnt come out during the Grand Jury hearings already!,JonBenet,daolije,1,t5_35vmd

10055226,0,t1_dbi6oun, After more thought I feel that PR had to have at least been an accessory to the crime if not the main perpetrator for the following to reasons.  An innocent party would be less likely to call the police since they wouldnt have known that JBR was dead already and would have assumed the kidnapper had her .  The note threatens death if they call the police so the innocent party would not have called the police. But PR did call the police and did so straight away.,JonBenet,dbi7y2c,5,t5_35vmd

10118458,0,t3_5kswyl,Okay here it is. She doesnt deny it being in the house she just cant recall buying it.  This is long so I apologize.  TOM HANEY When was the last time you recall     that table being cleaned off?   PATSY RAMSEY After  well we would have   eaten pancakes together at that table on Christmas   morning. And then I would have cleaned the table up.   TOM HANEY Okay. In the course of having   the pancake breakfast would a glass or a bowl like   that inaudible.   PATSY RAMSEY No. I cant tell what that   is.   TOM HANEY We talked earlier this week about   lunch could you recall what would have been on the   menu for lunch?   PATSY RAMSEY No.   TOM HANEY Would it have been a bowl or a   glass?   PATSY RAMSEY No.   TOM HANEY Would you have eaten there for   lunch?   PATSY RAMSEY No because I think we ate a   late breakfast because of  Im not sure we had lunch   that day because we probably you know do Christmas   and then we had a big pancake breakfast and then we   were going you know  or  to the Whites for   dinner so we probably didnt even have lunch.   TOM HANEY Maybe is that maybe why you     didnt recall?   PATSY RAMSEY That is very likely why I   dont recall.   TOM HANEY Okay.   PATSY RAMSEY Somebody else did this   because I would never put a spoon that big in a bowl   like that and I cant tell what that is whether that   is grits or apples or cereal or  I cant tell what   that is.   TRIP DEMUTH Inside the bowl you are saying?   PATSY RAMSEY Inside the bowl.   TRIP DEMUTH Do you recognize the bowl?   PATSY RAMSEY Yeah.   TRIP DEMUTH Where do you keep them?   PATSY RAMSEY In the kitchen.   TRIP DEMUTH Where in the kitchen?   PATSY RAMSEY Well in like a cupboard over   to  there is kind of big sinks over here. There is   an island in the middle and big sinks and above that   the cupboard with dishwear in it.   TRIP DEMUTH What would you use these bowls   for?   PATSY RAMSEY Whatever. Cereal usually. I   usually  I think I got those little bowls for like   salsa you know salsa chips and salsa. I mean     because you had  there were other bowls for cereal   but that is inaudible.   TOM HANEY Those bowls you described them   being on the cabinet or a shelf and you demonstrated   it was higher. Is that something JonBenet could have   reached?   PATSY RAMSEY No.   TOM HANEY Okay. The contents of the bowl   does that appear to be pineapple to you?   PATSY RAMSEY Could be. Could be.   TOM HANEY That is what has been described   as    PATSY RAMSEY Is it? It could be.   TOM HANEY Do you eat or does anybody in the   family eat a bowl of pineapple?   PATSY RAMSEY Well the kids both ate   pineapple but I would never serve a bowl like that of   pineapple. I would think I would put two or three   pieces on their plate with the rest of their food or   something because I mean it looks weird to set out a   bowl like that.   TOM HANEY Just still talking about the bowl    itself and the pineapple and there is probably no way   to determine from the photograph whether this was fresh   or canned. Do you have either or both in stock at the     house there did you?   PATSY RAMSEY Usually I would buy those  I   bought pineapple it was fresh pineapple that had been     peeled or whatever they do to it and core it and cut   it up a little bit or some that had been fresh that   was sealed there in the produce area.   TOM HANEY What store did you buy this from?   PATSY RAMSEY Safeway is usually where I buy   it from.   TOM HANEY It is the fresh pineapple that   they do all the work for you?   PATSY RAMSEY Correct.   TOM HANEY Did you have bags or however it   came?   PATSY RAMSEY I dont know. It usually went   bad pretty quick so it didnt  you know I didnt   keep it around laying around very long. You know what   I mean?   TOM HANEY So people ate it fairly regularly   or consistently?   PATSY RAMSEY Well I didnt buy it terribly   often. But when I did I bought usually bought that   fresh and serve it out in little portions.   This looks weird to me a bowl with a huge   spoon like that with pineapple in it.     TOM HANEY Again JonBenet you said couldnt    reach the bowl. If she wanted pineapple would she get    it out herself.    PATSY RAMSEY Out of the refrigerator I    dont  no. That wouldnt be something she would    really go to.    TOM HANEY Did she like pineapple?    PATSY RAMSEY She liked it.    TOM HANEY Did she eat it as a snack?    PATSY RAMSEY Well we had so many other    things that she had for a snack first you know before    she got pineapple. But she wouldnt do this. She    would not have a bowl like this with a big huge spoon    like that.    TOM HANEY Would you do that?    PATSY RAMSEY No.    TOM HANEY Would     PATSY RAMSEY That is weird.    TOM HANEY Would John do that?    PATSY RAMSEY No.    TOM HANEY How about Burke?    PATSY RAMSEY No. He has a sweet tooth. He    doesnt like fruit too much. He likes pineapple a    little bit strawberries a little bit but he would not    pour himself a big bowl of pineapple.  ,JonBenet,dbqfy4s,7,t5_35vmd

10271612,0,t1_dc8c25j,I can understand Lin Wood seeing it as a big challenge. After hearing this podcast I really wonder if Burke has someone advising him about what his chances are vs. what the risks are. CBS has deep pockets  which perhaps could result in a large settlement  but it also means they have more money to invest in defense. ,JonBenet,dc8cdiu,4,t5_35vmd
10294974,0,t1_dc94pme,I find communicating with the police plausibleEspecially considering the police are going to be the ones finding out and investigating who had just murdered your daughterHi police officer I need to ring the jet company to cancel the plane we had booked for the vacation todayI was thinking that I would book one to take us to Atalanta to be with our families at this horrible timeWould that be ok?Im sorry mr Ramsey but we need you to stay close so we can interview you all and get statements then by all means you may fly to be with your familiesThat is plausible.Not disappearing and booking the plane before you were told you had to leave as it was a crime sceneRefusing to give a basic statement Then when the media and others get wind of the suspicious behaviour then try and spin it a few times with different reasons as to why and then stick with I did it to be with familyHe wanted to fly them away without the police noticing but they the police did notice and overheard the phone callNothing proves guiltBut it is extremely strange that your daughter has just been murdered and you suddenly stop involving the police and go off on your own to do sneaky thingsWhy not just talk to them? Ask the police? Say I obviously have no idea what happens now but can we leave to be with our families at this horrendous time?Anything other than evade police from that moment on.. So no I dont find it plausibleI was attacked and was almost killed I had no idea of what happened or would happen afterwardsI was driven in the passenger seat in one of the police vans to give statements straight away I sat and cried the entire way there panicked as I was worried about what would happen and if I could be charged with hitting the attacker with my car the only weapon I had I am female I was aloneit was an attempted car jacking and the man after not being able to open my doors climbed onto the bonnet of my car and started punching the windshield through I managed to unfreeze and reversed my car in a circle to shake him off while he smashed the whole windshield through with his fist and grabbed through at my neck and was choking meas I swung the car round he fell off I then put the car into drive and drove forward over him not intended as to hurt him but to get the hell out of there and drive offI did not go home and hire a criminal defence lawyer because if he was injured he could sue me or If he was Dead I could have been charged in a criminal case even though I was completely the  victim So no not plausible I was told the only thing I could have done was hit him harder by police because he managed to get up and run away and has never been caughtI knew the facts of what may have happened had I unintentionally killed him but I still listened to the police and went with them willingly to give a statement straight away and give evidence I was petrified but I still wanted to help the police catch himSo no grief panic stress uncertainty just makes you listen to the police even more  not automatically evade them,JonBenet,dcazp0g,1,t5_35vmd
10328337,1,t3_5nuaii,I think its confirmation bias to classify Burkes poo smearing as a sign of aggression when Jonbenet also had significant wettingpooping problems beyond the normal age.  The sensible thing would be to look for a common source of BOTH their toiletingpsychological issues instead of blaming Burke.  Maybe he was the aggressor but this poo stuff isnt the key to the case IMO.   I also wonder how much of the feces around the house was tested and determined to belong to Burke vs. Jonbenet vs. the dogother pet.  ,JonBenet,dcerwim,5,t5_35vmd
10335448,0,t1_dcfjr2l,Why not have John still in bed sleeping while Patsy wrote the note? Is it because you think she would have woken him up earlier to help search the house for her? I believe thats what Kolar was implying with his theory that Patsy took the responsibility of staging everything all by herself before John woke up and that when he found JonBenet at  a.m. it was genuinely the first time seeing her which is why he seemed shaken or discomposed as reported by Arndt when returning back upstairs shortly before noon or whenever it was. ,JonBenet,dcfkx97,1,t5_35vmd
10335675,0,t1_dcfl93t,That makes sense. But theres the question of why then didnt John seek counsel via phone before any other moves were made? While I do think that John would have written a more realistic much less ridiculous rambling ransom note if he had to write one Im more convinced by the notion that he would call his lawyer before anything and would have been informed about the age laws of CO or at least told to not try to stage a crime scene and hoodwink LE. ,JonBenet,dcflulp,1,t5_35vmd

10639709,0,t1_ddcq9vu,I cant see a  year old child falling over the railing unless she was thrown over it. That would be up to her shoulders. And falling down a wooden spiral staircase would likely put bruises all over her body and the turns would slow the fall A LOT. Although two years ago when one of my kids was  he fell down a carpeted regular not spiral staircase and had no bruises or injuries. It was horrifying to watch I was at the bottom and I swear he bounced down. I think youd have a lot more momentum on regular stairs than spiral because there was nothing impeding his fall but even there and even if he hit his head on a weight or something at the bottom I dont think it would have been remotely hard enough to do the JBR skull injury.,JonBenet,dddekkm,3,t5_35vmd

10936898,0,t1_de7z24c,To be honest I actually have looked at this book Its Me Edward Wayne Edwards the Serial Killer You Never Heard Of on Amazon and the reviews were somewhat compelling. The general gist of them seems to say that the book is poorly written and a lot of the material is pretty farfetched but that there are some connections made in the book that seem like they warrant further scrutiny. The title of the book makes my eye twitch as an English major and writer with the odd use of commas and the ending of the subtitle with a preposition. Excuse this if you are the author but this is book is a great example of why there needs to be a strong editorial sense in an author for them to make the most powerful arguments. This book seems to really dilute its case by trying to link Edwards with every prominent murder of the th century. As one of the reviewers put it Im surprised he didnt blame him for the Lizzie Borden murders.Care to make a case why I and others here should read this book? I read a lot of true crime stuff and buy books off of Amazon all of the time so I am in the demo but unconvinced based on the prevailing sentiment of the Amazon reviews. ,JonBenet,de82buk,1,t5_35vmd
11093909,0,t3_5xxw9f,You still have to take the known reality into consideration not just sweep them aside to indulge an IDI suspect.ampnbspHead blow happened first. There are no obvious signs of injury merely instant loss of consciousness. Appears dead or dying to layman.A mhr window of her laying there on the floor as her brain swelled and bled from a skull fracture none of them wouldve had any clue was present.Then the paint brush handle sexual assault that drew blood that ended up on the panties.Then the ligature fashioned applied and used  in spite of the appearance of death  until it gouged into her neck. The m to hr window did not take place after the ligature but before which is factually what ended her life. So what was IDI doing in that window before returning to finish the job theyd presumed was already finished as of the head blow?The prints of Burke and Patsy on the bowl and glass. The over  matchessimilarities between Patsys known writing and the note.The fecal smearing in JBs own bedroom and gifts. Did the housekeeper do that too?The fact Burke places himself downstairs in a window beyond midnight. ampnbspIts far fetched unless you have a viable realistic scenario that includes these facts. Just failing to give a sample having a key knowing the house  none of those things are evidence. The same exact rules apply for the Ramseys themselves...samples knew the house had keys had access to the notepad had the full advantage of time on their side had a nutjob son who smeared shit everywhere and his sisters stuff and the Ramseys rambled better than anyone...so how can you use these same rules for an intruder and and dismiss the family where there is physical evidence involved? ampnbspThe elements and evidence are what rule her out no matter how many keys ramblings or requests for money she had.,JonBenet,dephghy,3,t5_35vmd
11094029,0,t1_deoqqxw,If its any consolation the parents are innocent in her death. Their involvement would be covering for Burke  and as such its still a most loving act of compassion and loyalty to their child. Whether Burke was a little Dexter or Norman Bates in the making or whether he had an episode he still had serious issues that it appears theyd long since addressed in seclusion and with an island of privacy and he seems to have gotten on with his life as acknowledged with no other incidents to speak of. ampnbspThe Ramseys werent psychopaths they were parents of two children put in the worst possible position of having knowledge one of their children killed another one. They were just as much a victim as JonBenet in the long run this one act took their lives forever  by the simple fact it went viral and they were constantly on defense. The stress of that is insane. In other cases it dies down and people deal with it and move on. The Ramseys  much to their own doing however  were perpetually in the spotlight for  decades.ampnbspAll the same evidence pointed to the housekeeper applies at its root for the entire Ramsey family so you cant use it to rule them out and rule someone else in. They had home court advantage far greater than the housekeeper. ,JonBenet,dephy5a,2,t5_35vmd
11135528,0,t1_degqh3q,I agree. They knew CBS was about to put the light on Burke and his involvement...the Dr Phil thing was always damage control.ampnbspThink about it  if they knew it wasnt Burke for real theyd know that theres nothing CBS could put out there that hasnt already been out there in all this time. Kolars book came out in what ? Somewhere back then? BDI became more of a thing at that point and the Ramseys never bothered doing anything about it. They blew it off didnt suddenly come up with a bunch of public appearances. ampnbspBut when CBS jumped in and had the reach potential Kolars book didnt have even knowing Kolar would be involved it wouldnt take a rocket scientist to figure out the stuff was based on Foreign Faction...which is absolutely implying BDI and they covered for him. ampnbspBurke didnt do shit about Kolars book in  or whenever it was. The difference is CBS has the reach and money that Kolar didnt have and suddenly Burke decides this is all the best time to give an interview set up via Lin Wood and Dr Quack...and get it out there first because they had to know CBS would have something that would change the narrative entirely to BDI.ampnbspPure damage control. ampnbspIf it was never BDI CBS couldve put it out there and the Ramseys would just blow it off and ignore it because itd be bullshit speculation anyway. CBS and Kolar hit a real nerve...that theres truth to BDI and they know it. This is defense not offense.ampnbspAnd Johns statement was a definitive pure fiction about Burke being on the  call or down there at all...only to have Burke say he was awake he went downstairs and the enhancements proving that all three of them were downstairs near the phone during the call. ,JonBenet,deu795u,3,t5_35vmd
