145293,0,t1_ceuxxg9,The Katar class is called Brawler you can check them out here They spam skills to generate stacks of earthskyand so on touse with other skills to buffheal themself. Pretty much like duelist but with direct damage instand of dots and more selfsupport.,AuraKingdom,ceuzadu,1,t5_2z8l8
225179,0,t1_cf40l99,I second this. Now a days I actually just click on the location like Im going to autowalk and see where the mob is on the map. Instead of letting my Ostrich take me there I get off after knowing where Im headed and Glide the rest of the way. Gliding gives like  movespeed! Much better than the  from Ostrich.

246833,0,t1_cf4anzs,Gold is hard to come by in this game if you dont learn to use the auction house later on. Learn whats in demand recipes materials etc. Also considering how you have to craft everything yourself this game is more demanding on personal gold.,AuraKingdom,cf6c5gs,1,t5_2z8l8

386898,0,t3_1yibc6,Either fully CRT since you will get a lot of crtdmg and  elementbasedamage so its more effective or use a  SPD build  the metoer shot mastery for aoe damage. A mix would work too tho.,AuraKingdom,cfkv91v,1,t5_2z8l8

450236,0,t1_cfrfp40,Bards have solid damage and can get even more damage later on. They are also heavily dependent on speed to get their damage on. Another thing to note Heal over Times and Damage over Times have their tick rate affected by speed. With  cool downs or greater they tick every .s rather then once a second. And it only gets slow cuz youre running around talking to people. It doesnt become a slog until Id say... L or so.,AuraKingdom,cfrfuhq,2,t5_2z8l8
452515,0,t1_cfrnk0k,i see what u mean thanks for the reply man appreciate it lots. guess that as long as a bard and guardian exist most combination would work out. ,AuraKingdom,cfrp76b,1,t5_2z8l8

2049308,0,t1_cl030eq,Honestly Id say keep wizard. Im a lvl  gskatar used but Ive played gssorc gsgren and gswiz. Gsgren ranged skills and ultimates. The turret is kinda awesome and stacks with both your traps and gives you tons of dps. It gives you extra survivability because of the hp on the weapons and gives you a crit buff. No crowd controls or gap closer to sync with your traps.Over all rating Gssorc this is more pvp based because this lets you cap your eva fairly easy. It gives you tons of debuffs and sustain heal and life steal. If theres a higher level sorc though youre really over shadowed. Its a good solo subclass as the sleep totemdark flare trap stack aoe dots and it pretty nice in a pinch.Over all rating .Gskatar a great class combo except for the fact youre skills make you melee. Has a decent sustain and gives you some added hp to boot. Gap closers which sync perfectly with your traps but only stun that  target. Over all rating Gswiz the best sub class imo for gs. It gives you an aoe stun gap closer and aoe damage to help clear mobs and gives you decent crowd controls. Has a heal. Syncs perfectly with the play style of a gs and is one of the safer choices you can pick as a subclass. If you have a giant mob chasing after you you can safely kite all the mobs and kill them faster with your aoes compared to any other subclass. Over all rating ,AuraKingdom,cl0b8ph,2,t5_2z8l8
2096438,0,t3_2a4k6p,reading the comments I guess it is paywin in the end... all of them like no its not BUT u need top pay something etc... just admit it.,AuraKingdom,cl6axzp,2,t5_2z8l8

2881934,0,t1_cnvmeba,Did you try renaming all of them including the recruitment window? If you did and its still not working I have no clue whats wrong with your game either.Maybe try opening task manager and find game.bin or Launcher.exe. If they are running even tough you didnt open the game or its launcher close them and try again. If that doesnt work its probably better to ask in the official website forums.,AuraKingdom,cnvofsx,1,t5_2z8l8
3583642,0,t1_cq0q8ay,Even if players build their Tachi and Scythe correctly theyre easily outclassed by other classes anyways. Their contribution to a party or a raid is pretty lackluster.OP A future patch will buff Scythe class. There are many and easy ways to fix your DMG problems but you wont do that much compared to a Rav or a GS. You got to remember Scythe class is a lesser debuff version of Sorc.,AuraKingdom,cq0ric6,2,t5_2z8l8

6805855,0,t3_47597o,Personally Id go Tachi with a Wizard or Bard subclass. Scythe has really cool animations but thats about all it has going for it. Nearly everyone says it gets outclassed by Wizards and even Warbows. I cri evry tim.,AuraKingdom,d0nqlk5,1,t5_2z8l8
