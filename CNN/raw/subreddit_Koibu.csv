3156469,0,t3_2w71vk,How far in advance did you plan out this encounter? Do you come up with quests for the next session after you finished the first session or do you prepare  quests for the party beforehand so you dont have to worry about coming up with anything on the spot?Also how do you balance encounters? Do you take stuff like CRratings into consideration or are you more following your Gutfeeling? What do you think of the idea of confronting the party with a far too powerfull monster? I mean not putting them in a position they needd to fight one. But having them know of a basilisk that lives in a swamp nearby. Or a manticore who inhabits in some ruins on their way. Because I dont like the notion of Players start in a zone where there are only lowlevel monsters and as they get stronger stronger monsters just happen to come across! Isnt that convenient? I like the style of inhabiting the region with several creatures of different challenge ratings. The last question is a bit poorly worded... I hope you understand what i mean anyways  ,Koibu,cop5z0m,0,t5_2xbh8

8421067,0,t1_d5u4xw5,Maybe what would be nice is to make dualclassing more like multiclassing. You can decide to dualclass once you level and at that point you gain a level in your old class as well as your new one fighter  wizard  but do the hp rolls exactly like you would when multiclassing. From thereon out you split the experience between the classes maybe  maybe  idk what makes most sense and use mostly the multiclassing rules with the added restriction of the high ability scores needed for dual classing.,Koibu,d5u6cjm,1,t5_2xbh8
8432360,0,t3_4u5mo4,So Im on break and decided to think up some ideas for how to take down Karric. Firstly Id suggest getting some aid in the form of mercenaries or ask the countess for some footmen maybe a knight not too many to avoid tipping Karric off. Also Id recommend if killing one of the leaders The lady knight or Karric to make sure you kill the other as well because their death may be taken as a martyr by the other and to others and could worsen the situation. Also something I tried as a wizard in my own personal game is if you take a bad blow that brings you down to  hp or lower Id try and feign death just falling to the ground all dead like and getting back up or slipping away once theyve turned their back. But as for ideas in of themselves here are a few of mine feel free to use change or completely ignore these.. Assassination The Malakai exclusive mission where he memorizes as many invisibilities and sleeps as possible and sneaks in likely after they let a delivery in waits in Karrics chambers and kills him as he sleeps and do the same with the lady knight afterwards and slip off into the night. Meanwhile Van waits either in the town or outside the keep for backup.. Deception This plan requires a bit of luck and preparation to accomplish but its the most thorough plan I could think up. It doesnt require but would be handy if the training yard of the keep has grass where the soldiers are. And assuming youve got at least  max of  mercenariesfootmen you march to Anvil with them once near the city Malakai memorizes two invisibilities a fireball and Van a hold person but Id go with two if not three hold persons as well as both you grabbing other combat spells. Malakai turns both himself and Van invisible and gives specific instructions to the mercenariesfootmen to tell a lie to the gate keeper at the keep that theyd like to join up after being let in Upon entering Malakai cast his shield under the guise of his soldiers and his invisibility to avoid getting pelted with arrows or swords Van and Malakai wait for the lady knight to show up to greet the new recruits and then simultaneously cast their spells again under invisibility. Van casting hold person on the knight and Malakai casting fireball on the nicely bunched up soldiers training with each other. If more soldiers come out or some survive the fireball Van cast entangle on them to incapacitate them and assuming everything goes as planned you capture and disarm the knight and wipe out a large chunk of the soldiers and then take over the keep with the mercenariesfootmen and with overwhelming numbers capturekill Karric.If I come up with any others Ill post as I think.,Koibu,d5vl3ad,2,t5_2xbh8

8532905,0,t1_d685vlc,Scare doesnt prevent you from doing things the second all the enemy soldiers were down the scared troops were probably freaking out attempting to close the gate. They wouldve moved the bodies out of the way and probably seen they were still alive and killed them in their sleep. The penalty to attacking while being scared doesnt apply if the enemies are unconscious and you can auto kill them.,Koibu,d686f3v,1,t5_2xbh8

10935297,0,t1_de5lmes,Ryan has talked here about the possibility of researching spells with you and while it might be a bit of a tough battle to defeat whatever is in those shadow mountains.... I think with some custom spells with immense power it would be reasonably achievable. Whatever is there shadow dragon or not will most likely be the nastiest foe you have ever encountered and probably the strongest magic user you OR Georg have ever seen. I think the only way to really outgun whatever is there would be to have spells that only you two know. ,Koibu,de7wdhx,2,t5_2xbh8
