6985521,0,t1_d183gco,Thanks for the tip on Biomes in the airland.  I had sort of figured that out but I hadnt thought of your idea of putting two goo containers etc. to allow for multiple measurements on the same flight.  That will save time nicely!Did you watch the tutorials while learning to play the game?  Ive heard about them before but have been uncertain about whether to watch them or not.  On the one hand I know Id learn a lot from them but on the other hand I could see it being fun to learn the game in a more blind way.  I imagine there are some things that would be very difficult for me to figure out on my own so in that way I could see myself learning a lot from those videos.,fortheloveofgaming,d185dk1,1,t5_3ajfh

I mean at least in the realm of Vr. My x is great for everything else.I know theyre cheap but when i go to buy one Im like I could just put this away for a new card instead,fortheloveofgaming,d1sdzzg,2,t5_3ajfh
8670620,0,t3_4yophf,The exact same thing happened to me and now ME is my favourite franchise. ME is a little dated and clunky to get through though awesome story but ME is perfection in my book.,fortheloveofgaming,d6pg5c9,6,t5_3ajfh
8689650,0,t3_4ytepz,Far Cry Primal finally went on a deep enough discount Greenman gaming for me to pick it up.Im really pleasantly surprised by it! Its definitely a Far Cry game with all the good and the bad but theyve really made it feel different and the number of options for progression as well as the taming mechanic makes it feel really different and compelling enough that I planned on playing for  mins at first and ended up burning over four hours.I can understand if people have grown a little tired of the FC formula but I really believe they changed it up enough to make it worth a look. I didnt think the setting and time would grab me but they stay authentic enough with the language and subtitles as well as the idea of rebuilding a primitive tribecivilization that I think I might actually be hooked.I also got Rainbow Six Siege which Im loving as well. And Deus Ex comes out in about a day. Im starting to feel overwhelmed!,fortheloveofgaming,d6ru1e4,2,t5_3ajfh
