8543,0,t3_1u7rvg,Dont waste your time with halal certified wines. Obviously the people that are making these halal wines have never tasted actual alcoholic wines because they are VERY different. Most halal wines red wines at least taste like grape juice with added sugar. That being the case when cooking substitute wine for grape juice.Small volumes of Ribena can also substitute for red wine about  tablespoon for  cup of wine.For white wine Im not sure. Ive tried whitegreen grape juice. Doesnt work. Ive tried adding about  tablespoon of vinegar per cup of juice its close enough.

Once marital intention are clear both the girl and the guy generally discuss what they are looking for in a fulfilling marriage during these conversations we can get a feel of the other persons personality. Do they joke a lot do they seem too confident or unwilling to compromise on certain issues etc. NonMuslims if interested in a practicing Muslim girl should st look into Islam as a way of life if one sees that he can never be a Muslim. Then they should not pursue a Muslim woman. Because Islam does not allow Muslim women to marry outside of the Muslims. Now if she wanted to go against Islamic teachings.

48201,0,t3_1unnsh, We do not know our station with Allah swt so we should be in a state of humility.  If you have something that you want to be proud of yourself for know that the only reason you have that thing is because Allah swt allowed you to have it. It is not ultimately because of anything you did so give credit where its due. Allah swt is the reason we have the gifts we do.  Vanity and arrogance are really unadulterated stupidity and ignorance.  The cure is knowledge of how amazing Allah swt is and how small you are in comparison. When you see  ants walking on the sidewalk do you think one ant is better than the other? The differences between some of us are so small in comparison to how great Allah swt is.  Being arrogant leads one to not seek the counsel of others because they think they know everything belittling others and can even lead to disbelief.  The blessings we have are a test for us and we will surely be asked if we used our good qualities for good. ,islam,cejx1xb,6,t5_2qhbp

54247,0,t1_cekkool, Say To Allah belongs the right to allow intercession entirely. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will be returned. O you who have believed spend from that which We have provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is no exchange and no friendship and no intercession. And the disbelievers  they are the wrongdoers. Allah  there is no deity except Him the EverLiving the Sustainer of all existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High the Most Great.On Abrahams Intercession It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they were relatives after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire. And the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to Abraham that his father was an enemy to Allah  he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient.On Noahs intercession  On Muhammads Intercession for Abu Lahab Surah AlMasad . and Ask forgiveness for them O Muhammad or do not ask forgiveness for them. If you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times  never will Allah forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.and if those werent enough  And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all nor will intercession be accepted from it nor will compensation be taken from it nor will they be aided. And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all and no compensation will be accepted from it nor will any intercession benefit it nor will they be aided. And warn by the Quran those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord  for them besides Him will be no protector and no intercessor  that they might become righteous. And leave those who take their religion as amusement and diversion and whom the worldly life has deluded. But remind with the Quran lest a soul be given up to destruction for what it earned it will have other than Allah no protector and no intercessor. And if it should offer every compensation it would not be taken from it. Those are the ones who are given to destruction for what they have earned. For them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve. Do they await except its result? The Day its result comes those who had ignored it before will say The messengers of our Lord had come with the truth so are there now any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than we used to do? They will have lost themselves and lost from them is what they used to invent. So now we have no intercessors And there will not be for them among their alleged partners any intercessors and they will then be disbelievers in their partners. It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days then He established Himself above the Throne. You have not besides Him any protector or any intercessor so will you not be reminded? Should I take other than Him false deities while if the Most Merciful intends for me some adversity their intercession will not avail me at all nor can they save me? And warn them O Muhammad of the Approaching Day when hearts are at the throats filled with distress. For the wrongdoers there will be no devoted friend and no intercessor who is obeyed. So there will not benefit them the intercession of any intercessors. It will be said to them And you have certainly come to Us alone as We created you the first time and you have left whatever We bestowed upon you behind you. And We do not see with you your intercessors which you claimed that they were among you associates of Allah . It has all been severed between you and lost from you is what you used to claim.I guess there is a difference between intercession and direct worship. But as far as Im concerned from what the Quran tells me there is only one God to Worship that is Allah  and on the day of Qiyammah there will be no intercessor for me. That is all. Allah knows best. ,islam,cekltrk,1,t5_2qhbp

71499,0,t3_1uwjbs,Assalam AlekomFirst of all its ok to search for the truth. Every person must go through that.You need to be honest with yourself. Do you REALLY want to follow what Allah SWT has ordered you to do ? Though the Quran and the Hadith?If the answer is yes please read on.Everyone believes in God its a fact its part of fitra  the natural state of a human.The Prophet PBUH said Every person is born upon fitra but their family make him a Jew or a Christian or a Fire worshipper.Nobody has guidance this includes the prophets peace be upon them all until Allah SWT gives them guidance.The Prophet PBUH saidAllah SWT has said My slaves I have forbidden unfairness and injustice upon Myself and I have made it forbidden for you so dont be unjust.My slaves youre all misguided except the one I guide so ask me for guidance and Ill guide you. My slaves youre all hungry except the ones I feed so ask me for food and Ill feed you. My slaves youre all naked except the ones I clothe so ask me for clothing and Ill clothe you.My slaves you make mistakes night and day and I forgive all mistakes so ask me for forgiveness and Ill forgive you.My slaves you wont reach a level that youd harm me or reach a level that youd benefit me.My slaves if the first to the last humans and jinn would be on the heart of the most pious man amongst you it wouldnt add anything to my kingdom.My slaves if the first to the last humans and jinn would be on the heart of the most evil man amongst you it wouldnt remove or deduct anything from my kingdom.My slaves if the first to the last humans and jinn stood on one plane or field and asked me for things and I gave every person what they have asked for it wouldnt reduce anything from what I own except as much as a needle would reduce the sea if it got dipped in it.My slaves its your deeds I account it for you then recompense you for it.If you find good in that then praise me and if you find otherwise blame no one except yourself.Narrated by Muslim  Sahih Muslim  And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or what is faith but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants. And indeed O Muhammad you guide to a straight path You will not find guidance in the Quran unless you ask Allah for it. When we pray  times In every rakaa a day we ask Allah for guidance in the first SurahChapter of the Quran  times a day minimum we say Guide us to the straight pathThen in the nd Surah Baqarah the nd aya Verse Allah SWT saysThis is the Book about which there is no doubt a guidance for those conscious of AllahSo if you want guidance you have to ask Allah SWT for it. Many people have read the Quran and it didnt benefit them because they did not ask Allah SWT for guidance just look at the Orientalist.Now if you want to see how Allah guided the best of mankind in the Quran His Prophets read on.If you read the Quran youd find some very interesting things about Ibrahim the man who we follow today in our religion Milah  . And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham inclining toward truth? And Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend.If you look closely about the story of Ibrahim in the Quran youd find amazing stuff..He did not know who Allah was until He guided him! And thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain in faith So when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star. He said This is my lord. But when it set he said I like not those that disappear. And when he saw the moon rising he said This is my lord. But when it set he said Unless my Lord guides me I will surely be among the people gone astray. And when he saw the sun rising he said This is my lord this is greater. But when it set he said O my people indeed I am free from what you associate. Translation adds with Allah but thats not found in the Arabic text Indeed I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth inclining toward truth and I am not of those polytheists .The translation actually loses a chunk of the meaning but you can compare different translations on quran.com to get a better picture. Islam means to submit to submit to our Creator. He created us He knows us better than we know ourselves. Should He not know what He created? And He is the Subtile the Aware.The door back to Allah is open all you have to do is to turn back to Him and ask Him for guidance and forgiveness.If you want to submit to Allah but you cant get yourself to do it there is a simple solution. Ask Him for help!Ask Allah for help tell Him I want to be good but I cant get myself to do it  if thats whats stopping you be honest with Him and yourself. If youre scared tell Him. If you want support ask Him.He does not turn anyone away who wants to turn back.If you ask Him with a sincere heart He will guide you like He guided me!May Allah guide us all. Amen! ,islam,cemkhwe,1,t5_2qhbp

88323,0,t1_cen3yde,gtThese certain things are indeed prohibited because they are considered bidah. However when one researches a bit further he will see that the Sahaba did engage in Mawlid only except they never officially named it as such. Instead it was much like a Sirah gathering where people discussed and learned about the life of the Prophet peace be upon him and praised God. And historically people host these Mawlids weekly or monthly. It is only in these cases that Mawlid becomes a worthy act for the sake of God. But can we really call this Mawlid when it is usually restricted to once a year?Before we go further lets define what Mawlid is in its most basic form. Mawlid is the birth of the Prophetsaw in its most simple form. To celebrate mawlid is to celebrate the birth of the Prophetsaw. Now the Sahabahra from the ahadith didnt celebrate his birth but thanked Allahswt for the Prophetsaw. Dont take my word for it take a look at the image that is posed to my response in this thread. They thanked Allahswt for the Prophetsaw and not celebrated his birthday. There is a very big difference. If you sit randomly and thank Allahswt for sending the Prophetsaw it has no ties to his birthday hence that is not called Mawlid and that is permitted. But to use the birthday of the Prophetsaw and perform athkar based on that this is when it becomes an act never done by the Sahabah.gtIn essence taking Mawlid as a day of Eid for the Prophets birthday is considered not a good bidah. But taking Mawlid as a day or weekly or monthly or any other time range of reflection and thanking God for sending the Prophet peace be upon him is not wrong.Remember Mawlid is celebrating the birthday of the Prophetsaw and celebration of birthdays or using the birthday as a point for celebration has no basis in Islam and has its basis in Paganism. ,islam,ceohg97,1,t5_2qhbp

When He created him He said to him Go and greet that group of angels and listen to their reply for it will be your greeting salutation and the greeting salutations of your offspring. So Adam said to the angels AsSalamu Alaikum i.e. Peace be upon you. The angels said Assalamu Alaika wa Rahmatullahi i.e. Peace and Allahs Mercy be upon you. Thus the angels added to Adams salutation the expression Wa Rahmatullahi Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam in appearance and figure. People have been decreasing in stature since Adams creation. Translation of Sahih Bukhari Volume  Book  Number Narrated Abu Huraira Allahs Apostle said The first group of people who will enter Paradise will be glittering like the full moon and those who will follow them will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. They will not urinate relieve nature spit or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold and their sweat will smell like musk. The aloeswood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their father Adam in statute sixty cubits tall. Translation of Sahih Bukhari Volume  Book  Number Abu Huraira reported Allahs Messenger may peace be upon him as saying The first group of my Ummah to get into Paradise would be like a full moon in the night. Then those who would be next to them they would be like the most significantly glittering stars in regard to brightness then after them others in ranks. They would neither void excrement nor pass water nor suffer from catarrh nor would they spit. And their combs would be made of gold and the fuel of their braziers would be aloes and their sweat would be musk and their form would be the form of one single person according to the length of their father sixty cubits tall. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ibn Abi Shaiba with a slight variation of wording. Translation of Sahih Muslim Book  Number Abu Huraira reported Allahs Messenger may peace be upon him as saying Allah the Exalted and Glorious created Adam in His own image with His length of sixty cubits and as He created him He told him to greet that group and that was a party of angels sitting there and listen to the response that they give him for it would form his greeting and that of his offspring. He then went away and said Peace be upon you! They the angels said May there be peace upon you and the Mercy of Allah and they made an addition of Mercy of Allah. So he who would get into Paradise would get in the form of Adam his length being sixty cubits then the people who followed him continued to diminish in size up to this day.

Most famous example is his location of death or his age of death or the  prophecies of a son to come which never happened or his prophecy of marriage to a certain woman etc. For each of these situations unsurprisingly the Ahmadiyya have an excuse. It is either a metaphor or the prophecy was merely conditional. I dont blame them in that they wouldnt be Ahmadiyya if they didnt backup or find ways to defend every claim of their leader for if they believed that he was wrong on any of the statements they would not believe in him as a prophet who receives these prophecies as revelations from God.,islam,cesjdle,5,t5_2qhbp

That there is still a specific moment where humanity as we know comes into play and it is now considered the human beings we accept today.Granted if we can accept that the creation is something that appeared out of nothingness and went on to produce an infinity of celestial bodies and within them eventually an infinity of elements and justcomplexenough molecular structures and eventually an seaming infinity of life eventually leading up to us who are capable of creating an infinity of inventions if we can accept that as allahs creation  then why not the current state of knowledge on bio diversity?Well one thing most older muslims are just not educated.

195784,0,t1_cf08bys,Well I am no expert on either matter science or religion but Ill try to articulate. Man has existed for a long time. Different peoples and nations are mentioned in stories in the Quran some peculiar due to culture others due to physical differences. Whether that means humans had different physical forms linked to evolution or not that is up to interpretation. The general belief is the humans have existed with Adam being the first of them to walk the earth. Since the Quran was revealed in a way so that the human can understand it would be difficult to connect the way creation came about to the metaphoric references in the Quran. I view it as a mistake most faiths have made to take some of the text literally when it explains stories of the past.Anyway in conclusion Adam was created as a human. For the purpose of being a human. Not from another creation. He is the first created by Allah and given Hawaa Eve as a partner.There are numerous verses in the Quran that several centuries in the Quran were completely unexplainable until our current day an age. I dont have the exact verses but upon request I can provide. Verses that described the human embryology the alaq  as a blood clot or leechlike with a chewed appearance. Before we had the tech to confirm of this it was metaphorically explained. Similarly with the formation of mountains insemenation planetary revolution etc.The point I am trying to make is Evolution could very well have existed alongside Humans and a scientific theory is merely a tested prediction that does not necessary qualify as a law. It can still be falsifiable. Im not going to go further about evolution because some people feel the need to rage about it unnecessarily. In the end I am no expert. Anything I said that is incorrect is my own Human shortcoming. Anything that is true is from the blessings of Allah for he in the end is AllKnowing.Peace,islam,cf0qox5,1,t5_2qhbp

505988,0,t3_1zx8tq,From the fatwaOne should always keep in mind the objective and spirit of Shariah concerning the various legal punishments. The idea is not to enforce the punishment and make people suffer rather the objective is to prevent harm corruption and immorality in the society. Thus legal punishments act as deterrents more than actually get people punished.Allah Most High saysIn the law of retaliation there is saving of life to you O you men of understanding. Surah alBaqarah...This trying to avert a legal punishment has been explicitly mentioned in one Hadith. Sayyida Aisha Allah be pleased with her narrates that the Messenger of Allah Allah bless him amp give him peace said Keep the Muslims away from punishments as much as possible. If there is any way out for an offender to escape punishment acquit him. It is better for a judge to make an error in acquittal than in conviction. Sunan Tirmidhi no ...If the witnesses refuse to take part in stoning the perpetrator the punishment will be dropped as this would be considered a sign of them taking back their testimony....The reason being is that one is not obliged to confess that heshe committed adultery hence one may keep the sin hidden and not inform the Islamic judge about it. Also the various Islamic legal punishments hudud are only carried out in an Islamic state dar alIslam by the Imam thus repenting to Allah Almighty will be sufficient.Also mentioned are all the necessary things to even try convicting someone of having committed adultery.Of course this is not to say that punishment isnt taken out on those actually admitting everything themselves because it will. But the punishment is rarely taken out and many people on reddit seem to have this idea that people in shariah are dropping left and right because they had sex like wild animals on the street. Thats not the case. And in the time when getting food was hard didnt Umar ibn al Khattab take away the punishment for stealing because people at that time would be desperate? Shariah tries its utmost to preserve life and help it develop not hinder it. And when the problem had left the punishment was implemented again as a deterrent amp as a practice. Shariah is not some fixed thing that is unchangeable that will try to erase you from society. It never has been alhamdulillah.,islam,cfxs81z,7,t5_2qhbp

Although the Christians did fight Muslims for reasons of religion under the blessing of the church crusades.Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes  from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed Allah loves those who act justly. Allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion  forbids that you make allies of them.

Adampbuh and Evera. You dont need any fossils at this point.  Just need sufficient understanding of the science behind cellular reproduction studying of what we found in our dna including a lot of is currently junk dnadeactivated and math.You cannot understand most sciences fully without math.  Most people do not calculate how evolution occurs as they do not understand the fundamentals of large numbers.  But when you understand the basic principles it is easier to digest.  Hundreds of millions of years of evolution is just that.It has been many years since college and this is not my profession but my goal is to go over the basics anyway.All cellular reproduction whether we are talking about mitosis identical cellular reproduction as found in bacteria or meiosis results in flaws in replication or in case of meiosis combination of the two different haves of dna from two different sources like people and other animals.   These flaws are inevitable and occur all the time.  Now if you take one instance of this reproduction then mathematically not much change in dna maybe some small random difference.  Now take ten iterations and still not much difference.   iterations amongst hundreds of thousands to millions of the same species then you will probably see some new traits.  Now multiply that by another  and you will see how that is a vessel for real change.Mathematically its impossible for anything other possibility.Combine that with the study of our dna and the story it tells.  Much of it is nonfunctional but shared with many other nonhuman species that currently exist.  We also have evolutionary left overs in the form of vestigial organs that had use for our ancestor hominids and earlier species but are completely useless to us homo sapiens sapiens.The hominid fossils we find are just the icing of the cake that teaches us the history of our species and gives us examples to look at.  As we advance in technology we can look at cellular reproduction and study dna with unprecedented accuracy that such a thing is not necessary in proving evolution but does aid us in understanding the history of it.,islam,cg78r4o,1,t5_2qhbp

Its mentioned in the Quran that you should establish prayer but no actual method is given for it.This is just a small example.And whatever the Messenger has given you  take and what he has forbidden you  refrain from. And fear Allah  indeed Allah is severe in penalty.The Quran was revealed but it was up to Muhammad PBUH to explain various verses and answer questions. The hadith are complimentary to the Quran and although the authenticity of many is unclear and some are entirely madeup we should only follow Hadith in as much as it agrees with the Quran. I would stray away from using Hadith that are not in Bukhari and Muslim but since so much time has passed I am sure many of the Hadith we accept as Sahih are actually fabrications. All this being said the wisdom of the Prophet PBUH is of such great value that it is worth reading and living by the hadith knowing that some of them are not authentic. The value outweighs the harm. This is because we have the Quran as the final arbiter that we can refer to in times of doubt. ,islam,cgcz8q1,1,t5_2qhbp

820307,0,t1_cgxb97z,gtcompletely different religionI think thats a gross exaggeration.  Christianity and Islam are completely different religions.  Sunnism and Shiism are two branches within the same religion.  To say otherwise is to completely blow out of proportion the few small differences between them.gtAqeedah TahawiyyahThere is very little in there that a Shia would disagree with only a couple of the points at most.  The main one that would cause disagreement isgt. We do not accept rebellion against our Imam or those in charge of our affairs even if they are unjust nor dowe wish evil on them nor do we withdraw from following them. We hold that obedience to them is part ofobedience to Allah the Glorified and therefore obligatory as long as they do not order to commit sins. We prayfor their right guidance and ask for pardon for their wrongs.If not believing in being obligated to follow injustice is such a huge heresy that Shias are following a completely different religion then yes I will concede that that is the case.There are even some things that I think some more literalistic Sunnis might disagree withgt. Anyone who describes Allah as being in any way the same as a human being has become an unbeliever. Allthose who grasp this will take heed and refrain from saying things such as the unbelievers say and they willknow that He in His attributes is not like human beingsWhat about people who say that Allah literally has a hand or a face or a foot like a human has a hand or a face or a foot?,islam,cgxiru0,3,t5_2qhbp

It is only when this light shines upon and illuminates the hearts of people do they find faith. Faith isnt an achievement but rather a mercy from God upon his servant! I usually say to be able to believe first youve gotta be willing to believe. It takes a leap of faith a leap into the unknown to see if theres anyone there who can catch your fall. Often its a moment in the persons life where one feels compelled to take this leap. Its this journey into the unknown you need to take to be able to seek the truth!

And I dont see where in my argument did I imply women cant take care of families of course they can and they do sometimes. And I think its unfair to label the inheritance law of sharia as gender discrimination. Because there are cases where a female and a male get the same portion of the money of the deceased females getting more than the male and females getting a portion while a male doesnt. You need to go through the whole law thoroughly and when you do youd see how ridiculous your claim is.B Please provide a source for your hadith.C She wasnt married at the stage where she was still playing with dolls. When she did get married she had matured and grown out of this phase. Youre doing exactly what the crazies in Saudi and Pakistan are doing which is put that which had happened in the th century in the Arabian desert in the context of today. If you give a quick read of the definition of maturity youd understand that it is absolutely relative. It varies depending on various different context. Regarding if she was physically and biologically ready to get married you might also want to check out Montesquieus the spirit of laws where he said that in hot climates women were marriageable starting from the age of  or so. And he was a very harsh critic of Islam by the way. So bottom line Aisha RAA was mature and of marriageable age. D Women do have rights in the case of the Noshoz of the husband.

984024,0,t1_chg4dd7,Hey Im sorry if I didnt clarify my point well enough but I completely agree with you. gt If anything Id argue that though Islam does play a role its not mutually exclusive but rather only a part of a very complex situation that takes into consideration both history and modern social issues into effect.This is exactly how I feel on the matter. In the face of globalization and decolonization of many Muslim countries many postcolonial political trends like ethnic nationalism socialism and neoliberalism failed to bring prosperity to Muslim countries. In this environment I think radical Islamist movements developed their followings and became a powerful force in many Muslim countries. Regressive radical Islamist elements are using economic and political turmoil to forward their ideology. We saw it in Afghanistan we saw it in Kashmir in Mali and were seeing it in Syria. With this in mind I think its important for Muslims all over the world to denounce violent ideologies wherever they see them. Political and economic circumstances paved the way for the rise of radical Islamist groups but I think that we can do more to let the world know their actions fall outside the scope of Islam. ,islam,chg53o9,2,t5_2qhbp

Average education of the village is upto th grade. They have accepted the divorce but I havent because I dont believe our deen to bring hardship. Pakistani men generally use the divorce to scare the women into doing what they want and being submissive to them whether they follow the deen or not. I understand what you are saying. But I have read and heard that the  times saying it together or saying it only one time is the same. Any divorce comes with iddahwaiting period the  divorces are  actual divorces not saying it  times. So you can remarry the same person upto  times. Pakistan is in a bubble and though there might be great scholars in Pakistan. I am unfamiliar with them. Which is why I was asking rIslam for direction and sources to whom I can reach out to.

1242955,0,t1_ci9fuyg,gtIts not really the largest religion. Lot more practicing Muslims then Christians and even if it is well that was only in the past  years when Europeans started imperialism and forced conversions. However Islam is currently the fastest growing religion. Whereas Christianity is in noted decline such as in England particularly among youth Islam is growing. Explain why God would allow that? Explain why God needed His true religion to be forced in brutal inhumane ways that would violate His central message? Explain why God wouldnt make Christianity the fastest growing religion. There are a massive amount of Muslims that are considered to be practicing due to the fact that they live under sharia law.  I have friends with an agent to tell me about the massive underground communities of gays and atheists you have to hide their identity in order to not face persecution.Numbers are constantly skewed but the population is pretty wellestablished.  There are more Christians on earth currently than Muslims though that doesnt really matter.  That Islamic population though is keeping it numbers up through reproduction asking be seen within Europe quite easily.  The average and Islamic family has about  children a local families have about  to .Christianity is been keeping his numbers Im due to mass conversion within East Asia and Africa.  Therere about  million Christians at the beginning of the th century in Africa.  Now there is over a half  billion.gtNo one did that. The authors of the gospels were not the actual men. This is a proven fact that all Biblical Scholars not Muslim Scholars accept.It was humans that were writing the Bible through their observations and God.  The Bible is actually a collection of different letters written to different people.gtwhile waiting  to go to a man who God would be the first to tell that Jesus was not the Messiah  Christians were the first actually as Ive shown.Christians are not told that Jesus was not the Messiah Christians only existed the moment Jesus died.  But God obviously made a lot of events possible for these people who actually lived with Jesus to believe that Jesus was something more than a prophet.gtBecause God wanted to show His love and power. God sent Jonah to pagans. God wanted to take the worst people on earth and make them the best people which is actually what He did.God also didnt have a wellestablished religion at the time with a man he just sent you established another religion that was supposedly false.Not every situation is exactly the same as one that is explained in the Bible.  But there is logic behind my God does.  gtIslam confirms all the teachings of the past prophets Islam is the sheepdog the dog that organizes the sheep into where God wanted them.Buddhism also confirms the teachings of Hinduism but takes it is step further and establishes new rules and a new focus.Coincidently Jesus was known as the shepherd.  The image of the lamb is constantly used to represent Christians as Jesus guides them.  Or least it was more common in the earliest th century.I also want to make it clear Im not trying to attack anybody Im just trying to understand the absolute truth.  There are so many contradictions in this world and theres a lot of evidence that supports a lot of different ideas.  But theres only one truth one God and one story.Understanding the logic behind why goblet would do what he do is much more simple and I will look at it through the eyes of Christianity.  Whenever I try to think about Islam being true I cant help but believe that God intended Jesus to be misinterpreted through how he impacted the people around Jesus.Take care and God bless.,islam,ci9g568,1,t5_2qhbp

1302425,0,t3_28y7ya,I dont have anything for your specific situation but I will offer you my own story of the past year. You can be sure that my life has had similar and worse ups and downs in the past and Im only  almost .I was living with my aunt blood relative and uncle not blood and my uncles children who were from his previous wife. My aunt does not have any kids of her own but she did adopt me and my brother after my mom left and dad died many many years before. She got married to my uncle a few years later and we had been living in this household since. Just read this a couple of times to understand the premise correctly.Now some of my uncles children are fond of fitna and some are either outright disbelievers and others are hypocrites. I dont like using these terms but I solely base this on my observation of their actions and words. Anyway. I was preparing for the most difficult exam of my life CFA level  and there was  month left for this exam. One day the fitna loving children made a big fuss and kicked my brother aunt and myself out of the house and we basically barely escaped with our lives and we practically had nowhere to go. So I called a friend of mine and we started living in his parents spare house till we could figure something out. Our financial situation was extremely weak at this point and my aunt only had some property that she had been trying to sell for the past  years but couldnt.God knows how we managed but alhamdulillah we first moved out to a small abode which wasnt even enough for my  dogs as there was no lawn. It was difficult providing for their food let alone anything else. My exam preparation was in jeopardy with the stress and increase in my workload.Long story short after all was said and done we managed to sell off the old property and got a place for ourselves and I passed the exam. Allah created opportunities for us out of literally nothing and we found sustenance in the unlikliest of places. Only my brother was working before and now me and my aunt started to work on our own projects where the immediate need for money has disappeared and we are living more than comfortably and its a place with a good lawn where the dogs can retire in peace.After thinking a lot about this situation I concluded this could never have happened had we remained in my uncles household due to the amount of restrictions on us and especially our aunt. Do I agree with Gods method of all of this? Maybe I feel it could have been less stressful and maniacal. Having said that though this life IS meant to be a test. Allah is going to test our iman and he will especially test it when  it is strongest after reversion in your case or in my case when I actually started to follow Him. So as much as I complained during this ordeal I can only thank Him for His divine wisdom and love that He has for me and my family.I hope you can take something positive from my story. This is just one of the MANY stories I have and its not even the worst P. Each time I relearn the lesson that Allah does everything for a reason and He is indeed the best of planners. The difficulties of this life are meant to test  us to our limits and we must rise up to these tests by asking for His mercy. Insha Allah He will raise us in ranks for the patience and obedience we exhibit in this life. The rewards will be granted in this life as well as the next.,islam,cig50xb,1,t5_2qhbp

Theres significant evidence that genetics determine about  of cases so its very realistic to assume that all the children have it if one does.So yeah their parents should have taught them better and made sure they were behaving or perhaps asked for help but theyre also parents of children who possibly have behavioural disorders and they just want to be part of the community.

I however dont believe scholars have a power that was and is only reserved for Allah.gtBut those things happen to be major cornerstones of what the already clearly defined definition of a Muslim is. We believe in the KhattamanNabiyyat of the Holy Prophet SAW. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wasnt a new prophet but upheld the Sharia of the Holy Prophet SAW. Our belief doesnt go against the KhattamanNabiyyat.  Calling people nonMuslims just because they hold different views seems rather primative doesnt it?gtBelieving in a prophet after the last prophet is not following the  pillars and  articles of iman to a tee.See comment abovegtNo people who are not Muslim started declaring themselves Muslim. Then people who are Muslim called them out on this. If I call myself Muslim state the Shahadah and follow the  pillars and  articles then please explain to me on what grounds I am not a Muslim and how it is not a logical fallacy for you to say that I am not a Muslim. ,islam,citr0ba,1,t5_2qhbp

1433469,0,t3_2ak61f,Are these Islamic Studies programs from secular institutions? If so it really does not surprise me at all why your situation is as it is. Those programs are largely remnants of a bygone and perhaps still active Orientalistcolonialist era a way for nonMuslims to understand Islam without having to accept it.That is as far as I can see most of the theories developed by such orientalists are developed with a secular mindset a mindset that Islam is wrong from the outset. For example most orientalist scholars will say that most if not all hadith are fabricated. This is based on an assumption of conspiracy which really is not a valid argument if we look at it objectively. The reason orientalists do reject it is because there are so many Sahih and Mutawattir hadith pertaining to miracles. So rather than explaining the miracles of the Prophet which they assume are false they decide to deny the entire hadith tradition.This is largely the same with even the Biblical tradition a lot of what is termed Biblical studies in the West is simply looking at Jesus through a secular mindset and essentially assuming the worst which is what they do in Islamic studies as well.As for why I believe in Islam I believe in Islam due to how much its theology is truemakes sense.There are no Godmen in Islam there is no triune God God is as  says there is NOTHING like unto Him.I believe in the Prophet because I believe the accounts related by other people pertaining to his honesty his miracles his humbleness and so on. I believe in the Prophet because as the Quran declares he has been mentioned and predicted in previous scriptures.I believe in the Prophet and although this is subjective for me because I believe the Quran is a magnificent book unlike anything that Ive ever read and I cannot even say that I have even scratched the surface of this Book. I believe in Islam since if I look at other religions Islam makes the most sense to me.

Either way I have given you a very good legal source documenting instances of discrimination.

1487447,0,t3_2b6cxk,There is a internal struggle with in the human being. struggle between the nafsmaterial body and the struggle of the Fitrahsoul natural disposition. The body is created from clayearth so it find its provisions and wants from this world the soul is part of Allahswt light that was blown into the clay body. So the food for soul is being with God reciting his word. Muslims are taught that souls of all human being were created and asked by Allahswt. Am I not your master we all proclaimed that  you Allahswt are I fact out master and creator. When we come into this world the soul is blown into the womb around  months. Since the soul isnt the drive of this body the body cant remember the promise the soul has made to Allahswt. This is why in Arabic humans are called Insaanthe one who forgot. Quran is as also called the balaghremembrance. With this background in mind you will see that when ever the call to come to the worship of Allahswt has this affect on many of us. The soul starts to feel restless and wants to be closer to its source of Origin. This is good news for you because it also says that your heart hasnt been too corrupted. Wht I mean by that is the heart is the passage way to the soul. The more corruption we spread the blacker out hearts get eventually closing the door to the soul. An example to understand this would be the brain is the access point for or bodies. If the brain doesnt function we are but a shell of a human being. So the brain is to our bodies what the heart is to our soul. My suggestion would be that explore this religion ask as many questions as you can. In the end if nothing comes of it you atleast gave it a shot. But this really is an opportunity for your to start focussing on your soul and its needs. ,islam,cj2q5xq,0,t5_2qhbp

1633300,0,t1_cjkwyff,Also on the kafir allegation as I have stated elsewhere In all of our literature the nonAhmadi Muslims are referred to as nonAhmadi Muslims. Not kuffar. Further when Pakistan was being created in the s our second Khalifa Hazrat Mirza Bashiruddin Mahmud Ahmad said anyone who calls themselves a Muslim should be recognised as such and this remains our principle to this day.Morevoer he made the Ahmadis migrate from Qadian in India to Pakistan. If he had considered all nonAhmadi Muslims to be Kuffar what difference did it make whether he lived with the kuffar of India or the kuffar of Pakistan? Clearly he delivered a public fatwa on the occasion that all the nonAhmadi Muslims must be recognised as Muslims or he would not have migrated.I realise there are isolated quotes from Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad which can be interpretedtranslated opposed to this. However as these quotes are in the minority and the vast majority of cases they have been described and treated as Muslims then the only conclusion is that within context we recognise nonAhmadi Muslims as having the right to be called and treated as Muslims.We do however believe Ahmadiyya to be the only form of true Islam today and that anyone who rejects Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad has disbelieved in a man appointed by God. I hope you dont find this offensive I have not written it with the intention to offend  all sects believe their believes to be the most truthful and therefore all other sects to be at least somewhat misguided and we are not unique in that.,islam,cjl1jhj,-15,t5_2qhbp

1702148,1,t3_2dwacv,Hi Blueberry crepe!Within the Sunni system there are  major Madhabs or school sof thought. Think of these as four different referees they each call the game different but they are consistent about the way they do it. Sunnis believe that they are all viable and legitimate. Hanafi Founded by AbuHanifaHe lived in Kufa Iraq and when discussing jurisprudential matters personal judgements are allowed in the discussion. This madhab is prominent in areas like Iraq Turkey Egypt and IndiaMaliki Founded by Malik bin Anas He lived in Medina where descendents of people lived and breathed with the Prophet peace be upon him. He used what is called Living tradition to make many of his rulings as opposed to Sahih tradition. Living tradition involves actually asking the people of the Medina how did the Prophet pray? Eat? Etc since their grandfathers and great grandfathers lived with the Prophet. This is one of the reasons Maliki adherents pray with their hands by their sides. The Maliki school is prevalent in many parts of Northern and Western AfricaHanbali Founded by Ahmad Bin HanbalHe stressed the importance of looking at hadith unlike Imam Malik. Many followers of the Hanbali school can be found in places like Saudi Arabia and Syria. Shafii He was raised in Mecca and taught in places like Egypt and Baghdad. He also emphasizes the importance of Hadith but also stresses the importance of community consensus when making jurisprudential rulings. He is credited with elevating the status of Hadith in Sunni circles as something to be sincerely followed and revered. You will find many Shafii in Southeast Asia such as Malaysia. The four above madhabs are followed by Sunnis and not Shia. The main Shia sect is the Twelver school of Shia Islam. Basically we believe there is a succession of twelve leaders after the death of our Prophet pbuh  whose rulings we follow and have developed our own hadith science and jurisprudential system and our Sixth Imam Jafar asSadiq as is credited with advancing Shii jurisprudence and even had students like the founder of the Maliki school  Imam Malik.EDIT Thanks ubaronfebdasch gt Hopefully that is what you meant.I do not have the time to delve into the differences between Sunni and Shia thoughttheology.

If I have to justify why it is forbidden we must first establish that it is forbidden which is not a done deal at all.If you search this sub youll find so many threads asking about music and so many arguments on why it is permissible or why it isnt permissible. We get like at least two posts about it every week.See this post for more detailsor any of the others if you wish. The point is it isnt a done deal every muslim takes the opinion of the scholar he trusts or the majority opinion or even weigh the arguments and choose for himself risky since ones judgment might be clouded by his own desires.

After I developed a basic understanding of the fundamentals it got easier.WARNING This might geek you out but just incase youre interested in how passionate students learn.....Muslim scholars have developed over the centuries multiple ways. One of the most popular is the  gradual method. This does not start off with a comparative approach or an approach that even addresses the depths of religious proofs. Its more of a bookbybook analysis   The Matn The scholars summarized all of the rulings of a particular school in a short book that focuses on recording the authentic opinions. It includes all of the essential conclusions that the lay man yearns for application.   The Sharh Then the scholars would provide the student with an explanation of that summarized text. This explanation would embelish on some of the reasons of that stronger opinion indicating some weaker opinions in the school. The explanation may be brief or lengthy and the focus of each one differs and depending on the students intellectual growth heshe will be given what is suitable in that stage.    The lengthy Sharh or Hashiya This more advanced level will cover the evidences of both the strong and the weaker opinion in that school. The unique addition that the student is exposed to is how scholars working off the same foundations the principle foundations of their school reached to different conclusions.    After these levels of instruction the student will be more capable of fully benefitting from the comparisons of diverging opinions being that he is fully grounded in one method.Hope this helped mate.,islam,ckcf7lr,1,t5_2qhbp

Gay people and all other sexual minorities that you probably look down upon have been doing it for ages. However it is difficult. I would suggest getting help from someone who has been in one.God willed you to be gay. He couldve willed you to be Zoophilic or straight.

1957944,0,t1_ckp4f60,The only advice I can give to you is that you increase your knowledge about Islam. The more you increase your knowledge everything will become more clear. I strongly recommend you watch Hamza Yusufs lecture.gtSee you are being a takfiri again you need to stop doing that brother it is not good for you or the ummah. I am sure your intentions are good but what if you are wrong and some of the hadiths are fabricated? Isnt one of the miracles of the Quran that it cant be fabricated? I dont recall God giving any other text such miracles. Peace.Again you dont understand what a mutawatir hadith is. Or how the quran was compiled or transmitted. Read what a mutawatir is.  Rejecting it is almost equivalent to rejecting verses from the quran. Quran was also transmitted in the same way.Read this also.,islam,ckp4v1i,1,t5_2qhbp
1964822,0,t1_ckptnf3,Oral recitation nevertheless remained the preferred mode of transmission and as time passed variant versions of the text proliferated  the kind of organic change that is endemic to an oral tradition. In addition because of the nature of the early Arabic script in which short vowels were not indicated and consonants of similar form were only sometimes distinguished by pointing writing too was subject to misunderstanding copyists error and change over time. In the early tenth century at Baghdad Abu Bakr Ibn Mujahid d.    succeeded in reducing the number of acceptable readings to the seven that were predominant in the main Muslim centers of the time alMadinah Makkah Damascus alBasrah and alKufah. Some Quran readers who persisted in deviating from these seven readings were subjected to draconian punishments. Nevertheless with the passage of time additional variant readings were readmitted first the three after the seven then the four after the ten. The modern Cairo edition prepared at alAzhar in the s is based on one of the seven readings permitted by Ibn Mujahid that of Abu Bakr sim d. ca.    as transmitted byHafsb. Sulayman d.   .Early efforts by Muslim scholars to establish the sequence of the revelation particularly the verses revealed at Makkah and those revealed at alMadinah were emulated by European scholars who focused on similar problems though often adopting somewhat different criteria for determining solutions.Nevertheless already in the early twentieth century Alphonse Mingana seriously challenged the entire historical framework outlined here.Mingana whose approach was patently tendentiousargued that the Quran had not been codified in book form until several decades later than was generally accepted in the reign of the fifth Umayyad caliph Abd alMalik b. Marwan   . In the s John Wansbrough went much farther concluding on the basis of textual and linguistic analysis that there is no evidence for a canonical version of the Quranic text before the very end of the eighth century at the earliest,islam,ckpynyk,-2,t5_2qhbp

2079290,0,t3_2iopy3,Time space and matter exist and make up the Universe. Whatever created time space and matter that creator existed when there was no time space and matter. Therefore the creator of the Universe is independent of time space and matter.If there was no Universe and then there was a Universe then the cause of the Universe chose for the Universe to exist. Why is there a Universe rather than no Universe? That implies a conscious choice chose for the Universe to exist. So that cause of the Universe makes choices hence has a will.Anything that science finds that could have created the Universe we would simply ask What created that thing that created the Universe? And whatever they give we would only ask that question again until they finally say that thing was timeless. If that thing was timeless and it created the Universe then it created time space and matter and that thing is not dependant on time space and matter. That thing is the same thing as God. And that thing had to choose for the Universe to exist so its alive.A flying spaghetti monster takes up space and depends on space to fly. So a flying speghetti monster could not have created the Universe. Zues was born so he began so he was not there before the Universe was so he didnt create the Universe. Thor has physical hands physical legs physical head physical eyes and physical body so he is a part of matter so he was not the creator of matter.If someone says that my imaginary dragon created the Universe and they say that imagery dragon is independant of time space and matter than that dragon is not a dragon because that dragon has physical hands physical legs and physical wings so it cannot exist before matter existed.If one says  Gods exist or  causes of the Universe exist then we say that if the first entity wanted a planet to stay put and a second entity wanted the planet to move which ever one was able to execute its choice is to be called God and the second is not to be called God. And the second one therefore could not exist before the first one because its choices are not carried out so we neglect that one. This is similar to a religion that claims there are  entities and these  are one. If one says theyre both exactly equal and there is nothing different about them then the second one doesnt exist because its the same as the first one so theres only one in the first place.So we concluded that there is one cause of the Universe that cause existed when time didnt exist so its eternal it cannot have a second or third and it is outside space time and matter so nothing is like that creator. Translate this into Arabic and we get what was already in Surah AlIkhlas of the Qurangt Say He is Allah  who is One Allah  the Eternal Refuge He neither begets nor is born has no partner Nor is there to Him any equivalent.

2126791,0,t3_2jb36g,One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was from a scholar who told me  the hand trains the heartIslam is very much about self discipline. You have to submit your lower self your nafs. Life is not about living by our own whims and doing whatever we feel like. If everyone did that the world would be in chaos as we can see is now happening. My advice to you would be to start slowly and implement one prayer at a time. Make sure that you catch that prayer without any exception. Then after successfully catching that one prayer add another one and another.I used to miss my prayers all the time. Now I have not missed a single prayer in over a year. The first thing that changed that for me was to realize why I was going to be praying in the first place. I had to bring myself to understand who Allah is  and what my relationship is with Him. He has given me everything without my even asking He has accustomed me to nothing but good in my life. I looked around at every single blessing I have and realized these are not spontaneous these are not from my own doing these are not good luck on my part. These are gifts from a most gracious most merciful most loving most generous God. And just as easily as He gave them to me He could take them away. I do not pray because of fear I pray because I am so thankful and out of love.Realizing my blessings made me LOVE Allah and learn to know Him. And no one wants to disappoint someone that they love.Allah has asked us in the Quran to find Him by looking at His signs. Look for the signs in your own life. a Sufi Sheikh taught me something called the  grand. It is a self training exercise for your nafs. What you do is you start doing your daily prayers and you attempt to catch them on time for  days in a row. If you miss even one you start your  days all over again. It took me about  tries before I got it down. And the last one Im still continuing to this day alhumdolillah.Last but not least and in my opinion the most important pray for guidance. Ask the One who created your heart to guide it towards Him with His gentle loving kindness. He is the one who has told us to ask so ask Him for tawfiq.      Yaa Muqallibal Quloob Thabbit Qalbee alaa Deenik.Oh turner of the hearts Allah the Most High keep our hearts firm on your religionAnd know that He wants you. Otherwise why would He ever put it in your heart to draw closer to Him? This is Him wanting you to come closer to Him this is Him desiring good for you He is inviting you to be closer to him.

2131539,0,t1_cla0jku,Youre going off the mistaken assumption that slaves have no rights whatsoever and are entirely the property of the people they are enslaved to. They arent simply owned by another person as you said. By your logic sex between an employer and an employee should be forbidden as well. After all an employer obviously has a great deal of power over their employee and can you it to coerce the employee into having sex with them regardless of whether or not they want to.Society is based off relationships where one person has more power than the other that will always enable coercion. This is a sad truth about society but it cant be done away with entirely. If you would realize that Muslims you talk to hold different assumptions about what you call slavery you might be able to understand and perhaps even respect the positions they hold. Slavery obviously isnt a thing liked by Allah as freeing an enslaved person is encouraged in the Quran and hadiths but there were times when it was necessary.Consider this hadith. Maybe you can rethink your stance on Islamic slavery being equivalent to western chattel slaverygtHe the Holy Prophet said Abu Dharr you are a person who still has the remnants of Ignorance in him. They your servants and slaves are your brothers. Allah has put them in your care so feed them with what you eat clothe them with what you wear. and do not burden them beyond their capacities but if you burden them with an unbearable burden then help them by sharing their extra burden.

2135312,0,t1_cl9z2q9,gt Whats wrong with that verse? It is perfectly fine. Only thing can be problematic about this verse is the word strike or beat depending on the translationI was afraid of this. If you dont get that this verse in the mildest of translation is nothing close to gender equality and if you think the strike part is the only problem then we can have no common ground on womens empowerment. I dont understand why you keep bringing up how Quran gave rights to women that older religions didnt. Ofcourse it did. Every newer religion has done that over the ages. My issue is simply with thinking that that old book is still the best way for women to lead lives today. I am dismayed that I cant convey this after so many attempts. You seem to dislike the desertdweller comment. It was in no way sarcastic. Desert is a tough place to live and if not for the strict code of conduct that Mohamed provided who knows how the middleeast would have progressed. But things have changed slightly since then you might notice.gt Since we cant go back in time we look at the Sunnah or the example of the Prophet. If hitting or striking ones wife was the proper way to deal with conflicts then there would be an example of it. However the Prophet did not treat his wives in such manner.I am tired of this argument of looking at Prophets life. Its lazy and unsophisticated. He also took a  yr old as a wife. He killed every man of Banu Qurayza tribe after they surrendered and took all women and children as slaves AND offered to marry one of them if she converted. Is that ok to do today? I dont think it was terrible that he did because it was a different time but it shows the fault in this Sunnah argument. You are obviously ignoring some of his behavior and opting to follow others not beating wife by applying your own morality which is GREAT! but not foolproof.Im not going to go over the divorce issue since you dont want to read comprehensive articles with citations overwhelmingly from the Quran and hadith and since you want to continue believing that the Quran gives equal divorce rights to women but can provide no quranic verse for it.gt Because youre forgetting to put history into context. The desert dwellers  years ago did things no one else thought of at the time or many many years after. They gave women rights they ended slavery they innovated.History isnt limited to  yrs ago or to your favored region of the world. Every civilization before and after has innovated in many many ways. Centuries before Islam even existed Hindus were inventing the concept of zero organized grammar mathematics surgery medicine and governance along with several terrible ideas. Ancient Greeks came up with the worldchanging idea of democracy and citizen participation. Romans were building engineering marvels and running water and sewage systems before even Christ was born. Algebra is certainly a derived Arabic word but mathematics and algebra was being done in various  parts of the world long before that. This is not to diminish the contributions to knowledge made during the Ottoman empire but its true of almost all flourishing empires throughout history. Each of those thinkers and inventors was influenced by the philosophy of their society and their own religion.gt The Quran talked about life on earth starting in the ocean and Adam went through various morphs. These ideas led Ibn Khaldun to the theory of evolution. These ideas were easily dismissed by the west.Here you go again with the east and west business. The ideas of evolution had been around for a very very long time. I think its quite possible to look at nature and imagine everything to be connected in some way but great thinkers like Ibn Khaldun and many after him did come up with the idea of progression between species. Darwins contribution was to suggest a mechanism by which this could have happened. He called it natural selection after observing how farmers artificially selected crops. Thats why he is popular and others who thought similarly arent. He made predictions about what if observed would prove him wrong. You should really read On the Origin of Species... its quite interesting.That is not to say Ibn Khaldun was a dumdum. He was a great scholar  proposed many theories including in economics that are still credited to him by modern western economists. There are many other impressive Islamic scholars and philosophers that interest me but I have the good fortune to not be biased and I am impressed by nonIslamic philosophers and philosophies too.Its fine to be proud of ones religiouscultural heritage although I dont really understand that feeling afterall I didnt have a choice where I could be born but the world is much more interesting without that feeling.gt I think the United States is more Sharia compliant than any Islamic country. Well I think weve crossed into ridiculous at this point. It is also very close to Ancient Greek governance. And Turkeys laws borrow from Swiss German and French laws more than Sharia. So what.gt The solution isnt to run away from it the solution is to study it properly. To become its pupil. Otherwise we are going to confuse the verse you mentioned for strike or beat and abuse our women.Umm ok. Good luck to you. I read that verse and I say hmm interesting thats how people thought in those days and move on.gt Thus Quran is timeless.

I have seen will you not use your mind to reason? and these are signs for a people who reason so many times in the Quran. In my previous faith questioning things was not encouraged or was shrugged off but in Islam its encouraged and each time my questions have been answered my faith grows stronger.I just love that familial feeling I get when someone says Salaam because even though that person may not know me they are acknowledging my existence and wishing blessings and peace upon me. Thats a beautiful thing that transcends any differences between us and our backgrounds.I feel like Allah takes into account our intentions and efforts our circumstances and flaws. Allah is pleased if we are sincerely trying to meet the standard even if it may not seem like much to someone else. This encourages me to try harder instead of hating myself that I am not perfectly living the deen.I know thats way more than one and lengthy to boot but I couldnt help it!

People are forced to turn to animals because they could not get that love from their own people.

2325862,0,t3_2lxvts,As we have explained in E. N.  of Surah AlBuruj above in retaliation for the persecution of the followers of the Prophet Jesus Christ peace be on him in Najran by the Jewish ruler DhuNuwas of Yemen the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia invaded Yemen and put an end to the Himyarite rule there and in S A. D. this whole land passed under Abyssinian control. This happened in fact through collaboration between the Byzantine empire of Constantinople and the Abyssinian kingdom for the Abyssinians at that time had no naval fleet. The fleet was provided by Byzantium and Abyssinia sent  of its troops by it across the Red Sea to Yemen. At the outset one should understand that all this did not happen under the religious zeal but there were economic and political factors also working behind it and probably these were the real motive and retaliation for the Christian blood was just an excuse. Since the time the Byzantine empire had occupied Egypt and Syria it had been trying to gain control over the trade going on between East Africa India Indonesia etc. and the Byzantine dominions from the Arabs who had been controlling it for centuries so as to earn maximum profits by eliminating the intermediary Arab merchants. For this purpose in  or  B. C. Caesar Augustus sent a large army under the Roman general Aelius Gallus which landed on the western coast of Arabia in order to intercept and occupy the sea route between southern Arabia and Syria. See map of this trade route on p.  of The Meaning of the Quran vol. iv. But the campaign failed to achieve its objective on account of the extreme geographical conditions of Arabia. After this the Byzantines brought their fleet into the Red Sea and put an end to the Arab trade which they carried out by sea with the result that they were left only with the land route. To capture this very land route they conspired with the Abyssinian Christians and aiding them with their fleet helped them to occupy Yemen.The Arab historians statements about the Abyssinian army that invaded Yemen are different. Hafiz Ibn Kathir says that it was led by two commanders Aryat and Abrahah and according to Muhammad bin Ishaq its commander was Aryat and Abrahah was included in it. Then both are agreed that Aryat and Abrahah fell out Aryat was killed in the encounter and Abrahah took possession of the country then somehow he persuaded the Abyssinian king to appoint him his viceroy over Yemen. On the contrary the Greek and Syrian historians state that when after the conquest of Yemen the Abyssinians started putting to death the Yamanite chiefs who had put up resistance one of the chiefs named AsSumayfi Ashwa whom the Greek historians call Esymphaeus yielded to the Abyssinians and promising to pay tribute obtained the Abyssinian kings warrant to be governor over Yemen. But the Abyssinian army revolted against him and made Abrahah governor in his place. This man was the slave of a Greek merchant of the Abyssinian seaport of Adolis who by clever diplomacy had come to wield great influence in the Abyssinian army occupying Yemen. The troops sent by the Negus to punish him either warned him or were defeated by him. Subsequently after the death of the king his successor was reconciled to accept him as his vice regent of Yemen.The Greek historians write him as Abrames and the Syrian historians as Abraham. Abrahah perhaps is an Abyssinian variant of Abraham for its Arabic version is Ibrahim.This man through passage of time became an independent ruler of Yemen. He acknowledged the sovereignty of the Negus only in name and described himself as his deputy. The influence he wielded can be judged from the fact that after the restoration of the dam of Marib in  A. D. he celebrated the event by holding a grand feast which was attended by the ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor king of Iran king of Hirah and king of Ghassan. Its full details are given in the inscription that Abrahah installed on the dam. This inscription is extant and Glaser has published it.For further details see E. N.  of the commentary of Surah Saba.After stabilizing his rule in Yemen Abrahah turned his attention to the objective which from the very beginning of this campaign had been before the Byzantine empire and its allies the Abyssinian Christians i. e. to spread Christianity in Arabia on the one hand and to capture the trade that was carried out through the Arabs between the eastern lands and the Byzantine dominions on the other. The need for this increased because the Byzantine struggle for power against the Sasanian empire of Iran had blocked all the routes of the Byzantine trade with the East.To achieve this objective Abrahah built in Sana the capital of Yemen a magnificent cathedral called by the Arabian historians alQalis alQullais or alQulais this word being an Arabic version of the Greek word Ekklesia church. According to Muhammad bin Ishaq after having completed the building he wrote to the Negus saying I shall not rest until I have diverted the Arabs pilgrimage to it.Ibn Kathir writes that he openly declared his intention in Yemen and got it publicly announced. He in fact wanted to provoke the Arabs into doing something which should provide him with an excuse to attack Makkah and destroy the Kabah. Muhammad bin Ishaq says that an Arab enraged at this public proclamation somehow went into the cathedral and defiled it. Ibn Kathir says this was done by a Quraishite and according to Muqatil bin Suleman some young men of the Quraish had set fire to the cathedral. Either might have happened for Abrahahs proclamation was certainly provocative and in the ancient preIslamic age it cannot be impossible that an Arab or a Quraishite youth might have been enraged and might have defiled the cathedral or set fire to it. But it may well also be that Abrahah himself got this done secretly by his own agent so as to have an excuse for invading Makkah and thus achieving both his objectives by destroying the Quraish and intimidating the Arabs. In any case whatever happened when the report reached Abrahah that the devotees of the Kabah had thus defiled his cathedral he swore that he would not rest until he had destroyed the Kabah.So in  or  A. D. he took  troops and  elephants according to another tradition  elephants and set off for Makkah. On the way first a Yamanite chief Dhu Nafr by name mustering an army of the Arabs resisted him but was defeated and taken prisoner. Then in the country of Khatham he was opposed by Nufail bin Habib alKhatham with his tribe but he too was defeated and taken prisoner and in order to save his life he accepted to serve him as guide in the Arab country. When he reached near Taif Bani Thaqif felt that they would not be able to resist such a big force and feeling the danger lest he should destroy the temple of their deity Lat too their chief Masud. came out to Abrahah with his men and he told him that their temple was not the temple he had come to destroy. The temple He sought was in Makkah and they would send with him a man to guide him there. Abrahah accepted the offer and Bani Thaqif sent Abu Righal as guide with him. When they reached alMughammas or al Mughammis a place about  miles short of Makkah Abu Righal died and the Arabs stoned his grave and the practice survives to this day. They cursed the Bani Thaqif too for in order to save the temple of Lat they had cooperated with the invaders of the House of Allah.According to Muhammad bin Ishaq from al Mughammas Abrahah sent forward his vanguard and they brought him the plunder of the people of Tihamah and Quraish which included two hundred camels of Abdul Muttalib the grandfather of the Holy Messenger of Allah upon whom be His peace. Then he sent an envoy of his to Makkah with the message that he had not come to fight the people of Makkah but only to destroy the House i. e. the Kabah. If they offered no resistance there would be no cause for bloodshed. Abrahah also instructed his envoy that if the people of Makkah wanted to negotiate he should return with their leading chief to him. The leading chief of Makkah at that time was Abdul Muttalib. The envoy went to him and delivered Abrahahs message. Abdul Muttalib repliedWe have no power to fight Abrahah. This is Allahs House. If He wills He will save His House. The envoy asked him to go with him to Abrahah. He agreed and accompanied him to the king. Now Abdul Muttalib was such a dignified and handsome man that when Abrahah saw him he was much impressed he got off his throne and sat beside him on the carpet. Then he asked him what he wanted. Abdul Muttalib replied that he wanted the king to return his camels which he had taken. Abrahah said I was much impressed when I saw you but your reply has brought you down in my eyes you only demand your camels but you say nothing about this House which is your sanctuary and the sanctuary of your forefathers. He replied I am the owner of my camels and am requesting you to return them. As for the House it has its own Owner He will defend it. When Abrahah said that He would not be able to defend it against him Abdul Muttalib said that that rested between Him and him. With this Abdul Muttalib left Abrahah and he restored to him his camels.,islam,clz6uvs,3,t5_2qhbp

Similarly if a Christian points out something in the Quran that looks contradictory to them it wont to you. Its a problem I think we need to work on. And a recurring one.

Science is science science doesnt discover science. It doesnt discover itself. The discovery of a gene is science. It was discovered through trial and error through the scientific method and this is science. But someone or a group of people did the actions. gtNever said religious people cant do science just saying the religion they practiced had nothing to do with the discovery. Thats exactly what Im saying. But to treat religious people as scientifically illiterate is false. The majority of scientists are religious and that is fact.

2391293,0,t1_cm789no,The translation I was referring to was the one you picked for the Quran not the tafsir  commentary attached to it which by the way is just human opinion. All I said was that Asads Quran translation amp commentary are the one I prefer for the most part. I never said it was perfect.For example I may feel like the aggressive stance taken by certain English translations of the Quran and the commentaries of ibn Kathir ibn Abas etc. is wrong here but I also feel that Asads rendering of  and his attempts to justify domestic violence are also wrong. See what I mean?Now what reason do I have to go against a particular translation of the Quran  the Quran is protected from error translators and their work are not!  and the opinions of the people you quote? Conscience reason and Quranic harmony for a start. Second as I said above theyre just people. Famous people sure but not inerrant. Were free to critique and even disagree with them we just need evidence to support our claims.Honestly I personally feel that one of the reasons the Quran was rendered in Arabic specifically is because one word can have so many meanings  finding the right one is a test of how much you want to follow the right path with respect to religion every bit as much as keeping salat fulfilling your oaths etc.Oh and as far as conquest goes you cant or shouldnt anyway just decide one day to start taking land and establish a caliphate! You have to already hold the land legitimately. Land  territory you gain in a just war is one thing but simply taking territory preemptively is something else altogether.

2399535,0,t1_cm89c5p,Theres no evidence that a deity fine tuned this world. The universe is near infinite. The number of stars planets galaxies etc is beyond comprehension. Its possible just one little planet in this masive massive universe had the perfect conditions for life. And its possible that no other planet or other body has ever had life nor will it have.Think about your life. All the experiences you have had the number of people you have impacted how many lives you changed etc. But you were the result of a sperm that was one infinitesimally small meaurement of time faster than the  million sperm that were competing with it. A tiny bit slower and it would have been viceliov instead. You would never have existed. Everything you know have experienced have done would never have happened. It just so happened that the spermegg combination created you. So if you are a world within yourself your world would never have existed. The fortunate combination of the perfect eggsperm combo plus many other factors including all your ancestors created you. The slightest change in any of that and you would never had existed. One of your ancestors perhaps  years ago choosing to delay sex by a few seconds on a certain day meant that you and all your ancestors would never have existed  a completely different set of humans would have existed in your place. The world wasnt fine tuned by an external power for you to exist rather a perfect storm of things happened to create you and your ancestors.BTW as i wrote this I realized how crude this might have sounded. I truly apologize for that!! I dont want to erase it because it illustrates my point. So apologies again!!Edit Got this from the web just to highlight the vastness of the universe gtWith at least  billion galaxies out there and possibly even more were very likely talking about a Universe filled with around  planets or for those of you who like it written out around  planets in our observable Universe.If  out of  planets in this universe has life I wouldnt call that fine tuned Id call it law of averages. ,islam,cm8agwx,1,t5_2qhbp

Even if you have faith that they are true there is no evidence for it.gtnow you are saying that he wrote Quran and followed the rhyming pattern of other religious books ?He didnt write the Quran other people did. And he interacted with many other poets in his time Jewish and otherwise so it makes sense that he heard stories recited.And Im not Christian so Im not going to defend Christianity. I dont care one way or another if anything is accurate. But the last verse of the Book of Revelations does indeed warn against trying to alter it saying that God will punish you harshly for it. And the Catholic Church has many of the original documents for the New Testament still intact and available to view on their website.But youre right I have no reason to make you believe something you dont want to believe.

By your same logic Scientology is true unless you can prove how Hubbard came up with his religion. Same with Joseph Smith and Mormonism. Unless I see some form of evidence that a holy book is true then I have no reason to believe it.He made it up. So youre suggesting he made it up as he went along that too in a prose that is so deep and complex it created grammar rules by itself?...the question is HOW. How can an illiterate trader in the middle of desert who by all accounts was NOT a poet NOT a theological or a philosophical person NOT a linguist come up with Quran? We go back to either A he was schizophrenic or B he was actually a learned scholar a theologian an extremely gifted poet well versed in all  different poetic meters of Arabia. NONE of it is true.gtNow if your arguement is that the Quran is infallible and that the only way to discredit Islam is to discredit the Quran then by extension you are claiming it is impossible that Islam is false which is an absurd claim and severs all possibility of further discussion.Quran is infallible because all other options of claiming it as forgery as exhausted. I can easily talk about L Ron Hubbards career as a fiction writer his terrible stint in the army and how he himself claimed that Dianetics is all made up to discredit Scientology and I can talk about the Americanpolitics infused Mormonism its deeply Americanexceptionalism philosophy to discredit its universalism. Any religion that says people of certain color are not invited in its temple is not a religion of God in my opinion.Just as easily as you found skepticsanointedquran you can find a website that counters all of its claims. Or watch anyone of ton of youtube videos. I wont get into that. But even better than that instead of that why not read Quranic verses and read their exegesis That way you wont have to rely on someone elses word.gtI am not letting it cloud my clarity. I am realizing that if something sounds absurd it probably is. Absurd claims require more evidence of their truth than more believable claims. If I claim I have a black pen in my pocket you probably have little reason to disbelieve. It requires little evidence to take me at my word. However if I claim there is a flying unicorn on Venus then you would require that I provide a lot more evidence than my word before you would believe it. That is because the more absurd the claim the less likely it is to be true.I agree that the more fantastical claims the more evidence is needed. What Im saying is Quran claims fantastical claims and it does so in such an amazing rhetorical succinct yet eloquent manner its very hard to believe an unassuming merchant in the middle of th century Arabia can come up with it especially after we examine his life and anecdotesevidence from his contemporaries.gtThe most likely from my point of view is he had good intentions but was simply wrong whether on purpose or by accident I dont claim to know.He couldnt have been wrong...if he was wrong about anything his adversaries would have jumped on it in an instant.

Buddhas discourses were orally recited much like Islams although for around  years or so. So you might see somethings in the different branches and subsects where theres more myth type stuff because of cultural and preBuddhist religion getting in and thats not necessarily a bad thing. You might even see some sects of Buddhism that seem really close to the Abrahamic religions with a heaven like thing. But as far as I know there are still no sects that believe Buddha was given his power by a God. Especially when Buddhists believe gods are part of the possible reincarnations.,islam,cmskhgt,1,t5_2qhbp

2572778,0,t3_2p8mrj,Basically the idea is not equality but what Islam calls fairness. Its the same logic that white enslavers in America used on blacks that it was their fair position or role in life to be slaves and subservient to the white man. When emancipation came it was the same type of argument. The black mans fair role was at the back of the bus using separate and worse off facilities and generally segregated and still subservient to the white.Its womens role to be subservient to men in Islam. To be needing a man in securing marriage to divorce to travel she has to be accompanied by a man. A womans inheritance being less than a mans is explained by this idea of proper roles again. Ditto for a womans testimony being worth less than mans.The hadiths are full of colorful sayings of the Prophet like that women are inherently deficient intellectually and because of that the majority of women in Hell will be women,islam,cmuefbh,-6,t5_2qhbp

2581570,0,t1_cmvbr8v,Brother I accept the quote of ibn Qayyim. But you have to also accept what I quoted you of the Imam. As well I know the context its if they cease their kufr and dibelief. Not cease fighting. Here is ibn Kathirs RH tafsirSay to those who have disbelieved if they cease... the disbelief defiance and stubbornness they indulge in and embrace Islam obedience and repentance.    their past will be forgiven. along with their sins and errors. It is recorded in the Sahih AlBukhari that Abu Wail said that Ibn Masud said that the Messenger of Allah said                He who becomes good in his Islam will not be punished for what he has committed during Jahiliyyah before Islam. He who becomes bad in his Islam will face a punishment for his previous and latter deeds. I dont want to get into a debate just go to your scholars and ask them. We really cant just deny offensive jihad. Like I told you lets ignore postSahaba Caliphates even though if they werent offensive jihad that would mean they wee murderers which nobody would claim. The Sahaba themselves conquested and vastly expanded the Islamic State.Like I said for those nations on the frontiers of the Caliphate they were asked to embrace Islam pay the jizya disgraced like Allah says in the Quran or be fought. The only people who were not fought is those the Sahaba did not have the means to fight or those who were in a contractual treaty with them.Otherwise really everybody was fair game. Thats the Sahaba the best of the best. And on his death bed our Messenger SAW said to not delay the army of Usama ibn Zaid RA  times the army that went to conquer As Shaam. On his death bed SAW.Now you claim we dont need to do that anymore I agree to an extent that right now in  there is no offensive jihad because we need a Caliph. But once the Caliphate returns then like the past for  years offensive jihad will continue. There is a concept called Izharudeen complete domination and victory to the deen. This is why the Sahaba did what they did.gt Nowadays why would you want to fight to bring the message of Islam when its available for allOkay they allow Islam to be preached but what is the law they rule by?

2597674,0,t3_2pkp83, Convert. Roman Catholic Mexican style of worship is a bit different from other Roman Catholic worship. I converted because I didnt feel right prayingbowing to a statue of the Virgin Mary. I didnt believe Jesus was God or in saints.  I was also very interested in Egyptian culture which lead to me to study Islam more.  Good intentions prayer jihad of the self working towards jannah. I dont understand this question but I will attempt to answer. My religion offers a means to avoid societal issues by having a system for marriage divorce guidelines for how to interact with family and others.  Maybe a fundamental problem humans face is that we are crazy? The call to prayer and prayer. The call to prayer is a very powerful thing emotionally because it is like it shakes our soul into reminding us that we must pray we have to. Prayer is also spiritually significant because it is like clearing our soul and mind to just focus on connecting with Allah.  As a woman it is difficult to follow hijab in a nonMuslim majority region. Where I was living before discrimination happened often and was kind of the norm. I wasnt getting hired for jobs and received threats when waiting at bus stops. Another challenging is praying  times a day because I cant pray publicly or at work I would have to go home or wait till work was over since there wasnt a Mosque in my area.  Yes lots of discrimination and harassment when I wore hijab. I applied to work at my university the first time I was interviewed I went in wearing hijab and didnt get hired. I applied again for the same position same employer everything the same except I went in without hijab and I got hired. When I got hired I went to turn in my forms to the HR representative who kept demanding to see my visacitizen card which I had no idea wtf that was. I kept saying I was born in the US and I have my passport to prove identity he didnt believe me yelled at me and kicked me out of his office. I went to the same HR office later that day without hijab and he accepted my papers without problem and gave me a candy cane.I had my hijab yanked nearly off when walking around my university campus. When waiting to cross the street once these  guys behind me started calling me rag head and said they were going to push me into oncoming traffic. When taking the bus people wouldnt sit next to me sometimes I would get trash thrown at me from people in seats behind  a few times a driver didnt want to let me on the bus a few times some guys would stalk me off the bus and tell me they want to unwrap me I had habib yelled at me a few times which no one really knows what habib and habibe mean lol all sorts of stuff. I ended up not wearing hijab in the US anymore got too scary for me. No one has a problem with me wearing abaya though.  Most people believe all Muslims are Arab which is entirely untrue. We dont pray or worship the Prophet Mohammed he was just a cool guy. We also dont worship cows and neither do Hindus. Yeah I believe it is the only true and uncorrupted faith. I think Judaism Christianity and Islam all hold truth but the first  got distortedcorrupted over time.

The prohibition on extramarital sex is more to do with the consequences for the participants and the community rather than the acts themselves. Sex with your spouse is a means to demonstrate love learn more about each other comfort each other etc. etc. Dont deprive yourself. Your husband sounds like an understanding man. I recommend you explain your background straightforwardly to him as you have with us and suggest that you both proceed slowly. Dont go from zero to sixty. Introduce physical intimacy bit by bit. First get comfortable kissing and so on. Its important that both husband and wife enjoy sex and quite a few imams have written on the importance of foreplay and the wifes pleasure. Theres a hadith about a man spending all night in worship when he was advised that his wife had a right to him.gtYour body has a right over you your eyes have a right over you and your wife has a right over you. Bukhari Vol. No. Of course sex itself is declared lawful in the Quran  If your father comes from a postcolonialist culture be aware that that has influenced his upbringing and views on sex like many people from his culture. Heres an example. TLDR Shame around sex is an import. May Allah help you attain a compassionate and fulfilling marriage inshallah.,islam,cn72nmv,1,t5_2qhbp

2721100,0,t1_cndd123,gt AGRESSORSSo one of the things nonMuslims do a lot is they take a single verse and then use that as an evidence for or against something. Muslim scholars on the other hand take all of the verses on a topic and combine it with the understanding of the authentic hadith in order to arrive at a conclusion.So for example there is a verse in the quran commands the believers to make a will final will. As for how to go about making the will thats in a completely different portion of the Quran. But if I were to just see the commandment that says Make a will and I say OK! and then go and say my son gets th and my daughter gets  and my cat gets the rest! would that be Islamic? Of course not... because it contradicts how were supposed to go about making wills.Let me provide another example which you may not see as selfdefense. Lets say there is some country X which is isolated from the world. The dictator of said country doesnt allow his citizens to use the internet there is no news actually there isnt even electricity in this country. The citizens worship the supreme ruler and think he is a God more or less. In fact if movies come out depicting bad things about him in other countries entertainment companies might get hacked. All of those people living in said country will never in their lifetimes have an opportunity to be exposed to Islam or well... even any of the rest of the world. Would it be morally acceptable for a legitimately established  righteous  practicing Islamic Caliphate to go to war with this dictator for the purpose of opening the land to the knowledge of Islam?Would you also consider that self defense?gt I dont see why it would be any different between an indivisual and society.The rules of society are different from the rules of an individual. If someone steals from me inside an Islamic society I cannot enact the corporal punishment. No hand chopping period. If I see my wife committing adultry in my house on my bed with my neighbor none of them are getting stoned to death. Rather I have to bring it to the court with the appropriate witnesses etc. and make my case. Then and only then will the courtauthority after examining the evidence arrive at a conclusion of weather or not to enact the hadd punishment. Imagine how crazy society would be even western society if everyone took authority into their own hands and melted out punishments. That sort of vigilante justice isnt acceptable in a society that is ruled by governing authority. That only happens in tribal societies.gt The reason you gave on going to war to battle opression is valid but historically it was not the case for the wars under the first Caliphs.This is exactly why I said there are many more reasons besides just self defense or booty collection. Ill give you a big hint as to what the reason may be. Look up the actual Arabic term that they the first Caliphs as well as historians up until this day use to describe the action they were doing. And then translate it into English. Itll give you a much better incite as to their reasoning for their actions than any conjecture or guessing one can do.,islam,cnddlg5,1,t5_2qhbp

The verses I gave are the ones I was taught and am using them as sources for my reasoning. Please give me other examples regarding the topic at hand instead of giving me info on wills etc. No I believe the example regarding country x north korea isnt a valid reason to go to war over. We are talking about war where many people would die and an entire regime would have to be thrown over. Dont you understand Islam should never be spread by the sword. I know the rules of society and the rules for an indivisual are different but in this case they seem the same unless you have proof otherwise as the quran verses addressed the society at the time.

I would suggest you talk to a local imam about it. Just remember that no one has a monopoly on Islamic understanding and that some things will likely be said that another scholar will disagree with.With that being said you can definitely learn the basic pillars and creed. You can observe a Friday sermon and prayer one of the  daily prayers in congregation or any classes they may have. You can obviously also learn how to pray and make wuduablution.

2759755,0,t1_cnhr1cx,Sure Im currently on mobile so if youd want to give me the evening to get on a computer Id be happy to oblige. I would argue that Islams holy texts are not that splintered at all. You have the Quran which is one book. Then the hadiths which are recounts of how the Prophet acted and those have varying levels of authenticity based on how many people can attest to it. Id argue that Buddhism has one of the most splintered texts and religions. There is no one Bible or whatever. There are hundreds of suttas compiled into a few different canons. But they were only recorded  years after the Buddha died. And they were translated into many languages the main being Pali Sanskrit Tibetan old Chinese and maybe Japanese or Korean. Different Buddhist sects believe in the same basics but you will see many differences. I suggest a visit to the Buddhism subreddit for some of that stuff in the mean time. In Buddhism you will see different interpretations on stuff like rebirth or how you should get to enlightenment. Youll see Zen which focuses much more on meditation than reading suttas for example. Theravada is about reaching complete enlightenment and nibanna while Mahayana is about reaching a high level but not so high as you wont be reborn so you can help people for eternity to reach enlightenment. So right there is a different interpretation. Also different sects hold different Suttas to different regards. So one might see X and Y and the top ones while another might see A and B. Hope that quenches your thirst for the time being. ,islam,cnhrure,1,t5_2qhbp

2764633,0,t1_cnia2z6,I was not intending to say God didnt know what would happen today.God is perfect but he made humans imperfect and gave us free will I dont want to sound blasphemous but Im genuinely wondering if the Quran contains the real words of God or the Prophet whos human wrote Gods words to be intelligible by the people of that time and modified them somehow. Of course Im aware just asking myself this question may be an offence towards Islam and thats not my intention.Im trying to learn more about Islam because personal reasons and you raised a good point about the Quran being a timeless book. Because I have questions.Not only it doesnt look timeless today stoning people was standard procedure that day today is considered barbaric but there are signs that tells me time is not the only issue but also location.Ive learnt that during the Ramadan correct me if Im wrong here you should fast from sunrise till sunset. This should be equal for all Muslims but we know today its not. Different places in the world have different sunlight times.Doing Ramadan in Iceland for example during summer will basically kill you and doing it in winter is pointless because theres no sun.Another example we should pray salat five times every day. This was a big issue for Muslim astronauts because when in space every day on Earth lasted less than an hour so when youre orbitating around Earth you should pray every  minutes and dont let me mention about how hard could it be to pray in the right direction. This issue is serious and will be even more complicated when space travels are going to be a thing.So what I have here is a religion that doesnt work well outside its time doesnt work well outside is native region and simply doesnt work outside its native planet.God is perfect we are not. So what are we missing here? Are we reading the Quran wrong? Is the Quran itself wrong? Are there maybe missing parts kept hidden for future use like the New Testament in the Bible?,islam,cnibtb5,0,t5_2qhbp

I hope that more people will begin to open their eyes and understand that the hatred they are spreading is not helping us move any closer to a peaceful world. Please stay positive. The logical people are listening. ,islam,cnk15b1,2,t5_2qhbp

When the imam teaches you on Friday that kafirs are not worthy of living I have heard enough of this in the Friday afternoon prayers you question him and say there is no compulsion in religion. Thats enough to put out fire in your kitchen. If you listen to that and come home and quietly disagree its not putting out fire. Wahhabi or Salafi islam is good if everyone was Muslim.

2816693,0,t1_cno8nhz,On the most basic level because the Quran says so in .If thats not good enough to think it through prophets are presented to mankind by God to be a source of guidance and more importantly to be a role model.  Sunnis are all about following the sunnah right? Not that Shias dont but just to emphasize the point.  What good is following the sunnah if the person whose sunnah were following committed sins?  If that was the case the things were following could be good or could be bad.  So in order for there to be no excuse on Judgement Day God provided us with examples that didnt sin so that we have no one to point to other than ourselves when we sin.  When we sin we follow no ones example but our own.  Shias believe that when the Prophet Muhammad sawaws passed the torch on to Imam Ali as he took on every role that the Prophet previously held except for the fact that Imams dont receive revelation.  As such he also fulfilled the same role of exemplifying the sunnah of the Prophet in the best way and since the Prophets sunnah was not to sin the Imam and the Imams after him didnt either.,islam,cno91lz,1,t5_2qhbp

2828842,0,t1_cnpg7dl,gtI would say in the West there is consistent pervasive disproportionate criticism of Islam and Islam is most often practised by minority ethnic groups who often wield less power in the mediasocietygovernment.You say this as if all ideas are equal which is logically impossible. If Islam receives a lot of criticism it is because a lot of people take a lot of exception to aspects of it that they do not like which is their right as freedom of opinion. That is not bigoted. The fact that a set of beliefs is practices by a sizeable minority has no bearing on the validity of its criticism.gtThis criticism sometimes resorts to stereotypes untruths or cultural bullying. I think this can lead to a hostile atmosphere particularly at times like this an idea that the Western Muslim somehow ought to justify or apologise for their very existence is an outsider or even a potential traitor. The foreign Muslim for their part is set up as the antithesis of the West backwards and scary. When criticism resorts to racial stereotypes that is racism. However just because some people that dislike Islam are also racists does not mean that all even the majority just have valid concerns about the beliefs. Some people myself included think that Islam is bad for the West  and would rather see it fade out of existence through non violent reasoned argument over the course of decades. If people want to paint Islam as being in conflict with their values they should be free to do so.To me and any other nonmuslim nonracist Islam can be treated like to any other ideology from fascism to communism libertarianism to totalitarianism.

In my case he doesnt know the future he simply just knows. If youre arguing that youre forced to live in this universe then again that wasnt your arguement. Your arguement was someone knowing  what Ill do means I actually dont have a choice because for that person to know  what Ill do means my other options are not possible and therefore not a real choice. In actuality humans can never predict something to such degree of accuracy the only one we would agree that could is god. Now future is a concept of time.

What I learned was that ultimately if Arabic isnt your milk tongue youre learning it through someone elses understandinginterpretation. In regards to the Quran the words never change in Arabic however there are some words that are not directly translatable to English. So learning through a translation is going to have hopefully the basic understanding but lack the depth that is there in Arabic and also the interpretation of person who has translated it.

Isnt it enough that we can define what is good and what is bad by ourselves from a purely subjective standpoint?

Then people put in checks to control that this code is followed and it is changed. Back in the days it was ok to marry what was practically children people who didnt possess the knowledge and experience needed to make rational decisions concerning relationships and marriage. Now it isnt ok. Morality has changed. I would think that there needs to be... chaos? In order for us to evolve.

The use of the past continuous form of the verb suggests that it would occur as a matter of habit.  Bayhaqi has narrated another similar tradition from Jabir after which he said If it were permissible to prostrate on the cloth one is wearing it would certainly be easier to do so than to cool hot sand in ones hands and to use that for prostration.Sunan Abu Dawud  Sunan alKubra Bayhaqi  Sunan alKubra Bayhaqi ,islam,colgfog,0,t5_2qhbp

Muhammad SAW had held their hands and he said The three of us will be raised on the Day of Resurrection in this way.See the difference between Sunni and Shia is what while we acknowledge political differences may have arose between Abu Bakr Umar and Ali we dont consider Ali a hypocrite or usurper and we dont curse any of the companions or declare them hypocrites. Whereas Shia Muslims have no problem declaring Abu Bakr Umar and Aisha as reviled hypocrites a position that can only be achieved by systematically dismissing or declaring as a fabricated conspiracy any narration that espouses the virtues of those companions.

As in a part of religionchange in religion. Something new that is added to religion itself. Not everything is bidah. RelgionIslam has core tenets.  pillars of Islam and the  pillars of Iman. This is what Islam consists of. Any change whatsoever to these or regarding these would constitute bidah. That does not mean things that do not affect these would be considered bidah because they are not affecting nor changing Islams tenets whatsoever. I provided two hadiths actually from sahih bukhari. The rest is explanation in regards to the behavior of the sahaba. All of that is well recorded in the hadithsunnah. Establishing a madrasah andor an Islamic institute of learning is commanded in the Quran? nope. Was it done by the Prophet pbuh? Nope. Was it done by the sahaba? nope. In fact the very first Islamic institution wasis University of alKaraouine established in . By that logic establishing such institutions would be bidah as well since it was never done before that time. Same applies for many many Islamic programs available today. Something that can do good things for the people and can be useful in spreading knowledge about Islam and for the love of Allah swt and the Prophet pbuh without changing or affecting Islam cannot by definition be considered an innovation since it isnt affecting the religion.  ,islam,cp3dx0l,6,t5_2qhbp

Military interventions are political decisions not military. Once the military is committed through no choice of its own would you prefer that a group of ignorant xenophobic soldiers is let loose or rather a group that has had interactions with Muslim service members and better understands the religion and culture? Better yet wouldnt it be more preferable that the soldiers and leadership therein contained Muslims as well and were able to positively influence situation on the ground preventing possible hate crimes and war crimes against the locals?Ideally Muslim representation in the legislature should be increased to prevent these interventions in the first place.

3414889,0,t1_cph0hnv,gtOur view is very similar to theirs. We believe in the Qadr of AllahSwt and we also believe that Dua to Allahswt allows him to grant us changes. What they are discussing is if you can justify Good or bad committed by the rich who say its all Qadr. There are divine decrees and there are things that we humans are the cause of. If I get a speeding ticket I cant blame AllaHSwt and say today Allahswt is not happy with me. That was all me I did the speeding and I have to pay for its consequences.No they specifically deny Qadr i.e. predestination and then continue to talk about the ills of predestination within the three links I gave you. We as Muslims believe in fixed Qadr and conditional Qadr in which dua protects us from. At the same time we believe Allah azza wa jal knows what we will do what we have done and what we would have done. He is Allknowing and everything that we have done and our place in Hell and Heaven have already been determined. This is the belief of Sunnis and the Shias do not believe this.Heres a quote from the link I providedgtIt may look more surprising if we think of the divine aspect of fate and destiny for a change in this aspect implies a change in the celestial world in the angelic tablets and books and in the Divine Knowledge. So can Allahs Knowledge still undergo a change? The surprise reaches its height when we admit that certain terrestrial affairs especially human will and actions cause changes in the celestial world and the angelic record.gt...gtIs the Knowledge of Allah changeable? Is a divine decree revocable? Can an inferior influence a superior?gtThe answer to these questions is in the affirmative. Yes the Knowledge of Allah is changeable. In other words Allah has such knowledge also which is changeable. A divine decree is revocable. In other words Allah has decrees which are revocable. An inferior can influence a superior. A lower system especially the will desire and human acts can shake the higher world and cause changes in it. This is the highest form of mans control of his destiny.Each claim that the author makes is huge in Aqeedah and shows how deviated they are. Allahs Knowledge is changeable authoo billah. Allah is AllKnowing so how can he change his knowledge. He is aware of all things.  A divine decree is revocable? If it has been decreed than nothing can change it. If it is a conditional decree then it can be changed but even then Allah azza wa jal has decreed that one will make or not make the dua. However knowledge of all actions that we do and what we will do and how we will do it and where we will end up is encompassed within the Knowledge of Allah azza wa jal and has been written already.We also believe in free will but we can not blame Allah azza wa jal for our mistakes because just because he knows and has written down what we will do does not mean we know what he has written or what we will do. We are inevitably making our own choices.  Things that we as humans cause are not without the permission of Allah azza wa jal and were similarly written down already. When Allah azza wa jal says we caused something it is because of our own actions that something bad happened to us but Allah azza wa jal knew said thing would happen and allowed it to happen.gtNot created by humans but by AllahSwt.Saying it is created is the problem. Saying it is created by humans is kufr. Saying it is created by Allah azza wa jal is deviance because the implication that a trait his Speech in this case of Allah azza wa jal is created.     All Sunni scholars unanimously state that the Quran in the uncreated Speech of Allah azza wa jal.gthave intentionally or unintentionally asked from our Prophet Muhammadpbuh for what is only Allahswt domain.Except this is not the issue. We are allowed to ask people for things in this world whether they are material or not. We are also allowed to ask others to make dua for us as well.  The issue arises whether one believes the dead can hear or not. Obviously the correct opinion is that the dead cant hear but many scholars have said that the Prophets are alive in their graves and they make the assumption that the prophets can hear those who ask them to ask Allah azza wa jal.  Again I find it incorrect.gtYou cant work towards unity if there is no division. And Im saying complete unity is a farce. Shaikh Yasir Qadhi has said this and so have most scholars including Hamza Yusuf and others. If you are asking for peaceful coexistence yes that is possible. However that does not mean we shouldnt expose their misguidance when they are wrong.  Is it a big issue? No. If someone asks about the Shias or asks what is different about them then it should be brought up.gtBut is it necessary for a lay person as yourself to open a can of worms about the Shia when you havent even gotten your own theology on a lock down.Youre right I dont have my own theology on a lock down so I ask Allah azza wa jal to make me knowledgeable on the Aqeedah of the Prophet SalAllahu alayhi wa salam and his Salaf.gtWhen there are people like this around I feel that the lay sunnis should pull back a little and let the Shia live.And there are Shias that want the Sunnis dead as well see Iraq especially Baghdads ethnic cleansing of Sunnis and Syria.gtBut I wont bring up the shia out of no where stating that The people need to know the truth about them.I did not bring them up out of nowhere.

This implies that you think everyone in America is brainwashed by the mainstream news channels and I know very few people who take Fox News and similar infotainment seriously.edit to speculate why some people think this way  I suspect it has to do with fear of the unknown. Most of those people dont have interactions with Muslims on a daily basis and fail to see the peaceful beautiful human sides of Muslims. Mainstream media certainly plays a part in that but I think truly Islamophobic people are that way because of lack of education and experience with people in general.

3472505,0,t1_cpnr2ih,Wow detailed response. Thanks gtQuestion is not well posed. Capitalism and secularism are VERY different things and the two concepts are not coupled at all. I refer you to the Tea Party in the US that firmly believes in a libertarian free market capitalism and are definitely NOT secular. See Im not from the US. But I would assume that the tea party being in the US is a Christian party. I would still affirm that this is secular solely because Christianity has been secularised it is only a belief and unlike an ideology like Islam it has no answer for economic judiciary  politics and war. Whereas Islam does. Previously the church did run the state but did it do so from the source ie the bible ? No. It was justified by their state figures the solution was from men because the bible doesnt tackle the worldly problems. Thus even the churchstate was secular and so is the tea party  to my calculationsgtSecular Yes I am secular. I am an atheist exmuslim actually and have renounced all forms faith. I believe in freedom but vehemently believe in a secular govt and society. What people in their own homes is their business. Dont harm dont force others be evidence based not faith based. With secularism my problem is with its thinking . Sure scientific thinking is well grounded  it establishes the existence its properties and its effects of objectssubjects in the lab. It is one of the branches of rationalism. However  I find it hard to apply that to fields other than empirical knowledge. Ie is there a god ? How do you measure something that is unmeasurable ? Isnt their an assumption that all things that exist must be material. How do we measure this assumption?Whats the meaning to life ? Etc. Science can only get us so far. Secularism is just another term for materialism. Separating mythology from material governing. Why should your hokey pokey be involved in our every day lives huh?! well every society has ideas and beliefs that it propagates some of it as insecure as religion . gtI also believe in freedom. Free to live how we want to say what we want to study  and be whatwho we want to. Of course there are some limits  with those limits being when I infringe upon the freedoms of others or harm others.Freedom IMO being one of the thoughts of capitalistic secularism is one of them. Its a concept worth believing but laws are the limit to freedom So if freedom can be limited then what does it even mean ? Why would you be talking about it ? The West talks about freedom a lot  but by your definition  everyone in every country is free! Its bizarre. I would agree with john Stuarts mills freedoms but it still stands your not really free to freely do whats you want because  you will get punished for it contradicting the will of the govt. either you limit your own freedom or wants  or get your freedom limited. Lol. Philosophically it doesnt make sense politically  freedom is everywhere limited by the systems. Economically ? in this capitalistic era  we have freedom of ownership ownership instinct. I am free but I sell my body my time and my labour in order to make some money to freely own stuff. Damn mayn. Capitalism will allow you to die If you dont work because you are disabled etc. Islam gaaruntees the minimal of good clothes and shelter.  The west only introduced State benefit because it was afraid people would adopt communism who appealed to the proletariat and the poor otherwise capitalism would be a strong kill all society. With communism dead I wouldnt be Surprised if they take it all back and privatise everything.gtThats what govtlawsmorals are for. But apart from those constraints I believe in freedom absolutely. And yes to a large extent and with faults of course it does exist. And the broader point is not whether the west in absolute is better now than other systems its that the system of democracy allows for change  thus the faults in the system by god there are many can be addressed and historically they have. One can talk about the treatment of blacks in the USA but to say that the system has not improved for them is disingenuous. Had the treatment of blacks been theologically based then segregation etc would still be with us today. America was founded as a republic. Capitalisms somehow changed it into a democracy. Islam from its conception banned racism. Islam doesnt justify racism from its inception. The west had. The west just reacts and reacts and reacts. To the church to womens rights to race segregation. Islam is an ideology that has say down thought and decided. Where as the criteria in the west is benefit. It benefits me to invade Iraq etc. Islam has halal and haram as its measure. The west has benefit. Homosexuality doesnt harm capitalism. Its cool. Get income tax from the poor that benefits capitalism. Major corporations evading tax thats cool its capitalism. You know the deal ! It just allows crap based on benefit  profit.Democracy is based on the principle where each man has equal influence to society. Two heads is better than one more heads is better than two. People dont have equal influence. Hell media influences people. You just believe you have equal influence. Adding to that capitalism has got you running on the hamster wheel. Might as well let those who have the time and the knowledge to seek out solutions. Except theres mass poverty in the us  mill in the us according to wiki the middle class are to busy working leaving in to activists and politicians. That leaves the rich to decide and hey you have an oligarchy and a plutocracy otherwise known as capitalism.There is one god. I believe Islam is the truth that appeals to mans innate nature and it would satisfy it intellectually. Islam would solve the worlds ills. On a lighter note.I try out things that I believe I dislike to see if I can remove any boxes I have of my personality.i had bitter melon yesterday and I vomited eating it a couple years ago lol I even try to like the things In scared of like suede. Ive overcome that fear too. I hate when people say they are x because I was x before and carry on being x. Yallah! I think this pet peeve and Karl popper a philosopher of science and scientist himself taught me the ways of falsification show something to be wrong once and it cannot be true. I just want to know the truth man andHeres some of islams solution No interest  so the economic divide wont increase. No hoarding land to restrict supply and thus increase price. Limiting sexual advertisements and the like so that men wont go out commuting zina having children outside of marriage which leads to children with no male role model which is IMO the biggest societal problem cause.a society appreiciative of truth. Not on compromise secularism. Apostates would have to debate the best in the fields in order to leave Islam ie Islam would have to be proved to be insatisfiable intellectually before one apostates. If the motive is pleasure then he wouldnt leave. If its for the truth  then he does for the truth.money is physically backed. Banks cant conjure up invisible money and cant lend  times the invisible money they have.My aim here is to show Islam shouldnt be secularised  its place is on an ideological plane. And Muslims are victimised. Oppressed. Maybe not on the physical level. But on an ideological level. Many times on tv where a Muslim is being interviewed about a killing hes asked if he condemns the killing in a provocative way. And the UK is more liberal than the us when it comes to these things. gtBut they dont. Instead when interviewed examples are many just look them up some moderate representative will refuse to condemn theological edicts like a hadith or a law in sharia that makes everyone think well these guys clearly believe that a husband can rape his wife then...You see this is my original point. Islam allows a husband to lightly hit a wife. Why should a Muslim renounce sahih hadith because it doesnt make sense to you and the west ? To prove Islam is wrong rationally is one thing to say its wrong because of opinion is another.  And this is situation I want to avoid as Muslims. Because the majority have an opinion that dislikes Islam people will hide the sharia and Sell out Muslims will condemn and reform Islam and become uncle toms to please the west. In the end we are not western. We are humans and Muslims at the end of the day why should peaceful Muslims as a group be seen as terrorists every time one guy does something stupid. Yes he says Allah hu alhbar before. That just says more about the dude then Islam. Why is that so hard to understand? How come a brown guy does something bad and the rest of us look like f ups. A white guy does something dumb and they say hes crazy? I dont think its dont on purpose its just hostility to a rival hostility. ,islam,cpo3a36,1,t5_2qhbp

3529743,0,t1_cpucejk,Hello brother !This verse is where Allah SWT is encouraging the people to convert to Islam because when you convert to Islam all your past sins are forgiven. Read the next ayah after the one I posted.gt O Prophet say O My servants who have wronged their own souls Do not despair of Allahs mercy surely Allah forgives all sins He is the AllForgiving the AllMerciful. Return to your Lord and submit to Him before the scourge overtakes you and then you may get no help from anywhere...Allah is saying dont despair over your past sins because He forgives your past sins when you convert.Taken from the tafseergt The address here is to all mankind. There is no weighty argument to regard only the believers as the addressees. As has been observed by Allama Ibn Kathir to address such a thing to the common men does not mean that Allah forgives all sins without repentance but Allah Himself has explained in the following verses that sins are forgiven only when the sinner turns to Allahs worship and service and adopts obedience to the message sent down by Him. As a matter of fact this verse brought a message of hope for those people who had committed mortal sins like murder adultery theft robbery etc. in the days of ignorance and had despaired whether they would ever be forgiven. To them it has been said Do not despair of Allahs mercy whatever you might have done in the past if you sincerely turn to your Lords obedience you will be forgiven every sin. The same interpretation of this verse has been given by Ibn Abbas Qatadah Mujahid and Ibn Zaid. Ibn Jarir Bukhari Muslim Abu Daud Tirmidhi. For further explanation see AIFurqan  and the E.N.s thereof. If you are not satisfied with the answer please make a post about it there are many people on this subreddit who are very wellversed in the Quran who can give you the proper interpretation and understanding which I may not be able to provide.

3543079,0,t3_30uvvh,Ok I feel like I can be of some relevance here. A little intro I am married to a convert Im Pakistani American shes Italian American. I am  almost  as well. Meeting converts depends on a decent amount of factors. Location personality social openness etc. One of the best places would be at one of the larger masjids. Those would be the ones where many converts both men and women would be going to. You could meet them there. If you have friends andor family you can let them know of your preference and ask them if they know someone they could introduce you to. Try to narrow your search down on the internet sites by your own location. Do not expect a flood of requests immediately. These things require patience and time. Now onwards to a bit more in depth information. First and foremost having preferences is fine but make sure if you really want to get married to a convert in a genuine sense or just for a thrill. Contemplate about that with yourself. Secondly remember that converts often come from different cultures and backgrounds. If they are fully willing and are interested in your culture then that is all fine. However under no circumstances expect them to adjust or change to your culture by default. Dont forget personalities and personal views and likesdislikes can sometimes be affected by culture as well so if you are more strict in that regard then that is something to rethink about.,islam,cpw4tpn,5,t5_2qhbp

There is also Hadith stating that the best men are those who are best to their wives. The Prophet Muhammad pbuh was never abusive toward his wives. Islam requires us to use common sense  if you take all that information into account and honestly believe that it is rationalizes spousal abuse then you have got a pretty messed up view of the world.,islam,cq1lxo2,4,t5_2qhbp

3628768,0,t3_31xgay,salam awalakeum ? may Allah reward you in shaa Allah for attempting to seek knowledge.i hope i can answer your question well.. and .there was a video i watched where a speaker said atheists can go to heaven. i personally dont buy it. shirk is never forgiven and good is defined by Islam  even the prophets pbuh uncle who protected the prophet pbuh through the early years was sent to hell.  i say this with a mother who is christian may Allah guide her in shaa Allah.. muslims asks scholars to understand whether an action is halal or haram. would you know if your mother sister is allowed to attend yours ? she is not and i learnt about this recently lol.  somethings are not common sense but are results of alot of extracting from the islamic texts. i do agree with you however. alot of people ask scholars questions that require analysing and understanding the real world. for example is human cloning halal or haram? the scholar would have to understand what human cloning is in detail and then understanding the texts that deal with this issue before giving an opinion on its legitimacy. however many scholars dont attempt to understand the world first and just give an opinion based on the knowledge of the religion they hold. an example question is what is the problem of the ummah. as scholars naturally they see it as lack of knowledge lack iman etc. But in actual reality the problem is a political one we have no khalif to unite us to free palestine to give refuge to the oppressed.  etc .muslims dont hate non muslims. our relationship with them is dawah so we cannot hate. they have not been exposed to islam yet. so we should be patient do what we can invite them to Islam and fear Allah for they may account you for passing them the message.. As muslims our role in the dunya is to seek the pleasure of Allah and the attainment of Jannah in shaa allah. so naturally our measurement of our actions and our time is not fununfunhelps social life etc. our measurements for our actions should be halal and haram and since our knowledge of halal and haram may be limited we asks the scholars ! back to q !,islam,cq5woat,0,t5_2qhbp

3635725,0,t1_cq6o5tb,Sure if you are currently denying Islam simply on hubris then thats a bad thing.  Rejecting something not on its merits but because you are too proud of yourself and stature is not just something looked down upon by God but also pretty much anyone around you.  Not a good trait to have. However as far as your question is concerned none of this matters.  We dont know our end state with God so assuming how youve been created and how youll never change is pointless.  You just dont know what the future holds for you.  This is basically an attempt to remove responsibility for your own actions by claiming fate made me do it when you have no idea what fate actually has in store. Additionally we are all created with good and bad traits.  Excessive pride is definitely something Islam came to help with.  I think the problem is you are assuming Islam is just a big book of external regulations.  The large majority of it is focused on reinventing your inner self.  If you have a problem with hubris then Islam definitely does offer good sound advice.,islam,cq6p7s2,4,t5_2qhbp

I actually just researched it and am not going to offer it to him because I saw that it has been fermented and alcohol removed post fermentation. My buddy and I can kick it with the cola and have a good time that way.I just want to say thank you all again you are a delightful community to talk to. May you all have brilliant lives InshAllah.

I spoke with husbands sister mom and aunt about how I felt disrepected and unappreciated.A few days later still in NJ I woke up in the middle of the night screaming that my hands and feet were numb. I began to go in and out of consciousness. Husband called  paramedics thought I was overdosing on drugs and shrugged it off as a panic attack.This repeated the next night...but it got worse.I was getting ready for bed when suddenly I felt an immense amd overwhelming fear. I became inexplicably terrified of my husband and his family as they tried to calm me.It took five paramedics and six police officers to restrain me on the bed. I was watching this unfold in horror but was in some strange third person mode. Another voice came out of me. I began to speak languages I knew nothing of then into full tongues.I tried to lash out attempting to bite and kick my way free.I was pumped with sedatives that had little effect.I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder and it was determined what I experienced was acute psychosis.I woke up alone in a psychiatric hospital.My husbands family contacted a Maulana and he was convinced I was possessed by an evil Jinn.He performed the Islamic version of an excorcism. This was done three times on three different days due to how badly my symptoms became.I had recurring trauma when I came home and still had to be hospitalized. The medicine only amplified my symptoms so I no longer used it.My family and my husband were perplexed but never connected my marital stress to my anxiety attacks. Because of this it was subsequently swept under the rug.My husband was still abusive even worse when we came home from vacation.I threatened to divorce him.

You already have your knowledge of Islam and youre happy with it. To you you know all about Islam. The difference friend is that a member of the KKK explicitly tells you they hate black people. They want to purge all black people. I dont want to kill you. Youre not even a Muslim so the rule doesnt even apply to you. Islams moral stand point is that homosexual intercourse is wrong. Just like adultery and premarital sex are wrong. Just like drinking alcohol. Its a moral stance. Your moral stance on having sex with a  year old is that its wrong and disgusting. Thats okay. Islam has rules. You want to follow them sure. If not then dont. Youre free. Whats there to be confused about? Bringing up punishments has no place here. I dont live in a country where Homosexuality is punishable with death nor prison time. Neither do you.

The reason I mentioned it in this way is because pretty much all Greek source texts were first translated to Arabic prior to being translated to Latin so its likely that Darwin was inspired by something written in Arabic. Typically when the idea came from an Arab and not a Greek Europeans would claim it as their own idea after all the Arabs are barbaric. I came across this paper havent read it yet but the abstract is fascinating gt Charles Darwin is believed to be the first proponent of theevolutionary theory. This paper theorizes another point ofview in this regard. Many a Muslim philosopher had alreadydiscussed the concept of evolution in their writings prior toDarwin. The preDarwinian Muslim scholars providedsufficient materials to Darwin for his theory of evolutionwho gave it scientific language. John William Draper acontemporary of Darwin called it the MohammadanTheory of Evolution. Darwin himself knew Arabic and hadthe direct access to Arabic literature. He was initiated intoIslamic Culture in the Faculty of Religion at the Universityof Cambridge. Thus it can be said that he derived the rawmaterial of his theory from oriental literature. strikeout is my personal opinion that might be pushing it!edit reading away even Rumi discussed evolution? cool... On P the paper states there was some Greek discussion on the topic but I havent yet found any references to Greek writers. Im curious to know how far the Greeks got with the idea. My grandfather says its also somewhat derived from Hindu ideas of reincarnation which makes a lot of sense.The more I look at it the more it looks like the Greeks didnt have evolution just classifications arranged progressively. Looks to me like alJahiz connected the dots and argued for the transmutation of species.Its kinda weird to me that even progressive modern scholars e.g. Sh.

Quran gt Indeed Allah does not forgive association with Him but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.  the sin of practicing idolatry or polytheism i.e. the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than the singular God i.e. Allah. Literally it means the establishment of partners placed beside God. It is the vice that is opposed to the virtue of Tawhid monotheism.Within Islam shirk is an unforgivable crime if it remains unpardoned before death God may forgive any sin if one dies in that state except for committing shirk.The deification of Jesus AS is a form of major shirk.

Quran There is certainly no unity in having numerous sects that each deem their be the truth while there is only one saved sect  which is those who follow the Quran and Sunnah upon the understanding of the Salaf. Allaahs Messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam drew a line with his hand and said This is the straight path of Allaah.

But there are also Christians who undoubtedly believed that christianizing nonchristian peoples is a divine prescription for ensuring their passage to heaven.Of course  and their views are perfectly internally coherent they would not be hypocritical to love Christian imperialism while hating Islamic imperialism since they believe their own ideology to have some semblance of exceptional validity.gt From the outside Im thinking how is it possible to determine which point of deserves more validity? Or perhaps theres simply no such way to do so and were thus forever mired in a state of discursive subjectivity.Well this is where its all up to you. A postmodern existentialist especially in the stubbornly nihilistic framework of the modern world where all morality is widely perceived to be relative would probably venture that determining which point of view is more valid is impossible. But a moral realist would be more inclined to believe that there is probably one view that is in fact more valid.It ultimately comes down to whether the logic of each paradigm persuades you or not. Islam persuades me so I accept its paradigm and allow it to color my worldview whereas a Christian does the same for hisher own creed.Like the first word Allahswt revealed to Muhammadpbuh read.

It isnt me all alone forcing an changes on the word. Its become more common. So now we come to the discussion who really decides what a word means. Is it isnt historical context Is it how popular culture uses it. Is it the changes in popular culture. Is it one single entity?.What we are seeing is a change in the worlds intelligence and recognizing that Arabs are also Semites hence more and more people discuss the historical understanding compared to the linguistic understand and how culture is moving towards understanding antisemitism as inclusive of Arabs hate as well.

However Ismail was strongly antiSunni ignored the Sultans warning and continued to spread the Shia faith by the sword.gtHe persecuted imprisoned and executed stubbornly resistant Sunnis.gtWith the establishment of Safavid rule there was a very raucous and colourful almost carnivallike holiday on  Dhu alHijjah or alternatively  Rabi alawwal celebrating the murder of Caliph Umar.

However as relations between Iran and Sunni countries improved the holiday was no longer observed at least officially.gtIn  Ismail invited all the Shia living outside Iran to come to Iran and be assured of protection from the Sunni majority.Which ties in with the Ottomans attempting to control Safavid agents in Eastern Anatolia namely the followers of some heterodox Bektashi orders. In the historical context of this the Ottomans did not persecute anyone at all and were immensely benevolent in their treatment of the Bektashi Alevis especially considering what Ismail the goon was doing in Persia.And that is how Persia was converted from Sunnah to first Ismails heterodox Shiism to then a mix of the heterodox Shiism with Jaafari IthnaAsharah Shiism. ,islam,crj1pfd,1,t5_2qhbp

They showed how in the same mosque you have people of different madhabs praying together some put their hands on their chest others lay them down others say Ameen vocally after the Fatiha others make salam only once at the end of the prayer etc. All within the same mosque.They also interviewed an Iraqi guy who was talking about how things were in Iraq before the US invasion how in the same household you would have both Sunnis and Shia even siblings.

But on the day of Judgement do you want to have it written that You were the one championing it?gt Nobody is going to force Imams to preside of samesex NikkahsPerhaps you havent been closely following the news. Its against the law in a secular country to discriminate based on gender sexual orientation ethnicity social status etc even though these things happen regularly but at least arent supposed to happen legally... and if proven in a court of law can cause issues for organizations. Once fully ratified if a gay couple comes to an imam requesting their union be officiated and the imam refuses solely on the premise of their sexual orientation what exactly do you call that? What happens to the imam then? What happens to the organization? If you think this is far fetched there already exists movements against various Muslim establishmentsnot just masaajidgoing after them legally for the sole purpose of them attempting to enact equal gender segregation. Want a more concrete example? Google minister in trouble for refusing gay marriage. There are already people working hard to legally enforce the right for gay couples to get married which means those who refuse to marry them based on their homosexuality are doing something illegal. Check your faces bro. gt Thats just my reasoning as a Muslim but also as someone who knows several LGBT people in very loving monogamous relationships.Not going out on gay bashing. We live in a secular pseudo democracy not a truthful shariah abiding Islamic nation. Gay people will do whatever they want as facilitated by the laws here and nongays and  or religious individuals will do the same... again within the boundaries of the law.

4452860,0,t3_3c36zu,Waalaikum salaam. gtI know that its dangerous to mix culture with IslamI want to point out that many Eastern cultures managed to organically integrate with Islam. In fact Islam do not forbid cultural norms unless it is against Islamic principle.Freedom of speech however is one of the main cultural values that the West treasures is a contentious issue that many Muslims today has troubles with. Generally speaking Islam recognises the inherent dangers of speech and restricts some speeches.Freedom of speech and satires for example those espoused by South Park run against Islamic principles and values. Islam does not condone mocking of others even if in jest or against Islamic beliefs. Please note that no Muslims will mock the biblical prophets because we believe that they are Muslims but observe how no Muslims mock Hinduism or Buddhism. In another example freedom of speech would protect hate groups like KKK and Islam is against this kind of speech because Islam believes that all man is created equal and we have different races to get to know each other better.So say in example of Charlie Hebdo. Islam sees no value in it at all. Being free to mock others simply because of freedom to mock others? There is no value in that. In fact Charlie Hebdo is a hypocritical publication when that same publication censors itself of any criticism against the Israel regime while championing freedom of speech by mocking Islam.Most champions of freedom of speech are hypocritical in reality. Freedom of speech in actuality is an illusion. In any scenario you will find the limits of freedom of speech. Like in Charlie Hebdo it limits the freedom of speech from criticising Israel.Ultimately the issue lies with how Islam views freedom itself. Islam arose in a culture where slavery was common and in fact deeply understand the true nature of freedom. No human is actually free but they are servants of Allah. One can only find true freedom by being subservient of Allah. edit Seeing that today is the th of July lets further our talks of freedom and liberty by looking back at history. Those men who wrote the declaration that says that all men are created equal yet they themselves are slaveholders. They seeked liberty from their colonial masters when they themselves are masters of slaves.,islam,csrytr1,3,t5_2qhbp

Lets not get confused now. Our society completely rejects sex and marriage with a prepubescent and an adult person. But the thing is  years ago was nothing like today. Children at that time period were forced to mature and grow up. Average lifespan was obviously very short. Under these circumstances its OK to havesexwithmarry a person that just hit puberty even though one of the partners is of old age. Also another thing to take note people followed Muhammad pbuh even after knowing about his marriages. Thus my point is nobody cared and not because they dont have a heart but because it was normal. For the that time period once a person learned how to walk they would walk. Once they learned how to pick they would pick Once they learned how to work they would work immediately. There was no teen phase. It was pretty much one day youre a kid and the next youre an adult. The Prophet lived until his s. That is really old for someone that lived before the Dark Ages.

4592312,0,t1_ct9g6uf,So obviously Jews dont see Muhammad pbuh as having brought about teachings which replace Judaism. Mainstream thought does not see him as a divine prophet but that Islam is a part of Gods plan for the world still. It has as of now a billion people who have been brought into the fold of Monotheism. Without Islam and so without Muhammad pbuh these people would likely be Christians which is not considered perfect monotheism by Jews like Islam is or would be paganistic as they had been before. TLDR hes not a prophet but his actions are part of Gods plan to bring all of mankind into monotheistic thought. Islam is seen by mainstream Orthodoxy as Perfect Monotheism meaning the understanding of Monotheism is unblemished by things like deification as you see in Christianity. My question to you is what do Muslims believe about Judaism?

Its time to ask yourself if it really is her age that you fear or rather the fact that you may feel threatened by a woman who has achieved great things in life and is your intellectual equal.Or perhaps its neither and marriage simply isnt for you.Again way to shame men again for not wanting to marry women who they are not interested in.

4644411,0,t1_ctfyn5f,I think the fact that renting my whole life takes away my ability to provide for my family by robbing me of hundreds of thousands of dollars means that taking such a rigid view on riba is foolish. The whole point of outlawing riba is to prevent poor people from being taken advantage of by loan sharks and being put in a worse financial situation simply because they are poor ending up digging themselves into a deeper and deeper financial hole.By renting your whole life while being a person of modest means ends up with you never being able to get out of poverty. You will always live check to check because you cant save money when youre giving it all away to the landlord. Instead of making payments on a house that one day will be yours paid in full an asset that provides you real wealth in the form of a dwelling that cant be taken away from you you over pay to someone who owns the house effectively throwing away your wealth month after month. You then cant afford to provide your children with things they need to be happy like paying for a good education or buying more expensive but healthier foods and even the occasional spending on a toy or gift. This to me is the greater haram.

Lets say apostasy does not equal death. Is stoning the adulterer in public now haram too? Because its medieval and savage? Or is that not part of Islam as well? Come on akhi! Fear Allah SWTgt Various scholars have spoken against death for apostasy include Ibn Taymiyyah Ali Gomaa Hamza Yusef Tariq Ramadan Mahmud Shaltut and many more.I have never been so speechless in my life. Firstly ibn Taymiyyah RH believes apostasy  death and he is the one who fought the apostate TatarsREADibn Taymiyyahs AsSarim alMaslool ala Shatim arRasool                                                                                                                       ... Apostasy is of two types ordinary apostasy and extreme apostasy for which execution is prescribed. In both cases there is evidence that it is obligatory to execute the apostate but the evidence indicating that the sentence of death may be waived if the person repents does not apply to both types of apostasy. Instead the evidence indicates that that is allowed only in the first case ordinary apostasy as will be clear to anyone who studies the evidence that speaks about accepting the repentance of the apostate. In the second type extreme apostasy the obligation to put the apostate to death still stands and there is no text nor consensus to indicate that the death sentence may be waived. The two cases are quite different and there is no comparison between them. It does not say in the Quran or Sunna or according to scholarly consensus that everyone who apostatizes in word or deed may be spared the death sentence if he repents after he is a captured and tried. Rather the Quran and Sunna and consensus differentiate between the different kinds of apostates.Secondly to put him in the category alongside the others you mentioned I dont even know what to say about that.I have to say no comment on rislam has made me so speechless in my entire life than this one of yours.,islam,ctjyy57,1,t5_2qhbp

4722391,0,t1_ctppux0,Here are the actual hadiths. The ones you have mentioned are from antiislamic websites and are manipulated. There is no mention of Muhammad did not admonish her husband or ordered her to return to him and submit to his sexual desires and in the second hadith there is no beating the sentence they manipulate is a very small part of the actual hadith and as others have already mentioned there are other hadith from Aisha in which she clearly says that the Prophet never hit her. Bukhari Arabic                         .                              .                 .                .                  .                         .         .  .               .English Rifaa divorced his wife whereupon AbdurRahman bin AzZubair AlQurazi married her. Aisha said that the lady came wearing a green veil and complained to her Aisha of her husband and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating. It was the habit of ladies to support each other so when Allahs Messenger  came Aisha said I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes! When AbdurRahman heard that his wife had gone to the Prophet he came with his two sons from another wife. She said By Allah! I have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this holding and showing the fringe of her garment AbdurRahman said By Allah O Allahs Messenger ! She has told a lie! I am very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifaa. Allahs Messenger  said to her If that is your intention then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifaa unless AbdurRahman has had sexual intercourse with you. Then the Prophet  saw two boys with Abdur Rahman and asked him Are these your sons? On that AbdurRahman said Yes. The Prophet  said You claim what you claim i.e.. that he is impotent? But by Allah these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crowMuslim Arabic                                       .   .                                                 .              .   .                                                                                               .     .         .         .          .   .                .        .                                          .

Qais then reported that it was Aisha who had narrated this Should I not narrate to you about myself and about the Messenger of Allah ? We said Yes. She said When it was my turn for Allahs Messenger  to spend the night with me he turned his side put on his mantle and took off his shoes and placed them near his feet and spread the corner of his shawl on his bed and then lay down till he thought that I had gone to sleep. He took hold of his mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly and opened the door and went out and then closed it lightly. I covered my head put on my veil and tightened my waist wrapper and then went out following his steps till he reached Baqi. He stood there and he stood for a long time. He then lifted his hands three times and then returned and I also returned. He hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I too ran. He came to the house and I also came to the house. I however preceded him and I entered the house and as I lay down in the bed he the Holy Prophet entered the house and said Why is it O Aisha that you are out of breath? I said There is nothing. He said Tell me or the Subtle and the Aware would inform me. I said Messenger of Allah may my father and mother be ransom for you and then I told him the whole story. He said Was it the darkness of your shadow that I saw in front of me? I said Yes. He gave me a nudge on the chest which I felt and then said Did you think that Allah and His Apostle would deal unjustly with you? She said Whatsoever the people conceal Allah will know it. He said Gabriel came to me when you saw me. He called me and he concealed it from you. I responded to his call but I too concealed it from you for he did not come to you as you were not fully dressed. I thought that you had gone to sleep and I did not like to awaken you fearing that you may be frightened. He Gabriel said Your Lord has commanded you to go to the inhabitants of Baqi to those lying in the graves and beg pardon for them. I said Messenger of Allah how should I pray for them How should I beg forgiveness for them? He said Say Peace be upon the inhabitants of this city graveyard from among the Believers and the Muslims and may Allah have mercy on those who have gone ahead of us and those who come later on and we shall God willing join you.,islam,ctpsott,3,t5_2qhbp

4725502,0,t1_ctq59gt,gt There were prophecies from the old testament about Jesus. They were quite detailed and they were fulfilledThats fine.  Muslims can claim the same.  gt Can you explain this more please?Sure.  The Quran was revealed and recited by Muhammad SAW to his companions verse by verse over  years.  There was no whole book revealed.  It was an oral revelation.  This did not mean scribes werent present which Muhammad SAW had many of but the primary mode of transmission especially in the formative years was oral.  Thousands upon thousands of Muslims were called to memorize the Quran and they did.  In fact it was based on the very fear of losing the memorizers of the Quran that it was eventually codified.Drawing from that base we have both written and oral transmission upon which the Quran now rests.  Every verse was attested to through written material and since the Quran was and still is fully memorized by many the codification could be verified and was verified by whomever chose to do it.gt Quran As I said the Quran was revealed over  years.  Verses themselves were revealed for specific reasons and situations so the history is also relevant.  I dont have the time to quote a tafsir exegesis for you but I know there were nonMuslim tribes with which Muhammad SAW did not conquer since they had treaties and many instances about the jizya being rescinded as Omar RA did because of an old jewish man and returned as Abu Ubaidullah ibn Jarrah RA did in present day Syria because the Muslims said they could not defend them.  ,islam,ctq6u09,6,t5_2qhbp

None of the Sunnis here will slander the Prophet so what is the purpose in your posts other than hurting feelings or hardening Sunni attitudes against shia?Instead of railing against Twelver Shia on this forum and running the risk of creating fitnah and slandering good practicing Muslims you may benefit from taking a more loving attitude towards our Twelver brothers and sisters.

Afghan Mujahideen killed Soviet teachers killed civillian workers in newly built schools and power stations they killed people who supported the PDPA or the soviets they executed people civillians who were pro socialist. Were the mujahideen terrorists? Because you cant say the PKK is without saying the other is.  The PKK have no history of targeting civillians they have always gone after military targets. This is why the UN never declared them terrorist despite many states doing so because they were not targeting civillians.The difference obviously being this Imam was killed during a raid but wasnt targetted. He was a casualty of war. Same can not be said of the Mujahideens victims such as the female teachers from the SU who were raped and beheaded for teaching children to read. So again mass support for the Mujahideen despite them beheading people as well as legitimately resisting invasion.

4870771,1,t3_3hlwdd,The Islamic state was very communal in nature at first and welfarewealth distribution was a key feature of the system. Taxes were low but strictly enforced and people in the government were not supposed to be rich. Some narrations that I heard indicated that the Prophet and also Imam Ali were poor while they governed or lived extremely modestly.The first caliph to face accusations of corruption was Uthman. He was criticized for putting family members into government positions and also taking too much money from the treasury. Some people deny that the accusations were legitimate but they were enough to upset Abu Dharr who they say was banished for protesting corruption.The early Islamic system relied a lot on the discretion of individuals in power. It was not a fully democratic system but there were key elements to the system. Caliphs subjected themselves to the rule of law and there are famous narrations of caliphs like Umar and Ali taking Muslims to court and having the judge rule against them.Overall its hard to say that the system was very stable. Three of the four first caliphs were assassinated and they were considered by most Muslims to be the truly worthy ones. Caliphs five and six were so infamous for their corruption and mismanagement that the Muslims revolted.Ruling class corruption a consistent problem in Islamic history and its still a problem today.Edit Since I got several replies saying the same thing I thought Id address them here instead of replying to each one individually. My comment about the fifth and sixth caliphs were regarding Muawiya and Yazid. If you believe Hasan ibn Ali was the fifth caliph then the numbers will be different.A bunch of you went into full propaganda mode trying to explain away why Abu Dharr accused Uthman of corruption saying who was right etc. My comment was not about whether accusations against Uthman were true or deserved I am just pointing out to my knowledge it was the earliest point in Islamic history in which a leader has been accused of financial corruption.,islam,cu8hxq8,2,t5_2qhbp

4905742,0,t1_cucv3bw,Let me clarifyAs you know Google trends compares relative popularity not total search volume. So if country A has higher rating than country B on a specific term then that just means country A has a higher percentage of people searching for that term on Google.  If Country B has blocked all pornography websites then it makes sense that Country B will have a much higher percentage of people searching for pornography terms on Google than Country A because they can skip Google.But then this still isnt enough. The country that comes out on top on Google trends also depends on what sex term you are searching for.  I remember an older article talking about how popular gay pornography is in a Muslim country but that article was gravely misleading. They were using very specific obscure search terms on Google trends where the country came out on top and ignored more common pornography terms and used that to justify their research.  Someone with bias can easily justify their position this way.  You can try this yourself on Google trends and search for different terms to see which countries come out on top.Then there are other factors to consider like what about other search sites like Bing? Bing is used in some countries more than others so of course that will have an effect. I would normally think that the best way to do this type of study would be to check the the viewership of the largest pornography sites but then this too is problematic because those sites can be blocked in some countries.,islam,cucwm8t,11,t5_2qhbp

However it is possible that a believer be admitted to Hell is that what youre suggesting? depending on their strength of faith and depending on the severity of the sin. For example if a strongwilled Muslim hypothetically were to commit a major sin e.g. kill commit adultery fornication etc then if they dont repent both physically there are rules that you have to do to ensure your repentance and emotionally then they would have to serve in Hell for the amount of sins theyve committed.

4962691,0,t3_3iutm9,Of course Imaam ashShaafiis words could be wrong as what he says is not above the seven heavens. He is merely human and made laws and fundamental principles like the Ijtihaad principles you linked above based on his knowledge of revelation. As he is one of our greatest scholars given to us by Allaah we use the Quraan and Sunnah to determine if what he says is correct. As Imaam Maalik said about himselfgt I am only a human being. I err sometimes and I am correct sometimes. So look into my opinion. So everything that agrees with the Book and the Sunnah then take it. And everything that does not agree with the Book and the Sunnah then leave it off.  Imaam MaalikAnd Imaam Ahmad said about the other founders of the Madhhabsgt As for the opinions of alAwzaaee Maalik and Abee Haneefah then all of that is merely opinion. The evidence is only found in the Aathaar.  Imaam AhmadAnd the Mudhaahibs have had great exposure to the Quraan and the Sunnah as they were part one of the greatest of generations though they were not exposed to all of the Ahaadeeth as Imaam ashShaafii saidgt There isnt any of us who hasnt had a saying or action of Allaahs Messenger sallallaahu alayhi wasallam elude him or slip his mind. So no matter what rulings I have made or fundamental principles I have established there will be in them things contrary to the way of Allaahs Messenger sallallaahu alayhi wasallam. However the correct ruling is according to what the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu alayhi wasallam said and this is my true ruling.  Imaam AshShaafiiAs people on this subreddit do not have great knowledge of the Quraan and Sunnah there are others who do have great knowledge of the Quraan and Sunnah including the knowledge mentioned in the linked post to the point that they can make Fatwas and Tafseer and even refute scholars where they erred if it wasnt for the rules of this subreddit. As Umar ibn alKhattaab said about when two Sahaabas differedgt Umar ibn alKhattaab the second Righteous Caliph got angry because of a dispute between the Sahaabee Ubayy ibn Kab and another Sahaabee Ibn Masood over the performance of Salaah in a single piece of cloth. Ubayy considered it quite all right while Ibn Masood felt that was so only when cloth was scarce. Umar angrily left his residence and declared Have two of Allaahs messengers companions disagreed and they are amongst those whom the masses watch closely and imitate? Ubayy is correct and Ibn Masood should desist! If I hear of anyone disputing about this matter after this point I will deal with him.  Umaar ibn alKhattaab as told by AlMuzaanee the student of Imaam ashShaafii.And Allaah says in Soorat anNisaa about differinggt                   gt And if you disagree over anything refer it to Allah and the Messenger if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best way and best in result.  Soorat anNisaa And the messenger of Allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam said about differinggt                         gt Leave me with what I have left to you for those who were before you were destroyed because of excessive questioning and their differencing Ikhtilaaf to their apostles. So when I command you to do anything do it as much as it lies in your power and when I forbid you to do anything then abandon it.  Saheeh MuslimSo the fundamental source for the Mujtahid is to go back to the Allaah and His messenger sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam. And this overrides what the Madhdhaahibs have ruled or established from their Ijtihaad. So when two scholars rule contradicting rulings such Imaam AshShaafii as well as most of his students ruled that any touch of the women invalidates Woodoo while Imaam Abu Haneefah ruled that even if a man touches the entire skin and body of the women his Woodoo is invalid still valid typo Reference Bilal Philips The Evolution of Fiqh page  then the difference has to be taken back to the word of Allaah and his messenger sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam to solve this dilemma as Allaah stated in Soorat anNisaa referenced above.And Allaah knows best.,islam,cuk33y2,2,t5_2qhbp

And if Im wrong I hope someone will correct me InshaAllah.gt  How does Islam view homosexuality?Homosexuality is very much frowned upon in Islam to be frank. While nothing could change the homosexuals position or thoughts and attractions in Islam homosexual acts should be repressed. As Jonathon Brown a famous scholar suggests homosexual acts are viewed similar to adultery both are major sins and if you do not repent both physically and genuinely after committing these sins you will be punished in the afterlife  even if you are the most humble Muslim. Islam places much emphasize on the traditional family wife and kids. This being a sin is not surprising at all to be honest.gt  In what ways do terrorists violate the laws of Islam why is their interpretation of it incorrect?Well theyre violating many things to be frank. Just a glance at this  link to see for yourself. They are not just. There are so many things that they are doing wrong including killing innocent civilians. The fact that they are wrong is emphasized in this verse of the Qurangt Because of that We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption done in the land  it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one  it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them even after that throughout the land were transgressors.gt  Is ISIS the Black Horsemen a group mentioned in the Quran?No.gt  What is a Hadith?A hadith is the oral transmission of the Prophets pbuh sayings. gt  What are the various forms of jihad? What is jihad of the sword?In Arabic jihad generally means a struggle. Jihad in terms of war is only a recent thing that developed as a result of political tension. gt  How many Muslims support the actions of religious extremists what percent?Extremists are a minority. And as they violated many of Islams teachings not many Muslims support them. I cant give you a percentage sorry.gt  Was Muhammad truly peaceful?Well I might be biased but yes. Had he been a warmonger would Islam really have spread as far into Indonesia? If you would like proof here  and here  and here  In Islam the Prophet pbuh is a man and a human. He makes mistakes. He forgives and worries. He jokes and cries. He sleeps and is just. But he is human.gt  The word Allah translates to God in English. Is Allah the God of the Bible and Torah?Yes Allah translates to God in English. Technically He is the God of the Bible and the Torah but Muslims believe that these two texts had been corrupted. Also Allah in Islam is strictly one God not Father Son and Holy Spirit. There are notable difference specifically in traits between the God of the Bible and the Quran. While Allah swt is forgiving in the Quran He is also severe in punishment. Hope that helped.,islam,cus68hy,4,t5_2qhbp

5118648,0,t3_3l2qw6,Well youd have to first have a sense of who and what God swt is before you take into consideration revelation. Lets say we can accept the universe is created by God swt but make no further assumptions about Him. So lets pose the question From observing the world what can you deduce about God swt?. Given that He is God swt and created the universe that means He existed well enough before there was a universe and has no need for it. This suggests He is free from need.. Given the incredible vastness of the universe and all the knowledge within its making suggests that whoever created it has near infinite if not infinite knowledge.. The incredible balance in the laws of nature everything from physics to chemistry to biology and suggest that He is an entity that likes order and balance. Balance in almost everything we observe. . The bounty that nature offers us from food and shelter the brains we have to come up with solutions the beautiful things in this world given to us despite no obligation on Gods swt part suggest that he is generous and has some affection for us.. Difficulty exists in this world. Why would a just God swt who has some affectiongenerosity towards us who is free from need withhold certain blessings and allow difficulty to come upon us? Well look at a child growing up the one who grows up rich as can be everything handed to them never had to face any hardships would not grow up with a strong character. So difficulty really makes us stronger try harder.. We have free will. This brings us back to the idea of balance how is balance maintained when not everyone has a similar amount of joy and difficulty in this life. When some commit evil and get away from the law and others fall victim to it. If this life was all there is to it then perhaps God does not like balance in all things? But why would a God who has put balance in every single thing besides humans make an exception? There must be something the will balance the equation if not in ones current life then somewhere else.. If the equation is to be balanced well then an accurate accounting must be done. A judgement if you will. But how can a judge pass judgement without laws in place? The party being judged needs to be judged based on some law. . Which brings us to revelation. Not all humans have the mental power to deduce certain truths. If we can deduce the existence of God it doesnt mean we can deduce what the laws that would impart balance would be. So a God who clearly wants balance in all things and who must pass judgement on humans to maintain that balance must at least inform humans of how they can balance their lives so they come out on the right side of judgement. To no do so would be unfair and in itself would be an imbalance in justice.. If we are asked through revelation to do certain acts to worship to give charity to forbid ourselves certain things these must serve the purpose to ensuring balance and justice i.e. ultimately its for our own good.You could ask the question what makes Gods characteristics justice balance affection generosity etc. good that we have to be subservient to them. Well the answer to that is a simple He created us and He does know better than us. Sure youve been given the ability to go against His wishes and cause imbalance... for a while. The question is why would you knowingly do something that would cause harm knowing that what ever domino effect of harm you caused will be balanced out against you in the end?This isnt a completely tight knit argument but I think if you want a line of reasoning to suggest why we can trust the revelation from Allah swt and trust Allah swt it would have to be something like this.,islam,cv2zlzq,6,t5_2qhbp

5137253,0,t1_cv4xpaf,not everyone subscribes to kosherhalal.At the outset it is important to understand that kosher foods do not necessarily meet the requirements of halal. It will not suffice for you to regard food items as halal by searching for nonkosher or nonharam ingredients.For more information with regards to kosher foods kindly refer to the following link Determining whether a particular food item is halal or haram is quite challenging due to the various ingredients found in our food industry. To ensure that one is consuming halal food items at all times one must understand the content of the ingredients found in the products. It is best to contact the manufacturer and enquire about the ingredients from them. One should also contact a halal certifying organization who will advise whether the product is halal or haram.It is true that the zabihah slaughtered animal of the Ahl ulKitab Christians and Jews is halal as mentioned in the Quran. Allah Tala says     ...  And the food of the people of the Book is lawful for you Surah Maidah It is important to note that the Ahl ulKitab referred to must be Christians and Jews adhering to their beliefs and not just Christians and Jews by name. It is not sufficient for one to just be called a Jew or a Christian in order to be considered amongst the people of the book.It is also important to note that animals slaughtered by the Ahl ulKitab being halal is not general but is subject to the following conditions as the animals slaughtered by Muslims Taking the name of Allah upon slaughtering the animal At least three of the four vessels being severedMajority of present day Christians are known to either have no dietary laws at all in regards to animal slaughtering or their dietary laws state that it is necessary to say the name of the Father the son and the Holy Ghost whilst slaughtering the animal. Furthermore they employ nonChristians to carry out the slaughter resulting in the slaughter of an animal by a nonAhl ulKitab.The slaughtering method of Jews does not meet the requirements of Sharah. For instance during a shechita ritual slaughtering of the Jews the shochet Jewish ritual slaughterer recites the blessing of God only on the first animal holding it to suffice for all animals slaughtered afterwards. This method renders all animals aside from the first animal haram. Furthermore due to the different ethnic cultures and branches within Juadism different kosher certifying authorities adopt different rules to certify what is considered to be kosher.Alhhamdulillah Muslims residing in the West have made lots of efforts to establish halal zabhah and slaughter animals according to Sharah laws of Zabhah. Therefore halal meat is easily available. The above was taken from askimam.org. Alims certified Islamic scholars respond to the questions posted and the answers are verified by Mufti Desai.

5165952,0,t1_cv8o7di,gtWhat Im saying is those Muslims who are so proud of committing zina and then when they finish having their fun years later decide they did mistakes and repent.I agree its unfortunate because it happens a lot that a guy will mess around for years and then look for a virgin wife. She will have saved herself for the one so theres an imbalance. Def messed up.But there is another issue we dont realize sometimes. Some people dont know or understand why dating or having zina is wrong. We see it happen especially in the U.S. I for example understood more or less sex outside of marriage was haraam. But I could never understand why simply being in a relationship Ive never actually been in one of those but always wanted it with someone even with the intent of marriage was wrong. And my parents didnt explain it to me that well either. The masjid was useless because if you even mentioned that you sat next to a girl in class because of assigned seating the teachers would immediately say astaghfirullah. I get they were seeking forgiveness for themselves and those in such a situation but when they leave the discussion at that and not actually teach others how to navigate these instances many people stop caring about their deen. Ive seen this kind of stuff happen plenty. Some people legitimately dont know why zina is haraam or why even relationships outside of marriage are more or less wrong. When I started watching YouTube videos like Nouman Ali Khan and Omar Suleiman then I finally started to understand and that actually brought me back into the deen Alhamdulillah.Imagine how much more serious it is for a person who actually committed the act because no one gave an actual reason why its wrong. If you tell someone about STDs or pregnancy they can easily bring up the fact there are forms of contraceptive which as far as I know are halaal except for permanent ones that provide protection.With that said we definitely still need to be careful if we have reason to believe someone committed such acts what counts as reason is for the scholars to decide.Another issue is perhaps someone who was young and foolish acted without realizing what heshe was doing and afterwards became addicted. Addiction is a serious issue and we need to understand that addiction doesnt necessarily make a person bad especially if they try and fight it. Like I said all good is from Allah SWT and all bad is misguidance. And He Knows Besttldr some people are scum but many truly didnt know any better,islam,cv8oshj,1,t5_2qhbp

5270955,0,t3_3n70po,The differences in the schools of thought happen due to their principles of fiqh. They have different methods in arriving to a conclusion. For example the Hanafi scholars focused a lot on analogies whilst the Maliki scholars gave more preference to the practices of the people of Madinah. Thus each school has a certain methodology and stays consistent with that methodology to reach judgments. As far as disagreeing with certain rulings goes you must understand that a school of thought is not the opinion of just the one scholar. Hanafiism is not just the rulings and judgment of Imam Abu Hanifah rather there were dozens of scholars and students using his method of jurisprudence reaching judgments and rulings. So you have dozens and dozens of scholars who dedicate their lives to the task and finally give their rulings based on these principles. Now because these rulings are passed through a valid and agreed upon system of jurisprudence the whole concept of desire is thrown out. One doesnt have to worry that his desire is getting in the way of his Deen. However when one goes astray from the majority opinion in that school of thought one must make sure that the reason for doing so is based on a valid set of principles and methodology and not simply out of the desire of ones heart. No doubt scholars within the same school of thought have differences ALL the time yet they have enough knowledge about the Usool ul Fiqh Principles of Jurisprudence and the Quran and Ahadith itself to be sure that their differences are still valid outside the scope of desire. Cherry picking would probably not be allowed at all since its a matter of what you like and dont like personally and this goes against the Quran. ,islam,cvlf9nn,6,t5_2qhbp

5286127,0,t3_3n8qv0,This is a very interesting topic. Some facts. No amount of wrongdoing can overcome Allahs forgiveness.. Satan has free will just as we do.. Satan was already told to enter the Hellfire but asked for this sentence to be delayed until the Day of Resurrection.. The doors to repentance close before the coming of the hour.Ill try to be as brief as possible cause no matter what Satan is an open enemy to us and its better to think about other things.Sata Adam amp Eve were all sentenced to Hell. Adam amp Eve repented and were put on Earth. Satan instead asked for his sentence to be delayed so he could show that humans are worse than him and misguide as many of us as possible. Allah granted Satan this. If Satan has genuinely apologies surely he would have been forgiven. It seems Satan failed his test when he refused to bow down and then sealed his fate by asking for respite rather than forgiveness. Satan has free will though so really he could repent whenever but maybe his doors to repentance are closed? Who knows...For us the doors to repentance close when the major signs begin to unfold. I dont think this is the same cutoff point for Satan  it cant be this world isnt a test for Satan hes in a very very different position to us. There could be so much we dont know though. And from what we do know perhaps Allah planned for Satan to follow the path he did and willed for him to be an open enemy to us so we will be tested thoroughly and perhaps Allah wasnt actually going to send Satan to Hell in the first place but again whos to know and whos to say?,islam,cvnd53o,1,t5_2qhbp

5313431,0,t3_3nsa5u,Well there are lots of things but one very significant aspect is the concept of rights. Islamic rights differs from legal rights in the sense that they are not simply limited to what a person inherently deserves but what human beings deserve in regards to their relation with other things. There are rights of your parents rights of children rights of neighbor rights of your relatives rights of the elderly that you take care of them and respect them rights of your guest that you shelter and provide for them rights of animals and other creation rights of the body that has been temporarily been given to you rights of your fellow Muslim the rights of Allah example that as your creator He be worshiped and on and on and on.This concept is very much associated with the fact that Islam is not merely a belief but in essence a way of life a lifestyle. It is very common for people to be conflicted on whether to do a certain act of not whether that be for moral cultural or personal reasons. Islam in general makes it very clear how exactly you need to live and interact with others. Youll find that even if you are not a Muslim the way Islam describes how one should interact and that in general Islamic virtues such as taking care of the elderly or feeding the poor or helping the orphans are all things that are viewed as pious and noble.Keep in mind that Islam is a guide not merely outlines and describing a practical approach to the complexity of human interaction is among one of the many reasons Muslims choose to practice this faith everyday.,islam,cvquq5n,8,t5_2qhbp

5339878,0,t1_cvu5goc,gt That was just an example.A false assumption. A false example. gt So He willed certain people to hell? Humans have free will. They have free will to make any decision they desire including denouncing Allah. This is validated by the fact that there is both Heaven and Hell. If humans didnt have the free will to choose there would be little reason for a Heaven and Hell exist. According to the Quran the seven Heavens the Earth and everything in between was created in six ayam or length of time. Its possible that the Heavens were created solely for our purpose for our existence. Humans have morality the ability to decide the good and the bad and Heaven is created for the good while Hell is created for the bad. But of course there is a middle ground and exceptions but this is just the gist.As a result its wrong to say that Allah desired some of us to be put in Hell. Thats your decision. You made the wrong choices. Allah has given you guidance through thousands of Prophets the Quran the Bible the Torah. Allah willed our existence. But humans have free will. I would recommend reading some philosophy books to verify the existence of free will.   ,islam,cvu888f,1,t5_2qhbp

5353224,0,t3_3o8ktd,gtSo in secular freedom you pretty much do whatever you want and Im guessing would often end up doing what the system wants you to do.. Buy what you want wear what you want but necessarily think what you want..While in Islamic freedom youre bound by some like what clothes to wear but have intellectual freedom..Secular freedom usually respect the following principle  gtYou can do whatever you want with your own property as long as it does not affect somebody elses property. Keep in mind that here your own body is considered your property. This principle is more or less equivalent to a mutualist position in which a necessary and sufficient condition for the morality of an act is the mutual consent of all involved. In Islam as I understand it things are a little bit different. It is not sufficient in Islam for all party involved to consent. For instance drinking and gambling are forbidden and are so regardless of the fact that I may want to drink or that me and my friend may want to play a friendly game of poker. That we all consent to this is irrelevant as we must always take God into account. As for Islam granting its people freedom of thoughts Im not too sure what thats supposed to mean. If we are for instance to recognize that one must not covets someone elses wife then I would say that this is an injunction that goes against freedom of thoughts and thus intellectual freedom broadly conceived. I am not sure furthermore that in an Islamic society a person would be able to promote atheism for instance so that the intellectual freedom we speak of would be more or less moot. Whats the point of having and developing idea youre not allowed to express them? When reading the Islamic sources the notion of freedom does not intervene a lot. It does mean submission after all. ,islam,cvvxnvm,1,t5_2qhbp

However in this particular scene we are presented with the problem of the characters and the solutionproblem self hatredsolution recognition of human beauty.The painting on the wall is criticised by Paco as being a lie some worthless piece of bullshit that has no truth value in the real world. Cruz responds that that is not true that Pacos problem is that he believes himself to be wretched he believes his brothers to be corrupted it is all he can see. Cruz sees that the deeper inward reality is that there is beauty in man. That man isnt essentially bad that man is a beautiful creature in his essential nature. It is this recognition that allows cruz to move on from self hatred. Too often we see the world and other people as being corrupted. Whilst it is definitely true that people have their own individual issues which are often times grosse and wretched in nature. It would be wrongful for us to thus assume that they are wretched themselves  the prostitute on the street the drug abuser. But we have to transcend that sphere because it is a sphere that puts people down. People are not meant to be put down in such a sphere. All men have the ability to rise and what they become is essentially their true nature  beauty. God didnt intend to create filth when he created man. God created beauty which the angels were commanded to submit to. ,islam,cw9vc6j,2,t5_2qhbp

5480537,0,t3_3q4b0a,In tenth grade I was... looking for something.  I couldnt define it at the time.  But I was restless and anxious all the time.  One of the ways I tried to combat that was learning more about religion not with the intention of converting but initially just out of intellectual curiosity.  I read the Bible and other Christian and Jewish texts and they were interesting in terms of helping me learn about those religions and how they related to history.But when I read the Quran something just touched me in my soul or in my brain or just about everywhere in what makes me me.  It was beautiful and the message was beautiful and I started researching Islam in a big way.  There wasnt a huge miracle or anything just.... a sense of Oh this is what Ive been looking for in my life.I converted officially shahadah and all about seven months later.  Funnily what held me off was worry about praying.  Im a dwarf and kneeling is impossible for me at the time resources online didnt really speak to that and so I was sitting there thinking Oh no I cant convert because I cant pray right!Then one day I was reading... I want to say Time magazine Im not sure though and there was a picture of a man praying a Palestinian.  He was in a church that had been taken over at one point and more importantly he was praying but squatting instead of kneeling!  The caption noted that he had been injured at some point and was simply unable to kneel so this is how he prayed.It was kind of a lightbulb over the head duh moment for me.  Until then for whatever reason I hadnt connected the side of Islam thats so understanding about differences and accommodations to my own situation!  I look back on it now and laugh to be honest.  I let something that small keep me from converting!I did my first prayer that day.  And wudu using melted snow which I would not recommend if people have access to warm water because it is so cold.,islam,cwc6ujv,10,t5_2qhbp

In fact their slavemasters persecuted them even more for accepting Islam. So while their lives definitely became more difficult because they accepted Islam you cant say they were forced to boil in the water as their masters said that theyll be free from torture once they leave Islam yet the slaves didnt want to leave Islam no matter how hard their masters tried them to. They still chose to stay as Muslims.Just look at the story of the dark skinned Muslim whose name I forgot atm. And look at the story of all the other companions too.

Here is a post I made in response to another person on the thread to save myself time.The cables were mentioned in excerpts about hostilities toward Iran and Shia populations from a New York Times Article. That has nothing to do with the topic at hand because the article is not comparing its biased numbers with the Saudi Arabian Bureau of Statistics or anything.The numbers we have on the world Shia population come from established sources like The Pew Research Center.gtIn  Dr. Vali Nasr Dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington D.C. and a Senior Fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution published an article in Foreign Affairs magazine showcasing demographics for the worldwide Shia population that strongly differed from Pews research.Just take a look at this statement. The study of one Shia negates an established research group? Are you saying that the differing numbers is because this biased persons research is far more valid than an impartial organization?If a prominent Sunni Scholar and Sunni organization were to say that there are . billion Sunnis would you take those figures over impartial ones?This is no different and I hope even you can concede that. You and the article are willfully choosing the higher estimates from obscure sources to advance this baseless claim. Just look at this terrible commentarygtConsidering Indias staggering birth rate and the progression of that rate during nearly two decades the Alimaan Trusts analysis is likely to be closer to the truth.Again a Shia organizations estimates supersede a valid estimate because the author says so.gtThere are no Shia organizations quoted in the article.Im sorry but you gotta be kidding me. ,islam,cwitbyd,1,t5_2qhbp

The scholars you find these days will have read his work because that is how valuable it is and they will rearticulate what he has said. I personally hold him as one of the best but you wont ever hear me tell anyone how plagues and widespread death are about to occur because of society.People could easily say stuff back then that you could not imagine being said now. He was from a different age in a different society which is why the context is important when reading historic work. The arguments we use today would not have been usable back then and Ibn Qayyim didnt keep in mind or did not know how we would have addressed his audience in the st Century.The message in this post is only going to really affect those who know Ibn Qayyim.

Firstly Id advise him to look at the refutations of Isaiah  if you look at the context of the chapter you see that the Suffering Servant is mentioned in Isaiah a few times and it refers to Israel as a nation metaphorically and much of Isaiah is metaphorical. Also if we read the verses we seem to find things that dont seem to apply to the Biblical Jesus as here is an article  But most importantly the Bible talks about people dying for their own sins people being punished for their own sins so this message itself goes against the rest of the Torah.What do we have? This and more   So how do we know these were actually eyewitnesses? The Author of Mark for instance spoke greek but the eyewitnesses would of likely been peasants who spoke Aramaic. And we believe that the Prophet Jesus peace be upon him is the Messiah. We believe that the Prophet Jesus as was raised up by God Glory be to He and didnt die and we know that everyone has to die he returns however I dont know God knows best why did Moses peace be upon him take the Jews out of Egypt by Gods Will why wasnt it the Prophet Jesus as? Why is the Prophet Muhammad as the seal of the Prophets why not the Prophet Jesus as? It doesnt matter they are all servants of God The Most High and they were brothers.

Itll be good from a learning view point I think if you were to look into what God revealed before and what He revealed after. Might even help you understand the old testament better.May God help you on your journey and guide you on his straight path.,islam,cwqouap,2,t5_2qhbp

That angel is usually identified as Metatron. Newby notes thatgtgt...we can deduce that the inhabitants of Hijaz during Muhammads time knew portions at least of  Enoch in association with the Jews. The angels over which Metatron becomes chief are identified in the Enoch traditions as the sons of God the Bene Elohim the Watchers the fallen ones as the causer of the flood.

The madhahib are based on the four imams who were from Ahlus sunnah and the salaf so salafis do follow them. Your statement about its interpretations logically do not make sense. The salaf differed over certain things this is part of salafiyyah so if there are different opinions then the Salafi acknowledges that and understands that. Salafis follow the proof and the evidence.

5759545,1,t3_3u0skq,There is a great deal of misinformation floating around some conspiracy theories and some plainol double standards.Lets try to review this story. Ahmed Mohamed a kid starting his first month of high school brought his homemade clock project into school and shows his engineering teacher. His teacher tells him the clock is neat but that he shouldnt show it to anyone likely because it could be mistaken for something sinister. Later in the day during english class the clock begins beeping in his backpack and the teacher confiscates it under the rule that you cant have electronics disturbing the class. Hours later she thinks better of it and reports it to the office as a suspicious device and the school follows policy and calls the police. The police officer looks at it realizes it is not actually anything dangerous because the school isnt evacuated and no bomb squad called pulls Ahmed out of class and asks him about it. Its a clock Ahmed says confused at why the police are there. What is your name? the cop asks. Mohammed thats what I thought the cop says and decides to handcuff the kid.The officer clearly was acting racist and bigoted deciding that since the kid was Muslim clearly he was up to no good. The emails from the police department released under FOIA request show that the department admitted they screwed up because the officer on the scene called higherups for advice and they were unsure what to do. The kid did not try scaring anyone deliberately identified it correctly as a  clock when asked and there was no evidence of malicious intent. The higherups called higher ups asking what should be done. Eventually the officers on the scene arrested him with the famous photo you saw. The department lawyer admits this case will not go so well for them.Ahmeds father is a member of CAIR which is a civil rights group that fights discrimination against Muslims and hate crimes. Its like an NAACP or ADL for Muslims. After the brouhaha with the school the family decided to take him out of that high school and enroll him in private school where they felt he would be safer. Fortunately with all the press attention a private school specializing in science and engineering in Qatar offered him a scholarship and his family decided to accept it and move him out of Texas to a place with less islamophobia. His family is suing the school and police for profiling him based on race religion and national origin. His lawyer is asking for as much as  million but that is the opening bid in negotiations with the city.Unfortunately ever since the beginning these facts have been twisted into crazy theories that he didnt actually build a clock or have prior skills that he deliberately intended to create a bomb hoax at school and played dumb that his father set him up to do this stunt for publicity that this was all a scheme to get rich via a lawsuit that this was all part of a conspiracy plan to make Americans let their guard down about suspicious devices brought to schools that his family hates freedom and America and moved to a dictatorship because they prefer a lack of democracy etc. My God none of that is true and its been flooding rnews with a tsunami of falsehood. Im very disappointed at how Reddit is turning on this kid and I suspect its because hes Muslim at an inopportune time. Furthermore theres plenty of complaining about the high price of the lawsuit. If your child was arrested and pilloried by the media because of false statements by school and police wouldnt you want them punished? The school is still refusing to admit wrongdoing and wont apologize and the police officer threatened to arrest the dad for asking for the clock back at the station so the family has to turn to the courts in a lawsuit. When a black man is falsely arrested reddit posts flood the story saying he should get so many millions he should wind up owning the entire police station.Edward Said once said that people lose their common sense when talking about Muslims for some reason and this is a good example. White high schoolers in America bring actual weapons to school and arent punished as bad as Ahmed was. ,islam,cxb0xqg,2,t5_2qhbp

Simply being around nonMuslims impacts the way we perceive ourselves. Take for example Muslims attending public schools especially high school. Many Muslim students that attend public schools are surrounded by peers that influence them in many ways. Sometimes they are influenced by these peers so much that they get the feeling of just wanting to fit in. Many of these peers around the US are not Muslim thus sometimes the only way for a Muslim to fit in with their peers is to abide by the influence of their peers sacrificingmasking some of their Muslim identity to gain balance into western society. As a side note Muslim students can avoid the premarital sex drugs and alcohol that their peers are possibly engaged in all they want but that doesnt mean that Muslim students are not curiousI am happy for your wife her upbringing and how she has met someone like you. Many people dont have the strength to do what she does because I guess in my perspective she made it her goal to be balanced from the start. I can tell that she understands herself well and has the religious support of her family. Many others of the Muslim demographic are all over the place on the religious spectrum and we are all trying to find that happy medium. Thank you.,islam,cxtyl6g,5,t5_2qhbp

You have no excuse because you never checked the evidences.I can show you classical scholars who talk about the Sharia to be obeyed. But obviously Imam Abu Hanifa is not going to say dont obey man made laws when it is something so obvious. They lived in a time of Khilafah. they would never imagine Muslims to be in our situation.If you want to say obeying man made laws is halal fine. just provide a single ayat or hadith as evidence.

Your mind is what you consume. Nurture dominates nature for most people. Seeing violence makes you desentised to it. That does not mean you be become a soulless psychopath. But it does mean the empathy that you otherwise would have felt seeing suffering becomes less. So when you see military killing civilians you will not feel the indignation that people growing up in the s would have seeing the same things on the news. the counter arguemnt to this is so is everything else affecting you. Music movies friends youtube reddit culture etc. everything is affecting you and maybe we are overlooking the bigger contributors to your personality that are more dangerous. such as schools fashion etc. its good that you are taking steps to minimise the harmful effects of the gane environment.  none of us are perfect. but nonetheless as part of our religion we are on a journey of trying to perfect ourselves. so we must always be careful of distractions. the scholars like to mention the story of the slave sent to the market to buy something for his master. but he gets so distracted by all the attractions that the sunsets and time runs out. so you have to keep this in balance. everyone needs fun in their lives and leisure. but too much or the wrong type can be harmful. so be careful if you are going to that stage. i dont know if this is the wrong type or the wrong amount. and sometimes it depends on the person.  the addictive nature of gaming. most modern games are designed nowadays with addiction in mind. they are designed to make you addicted to it just like gambling or other similar distractions. there are many tricks to this. main one being the variable ratio schedule of reinforcement. games like candy crush world of war craft use leveling up as a means to keep players addicted. by just giving them a treat just as they are about to give up. to keep them coming for more. so like drug addicts we keep playing for that fix. they also use tactics that never allow you to feel satiated with the game. stopping you feeling like you have completed the game. they also use lights and lighting to make you enter into an adicts mindset. if you have ever noticed casinos slot machines use a lot of colour and strobe lighting. all studied and specifically designed to keep your brain hypnotised effectively. so when you win they give you a buzz with little rewards like fancy lightwork music fanfare points weapons etc. To give you a feeling of accomplishment. But not too much as then you wouldnt come back for more. i havent played counter strike so dont know what tactics they use. but given the billion dollar nature of the franchise i can guarantee they are using a lot of these reward systems to keep you addicted. and remember addictions and distractions are tricks designed to keep us sedentary and asleep from the real world. the romans had a phrase keep the mob occupied with bread and circuses and you can rule them. ,islam,cxwo3p6,1,t5_2qhbp

6022169,0,t1_cy8yjgl,gt My attributes of my speech my attribute of being an employee a kings attribute of being king arent separate from him nor do they exist independently of him. An attribute of a king does not exist separate from a king but the existence of attributes does imply that the king is separate from and contingent on the greater reality that defines him. In our case as finite beings or in the case of a king that greater reality is the Universe which contains everything needed for a king to exist people language social structure objects.... So the system which allows us to have attributes is also a system in which we are not one but constructed by many other things. A king can only be a king because there is the potential to be something else a nonking depending on how the building blocks within the system are structured and what entities they construct. This is a limitation it is what defines the meaning of an identity and hence attributes and is what makes us finite. A king has power in some social sense but that power cant be equivocated with power over existence itself over the attributes of a king and is thus as limited as his serfs on that level because of his identity alone even if he seems to have power over them on a social level.You could try to imagine the most perfect attributes and apply them to God as the most perfect being but then youre just using the mindset of our mortal finite existence to understand the greatest truth which the God concept is supposed to represent by projecting our ideas somewhere where they dont belong. Even the Quran says God is unlike anything in creation. A God upon whom attributes are forced for the sake of our connecting to the divine with religion is a God thats identified and hence limited by being put into a system where we are partners under the same system. A king and a serf may differ in the power over each other but the fact that we can talk about it says something about their lack of power a king cannot not have power over his serf by definition and that lack of power is what makes the system that they exist in Greater than them both. God is great and is what this system should be for us limited beings but religions polytheistic or monotheistic drag him down to our level through paradoxical theistic assertions instead of us trying to reach God by understanding the system of reality that constrains us the creation and thus does not constrain God.gtMy knowledge is not a separate person nor does it exist independently use common sense.An attribute like your knowledge is not a separate person from you but it doesnt have to be to make you a part of a greater system on which you are contingent upon. You can make yourself alone and the most powerful being in reality but youd still be a human with magic tricks limited by the reality that defines you. God is not supposed to be a human with magic tricks but the insistence on giving him attributes in many religions is what makes him seem like it. Saying that God cannot go against his nature isnt wrong per se but its wrong to then go talk about that nature. Above you said that the question is paradoxical when asked if God could limit himself but it wasnt. The insistence on defining God as having attributes by not allowing God to be ineffable infinite relative to us is what makes those paradoxes not the skeptical questions.God in a pantheon of gods in a polytheistic reality is not necessarily separate from that polytheistic divine reality. If a polytheist worships the gods that may merely mean that the power you call one God he calls the the gods. Anything you could say to diminish the potential truthfulness of polytheism can be said about your monotheism.gtAlso with your idea there is no such thing a monotheism.Yes you are exactly correct. I think that monotheism is what polytheism become when people glimpsed monist philosophy but fell back and tried to explain it through a dualistic mindset which creates a metaphysics where reality is separated between God and creation and God is paradoxically deemed all powerful and infinite but at the same time not encompassing the creation which is deemed separate sometimes only applying this separation to beings with souls at other times to all creation... I think in Islam only beings with souls are separate from God and have free will. This is paradoxical as it contradicts the supposed omnipotence of God. But it doesnt need to be so. It wouldnt be if people didnt try to understand God in the way they try to understand finite created things within reality.In some Hindu philosophies theyve fully reached a monist conception of God for example where there is a one God that is not monotheistic not separate from anything yet not diminished by being at one with the created finite entities Brahman. There are various names and conceptualizations for this like pantheism etc. but its fundamentally about the difference in mindsets between dualism and monism. Do you allow God to be so great that he permeates creation and every soul or do you separate God as the being with its own will separate from the free will of created souls. If the latter then there will be paradoxes if the former there will only be an infinite ineffable one God.gtThe major difference between this and polytheism is that trinity isnt called polytheism.And the major difference between a one God that has attributes and polytheism is that monotheism takes attributes from many different gods and gives them to one God thinking it a significant change. The words have changed but the message and the goal is the same the divine can be understood and used in the form of a religion. Its completely different from a monist philosophy where God isnt just an projection of human ideas unto the greatest reality but a way to give them up in humility in the understanding that God is greater and thus cannot be grasped with the mind or described in words.,islam,cy912nn,0,t5_2qhbp

6027500,0,t1_cy9ggi3,Personally from reading this entire thread I would say the key is to not attach religious importance.  So you for example are taking the day to chill with family.  No big deal.  Now I guess if you were going to midnight mass and praying to Jesus and whatever else that is attaching religious importance to the day thus the issue.If you had off Christmas Eve or the  which is a Saturday by chance but people work Saturdays too and chill with fam then it is no different than the .I guess a lot of it comes down to the origin of the reason you are doing something.  Personally I dont really attach religious importance to the day.  However I still can wish people Merry Christmas.  Like today I left the gym and wished my team members and coach Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.  Why?  Because it is a time of year for most and again I attach no religious importance to anything.  And Im not an asshole.,islam,cy9q5e9,1,t5_2qhbp

6050289,0,t3_3ye5kh,The testimony of women is equal to men in every case mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah and this does not nullify it. In this case the testimony of a single man is not accepted either as he needs another one present as well. However when the second one is not present you have a woman there who then needs another woman to be a guarantor there.The reasoning for this has been debated but it is mostly because financial matters are not something women are obligated to participate in in Islam they can if they want to but they are not required to unlike men who are obligated to be part of it as they are obligated to finance their wives and children. This obviously makes it so that there will always be more men in this area than women. The other woman is there to guarantee the woman is not being coerced or pressured into giving a testimony in a field where there arent as many women as men. If you read the fiqh another woman of the same household can also be rejected as the guarantor but it is not the general case.The obligation is not upon women to work in financial matters for your household. When men are obligated to do that naturally there will be more of them working in this sector in comparison to women who have been given a choice unlike men. This is actually something in the favour of women and a burden for men. This is how gender roles work in Islam women are given an advantage in a few areas of life and men are given advantage in others.Most importantly this is concerning writing a debt contract. Do you see how coercion is an actual concern when it comes to debt? You have people dying today in all areas of the world because of debt contracts and it is actually a common thing in poorer parts of the world.So the other woman is there as a guarantor to confirm the testimony and is not there as a strictly separate witness. This is one very specific case in finance debt and to use it as if it makes it look like women are not equal to men is intellectually dishonest as we have plenty of other verses and narrations one would have to throw out of the window to hold that view.The Quran is timeless but there are verses within it that apply to a specific context. It doesnt nullify its timelessness.,islam,cycp216,41,t5_2qhbp

For me an organized congregation forcing me to believe in what they do as opposed to what I do is wrong.  Fundamentally I am a Christian and I follow Christian doctrine but I dont subscribe to many of the interpretations of the Bible that an established church holds.  Am I damned in the eyes of God for this?  Not according to the Bible I have accepted Jesus as my savior which according to the Bible is one of the things I must do to be accepted into Gods Kingdom.

Sometimes these questions may seem to have political undertones intentional or unintentional which affects the answers you are going to get.Yeah these things are really challenging for this reason.

For instance there may be an undiscovered hadith that says DNA is the genetic information that is propagated from parents amp someone will say ITS A MIRACLE!! All that needs to be done is enough time to pass for it to sound authentic enough. Besides that  the hadiths were written centuries after the Prophets death and also ironically hadith collections continued to grow centuries after that as well. Maybe to someone who says According to Science who is not schooled in the scientific method this may seem surprising but science isnt a thing. Its an intellectual activity of looking at the world objectively amp through experiment.Secondly the number of joints in the human body depends on age and definition. For example before puberty the hip bone still consist of three bones i.e. ilium pubis ischium. The mandible i.e. jawbone on the other hand consists of two bones fused together in a symphysis a connection between two bones not regarded as a joint. An adult has over  bones and about  joints where movements can occur but for example in the sacroiliac joint movements only occurs in pregnant women.Realistically according to   based on the following gross and very negotiable rulesjoints with little movement are ignored e.g the sutures in the skull.anatomically different yet functionally codependent joints are taken as one e.g the wrist and ankle are taken to be three joints on each side.individual variations are ignored and the most common variation chosen e.g two floating ribs. if you include the ribs as well.

Abu Bakr rejected her witnesses who testified that that was the case so she then had to claim it as inheritance instead because in Abu Bakrs mind it was still the Prophets property when he died and therefore would fall under the category of inheritance.  Fatima as and those who knew the truth knew it wasnt inheritance but because Abu Bakr wouldnt accept that fact they had to go about it a different way.gtThat is to say th if memory serves me correctly of ALL the war booty for ALL wars went to the household of the Prophet. If Abu Bakr wanted to force Fatima into financial hardship why is he giving her the war booty?He didnt want to force her into hardship to say that he was doing this purely out of malice towards her is a strawman.  Obviously if he could benefit without harming her in the process then it would be in his best interests to do it that way.  But if you for example own land and also own a business separately and someone comes and usurps your land would you be happy that youre still receiving the cash flows from the business even though the land title isnt in your name any longer? No youd still be unhappy that land that you should be owning is now no longer owned by you any cash flows outside of that are just red herrings.gtwhen this same Umar becomes Khalifah Ali remains a trusted adviser to him?!Umar instituted so many innovations in the religion the only way to keep the religion safe was to have Imam Ali close to try to discourage them whenever possible.  If Imam Ali were to rebel then a faction of Muslims would be totally misguided and only whoever chose to follow him would be guided.  But because he had the patience to endure what he did the whole ummah remains til this day at least at some basic level guided.gtthis same Umar becomes Khalifah Ali remains a trusted adviser to him?! If your boss murdered your wife would you stay his employee?! Not only that would you be a loyal employee to him?He wasnt loyal to Umar he was loyal to the ummah.  What he did was for the good of the ummah it wasnt for Umars good.  The fact that Umar benefited is a side effect not the intended goal.  If youre Sunni youd assume that he wanted to help Umar but thats a false assumption Umar being helped is a side effect.gtwould you marry your own daughter to him?Never happened.gtAli sends himself and his two sons to protect UthmanAgain out of good for the ummah.  Its not proper that Muslims should start killing each other when issues arise and standing up for that value is more important.  The fact that Uthman benefited is again a side effect not the intended goal.gtThe Shia would have you say that for two decades Ali was practicing taqiyyah out of fear.Not out of fear for himself but rather out of fear of destroying the ummah.gtdo Shia not realize that their narrative paints the man they supposedly respect so much as a complete total yellowbellied coward?!No its not out of cowardice but rather out of patience.  Imam Ali was one of the most patient people who ever lived for enduring what he endured.gtOr if you look at things logically you will note that when the Prophet saw passed away he was in his s while Abu Bakr was in his s. Given that Arab society did not consider one mature enough for leadership until their s Ali was not ready for leadership.Arab society also buried their daughters.

It doesnt necessarily mean theyre married. Married means the nikkah is done that is the wedding contract is signed by the bride and groom. This is usually done at the wedding meaning an engaged couple isnt considered married. Some couples may do the nikkah at the engagement or before the actual wedding ceremony. Reason being Islam is very strict on interactions between men and women who arent married. By having the nikkah done beforehand a man and woman can date spend time alone together. The marriage isnt consummated and the woman does move in with her husband until after the wedding ceremony. lol I knew u were gonna ask me the same questionnaire you asked everyone else. Im in my late s and am of Pakistani descent and have lived in the USA and Canada. The  countries are very similar not very religious depending on where you live and zinah is common. It has been for decades though maybe its becoming more common as time goes by I dont know. As far as the Muslim community in these countries they are more religious than the general population and zinah is less common. It is probably more common than in countries like Pakistan though being influenced by the surrounding culture easier to avoid social backlash more opportunity etc.gtSo none for men?I think this was in my previous post but I was saying the backlash is greater for women not that it doesnt exist for men. My parents would freak out if I was sleeping around im a dude same with any guy from a practicing Muslim family. If a guy has practicing Muslims in his social circle there may be some backlash from them but it is greater for women. gtSad. One of the reasons I dislike Catholicism is this. Are you taking about all Muslim or just your country?I am speaking of the American and Canadian Muslim communities as well as the Pakistani Muslim community in Pakistan and abroad.

Those unto whom We gave the Scripture aforetime know that it is revealed from thy Lord in truth. So be not thou O Muhammad of the waverers.  In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is no invented story but a confirmation of the existing Scripture and a detailed explanation of everything and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe.gtThe Ulema interpet these kinds of verses as Allah didnt leave anything out from the Quran regarding Imaan Tawheed and the basic tenets of Islam. He made it clear to understand.Sure so why is the Hadith needed if nothing is left out and the basic tenets of Islam are clear in the Quran?  gtWhoever obeys the messenger he was obeyed AllahThis one troubles me.  I could be wrong but the other Biblical prophets point people back to Gods law or God spoke through them Thus saith the LORD.  I dont recall an instance where a prophet tells the people to obey them as a person. Jesus said to obey him but he was not an ordinary prophet in Christianity.  Paul said follow me as I follow Christ but this is also pointing back to God.  I dont know of a prophet that said obey me as if you are obeying God.  How is that not shirk?gtIf you believed in the Quran as a timeless book and that God was speaking to you through it then why would God say this when Muhammed saw is already dead? Because the HADITHS are still there. Sure but it depends how God wants you to live.  It seems the Hadith have opened the door for an excess burden and fear of doing the wrong things with almost every step you take.eat with the right hand dont wear red if you are a man sleep on your right side dont dye your hair black dont let a black dog interrupt your prayer sit while drinking water etc.  How do you know what is really required vs recommended?  How do you keep track of it all?  How are you not constantly afraid of failure?  There are two simple commands Jesus quoted from the OT that can guide your life.love God love others.  If you live these two commands out to the fullest everything else will fall into place.gtAll the scholars have a consensus that Hadiths are equal to the Quran in Hukum acting upon them is Obligatory because of Allahs words instructing us to do so.Ok but you are trusting men who lived hundreds of years after Muhammads death to record what he did or did not do.

And even if they werent I should criticize atheist attempts at misrepresenting islam whenever I want.gt and youre worried what some atheists on YouTube dont get it?Im not worried about anything. I found a new ridiculous argument and thought people should hear about it. If I was worried I would debunk their whole video line by line.And saudi doesnt say women driving ban is based on the quran they say that if they allowed driving much worse things would happen.

From the getgo he trys to establish the connection between the Assad regime and the West thereby creating the everpresent paradigm in Islamist thought that all evil dictators are backed by the West and creating a reason for Muslims to hate the Westwhen in actuality Hafez also maintained close relations with many Muslim states.He also throws in Israels possible support for the Assad regime. Once again an Islamist propaganda technique to deligitimize Muslim governments by trying them with the evil Zionists. Ironic considering that Israel and Syria have not even signed a peace treaty and that Israelis have been treating Islamists and FSA members in hospitals close to the Golan Heightsmuch to the chagrin of Israeli Druze. But in general his construction of a Western backed Assad government which is B.S. possible Israeli support believing that Im a Shia and creating a sectarian narrative and his complete rejection of all sources as they are thinktanks and made for policy making just reeks of subtle Islamist propaganda. ,islam,czbasuw,5,t5_2qhbp

6481069,0,t1_czpnhth,Youre misunderstanding what Im saying and the context of my points. I am  not justifying child marriages today definitely not. What I am saying is that when you look at the context of the marriage between the Prophetpbuh and Aishapbuh based on the practices of the time the situations they were in the general understanding with regards to the girls then they way they were brought up they way her marriage took place the way the Prophetpbuh treated her her understanding and subsequent experience and benefit we can understand how and why that marriage took place. That was a unique situation which cannot be applied today especially when one studies and understand what happened then. What I was explaining in my last comment is possible condition of Aishapbuh at the time of consummation based on what I have seen first hand.Anyone that truly studies the marriage between the Prophetpbuh and Aishapbuh will not only tell you that it was a unique situation but its something that is not recommended today without a doubt. Just because I witnessed things first hand it doesnt mean I had a lack of empathy for them and I wasnt even in a Muslim country. Muslim or NonMuslim either way I am still against child marriages today in any form because I know what Islam permits and what are the requirements at the time of marriage. ,islam,czpovcd,0,t5_2qhbp

Things have definitely changed.  Im routinely taken aback by the general unwillingness to discuss controversial subject matters with some fellow Muslims without them resorting to passive aggression or just flatout going on the warpath.That said studying the other major traditions of the world including some Native American traditions was one of the best things Ive ever done as a Muslim.

No one is a perfect Muslim and if you get hung up on a single indiscretion of their faith while completely ignoring how they are striving or their struggles then what kind of spouse are you really? What kind of Muslim are you in real life. How would you feel  if someone wrote you off as Muslim by name only without talking to you?OP chances are you have had interest in one or two sisters right?

We also consider it a theory as well as a fact that nothing can exceed the speed of light. If we have a lot of evidence to beleve something is true we consider it a fact and ascribe it the title of a theory. It is a fact because as far as we can tell it actually is true and it is a theory because we recognize that as new information because available we can adjust our understanding of things and maybe even adopt an entirely new understanding. The term theory is an acknowledgement of the fact that understanding can change.

A Muslim is not doing their duty if they are not actively learning how to properly practice their religion. There were three men who once approached the Prophet who wanted to express their devotion to his cause. One said that he would fast every day. The other said he would pray the whole night every night. The last said he would remain celibate his whole life. The Prophet disagreed with their ways. He said that fasts some days and breaks his fast on others prays for some of the night and sleeps for some and fulfills the desires of the body through marriage. He told them that no one is more faithful than their Prophet and whoever takes more extreme measures than him is not from his people. In terms of the more extreme and violent examples today it is silly to think that violating the principles of your own religion could be called an act of devotion. ,islam,d0jadwq,4,t5_2qhbp

6907045,0,t1_d0z89xj,Personally I think the idea of a creator just replaces questions about the origins with the universe with questions about the origins of the creator which usually have equally unsatisfying answers at least in my experience.Also how do you make the assumptions you need to make about the nature of a creator in order to narrow it down to the Islamic description? Assuming the creator has to be allpowerful and allperfect how do we know theyre involved directly in human life? How do you rule out a deist conception of the universe?Not trying to disprove your beliefs just genuinely curious what your responses to these are.I do plan to read about the life of Muhammad but its difficult from my perspective to sort what can be verified from what cant  since most of the historians who described his life were Muslim and thus biased and I cant say with absolute certainty that those people were above getting parts of his life wrong or just writing what they thought should be true instead of what was actually true or exaggerating details or etc.That said I dont think less of you and I dont think youre being irrational.

6931946,0,t3_4annol,It is a ridiculous campaign and they lack real evidence for their justification. The reality is this during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammed pbuh there were Muslims living in Abyssinia under a government not legislated by Sharia. Those Muslims not only lived there but also participated in the processes which were laid out by that nonIslamic nation to handle their affairs. When they had grievances or needed protection they went to the king. They did not sit in their huts and just make prayers to God for assistance out of the sky. Some may argue that these Muslims went to live in Abyssinia prior to an Islamic government being established in Medina and so they are an exception. This is not an accurate picture. Firstly there is no rule of government today which clearly and only follows the law of Allah. Secondly those Muslims living in Abyssinia continued to live there well after the establishment of an Islamic government in Medina. They remained there for several years while at any point the Prophet pbuh could have called for them return if it was not permitted. Id also like to point out that those who oppose voting are still very much in support of this system. Do they not pay taxes? What can show more support than financial contribution? And if they say that is done without choice there is always a choice one can choose to move elsewhere.

Muslims are disproportionately affected and fall victim to terrorism but none of you guys ever stand in solidarity with us. We are always expected to stand in solidarity with you. You cant expect to wage war in our lands redraw our borders remove our leaders fund actors in power vacuums of which you have no clue about wage proxy wars with other states in these theatres and then tell us we have to do something about this problem. What are you doing? Muslims have been telling you guys for decades that your experiments in statecraft arent going to bod well for anyone in the world. And yet we are either laughed at or ignored. Muslims have been telling you guys for decades to stop funding nefarious non state actors and you guys never listen. The worst part about all of this is that white westerners and Europeans are going to take their anger out on the very people that are fleeing ISIL and the theatres of war that you guys have been actively engaged in for decades. Muslims will always be the victims. Muslims are the ones that will get bombs dropped on them. Theyre the ones that will have drones flying over their weddings.

For events to occur they must have a finite chain of causes. If you havent watched those two videos please do watch them carefully. It absolutely necessitates God. They posit that there is a necessarily existing cause of the Universe. Occams razor limits it to a single cause. The cause of the Universe has to be beyond the universe itself. So you arrive at attributes like spacetime transcendent eternal and immaterial extremely powerful and intelligent. For intelligence you can look up finetuning of the universe Which is very very close to the monotheistic concept of God in JudaismIslam.This cause of the universe cannot not exist because of necessary existence as opposed to contingent existencenot having a beginning. So weve ruled out multiple gods and a god ceasing to exist. And no god at all is impossible because of contingent existence of the universeit beginning to exist. Agnosticism is probable.

7177509,0,t1_d1tvv3c,Sorry you feel this way. Given that Ive been on this sub for a few years and have tried to give a realistic picture of Muslim and non muslim relationships which has helped a few people. I think according to our faith and way of life. Im simply allowing Muslims to see things in a way that would allow them to objectively consider their relationships and the sacrifices that will be involved if such relationships are perused. Im an American Muslim. In my younger days didnt really care about protecting myself and others from entering into relationships with me. I must have been . Just out of H.S in to early college. Started hanging out with a lab partner. Very nice person. When it became apparent we both had feelings for each other We talked about it. Being a Muslim I told her I cant have physical contact with her. Thats only allowed after marriage. She seemed like she was ok with just hanging out. Come Ramadan time told her that I cant hang out as its Ramadan and Im trying to avoid all things forbidden like talking to her late going on dinner dates etc. It was tough on her and she got angry about this making her feel disrespected. Me trying to limit our interaction for the sake of my religion was my prerogative But it wasnt hers. She was understandably upset and offended. I felt horrible about not considering her thoughts and feelings and I felt horrible about having to chose between following my religion VS compromising my religion for her sake. It had become painfully apparent that If I move away from my religious obligations because of her then at some low point in the future I may end up blaming her for me loosing a huge part of my life. It was unfair for me to want to be close to her but also make myself unavailable. It was unfair for me to expect her to accept the limited interaction that I was willing to offer. For us Muslims we have to take these things into consideration before getting into relationships that are a norm for the average westerner. Given that the brother came to rIslam for advice and not rRelationships One should understand that He is concerned about his religion as well. If religion and religious dos and donts werent a concern for him the brother wouldnt have come here. So when we share our experiences and try to give advice Its going to be advice from an Islamic perspective as the receiver of the advice is specifically here for advice that considers this very perspective. Its also highly unlikely that this perspective will be taken to heart by  most people here. But having read these points itd allow people who dont usually think things throughas I did back in the day to actually be aware of situations they might get in to. Dont worry were not surprised that you find our way of life odd but our challenges experiences and interactions do matter to us and well share with each other how best to handle these things while being a Muslim. ,islam,d1u0n37,3,t5_2qhbp

7204444,0,t3_4e4tza,gt Firstly it is true that I am a man. I have not experienced such things as pregnancy. As such it would be ridiculous for me to discuss the pains and joys of pregnancy. In other words I am not qualified to speak about pregnancy from a first person perspective. However when it comes to issues that I can experience  like general injustice or issues which have been related to me or taught to me in an academic environment  then I am qualified to speak about them. So for instance if I were a medical doctor or had witnessed the pregnancy of many women and empathized with their struggles and joys then I have a right to speak about those things for which I am aware. In the case of last nights talk this is extremely relevant not only because I am aware of the secondary sources which I am using to justify my stance but also because I have actually been educated in the field of philosophy which greatly helps to inform me about the ideology behind FeminismThis doesnt even answer the question the reason people are complaining is why a woman was not picked to talk about womens suffering not specifically whether you are qualified or not.Nevertheless there are many issues women face that most men simply cannot identify with such as rape and assault and fear of both those things. gt Secondly there is a huge double standard here at play the underlying assumption being that only women can talk about women. Nevermind the fact that underlying assumption behind mainstream feminism is MALE DOMINATION i.e. patriarchy  which essentially means women talking about men. In other words feminists dont seem too concerned with consistency when it comes to them speaking about the other gender. Hate to break this to you but if youre going to make another gender the culprits of your struggles then you should be prepared to expect that gender to tell their side of the story. Last time I checked no such patriarchy exist especially given the fact that its blatantly obvious that most men in the world dont take advantage of it. Lower life expectancy? More likely to die at the workplace? Most income going towards women and children? Expendable in major disasters? Punished more for similar crimes committed by women? Overwhelmingly always loses custody battles and divorce cases?Of course patriarchy exists whether it is a bad thing or not is a different issue but this is obvious to anyone who takes just a cursory look at history. Laws assumed that men were the decision makers in mostly everything this is patriarchy. Men being the ones called to war men giving what they spend to women and children and so on is all due to patriarchy as well. So if you see these things as negative maybe you should hate patriarchy as wellgt You would think if men were in such oppressive control normatively speaking wed be the ones to stay at the house and make the women work. Wed be the ones to take the lifeboats first when the Titanic starts to sink. Wed be the ones getting the easy sentencing during trial the ones gaining custody and not losing half our assets in a divorce case.But alas these are not considered disadvantages to feminists because feminists dont think about justice  they think about themselves. They do not think about the fact that the people they approach to change the laws in their favor are overwhelmingly men. The ones that protect them from other abusive men are overwhelmingly men. The ones that do all the horribly dangerous and grueling work such as building roads fixing sewer pipe lines and growing most of our food are overwhelmingly men. The ones serving in the armed forces and die as a result  are overwhelmingly men.This is actually quite pathetic women generally suffer quite a lot far more than having a job as a labourer and being in the army think rape harassment and mental illness.gt The very internet computers and smart phones they use to complain about men  were overwhelmingly made by men.This is hilariously irrelevantgt And this of course is not to say that women are not special and dont deserve praise. Women can and often do the same things as men and even better in many cases. There are wonderful women doctors academics and scholars. There are wonderful mothers wives and sisters. But to say we are totally equal? To say there are no major normative differences? To say all exceptions are the rule?Should I now campaign for all men to stay at home and take care of the kids because a few fathers are equal or better at it then many women? No. Should I restrict access to that role? Not at all. But to claim we are ? That would be absurd. Theres a reason Islam says that the mother deserves more respect than the father.This doesnt even answer the contention he simply says But to claim we are ? That would be absurd. Though he boasts his education in philosophy it evidently has not helped him form a coherent argument.gt But l digress. Perhaps what is more important to say is that according to feminists I have no right to speak about the struggles of my strong and loving mother who raised me as a single parent when I was a child. You can but why not allow a woman to talk about woman issues instead? Again coming back to the first point the author simply doesnt address why people are complaining in the first place. It is obviously more appropriate to have women speak so why not provide that platform?gt According to feminists I have no right to speak about the fact that my wife is intelligent educated strong and has been through things which I still have yet to understand in full  but respect her for tremendously. Do they?gt According to feminists I have no right to speak about the struggles of other women coauthoring an academic paper on gender rights in the Muslim world attached below.Do they?gt According to feminists I have no right to state the fact that all mainstream feminists organizations pushed for and supported the illegal war in Iraq for the sake of saving Muslim women from oppression  This requires citation to be sure there are some movements within feminism that can be characterized as white feminism which indeed lacks cultural sensitivity but this is as representative of feminism as racist Muslims are of Islamic views of race. gt According to feminists I have no right to speak about the philosophy behind mainstream western feminism despite having two degrees in philosophy.He is not educated in the philosophy of gender and feminism though. A philosopher of aesthetics for example has no right to speak about the philosophy of religion. Though they may be able to probe the fields in similar ways nothing the philosopher of aesthetics will say is in any way authoritative. gt According to feminists men and women arent in this together we apparently dont need each other and we dont compliment each other  rather women only need women.Do they?gt What is more saddening is that Muslim women who claim to be feminists  who claim they dont need men to speak for them  apparently dont need our Prophet Muhammad sallAllahu alayhi wasallam either.Do they? mostly they dont to claim they do requires a substantial amount of evidence.Its interesting to see this weird alliance between MRA losers and a Muslim man.

Lol.For your information there are many narrations of these hadith with very different wording. It is standard practice in fiqh and hadith to look at all different wordings of hadith to fully understand what it means.gtIt is better for a mans belly to be stuffed with pus which corrodes it than to stuff ones mind with frivolous poetry. Sahih MuslimReferring to a specific type of poetry.Other hadith on poetrygt Ubayy b. Kab reported the Prophet May peace be upon him as saying In poetry there is wisdom. Abu Dawud Sahih according to AlAlbanigt Allahs Messenger  said Some poetry contains wisdom. Bukharigt Abdullah ibn Amr reported that the Messenger of Allah may Allah bless him and grant him peace said Poetry is in the same position as speech. The good of it is like good words and its bad part is like bad words. Sahih according to AlAlbani from Imam Bukharis kitab al adabgtWe went out to Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While we were proceeding at night a man from the group said to Amir O Amir! Wont you let us hear your poetry? Amir was a poet so he got down and started reciting for the people poetry that kept pace with the camels footsteps saying O Allah! Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In charity nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us what we have committed i.e. our defects let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina i.e. calmness Upon us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy and If they will call us towards An unjust thing We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others help Against us. The Prophet  on that asked Who is that camel driver reciting poetry? The people said He is Amir bin AlAkwa. Then the Prophet  said May Allah bestow His Mercy on him. A man amongst the people said O Allahs Prophet! has martyrdom been granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer. Then we reached and besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims conquer it i.e. Khaibar. In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city the Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet  said What are these fires? For cooking what are you making the fire? The people replied For cooking meat. He asked What kind of meat? They i.e. people said The meat of donkeys. The Prophet  said Throw away the meat and break the pots! Some man said O Allahs Messenger ! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots instead? He said Yes you can do that too. So when the army files were arranged in rows for the clash Amirs sword was short and he aimed at the leg of a Jew to strike it but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own knee and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle Allahs Messenger  saw me in a sad mood. He took my hand and said What is bothering you? I replied Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the deeds of Amir are lost. The Prophet  said Whoever says so is mistaken for Amir has got a double reward. The Prophet raised two fingers and added He i.e. Amir was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few Arabs who achieved the like of good deeds Amir had done.

They dont control the Internet. If parents want they can set up parental controls on the devices their children use which seems like a much more sensible solution.And who watches porn in public? Thats just weird.EDIT as a UK citizen I remain opposed to David Camerons move to have parental controls as the default setup. For one thing that move wasnt based on any evidence at the time  it was based on the conservative values of his party. It was an attempt to use shame as a vehicle for institutionalising the values of the people in power and it was terrible.For the record I do agree that a computer technician who discovers child pornography on a computer should report it although I dont think they should go looking for it.

7373934,0,t1_d2gak2u,Like I said the vast majority of general hadiths like how to Pray or How to do Hajj pay Zakat and how to do the basics are agreed upon. The basic Aqeedah is also agreed upon.The difference comes usually when the Shias come across something they dont like in a Sunni hadith because it was narrated by Abu Bakr and they take that Hadith and make a fake narration with a bogus Isnad from it.If youre an unbiased Muhadith you can check yourself who the narrators are I garantee you they were all bogus people either they never existed or their timelines dont overlap so its not possible they met.Btw the criteria for checking if a hadith is trustworthy or not is generally the same in all  hadiths minus the Shia filter system of the Sahaba they hate.

7405202,0,t1_d2jwrqb,Okay. Okay. Lets see what AlHafid Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir said about Music Then lets see what AlHafid Ibn Hajar translates AlMaaazif used in a Prophetic Hadith to describe Music. He writes in Fath Al BarigtBy Allah Maaazif is the plural of mizafah and refers to musical instruments. Fath alBari Ibn Hajar also saysgtThe authentic Prophetic Hadiths refer to drums flutes and other instruments which are struck or beaten as forbidden. Fath alBari Ibn Kathir narrates that Hassan AlBasri saidgtThe verse in Luqman was revealed concerning singing and musical instruments. Ibn Kathir Bukhari narrates gtAmong my ummah there will certainly be people who permit Adultery Silk Alcohol and Musical Instruments. Ibn Hazm claimed that it was a Daif Hadith because he couldnt find the Mawsool Sanad However Ibn Hajar proved him wrong by citing the full Authentic Sanad graded Sahih and Qawi by Imam Tabarani and Imam AlBayhaqi. AlAlbani also graded it Sahih.Ibn AlQayim writesgtThe Madhab of Abu Hanifah may Allah have mercy on him has the harshest stance on Music. Abu Hanifahs students clearly stated that it is forbidden to listen to all musical instruments such as the flute and the drum even tapping a stick. They stated that it is a sin which implies that a person is a evil doer whose testimony should be rejected. They went further than that and said that enjoying it is kufr. This is their words.He later continues by quoting Abu Yusuf the student of Imam Abu Hanifah about MusicgtAbu Yoosuf said about a house from which could be heard the sound of Musical Instruments Go in without their permission because forbidding evil actions is obligatory and if it were not allowed to enter without permission people could not have fulfilled the obligatory duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.

Nor would I encourage anyone to go to Jordan and live with the Keller cult. The reports we are getting from there and the damaged murids we are seeing in Cairo we need to avoid these people at all cost. A simple remedy. When you go to study some place ask yourself where is the memorization of the Quran its study and the Sunna? Where is the fiqh and the Usol? Ive been told that the buy Nuh Kellers sweaty clothes nasty old miswaks and so on. This is not Islam this is Hislam. This is not an issues of sufi salafi this is an issue of a Jim Jones type cult......That being said I would like to make it clear that I have found instances of families being broken by this group and witnessed an intolerance from some of their followers that borders on bigotry..I do not agree with Nuh Keller his followers nor with what Sunnipath pushes as being mainstream.Unfortunately I find many similarities between such groups and the very churches I attended before my Islam. I would not encourage anyone to go to Jordan to live with them nor take fatwa or courses from Sunnipath.Unity has its price and we cannot use it to justifythe strange opinions found at Sunnipath.American Muslim leadership has a responsibility to stand up in front of any group that threatens the social fabric of our communities and pushes strange opinions off as though they are the norm.Please accept this sincere advice amp do not let your nafs or pride make you stray away from the truth.

One should not indulge in music or in any habit so much so to ignore ones obligations. Dr. Muzammil H. Siddiquigt AlQaradawi in his book AlHalal wa AlHaram has elaborated on the topic of music and singing.  There is nothing wrong with listening to clean music.

This reeks havoc on your eeman and will cause doubts to spring up. That horrible feeling you have is a good sign that your eeman is still there.

Dont give up that prayer shaytan wants to slowly bring you to that where the connection is completely severed. Dont let him do that. Youve come so far by wearing hijab for so long many people who were born Muslim havent been able to do what youve done with Allahs help. All the sacrifice and work you put into wearing it dont let shaytan take all those good deeds from you. May Allah ease your hardship and purify you and us all.As a revert myself know that guidance is not something you can just get it only comes from Allah. That means He sees something in you to guide you to the truth that most people dont have. You may be struggling right now but dont give up sister!,islam,d3sxu3s,9,t5_2qhbp

7838965,0,t3_4mopue,Its a bit complicated but heres the long explanation. If you want the short explanation its because people are dumb.Although we think about the issue the most when it comes to Ramadan the real reason behind it has nothing to do with Ramadan and everything to do with Eid ul Adha. If you can understand the emotional response to that you can understand why people follow the Saudi calendar for Ramadan.Eid ul Adha is defined as the th day of Dhul Hijjah. That shouldnt be a controversial statement but boy youd be shocked at how many people dont grasp what that means. It means that whenever Dhul Hijjah starts thats Day  of the month and Day  will be Yaum al Arafah and Day  will be Eid ul Adha. Except a lot of people and to be frankly honest people from a certain region of the world dont really see Eid ul Adha as the th of Dhul Hijjah but rather as the day when the hujjaj leave Arafah. They see the date as secondary to what is happening at hajj. Not to sound sarcastic but as someone I know put it They think Eid ul Adha is Eid ul Hajj. So they see it as irrelevant if its the th of Dhul Hijjah where theyre living if the hujjaj are fasting that day at Arafah they think its inconceivable that we should be celebrating Eid. We literally had someone say to our imam How can we possibly be celebrating Eid when the guests of Allah are toiling at Arafah? An argument made out of emotion not evidence. It doesnt matter which scholar you bring they dont care. Heck bring the ulema of Saudi Arabia itself saying that its not a problem and they dont care theyll insist on following Saudi Arabia. Sh. Uthaymeen was asked about this and he was very blunt You fast on the th you celebrate Eid on the th regardless of what the hujjaj are doing. But if you insist on making your Eid coincide with when the hujjaj are celebrating it you have to follow Saudi moonsighting since the hujjaj are in Saudi Arabia. So people follow Saudi Arabia for Dhul Hijjah. Now heres the rub. A calendar is a calendar. You cant pick one method for one month and another method for another month and a third method for a third month. You have to be consistent or its not a calendar. So if you insist on following Saudi Arabia for Dhul Hijjah by necessisity you have to follow Saudi Arabia for the other months which would include Ramadan. And thats why so many Muslims in the west at least those from a certain cultural background follow Saudi moonsighting. Of course then youve got people who dont understand any of this and follow Saudi for Dhul Hijjah and local sighting for Ramadan. Makes absolutely no sense but dont tell them that they get mad no really we had a group break off one year and do their own Eid when our imam pointed out the inconsistency.,islam,d3x61d8,5,t5_2qhbp
7842266,0,t1_d3x44x7,gtIm talking in general terms. Humans are said to be the greatest creation of AllahAgain where? GO through the Quran. It doesnt say that. it says those who believes are the greatest. This incorporates Jinn humans and what ever is out there. gtHowever if you are going to consider specifics what about the Holy Prophet ? In a sense Allah  chose him because he is the single best creation according to what Ive heard. Why would God choose a human to undertake this great task?Some one else already answered this. Because we have no access to the Jinn. So if the Prophet saws was a Jinn. Since Jinn are powerful we wouldnt be able to take example from him saw. Same reason why the Prophet saws wasnt angel.gtIf you want to take this a step further essentially Im asking the same question Iblis did without the whole questioning Gods authority part. Why should a jinn a more powerful being which also has free will bow down to a human?Doesnt matter. Ibis was racist and God called him out on it. That was the reason. Same reason why Prophet saws came from the arabs. To point the hypocrisy of the Bani Israel of that time. ,islam,d3xjewg,1,t5_2qhbp

He wrote back Present to him the tenets of Islam. If he understands them then present Islam to him. If he refuses then strike his neck. But if he did not know them then reimpose the jizya and leave him alone.gt Abd alRazzaq alSanani d.  AH CE. AlMusannafIve discussed this in the Essay. Like I said Islam respects the right to have differences. So if someone didnt know the basics of Islam or concerted to Islam for the wrong reasons he cant be killed for Apostasy clearly. Everyone agrees on this. The problem here comes when someone who willingly accepted Islam and knowing of its tenants and clearly accepted Islam without being forced or something else apostatizes. Should he be killed or not? I take the classical view. Others take the modern view its clearly modern btw no one tries to deny as far as I know. gtIt is narrated from Ibn Abbas that he said The female apostate is not killed. This is because the unbelief of the woman is not equal to the unbelief of the man  which leads to physical devastation. So she is not equal in the liability to be killed as is known.Ill give you this. This is a classical disagreement between the scholars. Ibn Umar Ibrahim and Imam AlBukhari believed the female was still to be killed though. Imam Abu Hanifah and Ibn Abbaas said otherwise.Also like I said Minor and Major Apostasy is something that exists naturally. Its common sense that Men pose more a threat when they Apostate than Women. The thing I say here is that are both apostates to be killed? Also there are a few things to point out here The opinon that Women shouldnt be killed is in the minority among the classical scholars. Imam Abu Hanifah which is the biggest supporter for the opinon that women shouldnt be killed still prescribed life in prison for her which might even be worse than death if you ask me lol showing that punishment still applies here.gtIt is necessary to kill for apostasy to avert the evil of war not as punishment for the act of disbelief. Because the greatest punishment for that is with Allah. This the punishment of killing is for those who come with war and that is the man. This is because the Prophet prohibited killing women and the reason is because they do not fight.gt Muhammad ibn Abd alWahid alSiwasi Ibn alHummam d.  AH CE.

8028945,0,t1_d4ey7qf,I think you have to separate sex and sexuality here. Once homosexuality is decriminalised in a country there is no need for marches legal marriage etc to have sex. In the modern world there are many ways gay people can find lovers without political actions or parades etc.So any overt political action such as marches or campaigns for marriage concern the wider issue of sexuality equality legal rights or fighting against bigotry.I do agree that some people may be addicted to sex in the same way as some people become obsessed with religion shopping or any activity that provides a reward they learn to seek. I dont think the political and activist side of the gay movement can be reduced to just sex though. A pathological addiction to sex is quite a rare thing in my opinion in any community. A drug addict for instance would probably be perfectly happy just if their drug of choice was legally available and not require anything further such as political action.gt Look at gay pride parades tell me main theme is not about sexuality. Just Google gay pride parade. The parades were originally demonstrations and protest marches and the purpose of the parades were to some extent to shock and annoy people. If you dont you dont get press coverage. They were also about reclaiming the public space. This has changed over the years to often be a celebration of gay sexuality but I still feel the demonstration and protest aspect in public spaces is very important in countries that are still finding it difficult to accept homosexuality.gt How is it not a mental game HOW?I think thats like asking how you know if you are happy or depressed. Emotions do matter and some emotions may not be possible to understand easily for those who have not experienced them such as clinical depression.

When the Prophet may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon him finished he faced the people and said to them Do you know what your Lord has said? They said Allah and his Messenger know best. He said This morning one of my servants became a believer in Me and one a disbeliever. As for him who said We have been given rain by virtue of Allah and His mercy that one is a believer in Me a disbeliever in the stars  and as for him who said We have been given rain by suchandsuch a star that one is a disbeliever in Me a believer in the stars.  The preIslamic Arabs believed that rain was brought about by the movement of stars. This Hadith draws attention to the fact that whatever be the direct cause of such natural phenomena as rain it is Allah the Almighty who is the Disposer of all things.

8129040,0,t3_4qkr0u,WasalamI was curious about this too. Trust me you are not the only person with whom this verse does not sit well. I found a good discussion here and I implore you read it it is a linguistic analysis of the word daraba and makes a good case that in this verse it means to separate from your wives ie. to avoid them.please be aware that this is a quranist site. Take what you find good and leave the rest.The primary proof is linguistic. The word daraba is used several times in the Quran and means separate in those contexts. For example God thus separates the truth and falsehood . It means other things in other contexts. A good substitute word might be strike as you can strike hit something but you can also strike off move away or separate yourself from something. You can strike discover gold or strike make or shape a coin. Actually dont take my word for it look up the definition yourself.The second proof is the sunnah. When the Prophet saw was displeased with his wives did he hit them or separate himself from them?Lastly and this is my own opinion I think the translations and interpretations we have of the Quran today are the result of centuries of scholars trying to shoehorn a remarkably egalitarian faith into their own patriarchal culture. It is much better I think to read the Quran in its original Arabic for yourself if you can along with seerah of the Prophet. Islam is not meant to be a difficult or obscure faith. We are given clear instruction that any can follow.May Allah comfort you and reward you for seeking the truth. May He forgive me if I have said anything wrong.,islam,d4trzpx,4,t5_2qhbp

8132856,1,t1_d4tv41i,Here here! Its amazing how easily the simple minded are fooled into narratives. Britain getting its sovereignty back is a wonderful thing. In general the more local the government the better the larger the government the more corrupt and bloated it is and more power is taken from the individual. I doubt those who rail against the Brexit are wellinformed backers of the EU. Most have no idea whatsoever about how the institution even works or who runs it and I cant blame them as its such a complicated mess its almost as though its designed to be complicated and difficult for individuals to know or care about it. Just leave it to the elites you ignorant peasant. No what they do care about though is throwing around words like Xenophobe! XENOPHOBE!!! As though this word is an actual argument some sort of magical trump card that will instantly win an debate without the necessity of actually understanding the issue putting forth evidence or using logic. The saddest part is that they think this word has power when in fact it is completely impotent. You can call me a Xenophobe all you like. Dont care. Lets look at the definition. Xenophobe one unduly fearful of what is foreign and especially of people of foreign origin.First off even if you are a Xenophobe its not like thats some terrible thing. Plenty of people are arachnophobes but I dont judge them morally repugnant because their fear of spiders is a beyond a reasonable level. Secondly Xenophobe requires the Unduly part. Like an arachnophobe the xenophobe has a heightened fear of something that is legitimately to be feared at least to some degree. The mass importation of foreign peoples is certainly something to be apprehensive about. Doesnt matter where you are or what people youre talking about. When you import large quantities of people from a foreign culture and history it can and often does lead to a multitude of problems. These problems can range from economic to political to criminal to simple quality of life issues. Just ask the Native Americans. The so called xenophobes are simply those who raise the issue who understand human nature and human history and are concerned about the potential affects of mass immigration in contrast to the opposition which seems to believe that these immigration policies will lead to nothing but sunshine and singalongs and anyone who raises legitimate concerns must be an ignorant xenophobe or even worse...the dreaded RACIST! Do ignorant racist jerks exist? Of course! Does something like Brexit give them a little more courage to come out of their hidey holes of social ostracism? Yeah probably. Does that mean they represent all Brexit supporters? Youd have to be willfully stupid to believe that. Does the existence of these racists and the possibility that Brexit might embolden them a bit mean that we shouldnt support Brexit for fear of emboldening them? Of course not thats called living in fear youre essentially letting sensible policy be held as a hostage and for what?

It seems like these are still unanswered questions nowadays. Just like my own example I was born in France my parents were born in France my grandparents as well but somehow Im still not French enough because Im brown want to pray on time and my mom wears a hijab. No one ever annoyed my grandma for her hijab in the s. I have white French people daring to tell me that Im not French enough while I dont see what difference I have aside from my religionskin color. Then do they believe being French is not being religious?Truth is Im genuinely worried about the future. The more we go and the more I feel like the narrative is going towards a us vs them mentality which is the worst thing I could imagine see Trumps popularity. Im still rather young  and realize how big of an identity crisis I along with a lot of people my generation are facing what am I exactly? I identify as a Muslim from France so a French Muslim. But on one side I have French people telling me that I cant be French if Im too Muslim and on the other side others saying I cant be Muslim if Im too French. So what next?I just believe in living together in harmony celebrating our differences rather than using them to pit one against another just like Islam teaches.,islam,d598r4x,5,t5_2qhbp

8349629,0,t1_d5l8pyz,I uinderstand but even then. While Shariah is certainly not codified into set rules that we can easily identify and while differences do exist among scholars on what perfectly constitutes Shariah there are still obvious boundaries. For instances Shariah law MUST allow religious freedom and tolerance. I dont think I need to tell you how thats going in Saudi Arabia. Secondly the banking system in Shariah must be interestfree. Again I dont think I have to tell you the banking system Saudi relies on. I could go on and on. But my point is even a lot of the key distinguishable traits of the Shariah arent found in Saudi Arabia.To illustrate this in another way a Muslim professor in George Washington University conducted a research panel to organize and rank every single country in the world into a Muslim index panel aggregating data such as politics standard of living laws and how close they are to the ideal Islamic principles. You would think the countries that came out on top were Muslim countries but nope. The highest ranked country in this list was Ireland followed by the Netherlands country followed by Canada then UK. The two highest ranking Muslim country were Kuwait and Malaysia ranking  and  respectively. Saudi Arabia the country that claims to pride on Islam came out only at . Also FYI you should study the history of the four Khulafah after the prophet pbuh if you thought no human after the prophet pbuh personally stuck to Sharia law. Also it doesnt make sense to say no human practiced Shariah when Shariah is too flexible to even be codified so to imply that no human afterwards practiced Shariah is a bit naive claim when you dont even know what constitutes Shariah and what doesnt.,islam,d5l996g,3,t5_2qhbp

8546024,0,t1_d69t3pa,There is no Islamic rule that says girls must get married at such a young age.  The Shariah acts like a barebones structure into which a cultures preexisting or independent legal codes can fit. It defines boundaries for the rest of the law but is actually quite scant as compared to the level of complexity that is typical of legal codes of nations. It thus allows leaders and judges the government quite a lot of flexibility in choosing what to enforce to what extent and how. The only caveat being that it cannot violate the Shariah. This actualized legal doctrine the actual codified laws of a nation is also colloquially referred to as shariah by many if the government in question is theocraticreligious i.e the various Caliphates and Sultanates of history.The law which is distilled from the Shariah on the basis of the marriage of Aisha ra is as described above that the minimum age for sexual relations within marriage is the onset of puberty and that age where no harm comes to the person who is coming of age and the latter can only be discerned by the persons voluntary consent.This sets a minimum age. It does not encourage it. The Prophets other wives were of wildly varying ages. At around the time he married Aisha ra he also married Sawda ra who was !This means the minimum age set into law by an Islamic government can not be below this age but it can be above this age according to the cultural mores and norms involved. This is because violating the cultural norms of a people can qualify as psychological harm. If a culture is not grooming its children for adulthood until say  then a marriage at the age of  would be psychologically harmful for someone from that culture. Human beings are heavily dependent on socialization for psychological maturation we dont automatically become mature via biological mechanisms at a certain age like clockwork. We learn and are taught how to be adults. A child who is raised in a feral atmosphere by wild animals does not develop into a fully functioning person for example.,islam,d69tofm,7,t5_2qhbp

People in general will believe anything if you present it well enough and to abandon one belief when presented with new information requires much more energy than if that belief had never formed. Of course in todays world anyone can broadcast their opinions through YT Twitter etc and it is impossible to stop them but the aware ones amongst us should learn to ask ourselves whether we truly know what were talking about before we decide to open our mouthspost comments.I wouldnt call it elitist thinking rather qualified thinking.

Modesty is required of both men and women both men and women have a form of hijab that is required of them. Not because sexuality must be stigmatized or because a woman should be ashamed of her sexuality but the total opposite. The purpose is maintain the precious status of sexuality between a married couple and give it its due value as a way to bond with ones spouse and strengthen the relationship. This happens by not making sexuality a cheap social commodity. gtThe idea that a supposed omnipotent omniscient deity bothers with dress codes and dietary restrictions seems REALLY petty to me.That my friend is a long discussion that first starts with an in depth discussion of who and what is God what are His attributes the purpose of our creation the nature of man etc. before we get to why is God bothering with dress codes and dietary restrictions.

I did not have too many encounters with reverts I dont know many but the few I know are amazing in acting upon Islam.  I have read on some forums the struggles reverts go through. But each and every individual has their own kind of struggle. Even born muslims have to go through alot. Understand this thing that being born into a muslim family does not mean that you have islamic values. There are variety of people some will directly blame you call you names etc while others will love you and will welcome to give you their daughters. I know a revert brother he is also  and about to go to uni but he has been muslim since . And I know he has been getting marriage proposals even though he did not start it other brothers look at his enagagement in the masjid and proposed their sister to him  So in my opinion it depends on family that how much they are practicing in terms of good manners. And offcourse even you would like to marry into a family who is practicing islam not just culturally but by knowing what they are really following. If some sister is directly judging you then offcourse even you dont want to marry her its a red alarm in the first place! My advice to you is to focus more on Islamic values for now. Let some time pass. Engage in your community. If your uni has some student union etc become active member of it. Become visible. Remember the way you want to marry a practocing sister similarly it is even much more difficult for a sister to find a good practicing brother. Because they have much less means than man do for finding a spouse. This is the current state on ummah. May Allah improve it in future. I myself had to go to matrimony website in order to find a practicing sister. So even it is not just reverts overall ummah is in crisis when it comes to marriage.,islam,d6zn5la,1,t5_2qhbp

The Muslims were born into a world were slavery was a prevalent and unmovable commodity going as far back as recorded history Hunting Age. Then came the Ancient Romans and Persians the Hindus Chinese amp Egyptians followed by the Jews amp Christians.....By contrast of the rest of the world  its really quite remarkable how Muhammad pbuh handled human rights. Probably the most brutal of ancients were the Romans and Hindus while the most brutal of monotheistic religions were the Mosaic laws pertaining to slaves tho the be fair many of these law are misrepresented by antisemites....and they were outdone by the racist slave industry run by Christian circa th C..Those Muslims who committed these crimes are just as bad. But the actual teaching of Islam were revolutionary. To make a long story short Muhammad pbuh. Closed every avenue of slavery in a short position.. The only version of slavery to close w a long position was Prisoners of War for strategic and logistical reasons it was impossible to do it any other way.Like others have said this does not excuse Muslims who sold their countrymen for a profit even as recently as  Afghanistan War where US literally paid for prisoners to torture in Guantanamo.The Muslim civilization is the only one of its kind to have turned slaves into law makers rulers and kings. Some of them founded entire dynasties.......The Mamlukes of Egypt the Ghulams of India they were slaves. Most of the Abbassid Caliphs were sons of slaves. Some of the most influential scholars in history were freed slaves Hassan alBasri Ata ibn Rabia all of Ibn Abaas students.... Najm uDeen Ayyub  the Sultan of Salahudin was the son of a concubine and he become ruler and is first to defeat the Crusaders. Muhammad pbuh himself was the descendant of a slave a woman who hold unique royal position in Islam so much so that Muslims imitate her every year in Hajj. Islam was the religion of the slave. And for too many reasons to list black America identified herself with Islam in her fight for freedom a fight thats still going on today albeit under different terms.p.s. If youre interested in historical  records and theological textual details please Omar Suleimans Slavery A Past amp Present Tragedy There are many primary and secondary sources and this one nicely distinguishes between them and gives context.p.p.s. Im an African whose ancestry includes slaves and slaves that became scholars.,islam,d71cd45,2,t5_2qhbp

8886342,0,t1_d4ooagj,Hi sorry this is really late reply! Forgot about this. gt If the world was free of suffering the world would be a much better place. I dont get the point youre trying to make...Personally I would disagree with you. Speaking from personal experience if I never suffered I wouldnt know half the things I know today and I wouldnt know who the hell I am. I wouldnt have grown as much as I have without suffering. Its part of the human experience IMO.gt The problem that I have with the signs is that an all powerful supposedly used a book to prove his existence.I disagree. I dont think any books or messages have been meant to prove the existence of any higher power. People will already believe or not believe with or without books. Booksmessages are simply confirming the message. Theres a video on YouTube I once watched called False Prophets. It discusses how there is no such thing. Rather we all receive and interpret messages differently despite being the same message because of our own personal biasesexperiencespersonalitiesetc.gt Lets ask this question to you Religion is nothing more thank a way to live your life right?Thats not what religion means to me. Organized religion that dictates every part of your life is as ridiculous to me as I assume it is to you. Religionspirituality gives me peace. Thats why I stick to it. I found peace and I feel I am an overall better or at least more aware person because of it. gt So what is religion in a nutshell. It is something that people follow because they want purpose in their life.Perhaps. Maybe they already had purpose but religion adds to it. Gives them personal fulfillment. Peace. Etc.gt Now if we focus on Islan what is it? A supposed unneeding god created humans because he needed people to worship him Thats your perception of islam.  We dont share the same perception. As I said I dont like the term worship but rather serve because service has many meanings that extend past simple prayer  times a day or whatever. As you said yourself God doesnt need anything so this service is for our own benefit on an individual and collective scale. gt and he allowed those people to have the choice to disobey him. Those who disobey him go to hell forever. Does that sound logical to you?Of course not. Im not disagreeing with you here that those statements are illogical. But from my understandings and study to reject the message is a much much deeper concept than simply disbelieving in God. Anyways hope youre well.  Peace and have a good day. ,islam,d7g0gw5,1,t5_2qhbp

8911746,0,t3_52b83g,The whole point of monotheism is belief that theres something larger more powerful and beyond the scope of human comprehension. Asking the question why is there so much suffering in the world if there is a god ignores all of that. Its placing human comprehension and perception at the forefront of monotheism when thats not what monotheism is at all. Conversely id ask how can some people go through so much pain and suffering yet still maintain personal peace and wellbeing ? At the end of it all a persons suffering is subjective its theirs to bear and its not yours to objectifyquantify. Any philosophy course will peel apart your question and force you to first define what pain and suffering even is perceived as what mercy is perceived as what God is perceived as. And these questions are never answered concretely pointing out the limits of human comprehension and perception. And then people are left to believe there must be something more complex and greater than human perception something limitless beyond our scope. Its like when you have a dream and youre trapped in the state of consciousness where you perceive it as real and you have no idea its all a dream. You wake up and realize the dream is not what you previously thought it was while dreaming your consciousness shifted and now the emotionsreality of your dream are perceived differently. So what if your perception of real life pain and suffering is skewed and your own consciousness is what is causing you issue not the concept of monotheism itself ? This is longwinded but im trying to exemplify the complexity of monotheism philosophy and human perception where questions like this have no simple answer but they really hold no weight in arguing against monotheism or mercy in general. A person can go through ten times the amount of pain youve gone through yet still not question the existence of something literally larger than life not everyone is held to the same perception you are and they therefore dont see it the way you do in which case youre holding a possible God to the standards you have for humanity. But thats illogical because applying human personal standards onto the definition of a God nulls the definition completely. ,islam,d7j287a,11,t5_2qhbp

8933353,0,t1_d7lmckb,gt The brothers of muhamed seems awkward and dont think a group would take that name. It also depends on which Muhamed you mean. If you mean the prophet then that wont work but if you mean a scholar or their particular leader then thats more plausible but still weird.gt And ikhwan still has an impression of being related to the Muslim brotherhood which many groups would try to avoid such a comparison. Not sure what type of extreme group you have in mind and what their ideology is but if theyre salafi then there is a big chance they would hate the Muslim Brotherhood on political and religious grounds.Great observations! These kinds of insider details and observations are what I came here for so thank you for that!gt It also depends on the timeline for example what happened to yemen or jordon. If yemen is a saudi puppet state then they could easily mount a resistance from there or at least bring yemen into a war with the nascent regime in saudi territory.Ooh... now theres an interesting idea! I like it something like this would be a great tension builder for the story.gt The position of western countries is important because they would be the ones defending any country that takes the saudis in or gets into a fight with the extremist group.The world I envision in this timeline has the Arab League having closer and friendlier relations with the West and increased cooperation which serves as one of the reasons for the Saudi overthrow. So Western nations would be very concerned and involved in this crisis.gt Sudan and Pakistan would accept that if major changes didnt happen in those societies.I also envision a Pakistan which is more friendly to the new Saudi government than it is to the former monarchy. Pakistan eventually becomes an ally to the new regime but Im not sure what their stance would be at the beginning. Sudan as part of the Arab League would still remain a possibility.gt It all depends on what this group wants and what their ideology is. What do they plan as a foreign policy and what do they say as propaganda? For example the gulf monarchies were enthusiastic about the iranian revolution at first until Khomeini started preaching about overthrowing them and exporting his revolution. So propaganda and agendas matter in how regimes would react to such a coup.They want a hardline ultraconservative Islamic caliphate similar to what IS wants currently but they dont want to commit random attacks in random places like IS does. Rather they want to carry themselves more statesmanlike and be viewed as a legitimate country. They will however be tough on foreign policy and very hawkish. Once the new Saudi regime acquires nuclear weapons there are instantly fears that they will use them.gt And ofcourse does the coup involve massacres or large amount of death on social media like egypt? That could change perception too.Not particularly. There is a bit of collateral as is to be expected in a coup but it involves a number of highranking officials in the government and military with access to the heads of state and the Royal Family which allows them to attack directly and swiftly. Id say perhaps a few dozen civilian casualties in the entire ordeal whereas Egypt had multiple hundreds.gt Other governments would support even people they disagree with or hate for geopolitical gain but the group needs to at least pretend to be moderate and not support terrorism and especially not support subversive activities in friendly countries.They would not support terrorism and would not directly try to subvert friendly countries. They may however accept help from the intelligence services or Iran or Pakistan to help them meet their goals in exchange for favours.gt Its possible they could ban people non supportive of their ideology. Many groups have sacked the city before so they might even destroy the kaaba depending on how extreme their theology is.Wow! I dont think theyre that extreme. I do think a military occupation of the city is possible though.gt Good luck on your writing.Thank you!

9104944,0,t3_54zdqx,Islam teaches that many human societies received revelation by prophets from amongst themselves and in their own languages. Those who didnt receive one would have a special dispensation at the end of days.We dont really know which history figures or societies received what. Some have speculated some religious figure like Zoroaster or budha might have been prophets but no one really knows for sure. The islamic conception of these revelations is that they were largely rejected or altered beyond recognition in a few generations with hints of polytheism creeping in to various degrees. Muslims point to an apparent underlying emphasis in different polytheistic religions on the oneness of truth or the divine that manifests in multiple ways.We know muhamed was the last prophet. Jesus was the one just before him sent to the Israelites. The other prophets we know by name are usually arab Israelite or universal from the first generations or abraham and his sons.Most muslims would answer that we havent been told why the only ones mentioned are concentrated in this geographical location despite the hints and clear statements that indicate the existence of prophetic traditions in other societies. Thats the most Orthodox opinion to not speculate on which you dont know. Other muslims would try to find an explanation for this whilst acknowledging the shortcomings of such answers. Some would say god didnt need to specify other prophets because all the teachings he wanted to reveal only required the arab or Israelite prophets. Others would say that god only mentions familiar characters so as to not confuse the people who are in need of guidance and not a history lesson. Others would say that god specified the known figures by the audience and just the others without names. Plenty of stories in the quran dont have names attached to them. Others would say that the hadiths might indicate the presumed identity of certain prophets. There are hadiths that have stories without names. Some have speculated that one figure sounds like budha if I remember correctly. My personal ideas are that god wanted to test the stubborn nation of Israel and concentrated prophets for them to make a dent on world history so as to ingrain at least the doctrine of monotheism. And after their final prophet was about to be killed god brought his final complete religion in a new people with a new language so as to not bring the confusions that creeped into the first written traditions into the final one. This nation was the cousins of the Israelites and thus a lesson from god is derived from the loss of favor the disobedient suffers and the blessings bestowed on the righteous. ,islam,d869nxk,2,t5_2qhbp

Theres no reason to consider this incompatible unless one is subscribing to the Salafi view that posits that Allah is a limited being who is confined to a certain space on top of the universe sitting on His throne.  In that case you would say that Allah is dependent on space at least for His existence which would therefore have to be an uncreated eternal partner with Him.

Islam may enjoin or forbid something and the people  or most of them  may not be able to see the wisdom behind this command or prohibition. In that case we are obliged to obey the command or heed the prohibition and to have certain faith that the laws of Allaah are all good even if we cannot see the wisdom behind them. Circumcision is one of the Sunnahs of the fitrah as is indicated by the words of the Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him The fitrah is five things  or five things are part of the fitrah  circumcision shaving the pubes plucking the armpit hairs cutting the nails and trimming the moustache. narrated by alBukhaari  and Muslim . Undoubtedly with regard to the Sunnahs of the fitrah some of the wisdom behind them is obvious and that includes circumcision. There are clear benefits to it which we should pay attention to and understand the wisdom behind it. In the answer to question no.  we have discussed circumcision how it is to be done and the ruling on it. In the answer to question no.  we have explained the health and shari benefits of circumcision for males. Circumcision is prescribed for both males and females. The correct view is that circumcision is obligatory for males and that it is one of the symbols of Islam and that circumcision of women is mustahabb but not obligatory. There are reports in the Sunnah which indicate that circumcision for women is prescribed in Islam. In Madeenah there was a woman who circumcised women and the Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him said to her Do not go to the extreme in cutting that is better for the woman and more liked by the husband.  Narrated by Abu Dawood  classed as saheeh by Shaykh alAlbaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. Female circumcision has not been prescribed for no reason rather there is wisdom behind it and it brings many benefits. Mentioning some of these benefits Dr. Haamid alGhawaabi says The secretions of the labia minora accumulate in uncircumcised women and turn rancid so they develop an unpleasant odour which may lead to infections of the vagina or urethra. I have seen many cases of sickness caused by the lack of circumcision. Circumcision reduces excessive sensitivity of the clitoris which may cause it to increase in size to  centimeters when aroused which is very annoying to the husband especially at the time of intercourse. Another benefit of circumcision is that it prevents stimulation of the clitoris which makes it grow large in such a manner that it causes pain. Circumcision prevents spasms of the clitoris which are a kind of inflammation.  Circumcision reduces excessive sexual desire. Then Dr alGhawaabi refutes those who claim that female circumcision leads to frigidity by noting Frigidity has many causes and this claim is not based on any sound statistics comparing circumcised women with uncircumcised women except in the case of Pharaonic circumcision which is where the clitoris is excised completely. This does in fact lead to frigidity but it is contrary to the kind of circumcision enjoined by the Prophet of mercy peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him when he said Do not destroy i.e. do not uproot or excise. This alone is evidence that speaks for itself because medicine at that time knew very little about this sensitive organ the clitoris and its nerves. From Liwa alIslam magazine issue  and  article entitled Khitaan alBanaat circumcision of girls. The female gynaecologist Sitt alBanaat Khaalid says in an article entitled Khitaan alBanaat Ruyah Sihhiyyah Female circumcision from a health point of view For us in the Muslim world female circumcision is above all else obedience to Islam which means acting in accordance with the fitrah and following the Sunnah which encourages it. We all know the dimensions of Islam and that everything in it must be good in all aspects including health aspects. If the benefits are not apparent now they will become known in the future as has happened with regard to male circumcision  the world now knows its benefits and it has become widespread among all nations despite the opposition of some groups. Then she mentioned some of the health benefits of female circumcision and said It takes away excessive libido from womenIt prevents unpleasant odours which result from foul secretions beneath the prepuce.It reduces the incidence of urinary tract infectionsIt reduces the incidence of infections of the reproductive system. In the book on Traditions that affect the health of women and children which was published by the World Health Organization in  it says With regard to the type of female circumcision which involves removal of the prepuce of the clitoris which is similar to male circumcision no harmful health effects have been noted.

I would be pleasantly surprised if this was not true.gtWhat should Israelis do when people invade their homes and kill family?They should recognize that their recent relativesmaybe themselves many Israelis are first generation immigrants who made aliyah as they like to call it are illegal invaders to Muslim territory and then should pay reparations to Palestinians and turn their country into a single state called Palestine where everyone has equal rights.But that will never happen for a multitude of reasons not all of which are the fault of Israelis but most are. For example I doubt Palestinians would give Israelis equal rights if they became a majority in a single state. And Im sure wed see lots of sectarian violence due to the sheer amount of revenge the Palestinians would want.But ultimately just remember that its your fault that so many Palestinians are pissed. Youre the ones who invaded your country. I think David BenGurion or whatever his name was said the same thing as I am right now that the Palestinians are rightfully pissed you stole their land.Doesnt matter if the Jewish ethnicity populated the geography  years ago they themselves were invaders at that point anyway  just like the Palestinians were  years ago.I guess Israel will exist until the next invader rolls around probably when the Muslim world reunites.

And while the Sheikhs position is understandable and qualified its not a beallendall. I think he needs to be more aware of the potential consequences of his words being misinterpreted and misused as a foundation for more unreasonable claims like the comments you pointed out. He definitely should have emphasized the implicit importance of vaccines more than the what to not do caveat  because while logical people would already be aware of the former they are not the ones most at risk in the first place. It is imperative for scholars to keep this in mind as they utilize their platform especially when ones audience is on many different levels of comprehension.At the end of the day its the sum of a general lack of education and the human tendency to seek confirmation bias as with a lot of issues nowadays.In regards to Islam...

9406288,0,t3_59gb7n,Dunno how helpful youll find this but I would tell you to read the biography of the Prophet and decide for yourself. There are only two possibilities on his claims of being a messenger of God. Either he was telling the truth or he was wrong. If it was the former then he was either delusional or he was right. See for yourself whether his behaviour was consistent with delusions. Delusional people cannot function for long in society even today and back in those times they certainly didnt have any chance of becoming great statesmen military commanders lawgivers loving fathershusband and a lot more. If the evidence is against the delusion theory then you would have no choice but to accept that he was telling the truth and indeed was a Messenger of God.

9421413,0,t1_d9a64r2,gt it means that as they are in the throws of death i.e. their soul is about to be taken away then they will be given the realization of the truth of Jesus.  This isnt falsifiable since nobody is actually coming back from actual full and complete death to tell us otherwise.So like the Pharaoh believing in the God of Mosesa while drowning? Hmm... That is still falsifiable unless you mean some esoteric dawning of the truth on Jews and Christians which clearly defies the example of Pharaoh we have. And the idea that each Jew and Christian would be believing in the moment of death like Pharaoh easily falsifiable or some hidden unfalsifiable esoteric manner is ridiculous in itself. Why even would the truth about Jesusa dawn to them in their moment of death? For the Pharaoh we can see that he knew inside that the God of Mosesa was true but he didnt accept because of his arrogance and pride. And hence when drowning and desperate he believed. Each Jew or Christian isnt secretly a Muslim whod declare his belief when dying and desperate when it is too late.So the bottomline is still that either they believe like the Pharaoh which is false in two ways first it is easily falsifiable with what happens in reality and second they arent all hypocrites hiding the truth their entire lives. Or it is some secret dawning of truth which noone else knows about.If we examine that esoteric dawning of truth we encounter even more serious problems. Does God reveal to them knowledge about Jesusa? Does that make all of them a Nabi? Does God dawn the truth on heretical Islamic sects like the Ahmadiyya?OK so maybe God doesnt reveal that to them and make them all Nabis. It might just be selfrealisation. Does the mere sight of angels of death make them realise that the Islamic concept of Jesusa is right though they never knew the Islamic version of angels of death Jesusa etc.?I can see how an informed about Islam Christian or Jew might actually believe in the moment of death after seeing the angels but... the verse is very absolute. It really makes it clear that each and every Jew andor Christian will believe. The logistics dont work out. God cannot reveal it to them and most of them cannot selfrealise. So we have a dead end.,islam,d9a89a8,1,t5_2qhbp

Being a Muslim doesnt require you to wear a special badge or to change your name and announce it to everyone.  Nor do you have to tell everyone why their theology is wrong and why yours is right.  Its fine to keep it to yourself particularly if youre in a situation where doing so could put you into some jeopardy.On the outside  especially if youre a guy  theres really very little to distinguish a Muslim from a nonMuslim even with the latter keeping beards is fashionable nowadays....  The key difference is in what you believe in your heart and from the sounds of it youre already there.   Try as you might to lie to yourself and others you can never lie to God Hell always know whats in your heart.  So from what youre saying its not whether you should be a Muslim or not youre already one.  Its a matter of how that will reflect in your life in terms of your actions.As to marriage and children one thing at a time.  And remember you wont be marrying your blood relatives anyway so what say do they have over how your family life anyway and how you raise your kids?While of course you would know your own situation better I do suspect you might be imagining the situation to be much worse than it really is.  If you live in the US you really dont have to worry about being in danger as a Muslim that your life would be under threat and all that.

9484359,0,t1_d9hdvul,gt Albani judged Saheeh hadiths as weak OMG you have zero knowledge regarding how the sheikh performed his research. Alright heres your answerThe fairminded researcher into criticisms levelled at asSaheehayn the two Saheehs  of alBukhaari and Muslim has to differentiate between two types of criticism The proper type of criticism is methodological criticism based on evidence and proof that carry weight according to the scholars of Islam and are appropriate to the study of the Prophetic Sunnah as one of the branches of historical knowledge so as to combine the critiques of both the isnaad chain of narrators and matn text. They do not reject the rules of the muhadditheen hadith scholars in favour of ideas based on whims and desires and they do not use the language of doubt and alarm to undermine the status of asSaheehayn in the ummah. Rather this methodology recognises the status of these two books maintains their honourable position and acknowledges the great efforts that were put into them. This methodology was followed by many of the earlier and later scholars such as Abu Zarah d.  AH Abu Dawood d.  AH Abu Haatim d.  AH atTirmidhi d.  AH anNasaai d.  AH adDaaraqutni d.  AH alBayhaqi d.  AH Ibn Taymiyah d.  AH and Ibn Hajar d.  AH. In each case you will find that their criticism has to do with a very small number of hadiths that appear in asSaheehayn either before or after these books were written and is based on academic fairminded methodological research. In fact some of the hadiths in Saheeh Muslim were not accepted by alBukhaari himself and some of the hadiths in Saheeh alBukhaari were not accepted by Imam Muslim himself. We are not here to judge between the two shaykhs alBukhaari and Muslim on the one hand and those scholars muhadditheen and others. Rather the point here is to contrast the methodology of these scholars who should not be objected to on the basis that there is consensus on the soundness of everything in asSaheehayn with the methodology of those who strive to undermine the status of these two books and to lower the esteem in which they are held by people.The method of the muhadditheen that is based on sound rules is distinguished from other methods that criticise asSaheehayn by the following characteristics  Soundness of motive and neutrality for criticism Following the rules of hadith science Preserving the content of the text as is for other reasons either because the criticism is originally directed at some of the isnaads and not the matn text or because the content of the hadith is already being practised on the basis of reasons such as accepting mursal reports giving the ruling of marfoo to mawqoof reports accepting the hadith of someone whose character or situation is unknown etc.  Taking differences in stride and not over exaggerating the impact thereof and stating ones view on the basis of probability by using gentle and appropriate words such as saying this is more likely to be the case this is more sound  and so on. Not criticising a great deal because when the critic follows the guidelines on the process of criticism that leaves less room for manoeuvre so he will not dare to criticise except in cases where he has clear proof and his evidence is confirmed. Hence the hadiths that were subject to sound criticism  those that were left after eliminating the types of hadith mentioned at the beginning of this discussion namely those that were unfairly criticised  will be very few. AlHaafiz described them as being very few at the time when according to some confused contemporary critics they number in the hundreds to the point that some of them were listed in a separate book entitled Daeef Saheeh alBukhaari.Research paper alManhajiyyah alMundabitah lada anNuqaad alMutaqaddimeena fi Taleel badi Ahaadeeth asSaheehayn p. which was submitted to the conference alIntisaar lisSaheehayn Defending asSaheehayn at the University of Jordan. Anyone who reflects on these five characteristics and contemplates the difference between the two methods then reads with an open mind the research of Shaykh alAlbaani may Allah have mercy on him in which he critiqued some of the hadiths of asSaheehayn will realise that the shaykh may Allah have mercy on him followed the disciplined method that has clear guidelines following in the footsteps of previous muhadditheen in critiquing some of the reports in asSaheehayn. He will understand that this type of criticism is not casting aspersions upon the Sunnah and is not contrary to scholarly consensus rather it is a continuation of previous wellknown efforts in critiquing asSaheehayn but that is done within the framework of sound principles of debate and criticism adhering to the characteristics or guidelines mentioned above among the most important of which are following the rules of hadith science and maintaining respect for asSaheehayn in peoples hearts.Shaykh alAlbaani said I find myself compelled by academic honesty to express what I believe is correct and to discharge my duty as the researcher who has deep knowledge cannot but admit an academic fact which was expressed by Imam ashShaafai may Allah have mercy on him as it was narrated that he saidAllah has decreed that no book should be perfect except His Book therefore some of the scholars objected to some words that were erroneously inserted by some of the narrators in some saheeh hadiths some of which we will mention here by way of example Hadith  about the leper the bald man and the blind man  in which it says it occurred to Allah instead of the correct phrase Allah willed because speaking in terms of something occurring to Allah may He be exalted is not appropriate how could that be acceptable when it is one of the beliefs of the Jews? The phrase one who compromises instead of one who adheres to in the words of the Prophet blessings and peace of Allah be upon him The likeness of the one who adheres to the limits set by Allah and the one who transgresses them Hadith no. . Hadith about the plague  Do not leave except fleeing from it. The narrators addition of the word except is an obvious error so the hadith should read Do not leave fleeing from it. Hadith no.  gtThe two parties to a transaction have the option of proceeding or cancelling He may confirm agreement three times.  AlHaafiz   stated that the phrase that mentions confirming it three times cannot be proven to be from the Prophet blessings and peace of Allah be upon him. He said p.  concerning hadith no.  about the words concerning the righteous slave By the One in Whose hand is my soul were it not for jihad that this remark has been inserted into the hadith these are not the words of the Prophet blessings and peace of Allah be upon him rather these are the words of Abu Hurayrah. So this is like the hadith mentioned above in Vol.  no.  in which the narrator added at the end So whoever can extend his traces of wudoo on his face let him do so. This has also been inserted. With regard to hadith no.  alIsmaaeeli highlighted that it has an interrupted isnaad. AlHaafiz approved of the hadith but had some reservations about the text which he mentioned in alFath.A similar example is the hadith mentioned above   Jaza asSayd gtIt was narrated from Ibn Abbaas that the Prophet blessings and peace of Allah be upon him married Maymoonah when he was in ihram. The more correct view is that he blessings and peace of Allah be upon him married her when he was not in ihram. Similarly in hadith no.  it says gtAllah says There are three whose opponent I will be on the Day of Resurrection.  Its isnaad includes a narrator who was the subject of a difference of opinion. What is established is that he had a poor memory. AlBukhaari himself indicated that the report of the one who narrated this hadith from him was not sound. You may see his comments there so that you may be prudent with regard to matters of your religion and the hadiths of your Prophet. Sheikh Al Albaani may Allah have mercy on him said gtSome young people who are fanatically devoted to Saheeh alBukhaari and likewise to Saheeh Muslim are ignorant and adamantly insist that everything in them is saheeh. In contrast to them some writers have no respect at all for asSaheehayn and they reject of their hadiths any that are not in accordance with their rational thinking and their whims and desires such as asSaqqaaf and other writers. I have responded to both groups in more than one place. Silsilat alAhaadeeth asSaheehah He may Allah have mercy on him also said gtImam alBukhaari and Imam Muslim did their duty of selecting these hadiths that they included in asSaheehayn from among hundreds of thousands of hadiths which was an immense effort. Therefore it does no service to knowledge and it is not wise at all for me to focus my efforts on examining asSaheehayn and ignore the hadiths to be found in the four Sunans and elsewhere which are not known whether they are saheeh or daeef. But during my academic research I came across some hadiths in asSaheehayn or in one of the two and realised that there are some hadiths that are daeef! But whoever has doubts about my ruling concerning some hadiths let him refer to Fath alBaari where he will find very many things that the author alHaafiz Ahmad ibn Hajar alAsqallaani critiquedSo the next time you criticize the Sheikh I suggest you criticize your lack of knowledge regarding this first. Because your type of ignorant criticisms only help iblees spread fitnah amongst us.,islam,d9i5g5t,0,t5_2qhbp

This is also fine just not how most Muslims usually understand the role of Muhammad in Islam.Muhammads pbuh religious opinions and commands are viewed as infallible by Muslims. His advice on other things such as military matters is viewed as very important since he was clearly a genius and had a stellar mind but they are not considered infallible or imperative to obey. You dont see Muslims digging giant trenches around every single one of their historic battles for this reason.Muhammad pbuh himself consulted his companions a lot on worldly matters including to the surprise of his contemporaries a lot of women like his wife Khadijah RA and many others. gtbut if shes in a city then the guy is suddenly a childrapist?Consent is also a culturally relative and malleable issue. ,islam,da4w2jf,1,t5_2qhbp

It is reported that alMamoon asked Imam Ali Reza as once to explain some Quranic verses out of his curiosity about the knowledge God bestowed upon the Imam regarding their meanings. Among such verses was He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and His throne was over the waters that He might try you which of you is best in conduct.He said The Praised and Exalted God created the Throne the water and the angels before the creation of heavens and earth and the angels used to know God through their own creation through the Throne and the water. Then He made His Throne over the water in order to manifest His might to the angels so that they might know that He is capable of doing whatever He pleased. Then He raised the Throne through His might moved it and made it above the seven heavens. Then He created the heavens and the earth in six days while He was omniPotent on His Throne. He was capable of creating them in a twinkle of the eye but the Exalted One created them in six days in order to show the angels what He was creating one after the other so that they would know time and again that God was the Originator of each and every thing. God did not create the Throne because He was in need for it since He is independent of the Throne and of everything He created He cannot be described by anything in the cosmos simply because He has no physical body Exalted He is above the characteristics of what He created a great deal of ExaltationExegesis of Imam alReza,islam,da9stw4,1,t5_2qhbp

9833198,0,t1_dao7whh,The evidence for execution being the punishment of the murtad is quite overwhelming.  However the issue that is somewhat up in the air is the duration of seeking their repentance.  Its generally agreed save by the Shia in regards to the bornMuslim who apostates so far as I know that prior to the hadd being implemented against such a person their repentance is to be sought.  If they repent the hadd is dropped if they dont they are killed via the hadd.  The question is though how long is their repentance to be sought for?  Three days?  A month?  Or forever?  Favoring the latter view would be Sufyan alThawri as well as Ibrahim from whom he narrates this view                   .Musannaf Abd alRazzaq From alThawri from Amr b. Qays from Ibrahim.  He said regarding the apostate His repentance is sought forever.  Suyfan said This is what we go by.                                    .Musannaf Abd alRazzaq From alThawri from Hammad from Ibrahim.  It would be said Avert the hutus from he Muslims as much as you are able to so if you find a way out for the Muslim then avert the hadd from him for a hakim from the hukkam erring in pardoning the Muslims is better than him erring in punishment.Some people think that Sufyan was against execution being the punishment of the apostate but this would appear to be incorrect as he himself narrates reports that confirm it.  But in practice he appears to have favored perpetually delaying its implementation as one continues to seek the repentance of the one who has left Islam in the hope of their returning to it the latter of course being better should it occur than having them die as an unbeliever.,islam,dapad67,0,t5_2qhbp

Because there are a lot of alcohol made out of plants like beer beer existed even before the prophet pbuh and it is beer that saved europe so could we say beer is haram if it saved a continent existed before the prophet pbuh and no hadith talk about even if it contains alcohol.

SourcegtCertainly celebrating your birthday and proclaiming yourself a God would be problematic. If you simply celebrate that God has blessed you with a year of life and all the other many blessings that you have been given throughout the past year how could that be wrong?gtThere is a known tie to cakescandles for a Birthday and Paganism. That is certain. The concept of being thankful for a year of life and being happy after a year has passed in your journey in the Dunya is not pagan.This act of birthday celebration was an action we find that was a common practice of Pharoah and the Pagans. The action of celebrating birthdays was established and continued by them. Allahswt and the Prophetsaw through his Sunnah showed us the best examples of how to celebrate and be grateful for the blessings Allahswt has given us. If you would spend time reading the Quran over your old books youd seeSurah AlAhqafgt We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents In pain did his mother bear him and in pain did she give him birth. The carrying of the child to his weaning is a period of thirty months. At length when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years he says O my Lord! Grant me that I may be grateful for Thy favour which Thou has bestowed upon me and upon both my parents and that I may work righteousness such as Thou mayest approve and be gracious to me in my issue. Truly have I turned to Thee and truly do I bow to Thee in Islam.In addition the Prophetsaw has also taught us gtThe Messenger of Allah  took hold of my hand and said O Muadh! By Allah I love you so I advise you to never forget to recite after every prayer  Allahumma ainni ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni ibadatika O Allah help me remember You to be grateful to You and to worship You in an excellent manner. SourceThe Prophetsaw said after every prayer therefore a person who truly wants to be grateful and celebrate the mercy and blessings of Allahswt would do it  times a day after every Fardh Salah.Therefore the question for you uBartBar Do you prefer continuing the customs and practices established by Pharaoh and the Pagans over those given to us by Allahswt and the Prophetsaw?

10313704,0,t3_5noc0c,The main difference between Islam and Judaism is a matter of universality. Whereas both religions are monotheistic and reject the trinity for example Judaism has historically been an ethnicitybased religion. True salvation is thus only available for people who believe in the oneness of God and are also ethnically Hebrews some modern reform Jewish communities have abandoned this belief but it is the classical understanding among Jews. In Islam eternal salvation is available to anyone who believes in the oneness of God and accepts Muhammad as His final messenger. Furthermore whereas Judaism rejects Jesus and Muhammad Muslims believe they are both prophets of God.Why should anyone believe Muhammad? Muslims believe that he was not just a pious teacher but a messenger of God who directly received revelation from Him. He was chosen as the vessel through which God revealed His word the Quran to mankind and as a imitable example for mankind. Youll find some overlap between Christianity and Islam particularly with regards to moral conduct. The ten commandments are found in Islam in one form or another for example.

I wanted to get married and went with the cultural route of having parents find me someone because I didnt have anyone in my social circle to marry. but never realized how my own parents would betray me so they can find someone thatll be good for them only.gtI never did the harams that make a bad muslim bad so I thought Allah had my back given how supposedly good people are rewarded.As others have said here being righteous doesnt mean that youll have an easy life. It only means that youll have peace at heart and have the capability to overcome all types of problems. gtDo the people think that they will be left to say We believe and they will not be tried? Surah Ankaboot verse Furthermore Im sure your parents did not betray you rather they didnt look into the relationship as deeply as they could have or she potentially hid her flaws all too well. Even if you went down the haraam route theres always a potential that people change after marriage. Ive seen it happen hundreds of times. gtMy reward has been a spouse who I have nothing in common with and isnt attractive. She hid a lot of her imperfections in the pictures because I couldnt meet her before nikah whereas I sent ugly pictures of myself so they dont think I lied about what I looked like. Worst of all they noticed something was off and asked my mom if she had my approval to which she had said yes without telling me.gtFrom alMugheerah ibn Shubah I proposed marriage to a woman and the Messenger of Allaah peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him said Have you seen her? I said No. He said Look at her because it is more fitting that love and compatibility be established between you. According to another report So he did that and he married her and mentioned that they got along. Reported by alDaaraqutni    Ibn Maajah Do not blame the religion for something you could have done. You were allowed to go and see her but you chose not to. Youre allowed to go and meet her as many times as you wish as long as things didnt get physical. Now to blame your issues on Allah because you acted irresponsibly is not fair to Allah or to you.gtIm miserable and dont know what to do. I dont love this woman and feel stuck. I purposely stopped praying because of the anger and rage that has no outlet. I am angry at my parents for doing this to a son that never gave them a hard time while my drinking cousins have amazing spouses lined up by their sincere parents. I cant enjoy anything in life because im constantly imagining myself with other people but im so religiously conditioned that I cant bring myself to commit any zina or start an affair. I just cant let this marriage rob me of my personality.Divorce isnt haraam bro. In fact many big named sahabis have gotten divorced. Dont you think they deserved model wives. In fact even Prophets have done divorces and youre aware of the wife of Lut AS. So dont act like just because youre righteous youll get everything in life. Youll gain strength to overcome any and all challenges but you have to trust in Allah as the challenges come through. Do what uhqq has said and make istikharah about things. Im not saying directly resort to divorce but see if you can work things out with this girl. If you still cant then the last option is divorce. Dont be angry with Allah rather turn to him and ask him to give you patience through this time of difficulty. Allah owes you nothing and we owe Allah everything.

10604811,0,t3_5rj0kc,I think we are Muslims should stand up and support rights that seem contradictory to Islamic values such as gay marriage in regions where it is prohibited by the government. Here are my reasons I do not believe the government should restrict rights in citizens that do not propose a threat to others. We as humans have been given the ability to make our own decisions by God and i dont think government should restrict these decisions. I also do not believe Hijab bans  requirements should exist and that Muslim women should decide for themselves whether to follow an obligatory part of the religion or not.  political recognition of gay marriage is secular and does not in my opinion encourage sin. People who can not marry today will continue to cohabitate and engage in sin privately perhaps even more since there is less motivation to stay with a single partner. The only thing that would change is that a group of people would make their potentially secret sin more well know. As i addressed in point  I think people have a choice given by God to make that decision. I may be wrong about this especially considering they are new ideas of mine and Allah knows best.  ,islam,dd9t07l,3,t5_2qhbp

The more you cover the more your mind and soul are foregrounded.gtWomen arent candy that need to be wrapped up and protected from or saved for the male gaze.Youre looking at this the wrong way the correct way to put it would be Indeed women arent candy but men have the natural disposition to view women as merely that.

People believed that the plague was Gods punishment for the sins of humanity and some people would walk from town to town and publicly whip themselves and each other. They hoped that this would make God forgive them. It didnt work of course and they actually often brought the plague with them where they went. Many Christian saints also whipped burned starved or otherwise harmed themselves.

10975358,0,t3_5wpo78,Islam is ease because everything thats a restriction for us has wisdom in it. Were told to restrict what we consume with our mouths eyes and ears because if we consume toxic things they damage us in different ways  physically or spiritually. By staying within what Allah has allowed for us were keeping our selves and souls healthy and thats better for us. That said though its not that every single second of our time has to be spent physically praying and worshipping. Thats where the whole Islam is a way of life not just a religion thing comes in. Everything we do can be an act of worship if done with the correct intention  if youre hanging out with your friends but youve scheduled it so youre not missing prayers thats worship in itself. When you stop yourself or others from backbiting. When you spend time with family thats worship. You can have hobbies and interests you can spend time doing nothing its your frame of mind that matters. You dont have to feel that its a burden or a struggle for it to count  or find it fulfilling and rewarding every second either. I think this was something that was a minor epiphany for me. gtAbu Dharr reported that the Prophet Muhammad said Charity is prescribed for each descendant of Adam every day the sun rises.He was then asked From what do we give charity every day? The Prophet answered The doors of goodness are many enjoining good forbidding evil removing harm from the road listening to the deaf leading the blind guiding one to the object of his need hurrying with the strength of ones legs to one in sorrow who is asking for help and supporting the feeble with the strength of ones arms  all of these are charity prescribed for you.gtHe also said Your smile for your brother is charity.

Its simply the correct religion for Jews to follow. Only Jews are obligated to follow the laws of Torah. All peoples must worship the one God but there is no obligation in Torah for all peoples to become Jewish. The idea that there is only one right way for all people to worship God is foreign to Judaism. NonJewish prophets of the True God may have existed but thats outside the scope of Jewish inquiry.If a nonJew is a monotheist and supports Jews being Jewish then theyre totally kosher to come worship with us.

If a foreign prophet demands that we Jews stop keeping Shabbat and follow the Law in Torah that foreign prophet is false.But if there is a foreign prophet who preacher to another nation and they do not demand we cease being Jews?

11091351,0,t3_5yahua,Firstly major respect to you for converting. Honestly youre much higher in Allahs eyes than most of the muslims out there. Always remember that and dont give up. Self preservation is a big aspect in Islam. If you feel your life is threatened by praying or that you may lose your fathers financial support Id suggest that you pray late at night or pray whatever you can like when your father is out at the time of dhuhr or asr. Most of the other redditors who commented have the right idea. Allah will not punish you for delaying or missing your prayers since you need your fathers support to atleast finish school and university.DO NOT anger him and threaten your own life and comfort at home by ignoring his threat. Pray only when you KNOW its safe to do so like when he is out. Because he can just as easily wake up at  am and check on you and may see you praying. Your situation is not unusual however the normal rules do not apply. Allah is the Most Merciful and Just and I believe that he will not hold you accountable for prayers that you miss or delay due to the situation that He Himself put you in. If he did he would not be Just or Merciful. Remember He has a much greater love for you since you converted. Always remember this when things seem tough. ,islam,dep711b,2,t5_2qhbp

However some masjids do have areas where women can go while on their periods so ask and see!Other than that being unable to pray or fast doesnt mean you are unable to worship Allah SWT in other ways. Even when on youre period its recommended to sit on your prayer rug at prayer times and do dhikr tasbeeh etc.Theres a lot of misconceptions out there about what women are allowednot allowed to do on their periods but this is the gist of it. Women are not dirty during this time it is a blessing that Allah SWT has created our bodies to function in this way. Through this system that He has created we are able to bear children and have heaven placed under our feet. Allah SWT does not require us to pray or fast during this time not because He wants to distance Himself from us but because he knows how difficult it can be for us and does not want to burden us further.

How many civilians has Assad bombed? Also shes a Communist. It really doesnt take a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing from this one.Now oppression of any kind is bad. I dont think Shia should be persecuted or slaughtered in the streets at all. But the following needs to be acknowledged if our conversation is to be balanced A Shia scholars call Sunnis kuffar. This is well documented in their books. I have some pertinent quotes here  but there are plenty more to be found. B Shia political projects are currently celebrated covertly or overtly and supported by Westerners while Sunni political projects are endlessly maligned and demonized. A lot of this is due to Irans extremely clever foreign policy and Saudi Arabias relative ineptness along with a bunch of other factors such as the legitimization strategy of Iran being based on projecting Shia Islamist governments and protecting Shia minorities while Twelverizing them wherever possible see AbdulMalik alHouthi and his jaunt to study in Qom but the fact of the matter is that people with the power to do something about it care about dead Shia and nobody with the power to do anything really cares about dead Sunnis. Dead Sunnis are either a good thing or unfortunate collateral damage to many Western news outlets people and organizations. C Nonetheless a lot of Shia have legitimate grievances about how they have been treated by Sunni political powers. The converse must be likewise acknowledged. ,islam,dfvr7gm,2,t5_2qhbp

Those kind mutawas will make sure you get proper justice no matter whatgtIf she was guilty Alhamdulillah.If she was not then her haqq is with Allah to take on the day of judgement.You realize what youre doing is irrelevant because she was executed regardless of what you think. Capital punishment should always be reserved for heinous crimes and should be carried out when the guilt is convicted  without the shadow of a doubt. Thats what justice is. If there is even a shred of doubt over your claims on carrying out an act then you should be given a fair transparent trial to uphold your own claims. It could have been anybody in her place anyone close to us and the end result would still have been the same because there is no legal definition for the word sorcery in THEIR OWN LEGAL SYSTEM. You know we Muslims are out here crying everyday about justice in places where we see evil happening and we want to stop it. Yet we see all this happening everyday in our lives in Saudi Arabia yet not a single person concerns themselves to go out and do something about it. Its like the Saudi have convinced us that they can do no wrong. Here we are arguing NOT about whether or not its right to execute someone over an empty claim but we are arguing about whether or not her Haqq will be there on the day of judgement. If this injustice is being carried out in front of our eyes and we do nothing we are no different from the west or the rebels or ISIS. If we see injustice carried out in front of our eyes it IS OUR HAQQ to fight for their right to have justice. We Muslims believe that every man is equal and deserves to be treated with kindness and respect. We should not stand idly when one of them is executed by a fellow muslim and say oh Allah will take care of him. No Allah wants us to fight for his cause. He wants us to look after our brothers and sisters and not let them be run over by the corrupt and the powerful. This is the most corrupt form of execution out there. They can do whatever they want without any repercussions.

And if I am wronged then Id be glad as my recompense would be in the afterlife.See this is where your thinking is wrong. When you see injustice happen to see you dont accept it as a something that will be corrected in the afterlife. We need to stand up for ourselves. If you feel you are being wronged by your muslim brother SPEAK UP and STAND UP against it. We cannot sit in the back while our muslim brothers and sisters are being killed. We cannot sit back when our Muslim brothers and sisters are being driven out of their homes on empty claims and are paraded and executed on a laymans will. We need to not accept this as OK. We need to fight for justice. So the next time you see those filthy mutawas execute  someone because sorcery or start beating up our daughters in malls we need ,islam,dg0smk6,1,t5_2qhbp

First off you cited two statements both by UmarRA not by the Prophet Muhammadsaw. The opinion of a Sahabi no matter how great is not binding. It holds high regard and should be given weight but it may or may not lead to a definitive ruling. Secondly the reason why I cited the story is because the very person who narrates both the ahadith you cited Imam Malikra is the one who was eating meat everyday. One of the four great Imam and he narrated those two statements yet he still ate meat everyday. Now who understood the Sunnah better you or Imam Malikra? Who understood the reality of the statements he transmitted you or Imam Malikra?Im not trying to you should eat meat everyday nor that you shouldnt. Im simply saying that YOU drawing a LEGAL RULING eating too much meat is makruh is incorrect.
