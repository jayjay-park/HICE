And if I even mention one example immediately she starts crying saying I bring old stuff to hurt her or that it is my own fault that I dont let go. No responsibility.

They engage in addictive behaviour to bring about this state because its better to feel nothing than sad.

7130923,0,t3_4d6ywt,Omg.  Just omg. I totally get your story. Right now Im also  I am having to reevaluate EVERYTHING about my life.   My u BPD mom has tainted everything I know about relating to another human being but also my relationship with God. A little back story  Luckily my mom didnt become a Christian until I was moved out and in college so I wasnt raised on it but the crazy talk started immediately.  She was all in. A complete Jesus freak. We figured it would pass.  She would talk about Jesus and the Bible while we drank and smoked together.  And honestly as crazy as it all was  it didnt seem all bad.  She seemed to have found something positive for herself and I was happy for her.   Eventually she quit drinking too.  Which again another positive. Like I said I was off at college so I was experiencing my first taste of freedom from living with her but my little sister was wrapped up in all these radical changes. She was also receiving the full brunt of all of moms neediness her rages her incessant talking etc because I was gone and my dad was MIA as much as possible.  But mostly during this phase mom was so manic.  All she could talk about was Jesus and she was annoyingly excited. I was experiencing my own changes as well.   I too got sober.  I too became a Christian enmeshed much?.  I was still very young and it all made sense at the time.  I thought mom and I had found the answer to life. An epic epiphany.   Before we knew it  our family was segregated Christians vs heathens and sober vs degenerate drunks.  It has been that way until only recently.  My mom  in the last decade did a lot of what you talked about.  She would use our shared sobriety and spirituality as a window into the depth of my soul. She twisted scripture to use against me  she told my secrets in the name of prayer.  If I didnt call her often enough it meant I was isolating and on my way to relapse or falling away from the Lord.  My own beliefs have been manipulated and it is going to take a long time and a lot of questions to sort it out.  She plays the faithful loving and forgiving martyr to the max.  So  I have  yrs of brainwashing to undo.  I am coming out of the FOG and learning how to think for myself.  I know how hard this wasis for me  so my heart goes out to you  and you are not alone.  There are other selfrighteous Godobsessed BPD moms out there using Gods will as a disguise for their own delusional motives.  Also IMO you have not seenheard the last from your mom.   She may have disowned you  but I dont think shes done with you yet. Thank you so much for sharing.  Also I dont have any advice on what to dosay  either.  Im in the same boat.  I am VLC now  and will most likely be NC soon.  I am just focusing on whats best for me and unfortunately not talking to her or hearing her tell how unlovable I am is working the best.  ,raisedbyborderlines,d1opfq5,6,t5_33d8b

7203180,0,t3_4e4ep3,My mother is uBPD. She is very religious of the bornagain variety and she often has delusions that she is being directly spoken to by God. Or that a very bad storm that knocks down trees on our property during a tornado warning is actually angels and demons fighting over her soul or my dads soul I cant remember the specifics. That kind of insane preoccupation with her own perceived importance to the universe is not uncommon and extends also to everyday people and even complete strangers. It is my suspicion that powerful paranoia makes sense within the BPD spectrum if only because borderlines are so convinced the world and everyone in it revolves around them. I think this is only because they feel so intensely and bounce from one emotion to the next mindlessly. They both obsess about and feel threatened by their interactions with everyday people. For example if a stranger in the grocery store was ever frowning in my mothers direction or didnt return a smile she flashed at them she would later tell me privately in the car or sometimes in the next grocery aisle over that said stranger has personally wronged her by not returning her smile or that they were rude for not smiling back. She has never considered the idea that the stranger never  noticed her or was just in a really bad mood or didnt feel obligated to smile at a complete stranger. It seemed like my mother always felt like everything was about her. She really believed she impacted everyone around her and when they didnt notice her she noticed it and took offense. Its so weird to think about all of this from a more objective standpoint now that I have had a real chance to separate from her. She exhibits such strange and irrational behavior that is directly influenced by these self centered beliefs. These grandiose thoughts that her presence should always demand the reaction and acknowledgement of everyone in the vicinity is a real type of paranoid delusion. One that I believe I have anecdotal evidence to support. ,raisedbyborderlines,d1wxzz1,9,t5_33d8b

She has a house in Mexico to live in. She will not be homeless. Tell her to go there. Give her a deadline. Leave your own house if you need to. But tell her she has to go. And please if you havent yet find a good therapist to help you sort through all the terrible things that have happened to you so that you can begin to heal for yourself and for your wonderful husband and daughter. They deserve to have you at your best. Do it for them but do it for yourself first. You are worth it. My therapist taught me that the hardest part about healing is giving up the wish for a good mother. A mother should love her children protect them and support them. Not beat them and belittle them and endanger them. You would never imagine doing that to your child! But thats not the mother you had. So you have to give up that heartfelt wish. You need to become your own good mother. The good mother to the lost abused and terrified little girl that still lives inside you. With therapy you can do this. Its hard and it takes time but it works. Sounds like you were the bad split child. My sister was the bad split child and when her children were born they lived with my BPD mother also. She abused my sisters children. She violently shook the threeyearold boy and fed my infant niece spoiled formula for a week on purpose until she needed to be hospitalized. This woman bad split you she will see your daughter as an extension of you and abuse her as well. You need to get her out of your house for your daughters safety. And just so you know all that hatred that your mother felt for you was probably projection for the hatred that she felt for herself. It doesnt make it any better but just know that you and your behaviour basically had nothing to do with it. You were a wonderful child and because of her illness she missed out on realizing that. Im so sorry youre going through this. But right now you have to be a mama bear and fight for your family. Get her out now. You are not crazy. You are not wrong. You are not bad. You are strong.

You want THE answer to how do I go about this best in order to make my parent react healthily or at least moderately? The answer in my experience is that there is not a way. Thats because they have a personality disorder. You cant control how they act.

8128385,0,t3_4qd49o,So many of these already listed! I can think of a few. My mother styles herself as a Catholic Supermom. But she was always complaining about how much work it was taking care of so many kids. Except she didnt. She either sat at the kitchen table smoking cigarettes and talking on the phone for hours or playing video games all day. When she was angry about the mess she would blame us and the fact that God cursed her with so many kids.She would curse god screaming and swearing at god at least once a day for giving her such a shitty life but if anyone at church asked her to do something she was on it. Supermom thus couldnt be bothered with taking care of her children the ones that ruined her life and made her want to die. She didnt play with us and rarely engaged with us except to make us listen to her ranting. Strangely enough whenever it came time for her to help out financially she suddenly got pregnant again and had to stay home. Lord knows she couldnt hold down a job anyway. There was a while that she got really involved in the Right to Life Movement which was ironic since not only were we the poster family for what happens when people think they cant use birth control but she didnt want to be a mother. I suppose if she felt that she had to be cursed with progeny everyone did. Every election or major event for her movement us kids were warned to not bother her with anything because she was too busy. The worst part was that the yahoos she hung out with would tell us the same thing we were simply lucky to be alive after all she had more important things to do than you know be our mother. Motherhood was the greatest thing any woman could do except my mother. It all came to an end when two of her friends staged attacks on abortion clinics nearby. There was property damage and people got hurt. We all knew about it beforehand. She actually came up to me all giddy and told me about it beforehand laughing about it. But when the FBI investigated suddenly she knew nothing. We were all sat down and threatened with bodily injury and the horrors of foster homes  which apparently included being forced into prostitution and child pornography  if we told anyone about it. If someone came to the door we had to hide. If someone at school asked us we were to shut down and say nothing. Interestingly enough now that one of my siblings has become a foster parent foster homes are the greatest places EVAR!  EDIT for brevity. I tried. ,raisedbyborderlines,d4tpcku,3,t5_33d8b

Can you take any freelance work on the side? I write when I need a little more cash. As nonesuchuser said there is no winning. BPDs have an amazing knack for forgetting all the things they do and say and yet have a supposedly steeltrap memory for every single thing anyone in the world has ever done that bothered them in any way.

My mom also doesnt seem to realize that she does anything wrong or manipulative at all. The last time someone brought it up to her she was like a deer in the headlights.

8951463,0,t1_d7mtxs9,My dad pretty much said that I was the catalyst. He feels responsible for her and my brother but the way she was treating me was over the line for him. So Im pretty much being forgiving and working with him but also being aware and observant. Were kind of both trying to keep each other sane which helps to resist moms gaslighting and attempts to rewrite history. Which come to think of it is probably why she put so much effort into turning me against him so I wouldnt talk to him or believe him.Its so good to know that there are other people who have gone through this. I feel like Im going through the process of mourning my good mother. I do have a lot of nice memories of her which used to make me feel hopeful but now Im just kind of sad. It seems like such a waste when I think about the person she couldve been.But the fact is shes never going to change unless she wants to and shes never going to want to. Theres nothing I can do for her that wont cause harm to me and I refuse to sacrifice myself for someone who doesnt want to get better.

Most hospitals now have a team that manages cases if you meet with them you can work with them to outline what care they may help you set up for posthospital care. I like what KittenMommy said a lot  you need to find someone else to care for her. It cannot be you.

A BPD forum came up where pwBPD insist that of course they love! In fact they love more than everyone else and thats why theyre so hurt all the time! Which Ive heard plenty of times from my own uBPD mom.But OP keep in mind that love is not a feeling it is in action. In fact it is a series of actions built up over time that make your beloved feel safe and loved. Everything else the feelings the passion the rage  those are signs of infatuation not love.I also tear up when I think of the normal moments my mother and I shared when I believed we were reaching a new phase in our relationship one of true intimacy and closeness.

9117510,0,t3_555kpu,Actually this makes sense because pwBPD are often misdiagnosed or diagnose themselves as ASD. For women some with ASD are diagnosed BPD. And of COURSE you can be ASD with a BPD parent but she was only talking about social skills.But I think whoever was talking to you is really oversimplifying ASD and social skills. Therapy of any sorts working on social skills is very helpful for people with parents of BPD because we were conditioned to see and fear people with their perspective. Its something Im really trying to work on myself. I dont know how much she knows about ASD but a lot of people are armchair ASD experts nowadays and label everyone with it. I mean be straight up with your therapist if you want nothing to lose but especially off the socialization thing alone I think they are detecting your struggle but pushing somethingmaybe projecting something they dont understand. ,raisedbyborderlines,d87rzhi,5,t5_33d8b

9124391,0,t3_555llc,Wow. This resonates with me so much. So so so much. When I was     but  in particular I was a horrible person. Truly when I look back those years were the only years I had close friends I saw on a daily basis and I abused them. Several years later when I saw those people again I could not look them in the eye. Im not talking normal childhood Look I got a higher grade than you stuff Im talking total I had to make everyone around me inferior narcissistic traits.I cant go into all the things I said and I think I may have blocked out a lot but some memories that I hate myself for are When I was  in math class my friend and I were making paper air planes for an assignment. I dont know what the problem was but I looked her straight in the eyes and told her in a mean voice Whos been making paper airplanes longer than you? I have. One friend lost a competition and went into the bathroom to cry. Another one went into the bathroom with her to comfort her. When both of them came out I looked straight over the upset persons head and mouthed to the other person Is she okay? I mean it sounds normal but I was trying to be superior and be condescending and yeah. This ones less narcissistic than the other when I was  like I said I think the worse was when I was  I got into an argument with a teacher over the word veto. That was the best teacher I ever had she actually cared about me I wish Id opened up to her more. She was actually willing to hear my side and I managed to make about a  minute argument over the fact the the President couldnt really veto laws if he could be overruled by Congress. I understand now that I was mimicking the home behavior I had been taught. But honestly sometimes I hate younger me for the stuff she said. I viewed me as the only real person and viewed myself as entitled to friends and friendship as a one way thing.  But I am so so glad it was only a phase and I stopped those behaviors. Sometimes I wonder if I would have stopped if what happened to me later hadnt happened. When I was  I became ill with a chronic condition and saw many many doctors most of which I was verbally abused by. That turned me from arrogant abuser into small victim but not waif. And then I saw my parents side with the doctors and not stand up for me. One of the best examples of this is A doctor stared me in the eyes while I cried and told me I am your doctor not your friend mom watched the doctor say this to me while I cried and said nothing and took me back to that doctor because she was perscribing medication. And when I told dad how upset I was he just laughed and told me that was a classic line and kept laughing.And I realized I didnt want to be like them and I made those years just a phase but yeah. Thats probably way more information than anyone wanted but I hope you can make peace with the fact that you only mirrored the one person who was supposed to teach you how to act and you did what you had to.Edit mixed up ages,raisedbyborderlines,d88lpvj,1,t5_33d8b
9127263,0,t1_d88rtd8,gtYou were not a horrible person when you were a child.Thank you I needed to see this. I.... yeah I needed to hear this. gtNo no I cant say it emphatically enough NO. You were a child being abused and on top of not being taught the right way you were taught the wrong way to be. We all mimic what we are taught. At ?!?!? No. Maybe if you had said that at age  Id concede that you acted rudely but even that doesnt make you a horrible person.I think rude could have been used to describe those events. I think I feel the need to say horrible because mom called me rude all the time as a kid over very little things so what am I supposed to call myself over bigger things? One incident where I was rude was a Christmas we went to see her parents and of course I was verbally abused by them and wanted to go home and see my other abusive parent because I still freakin love them after the way theyve made me feel and I was asking mom when we could leave and she said in her meanest tone Why do you have to be so rude?. So yeah Im realizing my selfhatred runs as deep as some of the peoples on here and even though my parents didnt outright tell me I was evil they didare doing the same damage subtly. I guess she was just uptight that day because she was around her own abusive parents.gtAnd the things you described you just wanted to feel important in control in charge.Yes thats exactly why I did what I did kids love power and I loved it even more  because of my home life.gtAs if we were both looking for a way to feel good about ourselves and find our value since we didnt get that from our parent like others did.This so much. I never know what Ill get if I turn to mom maybe shell comfort me so Ill trust her maybe shell say Im over reacting maybe shell tell me I was a horrible child. Whatever she would tell me it would be for her own means and its not constant. So I tried to get that by controlling means as a kid and now Im trying to get that here.

There is an interesting lesson or at least an eerie familiarity that some might be recognizing in this exchange thats worth noting.Unfortunately having someone in our lives who reacts poorly to any grievance whether legitimate or not and response by publicly lashing out while also trying to hide their personal motives under the guise of the greater good is something that we are all VERY familiar with. This was not about the good of the community thats not the way healthy people behave when they do have such a concern.When you escalate immediately to this option of lashing out in public without confronting or discussing the issue with the person directly you are attempting to antagonize them with the shield of victimization and heroism. You cannot expect or demand legitimate dialogue from the person you are upset with and that is actually the whole point.

9489020,0,t1_d9gy3pd,hugsThank you. I think that most of my coping mechanisms are pretty functional if maybe annoying sarcasm and black humor and emo punk rock and all that jazz. Then theres the really really bad one which is selfharm. I was never a cutter and it was never a regular thing but I did bang my head on things learned that one from mommy dearest punch myself scratch my face. Im a little bit proud that I havent given in to the urge since I finally put the blame where it belongs on my mom. I crochet or listen to music instead. But probably the most insidious coping mechanism I have is invalidating my own feelings. I would do it all the time. Im just miserable because Im a teenager and dont have perspective so I think everythings the end of the world. Im just upset because Im PMSing. Im just mad because Im immature and selfcentered. And then Id hate myself for not being able to just dismiss the stupid unnecessary feelings and do what mom wanted. Ive been able to let go of almost everything else but for some reason I still have the urge to tell myself that Im just feeling this way because of blank and not because of any real reason. Granted I probably WAS a lot more emotional than usual because of hormones but that doesnt mean that I wasnt feeling what I was feeling!Im still kind of reeling from the realization that she never once actually saw me not as an actual person. Shed tell me point blank that I was her child and therefore an extension of her and always would be. I hate her for it now. I was so thoroughly brainwashed that when she told me that when I was a baby shed almost killed me and my brother before killing herself I took that as proof that she loved us.Now I know that its just proof that shes an arrogant selfish cunt who thinks she has the right to make lifealtering decisions for me because she gave birth. And thinks she deserves eternal worship because she gave birth like millions of women around the world dont do so every day in far worse conditions than she did.Im sorry this turned into a rant.

9701792,0,t3_5e0p80,My supervisor invited me to her churchs Thanksgiving dinner and she made special food for me since I have food allergies and told her that I might eat ahead of time and that I wanted her to know so I wouldnt be taken as rude for not eating food there I was floored she made the special food for me since that almost never happens in group food situations since I have such a restrictive diet. Anyway I didnt realize how many people would be there close to a thousand and I have agoraphobia and PTSD so... And I didnt realize how much singing and praying there would be either since Ive never really been to church so Im not familiar with these types of events. By the end of it I was visibly anxious because her family members all hugged me and kept doing the affection arm rub thing and I was struggling to breathe evenly.I didnt realize it would trigger me so much. Im still processing it. I think it triggered me because . Some of the religiosity in the event was a direct flashback to my abusive fathers words he grew up very religious but I was never taken to church thus I grew up in a toxic religiousish environment . Too many people . My supervisor being a momlike figure because she IS a mom and does that to everyone but I think my orphan self makes me appear to need a mom more . Im everything the church probably doesnt agree with gay polyamorous mentally ill oddballeccentric nonreligious and honest rather than that Southern thing of saying the opposite of what you really mean so it sounds passiveaggressive.

9908290,0,t3_5ha8xj,Oldest of three currently  the only son and mothers favorite ugh. My sister is about two years younger than I and our halfsister is currently  currently a senior in high school. This would be great if not for the fact that in our home state the age of majority is  so she is still legally our mothers property. Ill elaborate below but when mother and our stepfather little siss father divorced which mother initiated and little sis found living alone with our mother intolerable she went to her father and refused to return. Mother reported her missing and little sis was arrested and returned to our mothers custody even got suited up in juvie. Its hard. Mother pitted my sister and I against each other to an extent that Id describe as sick and irrespective of what I suffered our mothers treatment of our sister was criminal. As a preteen I bought into it and yes we hated each other fought viciously wished each other dead and were perfectly willing to throw one another under the bus if it meant sparing ourselves from our mothers wrath. Weve since reconciled and love each other as adults but that makes for a moral black hole that Im not sure Ill ever be able to completely escape. I shouldve defended her I didnt and thats something I have to live with. Our halfsister and I were and are extremely close our sister having earned her own moral black hole in her treatment of our little sister during her pre years. That said in little sisters teenage years our middle sis has stepped up admirably and they have a good relationship. Sister and I may disagree on how we should help her in whatever given situation but we share an adamant vow to do anything within the law we can to help her. Our mother was less functioning and hasnt had a successful career aside from having mastered using the courts to have our fathers pay her way She failed at scamming for disability lol. but she is intuitive and is second to none at manipulation sniffing out vulnerability intimidation and remorselessly inflicting pain. Shed never threaten suicide but would instead project that upon the child. Frankly during my childhood I feared being murdered if the father of my sister and I were ever to have prevailed in court. Mothers continually found new and inventive to abuse each of us though Ive got skill and distance on my side and middle sister has straightup gone NC with our mother. I left home at  got out to boarding school and never looked back. I was smart talented and gifted and played the education card to get myself out for good. Our sister did not have that luxury and did not leave until  in addition to having spent five years alienated from our father so she suffered some very severe damage that may or may not be able to be overcome. Im afraid that were both lucky to have made it through our early s alive and lacking criminal records.Our halfsister was blessed and cursed. She was blessed by our mothers relative indifference toward her during the entirety of her preteen years such that she was mostly cared for by the better caregivers in our family. On the other hand shell have her own set of issues to deal with from her fathers years of enabling predivorce and as a teenager she hasnt had the opportunity to build up resistance or experience in dealing with our mother and with whatever role genetics may play shes stuck with both grandmothers having suffered from BPD Its possible but Im not sure concerning my paternal grandmother but its blindingly obvious with her paternal grandmother..My sister and I can be there for our kid sister in ways that we didnt have the luxury of enjoying but pertaining to her education her father lacks the financial resources ours did and while her test scores were well aboveaverage she did not score well enough to have fullrides to choose from. Ill end briefly by mentioning that our former stepfather little sisters father did in fact sue for custody and went allin with everything he had. It wasnt much and his attorney a sole proprietor of a family law firm and in my opinion an incompetent moron had literally never heard of BPD or cluster B personality disorders at which point I knew they would lose and they did. The judge told my sisters to their faces that he didnt believe their testimony and ruled in favor of our mother. Ive never been so angry in my life. Life goes on however and the good news is that the actual circumstances that prompted little sister to want to live with her father have made the ruling irrelevant such that she mostly resides with her father. We can be there for her during her transition to adulthood and hopefully successful college education and I can be there as the best educated concerning BPD and psychology in general but I cant shield my kid sister from life and yes I do worry about her. Shes incredibly kind such that I fear her being taken advantage of and worryingly perfectionistic. ,raisedbyborderlines,daz2nxo,1,t5_33d8b

Many act out and have problems in school very young. You cannot formally diagnose BPD in children because of the parallels to immaturity and lack of empathy that comes with being a child. That doesnt mean the symptoms are not noticed in childhood and homes without abuse or neglect. Its very painful indeed to comfort those families.

She is treating you the way she treats the things she hoards  she has an endless appetite to acquire things and you and your time and your house but once she gets it she doesnt give a crap about it however much she has it is never enough  she is a bottomless pit and she can never be filled she can never be satisfied.  By anyone or anything.  You know this  look at all you have done!  And for how long you have done it!  I make the mistake with my uBPD Mother  I do and I give and think that eventually at some point she will have to see how good I am and she will love me.  It blows my mind to see that this doesnt work so I think oh maybe I just need to give her more do more for her put up with more of her crap  THEN she will see  so far for me this is not working.  It is just making me miserable and resentful and full of rage.  Are you planning on flying her down again?  Will she go berserk if she visits and discovers that HER room has been emptied?The attic sounds like a good first step.  When the dust settles you might want to pursue the legal issues of how long you might have to keep the stuff what steps you might have to take to notify her of the need for her to dispose of the items pick them up etc.If you can tolerate having her things in your attic you may be able to postpone a blowup.  But it sounds like a blowup is nonetheless in your future at some time.  Either she will nag you to fly her back down again and you refuse  or you fly her down and she sees what has happened or you start sending her notices and she gets the picture.  So  you might want to begin preparing now emotionally boundarywise for how you want things to go with your Mother over the long haul.  You have done so so much  if you had to prove something to yourself I hope you have succeeded.

But only recently have I learned that I should really look at actions and behaviors and not just intentions.I think a lot of it goes back to both of them threatening suicide when I was a kid and we would be arguing. That was their nuclear option to end the argument. And now I see how cruel it is.

10292888,0,t1_dc9qq98,Thanks this helps. The thing that annoys me is that her sending the card has nothing to do with our daughters feelings and everything to do with BPD mom trying to force a response from us. Sure its daughters birthday and a card is always nice but she hasnt ever asked about grandma or seemed upset about not seeing her. She did however mention a few scary times with grandma prior to our going NC.  So maybe its somewhat of a relief to her as well? Also we didnt get any kind of freak out like this for the other kids birthdays this is the th since we went NC She has probed my oldest via txt for our new address to no avail. I suspect this is all because shes angry at my oldests response of I think if mom wanted you to have it she would have given it to you.  Our mail is being forwarded anyway so it should still get here but it wouldnt surprise me at all to find out she never even sent one as this grandchild is not one she favored even before NC.

My therapist asksgtIf you didnt worry about what anybody thought said or did what would you do? So if your mom wasnt a part of the equation for a second what would you do? If your sister wasnt a part of the equation it was just someones wedding what would you do? Your sister sounds like shes leaving you an out she sounds like she will not be upset if you need to leave. I think you would have nothing to feel guilty about if something did happen. You have nothing to feel bad about on that drive home.  I think the bigger question is are you too terrified to go and see your mom? Will there be too much uncomfortable pressure from other family? This is legitimate. If you just cant do it dont do it.

10563158,0,t3_5r6xjb,My therapist has helped me identify trusting myself and shame which equals guilt as two areas to explore and work on. Ill share some of my processing with you. First recognizing that the voice that should have been the most trustworthy parent in our world was NOT trustworthy. I thought of this example to help me understandgtWhen a baby is little and gets hurt they will usually look at the parent to see what their reaction should be. So bonk  look at parent. If the parent freaks out the baby will cry. If the parent is calm comforting and reassuring the baby wont cry. The pain from the bonk is the same. But the parents input makes all the difference. You keep the baby calm and help them feel safe to serve the baby youre very often freaking out on the inside from the bonk but making the baby scared isnt good for the baby! So you dont do it. I feel like this is where we were misled. Our parents trusted voice was used to serve their own needs. Not ours. We were taught that making them unhappy was shameful. That having our needs was selfish. That we were responsible for them not ourselves. So we ended up dismissing our very SELF. Convincing ourselves for years that we dont matter. Second Ive been working on being mindful when that BPD voice pops up. I dont dismiss it right away cuz then I cant learn from it. I listen for a second correct it and then ask it to fck off. This has been really really helpful. The flip side of this exercise is to talk to myself as kindly as I talk to a friend. Ive learned from my activity here in the sub that I deserve to be as compassionate to myself as I am to friends here! I do you do we DESERVE that kindness. Good luck its a process. And youre already making progress by asking these questions! Hug.  ,raisedbyborderlines,dd5gbxx,4,t5_33d8b

10697126,0,t3_5njcse,I know that this post is old but I just wanted to give you support with your decision to be NC with your BPD brother.  I think you should trust yourself and protect yourself first regardless of what your mother stepfather or grandparents may want.  If you say that your brother is an abusive person who damaged you deeply growing up I trust you and you should trust yourself.  An abusive person like that does not deserve second chances but Im gonna guess that this would be his thousandth chance to be a good human being.  Done is done.  We do not HAVE to have relationships with our family members to suit others narratives.  If your brother was abusive to you and all of these people are pressuring you to see him and resume a relationship with him they are jerks that dont care about keeping you safe and healthy.  Plus your mother needs to accept the family that she has and get help for her own mental illness.  Kittenmommy is right you are not responsible for your mothers mental health.  It is really wrong of your stepdad to put that on you and it is emotionally abusive.  What if your mother hurts herself is that supposed to be your fault because you didnt want to talk to your brother?!  Thats ridiculous!  My father has uBPD my sister is diagnosed BPD.  She did not abuse me growing up but I am VLC with her for other behavior.  Thats my right.  Thats my choice.  Its between me and my sister and no amount of pressure or wanting from anyone else will make me feel differently about her.  Please dont subject yourself to any more abuse from your brother or father for the sake of your mother stepdad or grandparents.  Youve been through enough hell.  ,raisedbyborderlines,ddjbup9,1,t5_33d8b

10712565,0,t3_5t8j28,gt but I wonder are these normal wedding jitters or is this anxiety a symptom of being raised with BPD mom?A little bit of both probably. I was nervous before our wedding and was very nervous that Id chosen the right guy but I think thats common. I was with my husband for seven years before being married and there was still some doubt. A marriage is a big decision! I think there is a little bit of the selfdoubt because of having a BPD parent because OMG what if my mother pulls a nutty? Well mine did but I had people who handled her for me so it all turned out fine. It also helped my new inlaws have a lot more sympathy and understanding of my quirks. Now you cant ever truly know what is lurking in a person but if youve been together for a few years and you still like his warts maybe even think they are cute then you can figure it out. Trust and respect are the two biggest keys to a happy marriage. If you can trust each other and have respect for each other you can get through anything. Its when those disappear that you start getting into trouble. I will also put in a plug for premartial counseling if you are worried. That can be just for you or for you together. ,raisedbyborderlines,ddkx5zx,3,t5_33d8b

Regardless that must be hard depending on how close they are I cant even imagine NOTE FOR THE COMMUNITY Its important to note that contrary to what BPD trolls do intended to scare others it is not guaranteed in all children just like most disorders and PDs arent guaranteed to be passed down directly. If you have a lot of siblings odds are that one will have it yet not guaranteed again. In fact most will end up traumatized prone to CPTSD anxiety disorders and recurring depression.

She got upset with me that last time because she perceived me favoring my dad at an event a funeral that had nothing to do with either of them.

11304993,0,t3_61b198,It really depends on your relationship with your MIL. I have a petty good relationship with GMIL. My mom had been being friendly with GMIL lending each other books and maybe getting together once in awhile mostly casual stuff. When stuff was starting to hit the fan between me and my mom I knew my mom would start to talk behind my back to GMIL. GMIL is the only family DH and I have so I was terrified of losing her. So I sat her down and had a heart to heart explained what my mom was like and asked her not to share info about us with my mom. It went really well. She understood and when mom came around trying to get info about me GMIL refused to tell her anything because shes awesome and respects boundaries. Mom dropped her pretty quick once she knew she wouldnt get anything from her. Being honest worked for me because we already had a petty solid relationship. If youre close with your  MIL you might be able to talk with her. If youre not it might be best just to wait it out until your mom shows her true colors. Tell her you refuse to discuss your relationship with your mom because that is between your mom and you. Edited to add MIL said she didnt know what happened... lifes too short for petty disagreements...You could tell her Youre right you dont know the situation. Its not a petty disagreement. Go into as much or little detail as you want. But let her know it wasnt just an arbitrary punishment youre doing this for your own wellbeing. ,raisedbyborderlines,dfdejy4,4,t5_33d8b

I got out and the corners of our bumpers me quite obviously squishing mine in.I bawled. I also looked  and I was sobbing it was my first day with a license. The lady had me pull forward and her bumper was okay. Mine didnt look worse than the rest of the car really.Did I take the car home? Hah! Hahahaha! No. Because Im an idiot. So after almost running out of that tank of gas I went to a station near my apartment that evening... And found out why they have big metal poles in front of the pumps.

Sometimes they were just being normal kids and it was hard to deal with and sometimes I was feeling unreasonable. Just staying present with my emotions helped so much to respond appropriately.That can backfire there were times when I was too permissive or gave them too much space so they maybe didnt excel the way they could have with more of a push.

My phone provider has a service called premium visual voicemail for a few dollars per month that uses a computer algorithm to listen to your voice mail messages and transcribe them into text. ATampT Verizon TMobile Virgin Metro PCS Cricket and Sprint all seem to have it available as an option according to Google.So you dont have to listen to your BPD parents whining and guilting and pauses and crying and shouting but you can still get the words that they said. It makes getting calls from them a lot less awful and Id highly recommend it for people who frequently get calls from their parents. I only stopped paying for mine because uBPD dad has switched from spamming my voicemail box to spamming my email inbox.Edit it looks like different service providers have different names for it but if youre interested in giving your cell phone company more money every month Im sure theyd be happy to point you in the right direction lol,raisedbyborderlines,dgffh02,1,t5_33d8b
