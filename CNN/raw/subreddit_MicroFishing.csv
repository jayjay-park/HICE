4355582,0,t3_3aw5ge,I agree with you on it being a sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus and Im also a fan of observing and keeping native fish. I like your tank but am worried about the depth of your substrate combined with the large amount of dead organic material. Its a recipe for turning your tank into a fish gas chamber. Those fish are really hearty however and thats probably why it isnt dead yet.Im not sure the topic of this subreddit is very focused on native fish keeping but it comes up from time to time. PM me if you want to chat more about it.,MicroFishing,csglv24,4,t5_2vj6i
