36520,0,t1_ceifsld,Wow thank you. Very insightful  guessing your a HCP of some kind?I dont want anything fast acting mg Valium would be ideal I think. Going to try the these seem to work better when I take  route as opposed to straight up asking. There is nothing on my record about abuse.Interesting point about the SSRIs my past doctor made sure I was off them after  months with a taper. This was  years ago though maybe a good doctor and I was young? Either way thanks.Yes Im outside of London. A big city in the North West. ,benzodiazepines,ceil85m,1,t5_2s4go
37235,0,t1_ceil85m,Nope I just know a lot about why the NHS refuses to give me any damn benzos Yeah with no history of abuse on your record and you asking that sort of question you should be fine to get a higher dose as long as you have a good GP.Theyre a lot more relaxed about handing out SSRIs now than they were  years ago then or maybe you did just have a good doctor. They really do just hand those things out right now.Being outside of London will definitely help you.Good luck again!,benzodiazepines,ceio5hx,1,t5_2s4go
257637,0,t1_cf7fvs4,Thanks for the reply I appreciate the depth. I wonder why my doctor would say such a thing he told me I may experience mild symptoms for a while if I were to stop flat out. I guess perhaps these are mild symptoms vs seizures coma or flat out death? But while they do suck the thing is these are the symptoms minus the headache and nausea that i had in the first place but of course during the panic attacks I was getting before Xanax they were much worse than what I feel while Im off Xanax for a day or so. Also Im not building any tolerance. . does exactly what . did when I started. If I take mg I really feel something  and its fully recreational at that point. Ive researched withdrawal stories and suggestions and I found its mostly people who are saying their doctors started them on something absurd like mg a day wtf?. If I were to take mgs Id fall asleep immediately. I dont know how anyone can start on mgs of Alprazolam. But as youre taking a relatively weaker benzo than I and are experiencing withdrawal symptoms I have to believe what youre telling me. I also wish you the best my friend. Ive started taking B vitamins and then exercise helps a lot. Give it a shot if youd like maybe you too can find your self going  or  days without a dose. Just a note a friend of mine gets prescribed  every  months and runs through them in about a month and a half every time. Eats them like candy and has never felt a single withdrawal symptom. Kind of irks me. ,benzodiazepines,cf7gkzl,2,t5_2s4go

435005,0,t3_1ywhd6,Well after the end of day  just thought I should come back and tell you all I didnt die or end up Ina hospital! Did have some bad withdrawals all morning and no sleep last night but nothing unbearable I should have included this but I wasnt sure if it was dumb or not I had done a quick little  day taper after  days clean where I took only mg a day. In all honesty I was unsure if this did me more harm than good so I just left out stupid move on my part I knowI did keep xanax with me at all times for just in case moments if I felt things got of hand. looking bad however I was in pretty bad shape and didnt take any so idk how much worse I  would have gotten for me to take a half.Note I do not condone coming of any Benzo cold turkey. The only thing that kept me from jumping into a taper was the fact that I was so close to getting through it and Ive personally noticed that the withdrawals which bother me the most are still present unless Im completely clean twitching ,benzodiazepines,cfpuq5o,1,t5_2s4go

Like opiates its in your best interest to keep your dosages as low as possible for as long as possible. Was there a specific reason you increased dosages so quickly? If you are taking them for insomnia like myself then try keeping dosages as low as possible .mg and having a beer or two. DISCLAIMER MIXING BENZOS AND ALCOHOL IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS EXERCISE CAUTION. You will most likely get the desired effects for sleep and relaxation without having to keep increasing your dosages.

Which is unfortunate he was my favorite I use to get mg for  but usually just ordered .But even at double price compare that to xanax. And in my opinion etizolam is equal mg to mg and much more potentIf I went on the street and got xanax...if I was LUCKY and found a hook up for mg footballs for  and because of prescription drug crack downs footballs are  each each compared to what I ordered that would be double for half the fun.Even if I went back to my dr and got my  bars mg again.

Seriously Ive been down voted on this before but I dont care. For me Lorazepam is the most euphoric with the quickest onset of any benzo Ive tried. In my experience it also sets you up for horrible withdrawals in a case of  weeks. Maybe its just me but its the only benzo Ive experienced that horrible of a withdrawal from. It was like a  days bad acid trip. In hope your experience is better.edit typos,benzodiazepines,cy7nban,1,t5_2s4go

6075675,0,t1_cyfzl9k,as to your question as to how lexapro feels well its difficult to articulate and even try to compare myself to a year ago where i was suicidal with pretty bad social anxiety and depression. All I can tell you is that the bad thoughts are gone. I dont get shit scared at work asking a manager a question because they are an authorative figure i dont idealise suicide when i go to bed at night. I guess my thought process has changed and thus my depression and anxiety has mostly gone. I feel normal i feel as though what most people would feel without those issues. Im an introvert and im now comfortable with that before all i wanted to be was an extrovert. so im more comfortable with who i am. I have also used CBT tactics to deal with this just basic stuff really helps like deconstructing negative thoughts e.g. i might think im a total failure well you deconstruct that am i really a failure? well not really im good at this and that but im just not good at this. This is what CBT is about and you will feel better. However that doesnt help when you are bombarded with negative emotions it becomes exhausting. In my case therapy and pharmacology was suitable.as to the safety of taking drugs with SSRIs most drugs are very safe save few like DXM which can cause serotonin syndrome. as to amphetamines i felt like this was conterproductive to my anxiety but some people gain benefit as ive read anecdotaly online. As to doing drugs in general well im a former alcoholic so i dont drink much anymore but i do use drugs. benzos and opiates mainly mdma and pschs sometimes though they are blunted because of SSRIs.if lexapro and prozac dont do it for you dont be afraid to try other SSRIs exhaust those first then look into other drugs. I really recommend getting some knowledge on psycho pharmacology as you can get more out of your sessions with your psychiatrist. ,benzodiazepines,cyg08wj,1,t5_2s4go
6132938,0,t1_cymj1cp,It also depends at what time of the day you take them really if you take them in the afternoon then yes your arguments are acceptable but if you take them recreationally at night and you end up sleeping to close to your last dose you fuck up the majority of your sleep.

I wanted to attribute to stress but I wasnt stressed to begin with. I think that it accumulated in my system with its active metabolites. The wd was the worst experience in my life.

7520701,0,t3_4iba54,I know Im probably in the minority here but Ive been taking benzos consistently for  years temazepam diazepam and alprazolam and although Ive noticed  occasional shortterm memory problems I havent experienced any severe cognitive impairment. Id say on average I take either mg of diazepam .mg alprazolam or mg temazepam a day. Some days I take nothing at all. I definitely dont think benzos are a cognitive enhancer but used in moderation I really dont think they cause major irreparable cognitive damage. All that being said I do think that someone taking an average of mg of alprazolam a day every single day will obviously experince cognition problems and pretty intense memory issues.

Z drugs sleeping pills are very similar to benzos in ways and so its like youre taking extra benzos. I also dont understand why an antipsychotic and an antidepressant are also needed at the same time...not to mention that seroquel is sometimes prescribed to help people sleep especially in benzo withdrawal so a sleeping pill and a benzo! on top of that seems crazy. Ive been on most of that stuff at one time or another though not at the same time and its quite possible that any one of those things is creating a problem by itself or in combination with something else. Benzo withdrawal can definitely create the symptoms you are having but antidepressants can do the same thing.

This doesnt mean they are popping bars every day or anything but I am sure that most of them are taking them as needed. Most of us have no idea how ridiculously difficult it is to constantly be in the spotlight and lose your ability to lead a normal reclusive average life.In fact several commentators and even physicians speculated that Dr. Ben Carson who until he announced his candidacy was not really accustomed to wideranging public speaking was taking a benzodiazepine of some sort prior to speaking or participating in the GOP debates.Either way the marvelous effect these drugs have on anxiety and feelings of uneasiness make them very very useful in therapeutic practice.,benzodiazepines,d6ep5r2,1,t5_2s4go

Wont the same amount of substance be in the system its just more a hassle with the lower half life since it metobolizes faster?Also on subject wouldnt the metabolites build up in the blood be extremely high with the longer half life substance since some can stay around for  hours?A person tapering this would be a huge amount correct?Sorry Im not much human biologist connoisseur but learning on withdrawls from bzs,benzodiazepines,d6khhky,2,t5_2s4go

8709808,0,t3_4zaj97,I was around  before got with my first gf now wife. I feel like I got lucky. I feel like I wouldnt be with a girl until much later if it werent for this one. Shes like the exact opposite of me in terms of mental issues. That is to say she has none lol. Shes very outgoing and my problems dont drive her away which really blows my mind. We started out as friends in a group and I was able to get comfortable around her for many years before we started dating. If I had to meet a girl cold back then at that age I would not be able to do it I think. Im in my early s now though... women seem much more approachable now. I think a combination of working with women in the workplace  plus getting older makes it easier.Wish i could give you some advice or something. maybe just try and find a girl who you start out slow with as friends and see if something develops? You know like.. dont approach her with something really hard and maybe youll have less anxiety. or if you can get a youngish s s something like that female psychologist ... that would totally help you. because shes female and she can help you get comfortable around her and give you good advice and stuff. I would totally do this if I were in your shoes. Well you can do a lot of things and combined should help you get where you want to be. And dont worry too much if it takes a little bit of time to find the right person. its like as you get older you look back on the things that you used to worry about and think they are so small hahaLike now im on decent medication. dont know how I got this girl without being on anything back then but somehow i happened.

11634336,0,t1_dgeojr1,Ended up tapering less than two months.  It was the first cut that through me through a loop.  Cutting from  mg after  years to . mg.  I held it there for  weeks due to travel.  The severe muscle issues didnt start until  weeks off of benzos.  I never thought it would last this long.  Considering the damage done to my body and the fact that I am already  I think I may have lost the opportunity to have a baby.  Cant carry one in my current condition.  At least I no longer have to worry about being pulled of or cold turkeyed from the klonopin at some point in the future.  Who wants to be on a drug that if an emergency happened and you couldnt get to it the withdrawals could literally kill you?  Not likely from  mg but still  I had a seizure in the past so it is slightly possible.  I honestly believed my doctor that I would be fine in a few weeks.  If I had known this was possible I would have reinstated and tapered so much slower.  My life right now really sucks due to the pain but I dont want to have to start again from the beginning at this point.

11693300,0,t1_dgg0lay,Newer isnt better. Sertraline boosts dopamine a bit as well in addition to serotonin. Escitalopram doesnt. But I had way less side effects with escitalopram though.In general sertraline and fluoxetine is a more activating ssri escitalopram is more neutral. Paroxetine is more towards the sedation side.But if you need a dopamine boost as well as serotonin escitaloprambuproprion is the shit,benzodiazepines,dglgchz,1,t5_2s4go

11728581,0,t3_67bktu,No is it wrong to like things that are enjoyable. The real problems come from what are YOU willing to do to get more benzos imo,benzodiazepines,dgpgrbx,1,t5_2s4go

11737401,0,t1_dgqe839,Yeah thats pretty bad. Id look for valium. Were you taking them every day or did you binge on weekends.  Ive heard worse on this sub though you arent going to seize in my opinion still but you may want to be cleared by a professional   I personally have felt wds on far less than what you were taking but I feel very slight changes in my body. Psychedelics make me more sensitive to wds imo,benzodiazepines,dgqgq2g,2,t5_2s4go
11756202,0,t1_dgsk9pj,Exactly.  I get .g of gabapentinday and notice if I take around  grams I feel great but the next day you have to more than double it.  Day  IME no effects.  Weird but good drug,benzodiazepines,dgslflv,0,t5_2s4go
11784068,0,t1_dgv2k63,I realized I had sexual relations that might not have been consensual the same way. I never did find out what happened. I had a lot of emotions about that but ultimately had to just accept it. Hang in there and if you need to chat Ill listen!,benzodiazepines,dgvrgml,1,t5_2s4go

11790664,0,t3_6835wz,To play devils advocate couldnt it be argued the symptoms you list are withdrawal symptoms?I get what youre saying  dont get me wrong I had a panic attack in the middle of night just this week and thanks to Xanax not only did I get back to sleep but I got through work the next day even though I initially felt like utter shit when I woke up literally started crying for no reason. Anxiety is horrible and benzos are a lifesaver.However if youre used to taking benzos daily you likely get rebound anxiety when you dont take a dose and you have to consider that factor as well.,benzodiazepines,dgwif85,2,t5_2s4go

11806292,0,t1_dgy9dtp,Thanks for the reply. Ive tried counselling briefly and didnt find it helpful but it might be worth trying again. Also I should note I exercise regularly eat reasonably healthy etc. ,benzodiazepines,dgya8cy,2,t5_2s4go
