430817,0,t1_cfp9hkd,gt The reason I said that is because Red Hat or SUSE I suppose is the current industry standard.It shouldnt be though.  The cycle of suck has to be broken sometime.,slackware,cfpf3jk,1,t5_2qm1p
837194,0,t3_23ohwu,All my laptop Slackware installs are encrypted.  Thus they all consist of a MB boot partition devsda and the rest of the available hard drive space dedicated to a LUKSencrypted partition devsda which is used as an LVM physical volume serving as the only PV in the laptops volume group.  Once thats setup I create three logical volumes for  GB starting home GB starting and swap x the amount of physical RAM starting.  All of this is doable using the appropriate README files included on the Slackware install CDDVDUSBwhatever.This setup is advantageous for multiple reasons Encrypted so if someone steals your laptop heshe cant pull your sensitive data and sell it to Soviet spies... or something Flexible if you upgrade your RAM expand the swap LV if you need more space for music expand the home LV if you need more room for programs expand the  LV etc. Hibernation actually works in theory You can more easily reinstall or offlineupgrade your Slackware installation without nuking your homeMy desktop and nonvirtualized server setups tend to follow a similar scheme but with RAID thrown in the mix and with var on its own LV I typically dont use srv so I symlink it to var.  I dont currently use encryption on nonportable boxen though Ive been considering the use of keyfiles or somesuch with physical servers.If youre not sure though theres nothing wrong with a dualpartition   swap scheme if youre not comfortable with managing multiple partitions.  It just wont be as flexible in the long run and LVM is worth learning simply because of how much of a timesaver it is.,slackware,cgzfwrv,2,t5_2qm1p
2243863,0,t1_cloq3zy,Cool. I would get laughed at if I recommended Slackware where I work. Do you feel it is easy to maintain and update on a production system? We use RHEL and centos.... Their packages are so old! What are the uptimes on the slack boxes?,slackware,clp1q5d,0,t5_2qm1p

9794850,0,t3_5fhi60,I have installed Slackware on lvm with encryption since version ..?Do you want my notes?Edit sorry saw you mentioned boot specifically. It shouldnt be any different than what I do for root. Make the correct modules lvm and dmcrypt available at boot.,slackware,dakfdv6,2,t5_2qm1p
