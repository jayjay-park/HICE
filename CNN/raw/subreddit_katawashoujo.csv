428630,0,t1_cfp6xyz,ampampamp Retinitis pigmentosa sfw gtgtRetinitis pigmentosa RP is an inherited degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and often blindness.  The progress of RP is not consistent. Some people will exhibit symptoms from infancy others may not notice symptoms until later in life.  Generally the later the onset the more rapid is the deterioration in sight. citation needed Those who do not have RP have  degree peripheral vision while some people who have RP have less than  degrees.gtA form of retinal dystrophy RP is caused by abnormalities of the photoreceptors rods and cones or the retinal pigment epithelium RPE of the retina leading to progressive sight loss. Affected individuals may experience defective light to dark dark to light adaptation or nyctalopia night blindness as the result of the degeneration of the peripheral visual field known as tunnel vision. Sometimes central vision is lost first causing the person to look sidelong at objects.gtThe effect of RP is best illustrated by comparison to a television or computer screen. The pixels of light that form the image on the screen equate to the millions of light receptors on the retina of the eye. The fewer pixels on a screen the less distinct will be the images it will display. Fewer than  percent of the light receptors in the eye receive the colored high intensity light seen in bright light or daylight conditions. These receptors are located in the center of the circular retina. The remaining  percent of light receptors receive grayscale low intensity light used for low light and night vision and are located around the periphery of the retina. RP destroys light receptors from the outside inward from the center outward or in sporadic patches with a corresponding reduction in the efficiency of the eye to detect light. This degeneration is progressive and has no known cure.gtgtImage iInteresting Retinitis Pigmentosa International | Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator | Neuropathy ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa | Foundation Fighting Blindness Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfpyq oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfpyq.

1200755,0,t1_ci4lz2y,A few days ago I decided to try and see if I could handle Emis Bad End so I looked it up on Youtube Because as much as I want to finish the game  I dont want to encounter Emis Bad End and then have my depression spiral out of control. Its a bit personal as to why Id get depressed but lets just say Emi reminds me of an exgirlfriend. And it got to the point where Emi said those last words to Hisao and my heart broke. Mostly because it was extremely similar to my breakup. It hit me in all the wrong places. Actually I find it funny that I went through the breakup in October and then I discovered KS a few months later went through the Emi route and got the good end. I guess I learned my lesson. xDEdit Actually I think thats why I liked Emis Good End so much because it gave me a look at what couldve happened in the relationship I was in and it forced me to ask myself if I would like to be in that same situation with my ex. I thought about it for a couple of days and I came to the conclusion that I really wouldnt. Which is good because TBH I dont think she even knew what she wanted in a relationship so that sort of thing wouldve ended badly anyway. Now I just think that I should have played KS a long time ago.Sorry to hijack its just the talk of bad ends kind of reminded me of this little story.

1347400,0,t1_cil2d4t,Right. The way its written is such that if you understand one youre almost guaranteed not to understand the other. Either way that disconnect comes across.Rins story is all about her inability to relate to people in a normal fashion and all the ways that alienates her from the rest of the world. The point isnt to understand her or whether or not you do understand her or can understand her. Its a story about her and Hisaos struggles to overcome this disconnect and to accept each other as they are. But an inability to communicate breeds exasperation and impatience and so the story is constructed such that we have two extremes. You can empathize with one or the other but whichever side you fall on youre going to become impatient and frustrated with the other party. That lends the story a visceral immediacy that would be hard to convey otherwise. Its exceptionally well done.,katawashoujo,cil75g9,4,t5_2tb50

I think youre right on the money with Lily though I might say highelf sans the arrogance and world domination because of her elegant behaviour and foreign family I wish the had half elves.Hisao would be a knightEmi would be a rogue. oblivion class charisma based thief Its the closest thing to a pirate I can think of. She would put most of her points in stamina she would take the perks for speech particularly persuasion but she wouldnt be stealthy she would get through missions by running in and out I think wood elf would work her weapons would be the bow and arrow because archery is kind of track an field relatedShichan would be an imperial well off and somewhat proud values order and can be quite persuasive she would probably be the kind of Mage who wields destruction spells in one hand and restoration in the other. Her current quest list should always have way to many active questsHanako dark elf ostracised lost her home in a fire keep to themselves check out the race disposition chart from oblivion she would find all the skill books.  Mages are really better for school girls. She would follow the schools of alchemy experimental cooking illusion invisibility and mysticism got split between the other schools in skyrim but it was the skill for reading people eg clairvoyance detect lifeRin I have know idea maybe she would just hang out with Miac the LiarMisha would be a Nordic master of the voiceKenji would be HeimskrEDIT  I figured out what to do for Rin apparently there is a glitch where if you run out of Helgan without doing the tutorial no one ever unwinds your arms.

1529812,0,t3_2bqimt,Well girls read novels with male protagonists too right? Personally I didnt feel like I was in Hisaos boots so to say but that might be because I lack that kind of attraction to girls. I did however emphatize with many of the characters in a way lots of us probably did seeing parts of myself reflected in both Hisao and the girls. Generally I get very invested in stories and I dont feel the need to identify with any protagonists for that so thats alright.I played with the Hscenes on because I feel like theyre a integral part of each girls storyline... that and I like to see some of dem animu titties,katawashoujo,cj81exg,2,t5_2tb50

I completely agree with what you said about being so attached to a character in a way that I never have before. Lillys good ending also hit me very hard. Like you I have never cried so much in my entire life. It was especially emotional for me since I got the good ending completely organically on my first playthrough without using any kind of guide or anything. I later found out that it is the statistically lowest possible outcome in the game to achieve. Im not bragging well maybe a little but mostly I think I just got lucky. It felt like such an achievement after the fact and made that final scene after the airport that much more memorable.You are always welcome to share your feelings here in the future and I hope to see you around more my fellow Lillypad! ,katawashoujo,cjwjmia,4,t5_2tb50

Seriously my elem. teachers glorified my bullyies because hethey were good at sports our school was known for being the best in pretty much every sport in our region anyway while she humiliated me because she thought I was holding them back and sparking up confilcts with them.Im not the type that just lets himself be bullied I tried to speak up and went to get help from adults. What I got was misunderstanding and sport bigotry. When I fought back physically all I got were detentions for sparking up conflicts and a few painful bruises.But why am I writing this? Ive made it I eventually changed schools and this became just a sad memory. The thing is though  there are still kids out there who are experiencing the same shit I went trough maybe quite possibly even worse and they dont know how to reach for help if they arent afraid to do so in the first place. Every year I check the freshmen different school system when Im refering to freshmen I mean  year olds to see if there are any signs of bullying.

2336770,0,t3_2m30yf,Edit This is much longer than I expected with more detail than I had put before.Act I is almost entirely the same with just a few minor edits from then to now. Lilly and Rin have similar enough routes. A difference I remember in Lillys route is that she has to go to a hospital for tonsillitis. Emi apparently doesnt have an Act IV yet.For Shizunes differences this is a good summary.For Hanako Act II is very similar to what we have now. For Act III Hisao and Lilly look around town for a karaoke place to celebrate Hanakos birthday. During this Lilly tells Hisao a bit about her parents. They live in South Africa and own a mining company as opposed to living in Scotland and doing whatever they do.Edit Forgot this for a change in Lillys route. Akira is actually  years younger than Lilly in the prerelease but looks exactly the same and acts very similarly I dont think she drinks though. Akira is the one whos going to inherit the company later on she took on this responsibility so that Lilly wouldnt have to and instead could pursue her own ambitions I believe she wants to become an English teacher. If Akira hadnt been around Lilly would have been forced to inherit the company. Mining company and Lilly dont fit that well together if you ask me.At this point normally youd have to go through at least one Hanako bad ending before you can get her good ending but those working on the repair changed that.Around this time Hisao starts having adverse side effects like phantom visions and fatigue to his heart medication so he doesnt take it before going out with Hanako and Lilly to the Shanghai hoping to avoid the side effects before seeing the Nurse. As the three of them are eating some younger kids come along and begin to bother them. Hanako begins to break down and have a panic attack. In response Hisao takes her outside to get away from the source. The kids see Hanakos scarring and call her as well as Lilly freaks. This makes the situation even worse for Hanako so she runs off. Hisao runs after her but begins having a heart attack and Hanako runs back to him. The last thing he sees is Hanako pounding her fist into his chest in an attempt to keep Hisao alive.Both Hanako and Hisao are admitted to a nearby hospital. When Lilly visits Hisao he asks the doctors about Hanako. They suggest not seeing her at this moment. Hisao can either accept or refuse the advice.Refusing leads to the first bad ending. They go see Hanako who is really outofit by this point. She responds well to Lillys voice but when she sees and hears Lilly mention Hisao she screams and dashes towards the door. During this she knocks Hisao over causing him to start coughing up blood. Hanako starts saying how shes killed Hisao and everyone else. Hisao is quite stubborn and still tries to help. Hanako responds by hitting him on his chest causing even more blood to come out its compared to a waterfall if I remember correctly. As Hisao fades into unconsciousness and soon after dies he sees Hanako clawing her eyes out. Lilly likely has little idea as to whats happening compared to what Hisao and Hanako know so it can be assumed how shed react.If Hisao accepts the doctors advice Hanako and Hisao are released and return to Yamaku. Hanako is somewhat suspicious of Hisao intentions so to prove a point she tries to instigate sex between them. Hisao can either go through with it or deny it. If he accepts this leads to the second bad ending. Once Hanako can see clearly whats happening she forces him backwards and into a desk. As he hits the desk he slips and breaks his neck. Hanako just watches and calls Hisao Disgusting.If Hisao denies Hanako she drops the whole sex thing. This leads to the third bad ending. She thinks at this point that Hisao just doesnt care about her at all. Later on they both go to a train station where Hanako walks forward onto the platform. Hisao isnt sure whats happening or what to do. I believe she apologizes to Hisao and then she throws herself into the oncoming train committing suicide.After getting a bad ending as was intended or just choosing the good ending as you can in the repair its available in Hanakos route you go down Lillys path up until shes in the hospital. Lilly is worried about Hanako and asks Hisao to watch over her. If Hisao refuses and watches over Lilly instead it leads to her good ending. If Hisao accepts it leads to Hanakos goodtrue ending.As Hanako and Hisao spend time together they start becoming quite close. Not too long after he goes to her room but finds Hanako in Lillys room instead. Her nightlight went out and shes afraid of the dark. Hisao stays with her the whole night but sleeps on the floor Hanako brings him her pillow and sheets to sleep on at least. As they grow even closer Hanako admits her love to Hisao who is a bit shocked but accepts it with a kiss. They have sex on two separate occasions during the good ending. Later still Hanako Lilly Rin Shizune Misha Emi and Hisao form a study group for the upcoming exams where Hisao is the teacher. He helps them mostly with science but covers other areas as best he can I think. They all up end doing quite well on their exams thanks to the idea of the group. It is worth noting that Hanako is much less nervous and skittish than she normally would be.Edit Forgot this scene which is pretty important. At some point during or around when the study group is formed and going on Hanako invites Hisao for a picnic in a special place she found outside of Yamaku. Shes wearing a yellow dress that reveals her arms and some of her legs which shows a lot of improvement. Theres apparently a forest behind Yamaku. They walk through it for at least an hour or two before reaching their destination which is on a cliff overlooking a large part of the forest. Its actually quite the sight to behold. No one around for large distances and its full of untouched nature trees rivers maybe? etc.. They dont have a lot to eat but they spend several hours just spending time with each other.Later still Hisao and Hanako board a train to go to where Hanakos old house was shes unaware of this for a while. When they find the house its actually not her old house but someone elses Hanako breaks down as she did in the park in her route. Hanako didnt want to face her problems especially this one up until this point. She tells Hisao everything about the fire and her adoptive parents especially about her adoptive mother who was quite cruel to her. When Hisao learns this he holds Hanako closely promising to be there for her though he was there for her before that. This makes Hanako visibly happy and Hanako tells Hisao that this was a good idea for her to be able to move on. They board the train to go Hisaos parents house where they have some time alone as his parents are out. It cuts off there.,katawashoujo,cm0jcxn,25,t5_2tb50

My bad.What I meant to say is when the first time you played KS didnt you have that feeling like the chances of having a story where the main character just so happens to have the same problem as you and having the story also being one of the best so you were kinda feeling like it was a rare coincidence.Like many people read a good story and relate to the main character for example being shy around girls. You however got an amazing story where you can relate to the main character by saying you have the same disease. What are the chances of that happening?You know what? I give up on explaining. Nice story though. Im surprised she didnt notice you after your heart was giving out.,katawashoujo,cnacehr,1,t5_2tb50
2696263,0,t1_cnacehr,Oh yea that. When I first started and got to the point of where they said what he had my first reaction was something like okay who was the asshole that recommended me this game then after thinking for a bit before realizing that I had decided on playing it after seeing a few of those fake pictures. After that however I did get attached to Hisao and other characters for more how should I put this specific reasons. But Ill cover those when I finally get around to doing a proper review.Unlike OP or Hisao however I havent ever had a major event because of people like that since I was little. I actually tend to avoid people especially females due to social anxiety and panic disorder which has lead me to having Agoraphobia. Think if you multiplied Hanakos problems by  and then fused her with Hisao. otherwise known as not good.Instead in somewhere between rd and th grade when my dad finally explained why I could play soccer but not goalie baseball but not bat and why I couldnt play football he pretty much let me play anything that wouldnt get me hit hard so long as him or my mom kept an eye on my the whole time except lift weights I decided fuck it Im gonna lift weights without telling him. And I was GOOD at it like by the end of th grade I was benching my CURRENT weight of  lbs. or .kg! Unfortunately I ran into a constant problem. Remember in Emis route how you can push yourself running to the point of nearly having a heart attack? Well I was running into that problem about once a WEEK. Luckily is wasnt a complete moron and had one of my few friends there as a spotter. What I didnt know is that after the first few times about a month or two in he had told my dad. So that night when I came home my dad was PISSED and tried getting me to stop. Groundings spankings doubling chores anything to get me to stop lifting.So why is everything your saying in past tense by the sound of it you didnt stop lifting did you? you my ask. And I didnt up until th grade. In P.E. we were working out one day and I really wasnt lifting much so I didnt draw any unnecessary attention to myself when a few of the jocks where picking showing off and picking on some other students who couldnt lift even half as much. Something you must remember is that I never could get rid of much fat even when I constantly worked out so I still looked relatively fat. This pissed me off to the point of having a moment of stupidity where I told them to load up and bench their max and that Id beat it. So one of them got up and put on lbs. and benched maybe  reps with it and told me to beat it. So I got up there benched  got off the bench and loaded on another  lbs. and made a stupid move. I got the bright idea that oh Ive been benching  for about  weeks now I can move up another  and loaded up the bar so that there was lbs. in weights and went to lift it. Now if it was just me and my friend that probably would have been fine but after the first rep by brain started working again and I realizednoticed something. There was now  people watching me and with two bars to my sides along with  pounds of weight above me Id trapped myself in. Upon realizing those I started to have a panic attack while lifting. I cant remember the details after that other than that I had a heart attack.Holy hell I had always thought the pins and needles thing was a bit cliched but thats what it was like. Imagine that feeling you get when your leg has fallen asleep and you immediately start walking on it now multiply that by  and put that entire feeling in your chest. After that I blacked out and woke up in the hospital. Luckily my P.E. teacher knew my situation and had called an ambulance as soon as I started showing signs of a heart attack. He was also nice enough to tell everyone that that anyone talking about what happened outside of class would have to run ten laps around the track plus be given  days of detention. According to one of the guys in my class I did get to  reps but even so I finally realized why my dad had gotten so pissed and never worked out more than regular P.E. minimum again.TLDR I did connect with Hisao because of heart problems. I dont have problems triggered by females because I avoid them. I used to work out alot until I had a heart attack in class.,katawashoujo,cnair04,2,t5_2tb50

2898780,0,t1_cnxkum4,Perhaps I worded that poorly.Im convinced that what Hanako needed more than anything else was a friend that wasnt Lilly. As great as Lils is she cant help with Hanners hangups over her scars.She gets that friend in both her route and Lillys route. However in her own route the friendship is unknowingly condescending because Hisaos a dingus. Up to just before the big climactic scene in her route Hisaoasloveinterest isnt as good for her psyche as Hisaoasfriendwithfunctionaleyes. In Lillys route he isnt giving Hanako as much attention and that ironically is better for her.I agree that post game Hanako is probably better off with Hisao than without. Its not like I think the lads a bad guy  a bit romantically dim perhaps but overall a solid positive. However during the game she gets over her issues regardless of if shes with him and being with him causes a few very stressful months hence my impression that hes a better friend than lover at least at this stage of her life.,katawashoujo,cnxlhnc,1,t5_2tb50

3565205,0,t1_cpy075l,Thank you! Yeah the two ways that it can be read are by arc or by overall chronological. The first allows you to do it as if youre hearing the same story from different POVs and with different critical points. The second allows you to see how they sort of work together. YMMV.If reading by arc there is probably a best sequence but you can try the bestgirl approach. It probably works best for Shizune or Emi is difficult with Rin since Rin sees things very differently is very literal and literate with Lilly and Hanako. Misha is a curious narrator as its hard to tell what shes hiding or shading. SLEHRM probably works as a sequence I guess. Enjoy!,katawashoujo,cpynrod,1,t5_2tb50

I dont know if its malintent always just a fear of what we dont understand.

Lilly is the embodiment of stability and comfort which is great because it leaves you with the ability to simply focus on the romance and the raw emotion that comes with it. Rin on the other hand is the exact opposite. You have absolutely no idea what sort of romantic attraction there is or if you have one at all for that matter. Youre left to dig through the chaotic cloud that is Rins mind and personality trying to find some common ground and even though at least in my opinion you never find any you learn that that attraction is more affixed on that chaos itself and how it complements you.,katawashoujo,crjyfgj,3,t5_2tb50

4167612,0,t3_38gyrv,gt WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE THIS PATH? I DONT UNDERSTAND! Ahem. I got this! I dont know if many people HATE her path... but lets objectively compare it to the others. Lilly sweet cliche romance. Emi lots of trials and tribulations with extra gratifying romance as you break through her emotional wall. Hanako lots of trials and tribulations with mega ultra gratifying romance as youve broken through her almost impenetrable wall and finally get close to her.Shizune slice of life character study with little to no romance.Which one doesnt really belong with the rest? To be honest... it feels like Shizune got the short end of the stick. Is a character study bad... no. Is it disappointing when everyone else has a nice romantic story with their  girl and all Shizune fans are left with little to no closure but instead this nonsense Of course then there is the prerelease if it were a drinking game of drink whenever I mention it most of the sub would be dead by now. It tells a semidark extremely emotional and complete story that satisfies me as a Shizune fan. Yes its not cannon. No A might not have liked it and thought it was subpar to what he released in the final game. Regardless of all of that it is an excellent story and my personal favorite.

As for the numbers of people considering bikinis or lingerie NSFW I think youd find out pretty quickly what the public opinion on that is if you asked people.Your argument that something is not NSFW because theres nothing showing is flawed. Using that logic you could post a picture of somebody wearing nothing but tiny squares of duct tape over their nipples without marking it as NSFW.

I didnt really care for the good ending because I would rather be with Misha. I havent played any of the other bad ends because I would be legitimately sad as I like the characters. Well except Hanako but I saw the picture of her screaming and its absolutely fucking terrifying.Also in Shizunes route Misha cuts off her drills which is bad.

5578651,1,t1_cwoki0j,Despite the confusion that still exists for a short period of time feelings can be expressed without words. Hanako is showing her scars to him just as he did for her but she also wants to have sex with him. If Hisao didnt care about her he would have refused and not verbally confessed his feelings. He doesnt confess his feelings verbally until the next day but he accepts her and does his best to make the act as comfortable for her as he can.Hanako likely and correctly takes that as he does have feelings for her. If he didnt he would have just left. But... Hisao didnt leave. Of course having verbal confirmation helps but she can be relatively sure that he likes her a lot.Hanakos route doesnt feature a lot of dialogue because dialogue is difficult for them. Therefore an action coming before the words fits well enough.,katawashoujo,cwol0sd,-1,t5_2tb50

6440112,0,t1_czlcjy5,Violence is extremely common in videogames and movies already. In GTA with the exception several scenes violence is almost comical. Repercussions dont really happen things explode characters get shot people drive monster trucks off of buildings it happens so often in GTA that it is meaningless. Then you respawn and do it again maybe with your friends this time. It is a bunch of random characters exploding. Very rarely does the game actually take itself seriously.Actions like suicide bullying and creep shots may not seem that horrible in a videogame to gamers like us however they are sensitive issues for many people right now especially outside of the Reddit circle. Watching characters get bullied cry and commit murdersuicide in a school setting hits far closer to home for many even if the game looks like an anime. Twitch is completely entitled to say Were not okay with our streamers broadcasting content like this and if they decide to draw the line at YS then so be it.

You faced the criticism and this has been your response to everything that has happened?You could have changed the logo from a Katawa Heart Logo ripoff but you didnt.You could have changed the story to be different from what has literally already been done by Katawa Shoujo but you didnt.You could have changed the sprites of characters to be different especially considering the awful RinEmi hybrid but you didnt. You cannot claim ignorance or coincidence when your game has already attempted to be a second version of Katawa.You could have distanced yourselves from  Leaf Studios and made it clear you have no affiliation in any way shape or form but you didnt.Have you not seen the world of visual novels around you? There are so many indie developers who have started as groups who want to make something to capture that essence that magic of Katawa Shoujo. But they have taken the game as inspiration and aim not to steal fans by falsely claiming an association with the original game. They just want to make something special.To all of those developers who have worked tirelessly to build themselves from the ground up you insult them. You embarrass them and yourselves.I wont doubt your ability to make a visual novel in some capacity Your beta will tell that. And I wont sit here and say you should scrap everything and start new.

I found myself able to relate to both Hisao and Rin as character in that route and thus Hisaos behavior didnt bother me.On the other hand I never connected to Emi at all and while I dont think her route is bad I just never felt anything from it.I guess after a certain point it becomes a matter of preference and which characters appeal most to you.I definitely do see what you are saying about the reader jumping further ahead of Hisao. And it is annoying when the reader sees what should be done but the characters seem slow to realize or react.

9682141,0,t1_da67d7d,Yeah Ive already had a kind of awkward talk with my brother about it. My sister was really cool about it which was expected because of the kind of person she is. The people here on reddit my brother and my sister are the only people Im out to yet. I dont think Im going to tell my parents until after I move out they will NOT be happy about it. Thank you for the advice.  ,katawashoujo,da6j0qo,2,t5_2tb50

I WENT TO INVERNESS those who have completed the route will know why its relevant to KSPlease excuse the trash night photos it was late and didnt get a chance to see it in the morning Such a beautiful city D Now to what happened in the previous week I was in London as I said last week I had just checked into Grosvenor House Park Lane so after  days in London I took the train to Edinburgh Scotland. I then drove up to Inverness stayed the night and came back down to Glasgow where I am now to catch my flight tomorrow to Iceland London was amazing once again I saw the fireworks which were beyond incredible... jaw droppingly good o I was right underneath Big Ben one of the best night of my entire life Over the next  days in London I caught up with some friends who were from Adelaide South Australia where I currently live. This was awesome we met at Buckingham palace which just added to the effect  I had an amazing time with them just catching up and talking about our overseas trips. I also went to Oxford University which is absolutely stunning... I wish I was a student there I may be reasonably intelligent but damn...  places for  applicants would be unlikely. I also saw some general touristy sights for another of those days the st was a right off after New Years Eve Scotland is so beautiful... fed some wild deer saw a few castles and of course Loch Ness which is just outside of Inverness head south where the river goes off screen and youd be in the Loch As I said Im in Glasgow about to sleep I have a plane to Iceland tomorrow where Ill hopefully be seeing the Aurora Borealis apparently lots of solar activity in the next few days D. Ill also be seeing the only place where  tectonic plates meet on land and Ill also be swimming in the Blue Lagoon a huge heated hot spring. I hope all you guys are having an awesome ! Ill be coming back to read comments so keep posting. Also welcome all the new subs from rgaming glad to see the community thriving Lastly thanks umaybenickcage for consistently posting this thread its great to see what other are up to. ,katawashoujo,dc3fa6v,4,t5_2tb50
