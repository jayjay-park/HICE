If you do have it your day to day wont change other than taking a pill in the morning and the occasional checkup. Someday you may need surgery or you may not. The only real difference is that now youll know and that puts you in a position of power. ,marfans,cj6383c,2,t5_2se3o

The physical activity limits for sports arent only because of the heart Marfan patients are very prone to their lenses dislocating which can cause blindness. Impacts can cause that to happen. They are hypermobile which can cause joint damage and dislocation risks. Can they play recreational sports? Yes. Should they? Depends on the person. My son isnt even allowed to take gym class this upcoming school year not because of the Marfan diagnosis but because he has severe scoliosis caused by the Marfans and will be having spinal fusion surgery soon.  Marfan patients are looked at on a case by case basis if they seek out health care. Every person is different. There will never be a professional athlete with Marfans on a team because every athlete is insured by their team. No insurance company will insure a Marfan athlete. They will never be drafted. College sports are even starting to screen student athletes from what Ive been told. They wont be eligible there either. We just found out a month ago our son has Marfans. We have been to multiple doctors in the past  months. This will not limit his future but why would I encourage him to do something that could greatly shorten it? Competitive sports isnt something that most people attain. They can do moderate activities just like the vast majority of the population. They shouldnt run marathons they will not be allowed to play competitive sports at most levels but that doesnt mean they cant do anything but sit on the couch. ,marfans,d60og1a,3,t5_2se3o
8473369,0,t1_d60pftv,Why dont you go read Marfan.org and read what professionals that dedicate their lives have to say about this. There are different levels of anything in life. I dont understand why youre containing to argue about something that you obviously dont know much about. Were living this. Its real. Its my kid. He will do what his doctors say. Period. And yes my kid is a spontaneous mutation. No he doesnt have a severe case. Hes got a normal case. A normal case that involves his heart eyes and bones. Just like a lot of people that have it. Oh and you cant cure a genetic mutation. You may learn better ways to treat it to lesson the symptoms but you cant change someones genetic makeup. ,marfans,d60pnns,1,t5_2se3o

Granted he also seems to be a bit harder on his own body but when I read about things like this and all the issues hes had I realize that despite all the trouble Ive had in my life that where I lay on the scale of how bad things can get with Marfans is not at all where I think it is...,marfans,d708man,1,t5_2se3o

11766341,0,t1_dgt4tc6,Oh fuck me I hate the spirometer. Hate. Them. Three lung collapses and I am far more acquainted with those accursed things than Id like to be. Ive had a similar type of pain before from both a bowel resection and abdominal hernia surgery in the aftermath. It is just startling how much we use our core without realizing it. I fucking hated life for a bit and became best friends with my pain pills. Im sure Ill feel the same way whenever this thing goes down.Thanks for being so encouraging! Im gonna need all if that as I can get whenever this thing actually does go down! But not this year thank goodness.,marfans,dgtqu02,1,t5_2se3o
