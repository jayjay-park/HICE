502392,0,t3_1zvbgl,Quick Summary  Become a part of the Terrafugia transportation revolution today! TFX is the practical realization of the dream of countless visions of the future it is designed to be the flying car for all of us. In order to achieve this longsoughtafter vision Terrafugia will focus theTFXprogram with clear goals that enhance the safety simplicity and convenience of personal transportation. We believe these goals are achievable today. Development ofTFXis expected to last  years. If you wish to be one of the first to own aTFXvehicle consider reserving a Transition today. The Transition will be delivered long before the TFX is ready and as loyal Terrafugia customers Transition buyers will be given the option to purchase TFX vehicles before the rest of the public. The knowledge and experience you gain as a Transition owner will help prepare you forTFX and your feedback on our first product will help us craft the second. In order to facilitate the achievement of this new dimension of personal freedom the TFX will be priced as low as possible while still allowing Terrafugia to grow to support our customers. The final pricing will not be set until we are much closer to delivery. The biggest price driver is the cost of production. It is likely thatTFXwill be more expensive than a normal car due to the higher costs of the enabling lightweight materials but with investment in automotive scale production early studies indicate that it is possible that the final price point could be onpar with very highend luxury cars of today. As demand increases new materials and manufacturing processes will surely be developed and the price may come down further in the distant future.Disclaimer this summary is not guaranteed to be accurate correct or even news.,realtech,cfxdiwi,1,t5_2y747

If you need more convincing then check out The Times interview over the weekend with Apple design boss Jony Ive who unleashes blistering criticism of companies whom he thinks have shamelessly copied Apple over the past several years particularly in the realm of smartphones and tablets. Although The Times interview is behind a paywall Macworld has pasted some choice quotes from it in which Ive lashes out at companies who release anonymous poorly made objects that he says rip off Apples designs but dont come close to matching their quality. And unlike Microsoft which has been content to grow fat on Android patent royalties Apple has shown no signs of being willing to compromise with copycat companies. Just last week we learned that Apple is asking that Samsung pay a whopping  per smartphone as a condition for licensing just five patents a demand that would almost guarantee that Samsung would never be able to make a profit selling smartphones again.Disclaimer this summary is not guaranteed to be accurate correct or even news.,realtech,cg4y8nr,1,t5_2y747

By injecting a virus carrying the SEAP gene into the brain cells of mice the researchers were able to incorporate the gene into the cells own genome. The system also provides the possibility of readout both in the living animal and bypostmortem histology and it notably does not require intracellular delivery of the contrast agent. Brain cells then started producing the SEAP protein which is secreted from the cells and can be anchored to their outer surfaces. In this study which was designed to test this general approach the detection system revealed only whether the SEAP gene had been successfully incorporated into brain cells.Disclaimer this summary is not guaranteed to be accurate correct or even news.,realtech,cgcbuva,1,t5_2y747

Some current medical devices like hearing implants use nearfield technology. In the experiment Poon used her midfield transfer system to send power directly to tiny medical implants. A wireless system developed by Assistant Professor Ada Poon uses the same power as a cell phone to safely transmit energy to chips the size of a grain of rice. A Stanford electrical engineer has invented a way to wirelessly transfer power deep inside the body and then use this power to run tiny electronic medical gadgets such as pacemakers nerve stimulators or new sensors and devices yet to be developed.Disclaimer this summary is not guaranteed to be accurate correct or even news.,realtech,chmi3ye,1,t5_2y747

Leave a comment shoot me a tweet at eharris However the industry is trying to tell you that they dont need to know what your data is they just want to process it for you. But as with everything there should be a certain amount of caution when moving workloads to the cloud. Many users will forever be skeptical of just how much control they have over their data. I wrote a few blogs recently on Cloud for small business and Microsofts Office  being safe for businesses. The aim of those blogs was to help readers understand the direction of the tech giant. Microsoft has been touting its security measures and how Office  is mature enough for government data storage. They have strengthened their position with acquisitions of large state government clusters such as Chicago New York and Texas. As Office  gains momentum in the government arena they will continue to market how the platform is ready for your businesses data. But what does that really mean and how does that affect all the other providers of cloud services?Disclaimer this summary is not guaranteed to be accurate correct or even news.,realtech,chxoufe,1,t5_2y747

On top of this he points out that tokenization wouldnt be limited to credit cards. However Zielke explains that tokenization is mainly for protecting your credit card information and other sensitive information when it is kept on file for future use. Chips are more expensive than magnetic strips and the terminals that read smart cards would need to replace the current terminals. As helpful as tokenization would be its not a cureall for the data breach problems that seem to beset us on every side.Disclaimer this summary is not guaranteed to be accurate correct or even news.,realtech,ci30gua,1,t5_2y747
