5633324,0,t1_cwg6g1y,Thats the Sierra.  I did get confirmation that there will be a Canyon Denali from my guy at GMC.  I just got the Canyon SLT as I dont think the Denali will come with an engine upgrade.,gmc,cwvd89w,2,t5_2then
7846174,0,t3_4dvd4d,Dont know if this is still relevant to you...I own a  SLT with the .L V. Its my wifes daily driver. Bought it new and she still likes it. Its roomy enough for us a kid in a car seat and a dog with luggage. We dont travel particularly light. Its comfortable for long drives. Like most modern SUVs rear visibility is atrocious. The A pillars arent great for visibility up front either. Little fit and finish stuff from the beginning but nothing major.It hasnt been the most reliable car. It has always had issues with the electrical system. The radionavbackup camera went through probably  years of constantly bringing it in for servicereplacement before it they got it squared away. Its had transmission troubles. The battery is tucked under the engine computer and the cables are short as hell so its a pain to replace or clean. I actually made up my own negative cableground strap so that I could remove the cable to clean it when necessary. Speaking of which I have to do that pretty frequently  I suspect the alternator is overcharging the battery causing excessive corrosion. Going to get that looked at next time it goes in for service. And it took me a solid hour and a whole lot of swearing to get the bolt for the engine ground back into the block.,gmc,d3xz8wf,1,t5_2then
8249786,0,t1_d58ibx4,I assume it wasnt garaged in FL? I havent seen paint issues really on those cars. Perhaps being out in the strong sun has done a number on the paint.The AC trouble seems like a common problem. The oil leak is more common in the  generation afaik but im not surprised of that possibility on the older generation with that many miles. ,gmc,d58s2hd,2,t5_2then
9155723,0,t3_55kr9y,One time my  Sierra wouldnt start after leaving it in my garage over night. I had to disconnect the battery to make it work again. Never figured out what caused it. The empty battery tray up at the front of the truck is for auxiliary batteries for accessories like a snowplow. Its been pretty commonplace on GM trucks since about .Also side note you said you have a  SLE . speed? I was under the impression .s with the  speed were only available on SLT and higher trims. How did you manage to get a . and  speed on an SLE trim? ,gmc,d8cjyi0,1,t5_2then
