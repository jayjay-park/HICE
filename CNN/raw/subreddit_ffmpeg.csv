2943429,0,t1_co2mfwq,frame is the current frame number being processed time the current time how much is done indeed. fps is the fps of the encoding process and q is the quality or quantizer not sure i always think of the quality of the encoded frame its usefull for vbr and qscale to see if  you need to adjust the values lower is better quality afaik. size is the current total size of the encode and bitrate is the bitrate for the frame.,ffmpeg,co2oj3h,2,t5_2sf4l
4326709,0,t3_39kmwj,You can use filtercomplex to trim the video.I am not sure if you can use it at all without reencoding though. I currently only use it combined with a reencode because I do not want to be bound to key frames when cutting.,ffmpeg,csdcksu,1,t5_2sf4l
4503866,0,t3_3c3dx8,In what way were you hoping to modify the Iframes? Like only cut on Iframes? Would you know in advance where theyre all going to be?Someone a bit better qualified with FFMPEG than myself could probably answer this better as I really just use it as a failsafe transcoding suite when my proprietary solutions dont work but with that caveat since no one else has answered in  days I think I might know a way to point you in the right general direction. Just take it with a pinch of salt.in the following link  there is a section regarding using bitstream copy in combination with the seek command it mentions that using these commands in combination has a drawback not being totally accurate as ffmpeg is forced split on iframes. Presumably you could then specify the points in time you want to use to define a range and copy the bit stream to a new file you could also then copy all your results together in to a single container presumably without reencoding by using the concat command.The trouble is Im not totally sure what you meant by only modifying I frames though because I dont know what modification youre talking about if the iframes are visually changed in some way like editing the frame itself as a still image then presumably the P and B frames would need to be reencoded as they are generated in reference to their nearest iframe and would store only the pixels that have changes since the nearest I frame and depend upon it being unchanged. I dont know if the result would be that the encoded pixels in the P and B frames the ones that changed since the nearest Iframe would remain as they were and those pixels that referenced the nearest I frame would now reference the modified Iframe thus resulting in some pretty weird shit or if youd just have an unplayable file but either way I cant see that working anyone might want unless artistically youre trying to explore what the effects of such bizzare results might yield.,ffmpeg,csyd49t,1,t5_2sf4l

10781892,0,t3_5u6rya,Try replacing vcodec h with cv hvideotoolbox.You will also have to specify a bitrate for the video. K should be enough for p. So add bv K.This might not work and if it does it might not speed things up at all. It uses whatever hardware accelerated video encoding your Mac has available which might be none at all.The scaling filter youre applying will slow things down. You also should specify how many audio channels you want as your current command line will use however many channels your input audio track has. Add ac  to downmix this to stereo. ,ffmpeg,dds2nwu,2,t5_2sf4l
