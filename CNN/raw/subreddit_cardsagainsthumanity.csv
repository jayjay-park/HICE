773107,0,t3_22z1py,Its something weve certainly thought about but havent really come to a final conclusion on. There are a bunch of different issues at work some I can talk about and some I cant. As Dave implied in his post in this thread were a very small operation and have to decide where we focus our resources and time. Frankly the number of people whove asked about it has been very small you could count them on the fingers of one hand. I dont really believe that CC licensing would reduce sales of the physical game but it would seriously affect our longterm goals and flexibility.As far as the moral argument if you look at CAH and us there are some major major differences in how we came about. CAH was a kickstarted communityfunded project where the CClicensing was a part of the deal from the very beginning. With us it was me taking a chance with the very last of my savings and putting all the rest on an overworked Mastercard and betting it all. I didnt ask anyone else to share the risk. ,cardsagainsthumanity,cgs5nks,4,t5_2tafq

9782603,0,t1_daimhei,Warehouse facilities that do pick pack and ship operations to fill customer online orders will often print the FedEx shipping label at the same time they print the pick sheet a list of the items and quantities the customer ordered their stock locations in the warehouse and instructions on when to pull the order and ship it...usually immediately but sometimes it can be ship after suchadate if the customer says they wont be at the delivery address until a particular date.   So if your order was printed off the FedEx label could have been printed at the same time and the label is will the pick sheet but maybe your order wasnt actually pulled from stock yet.  Or maybe it was but still needs to be boxed up and sent.  I worked for over a decade in a depot that had Pick Pack and Ship operations and this wasnt uncommon. At the end of a shift especially a shift that wrapped up in front of a major holiday such as Thanksgiving there would be orders sitting there waiting to be filled by the next shift to come in in this case right after the long holiday weekend.  ,cardsagainsthumanity,daix42h,1,t5_2tafq

9884285,0,t1_davmr24,Just wanted to let you know I had some extra time and ended up pulling out my cards and comparing them to the pax cards anyway. I can post my findings in whatever order would help you the most. Currently I have the pax cards in the order of the spreadsheet listing with the word Geek in parentheses next to each card in the geek pack. I can rearrange it however is easiest though. Let me know if I should post it or who I should send it to.,cardsagainsthumanity,davy2hq,1,t5_2tafq
