440272,0,t1_cfqe89f,We dont know how much she pays herself for labor.  Could be that she pays herself  or  an hour plus gives herself health benefits and the like.  I only used the  figure to make an example.  Also this is a hand made in america product not a sweatshop product.  A similar hoodie that is screenprinted and made in a sweatshop will easily sell for  dollars.  Or not even that those bubble compacts are selling for over  a set on ebay.  Thats over  for some plastic crap made in a chinese factory.Its cool for you to think this price is unreasonable.  However I disagree. Then again there are people that think paying for  for a pair of jeans made in a honduran sweat shop is reasonable and I think its ridiculous.Ultimately people place different priorities on different things and are going to have different things they like to spent money on.  For example my husband thinks its ridiculous for me to spend  on face cream meanwhile he will easily spent  or more a month on collectible art toys.  Different priorities and different values.Or maybe she is slow sewer.  I made a vest for a friend using a commercial pattern.  Overall it took me easily over  hours.  Her stuff sells though so clearly there are plenty of people out there willing to pay her price.,sailormoon,cfqedft,3,t5_2sjms

1453203,0,t1_ciye0s9,Demand and Saphir deserve more love certainly.  Rubeus well i can see him not being popular.  He is essentially the only member of the BMC in the anime to have no redeeming feature whatsoever.  Esmeraude at least has her fans due to her comedy and her genuine love for Demand.  Rubeus however is a sociopathic asshole who shamelessly manipulated the Ayakashi Sisters especially Koan who loved him and abused them and was planning to kill all four of them once they had served their purpose or ceased being useful to him and steal any glory for their successes.  Demand however I can see him not being popular due to him basically attempting to rape Sailor Moon in a PG setting. Saphir however is a sweetie and a hottie. ,sailormoon,ciyfn56,1,t5_2sjms

1461456,0,t3_2aw8z0,My honest to god thought on this is its probably due to budget constrictions that it looks so bad. Precures transformation sequences are fantastic since its a blend of D animation and hand drawn animation. Its lively and interesting.Sailor Moons transformation feels a little too delicate and princessy. I do love the explosion of ribbons since thats both graceful and powerful but her arms are noodly and its a bit strange. It honestly feels like a precursor to Princess Serenity if nothing else. I also think that as soon as we see the other scouts it might help put things in perspective. Crystal purposefully has a girlier feel than the s anime.Also as a note for your R transformation Its not that her hair decorations were on the wrong layer. When Sailor Moon opens her eyes her head goes from tilting downward to looking straight. Im pretty sure its supposed to be perspective that maybe got botched a bit. Also Its really hard not to notice the overlap when youre animating at  fps and have to have the bangs wave around a bit. ,sailormoon,cizgw9j,10,t5_2sjms

1579389,0,t1_cje8251,I have to admit that the judging for this season is very confusing. Although I agree with the first challenge win I have to take Carries side when she stated that the winning team shouldve won. I actually thought the green and black outfits were hideous. I also do agree that she was evoking passion but the judges seem to be antibullshit this season. Just this morning when I was watching the episode on Hulu I dont have a tv service I paused the video to show my BF her awesome purpleblue hair and asked him if I should dye my hair like hers. Without knowing shes a SM fan I totally have an anime feel from her. And if you think about it she totally looks like a Sailor scout especially when she wore her hair in pigtails!

I was not aware that the images were from separate series and I could definitely tell that the first two images took a lot more time which is why I expressed concern that the newest images did not match the first two.  Separately both series are wonderful but when they are put side by side the time and dedication you put into Mercury and Saturn shine through and since I was under the assumption that the newest drawings part of the same series I was kind of worried that youd given up on the series as many artists do when life and such gets in the way. So I was kind of awkwardly wondering if such was the case with you and was attempting but apparently failed to hint that I would much rather it take you a long time between drawings than for you to feel rushed to complete the series.  Again Im sorry if I floundered and that wasnt clear.   Good luck on your move and I look forward to more examples from both series!,sailormoon,cjts0yd,1,t5_2sjms

From the perspective of a person who had no clue they didnt give you much to go on except the guy getting tears in his eyes when he called out to venus. I was like wait were they?

9641425,0,t3_5ctm8h,I think it would be great if we had themed days for certain post types. Especially with the new show on break there isnt a lot of external influence to keep the content fresh and steady. We could have say a Merch Mondays open thread for people to post any new merch theyd picked up and be pretty sure they would get feedback from the community and those who dont care for merch posts could just optout. The same could go for other subjects with one day for watchalongs or readalongs another for fan art or cosplay features and so on not that posts should be forbidden on other days but the weekly thread could serve as a jumping off point.Also maybe we could add a link to the sidebar for people totally new to the series looking for where to start? Like a breakdown of proscons to rewatching the old anime amp old dub vs new dub vs sub reading the manga trying the new anime and so on written to be spoilerfree. While some spoilers are unavoidable for a series thats been popular for over two decades Ive noticed we get a fair amount of questions from potential new fans.,sailormoon,da1i5t8,2,t5_2sjms

10359924,0,t3_5o9pgl,Beyond some similarities in visual depiction I dont think theres much commonality between the characters.Evil grin? Sure!Motivations and how they handle themselves? None.Tomoe is a man with questionable scruples who becomes possessed by an alien entity. I guess depending on which cannon you are looking at  they might find some common ground in their disregard of human life. In the manga prepossession he was only interested in furthering his own work. Genetic experiments with little to no regard for the human life the experiments affected. When the daimon took over his body it only enhanced this disregard.There might be a parallel in his flagrant attitude towards humanity. But I dont think we can draw very direct comparisons.,sailormoon,dcicwl7,2,t5_2sjms
10400039,0,t1_dcl2b9u,In defense of the NYC one if its the one Im thinking of that was run by a small group of fans CosCafe NYC?  usually the cost of booking a cafe restaurant or other venue such as a hotel conference room or party space is sometimes pretty steep and the only way to recoup the cost is to charge a ticket fee. Rather than rely on sales from food and drink from anyone that comes by its less a cafe like a food truck and more like a mealshow performance. This is because food trucks and cafes make money back in the longer run supplies bought in bulk and sold over time whereas fanrun cafes are one day only  the maximum. Theyre mostly modeled after Maid Cafe in Japan and fan cafe in Korea where the focus and attraction is on the service and atmosphere rather than a traditional popup cafe where the focus is fully on the food and drink.Small cosplay popup cafes are viable and I would love to see more but they cant be free unless there are really special circumstances. Just speaking from example from staffing Southern California based popup cosplay cafes the ticket prices for entry includes venue rental venue staff and cleaning fees event insurance food cateredprepared by professionals drinks dishware decorations raffle prizes etc.  Thats the basicessential costs that must be accounted for before even booking and gauging potential attendee prices.a cosplay food truck would be pretty sweet to see. but that would be much more focus on the food rather than the service.,sailormoon,dcmwt4f,1,t5_2sjms

10993424,0,t1_deblc5x,I cant watch Crystal. The animation kills me. Kills me. Its painful to watch. So many clumsy lazy mistakes. It isnt just that I dont think Naokos style suits animation well I dont think CLAMPs does either but I do think it could have been adapted better and even that aside that doesnt excuse wonky eyes melting faces... All over the place even during scenes where there is minimal movement. I was so excited that BSSM was getting a reboot that followed the manga more closely and having a MakoJupiter with redder hair seemed like icing on the cake but I was so let down. Especially considering it was a reboot in commemoration of the th anniversary.Granted the original anime wasnt all sparkles and diamonds and there was a lot left to be desired but in this day and age there was just too much. I also had an issue with the fact that everyone especially Usagi was way way less emotive in the face. Even in the manga she made crazy faces. It felt like they were trying to focus on making everything pretty and did so at the expense of personality.,sailormoon,dee2j3n,2,t5_2sjms

I always had a bias towards Lindas version since S and SuperS were mostly on haha. She is probably the most hilarious guest Ive seen at a convention such a genuine person! Toby was a real treat as well he was so polite and willing to go along with Lindas shenanigans. I felt a tiny bit starstruck when I ended up alone with him on an elevator.I honestly never thought Id see the day that I would get to meet either of them let alone both in one weekend.
