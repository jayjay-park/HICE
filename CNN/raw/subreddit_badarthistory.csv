552878,0,t1_cg34950,Difficult to judge a twink as their portraits tend to be from when theyre middle aged but I bet Donatello was quite a shapely youth.And if we must have an Otter why not cast the net out to the Northern Renaissance and have the staggeringly pretty Durer You cant have a big gay art party without a few Germans along.,badarthistory,cg34ajl,3,t5_30g51
1807511,0,t3_2f7nk7,As I mentioned in the other thread the most terrifying thing about this is that its not a flat curve implying that some sort of thought went into this and that the peaks and plateaus are actually representative of things. Its a pity the graph is not more finely graded.,badarthistory,ck6z71n,15,t5_30g51

5512853,0,t1_cwgawxt,Theres structural issues at work as well though gallery shows are not portable or reproducible in the way that illustrations or recorded music are. You see little discussion for instance of theatre of any sort on the internet and rtheatre is hardly any more active than rcontemporaryartdespite the fact that contemporary art discussion is rather spread out and the practice and consumption are seperated and no one seems to worry about the state of theatre in the same way. EDIT Also worth noting that theatre receives just as much if not more state funding than visual arts despite being arguably much more commercially sustainable.,badarthistory,cwgbfcs,2,t5_30g51
7413919,0,t3_4guvrt,I love it when people attribute the whole perceived downfall of art thing to one specific artist. Not like abstract expressionism was you know a whole movement or anything. ,badarthistory,d2kwx5s,4,t5_30g51
7748437,0,t3_4lc2lo,The Conservatve Firing Line post is so ridiculous.gtmanaged to fool several visitors into thinking it was a masterpiece of postmodern art.Who thought this was a masterpiece? Did anyone get interviewed. Tbh given the whole proof of this incident is four photographs taken by a prankster who may have asked some of the people pictured to take part or captured them at inopportune moments this hardly seems a body blow against contemporary taste. I mean Id stop by something like that and look around because What the hell is that doing there? and Wheres the label?,badarthistory,d3mxuxm,5,t5_30g51
