22277,1,t1_cegynrp,In another decade or so and the gap should begin to close if you are to account for the planned expansions. Houston and LAs transit infrastructure are still in their infancy stages when compared to the more mature Chicago. Municipal population size alone does not make them comparable especially since Chicago came of age before the popularity of cars while HoustonLA came afterwards. And Chicagoland has  million more residents than metro Houston which accounts for the vast gulf since suburban residents are included in ridership counts I wouldnt say that Americans regard Southern transit systems as a joke especially when southern urban areas exceed the national average for transit usage. Atlanta Dallas DC and Houston will close the gap if trends towards urbanwalkable development and transit investments continue. Major new lines have opened in Houston and Dallas in recent months with more in the pipelineunder construction. I somewhat agree with your last paragraph though numerous studies have shown that residents of Southern cities want better transit. But they have to put up with corrupt politicians from gerrymandered districts. Also the Dallas stat refers to the mileage covered. ,InfrastructurePorn,cegyx1e,0,t5_2sss3

But it more has to do with there not being any space for the buses in the city centre. There is no real proper central bus station but instead its now spread out over  locations around CS. Also they want to close down the lanes of traffic and one of the bus stations in front of the Victoria Hotel so the millions of tourists every year dont have to wait for the traffic lights to cross as it gets really busy.

3291409,0,t1_cp38h7w,Interesting story  Roosevelt Island which the bridge touches upon going from Manhattan to Queens  at various times hosted an insane asylum a penitentiary a charity hospital a smallpox hospital and the like.As such there wasnt any need for much in the way of transportation.  Interestingly there was in fact just what you suggest a trolley did go over the bridge long gone and there was a building with an elevator for the doctors and staff and such long gone.  The only vehicular access was a bridge to Queens.Then along came a housing boom and residential buildings sprang up on the island in the s.  And  suddenly there were hundreds and more commuters and no reasonable public transportation to Manhattan... the subway actually runs under the island but its one of the deeper tunnel and there was no station and apparently building one was a really major undertaking.So the tram.  It was intended to be temporary but even after the new F station opened it was popular and apparently pretty cheap to operate so it remains.

In California water is now going for  per acrefoot on the spot market and a usual value thrown around is that desalinated water will cost AF.So... if the plant runs for  years and costs  billion it should produce   . million acre feet at a cost of AF. Seems legit. This is just estimate  there are significant operational costs but also value of facility doesnt go to zero on year  either.For comparison when there is a big rain storm in California it can easily drop  million acrefeet into reservoirs and many millions more across the state. In a single day the Lake Shasta reservoir accumulated  AF about  million worth of water at Ras Al Khairs prices. This is why California likes to pray for rain. ,InfrastructurePorn,cq72z8l,1,t5_2sss3

7011058,0,t3_4bn0nd,Sorry to say the plant seems inefficient   million wastetoenergy project that is producing a net  megawatts MW of electricity.   million buys a  MW natural gas power plant in Boston Oct    Calpine buys power plant for  million ... The center is a megawatt natural gasfired power plant located about  miles northwest of Boston.  The waste to energy idea was tried in Los Angeles Carver Greenfield process and it proved uneconomical to try to burn solids for fuel though methane was and is used to power the Hyperion sewage treatment plant. Shipping solids out to Arizona to use as mulch was seen as more economical than trying to burn the solids. Would love to know where DC came up with the  mm.

Transit budgets can be increased as can the efficiency of the spending. The TTC does not put a priority on any of these things they spend their entire budget on lining the pockets of those who overcharge them for the basic services that keep the TTC running. The TTC is a gravy train for those that run it. I would love to work for a company where the P amp L has no baring on my performance or job security. ,InfrastructurePorn,dgnwi2y,1,t5_2sss3
