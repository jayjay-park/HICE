465013,0,t1_cft41rj,I think Vince enjoys being the sixth man on a team like the Mavs. He has a significant role on the team and it looks like he tends to have a lot of fun when the team is playing well. You have to remember before Vince came here he was perceived as damaged goods around the league. After dealing with injuries and wanting to get away from a couple of bad teams he cultivated an image problem which we helped him fix to a degree. Anyhow I dont see him leaving the Mavs considering he has a good thing going for him here.I believe Cuban has made comments about keeping our veteran core of Dirk Marion and Carter together so I imagine thats something the Mavs are going to try to do. I would like to see us keep Marion if he will be willing to accept a deal in the  million dollar range annually but the jury is still out on that one. I dont know why the OP thinks Vince will want a deal in the  range hes getting  million a year now and just turned . If anything he should ask for the same or slightly less which I think would be a decent deal for both parties.Gortat and John Wall are not getting along well according to a few reports here and there. I think its too early to tell whether or not hell sign there. I like him so if we cant get Monroe hed be my second option as well.Calderon isnt a good fit? Hes a great distributor and is exactly what weve been missing over the past year. Our team plays well when he and Monta are both running the point together. Having  point guards on the floor is part of why our offense is as good as it is we always have two playmakers ready to create a shot for someone else.We dont have enough pieces to trade for anyone certainly not someone like Russell Westbrook who is the type of player we would not want on the Mavs. And Stephenson? Expect Indiana to make him an offer he cant refuse.Edit a word,Mavericks,cft4gd9,8,t5_2s53a

If we can figure out how to get stops I have trust in our offense.  Really hope we sit big Sam bc he cant play D and has almost no chemistry with anyone on the team. Everyone always says BWright does well because Carlisle plays him when the match ups are favored but I think hes athletic enough to be the defensive stopper we need inside.

It also implies that the Houston front office knows what theyre doing while the Mavs may not and in fact the underpinning of the whole article seems to be that the Mavs front office doesnt know what its doing while others even the Knicks do. ,Mavericks,cj15vc5,8,t5_2s53a

2026626,0,t1_ckvxa62,Morey came in to that team in  and added some great bench pieces. If they get past the Lakers that year theyd have won it all that team was so incredibly deep. Before that year the team was even more top heavy than it is now.    Okay job? Cmon man he went from  injured superstars to  top  players in roughly  years without tanking at all. That is incredible no matter which way you look at it. The team is now quite top heavy but with a fair amount of cap space and you better believe Morey already knows how hes going to spend that money. Hopefully hell spend it on quality role players and not another star but that remains to be seen. He also has an incredible knack for picking quality second rounders and late first rounders TJones will be better again this year and players like Canaan Johnson Covington and Capella can definitely contribute as early as this year.    I still dont necessarily buy that the Rockets are worse off. They replaced Parsons for half the money and got a far superior defender which is what they need. The only real loss to the Rockets is Asik. Lins numbers are very replaceable by  talented backup guards Canaan Daniels and Johnson. Im hoping that Dorsey and Adrien can go some way to replacing Asiks presense more Dorsey than Adrien tbh but Asik didnt really play a whole lot last year and they still took the th seed.    The Rockets struck out on Bosh and let Lin go for nothing really but the big loss is Asik which they still got a first rounder for. The offseason didnt go amazingly but it really isnt as bad as a lot of people are making out Morey recovered well and has signed some quality role players along with the very good developing talent that is already there. ,Mavericks,ckxfe1d,4,t5_2s53a

3344302,0,t3_2yh722,gt I was a bit on the edge with our recent play. We looked slow tired like we didnt care. Our offense was stagnant though our defense was slowly improving.Great way of putting it. This is how I felt about it.gt I went back and watched some games like Portland GSW and LAL and it really came down to shooting. Our players that usually shoot well had just been missing. We were getting open looks to Dirk on the elbow Monta in the midrange Rondo on drives Jefferson at the threepoint line we were just missing.Adding onto this the team looks dreadfully predictable. Theyre not even fun to watch right now.As for the Monta part I can only hope this is the start of him getting back on track.  in the first half is a great great sign.Great writeup though.

Coupled with Cubans remarks about the Rockets and Parsons calling Houston dirty I think they have plenty of reason to be fired up.But... I think at the end of the day any instate playoff series will create hostility. Remember the Lakers and Sacramento Kings in the early s? They hated each other. A real kind of hate. Besides I think wed be pretty immature if we were up  instead. Dont you?But its whatever our team fell apart at the worst time and they may be down  but we have been in every game.

3858370,0,t3_34l29j,I agree with the article. I understand why the mavs have done things the way they have the last few years Dirk was on his way down and they didnt have  years to develop talent around him. So every year they try to get the best veterans they can and try to win that year but it hasnt worked. Now that its evident to everyone that Dirk is no longer an overall elite player due to being a huge liability on defense we dont have many young guys.  I really hope we can keep Aminu to develop and Powell can turn into something. Dirk may never get another ring but dont mortgage the next  years of this team to try to win next year on a long shot.,Mavericks,cqw387d,3,t5_2s53a

It was a good attempt cut down by injuries and whatever you call Rondo.  So do we repeat the same thing?  Get that defensive center that compliments Dirk and other complimentary pieces and that will be enough to not crash and burn? I have no idea which way the front office is thinking.  Part of it is up to Dirk Im sure.  But he has to ask himself too if he gets hurt next season and has the sit on the side lines like Kobe would a team of Parsons and DeAndre Jordan be enjoyable to watch?I try to get stats from nba.com first before looking elsewhere.,Mavericks,crq7o90,1,t5_2s53a

4621820,0,t3_3eap7x,In Marketing you would rebrand when a product lifecycle is at its end and you want to relaunch it to monetize on it again. This doesnt really apply to the Rockets rebrand. In the case of the Rockets I think they want to make use of the fact that they have a young and very strong core which can be associated with the new Logos etc. See Bucks Warriors. So I guess to answer you question I think the Mavs would rebrand IF they fall into mediocrity for a while after Dirk and then get a good core back to become a top team.

6389322,0,t1_czfjon2,I really want to agree with you but I can honestly see the merit of LaMarcus getting the spot. Dirk is a marginally better scorer and passer by  PPG and  APG respectively but LaMarcus is significantly better at rebounding. To sum Dirk wins the ORtg battle  but LMA has an impressive  DRtg as opposed to Dirks .And Im not just a numbers guy I havent missed a single Dallas game this season and Ive seen at least half of San Antonios. The numbers reflect each fairly accurately.Dirks got  AllStar appearances  AllNBA voteins a League MVP Finals MVP and Championship trophy. Im okay with letting some young guys get a bit more of the spotlight especially ones who could use a couple more proverbial gold stars like LMA a Dallas native. Everyone knows what and who Dirk is. One more ASG would honestly just wind up a blip on the radar that is Dirks legacy the man practically invented a pivotal position in modern basketball and has the th most points out of anybody who has played in the  NBA.,Mavericks,czfwebi,2,t5_2s53a
6396823,0,t1_czgnoe2,everything you said is exactly whats wrong with our team. the only reason any of that works is because we used dirk as a crutch for so long. once he leaves you better believe we will probably look like LA or the Timberwolves unless parsons becomes a perennial allstar and whiteshite compliments him,Mavericks,czgr478,-1,t5_2s53a

6438684,0,t1_czl71w2,Yeah I say he isnt consistent because he isnt. Ive been one of his biggest supporters since he got here but lets not pretend this isnt one of his faults.I said above that he had a great January and Im not gonna pretend like he hasnt on average but shooting  every night is just plain not true. Since he came off his minute restrictions Im using the first game he played  minutes since he never played a low minutes total game after that with the exception of one  minute game randomly in the middle of a  and  minute game Chandlers shooting percentages have been all over the place. If you wanna say he was still dealing with some of his injuries just look at his numbers all throughout last year. He was even worse last year and his splits varied by like  each month. Dude is a really good player and has a lot of potential but his shot isnt consistent. Ive attached graphs since Im procrastinating studying a bit lol ,Mavericks,czlar7i,1,t5_2s53a

6457221,0,t1_czn77of,I dont think we can count on this team beating anyone right now. They barely beat a suns team that was pretty much the worse team in the entire NBA for the last month.The entire team is fatally flawed and it begins with Rick and his over reliance on the small ball lineups and free flow offense. Case in point Parsons started the game with about  points in  minutes and multiple assist on some great passes. Instead of continuing to run the offense through him we took the ball out of his hands and put it into JJB and Feltons for the remainder of the half. I think he may have gotten maybe  more shot attempts in the entire first half. The rest of the time he was camping in the corner  point line exact same shit as last season when Monta was jacking up all the shots.The offensive system is broken. Raymond Felton and JJB should not fucking be combining for more shot attempts than Parsons and Matthews. We are basically spending half of our cap space on those two guys so they can watch JJB and Felton shit up the game. And it it not just tonight either its every single night with this shit. I guarantee you if you look around the league no other team in the league has their nd and rd string point guards routinely taking more shot attempts than the supposed star players of the team do. It is a complete disgrace and absolutely no surprise the team is complete dog shit offensively when you cant even get your best players clean looks consistently.,Mavericks,czn7xbd,4,t5_2s53a

8158840,0,t1_d4x1vnr,I actually kind of like this if only because now we can hopefully finally start to see what direction this team is taking. If we get Harrison Barnes I could see us going with a closing lineup of Point GuardWesAndersonBarnesDirk quite often. We tried it a lot this year with Parsons and Dirk at the  so its not a stretch to think wed try it with Barnes. The spacing in that lineup would be phenomenal if Anderson can develop a consistent jump shot.Since there are no impact centers left on the market that we could realistically get Pau aint coming here it wouldnt surprise me to see them just go for a cheap stop gap center like Aldrich Withey or Dedmon and roll with Mejri as the starter and Dirk at center for a chunk of the game.At point guard I could see anything from Brandon Jennings to Jarrett Jack or even DWill or Felton again. Whoever it is needs to be able to penetrate run the pick and roll and score.Bring back Barea Harris and Powell off the bench and then fill the rest of the roster with young athletic guys to cover Dirks weaknesses as much as possible. Maybe take a flyer on Terrence Jones or Lance Stephenson. Or try to pry away someone like Allen Crabbe. Or if you have to scrape the bottom of the barrel with guys like Derrick Williams or Lance Thomas. Stash Hammons and FinneySmith at the end of the roster to develop.That roster may not be the best and definitely needs help at center but maybe an unforeseen trade comes up to help things along.That said all this is moot when Durant stays with OKC and the Warriors match on Barnes but its something to think about.,Mavericks,d4xej13,1,t5_2s53a

8207013,0,t1_d53e28k,I dont believe this is true. This deal is actually partially guaranteed and likely a very similar deal to Ndours. Ndour was waived meaning he didnt take up one of our  roster spots Jenkins and Mejri won out the two spots we had going into training camp but his salary did count against our cap. Offering this type of deal allows the Mavs to lock up the guy long term if he somehow ends up being a diamond in the rough with relatively low risk attached if hes a scrub. The only thing really down the drain if he doesnt pan out and gets waived is a few K of Cubans money. Pretty great we have an owner willing to throw away that type of money to invest in finding the best prospects possible.,Mavericks,d53fj89,2,t5_2s53a

8344351,0,t3_4topr4,Mavs fan from Australia  I think I first really took notice of Dirk and the Mavs in .I was a Raptors fan as a kid because of Vince Carter. But even then being young and not really getting a lot of NBA games on TV I never really got much NBA exposure. Wasnt until  and I happened to turn on Foxsports or ESPN or whatever channel was showing the NBA Finals in Oz did i see this massive white guy lighting it up. It was aweinspiring. The gracefulness the skill. It was literally like nothing Id ever seen. I had a Vince Carter and a LeBron James jersey. I thought most basketball players were big black guys that dunked on everyone.Dirk was something else. He instantly became a curiosity.Good thing for me I never saw the result of that NBA Finals.I started to pay more attention in  and to the league as a whole.Video games are the reason.Id had NBA Live  NBA Street NBA Live   and   and each time I was playing as the Raptors or the Nets because of Vince Carter.Then I took a year off between PS and PS coming out. I bought NBA Live  and at that point Vince Carter was on Orlando and I didnt like Orlando.But I remember Jason Kidd was traded to the Mavs a couple years prior  and he was my New Jersey link to Dallas  plus I remember being fascinated by Dirk.Anyway  because of video games which helped me get the NBA exposure I lacked from Australian television. I was able to learn about the league more.Ive become well studied in the league and its history and aside from all that  Dirk is still my favourite player by far. Also as a tall jumpshooting white guy I guess I related more to Dirk than LeBron Wade Kobe etc. Plus I have a thing for not necassairly following whatevers popular. Lot of casual basketball fans in Australia are Lakers or Cavs or GSW or Heat fans.Even in  I could tell this guy was for real. I started getting League Pass each year for my birthday and watched every game after school. ,Mavericks,d5klj6s,1,t5_2s53a

11183299,0,t3_5znwrj,We were a terrible team until Mark Cuban bought us and since then we havent had a losing season until now. We love the guy. Dirk is something else and one of the top  players to have ever played the game. Mvp in . Has more all star appearances than fingers. Lead us to the finals in  against the heat with shaq and Dwayne Wade. It was the most poorly officiated series weve ever seen. And we blew a  lead.  was the first year after LeBron and Chris Bosh joined the Heat to make a super team. Also the three guys in the running for mvp right now Durant Harden and Westbrook they were all on the thunder. Lastly the Lakers were two time defending champions. In  we made a historic run where we swept the Lakers who had the same record as us at the time lost only one game to the thunder and beat the super team heat in  games by playing team ball. It should go down as one of the best championship runs in history and Dirk was unstoppable. It was truly a sight to behold.,Mavericks,dezm4af,16,t5_2s53a

11561374,0,t1_dg6ewyf,Agreed. I really do like Monk or Isaac. And if thats what we end up with drafting around  or  Im fine with that. Those guys have huge upsides even if theyre not our biggest needs.Its really Markkanen I take issue with as Id much rather avoid trying to replicate Dirk.,Mavericks,dg6himi,1,t5_2s53a
11566216,0,t1_dg70rtb,gt  They gambled cause they thought Bosh was coming and then the Mavs swooped in with a sneaky as hell offer sheet.gtThe Rockets didnt let him go because they wanted to.Homeboy When Bosh didnt come they had every chance to match Dallas offer and keep him because he was restricted and they didnt. They didnt think he was worth third best player on a contender money because they didnt think he was a third best player on a contender caliber player. They had Harden and Howard locked up at that point if they thought Parsons was capable of being the third piece...they would have gladly paid! Your logic makes no sense. They had the money to sign him the opportunity to sign him and they DIDNT sign him. You have zero basis to claim that they felt he was worth that money or capable of fulfilling that role.gtAnd the Mavs only didnt resign him because his knees are shot. Yes his injuries are in part why they didnt sign him and another aspect of them not wanting him back was because they didnt like his work ethic and felt he wasnt as focused on the basketball part of his life as he was the socialmodelcelebrity aspect. this is well chronicled stuff and even further proof is how Cuban Carlisle Dirk and the entire organization constantly talk up how much they love the fact that Barnes is a real gym rat so much that its been interpreted as shots being fired at parsons. So were back to square one Both teams hes played for didnt feel confident that hes a third option on a contender caliber player and just because you the blazers and the grizzlies believe he could become that...isnt proof that he actually is or ever was that. ,Mavericks,dg71aw1,1,t5_2s53a
11567266,0,t1_dg718gx,Im down to trade. Portland has a pretty full roster with just about no upcoming FA and  sts. Im sure we could take those off their hands. Or take a teams  pick and a lower  pick,Mavericks,dg75laa,1,t5_2s53a

11586989,0,t1_dg9dy1d,I feel you but the problem with putting one mans desires and wants  regardless of how great that man is above the teams needs and wants is that it violates the TEAM concept that pro TEAM sports is built upon. Nobody says that the  World champs is Dirk...they say its the Dallas Mavs because teams are comprised of more than one man...and they are built by more than one man. It took an entire team of committed players as well as a team of scouts coaches and our GM to build that team. Dirk was the cornerstone but he didnt do it alone. Ignoring the team concept and the best interests of the team directly violates the very concept that is required to be a contender in pro team sports. ,Mavericks,dg9e51s,1,t5_2s53a
