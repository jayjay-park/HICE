389452,0,t1_cfjd543,You know actually since my post Ive been trying to listen to it constantly. And well... on some really good bass headphones it started to get to me I understood the direction it was going for. But the thing was I had to stop thinking that the remastered version was replacing the original so instead I thought of it as a cover. Its funny because had this song come out outside this game as in some other artist had covered it I would have been all for it. I felt the exact same way when I heard the FFX piano collections many years ago like why did I not feel the same love for the piano version of Besaid? It sounded nothing like the original but over time it grew on me like all of the piano tracks. So yeah sorry for the huge reply! TLDR Give it a chance think of it as a cover track and listen with bass headphones. Listen for what it is dont compare.,finalfantasyx,cfl4s5w,1,t5_304h3

968226,0,t3_25711z,At the end of the game you get a method to quick travel wherever you want instantaneously. You can backtrack on foot at most points in the story but I would just wait on it and not worry about Celestial weapon stuff until the end of the game.I didnt start collecting any of them until the final dungeon was unlocked and there will still be a lot of use for them mainly the arena. Postgame content feels like it takes almost as long as the main game to complete.As for thunder dodging you should wait until you get a no encounter weapon lategame and then use the crater method so the bolts are more predictable which will add to your reaction time since you will know right when it will strike instead of it being random.,finalfantasyx,checi8v,6,t5_304h3

3903064,0,t1_cr0g6xk,Thanks for all the new details!My whole problem is that we had such a nice but also sad story with FFX. To make us gamers happy they made the sequel. Probably not the best game but it gave us a happy ending and everything was fine.And then I heard about the audio drama and the novella and it just destroyed everything they built up over the games which sinks the games to insignificance. Yuna behaves like she was when we first met her Tidus is again not really alive and everyone else behaves like they were never friends before. And Sin is still there. Yeah.,finalfantasyx,cr16mb2,1,t5_304h3

4357507,0,t3_3ax83p, Auron says that he rode Sin to Zanarkand I cant remember if its before or after you fight Yunalesca. Tidus never learns that Zanarkand is out in the ocean and the only time he communicates with Jecht is right before he kills him.,finalfantasyx,csgtom5,1,t5_304h3
4357579,0,t3_3ax83p,Major spoilers below... I dont think its ever specified how Auron figures out how to get to Dream Zanarkand. The only explanation I can think of is he found out about it after returning to Yunalesca after Braska defeated Sin. She might have even revealed it to the trio before turning Jecht into a fayth.You say that Jecht would have gone back if he could but Auron tells Tidus that Jecht did a lot of maturing during the pilgrimage. I think that Jecht genuinely wanted to help Spira by bringing a Calm by the end of it even if it meant not being able to go home.The same goes for Tidus. By the time he gets to Zanarkand he cares more about ending the cycle and saving Yuna than going home. Although its worth noting that Auron didnt sail out there. He rode atop Sin and was presumably only able to do so because he was an unsent. Tidus wouldnt be able to ride Sin while alive.As for Sin destroying Dream Zanarkand Jecht has some control but not much at this point. Youd think hed be able to resist at least attacking his home but the mindless Yu Yevon only knows that he is meant to destroy large technologically advanced cities and Dream Zanarkand is pretty much the holy grail of technology at this point in time.,finalfantasyx,csgtz4m,1,t5_304h3
4753044,0,t3_3g0ks0,Im in the same boat but near the end game. I started with the expert grid. I feel like it gave me a lot of freedom in the early game where it matters more. For late game it depends on how much HPMP you want. If you want  HP then its easier to get there with the standard because it has more nodes overall. Im aiming for  HP and autoPhoenix. ,finalfantasyx,ctto04s,1,t5_304h3

5136842,0,t3_3kmj0i,That sounds like a very weird bug.Normally you only get a game over if all members of your active party are KOdpetrifiedejected and no one has escaped and youre not in a safe zone like the monster arena or a fiend info panel you shouldnt have gotten a game over unless Lulu died or was petrified or was ejected from the battle.Having an aeon die btw also does not give you a game over it basically just dismisses the aeon and you cant resummon it for a while until youve fought  battles or touched a save sphere.,finalfantasyx,cv56j4y,1,t5_304h3
5197346,0,t3_3jfyaz,Read they released the patch and immediately bought the PS Remaster. This game holds up so well its just awesome. Still one of my favorite RPGs ever.  Love switching between the Original and Arranged soundtracks in each area too.Two audio complaints There should be a rd sound option to have it loop from Original to Arranged so you can hear both as you play in each area and add more variety. Also you should be able to lower the voice volume its just too loud when I turn up the volume to better hear the fantastic music.,finalfantasyx,cvch24z,1,t5_304h3
5769448,0,t3_3u5q7l,My only issue with the worldstory of this game is how Mouse over for Spoilerss Tidus tries to convince Yuna to put her own life over the lives of countless others. Shes willing to sacrifice herself in order to save hundreds? thousands? millions?

From my experience when cheats are used in a Steam game all of the achievements are disabled regardless of whether the specific cheat activated would be used to assist in whichever ach. you were going for.
