Sort of jerking over this idea that your purchases have to last  years to be worth your money.As for fit its more fussing over getting the perfect fit  or  off the sleeve perfectly no collar gap tshirt ending between the waistband and the bottom of the zipper stuff like that. Fit is important but I guess what Im rebelling against is the idea of perfect or conservative fit a lack in experimenting in less conventional fits etc.,malefashion,ceu2opy,3,t5_2seq5

Ive got a couple books on design that I pirated for sources that I can link you to once I get to my computer. My recommendation would be to buy some cheap muslin and some patterns and play around with those until you feel comfortable with the basics of sewing and following patterns then you can go do your own thing. The hardest part is probably going to get a pattern down that has the right fit and look. Sewing with practice is fairly easy. Its pretty easy to figure out what you want to make and its pretty easy to find the right kinds of fabrics. But making a good pattern is pretty hard. ,malefashion,cf8v91n,6,t5_2seq5

They are a trend within themselves and its amazing that its been rationalised to such a degree without it popping up. People have always dressed stylishly similar to this without being so obnoxious about it. I also dont think fashion is at all about being an individual but it is indeed a major byproduct. Rather I think its about embracing oneself it just so happens that everyones an individual.

I meant it in that some guy decides to dress up like the pope and walk around town but is certainly not the pope because its very easy to falsify the statement Is this person the pope?In my opinion the appropriation of the church is possible.  If I can appropriate Native American religion by wearing a headdress then I can also appropriate the Catholics by wearing pope clothes.  Its roughly similar and I cant think of a perfect Catholic version.  Furthermore Im using the pope because there is only one pope.  We can falsify the pope.  We cant falsify simply by looking at someone if a white person grew up in Africa helped people in Africa etc.  Context can be important to determine if they are appropriating clothing simply because they like it and I see no problem in this or because it means something to them a gift from an African family they once helped for instance or even to remember their trip to Africa.,malefashion,ch2ehc1,2,t5_2seq5

This implies that readers lurkers of malefashion have a pretty clear idea of what they like and dont like but dont own whatever it is that they like or are too lazy to post their amazing fits resulting in a lack of fits that people are actually willing to upvote. The trend seems to continue past page  as well but Im too lazy to count more.Essentially people are holding others to a higher standard than they themselves are able to provide. People are saying this is ass to people posting content and then post their own content and receive the exact same feedback. Its possible like someone else mentioned that this higher standard was set when more people actually bought and rocked cool stuff but these people have by and large moved on while the standard has stayed the same. It sucks but its reality.IMO people should chill the fuck out with their negative feedback if theyre unable to post anything better.

2765872,0,t3_2rqx08,Im getting real tired of people looking over my shoulder and asking me what I am shopping for now when in reality  of the time I am just browsing. I watch Grailed Ebay and stores a lot for good deals. When I see a deal sometimes I make a low offer and sometimes if I think its a good enough deal I buy. Before I made a goal to dress nicer I owned one pair of jeans and a few shorts. All of my clothes were from the Ambercrombie era in terms of styling. A few days ago someone asked me why I look at so many pics of dudes as if it was some sort of implication of something else. I glared at him then later when hes looking at a football website I asked him the same thing. The people I work with saw what I paid for a pair of CP achilles  new condition and now around the workshop everyone is convinced that I am just waisting money. I dont own a pair of white low tops and they all swear that you can get superior quality in the  dollar range. They even told my boss they think I might need financial counseling and he mentioned it to my direct superior to mention it to me. Their almost all married or the kind of guys that wear tshirt and or cargo athletic shorts. Im in the military so everyone rocks the standard bro style. I am not even paying but around  dollars on the clothes I buy but the consensus is that I am a poor decision maker because I am buying things they arent interested in. I got into a discussion about clothing quality with a coworker and made an analogy about people that are convinced that McDonalds burgers will suffice and how a chef would compare that to garbage. The basic premise of my conversation was that its all about personal choice and about detail. I guess the points I made were too rational because the subject was quickly changed.  Im getting real tired of their shit. Just had to get that off my chest. ,malefashion,cnigw71,28,t5_2seq5
2781232,0,t3_2rv5iv,Im pretty sure thats just a shorthand for out in the world. I think i would probably be taken aback a bit of I saw some of our more ninjay subscribers on the bus or at the store. More power to them but I think its a legitimate criticism to tell someone that they look bizarre and out of place even if their clothes fit well and are all supposedly fashionable. I think that part of fashion is to blend in as well as stand out and that finding the perfect balance between those things is the ultimate goal so I will make criticisms to this effect that are similar to the ones you are complaining about. If you think that fashion is about radical statements and looking like a Japanese animated super villain or a Sith Lord then thats okay too but I may mention that the look may be a bit over the top. If you disagree then please tell me so I dont try to cramp your style and your freedom of expression that is the whole point of what were doing here but I think that those opinions should be equally enshrined if respectfully made. ,malefashion,cnk7t8r,1,t5_2seq5

Plus I fucking hate injokes and memes and whatever and sufu seems full of that stuff at least their own brand of it anyways.SZ i dont ever frequent so I cant comment on that either.Checked out Caretags awhile ago and found the fits to just be boring as hell with  inspiration. I dunno again that might have just been my experience.fa is just fucking terrible. all about superiority nothing about substance or aesthetic. I mean during the mens shows in Paris in January I think they only had one thread on it and of course it was Rick. Anyways that place is a pit.What I dig about this sub is that its sorta all over the place? Ive heard people say its mean or critical or whatever but I really havent found that to be the case. Its pretty relaxed compared to other boards i think at least the ones ive visted more frequently.,malefashion,cobhoee,12,t5_2seq5

3492944,0,t3_3093s7,Ive never thought about the working out is modern couture quote that much but Im now realizing that its really insightful. Although I could be wrong I feel like were living in one of the first times where being able to consciously choose ones body type is widespread. Of course shaping ones body is timeconsuming and requires knowledge that some people ex. those in  poverty likely dont have but it seems like people can now use their bodies like clothes are used you can convey the image you want to.I think the perfect body largely depends on what youre going for. Maybe you want to look intimidating get ripped. Maybe you want to look comfortable and inviting stay as thin as you can without being toned. Maybe you want to look gentle and sensitive be a waif. If people feel happy about their bodies and dress to them I feel like most people can look cool.Likely because I grew up as such a fat kid Ive always considered my own body ideal to be as skinny as possible. With my more recent interest in working out though Ive come to appreciate having muscle and now find my ideal closer to ottermode.,malefashion,cpqf5g4,3,t5_2seq5

This seemed to be a quick recap of why Martin Margiela matters in fashion history. I was hoping for a little deeper dive either in unknown facts about the maison or in commentary about his influence.Ultimately this seems like a  intro course to the house. Yet another PR move by Only the Brave similar to all their cutesy promo videos appointing Galliano as CD etc to justify keeping the maison around despite dwindling profits.

4350273,0,t1_csfkguy,really just depends on what youre looking for. long legs and broad shoulders sounds like youve got a models proportions and that really means you can probably wear whatever the fuck you want. skinny jeans could look great if youre looking for an SLP look. id break it down into sections legs feet torso head. These are the main areas you can affect. Heres a tall dude who is doing the yohji thing. chunky feet. wide legs. squarish torso. works great.this guy kinda has the opposite slim legs big hat cropped top with layering. then theres this that kinda does both big furry shorts chunky shoe and ankle but fitted torso and no hair. they all work in different ways so i hesitate to say theres a rule outside of the ones you set for yourself. RO stuck looks great on skinny tall people because rick is himself skinny and tallish and his clothes ranges from tight ass jeans to baggy basketball shorts.  edit this guy is another example of moving the linesproportions. you can tell hes slim and taller but the jacket moves his waistline super high up. then hes got these blocky shorts that anchor everything and then skinny stick legs. we cant see his feet but using the above experimental options he could probably punctuate everything with big fat sneakers and look rad. ,malefashion,csg0as6,2,t5_2seq5

4703132,0,t1_ctmxxwn,Regarding monetization I know theyve tried starting a consignment service twice because I participated both times. Both times it more or less flopped...I know I saw my items sell for substantially less than I couldve sold them for myself and the ease of use of Grailed is selfdefeating for a consignmentbased model.    Its Aruns second company and he got Y Combinator funding from the first one WakeMate so I wouldnt be surprised if he has both the liquidity and appetite to run in the red for a while longer. I could see something similar to consignment working in the future some partnerships with stores something like what TheRealReal and even MyHabit often do where youll see stores liquidate excess inventory or maybe even something like what SF does with some kind of membership fees for big sellers. Either that or its a pure acquisition play as others have suggested.,malefashion,ctnd8d9,3,t5_2seq5

However since my wardrobe has done a complete overhaul since the beginning of . In  I was VERY into prep. Being Swedish though I dont live there it also felt quite natural to me its very similar to how my relatives dress. I filled my wardrobe with OCBDs chinos boat shoes even got a KJPbelt.However in the last year Ive moved away from that style and Ive been working towards streetwear and realised I look great in SLPstyle clothing because of my build and very defined cheekbones.I still wear a lot of the things I bought during this period as its great to wear for parties or any event which is semi formal. Though day to day I prefer my new style.Pics of me from   So this year has consisted of a lot of experimentation while it may not sound like anything special I got my first pair of skinny jeans and chelsea bootsMy favourite purchases are CDG x Converse Sandro leather jacket Nike floral free .  Sadly I never wear these. Parajumpers GobiI also just noticed the amount I spend on clothes has skyrocketed. However Im enjoying it so it isnt too bad.Here are some pics of when I was just starting to change my style so they arent anything special.  Im actually not sure how to go from here however Im hunting for the perfect pair of black leather chelseas. In an ideal word Id be able to find exactly what style I like and right now Im leaning towards the Hedi Slimanes rocker look.

6701778,0,t3_47da8z,Buncha good stuff on Grailed that Id love for somebody else to buy so I dont have to think about it anymore  SFTM Boots in   Yang Li Monk Boots in   Incarnation jacket for  shipped  BV chelseas somehow sitting at   Ann D Contrast Sole boots    Also after buying about  illfitting leather jackets over the last year Im wondering whether I should just get an MTM Falcon despite the fact that in theory I can get  solid Grailed leathers for the price of  Falcon. The only brand Ive ever found that fits me well off the rack is BLK DNM but Id rather get something a bit higherquality. Ive got big arms and shoulders and a super skinny body so anything Japanese has always been too tight in the arms and most other stuff is too loose in the body    Im also thinking about dress boots. I want to either get some slightly chunky chelseas or beefy but sleek laceups. I know what my grails are  Mr. Hare Sonnys for the former and Yang Li for the latter but Mr. Hares quality is sometimes pretty iffy from what Ive heard and I cant come close to affording Yang Lis. I might just get some black Aldens.    Also I totally dont need them but I absolutely love a lot of the Rider x Sassetti line. The Bernards and Antelmes are phenomenal.    Finally I got some Julius boots Theyre dope but Im not sure how well theyre gonna wear in.,malefashion,d0cisqz,5,t5_2seq5

8599519,0,t3_49zokj,Hey man been going through your fits with Margielas as I just acquired some for a steal! I always cuff my pants or crop my pants to fit slightly above my shoes. With the Margielas however they seem to fit just a tad longer and are more narrow making them really pop. Size US  maybe their just too big to wear like so? P.S we have like the same eyebrows dude how do you groom them? I feel mine to be too bushy and slightly long but I dont really know what to do in terms of plucking..Thanks man if you get a chance to help. ,malefashion,d6gj6r8,1,t5_2seq5

10646796,0,t1_dde2yl4,You didnt know about caretags at your supposed level? Damn. Its part of that old guard of fashion forums but its stuck around through time compared to SuFu and shit. Its that classic discussion board shit. The variety of fits is alright but the knowledge and discussion is top there. Older audience than Streetwear and shit. Just saw your edit switching from mobile to laptop. Some of the posts are lagging but theres a few that are pretty up to date. Its about the same post rate in WDYWT threads as you get post frequency in this sub.Again you need to get it through that I wasnt criticizing your grammar. I wanted to make sure I got you so I can address your shit properly and not make assumptions about what youre speaking on. Yeah. I split off into another account thats got the same name as other social media shit in case I wanted to fuck with it. James Marriott style. One sub the sneaker trading one I didnt even finish setting up the CSS cuz I got busy with life. The other I got bored with. Like I said I run my inflammatory shit off here now. Instagram is a great style. People will talk down about certain elements because of two reasons Hype and the designers. You can see the first one if youre around a culture long enough. People love shit when its underground but the second it gets popular people will hate it. I think its a good style tarnished by peoples desire to be bleeding edge. As for the designers go to places like caretags and see how they talk about the current rocker SLP aesthetic. Even though it looks good people are beginning to bash it due to how Hedi jacked old rocker trends and similar sentiments. Nobodys evaluating fashion based on the looks theyre examining the culture of it instead.And its not about personal style being better or worse than trends. Its that if you dont keep up with trends to some degree people wont think youre fashionable. Being fashionable is tied to a degree to trends. Too far behind begins to look dated to us. You have to incorporate them to not look behind.Everyone knows that Raf isnt about OffWhite. Hes been no commenting subtle dissing the brand in interviews for a minute. Asking about haircut or jeans recommendation isnt not being able to think for yourself its advice. Sometimes you need a second opinion Im glad youre able to walk into stores and try on different brands or have the cash to take Ls on purchases that didnt work out.I just have a high hairline.

11146664,0,t3_5z5s5x,No Name | HampM | HampM | EC CollectionsEverything was thrifted except for the sweater which in a sudden turn of traditional events I TOOK FROM MY GIRLFRIEND! I thought the colors played well together and was initially going to keep everything subdued and let the jacket do the talking. However after reaching out to udomkennedy for some advice I decided to go big or go home. I definitely drew some inspiration from Gucci with their really loud pieces and I really enjoyed how this one turned out. As Im sure you can tell Ive been more experimental with my style as of late. I wouldnt say thats indicative of an entire stylistic shift however I have recently been asked a lot to reflect on my style and what it means to me to enjoy this hobby. This made me realize that I was perhaps taking it a bit too seriously and that I was straying away from the care free fun that has always been the root of why I enjoy all of this.If youd like to see some older fits check out my InstagramCheers boys,malefashion,devgnsf,22,t5_2seq5

I part my hair above my right pupil while its wet push it back and apply a leave in conditioner. When its almost done drying I take a minuscule amount of a claywax hydrid and run it over the surface of my hair then use whatever is left on my fingers to lift the roots of the top of my hair.

Youre typically going to be following one color pallette Greys Blues maybe browns with a standard tailored fit.You also do have some freedoms with shirt and tie color you can create interesting combos just making sure it all compliments each other. My favorite is lavender under a charcoal suit.That being said you can totally look into different fabrics and textures of the suit. Things like wool or tweed and herringbone or tonal pinstripes. I think suits like this are really cool although maybe edging towards a little less professional than intended.And of course tons of freedom with shoes! ,malefashion,dgj3o5c,5,t5_2seq5
