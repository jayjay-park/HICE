2844013,0,t3_2so3yq,You said you tried the police already but here are some numbers for Beaverton Police anyway Id try the nonemergency line Further if they are in a maintained park Id try THPRDs Park Patrol  I used to work for THPRD and the Park Patrol is actually pretty good about keeping an eye on things and addressing concerns if you have any. Good luck!,beaverton,cnrd2k2,3,t5_2utsp

I called PGE and they werent helpful at all they couldnt or wouldnt even tell me if this was average for my apartment complex.

8743386,0,t3_4zrznp,Cedar Hills? I got pulled over for pretty much the exact same scenario over there. Yes plead no contest and take the traffic school. You pay the class fee  and  to the court and the judge will dismiss the ticket. It will not reflect on your parents insurance.Source I am currently doing this for my first ticket in Beaverton as well.,beaverton,d6ykr87,5,t5_2utsp
9246536,0,t3_56y1nn,I take the train most mornings from Beaverton Creek to Pioneer Courthouse Square at around am. Nearly every morning Im standing some mornings Ill grab a seat but I dont count on it.One thing I see often though is people just cram into the space in front of the doors. USE THE AISLES. I cant tell you how many times I got on and the door was so crowded you could hardly move when there is plenty of space just feet away in the aisle. Just get on and ask people to politely move out of the way I do this in conjunction with pointing in my desired direction because often Ill encounter those who dont speak English no big deal. while you move into the aisle. I had plenty of breathing room this morning while I watched people continue to squish next to each other in front of the door. Not only is it slightly dangerous but also uncomfortable. No bueno!,beaverton,d8o2e0g,2,t5_2utsp
