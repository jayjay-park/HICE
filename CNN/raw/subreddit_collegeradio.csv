Instudio we still have  CD players hooked up to the board but everything is gone the cassette player was taken out a few years ago and the turntables were given away to DJs on a firstcome firstserve basis last semester.We dont even have a physical music library anymore it was turned into a DJ lounge area we got rid of records about  or  years ago and CDs about  to  years ago.,collegeradio,cuhskau,2,t5_2qlbu

Its really tough to make the time to listen to every track you are going to play. But definitely try to build a clean library and add songs to your phone or iPod to listen to and check before going to air. Have fun!!! ,collegeradio,cv9z2uj,2,t5_2qlbu
