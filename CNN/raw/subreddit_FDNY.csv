What this means is that you sign a waiver that anything happens relating to you condition and they will not pay. Thats if your department will approve it.That here is a big one to get candidates thrown out. They check us every year to make sure. I would advise anyone against a exclusion. Anything they can use to not pay you. ,FDNY,cv4l9zp,1,t5_2t7mx

7958974,0,t3_4o6zcz,The alertbot is still pretty new and Im working through the kinks. Im hearing what you said from a few people and Im working on finding a medium between keeping people informed and not destroying their new feed.The bot only works when my home computer is on connected to the internet and logged into the alertbot account. When I left for work I turned off my computer. I came back and turned it on and it posted every event from the past day and a half all at once  thats why it flooded everyones news feed. If you could bear with me for a bit longer itd be much appreciated.,FDNY,d4anwm8,2,t5_2t7mx
