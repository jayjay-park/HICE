10899059,0,t3_5vjnq8,With Healthcare IT arent these servers hosting software suites from various vendors that would dictate the operating system? For example if your virtual host server is running a GE software package doesnt GE have to tell you if its windows  or Windows  or Linux? Isnt the OS considered part of their offering and their responsibility to support especially if it is a medical device under the guidance of the FDA That would be my concern in your ability to carve out a niche as described. I think too many hospital systems would push that back on their vendors referencing support agreements. HIPAA becomes a catch all for this type of thing as an operating system that is no longer supported will no longer have appropriate security controls as required by law. ,healthcareIT,de45shi,1,t5_2soci
