1185665,0,t1_ci1i7zg,Thats a pretty common myth. Since they have hair not fur Shih Tzus dont shed like other dogs do but they do in fact shed. I brush mine a lot and that is when all the hair gets everywhere for me. Also I was mostly referring to the chows I think they are chows? My best friend has one and she is constantly fighting fur.  ,Shihtzu,ci308dq,2,t5_2skz5
1351656,0,t1_cilcn25,Wow this is so amazing. Do they all move in a herd or do they each venture around the house on their own?,Shihtzu,cilpzio,5,t5_2skz5

Please deal with it.Most of the time its not there anymore but shes not taking the chance.,Shihtzu,cv3o9uv,2,t5_2skz5
5523361,0,t3_3qqtfe,I have a male and all the guys I know always give me crap for making him look like a girl.  When Im out and about people always assume he is a girl.  He loves being groomed though and whenever I get done doing his hair he prances around like he knows he was just made pretty.,Shihtzu,cwhnqcr,5,t5_2skz5
6933169,0,t3_4ansl1,They are cuddly to a point where its almost too much lol! Mine hasnt left my side since i got him in . He sleeps in my bed hangs out with me in the bathroom jumps on my chest on the couch wakes me up the same way in bed. I find Shih Tzu are very people oriented and almost need to be around people all the time. They really are the ultimate cuddle dog. ,Shihtzu,d1278hl,2,t5_2skz5
7025374,0,t3_4bqqx5,My  year old likes to go to bed curled up in a ball but when I wake up shes on her back between two pillows with her paws up. She has those adorable floppy ears with her upside down face too,Shihtzu,d1cog9a,1,t5_2skz5

7631174,0,t3_4ju3sd,Rocket is a handsome mister! And his size seems fine to me  my neighbours Tzu is YO and about  lbs another is a  lbs fullgrown male while my girls around  lbs on a good day. I guess what Im trying to say is the bigger they are the more of them to love! Give your Rocket a hug for me? Hes a cutie!,Shihtzu,d39mfzd,1,t5_2skz5

11097228,0,t1_deptq0m,Theyre both red heelers. Theyre faces look a little smooshed because they werent totally amused. Hahahaha. The combination was definitely interesting when we added our first ACD. We got him as a pup and he was relentless with his pursuit of her. He just wanted to play with her sooo badly. We were worried at first but getting Maggie her own crate and giving her alone time solved it. We got the female ACD at  months so completely different experience. Mika is so polite with Maggie. However Ive noticed Maggie Shih Tzu is much more lenient  and cuddly with Max male acd. Maybe because she raised him and taught him his doggy manners? Either way theyre all a riot. Best of both worlds!,Shihtzu,depv0eg,2,t5_2skz5
11168102,0,t3_5smtsv,Toughest part is trimming between the eyes. I have a small trimmer almost like a beard sculptor for dogs. I slowly creep up behind them preferably with an assistant to distract them grab the chin and swipe up in one fell swoop. After that they dont seem to mind the rest. Its all in the wrist! ,Shihtzu,dexw580,1,t5_2skz5
