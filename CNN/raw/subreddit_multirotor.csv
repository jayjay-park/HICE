3423912,0,t1_cpijdnx,Keep in mind with that frame your sacrificing durability for weight savings. These  frames tend to take a beating so I always recommend getting one with a k carbon fiber frame and mm arms if possible. You can always use the battery that suits your mood small for agility and large for exploring or filming.,multirotor,cpijuod,3,t5_2x4ur

3892519,0,t1_cqw2ekv,Theyre not preprogrammed in the same sense as the CXs though. The CX you just click the right stick and pick a direction and it completes it almost flawlessly. For the Hubsan you have to be moving in a direction and quickly change to the opposite direction. Even then it will flip and sometimes not be able to level quickly enough if you dont have enough altitude. Definitely get the hubsan btw. Amazing and much better for outside flying. ,multirotor,cqzzc37,1,t5_2x4ur
5171978,0,t1_cv8mjxj,So here is my dilemma.  While I do want a mini I dont want the naze fc unless I have a dedicated mini for acro.  I think that a mini is the right choice for a first quad because of the sturdiness while learning  however I really really want to play around with the programmable aspects of apm like follow me mode loitering etc.  My plan is to make a mini with the new micro . apm fc see my reply to the other users post is that highly unadvisable? ,multirotor,cv9ewe4,1,t5_2x4ur
5228649,0,t3_3mkw7n,If your not an experience pilot Id consider the DAL  props.  They tend to be very durable.A solder sucker or solder wick will likely come in useful for undoing soldering mistakes.Some awg wire for attaching your XT connector to your PDB. Or get XT with pigtails.You have a buzzer for your quad but will likely find a lipo voltage alarm to carry around with your batteries useful.Id consider a parallel charging board so you can balance charge or storage on all your batteries at the same time. Some heavy duty velcro on top of the Velcro straps are also pretty standard on  quad builds. So you velcro your battery and your mobius to the frame and then strap them down on top of it.Make sure your nylon standoffs are not too tall because you will be stacking the flight controller on top of the PDB of your motors will be spinning backwards as a result your propeller nuts will tend to loosen over time due to the reverse rotation as well as vibration.  Replacing the included cone shaped nuts with some regular M nylon locking nuts will keep your propellers from coming off mid flight and will shave off a bit of weight.zip ties come in useful for various things on your quadcopter depending on how you choose to get the job done. I use them in combination with some spacers to get my tilt going on my board camera as well as a means to keep my DRII antennas upright and clear from getting chopped up in my props as well as for cable management.,multirotor,cvg8rpy,1,t5_2x4ur
5253064,0,t1_cvfx0oo,Well the Nano Qx is one quad that I have been seriously considering. Id like to know how long does it take to charge and how is flight on agility mode?,multirotor,cvj6l0c,2,t5_2x4ur

6973200,0,t3_4b6lxe,Absolutely mission planner has built in antenna tracking. Download mission planner and look under the initial setup gt optional hardware gt antenna tracker. Use it for radio or video! Use the APM wiki for details.I have never used the antenna tracker but I love my APM boards. What are you talking about old! These are still some of the better FCs that you can get without spending a whole week of pay!,multirotor,d16qzsj,1,t5_2x4ur

7291872,0,t3_4f97bw,Do you have the FC mounted with some kind of dampening material ? I had one go nuts on me in a similar fashion completely cured when I mounted the FC using some double sided foam for vibration dampening.,multirotor,d271c0f,1,t5_2x4ur
7504848,0,t1_d2ptj4k,Quick correction for anybody doing a quick search and coming across this answer. PPM will come out of channel . RSSI comes out of channel . If youre not using telemetry just use channel  for  channels.,multirotor,d2v9go1,1,t5_2x4ur
7608416,0,t3_4eincq,I got roped into graupner radiosnobody around me uses them sells them understands them but I make due by finding the smallest lightest cheapest recievers and decasingheatshrinking them.  Maybe that could work for you tooQuanum v goggles were just a starter goggle. Surely Id get new fancy slick ones. Nope.  Im never leaving these.   a variety of antennas for each flying situation  immersion patchaomway helical aomway rhcp..ect was a big first step to good video. But ultimately Dual diversity Rx upgrade made a massive difference.  Who is excited to rip apart headplays for diversity upgrade? Oh or add  div modules to  doms? ,multirotor,d371cr2,1,t5_2x4ur

10122070,0,t3_5ku4mb,The best thing you can do right now is just stick time.  Start buying replacement parts now.    How far do you want to progress  which direction do you want to go?  LOS? AP?  FPV?If you think youll want to build your own quad sometime in the future best to start researchingbuying stuff now.  Building is a slow process with lots of mistakes to make and waiting for shipping from everywhere.  Youll find that youll top out on what your current aircraft is capable of in terms of speed and maneuverability pretty quick.  In angle mode the way your quad flies you can get away by just using yaw to turn.  If youre flying forward it is a little smoother to yawroll in the same direction but mostly the autolevel takes care of this for you.  If you start flying in rate also called acro mode youll have to learn to yawroll in the same direction this is called coordinating turns in order to get the quad to do what you want it to.,multirotor,dbqwvbn,2,t5_2x4ur
10557190,0,t3_5r6838,They are simonk A escs with some ready to sky  kV motors. I used a s battery with these. This was my first flight too  One thing I did wrong was not remap the motors so when I took off it flipped around I disarmed the quad and then I noticed smoke coming from these two. The others seem perfectly fine though. Only thing that I thought it might be was me shorting out the motor windings so I switched out to nylon nuts but havent gotten new escs to test with.,multirotor,dd4rz7z,1,t5_2x4ur
