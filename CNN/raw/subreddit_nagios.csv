2402304,0,t1_cm8bgm6,gt To preface this is a project that I was gifted when I joined the team. This was me two years ago.  Please feel free to reach out.  Ive been where you are now.Just so you know the Wizards are additive.  If you specify a hostname thats already in Nagios the Wizard will add services to that host.  I had to ask a developer about this years Nagios conference its not described clearly in their documentation.  I really only use the RouterSwitch wizard to get bandwidth stats  of what I do is in the CCM.  I use a free NagiosXI instance to validate and test new checks which I then move to the production host.gt Again ideally what we would be looking for is something that would allow any member of my team to click on a host and clearly see all the services configured for it the check times for each and whowhen notifications are sent out.As AfterSpencer suggested apply services to Hostgroups where possible.  I also suggest keeping some type of documentation that clearly shows what checks are applied where.  I made a dashboard with the notepad plugin and update that when changes are made to clearly show whats being checked on what groups.  Really think about your naming conventions and police that shit if others are configuring Nagios as well.  Its important to have a solid naming convention that is documented so others can tell whats going on at a glance.gt I did not know anything about templates though. So with a template would I be able to apply the template with updated settings after the fact? Such as create a template then apply it to all of my webservers that are already reporting to nagios to change the notifications generated by service checks?Settings on a host take precedence over a host template.  Its worth it to specify as many settings in a template as possible and its worth it to stop now and cleanup what you have to do this so your life is easier later on when you need to change something on  hosts.  When I make a host I give it a Name IPDNS GEO Coordinate for the Google earth plugin under notes in misc and a template.  All my check settings alert settings and the misc settings are applied in the template.If youre not using Parent Child Relationships and Dependencies you should.  Study up on the host reachability logic and how dependencies work  This can get really complex in large environments I make high level visio diagrams of the dependencies and parent child relationships for my own sanity...I wouldnt use NagiosQL.  NagiosXI is fine for what youre trying to do when you figure out the best practices.,nagios,cm8mtcz,2,t5_2rtzi

4437420,0,t3_3bvu1n,First check you apcahcesitesenabled directory for your nagios.conf to make sure your cgibin is correctly directed. The error that your getting at the tail of your access log is its missing the direction to the directory. you are running on an older version of Core  Im on .. so its a little different but thats where i would start first. ,nagios,csq0sqv,2,t5_2rtzi

10617398,0,t3_5rvlb6,I dont think Nagios is the right product to do self healing for networks.I could see it being used for self healing for other things service restarts machine reboots etc.. Youd need a little bit more inspection of whats happening on the network to truly diagnose and selfheal.  We utilize an sflow collector to dive into our traffic and weve built toolsschedules to selfheal the network in the event of various things.  An example might be If theres any TCP traffic in ZoneA disable the switch port thats conducting the TCP traffic.  Another example.. if a port is pushing more traffic than it should rate limit that port down to  or something.  We also detectmitigate DDoS attacks this way.,nagios,ddb3rkw,2,t5_2rtzi
11275047,0,t1_ddry17i,i have about  times the services x  hostsvms on less gear than you. what does your nagios.cfg look like ? what does your root service config look like ? these could impact performance. its very easy to say check these as fast as you can well nagios will do just that   with as much resources as it takes to do that..also are we talking spikes or sustained ?,nagios,dfa0dml,1,t5_2rtzi
