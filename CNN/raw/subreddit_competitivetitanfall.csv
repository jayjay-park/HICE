367074,0,t1_cfisv4n,gtI competed heavily and on a high level in multiple games. What my ego doesnt need is for you to believe that.Then you would realize half the stuff you said is not true. People rage quit broke rules all day long in CS and other competitive classics. You couldnt trust gamers then and you cant trust them now. gtThis game will not be competitive for the reasons I stated aboveWhat reasons? If there is a group of players who plays and they make leagues and ladders its competitive. It might not be Quake status competition but they will be competing none the less. gtAgain you dont have to see the light. What light? You are being an elitist in your eyes if its not CS it can fuck off. gtItll be when youre playing TitanFall wishing it were something its not or when you admit embarrassingly in your head that you actually used the word now mildly sacred competitive in connection with a game like BF.Why is that embarrassing? If the players are having fun and playing against each other is that not what competitive gaming is all about. gtYou strike me as someone who has been a part of actual competitive communities but as someone who equally cannot admit that the essence from which they were born does not exist any longer.What does not exists? You have not mentioned anything. Teams and players compete in games without built in ladders and ELO systems its not a requirement. Its just a huge help. Had we had systems like that  years ago my god would competing off been  steps easier. gtSo please. Put your dick away.The only one dick measuring is you as you try to knock anything thats not CS.,competitivetitanfall,cfit9fn,0,t5_2yvm2

562921,0,t3_20kmgg,This just seems like an arbitrary list of stuff you dont like. For example you want to ban antititan weapons titans are giant walking map control machines without a way to deal with them the team that gets the titans first is just going to stomp. You want to ban the smart pistol which really isnt that strong vs pilots unless youre sitting in a corner and if you do that in a competitive match youll just straight up lose. I dont think we should ban anything until weve had time to test it.,competitivetitanfall,cg49db9,1,t5_2yvm2

573155,0,t3_20m3v1,Great post. I did not even think of that CTF issue before. Wow that is pretty unfair for competitive matches.Perhaps every  total flag caps swap sides up until someone hits ?,competitivetitanfall,cg5f82n,1,t5_2yvm2
586277,0,t3_20tkia,I took the initiative to make a TitanFall Competitive channel.Just need some people to help with the art and media side. I stream a bit and do recordings but more content submitters would be nice. ,competitivetitanfall,cg6wwno,1,t5_2yvm2
612804,0,t1_cg9wyny,Then this should only matter for ctf because after the first maaybe  seconds hardpoint doesnt care which side you started on and people should only be able to cry wolf if they lost by at most  points. Ive never had a match that close though Im not saying it doesnt or hasnt happened.I havent played a huge amount of CTF so Im not going to pretend Im particularily educated on the subject.,competitivetitanfall,cg9xen6,1,t5_2yvm2

672323,0,t3_21rnof,This game was not ready for competitive out the box! Plus with cod regional and champs and lans etc last few weeks the major console fps has been kicking off myself I havent played any titanfall for a few days and Ive been watching mlg streams! A couple more updates getting this game up to standard wand well see more onterest in the scene,competitivetitanfall,cggoxyf,1,t5_2yvm2
766646,0,t1_cgq81d4,Exactly. Shaving time off your titan timer is the most important part of the game. Dying on objectives is actually extremely bad at the start of the game because you feed into the enemy teams titans and players just do not have any good options for dealing with titans except their own titan.,competitivetitanfall,cgrf8dc,2,t5_2yvm2
