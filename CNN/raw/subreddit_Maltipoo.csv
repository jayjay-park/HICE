8908903,0,t3_52a0jw,Ours has gone pretty well.  We have a  pound Blockhead Lab and added a toy Maltipoo for my wife  months ago.  They have become the best of friends but playtime had to be monitored early because the little dog is fragile and doesnt know it.   She was stepped on a few times but nothing injured her thankfully.  Shes a fun dog smart and hypoallergenic with no shedding but you will invest in grooming every  days or clippers to do it yourself.  Maltipoos benefit from the solid poodle lines so see the parents and some older siblings if possible to make sure you get sturdy small dogs not sickly runts.  Coco is  months now  pounds and has been a nice addition to the family.  We recommend the dog.,Maltipoo,d7ipya5,2,t5_36mis
