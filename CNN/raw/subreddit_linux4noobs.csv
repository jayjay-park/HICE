The open source video drivers for Intel NVidia and AMD are included by default on install installers autodetect and supply the right driver on all current mainstream Linux distros.You can... if you choose... install the proprietary drivers for AMD or NVidia.

172059,0,t3_1w1ydm,In the words of the greatest book jacket ever Dont panic.    No where am I claiming to be an expert I am just trying to help and telling you how I do things.  I am also not trying to talk down at any point you said you are new so I am going to over simplify things at points.  For sake of convenience I am going to paste commands in here in the following way         commandname ltargumentgt optionalargument     commandname ltdittogt style      output here  The  means as normal user or either way the  is as root.  I will also add ltcomment about commandgt after commands or output but I am not trying to be confusing with .   Lets see how much memory you have in case the error message is the actual error.       df h    You should see something like        Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use Mounted on    devsda       G  .G  G      The top row is probably the one you are concerned about and should be something like devsda.  You can also pass T home to see whats there but I think a full memory analysis is better.  If the use is close to  then there is going to be some cleaning out to do.   Next how did you change your password?  This is just me being curious.  Lets try checking on the password status and changing it with the command line.        sudo su    sudo password for ltusernamegt     This is it asking for your password.         passwd ltusernamegt status        ltusernamegt L | NP | P  ltdateoflastchangegt ltminagegt ltmaxagegt ltwarningperiodgt ltinactivityperiodgt         passwd ltusernamegt    You can then reset the password and try again.  Also did you select encrypt home folder or some such when you installed mint?  This brings in another host of issues.  Let me know where you are at after this and we can keep working on it.,linux4noobs,cey13do,2,t5_2qy7t

416787,0,t1_cfny84a,Yes. I have RAID  set up for Windows. My guess is that it is not software RAID since when I ordered the laptop three years ago I selected Hard Drive RAID and the hard drives were RAIDed out of the box I didnt have to set anything up within Windows. Regarding why I did that...when I ordered my machine I didnt really do as much research as I should have because my old machine was almost completely dead and I needed a new one. So when it came to choosing hard drives I selected the option that gave me the most space.I would like to just have Linux be the sole OS on my hard drive but since this is my first installation of Linux I need to get the hang of using it completely which shouldnt be too badIve used Linux and Unix multiple times for SSH and code development and ensure that I dont need anything that requires Windows. And although this is a much less pressing issue I would like to keep Windows around for my games. A couple friends of mine suggested that I just use Linux virtually rather than go through the hassle of partitioning drives. I know I can do that but it kind of seems like a copout to me. I want the experience of actually installing it on a machine and I dont want to basically run two OSs at the same time.,linux4noobs,cfnys5z,2,t5_2qy7t

Hell even an experienced user who is seeingtrying Arch for the first time will not be up and running in  minutes.I think you underestimate the power of familiarity. If youre used to Arch you will fly through the install.  If youve never seen Arch before... its a bit of a long haul that first time speaking as someone who has been using Linux since  but is not a regular Arch user... but has worked his way through the Arch beginners guide several times over the years.,linux4noobs,chl6due,4,t5_2qy7t

If this is the problem then nothing else will help. This is probably also the easiest thing to check.ustimulatedEmission is spot on here. If this in fact the problem then your best bet to fix it is probably going to be copying the files off the drive reformatting it as ext and then copying the files back.

1616582,0,t1_cjiqgje,For anyone who is mildly interested in this the script takes IFSdelimited words in multiple lines from the command line puts them in an array and sends them ultimately to a player. Kind of what youd expect with the addition of handling multiple lines of input. The first normal thing that comes to mind is checking for a supplied argument and if none then while read var from devstdin. Apparently however reading from stdin is undefined in POSIX something about subshells. A quick check online suggests that there may be a way to get around this by using exec but its neither easy nor pretty.So OP in general you wont be able to pipe input into just any random shell script. If the script is in fact written to accept input from stdin it may imply some hackage and may not work with every possible input. If you want to pursue this just search on bash script input from stdin and look at the first few hits to see your unhappy options. ,linux4noobs,cjixqgx,2,t5_2qy7t

2334570,0,t3_2m0mw5,The most important criteria are package management and repositories as many other people have said.  You want a reliable and intelligent package manager which recovers well from user errors. You want large repositories with a wide variety of good quality packages.  You want thirdparty packages of obscure software to play well with the vetted official packages.There are also some differences in other administration tools on about the same level as package management but honestly Im not enough of a sysadmin to care about them and I dont expect a beginner user to care either.Overall popularity and size of the distro is also important because you want a large community to provide support. This is often correlated to the size and quality of the repositories. You dont want to be one of five people to be using some special sauce experimental distro when youre just starting out no matter how much people have raved at you about how awesome it is in theory.DEs and other default options are mostly irrelevant as you have correctly concluded and it drives me crazy how much people obsess over them and conflate them with distributions. Sure its convenient to have one that you like installed by default the very first time you try Linux but once youre not an absolute beginner any more it really doesnt matter.,linux4noobs,cm09kei,0,t5_2qy7t

Linux programs will have some difficulties to run of a windows NTFS partition. So in your case I would go with a linux partition bit enough for linux and the programs a second linux partition for your home directory on which you keep you data files you only needed in linux office documents downloads... and then one windows partition big enough for windows..and a second one for shared files like music and videos Can have games on that one too but I dont see a big reason why not put them on the same partition as the windows base installDual booting has no influence on performance other that parts of the harddisk being inaccessible in windows.

When booting in recovery mode and can view the nonquiet boot messages it always freezes on some point when loading information about a NVIDIA HDMI thing Sound card that i do not use I believe Possibly loading two sound cards is my issue?I do not yet have a solution I have tried the following using a LiveCD mounting the partitions and chrooting is that a verb? lol in and preforming the following Blacklisting sndhdaintel and here and here Creating .asoundrc file to change default sound card Removing alsa and alsautils and reinstalling via aptitude Using pavucontrolI think this may fix it for me by letting me choose the right default sound card however I cannot get the pavucontrol GUI to work xserver error from a liveCD. A bit beyond my limits.I have a few things I am going to try tonight BIOS settings mainly and I will report back if I find anything that fixes this in the hopes it may help you.

When theres new version of whatever application its extremely fast in repos.gtAURThe huge community driven repository that arch has  It feels like what was promised when I switched to linux but has not been delivered in other distros. When I read about something I can find it on AUR when I see someone mention a new project theres very likely a git package on AUR of it. Its incredible and makes arch feel much more comfortable than dicking around with google and PPA on buntu distros and such.gtclean packagesI dislike modified packages that you sometime get in other distros some can be of interest like opensuse firefoxKDE has some better dialog of file choosing or somethingbtw can be find on AUR and used on arch. But generally I really like having packages to be vanilla without some modifications. You know what you are getting and wont get some surprises.gtease of customizabilityOf course you can play with any distro and switch stuff around but arch is build from the ground up and maintained in the spirit that you get to choose your combination of packages and if you want i on top of KDE with custom kernel running it is absolutely prepared to guide you and deliver that. You have this ease of switching between DEWM without leaving your distro in any way.gtthe communityWhen I was choosing distros and was hopping around my most important requirement at that time was that it has to have larger active community to have somewhere to turn for news and help and feel like project is moving and living.

Im not saying OP is stupid.  Weve all done it.

Google followed swiftly because they bought several archives Deja Vu sp and at least one other that actually held any attachments posted. Google couldnt advertise on Usenet so it wasnt in their  interest to keep it very viable the archives.Then there was googlegroups which wasnt half bad until they kept screwing with interface to make it useless.Reddit is damn close to what Usenet was sort of anonymous but refreshing in a way. But Im an old first OE then Agent  briefly and then Xnews and Pan on windows fella.

4284680,0,t3_39zxkb,The first time i installed Linux was maby  year ago. id recommand you to start with something like Xubuntu too or Antergos. I started with UbuntuGnome what I wouldnt recommand you because it needs more or less fast hardware. The biggest advantage of using Ubuntu is the Wiki which is very nice. An other advantage is the very friendly community around it. I used Linux as my main system the entire time from  year ago. From time to time I ran into a few problems but solving these problems made me lern and discover and was fun for me. I think if you want to use Linux as main system it should make you a bit fun solving problems. You will also have to read a lot of stuff.Maby  months ago I installed Windows again. But it didnt feel right and i missed a few things like the multible virtual desktops the commandline etc. an other thing was the update system of Windows which really pisses me off now. So i erased it after a few days and installed arch. Im realy happy with it but i have right now  little things which arent working like i want. But fixing these problems makes a lot of fun for me. I have a litte tip for you if you want to have the advantages from arch try Antergos. The installation is nearly the same like the one from Ubuntu you can choose between several DEs or a window manager like OpenboxOpenbox needs less hardware ressources than xfce i think can encrypt you can install a basic firewall and use the AUR. It is all pre configurated and ready to use. But you have to know that its a rolling release which can crash your system in worst case. ,linux4noobs,cs8lqkv,1,t5_2qy7t

The  in my case indicates the priority. You can set multiple MX records in your DNS and an email service will try to send the mail first to MX record  and keeps trying a higher option until it is sent or run out of MX records. So MX record  will be tried before MX record  etc.  Then the address which should just be the address of the server hosting your mail service. As you can see a domain name is also allowed so in case of an IP change you only have to change  record.    In my case I use the mail service provided by Microsoft which was free back at the time.

5553342,0,t3_3r4ogu,Oh I just thought of another one man pages.  I hate hate hate them for two reasons.  First they are usually written by programmers for other programmers and typically dont show actual usage examples including the most common usage cases in the rare case where they do they are usually way down near the bottom of the file instead of right at the top where they should be. Instead they overwhelm you with a list of options that in many cases are totally meaningless if you have never used the program before.The second reason I hate them is that when you get stuck and ask for help in a Linux forum often the resident forum expert a.k.a. resident troll will condescendingly tell you to read the man page as if its the golden ticket to solving all your problems.  When in reality it usually confuses more than it helps.At least in Windows most software authors seem to realize the need for good documentation and they also realize they cant assume ANYTHING about the prior knowledge or skill level of users.

This means your bootloader is likely kept in devsda most likely a MiB vfat partition. Assuming you havent messed with any of the data on your other partitions you should be able to just chroot in and reinstall GRUB make sure you have the boot files in place and regenerate the GRUB boot entry. fdisk isnt terribly helpful.

Although all Linux distros use Linux not all Linux distros are the same.You can build from source for a package made for Linux  if you went and got the source files from Github and manually matched all the dependencies. And everything would be pretty much equal. But the packages in the user repos are distro specific. They may be source or binaries and they have distrospecific commands and dependencies.

7449827,0,t3_4hblif,Fedora and OpenSUSE are very similar. Systemd based similar approach to package management both are upstream to enterprise level distros Red Hat and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SLES. SUSE uses Zypper for package management and Red Hat uses DNF but DNF is actually a wrapper for the Zypper libs. Fedora will always be fairly close to upstream operates on a staged release cycle. OpenSUSE has both stable staged releases and a rolling release variety.Mint on the other hand is downstream from Ubuntu . LTS doesnt use systemd Upstart uses apt. Was originally developed for Cinnamon desktop as a fork of GNOME  turned into something else. Takes longer to get security backports has had a security omnishambles recently but no companies are immune to that and they caught it pretty quickly. My preference for using Ubuntu over Mint is that Cinnamon is available on Ubuntu anyway and being upstream it gets security backports quicker.Just my opinion. Some people love Mint I dont see the point aside from Cinnamon. OpenSUSE is the less configurable of Fedora and more bloated initially but easier for new users and less to worry about. Fedora is my preference out of the three if its a choice between the three. Otherwise I like Fedora Debian Alpine. ,linux4noobs,d2ozye4,1,t5_2qy7t

7947097,0,t3_4o3m0h,So its basically the Arch LTS kernel because Antergos is Arch with an installer and uses the Arch repos. LTS means long term support. If you check kernel.org youll see there are currently a number of kernels in the wild. A few of them are labelled longterm a few stable and one called mainline depending on the development stage its also called RC or release candidate. They have different lifespans for support meaning security and bugfix backports. The mainline is the cutting edge kernel which is either very current or in testing. The stable have a shorter support lifespan you can see that here while the longterm are given longterm support.Basically mainline moves forward all the time and may contain some bugs. Mainline introduces new driver support new feature support etc. that needs to be tested. Stable has reached the point where no new drivers or features will be added but bugfixes will be released but it has a limited support lifespan. Longterm LTS in this case has an extended lifespan. You can see that in the case of the . kernel which is used on older versions of Linux still running its up to six years.However heres the rub. You dont get the kernel from kernel.org. Your distribution gets the kernel then adds some patches then releases it into their repos for you to download. And your distribution doesnt do the bugfixes pushed into kernel.org releases theyre done by the kernel team.So its up to your distribution maintainers to actually push out bugfixes to their kernels. Now with Arch they choose the latest LTS kernel from kernel.org to be their LTS version. But the priority for Arch is on the latest kernel. And even then it takes them a while to actually get the kernel out. So if a bug is found on the LTS kernel then its up to the Arch maintainers to backport it to their LTS kernel. And this can take some time. And because a minority of users use LTS you can see some indicative but not definitive statistics here that point to LTS being installed on around  of machines then backports to LTS arent priority. Even if its a serious bug it could take a while.So as someone who has a lovehate relationship with Arch I would recommend that you avoid the LTS kernel. Either use the frequently update prioritised regular kernel or if you want a stable long term kernel choose an older version with long term support from the AUR. But for your current install choose the regular kernel.,linux4noobs,d49bu0z,1,t5_2qy7t

I copied the current urls from the current page and using a macro got the following on a simple spread sheet.  i will only put  here for example I assume i need to now put these in to a script with curl. Simple text. But i have only used curl on the command line and honestly dont know what Im doing with it other than seeing what the html code is on the url. It matches what inspecting the page has using chrome or firefox so thats a good sign. Originally i did wget url P file location and it made a very nice file with all the folders and html pages for where the mp files should have been but the mp files were only  kb each which i know wasnt correct. Im sorry if this is a pain just trying to figure this all out.

But id recommed you getting a virtualmachine of centos mint the distro is not so important like that and reading the book the linux command line by William Shotts. The important part is that you not only read but also play around with the OS do some projects things like that. You can also do the codeacademy course but itll only teach you the basics.

8908163,0,t1_d7i7yvm,I guess that depends on what your internet problem is because outside of Fedora Id go for Ubuntu. I choose Ubuntu over Debian because Debian non free driver support sucks. If you have wireless and Debian isnt supporting your NIC out of the box you can use the non free Debian release which will support hardware without an open source driver like the Intel wireless chip I have in one machine. The trick is to say no when it asks you to install firmware from an external source because its already loaded... Otherwise theres Arch based distros Manjaro maybe? Or if you dont mind older software theres CentOS but that also uses Anaconda so you might have the same problem.You could also try a Slackware derivative. Salix?Problem is that theyre all based on a few different ones and the ones that arent are lacking in package support.,linux4noobs,d7imr7d,2,t5_2qy7t

8983604,0,t3_53bv0b,gtfrom what i gather the amdgpu opensource driver is already installed?It should be but Im not sure if . ships with a recent enough kernel to actually support AMDGPU. You can check this with the command lsmod | egrep amd|rad. gt amdgpuproThats the proprietary driver stack so you might have some trouble with kernel updates and such similar to using the proprietary nvidia drivers. Generally theres no need to install the proprietary cards though. gtalso what is GCN RadeonsSI LLVM. some people recommended padoka ppa for mesa. but i dont know what that ppa even does or what mesa even is GCN stands for Graphics Core Next its really just AMDs GPU architecture series.  RadeonSI is the Radeon driver meant for the Southern Islands series of GPUs they have substantially better performance than the regular Radeon drivers  but arent nearly as good as the AMDGPU drivers. LLVM stands for Low Level Virtual Machine its a compiler that many are looking at using instead of GCC. Theres tons of articles on the merits of both why people are switching and so on but the most you really need to know to get by is that its another compiler.All in all AMDs cards work flawlessly on the open source drivers so depending on the GPU you have just use the Radeon RadeonSI or AMDGPU drivers. No additional configuration or drivers are needed. ,linux4noobs,d7rowdh,2,t5_2qy7t

9084435,0,t3_54p5rz,Theres absolutely nothing unadvanced about Ubuntu. You can literally do anything with Ubuntu that you can do on any other distro. Wanna only work out of the terminal? Install Ubuntu server which ships with no desktop environment. Even if you keep your regular Ubuntu install you can go ahead and switch out the windows manager or desktop environment at will basically. Dont be fooled by Ubuntus ease of use with lack of abilities. Ubuntu is one of the most widely used professional Linux distributions in the world. You want to experiment with some more advanced things? Learn BASH or set up SSH or try hosting your own LAMP server try switching out Unity desktop environment with XFCE if you want a light weight yet powerful DE. Personally I really like Ubuntu because it just works out of the box and is still super forgiving if you mess something up. If your really dead set on switching distros you could try Debian or Elementary OS or Mint or Kali Linux these distros are all Debian based and have basically all the same exact functionality but ship with different packages.,linux4noobs,d83sul7,13,t5_2qy7t

9092655,0,t3_54r3ic,Heads up DX titles often does not work on WINE but then your box should be able to run a Gaming windows VM with PCI passthrough when they dont. For stuff that actually runs well on WINE with the Integrated GPU it is recommended that you play it with WINE I often find it works better Whichever distro you pick it helps A LOT if you have a second system not sure whether cellphonestablets has that handy to go on IRC with.  Most major distros has an IRC channel in Freenode that might be able to help you in quasirealtime.As for each of your questionsgt Firstly would a migration like this be worth it? I have very limited experience with linux I sideloaded Ubuntu a few years back and toyed with it a bit though I find the interface and feel of it to be more appealing if that makes sense.Well I cant tell you how well dualbooting works because I hate doing that Thats minutes of your life you sit in front of your screen not doing anything productiveinteresting every time you reboot.  I specifically bought parts that lets me setup a Windows VM just to play games.  The migration part is totally worth it unless your stuff cant do passthrough Back when my first gen i got bricked none of my machines can do passthrough and they all ran LinuxFreeBSD.  I ended up not playing Guild Wars  anymore because the Wine setup isnt working as good as I would like to begt Can anyone give feedback  advice for gaming on linux? Can modern titles DOOM and Just Cause  being some of the most recent titles I regularly play be played whether by direct linux support or using Wine or similar tools without suffering any or minimal performance loss?Probably not Doom  unless you are venturing into illegit versions.  And nobody tried Just Cause  and live to tell the tale apparently.  But yes there is such a list you can see if you can find your games in.  And if your games are from steam chances are some of them has linux port and the linux port may have Steam play.  Steam play for a particular game means that particular game client can play with same game clients on different platformgtMy PC has an SSD boot drive and three storage drives. Will jumping to linux on the SSD still leave the rest of the drives accessible they contain media movies games duh and some Windows applications to linux? I remember when I sideloaded Ubuntu I couldnt access files stored in the Windows partition though this was all on one drive. Would additional drives suffer the same fate?ntfsg is your friend hopefully you arent using FAT for your drives.  If you do look up dosfstools.  Have some expectations of rough edges if you mount it readwrite in linux and mount the drive in windows later mostly permission issuesgt Would you still be able to play LAN games with Windows PCs? My boyfriend and I are both gamers and we regularly play with  against each other. Is it possible to play through a LAN crossplatform? The games we play are typically things like Starbound Modern Warfare Minecraft here and there... Nothing huge.Minecraft can play cross platform IIRC.  I dont know the efficacy of WINE games over the network I play single player games mostly however.gt Which distro would be best for my needs? They are for the most part the following Gaming support great ricing capabilities general easeofuse I consider myself to be pretty techsavvy though Im by no means an expert and great media support I use Kodi to convert my rig into a HTPC of sorts so being able to do this would be great.I recommend Debian testingor SteamOS.  If you are bold go openSUSE tumbleweed or Arch Steam is integrated with SteamOS Id be really surprised if steam doesnt work in SteamOS.  Includes proprietary drivers too.  Drawback is that you might have less success in customizing the interface. Debian testing stablejessie may suffer from packages being outdated because those are more stabilityfocused releases  works well allrounded  VM setup WINEPlayOnLinux proprietary drivers etc. .  Drawback is testing whether hardware is compatible is less straight forward than the other distros I suggested. Become an expert through learning with Arch the drawback is that it has a steeper learning curve than the other two distros I suggested. OpenSUSE tumbleweed is one of the most bleeding edge distros you can get rolling release really easy to set up VMs.  Drawback is that proprietary formats requires rd party repository and bleeding edge kind of means occasional rough edges that you have to take headon.gt EDIT How is the driver support? A quick readingup shows that Nvidia seems to be great with Linux drivers though what about other things like my WiFi network card DLink DWA N or something like that my Razer products Blackwidow Chroma keyboard Deathadder mouse Synapse is necessary for configuring the RGB lighting of my keyboard and so on? Can these things also be run through something like Wine?In terms of drivers if installer USBCDDVD has a live environment open a terminal and run lspci to see whether the PCIe device is being seen properly.  lsusb would do the same for USB devices. In terms of LED colouring Razer has a kit I havent try it so YMMV to do it.  If you are playing games in a Windows VM you can redirect the USB device and you can set the functionalities like colouring and custom keys inside the VM.,linux4noobs,d84shg9,1,t5_2qy7t

10259408,0,t3_5mrxnk,Using a separate system only for online banking is maybe not necessary but definitely will enhance security. However using a live USB is probably a bad idea for online banking as you dont have the latest patches installed.    You could always update before opening the browser but this would be quite tedious as updates would be lost after shutting it down. Burning a new ISO to the USB or CD is also not an option because releases are infrequent and also dont contain the latest security patches and updates. Thats why you have to aptget update ampamp aptget upgrade after installing a new buntuA better idea is to just install Ubuntu or really any distro of your choice well except Kali and other specialised distros onto an USB stick and then use that system only for banking.

10733737,0,t3_5tjn7b,What Id do.Remove sda and sda.Create a new ext partition in the place. There is no point moving sda     and . And it is too risky..From the new partitions properties copy its UUID to a text file..Create a new mount point for the partition          sudo mkdir mediabackupsIt is very wise to have backups .Add a new line to etcfstab. Open it          gksudo gedit etcfstabAnd add something like this     added new partition for backups     UUIDcecbcaccccb  mediabackups     ext  defaults      .Mount the new partition          sudo mount t ext devsda mediabackups.Reinstall GRUB just in case          sudo grubinstall devsdaNow why I think it is a good solution. You have a spare partition. In case you wanted to try a new distro you can use it. No need for separate home really. Or instead of upgrading your current version to a new one which is always risky you install the new version alongside it. I have similar setup Distro currently my working one on partition  and distro on partition  a newer one but I like the older. Eventually Ill move to distro becoming the working one leaving the first one just in case and eventually replacing it with a new one in the future. ,linux4noobs,ddn3rwy,2,t5_2qy7t

Good news literally any distro will cover these criteria gt I plan to run this in a virtual machineMore good news trying out a new distro will just be a matter of downloading an iso and spending  minutes to create a new VM.gt so I rather this be as barebones as possible to keep it from taking up too many resources.If you want to keep down the RAM usage the most important thing will be the choice of Desktop environment. My recommendations for lightweight DE are XFCE or MATE. These are very easy to use and are well supported by most Linux distros. All the major linux distros ship versions of their installation ISOs that comes with one of these DEs preinstalled.But I suspect that even the larger DEs might run just fine if you try them out. The difference from the most lightweight DE to the most heavyweight one is just a couple hundred MB...gt  Ive also heard of bash for windows but im not comfortable enough with only that hence the GUI. Yeah why bother with that when you can use a real OS instead? gt As an aside I found a distro which I thought looked interesting called crunchbang but it appears to not have been undated in whileNowadays Crunchbang is kinda dead but there is a spiritual successor called Bunsenlabs. I would advise against using a distro that isnt being updated anymore since things might now work well bugs and security updates will be unfixed documentation will be outdated and so on. gt but I got a lot of out of date articles and none of them seemed to be what I was looking for anyways. If you ask me the best thing to do if you never used Linux before is to pick one of the major distros and use one of the major desktop environments. This way it is super easy to google for help which is not always the case for smaller distros like CrunchbangBunsenlabs and less popular DEs CrunchbangBunsenlabs have a custom openboxbased desktop.Do you know what distro your professor is going to be using? My recommendation would be to try to use the same distro that they will be using but with XFCEMATE instead of whatever DE that they use. If you dont know what distro they will be using then I think Debian or Ubuntu would be a safe bet.,linux4noobs,declwmp,3,t5_2qy7t

11006637,0,t1_deffxv9,I just installed Solus as my backup OS. I also have budgie installed as an alternate desktop on my Arch install but I use Gnome primarily there.I like Solus. Its been a smooth experience so far. I doubt that theres much if any difference between the budgie desktop experience so its more of a question of rolling release vs. Ubuntu. The major drawback to Solus at this point is package availability. That being said their collection is well curated and so Ive gotten  of what I normally would want or need when I have the almost unlimited package availability of Arch. You could check their repos for certain packages you need and see their wait list for packages they are adding to their repos.So I would say if package availability of some very fringe stuff you use is a big concern then Ubuntu might be the way to go. Otherwise given my experience so far has been very good and I have a strong preference for the long term stability of RR distros I personally would take Solus over Ubuntu. But your preferences may differ. Really I would still take Arch by a long way over either but thats another matter.,linux4noobs,defkkyj,1,t5_2qy7t

11146323,0,t1_dev7zhq,I dont know man PATH works fine for me. gtAnything involving the terminal is just almost inherently easier on Linux.I really think that depends. Of course if youre new to linux and only know commands like cd and ls  its going to be a little harder for you to work your way around the terminal then someone whos been using Windows command line for years.It really comes down to personal preference.I believe. Yeah of course there might be some things that you can only get on Linux. For example a few months ago I was working on a Python project in Windows and I needed to get OpenAIs Gym and Universe packages. I went and pip install gymd and to my surprise it turns out Gym is not available on Windows. Of course between Windows and Linux there will always be certain things for one platform but not the other but I feel that regarding which one is better depends on a case by case and person by person basis. Even though Linux is a better environment for me I cant say that it will be for the next guy.,linux4noobs,devf9q0,1,t5_2qy7t

11435667,0,t1_dfs5wiz,It would be better to start thinking these less as commands and more like tools. grep is a filtering tool. It filters things. ls is a listing tool it lists all files that are in a specific directory cat is a concatenate tool which displays one or more text files together. Like regular tools hammer saw screwdriver you can use Linux tools together to get the results your looking for. This is why I recommended that you start with the first command     cat AssignmentscommandsAsstprojectfilename.txtthen when your ready pipe it out with a grep like this    cat AssignmentscommandsAsstprojectfilename.txt | grep i sequentialInsertOf course let me know if you need some more understanding to make sense of what I am asking you to do...As well if you looking for files or folders with the name sequentialInsert you could also use the find or locate tool.

In terms of your own machine being infected the use of an adblockeruse ublock origin and a nonroot desktop session should shield you from malicious programs just fine. If you still want an antivirus then try ClamAV. gtBut what did you do to get familiar with Linux? How did you learn terminal. And are there any good beginner guides on how to get used to Linux?Best thing I can suggestThe book is free under CCA.I personally jumped right into the mess without knowing much and figured things out using help from redditgoogleaskubuntu. The site I recommended also helped. And Mate is kind of straightforward and works out of the box so its not a big deal. And Im far from being perfect with all this yet but Ill get there eventually. Its only been a month having switched to linux afterall.. Also Ill be installing Arch as my rd OS soon I currently have it in a vm so that I get familiar to iwmmemorising all shortcuts and ricing. Installing arch is quite a task too as there is no gui installer you have to install from the terminal directly but the archwiki is awesome and it helped.
