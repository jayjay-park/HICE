3092796,0,t1_coidsdk,It seems to be a mixture between reductio ad absurdum and an appeal to ignorance conjured to shift the burden of proof to you if that makes sense.

This is about theory not practice so as the sidebar says under Basic Rules we avoid actually arguing against OP.Are you interested in discussing how those points should be countered to help OP argue in favor of BLM or are you just sharing your position?,WinMyArgument,da0eznw,1,t5_2zriy
9874316,0,t1_daslnbg,gt You should like it as there is no practical downside.gt People will abuse it but they are in the minority. Unfortunately that minority ruins it for the rest because the policy makers are too scared to take that risk in most places.,WinMyArgument,daunala,1,t5_2zriy
