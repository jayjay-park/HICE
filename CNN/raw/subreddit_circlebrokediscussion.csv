801597,0,t1_cgve05x,Nope. He never broke our rules or said anything shady. He actually made quality posts. But he was consistently downvoted and witch hunted whenever he posted. The mods discussed it and decided we werent gonna punish him based on his personal beliefs which he expressed on other subreddits. It was funny because he made good content and followed the rules while these crusaders broke our rules and shitted up the community.,circlebrokediscussion,cgve85z,1,t5_2uqyi
1141474,0,t3_26z4nf,I find low effort posts are basically just super downvotes someone got so annoyed by a post they decide to post it for others to mock. At least with the full text posts is actually looking at all of the different opinions presented.,circlebrokediscussion,chy0z41,4,t5_2uqyi

1884239,0,t3_2g5v8v,I hate to sound cynical but the defaults have always sucked. Rage comics were never funny image macros were never funny and racismsexism has always been a pervasive problem in juvenile internet fora. Furthermore every single subreddit is essentially a circlejerk. The focus on one topic to the exclusion of others means that after a month of subbing to literally any sub youve seen all the opinions and situations that the sub caters to.So with that here are my thoughts for youIf you want a safer space to find funny material try going to imgur or gag. If you want helpful intelligent content unsubscribe from defaults and try subs like rdepthhub rfoodforthought rtheoryofreddit that try to bring new higheffort content in. But also make sure to unsubscribe from rcirclebroke rsubredditdrama and anything SRSrelated because the circlejerk on those subreddits is to shove the nasty side of the juvenile subs in your face.,circlebrokediscussion,ckg8rea,2,t5_2uqyi
2983289,0,t1_co77gyx,Yup the Amerikkka jerk is something that is worth looking at on Circlebroke due to the fact it coexists with proamerica jerks and due to the fact it somewhat contradicts the sites userbase but analyzing it from SAS and doing it so poorly really is stupid. Especially since the SAS rebuttal was so... easy compared to the CB post and easily came across as the correct one. Analysing a subreddit that is openly circlejerky is also a waste of time anyway.gtI really find nationalism fascinating and Id love to chew over the weird things that it does to peoples minds but these threads arent really the place for it. I wouldnt go so far as to take them down but I agree with you that its more petty popcorn entertainment than anything of real substance or insight.While CB may not be the best place to properly analyse stuff its more entertaining when its done well or about a more conflicting jerk. At the moment CB only upvotes posts with views it agrees with and seems to have forgotten the whole not all jerks are bad thing and more emotive DAE LE RODDIT IS EVIL get right to the top. Im just sick of seeing the exact same jerks circlejerks to death on CB just so we can feel smug and get petty entertainment.,circlebrokediscussion,co77rbk,3,t5_2uqyi
5991453,0,t3_3xhhpl,The Libertarian thing kind of got shoehorned in with the typical fedorad neckbeard.  Now most of Reddit is liberal including Circlebroke but being that they dont want to insult their own ideology they attatched the AnarcoCapitalist stigma to the preexisting neckbeard.  It fits because Libertarianism is a pretty edgy survivalofthefittest concept that most would actually probably disagree with.  Much like with the deluded Christians who the atheist has surpassed by denouncing religion the Libertarian would disregard the oppressive and limiting established government.  Im not saying its completely accurate its just the train of thought that married the two concepts into a strawman chimera.,circlebrokediscussion,cy50dxo,1,t5_2uqyi
6380095,0,t3_42zjtn,gtWhy not just force people to tag their posts have automoderator remove anything that isnt tagged and combine cb prime cb and openbroke?We tried a tagging system before we made openbroke. It didnt work well.gtIts getting to be a little annoying that any post about social justice is removedIts getting to be a little annoying that they expect me to post social justice content in the social justice sub.gtI just think it would be nice to have some categorization.You mean like... multiple subreddits?,circlebrokediscussion,czeuk23,3,t5_2uqyi
6803975,0,t1_d0n4qgm,Holy shit.  I was wondering why there were actual comments at the top instead of the typical mad rush to reduce every situation to the racegender element.,circlebrokediscussion,d0niw75,8,t5_2uqyi
10422909,0,t1_dcpfs54,Ive read this a few times and I feel compelled to give you some advice word quantity does not make ones rebuttal stronger or in your case more coherent.  Like seriously the paragraphs you type after my quotations are either pedantic or only tangentially related and dont even seem to address the claims being made.  Most of the time its just you ignoring whatever I typed and going off on your own separate rant.gtYou want heady intellectual conversations about real life issues? Well toughen up buttercup because you first need to do all the emtional labor to get to the point where you can HAVE that conversation with people like me.Ive had conversations with you before several in fact.  But Im not sure any amount of emotional labor would make me as good at typing hundreds of words of dodging the point as you are.Also gtRight off the bat you are creating a paradigmHuh?Hm...EDIT Jesus these ignorant voters.  Look guys quantity doesnt mean substance.  Read the entire thing theres like two sentences worth of relevant content you can parse from this.  The rest is this ironic brand of hypocrisy and real worldisms,circlebrokediscussion,dcpi81m,-4,t5_2uqyi
