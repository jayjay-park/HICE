Ana mustve seen her quite a few times but Tracer probably not so much which is why she didnt recognize her on that rooftop or maybe she did?. I just hope they wont hurt Widow Ive grown somewhat attached to her haha. ,Widowtracer,d5dnqnp,1,t5_3f4sg

In fact I think Pharmercy came out worse in that Reflections comic since it shows Pharrah having candlelight dinner with what appears to be his significant other and Mercy and Genji apparently being shipped together.,Widowtracer,dbsctni,5,t5_3f4sg
