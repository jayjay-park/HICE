2362866,0,t1_cm3r20v,Fellow Stormrage player here. Started the queue around  today. Had lunch went to work for  hours had dinner and now about  in line. The salt is real.,realWoW,cm3rdzv,1,t5_34kxw
2363257,0,t3_2mfioz,I dont play WoW but Im intrigued by this issue. I imagine that gamers of all kinds would like to discuss the hot topics related to their game of choice when theyre unable to actually play their game. Although now the mods are booting you guys from one of the most popular places to discuss the game. Its completely ridiculous. I hope this subreddit takes off as a result.,realWoW,cm3t4cj,5,t5_34kxw

2369722,0,t1_cm4jrdg,And thats exactly part of whats wrong with reddit.  Large subreddits should be more than just their founders playthings.  rwow should really belong to the other moderators and the thousands of people who subscribed to it every bit as much as some guy who just happened to squat on a good name.,realWoW,cm4ltsi,9,t5_34kxw
3110134,0,t1_cok3hxw,gt Cant be both.Cant be both what?gt much moral superiority very high horse.dogeme but calling you fucking stupid isnt morality just objectivity.So you were awkwardly alarmed that I found this week after it happened I dont live on reddit you know just certain times.Have fun,realWoW,cokd41t,-1,t5_34kxw
