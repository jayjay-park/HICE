6615709,0,t3_454fob,I happened to like SO more than SO in fact I never finished  anyway. Once theres the big reveal toward the end of the game I kinda shook my head and said WTF? Personally I refuse to consider that reveal from  part of cannon though the rest of the story was all right. Some of the puzzles were annoying as hell though like riding that turtle through the mines  I remember that giving me a headache and I think I had to go through there more than once too. The VA doesnt bother me all that much in SO. I know Lymle is creepy and annoying with the kay but I honestly mostly ignore her. I like the rest of the cast though a good mix of personalities. Overall it might be my favorite SO or a close tie with SO which I plan to replay soon. EDIT One thing I do hate about SO though is having to constantly switch disks  and  and lack of some sort of portable crafting system. ,starocean,d03mcun,1,t5_2tfub
7101923,0,t1_d1lb8ht,Im going to buy it without considering reviews probably but I do hope it can rebecome the greatness it was. If it fails then I suppose Ill just consider SO to be a one shot wonder.,starocean,d1ldiui,1,t5_2tfub
7206059,0,t3_4e4rp8,Did it feel complete? I guess thats my biggest worry. For a JRPG to be so short on a first playthrough is a bit strange. Not saying that length  quality but I just want to know why its so much shorter than most would have thought. Maybe it was a budget issue or something. Also I hear the post game content is pretty lacking especially for a Star Ocean game what do you think about that? EDIT Actually I have some more. So you said the story was pretty much whatever not too interesting right? Can you expand upon that without any spoilers? Was it really tropey and generic? I know SO games tend not to have the best stories and though some may not agree I think SO has a great storyline. Considering that SO seems to take after SO I would have figured that the story would have been pretty good.  From what I understand all bosses have constant super armor which I think is a terrible battle design especially for an ARPG. That aside what did you think about the boss battles? I know you played Emmerson and his long range style is best suited for that type of situation but what did you think overall?  How are the dungeons? Imo Star Ocean has some of the best dungeon designs among JRPGs  and  being the best out of the series.  wasnt so good in that regard considering there tends to be a trend among current JRPGs where its pretty much point A to point B and pick a path maybe youll find some treasure Im looking at you Tales of GracesXilliaZestiria. Were there any interesting puzzles or something for you to think about while running through the dungeons? I actually have a lot more questions but Im already late for work. Excuse any typos as I dont have time to proofread.  ,starocean,d1x9s7y,3,t5_2tfub
7299864,0,t3_4dl0fk,Yes it does and by a lot. Star Ocean games have always been about insane replay value even if not too long playtime on a single go SO for example. SO raised that bar higher giving both strong replay value and very good playthrough duration. Now SO is rumored to lack in both aspects. A huge turn off for me.,starocean,d27y0zl,1,t5_2tfub
7538128,0,t3_4igzhe,I think all Ps games are REQUIRED to have a digital release physical release is the optional one now.,starocean,d2z1r7a,1,t5_2tfub
8092690,0,t3_4q2nkn,I think they usually is a new game plus. Im still kicking myself for not getting collectors. Stab the sword of justices remix is excellent. I would replay the shit outta the game to hear it lol,starocean,d4powh4,2,t5_2tfub
8097525,0,t3_4plqil,I hope there are some puzzles i know they can be really annoying at times but I kinda like them in the end.,starocean,d4q8gjs,1,t5_2tfub
8131523,0,t1_d4twog2,Or get Minstrel and Altruist and get SP instead which is  more useful than fol xD ,starocean,d4u21fx,1,t5_2tfub

8858918,0,t3_51l08g,There is very little grinding but there are a few difficulty spikes when it comes to a boss or two. However if you encounter said difficulties without spoiling anything I will just say there is plenty of advice out there.,starocean,d7cpt9f,2,t5_2tfub
9171226,0,t1_d8ehlpi,not all of em worth it considering lack of value of items trophies  percentage complition list etcIm usally along for the spectacle and the Stories,starocean,d8eirms,1,t5_2tfub
10277520,0,t3_5ldjex,I never pay attention to the reviews for this series. Those of us that are fans of the series know what we are getting into haha.  Im a few hours into SO myself and I am enjoying it thoroughly seems pretty much exactly what I expected it to be.,starocean,dc90gtg,1,t5_2tfub
