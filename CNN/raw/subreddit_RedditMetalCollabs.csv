8375626,0,t1_d5ohiyd,Sounds like a plan! I expect to have the bass part recorded by tomorrow evening. Gotta get it under my fingers completely first. Its always different with a click! Keeps you really honest. Thats the best we can do though. Im probably going to do three or four takes and then stitch together the best bits of all four. Thats generally what I do for studio recordings since I know Im gonna miss an upstroke somewhere. Playing in person is good for doing take recordings since everybody can just reflect off of one another but we dont have that luxury.Ive got a whole bunch of riffs shelved. Ill get a sampler recorded and Ill send em your way. ,RedditMetalCollabs,d5oi4ec,1,t5_3fjjs
