8327849,0,t3_4tmji2,First and foremost if the club you try to take lessons with body shames you.. find a new club. there is no size requirements or ideal body shape. Girls tend to be smaller in single cause shorterlower center of gravity. Im  lbs. Im not your typical small male figure skater. I mostly do dance but its still thrilling to do a single jump! Never once have I ever had any negativity thrown at me. ,FigureSkating,d5ijbaf,7,t5_2rld6

Falling while moving that fast would hurt pretty bad. And your technique would be off as well. A welltaught spin looks much better than a self taught one,FigureSkating,dbyk3eh,3,t5_2rld6
10210269,0,t3_5m6pxq,Pilates is good. Its mainly focused on your core but has exercises that work a lot of other parts of your body too. Its low impact exercise so its not going to make you loose tons to weight but it is good for toning and strengthening and some flexibility. Jumping rope is also good and easy to do and will help with endurance. ,FigureSkating,dc1e3dy,5,t5_2rld6
10597551,0,t1_dd8y984,Ahhh I feel like Ive phrased my question really badly gtltI can try giving an example if itll help.Really basic example Ive finished skating Ive wiped down my blades and put soakers on them.When I get home I take the soakers off and let them air out.At what point do I put hard guards on them?Is there a set amount of time I need to wait before putting them in hard guards? Hopefully this kinda makes more sense.Thanks for being so patient with me ,FigureSkating,dd920u8,1,t5_2rld6
10714416,0,t3_5sv29o,gracie is a great technical skater but i feel like shes become more and more stiff over the last few years partially as a function of anxiety. I hope she can get over that with these coaches! I dont particularly love her skating but its always sad to see a very strong skater not perform to their full potential. ,FigureSkating,ddl41r3,3,t5_2rld6
