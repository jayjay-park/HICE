4690826,0,t1_ctlt3jc,Thanks! Yes Im definitely familiar with the meme but it originated from message boards like chan where its easy to fake your gender and possible to post tits. Ive never been asked for tits on tf nor do people seem to think Im a guy pretending to be a girl. I have however had many people think Im a squeaker!ampnbspSo I guess my question is why has this mentality extended to video games where girls are generally heard but not seen?,teamfortresstwoX,ctltkj9,1,t5_2uja2
