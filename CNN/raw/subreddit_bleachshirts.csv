1027972,0,t3_257x9e,Hello comrade!  I have bleached a few tie dye shirts and I thought I would share my experiences with you.  The edges came out watery and not sharp.  Keep that in mind when you decide on a design.  The shirts I was working with were dyed by hand.  I dont know if you would get the same watery results if you were to use a factory made shirt.  So I would recommend keeping the design simple.  It actually worked out well for me because the design I was making was a water theme water tribe symbol from Avatar  the Last Airbender on navyturquoise.Also on another set of shirts I found it difficult to bleach the colors completely and ended up spraying too much bleachwater and it ate a hole in the shirt.  So it wont bleach like a regular shirt either.  Just dont over do the bleaching.Whatever design you decide on good luck!  Tiedye and bleaching has the potential to be super rad!,bleachshirts,chl4x13,1,t5_2sq68

3069092,0,t1_cog0sno,No it was a huge pain in the ass and I think I just need to do two different sprays in the future.What I did was to cut out the white parts.  Then I cut out the parts that were supposed to be mid tone  but I left very tiny ppieces still attached to keep them in place when I Ironed on the stencil.  After spraying a few times I would then peel them midtone areas off and keep spraying.The problem with this technique is that bleach can easily seep down through the tiny cuts as seen in this picture.I think in the future Im either going to avoid multitoned projects or do it in two distinct spraying sessions with two stencils.  Doing it all at once is a lot of work and doesnt always come out how I like  ,bleachshirts,cog3w7z,3,t5_2sq68

What I do is take an image and then trace out the shape I want in a layer over that image.
