3584146,0,t3_31bpzi,UPDATE I was asked by one of the mods of this Reddit to hold the cup exclusive here. That makes perfect sense to me as well. Since this reddit is all about FIFA on PS.I deleted the other threads which only had a reply why Scotland was included in a BeNeLux cup I explained that here thoughOn my own website. Two people signed up. I reffererd them to here. I assume theyll sign up. I asked them to sign up here and confirm their teams. Fortunally they are not taken yet. So not problem there.,FIFAonPS4,cq0tkko,1,t5_34932
