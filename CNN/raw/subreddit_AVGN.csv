2022133,0,t1_ckwfhj1,Not sure how old you are but...Before youtube videos on the internet were not really a thing.  That is to say nothing like reviews were a thing.  Quality content was not really a thing.There were videos but they were on sites like ebaums world.  Im pretty sure I got most of my videos at lan parties trading them.  The majority of them were flash animations or Hey watch this guy fall on his head crap.Things like afro ninja GVC Man Stabs himself with Katana Sword and The End of the World is what I remember seeing a lot of.  That and YTMND.com crap.Youtube came around in  and the majority of content were vlogs and they were all mostly pretty terrible.  Not so much in what the people were talking about but more so in quality.  rolls around and lonelygirl becomes decently popular and holy shit.  Youtube becomes the PERFECT medium for independent content. Note  Im not actually positive it was lonelygirl that really started the whole indie content with time and effort behind it on youtube thing.  I think her show did really kick start it thoughThe Angry Nintendo Nerd episodes start getting uploaded to youtube at or around this time.Reviews existed but the AVGN was something special at the time.  When he got his theme song it was such an amazing throw back to the shows I grew up watching.  The guy was making quality content comedy and it was nothing but bitching about video games that were terrible when my generation was growing up.  I remember when he first started uploading on a regular basis and here I was tuning in to watch his episodes monthly like a TV show or something but it wasnt on TV.  It was on the internet.  The world changed.James Rolfe most defiantly defined the video game review show gag.  Hell he invented it.I bet if you asked any of these guys what their influence was or one of them was to do the videos they do they will most definetly credit James Rolfe in some shape or formNormal BootsRetrowaretvNostalgia Critic Note  Seriously this guy is where he is today using James Rolfes AVGN character for cross oversScrewAttack Note They are where they are today because of the AVGNRedlettermediaThis idiotand a number of other youtubers or content creators from other sites and video host providers.You are kidding yourself if you honestly believe that James Rolfe did not have an effect on video content on the web.  I guess its different when you live through it instead of coming around to it at a much younger age.  Though thats just me making an assumption.  I honestly have no idea how old you are etc. To address a few of your other pointsgtDoes James truly believe he is a celebrity? does he really think he is his worshiped like his character in his horrible shitty movie?gtlol...i guess anyone on YouTube is celebrity then. Oh i forgot he goes to comic book conventions.Go to a convention that he attends and ask him.  Im sure he would answer it.  Though your condescending tone here really comes across silly.  What have you done with your life?  Are you mad that you do not get panels at conventions? As for gtanyone on youtube is a celebrity it doesnt work like that.  The AVGN is  years old this year and people still know what the character is.  Celebery or not thats some damn fine and respectable entrepreneurship.  The guy doesnt snap his fingers and he has a video uploaded to youtube or have a movie instantly created.  In closing I think James Rolfe has a cult following.  He is a celebrity to those who really like his work.  At the same time its the least important thing about the guy.  He likes to make videos.  He makes a living doing it and he is making a living still because he has fans and people who just like to watch them.Who cares?,AVGN,ckwv3mp,2,t5_2rgts

2988099,0,t3_2qt32k,I just couldnt get through it. After seeing what Ashens had done with a micro budget and tight screen with his Gamechild video I guess my expected standard was too high. People have excused the video based on the budget but for me what let it down was the script acting and editing. About the only thing that really impressed me was the soundtrack. The practical effects I can forgive as I know what they were atempting. The cast was terrible the jokes poor and James Rolfe has only really shown the limit of his acting and filming making abilities. AVGN just doesnt work the way James wants to. Still he got to live out his dream on his fans money so fair play for that. ,AVGN,co7pp5l,3,t5_2rgts
