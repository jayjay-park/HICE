When no one comes back to it it sure would give Jay enough credibility in court if HE happened to know where the car was... Wouldnt it.... Humm.... Cuz like previous posters have said its a serious sticking point for guilters. I can only imagine they knew it would be in court too. They had no case they NEEDED something corroborating Jay.

I fully accept that the cops are capable of almost anything but from their perspective going for a conviction on a completely fabricated story would be risky. The get hassled for low clearance rates but they also get hassled for wasting resources on cases that dont result in conviction.Thats not to say folks still investigating shouldnt be open to scenarios in which Jay has zero involvement.

6498674,0,t3_44lxqs,Listening right now. My make takeaway so far is Everything in Jays testimony says this is NOT premeditateda Who would premeditate a murder on a day when he left his buddy the car AND the phone? b Who would premeditate a murder when he didnt even have a shovel and have to ask Jay to find some? c If you assume that AS wanted Jay to be a false witness which shows premeditation why drag Jay along drive all over town looking for a spot? d What did Jay do except witness the whole thing? Why would AS involve him AT ALL if its premeditated?

6562434,0,t3_45i7mf,Some people are jumping to the conclusion that Nisha is on that list of Flohrs notes as a potential alibi witness. What?!? If we take some time to actually read the list theres NOTHING there to indicate she is an alibi for anything. Youd think hed put something more there if he was instructed to check her out for alibi. Its plainly a list of things to discuss with a newly incarcerated client. Either the cops told Adnan that the girl in Silver Springs was going to confirm he and Jay were together right after hed murdered Hae and Adnan told them that could be Nisha or Flohr had asked about the midafternoon call to the Silver Springs phone number on the day of the murder and Adnan said that it was Nishas number.What about Thirus claim that Adnan did not yet know Jay had turned on him? Wheres Jays name next to Nishas? Wheres Asias name if Adnans plotted to coerce her into providing a false library alibi?

As I understand it BriAnne was at the hospital that night how was it that she found out that Isaac was in an accident something worth questioning even if it does seem far fetched. Additionally Benson suggesting that he thought it was a argument between a couple is such a weird assumption road rage maybe.

8570574,0,t1_d62ujey,This article is where the Rome News Tribune initially reports about it. Unfortunately there is no mention of what he was driving. The police didnt arrest him until four days after this incident and he seemed to have been following a girl. Edit In addition to this I found a very long history of arrests related to drugs and a particularly interesting one where he was again arrested in  for meth and possession of a firearm.

8650678,0,t1_d6mxit1,My understanding is that the police believe it was a mm but could not tell what caliber of bullet was found in Isaacs head.I disagree about a fixed position. It would be incredibly difficult if not impossible for a fixed shooter to hit a shot in the right side of Isaacs head while he is traveling  mph. The shot from a car matching his speed would be easier. A military sniper might be able to pull that off but I seriously doubt a hunter could.The height difference is the biggest factor to me. I envision a passenger sitting on the passenger door and firing over the roof into Isaacs passenger window. However that would have been noticed by other drivers even at a distance. I cannot see the driver of a Honda being able to make that shot from behind or beside the truck. Its possible but highly unlikely.,theundisclosedpodcast,d6my4pb,1,t5_37thy

9059571,0,t1_d7dzd3v,And not trying to reach Hae is not necessarily as suspect as it seems.Its been implied he wasnt as into Hae as she was into him.  Perhaps all previous contact was initiated by Hae.  Consider perhaps all calls he made to Hae were at her request either by pager verbally or by phone.  Perhaps he just wasnt in the habit of seeking her out if she didnt first suggest he do so.Its not out of the realm of possibility for a just not that into you boyfriend to not seek out contact with a girl he was seeing. Especially if he was seeing other girls.And so if the girl in question is missing and cant ask him to call her then he just doesnt.Kind of a dick move maybe but doesnt necessarily make him a murderer.Just a thought.

Its scary if they are really being used in this way.GBI is another thing entirely. State agencies are probably involved like this often because they fall under the same legal structure.

10228416,0,t3_5mbk69,Interesting episode but I think its barking up the wrong tree. Our criminal justice system is caught in a vicious cycle that goes something like thisWrongful convictions gt stricter rules of evidence gt real criminals use those rules to go free gt police and prosecutors break the rules gt wrongful convictions gt stricter rules of evidence etc. etc. etc.The way to fix this is not to toughen the rules of evidence. Its to have actual consequences for police and prosecutors who cheat and get caught even if it happens years after the fact.Its a tricky issue we dont want to punish prosecutors for mistakes misjudgments or even isolated instances of cheating. But in a case like this where there is a sustained pattern of cheating punishment for police and prosecutors should be on the table.That and only that can break the cycle.,theundisclosedpodcast,dc3g5bk,5,t5_37thy
