6228428,0,t1_cyx4omz,You ARE the only person you can help whether you agree with it or not. Just because you disagree does not make it any less true. Denial solves nothing. It just feeds your ego. You have your own problems. Think of it like sitting on the floor and laying bricks around yourself until you are trapped inside. You will call for help. But nobody can help you because they are on the same boat. They too are trapped inside their tomb of bricks. Broken people cannot fix broken people. If they try they will just end up making it worse. If you attain to your false center and the person trying to help you attains to their false center you just end up with two parasites eating attention from each other and feeding each others egos. That does not help. The only person who can help YOU is YOU. And the first step is realizing that.If a broken person And  a whole person . That is not helpful because both people are still nothing. . That is not helpful because the broken person is still nothing. . That is helpful but it is a bit of a paradox because a whole person does not need that kind of help. They already helped themselves. But you have two whole people.  I know you mean well and WANT to help people. But if you are in the same boat as the person you are trying to help it just makes things worse. It is like having a depressed therapist telling you how to cure your depression. They have no authority to tell you anything because they have not even helped themselves.If you are a broken person and you go around trying to help people you are just feeding your own ego because it feels good to help people. It feels so good especially when you are dead inside it is just the thing to fill that void. I am so helpful. I have helped so many people. I am the best helper in the world. Nobody is a better helper than me. And if nobody is a better helper than you who is going to help you? Because clearly you cannot help yourself. Only a whole person can help somebody because they can see through themselves AND you. Try your best to understand it. Try your best to accept it as a truth and not so much as an opinion that you disagree with just because you cannot see beyond yourself. ,HungryLights,cyxls83,3,t5_38jq3
