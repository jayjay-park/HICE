The beach was miserable except driving on it in NC which was fun... Asheville was nice but the roads south into the mtns were closed due to snow still. We drove back up the blue ridge parkway and spent a few nights in VA and MD with friends but no warmth was found. Just a heads up. ,vermont,cg9j01d,2,t5_2qqdd

1099902,0,t3_26oz5q,There was a huge flap about this in Brattleboro several years ago that ended with a local ordinance to ban nudity in town. Kids were taking to hanging around the center of town with no clothes on. It made the national news for a while but the locals just shrugged it off for the most part. There are always going to be prudes that try to make a big issue out of such things. Here is one article from that time. Google will show you many more if you search for brattleboro vermont nudity. I actually really appreciate the lack of nudity laws. Not that Im aiming to go around wo clothes on but I am involved in a lot of sports that at times involve changing clothes in or around my car. With no antinudity laws I know I cant be harassed for changing from my work clothes to my biking kit in or standing next to my car before a ride. As long as you arent being lewd nobody can complain.  Edit Ive add that though Im not much of a nudist I do enjoy that there are certain beaches around here that are pretty much clothing optional.  Unfortunately the town of Brattleboro just built a baseball park next to one of them on the West River and now we are hearing that they will crack down on nude swimmers to save the children from having to confront such an atrocity.  ,vermont,chtbbe6,3,t5_2qqdd

Well I think thats out of their purview and so is the GMO issue. Ive mentioned this elsewhere but I do think it would be interesting to have labels that provide information about different steps in food production slave labor food miles did the manure come from a factory farm genetic engineering.  But these things dont directly affect human health so beyond the FDA so its up to me to find fair trade vegan kosher etc food.  For now the burdens on you get organic food and I dont see whats so much more important about you avoiding GMOs than me avoiding animal products. ,vermont,chx98v1,6,t5_2qqdd

Give the kids temporary asylum.  Give each kid a hearing to determine if they would be placed in mortal danger by being returned to their original country and if so grant them asylum.   That is the humane thing to do.  Id expect that most would grow up to be contributing members of society.  The average age in Vermont is . years.  We need young workers to have a strong economy that will create jobs for everyone.  The idea that these kids will take more that they will contribute over their lifespan is just poor economic reasoning.

1736221,0,t1_cjxxw7q,Im a resident of Stowe and all of the shops are on a main village street. At least most of the ones worth looking at. Stowes Main Street also has Christmas trees on every telephone pole during the winter. D its beautiful and very quaint. But on the price point I totally understand you. Holy shit. Almost everyone in town locals work at the mountain after their regular work so they can get a free season pass for them and their kids. Otherwise it would be impossible for them to even ski up there. However Stowe is one of the best places for that kind of vacation. Killington has recently had a rash of drug problems Jay Peak is very far out Bolton is...eh.. Smuggs has a lot of empty houses and storefronts. Sugarbush is very similar to Stowe except that its not situated in such a scenic location. Stratton Im not very familiar with but I understand that it is vert good skiing and geared towards vacationing. While I cant help but rep Stowe I honestly think that Stratton or Sugarbush would be the most bang for your buck. ,vermont,cjy0jub,1,t5_2qqdd

3897673,0,t3_34rj1p,Vermont is a hotspot for destination weddings so there are plenty of photographers out there that will charge very high prices.  I encountered people with prices ranging into the tens of thousands a couple of years ago.  This doesnt mean that there arent lessexpensive photographers out there but be prepared to sift through people charging a lot.One issue that will be more pronounced at the low end of the price scale is copyright.  Many photographers try to keep the copyright to the photos they take then charge less for shooting the wedding with the expectation that they will make money charging for prints.  If you dont have the copyright you wont be allowed to print your wedding photos yourself or post them on Facebook for example without the photographers permission.If you care about that ask for copyright up front and make that part of your contract.  In my experience many photographers were willing to do work for hire and give me the copyright and others werent.  Often the latter group appeared to fundamentally misunderstand copyright law.  copyright.gov is a great resource in particular the circular on works done for hire  Theres nothing wrong immoral or weird about you getting the copyright to photos youve hired someone to take.Good luck and congratulations!!,vermont,cr0khe7,0,t5_2qqdd

Estimates from the RAND report that the state paid for were between m annually and the longer we wait the lower that figure will likely be because other NE states may do it first. It will keep young people here. People are moving to CO because of this new industry its creating tons of jobs and provides something that many people want. Less young people would leave and we may actually get more people moving here. Again with increased taxes especially if we promote this well and get a craft weed economy like we do with beer cheese maple etc. then we could get even more money to improve our infrastructure.Im not sure how you cant see this?

The ones I can remember off the top of my head are that its illegal to discharge a firearm from a moving vehicle which is to prevent people from vehicle assisted hunting and that its illegal to fire across a state highway for what should be obvious reasons.

7825472,0,t3_4mclle,This is a terrible idea.  Religious cults should not be allowed to do what amounts to a takeover of townships.  This happened also in Lempster NH close to where I live.  An insular cult started in that town and befriended a bunch of locals bought up their land instituted their own budget and directives via majority at town meetings and by shoehorning their members into elected positions educating all their kids at their own private school while starving the local school of money and resources via their budgetkilling power on the various boardscouncils.  The townpeople started getting real pissy about that and started fighting back.  Because the cult is so insular and does not like attention they decided to move to some other area in northern Maine or Canada as I recall so they basically moved onto some other township they could exploit.  Because they were one of the main businesses in that town the massexodus left a lot of vacant buildings pulled away a lot of business and fucked the town budget further but the town has recovered somewhat on their own since then.  I also used to work at one of the big businesses owned by this cult just seasonal work but the small amount of time I spent there was enough for me.  The folks in the cult are very strange very StepfordWifelike.  Not saying thats a reason in and of itself to dislike them I simply started disliking them after I learned what they were doing to that town.Its shit like this which is the reason that I am not into having large religious collectives amassing in townships and forcing their will on the locals.

To me with that many people its not only a safety hazard in the water but a safety hazard on the road.  That tiny parking lot clearly cannot accommodate the visitors.I wasnt aware that this was privately owned land.  I dont understand why the land owners feel its the townstates issue to maintain and manage the property?  I get that they want to ensure people can visit the site and continue swimming for free whenever they want but with as many people visiting it as I saw on Saturday this dream seems a little too sunshine and roses for me.   ,vermont,d6w5bg4,1,t5_2qqdd

Honestly if there is such a creature as a Vermontwide realtor that would be ideal for us but I kinda doubt it.As for crime were from Albuquerque and it looks like even Rutland experiences half the crime were used to so that has not been a thing weve been checking.So we probably missed a good few places that were nearish a college and hospital and simply dont have a lot of real estate listings in the usual places people look.
