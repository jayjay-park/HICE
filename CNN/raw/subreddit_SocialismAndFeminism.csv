8384101,0,t3_4tjtxj,Not a bad article. I would suggest that emancipation from the double burden can only come once and for all in the form not of the voluntaristic redivision of domestic labour though that provides limited relief but of the socialisation of domestic labour. It must cease to be a privately performed service and gain recognition as socially necessary labour requiring social provision.,SocialismAndFeminism,d5pk7f3,1,t5_3extj
