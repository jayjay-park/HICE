5877164,0,t3_3vr0ca,The thing is he is being written as a man who sees what he wants and finds the way to get it. He will also protect his own interests with a murderous fire. He has done like one actually evil act by killing Veils parents but thats about it. Other then that he has just been a little nasty to people.

11703458,0,t3_66ztcg,Its probably to facilitate dramatic moments. But a canonical explanation could be that since Quin and Sunnys departure the Amadillo clippers are clearly not even close to as deadly as they once were. Under Ryders leadership the quality of their training has diminished. ,intothebadlands,dgmltlz,20,t5_37lui
