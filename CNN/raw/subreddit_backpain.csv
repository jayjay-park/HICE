6507013,0,t3_445k7s,A few things that Ive seen done Get a standing desk. Sitting can be hard for a lot of back problems. You can build it yourself. Get a heating pad that you can have warm your back even in your sleep. If you have pain getting up you need to find if theres a position that can make it easier. Either through a rail to pull yourself up or a way of sliding out.,backpain,czsdhkp,2,t5_2rdud
7826605,0,t3_4m9fir,HiHave you tried sitting on a kneeling chair at work? This will take the weight off your lower back and will force you to sit upright by default. As for remedies personally I would say strengthening the lower back and core has greatly helped me. There are exercises found here which you could take a look at www.weakbackbuilder.com However dont do any of the weighted ones. If you do anything I would suggest start with simple birddog exercise using body weight. However without knowing your history its difficult to say what stage you are at so maybe tell me a little about yourself? What do you do for your day job?Give me a bit more information about yourself and Ill try and give you some of my own experience  to see if it helps ...My journey regarding back pain can be found here incase you want to have a read thanks...,backpain,d3vrz9c,1,t5_2rdud
8419189,0,t1_d5txg6x,My doctor recommended me to a physiotherapist. I dont understand though everyone says things like if it hurts dont do it I want a damn diagnosis for once so I can actually attempt to fix something rather than stop doing everything I love just because it hurts. ,backpain,d5txwrj,2,t5_2rdud

9192788,0,t3_54frui,What kind of doctors or hospital does she go to? I am surprised they told someone to go to that BS acupuncture therapy. I know hospitals may have addressed where they can tell people to go to get acupuncture but officially its not a treatment at any legit hospital. Its is bunk pseudoscientific holistic medicine. Your mom should strongly insist that they offer her options for injection of steroid or evaluate whether she should get disc replacement surgery. It sounds extreme but I read those are actually the procedures proven to fix the real issue.,backpain,d8h957e,1,t5_2rdud
10086158,0,t1_dbgrm4f,HiThank you for your detailed replie. I have had this injury for yrs now. Sitting is OK but if my posture is bad it flames up really bad... and walking is usually fine. Its when it comes to standing around that the pain sets in. Clenching my buttocks and sucking my stomach in or tensing it can relieve the pain. If I lay on my back as if I was in a coffin the pain is bad. I can sleepy by laying on my side with a pillow between my legs. If I lay on my front its fine at first but after mins the pins and needles are too intense Merry Christmas! ,backpain,dbm8t5z,1,t5_2rdud
10556995,0,t3_5r42kg,Hi mate.  I have some experience with this.  Over the space of  years I went from having LL bulging to LS collapse LL and LL bulging.  It was all degenerative and without careful management will only get worse without surgery which Im yet to do.The pain you are experiencing is termed Sciatica which is the result of pressure being applied to the sciatic nerve root conveniently located at LS.  It would be a direct result of the degenerative disc at that location.If theyve recommended microdisectomy then that should mean the disc is still in tact and has not yet ruptured.  Ive read some very good stories about the success of microdisectomy and the instant relief of symptoms.  Im not so lucky as the disc has ruptured and Ill need a fusion cage to mend it.  They dont usually replace discs that low as its on too much of an angle.Sounds like you are otherwise fit and healthy.  I live a relatively sedentry lifestyle as I work in IT and have  kids...not a lot of time to exercise etc.  I also have complications with a dodgy hip so that makes it hard as well.Chances are if the amount of exercise and fitness you have maintained and still have symptoms I would say surgery should be considered.  The crazy thing is that you can be fine for weeks or months on end and then BAM you relapse and are in pain again for an undetermined amount of time.  It does my head in!Im  and KG.  Recently lost some weight and it has helped a little but not enough to be a long term solution.  I dont have much else to offer on it but happy to answer questions if you have any ,backpain,dd4r6jc,1,t5_2rdud
