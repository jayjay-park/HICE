I liked Bisco because it was small enough where we could walk back to our campsite during the day in between sets we wanted to see.

94533,0,t3_1v52pl,I went in . Oasis The Killers Franz Ferdinand and Kings of Leon were headlining. Kings of Leon ended up not playing due to a freak wind storm which was causing the stages to fall down. Arctic Monkeys played last year. Bands usually a good mix of big names with the smaller names often have an emphasis on dancier acts. Weather was great apart from that storm possibly too hot. Highs of  degrees and hard to sleep once the sun comes up. Music goes from around pm  am so probably not going to sleep much all week. Get a few of you together and share an apartment if you think it will cause you a problem. I slept in the campsite next to the festival site and loved it. Best to get an umbrella for the beach and try to rest there in the day. Beach is quite nice and sea good for swimming as well especially early in the week... later it gets messy. Be prepared for some questionable food in the town. it used to be that only one or two of the many restaurants served nice food and it was quite expensive for eating out generally so try and eat from supermarkets if youre looking to save. Alcohol? Pop into Lidl its probably more now but white rum and vodka full strength cl bottles were bought for .. I think in the arena it was  for a Heineken so bear that in mind and predrink in the campsite. Locationwise we flew into Reus I think and got a train down. Was not a problem. Buy train tickets as early as you can. Looks like theyve got a handy getting there section on the website now would have been handy back then   ... Enjoy it if you decide to go! By the way Optimus Alive is a slightly smaller festival innear Lisbon on the same weekend which often shares most of the headliners. Its a bit smaller and a bit cheaper. worth knowing about anyway  ,festivals,cep6y52,2,t5_2re9k

Pretty Nectar Auction house and Bassnectar Marketplace are some of my favorites.  Most of them are private and you need to be invited but its not hard to do.

Coachellas search is still relatively light though nothing like what Summer Sets sounds like.  they always just have us get out pull maybe a couple bags out of the bag so they can get a better look in the trunk and thats it.  this year they didnt even go that far.  Theyve never actually searched our bags or anything.  Honestly the most annoying part is they always try to pull the lame We can smell the weed do you want to do this the easy way or the hard way kind of thing.

What I know about Paaspop is that it is usually quite cold and probably very muddy.  So bring boots and a sweater.If you want to see something cool go to the Memphis Maniacs. They do live mashup of classice rock song pop songs dance songs. Something else completely crazy is Kees van Hondt he makes strange party music it is always party with him.Obliviously I want to recommend The Bloody Beetroots. Other good dutch dance acts are Party squad and Yellow Claw. I would avoid Kensington it is just generic rock. But everybody in the Netherlands are loving them. So expect it to be very crowded at that stage when they play. This goes as well for Anouk. Just a rock chick nothing special but some reason everybody loves her. ,festivals,coxqu8q,2,t5_2re9k

6243005,0,t1_cyz4k9d,What festivals out there are  beside Mysteryland and Tomorroworld?I really felt like there was a larger police presence at ML then at most festivals Ive been too as well. I felt like it came with hosting it at a fairly commercialized venue like that. Then again as these things get bigger and more scrutinized police presence is only going to increase. And I saw the stages from the year before they didnt strike me as all that impressive. The ticket price itself was ridiculous for a   day festival beyond the birdy bucks. Plus Im sure Id need to buy water at some point inside the festival grounds......considering they dont let you take any in seeing as they only take birdy bucks not sure how Id get around that one.Curious to see if Friday is a full day at this years or just at night like last year. I dont think Mysteryland is the worst I just think there are other festivals where Id rather spend my money. edit cant forget that    mile winding walk from the campsite to the festival grounds. Wasnt crazy about that. ,festivals,cyz9fda,1,t5_2re9k

We had no problem sneaking booze in the campground they just seach your car on the way in and the lack of a search made it easy to take that booze into the venue.  It was kind of nice really.

I wish I had stayed.I think it might be harder for you since you are in another country. I would look online because some times you can find people to meet up with before you even go there maybe even someone who speaks your native language not that you need that but I dont know it could be nice.Overall I say go for it.

Doesnt push too much of a scene or experience and lets the campers figure out what its gonna be like.

9341695,0,t3_58bjhd,Great area to stay in as it is right by the festival. New Orleans has a ton of things going on Halloween weekend so it will be crazy. I always have the toughest time getting a cab or an uber on Halloween weekend NYE or any of the super krewe mardi gras parades. Other people have suggested Frenchmen st in the quarter which is cool. I wouldnt say that it is where the locals go but it is still a nicer touristy area to catch live music and drinks but not with all of the Have some NOLA shoved down your throat feel to it. Frenchmen st and Bourbon street will be crowded as fuck. You could always go back to BSJ if you get tired of the chaos that is the French Quarter on Halloween. One of the most beautiful things about New Orleans is that there are bars everywhere and the locals are in all of these bars. The costumes are never boring and the drinks are always flowing.The last time Ive been to Voodoo was in . I believe Live Nation had taken it over started that year or the year before and it was a cluster fuck. The grounds seemed more closed in than it did in previous years and the will call line on Friday was a  hour wait to get in.  Food stuff to check definitely get a poboy. Parkway is pretty good and Parasols is also really good. Biscuits and Buns on Banks is tasty as fuck. Head over to the Bywater and get a sandwich from Kebab or go to Drag Brunch at the country club on Saturday its the greatest thing ever and swing by and check out Crescent Park. It has some really good views of the city. Any more questions let me know! Oh yeah wear costumes. Everyone else will be.,festivals,d904l6w,2,t5_2re9k

9991979,0,t1_db8ton0,a oneday festival doesnt exist unless youre going only one day out of the  days in its entirety but i dont suggest tht to anyone just because by the time you get a hang of the venue and found some cool people to hang with its over. which fest were you thinking about going to anyway? and yes i have gone to a camping fest by myself  nights and  days before and it was the best decision i ever made. i met the chillest group of people via someone i followed on ig who i recognized almost instantly. he then introduced me to even more people that actually live near me so now i have a whole rave family for when i go to local shows on the weekends. i highly suggest going to an edm showrave near you before going to fest solo just so youre not ridiculously overwhelmed and use to the scene edmtrain.com updates edm shows daily in every city so check it outtttt. lastly a person tent is only  at walmart and camping is cheaper if youre going solo. paying for a hotel all by yourself for one night is too much esp if you want to continue to travel afterwards like to Amsterdam  where are you from girllll? im from philly so I go to pretty much every fest on the east coast but never yet to the west or international so that you understand where my perspective is,festivals,db9ze51,1,t5_2re9k

Id say around  I may start pushing the limits. But in todays world of being glued to electronics theres nothing quite like a live music experience to make you feel something so why deprive yourself?That said if youre trying to be with people more your agespeed theres a few factors to consider. First I guess it depends what shows youre going to. Not to throw shade at any artists or anything but if youre going to a Lil Yachty or a Marshmello show youll definitely run into younger crowds thats just their fan base. Also the GA Pit area will definitely have more kids and the seated areas if they exist will have older crowds. At festivals the closer you get to the rails the younger the crowd the further back parts amp vip areas will have older crowds.,festivals,dgwt607,4,t5_2re9k
