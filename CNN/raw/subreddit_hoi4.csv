7618473,0,t3_4jjllu,Hell of a video. I was not familiar with this campaign. I loved the bicycle blitzkrieg. I think Percivals biggest failures were . His hesitation to meet the Japanese in Thailand. This was a serious opportunity wasted as had he inflicted some of losses he accomplished in Malaya the Japanese force would have been severely hampered for the rest of the campaign given their manpower disadvantage at the outset.. His lackadaisical management of bridge destruction. Had he acknowleged the juggernaut he was facing from the outset and started the process of defensive preparations earlier he may have been better able to slow the Japanese advance. .  Trying to defend the whole island of singapore. A better strategy may have been to hold a large force in reserve and only pickets on the beaches and then once knowing more about the enemys disposition execute a counterattack. Presumably Percival should have had the advantage of knowing the terrain of the island and could have capitalized on it. Moreover although allowing the landing would not be ideal being able to concentrate his attack would have at least offered him a fighting chance.. Not playing to the strengths of his army and responding to Japanese jungle tactics. Perhaps he could have tasked his singapore battalions to clearing away jungle and other disadvantageous terrain to make better defensive use of his artillery.If you were Percival defending the malayan peninsula what would you guys have done differently?,hoi4,d386ir6,2,t5_2zvvb

7656184,0,t1_d3cbfqw,gtParadox was even okay with a Stellaris mod unlocking DLC content so I doubt its going to be a problem.I think you are misinterpreting Paradoxs lack of actionlack of moderation with an acceptance that unlocking DLC with mods is ok when in fact it is not.

8388023,0,t3_4ugt6p,On point  I would like to add that the Allies will not guarantee nations if the person declaring war on them has not generated world tension. Essentially you get  invasion for free. They will guarantee andor invite to the allies if you join a faction which has generated world tension usually Axis so get your conquests first.You can semiabuse this system by declaring war against multiple nations at the same time so they do not get time to guarantee the second after you attack the first which they would otherwise do but ofcourse this can only be done if your army is large enough to support it classic example for this is Netherlands vs Belgium and Luxembourg.As for point  I can think of a few reasons why this would be the case. Justifying war goals are usually  PP. A coup if you had to pay it up front would be  PP right?. And partyboosting is not a timed thing like justifying and doing a coup is you can party boost indefinitely. So in the case of party boosting it makes sense because how long you boost is always going to vary. For Coups it makes sense because the upfront cost would be very high. And for war justifications the cost is low enough that putting it up front is viable. Now whether it SHOULD be up front or not Im neutral. I am just saying is that I can see WHY this is the case and I dont think its much of a big deal.Do like point  especially in the far regions of Asia it really matters where in the province your Air Bases pop up.,hoi4,d5q1tw8,1,t5_2zvvb

8560948,0,t1_d6becm4,On point .During the war Artillery was relatively few and far between. Even x artillery on  infantry is far more artillery then most nations employed in their divisions. I would recommend you watch this  if you want to roleplay historical division templates.As for combat width the reason for this width is because of the width granted to battles. Normally a battle has  width which can scale up to   and  with various flanks or even higher I think. This means that typically speaking anything that scales with  is good being   and  though if youre really crazy you can always try make something closer to  combat width or something that scales to  like . You will get a penalty in combat for exceeding combat width there is a limit on how far combat width will be exceeded but as a general rule if you keep your combat widths to scale with both  and the subsequent higher numbers to account for flanks you will never suffer that penalty and optimize your frontage in the battle itself.A simple template for a mobile division could be x Motorized x width  x SelfPropelled Artillery x  x Tank x which rounds up to  width exactly. As for the SPGs and Tanks the width is the same no matter which weight of vehicle you use though obviously Heavy Tanks are the slowest and Light Tanks the fastest. Motorized goes at . kmh Mechanized I at . Mechanized II at . Mechanized III at . Light Tank  at . Light Tank  at . and Light Tank  at . Medium Tank  at . Medium Tank  and  at . and Heavy tanks go at . for the  version and . for the later ones with Super Heavy Tanks trailing somewhere at . if I recall correctly. The speeds can change slightly depending on Chief of Army if you have a guy for maneuver and the Mobile Warfare doctrine should you choose to use it.I personally prefer working with  combat width particularly for the mobile armored divisions because it allows you to fill in the combat width a lot more cleanly bumping up the effectiveness in a way that you couldnt replicate with two divisions of  width. But obviously these divisions will become extremely supplyhungry and are totally unsuited for areas like Africa or Asia.,hoi4,d6bp1vr,1,t5_2zvvb

For example the northern half of the island Tokyo is on provides  local supply and because the AI tends to run basic infantry which is very low on supply it is quite conceivable that even with no infrastructure of any kind The north half of tokyo alone could easily support a  division army effectively. Obviously my speculation is not likely to be precise. I havent seen your game situation and I have no concept of the time scale or level of troops involved.

I did join Axis after that but I dont think it actually helped me in any way. AI is so bad I had to take  of Soviet Union myself and thats on Veteran. After that I declared and took Iran Mongolia and some other countries then British Raj and then China. Germany was of no help really. A lot of Axis nations sent me there troops but basically their troops are shit and mostly I used them just for garrison duty. US joined the Allies and there were hundreds of US submarines that screwed with my transports so I basically stopped importing things and wasnt even able to transport my own resources for a while which there were tons especially after taking the Dutch Indies. So I built a lot of destroyers and a few cruisers and killed all the subs then started building up my transports again. Meanwhile I had also invaded UK again with no help from the Germans. I found it quite hard to invade from the south it was much easier from the north I was able to gain control of the North Sea and Scotland was poorly defended.After that I started planning the US invasion. I did it via Iceland and Greenland. The sea areas were really not protected there even though both the US and UK had much larger fleets than I. I had built up a considerable fighter force by then tho  or so fighters and although I kept losing them in the battles I had enough production to keep up with the losses.Basically you dont need to build a single civilian factory or dockyard you only build military factories in the beginning but you gain hundreds of factories from your conquests.Once I landed somewhere in Labrador I built a port there to ship troops and supplies there. The way you fight is that you dont just push your enemy back you actively find ways to encircle large portions of their armies and annihilate them.So after the US and Canada were done there was a peace conference and although I had the most points Germany also had quite a bit so I let Germany claim Poland the UK and lots of small islands I waited a few rounds and took everything else. So in my opinion Germany actually got more than they deserved for their effort. I mean in the  or so years of war all the rest of the Axis armies and there were easily over a thousand divisions were not able to take even Greece.I dont think Im going to continue with this game but the next logical thing would be to leave the Axis and take down Germany first. They have at least  times as many divisions but the way they fight Im not even worried DIm currently trying to do the same with Estonia and without joining the Axis D,hoi4,d92ws57,1,t5_2zvvb

While youre at it grabbing Belgium to get to the Netherlands and grabbing the Netherlands for the rubber monopoly is probably the best route. From there I build up infrastructure in Labrador and invade Canada which thankfully brings in the US so you can take them both out then go down through Central and South Anerica.

9675724,0,t3_5dmakw, Yes casualties drain manpower as much as broken equipment drains stockpiled equipment. Only equipment. Deploying planes cost manpower not close to realistic as a few hundred planes cost like k manpower. Planes lost means you lose manpower. But compared to the ground battle this is an insignificant number. Lost ships means the manpower that is given under service manpower for each ship type is lost. No idea about repaired ships tho. Id assume damaged ships dont cost manpower. But then again these numbers are insignificant compared to the millions you lose as major in land battles. when theyre first deployed their manpower comes from their home country. In battle the reinforcement will drain your manpower. This believed to no be intentional though nobody from paradox has commented on that matter AFAIK. In my games I stepped away from using expeditionary forces because of exactly that problem. I just accept very few of them and use them to garrison and fight resistance. You can gain additional manpower by taking certain national focuses especially when you go down the fascist tree. Also take in mind that conscription laws not only increase manpower but also have downsides like weakening your industry. Sometimes its worth considering to go for a more equipment based army  for instance Marines need less manpower than regular infantry but offer better combat stats especially across rivers or naval invasions. They just need more equipment if your prodiction allows that. In some cases puppeting instead of annexing makes sense as the puppet will jave access to core population whereas after annexation you will only have access to the noncore population. Make sure to understand the difference between core and noncore population.,hoi4,da5qi9a,9,t5_2zvvb

Killing the Japanese navy especially in single player as the USA is pretty straightforward just gather up all your ships in one giant doomstack build a couple of modern ships to go with them particularly carriers with good planes but battleships work equally well and they will just destroy anything they run into.On the short term Venezuela through the Focus is never a bad idea but it doesnt give you anything you particularly need beyond denying trade for the Axis and getting some army experience.,hoi4,dbp06xp,2,t5_2zvvb

Lots of political power lots of interventions youre the steamroller that everyone is trying to build up to stop.Russia also starts out pretty unstable but becomes an unstoppable monstrosity of industry later in the game. Some general tips Kaisserreich expects you to fully annex nations in peace deals. Always do this. It means the game logic doesnt get broken. After the peace conference where you annex them the game will give you a set of decisions about how to partition the land whether to puppet etc. If you choose to occupy territory you will often be granted cores on the territory later in the year at the cost of significant political power. This gives you more manpower! HUGE change to game style from vanilla. Ministers have an affiliation. They all have chances to fire events that increase popularity of their affiliation. So stack your government with ministers with the same affiliation and eventually your party will be very popular Many of the ministers companies and military staff are incredibly strong. Bonuses exist such as  speed for civilian factories  research time . daily army experience  artillery firepower etc. In Kaisserreich nobody can join a faction except through scripted events. This totally changes the dynamic of the game as you can have lots of small wars going on and are much more free to move. Be careful though as a major near Germany Germany gets lots of prescripted opportunities to intervene when someone is causing trouble in its sphere of influence.  The two major Syndicalist  Countries Britain and France have  subfactions. Due to engine limitations the  syndicalist factions are coded as various nonsyndicalist ideologies in your party support.

If its intended then Germany should kick the Russian Empire out of the Axis and actually declare war. Right now Germany spends  days doing...nothing. They threaten war with an Axis member which certainly be newsworthy especially with the Italians and Japanese and then refuse to declare it which undermines their credibility. Failing to declare a war youve been threatening is already punished by the game.

Italy is land locked to its ally Japan due to the Suez and Gibraltar being under British control and Japan makes the Axis the most divided faction in terms of furthest allies.But Ireland would be the most useful ally in an IrishAmericanother alliance due to the majority of the war being in Europe apart from Japan which the US has islands to deal with them any American nation would struggle to get involved in those wars without some foothold in EuropeAfrica even if it was a free Iceland.,hoi4,dgqcz1j,1,t5_2zvvb

11797563,0,t1_dgx6wf4,On the plus side they get big stacking penalties from exceeding combat width from trying to shove  divisions  into a small area encirclement of multiple divisions is very easy because of this and the sea . Ive encircled  UOB divisions in KR although I believe that was as Canada. I find its doable with  wellequipped divisions and air superiority. I prefer to land in Scotland as it gives you an opportunity to encircle UOB troops in both Aberdeenshire and further north by driving them against he sea. It just takes a little skillful micro. Theres other places as well as you move down Britain. Once youve destroyed enough divisions their defence will crumble and youll be able to roll them in a couple weeks.
