3137753,0,t1_comxkxu,Ah fair point I feel bad I didnt think about that first. Still would be somewhat surprised if they only ever made one chess set. Its of course a lot easier to churn out multiple of a thing rather than just one.  Still cool though and thanks for the pictures.,MedievalHistory,con83mu,2,t5_2sa8g

7583257,0,t1_d345jlk,Firstly they were all lumped as Franks regardless of their ethnicity when they went outside. Anna Comena did not differentiate between pure Franks and Normans when she spoke of the frankish cavalry charges.Secondly its false that the original Franks were the predecessors of french nobility as it came from all different regions. Case in point the norman Malherbes. Thats why assumed OP did not know any better and used Franks as a portmanteau of the early nobility.,MedievalHistory,d346gsx,3,t5_2sa8g

8782787,0,t1_d730kzw,Look even if its not a legally explicit triumvirate they know who they are and many others likely know as well. They dont need to differentiate themselves they know what their power is. Its like the mob they dont walk around with business cards that say mobster on them they say ImportExport  you get what Im saying?If the treaty or whatever establishing it explicitly names a triumvirate then simply add it to their titles Lord Joe Count of the Rock Triumvir of the Holy Church etc.,MedievalHistory,d73iqiq,1,t5_2sa8g

10825412,0,t3_5usveg,In this popular history James Hannam attempts to provide a revisionist study for this vital era in European history. Cleverly diagramming the progression of human knowledge during these misunderstood centuries Hannam effectively destabilizes outdated notions and gives his readers a clearer picture of the Age of Faith.,MedievalHistory,ddwkcja,2,t5_2sa8g
