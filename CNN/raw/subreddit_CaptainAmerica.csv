7297672,0,t3_4dyhkl,Gun laws are a bad example. Superheroes can reach beyond nuclear level. If anything its a registration of nukes world wide and making sure nobody actually use them as the results would be far worse than  the death of children in Stamford Connecticut. The hulk on an unstoppable rampage is a major concern and people who can wipe out the entire human race should register. The names should go to the government but rather a government body for superheroes. An that party should be ruled by either Tony Steve or both. Because their identities is far safer in their hands and most superheroes trust Steve. A compromise is the solution here. Supervillains dont follow the rules they break them and do things that also go far beyond the death of children in Stamford Connecticut. Yeah Tony had the right idea but him alone controlling everything isnt effective either. To much a risk for everyones identity and take out him and everything would fall apart. Agree. There have to be otherwise the government or the people themselves can turn on the superheroes once they feel they are a threat by that point every superhero would be criminal in the public eye. A criminal that cant be controlled or captured as nothing is holding them back. The result would be a war like the Civil War that was meant to prevent things like that but someone superheroes was willing to fight the government to the point the people said enough! all because they didnt want to sacrifice their identity for a cause beyond themselves. Tony has experience being publicly known as Ironman and unlike Batman having the villain know your identity can reduce casualties as they would target them and those close to them instead if the people. Something both Batman and Captain America will never understand as their identity is a secret.The laws has to protect the people while also uniting the superheroes to a along with getting government support as they fight for a common goal while watching over the most powerful superheroes out there. As youve said the general public cant protect themselves they are victims of every fight they involve themselves in. The government body for superheroes should be controlled by superheroes and any law involving them should go trough them. They are the most powerful people so demanding something will result in things like Civil Wars. Its how it started to begin with they disapproved it and since they are a threat it was reasonable to classify uncooperative superheroes as criminals since nobody controlled them not even a superhero it was that way until Tony started fighting for the cause. They where loose canons fighting loose canons while creating destruction of most places they fight. So youre right wether they like to admit it or not they are as much a threat as any supervillain. Kinda touched that already but I dont think the government itself could protect the families of superheroes unless they create something just as powerful but then youd risk an advanced military state.Team Iron Man. ,CaptainAmerica,d27p201,1,t5_2sb1s
