28581,0,t3_1ufpkr,I think the oven is going to make the fridge work harder them being next to each other. May be trivial.I dont like the bed rails and what looks like a twin bed. Too much like childhood. I can picture no nookie in that crib. Id take that loft and extend the board under the mattress out a foot with a token rail at the edge of that giving some room to hang off at least one side of the bed without hitting a rail or falling off. Where does this thing go? What does the outside of this microcosm look like?You cant watch TV while youre at your workstation under the bed its over your shoulder.

125731,0,t1_ceska70,To answer this briefly. I would love to have a fireplace that was aesthetically pleasing and heated the house but the most important part is the heating of the house. I guess I was hoping that there were decorative fireplaces that heated the house the same way a regular NG furnace does  heat water have a pump that circulates it to different parts of the house and use slant fins to radiate or something like that.I was hoping to do everything just like that except use wood instead of natural gas thats it.I think distributing the heat is a big problem and I wanted to see if there were obvious solutions out there. Another big one I would presume is the loss of heat. It seems a fireplace just burns stuff and then lets most of the heat escape through the chimney. it would be great to recapture some of that with water and then circulate it. Im also not sure if a fan in the house would be enough to circulate the heat especially if there were different rooms in the house. I dont really want  different furnaces either.Thanks for all the info though I think this is a good start to nose around.,TinyHouses,cesqz4m,2,t5_2rab5

260041,0,t1_cf7nfrf,Zoning is a government handout to big business to fuck the little guy.See the way this used to be handled was that every particle of soot or smell or criminal that entered your property from your neighbor was an actionable tort that you could take them to court for.  Back in the s farmers in England were shutting down coal furnaces left and right because of the pollution impacting their crops.  The amount of success that they had was ginormous.  The coal guys were petrified of the farmers lawsuits.  The first attempts at scrubbers to capture and neutralize coal soot and pollution were invented in the s to keep the farmers from suing them into the poorhouse.  Unfortunately scrubbers werent perfected until the s. Todays tough environmental laws were nothing  NOTHING  compared to how tough pollution control was in the s.People think of the Industrial Revolution as some smog choked helllhole  well that was after the owners of the coal furnaces bribed the government to create the first zoning laws and the first pollution laws which effectively shut down the ability of farmers to sue polluters into oblivion saying in effect if youre in this zone and if youre lying less than this legal limit you can pollute as much as you want and no one can sue you.I lived next to a whorehouse in Peru.  The owners made sure to keep their patrons from committing crimes in the neighborhood and strove to make their business as downlow as possible.  Kids would play futbol in the whorehouses front yard.But in places where zoning has concentrated all the whorehouses in one place eg. Amsterdam you dont have a place anyone would want to live.Zoning also created our current car culture hourlong commutes and the massive air pollution that comes from it.Fuck zoning.,TinyHouses,cf7pndn,6,t5_2rab5

1292424,0,t3_28vzob,As an experiment I set up a small solar system for my chicken coup. I know this doesnt exactly answer your question directly but this is what I learned. Solar systems have the following critical problem. They produce electricity when you dont really need it and produce no electricity when you need it the most. The only way to get them to be useful is to have an extensive battery array and this is where the cost hits you pretty hard. I got most of my components from my father so the were free but even so I will never hit a break even point. Ever.  Cost wise it would have been better to run a beefy extension cord from the house and buy electrons from the power company.  As long as batteries are expensive and have a relatively short life span solar systems will never be cost effective. It doesnt matter how cheap or efficient your solar panels are.Now if youre in a situation where power is a long long ways away from where you want to be and it would be s or s of thousands of dollars to run wires then it might be worth it. ,TinyHouses,cif0j28,6,t5_2rab5

Ill second the condensationicing issues you will have with the thermal difference in those thin walls with the lack of insulation the difficult need to find a way to keep all your pipes and holding tanks from freezing heat tape will not work on plastic and the idea of a depreciating asset with a full drivetrain to service and maintain even without use. Ill add you will have no porch or stoop so you will need to keep a walk shoveled in the grass to your door and unshoe and deepclean the dogs paws several times a day.Many counties allow for small motherinlaw outbuildings on properties with existing houses that do not need to meet minimum area building codes. As this structure would increase your moms property value perhaps she could bankroll the materials and you could spend the rest of the year planning and getting a slab foundation in then start building in the spring and be out of your condo and in a comfy insulated ownedhome space by next winter.,TinyHouses,cizc9u7,3,t5_2rab5

Its an idea I like because you can also add builtin cabinets above the bed since headroom is no longer an issue. Plus youre not really off grid if you have to buy alcohol for your stove. Thats the problem I have with propane. Youre still reliant on some industrial infrastucture somewhere else. For me wood was the only option unfortunately.

3578493,0,t3_318oaw,Do you really feel like you need to live in the same house forever? I guess some people do but I certainly dont. I move about once a year and Im hoping that I would move less often once I find a space that Im really happy with. But who knows? So being able to expand later really isnt a big deal. I would easily be able to buy a larger house down the line with the money I save by living in a tiny house even just for  or  years.Even for average people they usually sellbuy a new house every  years. Kids dont really need that much space until you have multiple andor they are larger. Babies are happy cosleeping with you and you should keep them close by anyway. So in that sense if you build a tiny house wait several years get pregnant and have a baby and then move when the kid is big enough for you to need more space... you might have already stayed somewhere for  years.For me small means that I dont need to compromise on any features. Can lighting throughout. Whole house speakers. Radiant floor heating throughout. Hardwood floors without any transition pieces. Etc. We are using an alternate tread staircase rather than a ladder and that may be an issue one day... but I seriously dont think its reasonable to plan  years ahead. And worse comes to worse Ill keep a bed in the living room e.g. for pregnancy.Lastly I think it is incredibly empowering to build your own home. You know exactly where everything else and that its built to your standard. You gain so much more understanding of how things work. This translates to renovating larger homes as well.Do I think a tinysmall home is the right answer for everyone?

4174318,0,t3_38lnif,Something to think aboutTiny homes are generally not a good investment. There are a few people here who will disagree with me but I firmly believe this. You dont build sweat equity. Theyre extremely difficult to sell when youre ready for an upgrade whether its a nicer tiny home or a larger home. For most part people who buy or build a tiny home do it because theyre interested in the lifestyle. Not because theyre looking to get away from renting. And speaking of this is where renting has its advantage youre not responsible for most depends on your lease terms and where you live maintenance and repair costs. If the roof leaks youre not responsible for fixing it. If your pipes burst ditto. If a tree falls on your houseapt building ditto. And you dont have to mow the lawn repaint the home etc. While you dont build equity true you can still save money by going this  of my paycheck wouldve gone toward my home improvement. Ill pretend this is my equity and stick it in a saving account you dont touch. Theres your pseudoequity that you can put toward your first home Thats assuming of course you find an apartment that fits your budget. Anyway back to the tiny homecampers. Campers like tiny homes dont hold their value very well but they are more common and more...accepted. Theyre a bit easier to sell. The downside? Expensive to repair often poorly insulated problematic if youve cold winters and you are often stuck renting space in a RV or mobile home lot. Which means youll have a similar living situation to apartments  very little privacy noisy neighbors etc.And on top of that depending on what town youre in you may be limited in where you can go. Dont like the lot manager? Its not that easy to just up and move. Some towns and cities have limited number of RV parks. Just food for thought. ,TinyHouses,crw2ur6,23,t5_2rab5

You could essentially not worry about how level the ground is just build a raised wood deck with sunken support posts that would essentially serve as your foundation. If built properly it would last many years.Or if your looking for concrete honestly your best bet is to just call around to local concrete companies and get a quick over the phone estimate. I do it all the time they will even answer all of your questions.Let me know if you need any more help! Cheers!Edit Also generally when pouring out a full foundation the ground is leveled and flattened by large steamrollers or whatnot. And then forms are made rebar etc etc. Or you can have something poured like a patio which is generally a  thick piece which is much thinner than traditionally used for residential conatruction. Sometimes they are used for pavillions the floors for pole barns sometimes or even other lightweight structures. The cost is also drastically cheaper.,TinyHouses,d1b6xdo,1,t5_2rab5

Oh! by putting the stove under the stairs good space saving but.... you make it hard to vent the moisture from cooking. Id put it against an outer wall instead. Your shower is skinny so you wont have a lot of elbow room. More room! They make a standard  shower. That also determines your elbow room while sitting on the can. More elbow room! I dont like feeling squished when Im reading. D Otherwise really you just have a lot of wasted floor space. Youll find that you walk through it but dont use it. Why pay for it? And if you wind up in a side yard smaller gives you more options for placement. Oh,TinyHouses,d3hr3g5,1,t5_2rab5

When it comes to releasing energy at the atomic level if nuclear fission is any indicator inefficiency is the least of your worry.

So while one county might have the perfect plot of land in what appears to be nature but only a  minute drive from town might be the perfect spot but their laws require at least SF house.  Another county just a little further away might only require SF.  So I think knowing some details about your house will be the first step. Does the county require a foundation? Does it allow for any off grid stuff? What internet service providers are available in the area? wish Id checked into that one before getting my current place... the only internet provider is a local gig that cant get me more than MB.So my advice will be to come up with a list of things you absolutely need about your house the concompromises such as it needs to be on public water instead of a well andor septic it needs at least cable internet etc.  Then start looking for areas that meet those needs and wants.,TinyHouses,dbin7vf,4,t5_2rab5

11004921,0,t1_defbr9f,I built a tiny house and currently have it for sale. After  months Ive had hundreds of contacts with people who are interested but the common denominator no one has the financial ability to purchase. This is in NJ right next to you and this state is one of the wealthiest in the country. So take it for what its worth.I had a meeting with the woman who runs the tiny house Meetup group in NJ and has been involved heavily in the tiny house movement for many years. She knows TONS of people interested in the movement.She says the movement is FILLED with Dreamers but very few have the financial ability to buy a tiny house. Thats exactly what Im seeing lots of tire kickers and sightseers but when it comes to being able to get approved for financing none can make that happen due to really poor credit scores.,TinyHouses,defdke3,1,t5_2rab5

11374586,0,t1_dfl8fvv,I dont think this has much to do with the current POTUS or the former one for that matter.However I think your angst is fully understood by most of us on here.While it is possible we may fight a righteous war and maybe even win for Tiny Houses it is troubling that while many people in the system are friendly to us it seems like the long term trajectory of society lets call it a network is rather worrying.Its plain old just getting hard to get shit done. And thats even true for communists attempting to build microutopias as it is for the more libertarian types. This is a broadspectrum problem. Everybodys hunkering down scaling back their ambitions.Consider this    devised by Leonardo da Vinci      different angleIts housed in this So I ask myself if we are really standing on the shoulders of giants then we should be able to improve on that. Or we should be able to make things like this for more people.That gives me pause.This leads me to Peter Thiel an unusual Silicon Valley billionaire who has an explanation called the Technological Stagnation Thesis.Its not on hardly anybodys radar but its taken seriously in many important circles and has the value of explaining a lot of what has happened over the past four decades in a somewhat disturbing light.A debate between Thiel and the then CEO of Google Page agrees with Thiel but is CTOOne of the most fascinating discussions Ive heard between Thiel and a Harvard HistorianA debate between Thiel and SVs other largest venture capitalistDiscussion between Thiel and Tyler Cowen an influential economistIf you watch those and want to talk about it more you can PM me.,TinyHouses,dflaflg,4,t5_2rab5
