4277408,0,t3_39z77e,Special thanks to usideburnsy for originally creating this.How to read this chartFor the offensive chart if your team is below the line that intersects the Average data point then your team is considered above average for offense in the league. Likewise if your team is above the line your team is below average offensively for the league.For the defensive chart read it the opposite. Above the Average line means your team is above average defensively. If below the line your team is below average defensively.Teams in the same band between two lines are considered to have similar effectiveness offensively or defensively.Switchbacks ranking as one of the top offenses in the league thus far. Defense a bit on the negative side but about as close as you can get to the league average without actually being the league average. ,SwitchbacksFC,cs7s6og,1,t5_31d4j
