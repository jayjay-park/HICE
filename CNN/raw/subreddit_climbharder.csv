This increase in mass be it from water retention or muscle mass would have a detrimental impact on climbing at a high level. You are right in saying that it increases energy or perhaps power allowing someone to train harder.  Perhaps using creatine during a training cycle and then eliminating the use for a redpoint cycle would be advantageous.Do you know of anyone that discusses this?  ,climbharder,cfcs53t,3,t5_2s5er

4624518,0,t1_ctd3ag4,gtcan normally only send them cleanly on top rope...Theres another issue. Get off the top ropes. If you want to learn how to sport climb you need to sport climb. Top roping is not the same.Im not suggesting you try laps like you said you dont think endurance is the issue. Based on everything youve said it sounds like you have plenty of strength and plenty of endurance you just dont really have a good grasp on how to sport climb. Top roping will only make things worse because youll never get to practice relaxing when youre above bolts you wont get to practice clipping technique which is a huge part of it and you wont get to practice chunking routes based on clips which is another part of it.Seriously burn the top rope. Lead climb exclusively or go bouldering. People try to make excuses for why they toprope but I have yet to hear one that was compelling other than I use an autobelay toproped to get my ARC training in. That one is a decent reason. But trying to practice sport climbing on a top rope is like learning how to do motorcross with training wheels.Sport climbing is  mental  technical and  physical anyway. When you toprope you lose almost all the mental gains and a good chunk of technical gains too. EDIT TO ADDIt sounds like your issue is a lack of practice. Dont worry about turning these things into workouts. Think of them as practice sessions. You need to teach yourself how to sport climb efficiently. Pick a route that you can do all the moves on but is still hard Id expect that if youre sending Vs outside then you should be able to do Vs and Vs without too much work and Id expect you to be flashing Vs and Vs. If youre flashing Vs and Vs then you should be able to do every move on  of the as and bs in the States on youre first try.So pick a a or a b and start by just getting to the top. If you come across crux sections do them a few times learn the moves. Dont worry about how many times you fall and its okay to take if you need to rework a section but dont take because your pumped or scared. Once you get to the top the first time rest up and then try it again. The second time you try the route youre trying to get as far as you can without falling. Remember all your crux beta and try to do it efficiently. Dont take this time unless you realize your crux beta is bad and want to find a new way of doing it but you should have done this on the first run. Otherwise youll push yourself until you either send or fall. Taking whippers is a big part of this practice. As time goes on youll know when youre redlining and youll find a stance to recover youll know when to gun it and when to move more slowly. Most importantly you wont be taking when youre above a bolt due to fear because youll be used to the feeling of being pumped out and looking at a  foot fall and youll be able to deal with it. ,climbharder,ctdhsoo,2,t5_2s5er

7097845,0,t1_d1kw42v, calories under BMR over a month so averaging  calories a day deficit. Its intense but not as intense as youre thinking.In other words I estimated each of our BMRs using starting height and weight as a ballpark then compared our cumulative calorie consumption to the total that it would be if we ate our BMRs each day. So my BMR is roughly  calday where Stephens is . I have averaged about  calories a day where stephen has averaged . Of course climbing intensely burns a lot more than that. But really youd be surprised how little food you actually need to continue to work out when losing weight over a short period. Again you have to be careful with it. Im not advocating everyone just crash diet right now. We modified our training during this period to focus on muscle recruitment rather than strength as we probably would be compromising hypertrophy anyway being at a calorie deficit.

7138029,0,t3_4cvw5n,I think you can use ARC training at different intensities for different purposes including low intensity for active recovery and higher and sustained intensity for spurring greater physiological response.  For the first I would say that I am climbing at low intensity to correspond to about  number grades easier than my current best OS level and in the more intense version I am varying the intensity but about  number grade higher than the low intensity version.  say for example  a best a low intensity a high intensity   After low intensity I feel great.  After high intensity I feel fine but my skin is sore and my back muscles will be sore the next day because my ARC space is somewhat steep.  The times you mention for ARC training seem rather short and the last protocol of X min seems more like a PE repeater workout.  I can describe what I do for ARC in contrast simply as climbing at the highest intensity that I feel I can sustain for  uninterrupted minutes or beyond.       I dont normally train ARC exclusively these days but last summer I was doing  to  minutes of ARCin usually in  large time blocks.   Another way I would think about intensity is in terms of hand moves what is the intensity range where you are able to make  hand moves?  Across the long time horizon many training seasons you want to be slowly ramping up that intensity as your strength power skill etc extend you capacity.  But for now I would look to find a level that works for  moves or more. What is your normal climbing volume for a day at the crag?  I find it a little surprising that  total min of ARC could leave you super tired unless you were not normally climbing many pitches per day.  Perhaps you need to up your general climbing fitness so that the ARC training will fall more inside of the volume you expect to enjoy at the crag.,climbharder,d1piljo,2,t5_2s5er

7307068,0,t1_d28czur,Fair question! I havent done bench presses in a few years so I figured Id try and cautiously reintroduce them.

7394095,0,t3_4gljtw,The issue is that grades are based on whoever set the problem. You often hear of some routes that are set more for their style of climbing so they can do a pinchy V but fall on a V that requires more balance. You also have the issue of the difference in grades between not only setters but gyms vs other gyms and outdoors. Or how you can have a  year old that climbs Vs. Its all proportional strength.There arent absolutes like with the plate progression for powerlifting.,climbharder,d2inrcc,-1,t5_2s5er
7415478,0,t3_4gv89d,This post reads really weird. Are you asking what such a sticky would include? Which two posts ... both specific posts are you talking about precisely?Theres a ton of posts that are constantly returning but being a mod Im sure you can identify those. Other than that I think Id love to see some of peoples training plans outline of their week as well as each of the training days and a little info of what they climb and what their body is like.To provide context of that last bit Im a yo male weigh in at about kg Ive been cutting weight and cm. Thats ft and lbs in case you feel like shouting MURICA right now. I have no idea about bodyfat actually ordered a fat crease measurement thing today but Ill go ahead and guess its about .A lot of the things I read dont provide much context on who they are for or they simply focus on people that are athletes not necessarily professionally and not just your average guy at the bouldering gym like me. That means that a lot of the exercises and plans are simply far too advanced for me and the advice far less useful at this point in time.Cheers!P.S. Thanks Milyoo for all your good posts. I keep an eye out whenever you say something on here I feel like the stuff you say doesnt only focus on efficiency but also on maintaining your body instead of ruining it at  years old.

7636691,0,t3_4jwciy,I havent used a Bam board but I would assume that youd just use the angle as a method for progression.  Kind of the same way youd use edge size on a Transgression board.  Basically hang an edge at a specific depth and angle and progressively add weight.  Once you reach some specified weight make the hold worse by changing the depth or angle.FWIW I would assume the real benefit of the Bam board is the ability to train on a project hold a grip thats very similar to a crux hold on something you want to climb.,climbharder,d3a8z4r,2,t5_2s5er

I dont necessarily use it as a preworkout I just mix up one drink a day usually late in the afternoon when I used to make a trip to the office candy drawer because it makes me not hungry.Anyway in the past couple weeks I sent a couple longterm projects that were particularly power endurance oriented routes where Id typically pump out near the end.

8964279,0,t1_d7paect,Interesting. Ive stayed away from using weight on the woody because  most of my projects are still unsent even after months  our woody is adjustable angle so I use that for progressive overload and  most of my woody problems are on pretty shite holds that often involve full crimping and to add weight seems like a way to invite injury. To clarify I dont do long roof sequences usually  moves focusing on raw power or tension. I do it mostly because it doesnt feel dangerous and Ive usually exhausted all the roof sets and obvious eliminatesrainbow problems after its been up for a while but like having a session or so a week on that wall so adding weight is an easy way to make it fresh again. Again unsure if it helps and its hard for me to evaluate since roof climbing suits me and I can usually do everything thats set but its also not a thing I put very much timeenergy into for that reason.,climbharder,d7pddq8,1,t5_2s5er

9054688,0,t3_54akgr,My advice would be to avoid removing weight and never add much more than half your weight to a hang. With that in mind you want a hold depth that allows you to sustain an open hand crimp for multiple sets of s. A good idea is to start with a campus rung  cm depth. When that gets too easy you can tape cardboard above the rung to reduce the depth.Edit in response to your first question there have been studies that show that its almost always better to add weight than to use smaller holds. For more information you should check out the Steve Maisch interview on the training beta podcast.,climbharder,d808917,3,t5_2s5er

9129899,0,t3_55adst,The answer to your specific question is probably yes. You cant climb at maximum strength for extended periods of time because your keratin phosphate cycle doesnt have the capacity to sustain hard movement.

10594353,0,t1_dd8ofcb,They always feel tweaky and just flat out strange to me. A pure open hang for me is only  id have to add the pinky during a F OC and then roll up into full. Awkward. You would need to use the entire ROM to get the best benefit for hypertrophy. Youd have to really dial in the movement to prevent getting the shoulders involved. Other than that no I cant see why not. Everything works when performed correctly. I still think forearm hypertrophy is going to be best done in a pure strength phase where you do deadlift bench and lots of volume for every muscle in the forearms. For hypertrophy youre probably better off doing bar rolls with a barbell than hanging finger rolls. Heavy bar roll eccentrics would be more effective for hypertrophy than finger rolls I think. Just because the exercise appears to mimic climbing doesnt mean its the most effective to reach whatever your goal is. Not saying you believe this just reinforcing the principleAlso during climbing when you need to bump into a crimp from an open grip the motion is almost entirely driven by the hips. You essentially perform the last little moments of the original movement again to further extend your reach and wrap the crimp over. Its a highly skilled movement and I dont think finger rolls would really provide a significant benefit since during the roll you move exclusively the fingers. One would also encounter more wrist flexion during said movement than a hanging roll. This was not your question but Im just writing now. Also if you can just ninja grab every hold the way you need to the first time as if you were the most bad ass dude there ever was... youd be a bloc slayer ,climbharder,dd8q4sg,1,t5_2s5er

10802394,0,t1_ddtzw83,With regard to bouldering specifically I think people way overplay the importance of technique in general not in this subreddit. I personally think strength is what gets you  of the way there and technique gives you that final  with quickly diminishing returns that can often be overcome by a bit of additional strength.Even with technique often the reason you see people flailing around with bad form is because they have body strength issues.Dont get me wrong if your technique is horrendous youre not going to send anything but IMO its pretty easy to become proficient in a year or two of climbing whereas with strength you have no choice but to sink many years into if you want to become any good and its not something you can neglect and quickly pick back up later like you can with technique.Just my opinion though. Maybe Im missing out on something huge.,climbharder,ddu6vey,2,t5_2s5er
10826038,0,t1_ddu3ccr,I totally agree with this. Its just like a beginner trying to copy an experienced climbers beta on a project route for them it doesnt work. In my opinion the ability to most efficiently use technique on hard relative difficulty moves is determined mainly by how strong your fingers are and your flexibility.,climbharder,ddwmo6q,1,t5_2s5er

11021106,0,t1_deh535g,The original thought was to increase my base endurance level which is really bad but keep my power and strength high so I can pull really hard moves. I plan on shifting from a ARC focus to a PE focus throughout my cycle but keep a constant max hang cycle. The max hangs are high intensity and high frequency but low volume only  sets of  grips right now doing  hangs total.I honestly dont have a ton of literature to support my program but Im willing to sacrifice my body to science to see how it turns out. I know that is isnt a standard approach but this program should make me improve my personal weaknesses and help me to build a good base level of fitness.,climbharder,deh7n71,1,t5_2s5er
11024361,0,t1_deght89,I agree that as the program stands it is mostly strength and power but I feel as though that is where I need to improve in order to meet my goal of bouldering higher grades. Also I am under the impression that anaerobic capacity is something that can be improved in an on demand way so if I feel as though I need more strengthpower endurance I could adjust my program then and gain it relatively quickly. I agree with you that the campuslimithangboard block may be too strenuous my hope is that since I will be doing repeaters instead of max hangs during that block I will be able to manage it but we will see.,climbharder,dehkxzb,2,t5_2s5er
11056234,0,t3_5xt7z1,The local gym since its opening has reverted to setting big gymnastic moves using massive slopers and pinches with no feet. I watched two setters argue about the dangerous height of the finishing hold only for the setter to say if they dont get it they dont want it enough. The hold was at  feet you dyno to it using two pinches. Yeah I dont think Im going to renew this year.,climbharder,del7ex1,2,t5_2s5er

11175468,0,t1_deylbl8,I think getting climbing mileage is more important than training for beginners. Often beginners will get too focused on trying to train in any way possible and lose sight of climbing itself. They do things that arent very sport specific. Stuff like bodyweight ab exercises because they need a stronger core. Also training can take time away from climbing whether youre replacing climbing with training or whether youre recovering from training so you cant climb. In addition beginners who feel that their finger strength is lacking might try to hangboard or use those grip strength trainers I think thats the real underlying message when people say just climb.  Although I agree that just climbing should be somewhat structured to ensure progression. Most important thing is probably to try harder stuff. If you see things that they could do better when climbing point it out avoiding spray of course.,climbharder,deyq6b4,3,t5_2s5er

11458351,0,t3_61xmeg,Sorry for the slow reply I wasnt ignoring this just busy.I know this doesnt make sense and my only real evidence is anecdotal. I guess there are several factors happening.  Yes I bet my calorie intake does increase and lead to some weight gain but not to a huge degree.  Ive read a little into muscle memory and this could have some function? Also my legs are so untrained yet large the added glycogen probably adds a couple of KG!As Ive always had strong legs I find odd when people want to train them for climbing completely forgetting that other have enviably small albeit weak sticks ,climbharder,dfuso8s,1,t5_2s5er
11471311,0,t1_dfvhd1u,gt I cant remember who said it but someone did a study that showed people breaking into the french a grade were actually as strong or stronger than people climbing a or b. Basically the number itself was limiting those climbers mentally from fully using their strength and being able to perform on the wall.I am pretty sure that was from the lattice guys probably from the AMA they did.edit There you go    the question was about people who climb harder that what their strength suggest.,climbharder,dfw9n93,2,t5_2s5er
11508483,0,t3_6499xr,Absolutely being hydrated is important. Eating before but not too much is also important and eating food to recover after is important.

11646562,0,t1_dgg42e6,If youre bouldering for three hours each time definitely not. But its fine if you keep the sessions short. E.g. my schedule  TuTh Max Hangs Bouldering  SaSu BoulderingThe TuTh sessions are shorter and usually a bit easier than the weekend sessions but Im still climbing V in them  hard enough to keep skills sharp but not so hard that I get tweaky. IME those sessions are great for keeping my skills sharp and rehearsing problems while still allowing enough recovery time for the important weekend sessions. ,climbharder,dgg5gw5,1,t5_2s5er
