2550560,0,t3_2mmxq2,Allinclusives in Belize work a little differently then say Mexico and are not that popular. However depending on your budget I would recommend Azul Resort on Ambergris Caye. Pricey but you get your own private villa with planned meals tours etc.Otherwise a couple of hotels here offer an allinclusive package that covers drinks and food you may want to do a search online to explore those options.,Belize,cmrhuov,1,t5_2sgvs
3342989,0,t1_cp9bodn,No problem! Try to spend some time in the interior it was my favorite part of the trip. Go cave exploring cliff diving and shopping in the open air markets! ,Belize,cp9bqaz,1,t5_2sgvs
5548290,0,t3_3r11se,Dont stay in an Air BnB. I recommend staying at Maya Beach Hotelwww.mayabeachhotel.com in Placencia. They will help work everything out for you and help you plan activities that will fit your budget while you are there. Marlon is great at finding awesome day trips.The restaurant there is the best in the area seriously get the peanut brittle ice cream pie. They provide free kayaks that you can check out and paddle to the uninhabited island about a mile off shore. It is just a great place and is highly recommended.,Belize,cwktepd,1,t5_2sgvs

7979044,0,t3_4oehn8,  the law is designed to protect local jobs. common trades cannot get work there because there are plenty of locals to do them.  workers in belize average . a day. it is rare that the type people needed in belize want to expat there.  effectively you cannot get a job there...legally.,Belize,d4cx49r,0,t5_2sgvs
