Ive personally stayed at Nireeda Apartments as I was visiting Geelong for an extended time and they were quite good although at the time and this was  years ago they had no Internet access.  Hopefully other people have some more options for you!Edit I have heard the Mercure is nice but overpriced.,Geelong,cgm2cf3,5,t5_2s98u

11010619,0,t3_5w2l2e,Ocean Grove seems nice and quiet but too far away from Geelong for my liking Geelong has plenty of shitty people but the majority are good i have found.Unless you gravitate toward shitty people!,Geelong,deg0u6q,1,t5_2s98u
