1700222,0,t1_cjtergp,This update was awesome and as a thank you for this awesome update here are some additional bug reports D. In app colours revert to the new default colour but the statusnavbar remembers them just fine. This is triggered when minimizing the app and then relaunching it. But force closing it and reopening it remembers the colours just fine.  Image  | Image . One of the last colour schemes is either duplicated or forgets to clear the check after choosing the next colour. This problem occurs ONLY in the last colour group.  Image I love the new update this is quickly pulling me away from another beautiful sms apps hellosmsEDIT So glad you made it change colours without having to restart that wouldve taken forever to test them all otherwise ,QKSMS,cjth4rp,2,t5_32png
