3771322,0,t1_cqm5kc2,I forgot about Fates elemental brothers so yea youre right about that.  I agree that Negi is a BAMF with a constant power level in UQ but Im saying that from when Negima! ends to when he gets sealed theres no freaking way he didnt level up a few times.,UQHolder,cqm5pjh,1,t5_2zs27
4022031,0,t1_creqbkt,Without a doubt but Akamatsu has also been teasing more things and not answering many questions from Negima.  Im just being impatient ,UQHolder,creqpz4,4,t5_2zs27

4630953,0,t1_cteag97,Yeah at first I didnt realize how old Holders origins were but back when Karin was fighting creepy shadow guy he dated her story to about  AD   years ago. And she was rescued by another immortal that the art on the page implies is Evangeline. And shes number .And while I dont know if shell be there when he does I think its safe to say Touta will get there in four days. Kiries with him after all. If she cooperates he has as much training time as he needs to make it.,UQHolder,cteavw4,2,t5_2zs27

5159144,0,t1_cv7v7gf,Yeah but who made him ? If he was made by Konoka herself then she really needs to appear in this series even better if shes an immortal LOLIt feels strange since Konoka really never have any direct reason to fight the Lifemaker aside from her father being in Ala Rubra,UQHolder,cv7vaaj,1,t5_2zs27

6759961,0,t1_d0hzld5,That could be. In Negima it was revealed he was the only thing keeping the magical world intact which is why he was sealed and why the world was crumbling at the threat of the MotB waking up if I recall right. Thats where Negis plan to save the world came from in terms of terraforming mars though by doing so he was removing the necessity for the MotB to exist. What that means as far as his necessity to magic in someway im not sure I think well get more on that when Touta encounters Negi for the first time.,UQHolder,d0ijbrz,2,t5_2zs27

7301281,0,t1_d28306q,gt Though really that only makes it more confusing as to what theory of time Akamatsu is going with. Yeah its confusing in Negima too. Consider that Negi had already time traveled for his short jumps using Cassiopeia during the festival  Negi was approached by a number of people regarding things he hadnt done yet  and then later using the same time machine he leaves the timeline where Chao reveals magic and changes the past.I ramble about that in the reread thread which is at that part of the series.,UQHolder,d283tvz,1,t5_2zs27
7994141,0,t3_4onafu,At least its getting good home in BSM alongside Heroic Legend of Arslan and Attack on Titan.Im excited for the anime.Edit Im going to miss the weekly discussion threads with everyone but theyre not going to stop just be less frequent.Also well have a weekly anime to look discuss in the near futureearly ?,UQHolder,d4em8jk,2,t5_2zs27
9321104,0,t1_d8w92en,I dont think were going to get Shaft on this because theyre mostly on the Monogatari train and after the OADsmovie I think I recall hearing they were done working with Akamatsu. Ideally Id want to see David Production on it since they have experience with long running series Jojo and have done at least one other franchise in anime form Neptunia.,UQHolder,d8xioae,1,t5_2zs27
