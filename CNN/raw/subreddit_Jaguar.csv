2381981,0,t1_cm5ojtm,Pensacola FL.  I have a  min commute of most all hwy.  The car and the water view makes me not hate it.  I cant stress enough to spend some time on the jaguarforum.   There is tons of good info.  As far as typical issues these are what pop up  Replace the battery as Low voltage drives  of electrical gremlins  Thermostat housing fails in the xk around k which can cause overheating  Its a relatively easy fix.  Theres an ac drain issue that if you dotn use it regularly the drainline can clog and it can dump drain water in passenger floorboard.  There is an easy DIY fix on the forum.  As i live in FL I use AC all year and have never seen any issues.  Otherwise there are no real mechanical issues to speak of that I see people reporting.  Many drivers on the forums have put near k with just regular maintenance.  Find a good jaguar mech to do any work unless you like that kind of thing yourself.  Its really a fantastic car and about the best bangbuck youll find on an eye catching not too common GT.,Jaguar,cm64d2r,1,t5_2qr47
3348000,0,t3_2yiafe,The keys arent that expensive themselves its the remote part for the switchblade thats not too cheap but a straight regular key?   IIRC.Problem is the car has to get schlepped to the dealer to get the key programmed I do believe..... ,Jaguar,cp9wblb,2,t5_2qr47
4212291,0,t1_cs02qbr,Yeah I got that link when I googled it as well. Trouble is sensor cover isnt very specific. The XF cabin is littered with sensors  Looks like a part that might be out of main sight as it looks quite utilitarian. FWIW I put that part number into a Jaguar spares site without any luck.,Jaguar,cs0dy9z,1,t5_2qr47

4599830,0,t1_ctadn3x,Good.  I had problems with the trunk divider.  Jag fixed it.  I had a leak from the rear suspension Jag fixed it.  I had a problem with the driver side door rubbing the frame Jag fixed it.,Jaguar,ctaec05,2,t5_2qr47
4683069,0,t1_ctkkg46,They are land rover and this is an aluminium evoque. which itself is a hideous car driven by twats. definitely devalues the brand,Jaguar,ctkuhzi,1,t5_2qr47
4908447,0,t3_3fu6s1,My dad used to run the same set of  OEM rims with Vredestein snow tires on both his  XF .D and  XF .DS Sportbrake when he had those cars. Very limited problems even in fairly bad snow and ice. Especially the later cars with the speed transmission have very good traction control that works wonders in winter conditions. As for any under body coating Id go for a light wax coating if you intend to keep the car for many years to come. If youll just have it for a few years dont bother. The rust proofing on these cars is very good but its always better to be on the safe side if your car is a keeper.,Jaguar,cud8vzd,1,t5_2qr47
5013908,0,t3_3jlncz,I am also an Evoque driver and love the look of the FPace.  When were in the market for a second car itll all depend on the space in it  the Evoque is a little small for stuff like camping with a family.  ,Jaguar,cuqd5sn,2,t5_2qr47
5643887,0,t1_cwwgw6e,I will ask the dealer how exactly they would fit the pedals whether theirs would go on top of existing ones or if they take the factory fitted ones off.,Jaguar,cwwofzm,1,t5_2qr47

7745879,0,t3_4kbwd5,I would suggest the dealer or googling for mechanics that specialize in European cars. I have never had issues with getting my Xtype repaired but it is mostly a ford so I am not surprised. Mechanics are a fickle bunch. No real way to tell the good ones from the bad except experience. Google reviews are a distant second to experience. ,Jaguar,d3mnf2f,2,t5_2qr47
7758957,0,t3_4lho93,The hp SCV is the one to have. The diesel is underpowered. and once you option up a regular R sporr the different between that and a S is about k anyways. ,Jaguar,d3o4twe,1,t5_2qr47
7759801,0,t3_4l7mg8,Should be a pretty standard job. I have an xjs so Im not sure if there are things to look out for on the XJ. There have to be a few replaceable parts that are worth doing when you have it torn down that far.Probably at least do a quick valve job and replace the valve stem seals while you are there and it is always good to clean carbon off the head and piston surface.Check cam wear while you are there to see if you need to adjust the valves.Ive had really good luck with super  degreaser which is similar to simple green and purple power but doesnt seem to leave the matte finish that those do. If you can get some it may be worth a dip to clean the head off. Last time i had a head decked they cleaned the head and I did a better job at home letting it soak in a tub of cleaner.If you change the oil pretty regularly it may not be necessary though. I just like cleaning everything up. Its nice to take down an engine with k and make the top end look brand new save for the wear. ,Jaguar,d3o89vf,1,t5_2qr47

8437023,0,t3_4v7gcm,I drive my XKR mostly year round.  of snow renders it inopperable even with traction control. Rear wheel drive and hp and summer tires do not play nicely for the white stuff.That being said you could get a v awd and put better tires on it and it should be much better. THe supercharged v does not come with awd option for the ftype.Its incredibly comfortable and civilized and a whole lot of fun when you really get on it. Do NOT use a commercial car wash that you drive through. You can however use the drive in type where you get a hose and brush. If memory serves though the first year or so you are supposed to use special cleaning instructions though.,Jaguar,d5w61b6,3,t5_2qr47
9070050,0,t3_54eu2r,For that price it would need to be absolutely perfect with full maintenance records. Even with k its a  year old car and that seems expensive to me at least. I bought mine two months ago with k for . By all means buy an XJR but I think you should be able to find a better deal.,Jaguar,d822n8k,1,t5_2qr47

9783389,0,t3_5fboq5,I think you might be best off contacting Jaguar PR about your project.    That said I bought my  XJR because it was the best Jaguar I could find in my price range. I cant put my finger on the exact reason but Ive wanted a Jag for a decade and finally decided to get one. Im a  year old white guy. Had two BMWs prior and wanted something more refined.,Jaguar,daj0lcf,1,t5_2qr47

11250995,0,t1_df79r4m,So strange. Even the XF is older than the FType. Unless theyre talking about oldest without a refresh? Either way the XJ is the oldest. ,Jaguar,df7a867,1,t5_2qr47
11376496,0,t3_615i5n,It depends on what you are looking for.F Pace  Great driving and handling with good space.      Disco    Great amount of space the Land Rover off road capability.     Velar     Read somewhere that it is based on the same platform as the F Pace and release pics showed a great interior. ,Jaguar,dfli8hl,1,t5_2qr47
