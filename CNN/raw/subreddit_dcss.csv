375657,0,t1_cfjp6le,I am not aware of such an amulet. Are you sure youre not thinking of potions of beneficial mutation? Or maybe amulets of resist mutation which O think are mainly for fighting enemies that try to mutate you I dont know if they work against potions?I think regular potions of mutation are always a very big gamble. Potions of benificial mutation are still a bit of a gamble as some good mutations still have drawbacks but its a much safer gamble.Also in general Crawl is specifically designed to try to avoid those hoarding situations where a bad item is worth holding onto in case some special case happens so if am item seems bad its often more likely that it is and isnt worth storing.Some things are still worth holding onto though.  Scrolls of enchant weapon or enchant armor for example.  In these cases one thing you can do is stash them in either the Temple or Lair .  Temple never spawns any enemies and Lair  spawns only beasts so theres no risk of your items getting picked up by orcs or eaten by jellies or whatever.  Stashing strategic scrolls and potions like cure mutation or enchant weapon is a good idea because it stops them from getting destroyed.  You can also stash things like books or spare permafood or wands to save inventory space.  Youll waste some time and food running to your stash and back burn you get more inventory space for tactical items and dont have to worry about ice damage shattering your cure mutation potions.,dcss,cfjpabv,2,t5_2s7d8

1239121,0,t1_ci8qypb,My usual trick is to stand on the down stairs evoke or cast cTele read teleport climb down read mapping and then teleport to any one of the eight hallways on the outside edge around the middle of the hallway. If I dont have cTele it depends on my character and I occasionally try a different rune instead. Note evoking cTele using the ring doesnt require training evocations since you can sit on the staircase and try until it works. Having a huge fail doesnt really matter. Without cTele Im not sure how an archer deals with it so I should probably leave that question to someone else but I imagine hasting and retreating along one of the four hallways out from the centre is an option. Definitely get a second opinion on this though like I said I dont really play archers. ,dcss,ci90mws,1,t5_2s7d8

1934975,0,t3_2gte3y,Neither one is really any good for your particular situation but that said speed is pretty much straight up better but there is a caveat. I tend to try to keep a draining weapon around for when I am facing an overwhelming enemy as every strike reduces the HD of the enemy allowing you to defeat things that otherwise would wipe the floor with you.  The bad news is it also decreases the exp that you gain from the kill so its best to only use draining weapons in dire circumstances if at all.Speed on the other hand is arguably one of the best brands in the game but the fact of the matter is as an enchanter you really want to be stabbing most enemies killing them out right in a single blow so speed wont be of much use.Not to mention you really want a quick blade that would be almost as fast as your dagger of speed anyway.  The brand that would likely serve you best is electrocution. ,dcss,ckmcna0,1,t5_2s7d8

2132559,0,t3_2je34l,Youve spread yourself a bit thin on skills early with the training in slings poison and air especially with Grs terrible aptitudes in poison and air all skill that are somewhat redundant with earth magic and conjurations but theyre all useful early so its not unreasonable.Finding an early staff of earth is great.  Thats a good enough weapon to last you all game with some evocations and earth magic training.  Its also worth training staves to  at some point for mindelay.Aside from that the main glaring flaw in your skill training is the complete lack of any fighting training.  The extra HP you get from that would be nice.  More dodging would be good too.  I actually might prioritize those over stavesevocations but it really depends on whether youre having more trouble killing things or taking too much damage.  Youre a Gr so you can afford to have a bit less defensive skill investment than most.Overall I think this characters looking solid.  As for where to go Id just keep going with Lair.  If youre worried about hydras and death yaks maybe save the last couple floors for later.  After lair do orc as usual.  Lees Rapid Deconstruction can be great in orc for clearing large numbers of enemies you just have to lure them to walls if they start in the open.  Bolt of draining is also nice but with no necromancy training you wont have a ton of spell power with it and I dont think Id recommend necromancy yet with this character.,dcss,claw8ha,1,t5_2s7d8

2259461,0,t3_2l32nq,Hi. generel impression  Impressive set of mutations but you know you were lucky right? You overtrained hexes  unless you have mass confusiondiscord  is enough. You have no invisibilty which would be really really good. You have bad defenses I recommend training a lot of dodging. First Swamp is easy for an enchanter most dangerous are thorn hunters and mangroves everything else is susceptible to hexes. Same for spider if you find invisibilty you have two runes both rune vaults have almost no enemies that have sInv.  Do orc next you should be able to do it easily and hope for invis! Then most people go down the dungeon to D.  Then two lair branches you just EH confuseDazzle everything and stab it. Painbrand wait until orc but no longer you will need the spike in damage afterwards and QBs are really rare your best bet is ?ACQ if you trained SB to at least  but even then it might gave rapiers or artifact QBs... Id probably enchant a rapier but then you need to switch to a dagger to stab highHP uniques. saint rokka nikola etc. While at it learn passwall its AMAZING for setting up stabs esp in spiderdungeonZot later on. As soon as your defenses are up dodging  at least  if you can make it since you have air manual and book of clouds thats a good backup spell. I like Vaults  as stealth char all the doors and nooks and crannies are easy to abuse if something goes wrong you pop freezing cloud and done. Good luck!,dcss,clqznzk,2,t5_2s7d8

2318631,0,t1_clyajb1,Out of your better than vorpal brands all but flaming freezing and electrocution are pretty conditional.  One top of the conditions you listed vampiric and pain useless in extended holy useless outside of extended distortion only on specific characters theres also the fact that pain is only useful if you have necromancy training and antimagic is only useful if youre not dependent on your mana.I would put freezing flaming electrocution and vorpal as the big general purpose brands.  Vorpal is the weakest of them but its still nice.Although draining isnt also necessarily weaker than vorpal against nonimmune enemies ever since the rework.  On a big slow weapon vorpals usually better but on a faster weapon draining can do comparable damage while also providing a nice defensive bonus against enemies not immune to it.gtand yeah freezing is probably better than flaming especially in extended. but maybe a little bit before too because of lair draconians OOF occasional summoned demons despite counterpoint of liches. but to tell the truth I dont usually think of extended because I dont usually play itI think freezing is much better than flaming in Lair Zot and maybe Snake it varies by branch in extended flaming for Tomb Coc and I guess kind of Slime Freezing for Geh not sure about the rest but could probably go either way and theyre roughly equivalent everywhere else.,dcss,clyapi9,1,t5_2s7d8

4416288,0,t3_3bgtnc,To add my  cent. Ive got around  wins on Crawl so far Would have had a th but I died on the run out... fucking teleport trap....Two were with MampF One was with Long Swords.Not only basing my judgment on that but the many games Ive started and died from Long Swords seem to have a better early game progression but you can hit a wall if you get unlucky whereas MampFs progression is alllllllright.... But Demon Whips are plentiful.The only big difference I feel between the two is that Usually if youre going MampF you get a shield whereas Long Swords youre gonna want a Triple Sword or bust so a Shield goes out the window unless youre a Formicid and the lack of a shield later in the game is something I do notice although if youre worshiping Makhleb you probably wont.The only problem I have with Long Blades is how sparse they are in comparison to Demon Whips the game is random but if Im running a Long Blades character I feel compelled to pick TrogOka because Ill never reach a Triple Sword without them compare that to a Demon Whip where youre basically guaranteed to find one by the end of the Vault Basically Ive only had  run so far where Ive gotten to the end of V and not replaced my Whip of Electrocution so if you play the numbers game MampF are statistically a safer option.,dcss,csng7ht,2,t5_2s7d8

Id say train UC Fighting and Dodge right now. When you get the armor you want turn your armor on and take off Dodge. And consider the shields option. You only need  skill for a large shield.

If I start using this randart I cant brand it anyway though and Id have to burn up a lot of enchant weapon scrolls to get an equally good mundane h polearm that I can pain brand dont you think?

I know that saving them all for the DT wont do me any good if I die on the way to picking it up but I just have a hard time justifying blowing all that on a weapon that I dont even really want.Also why is Necronomicon usually a bad choice?

8510996,0,t1_d65dhec,gt Still my highest score in my Hall of Fame was with a Formicid Fighter of CheiActually according to some speedrun players chei is one of the best god to do speedruns and consequently get highscore. This because especially early on his stats bonus makes the char much stronger respect the average powercurse    e.g. better spell success and power higher ACEV  so he makes easier to skip a big part of the early|mid game being still strong enough to get runes and maybe some equip from the last floors vaults  this is also important because most of the turn counts of a speed run comes from that first part of the game.Obliviously those considerations dont apply at at all in a normal game where the aim is to win while playing safely. Chei significantly decreases your chances to do so for the hardest part of the game because when things fails he leaves you dead and even later he isnt really better of good strong gods for a normal build char,dcss,d65fivy,1,t5_2s7d8

Humans are vanilla  some races have advantages that make them easier in some ways and certain combos take advantage of these differences. Minotaur are combat focused and can be considered easy. Deep Elves are magic focused and can be considered relatively easy for magic focused builds. Then throw in choosing which god to worship into the mix. Fighters are easier to start with than Casters but most builds will eventually hybridize to varying degrees.GrFiOka makes the early game easier and makes certain branches much easier. The extra AC and GDR pretty good combat stats except dodge and rPois all contribute to survivability whereas lower HP means you have to play more carefully.The other common learn to crawl combos are MiBeTrogbydefault MiFiOka DECjVeh HOFiGlOkaMak...

While the shitty stats make dying to Adders a very real possibility once I got into the mid game and was slinging cards with a mindelay polearm and picked up a couple utility spells it was fun. I think that Cynos might be well served by getting extra Spell Levels from level ups to compensate for the  they lose out on from spellcasting skill.

10717954,0,t1_ddlg6d2,...I honestly dont understand the argument youre making.  The orb run is a nonfactor so making it less of a factor will somehow discourage people from getting more runes?  Theres already people who go for  runes despite no advantage to it now why would that change?  I also dont feel that Im making things easier the further you go.  The end of the game is the Orb.  You reach the Orb well before you explore the entire game.  Anything you do after reaching the Orb is extra stuff you dont need to do.  I would compare it to a Metroidvaniastyle game.  After you reach a certain point well before youve done everything you can go after the final boss and win.  If you go and get everything its not required but you have a much easier time because youre more powerful because you have better stuff.  Its not a perfect analogy but thats what my idea is going for  you  the game you have an easier time with the end than if you go for say .  That said I get what you two are saying. I just dont think its a good idea to make the win condition harder with more runes.  If you want to challenge yourself runes is already a significant one as it is and on top of that Zigs exist.  The game already has optional scaling challenges for those interested.  ,dcss,ddlh783,1,t5_2s7d8

With Kobolds lowerthanaverage maximum HP the prospect of coping with that onslaught while wielding a short blade is pretty grim.    Wrath often triggers right after a tough fight when you are at less than max HP too.If you insist on eventually trying Uskayaw with this character I first suggest letting Trog carry you through collecting  runes and probably Zot .   Maybe Abyss for rune  and then you could use Abyss as a grindytedious place to burn off Trog wrath .... blink away when Trog mobs you then run and teleport away.Dont expect that wrath burnoff period to be any fun though.

Once dodging catches up Id probably focus somewhat evenly on dodgingarmorfighting to increase your overall survivability.  You could consider a ranged skill or just keep using evocations for your ranged option.,dcss,defy77b,3,t5_2s7d8

11341169,0,t3_61udt2,First try all the already mentioned very standard Minotaurgargoyletroll fighterberserkers.Centaur hunter with bows are incredibly easy to due their ability to run away from things as needed although youll have to manage both melee and ranged weaponry early on due to ammo limitations.If you want something a bit less conventional but still extremely powerful vine stalkers are absolutely one of the best races in the game. They have very rapid healing and bites to restore mana which doubles as hp.  Does take a bit of experimentation to get used to the shared hpmana though.  The  hp sounds scary but really their mana makes up for it.,dcss,dfhi2po,2,t5_2s7d8

11524663,0,t3_64gy5n,Xom is not all that hard. The most important part is having strategies to evade his fuckery in the early game when youre most vulnerable. To this end I like to play strong races or races with some innate escape ability like Centaur or Spriggan with their speed. Centaur is my preferred option because theyre beefier and wont be obliterated by a single act of Xom. Spriggan also have a nice advantage with their hexes aptitude Xom likes when confused enemies do stuff.Kiting with faster races can also give Xom more chances to act favourably in high tension situations or let you run away completely if his acts are not favourable.On top of that you want to ID your consumables early on so that youll have access to tele and blink at any time he happens to spawn a bunch of demons on top of you or berserk an elephant.Make sure you use your Chaos weapon while starting out because using random effects is one of the few ways you have to improve Xoms amusement level not the same as his mood and this gives you a bit more buffer against the RNG through the early game. Wear faith amulets if you find them early on to enhance the general Xomminess of the run and also to rack up your positive mutations as early as possible.Remember to say thankyou whenever he gifts you a choko.,dcss,dg2bmfz,2,t5_2s7d8
