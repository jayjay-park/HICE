1302908,0,t3_28xte0,This article is a joke. The premise that jobs are unreliable translates into Hadoop being unreliable is utter BS. By far the biggest problem with Hadoop projects failing is that the developers using it arent using it properly. ,hadoop,cig6z8z,2,t5_2r1e2

3973917,0,t1_cr97vd4,Totally agreed. Small sample size as well.Look at the  YoY growth with respect to every Hadoop platform vendor and youll recognize that healthy demand is there. That doesnt mean that data warehouses are being tossed out the window en masse though.,hadoop,cr99d5i,3,t5_2r1e2

6710247,0,t1_d0cqn5w,Cloudera emp speakingIn our most recent round of benchmarking based on a TPCDSderived workload Presto had to be removed from the comparative set because most  of the queries would not run e.g. due to need for DECIMAL support which Presto does not yet have.We did not include Drill in this testing because frankly we see very little of it in production deployments.,hadoop,d0deaz2,3,t5_2r1e2
6714120,0,t1_d0deaz2,gt ecause most  of the queries would not run e.g. due to need for DECIMAL support which Presto does not yet have.gt We did not include Drill in this testing because frankly we see very little of it in production deployments.Agreed on the DECIMAL support. Luckily they are almost there with the teradata DECIMAL support PR. I hope we get to see more Drill in production in the future they have some interesting ideas in that project namely the federated query support which is a killer concept.Thanks for your work on Impala its great.,hadoop,d0dsq3i,1,t5_2r1e2
7039182,0,t1_d1e1z60,Parquet and ORC file formats were used. In some cases certain software optimizes for one over the other. Im sure you can guess who does what.Our performance engineer always roots for the underdog so while he works tirelessly to optimize the different engines if one is clearly in the lead hell go to great lengths to see what can be done to knock it off the top spot including in some cases optimizing the code and contributing it back. As a preview for the next round Spark . is looking like theyve made some nice performance gains.Both Cloudera and Hortonworks are great companies doing their best to define the future of Hadoop. Wed like to think were Switzerland in the big data wars and this benchmark process has shown that there isnt just one winner each engine can provide the best results in different vectors of evaluation speed scale concurrency latency etc.,hadoop,d1e8xi4,1,t5_2r1e2
