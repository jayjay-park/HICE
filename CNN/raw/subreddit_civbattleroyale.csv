On my laptop it looked very nice so no complaints.I hate to be that guy however the North sea is not the sea beween Sweden Finland and Poland as described in the ranking of Sweden.

5038591,0,t3_3jyk3f,Hey there guys! As was previously discussed in this thread Ive decided to make a Patreon so that users that wish to contribute ultimately can! Currently I have no decent rewards that I can think of but just as something to do initially anyone who does become a patron can have their name highlighted in Orangetheir chosen flair civ colour so that everyone knows how awesome they are. Also Im thinking that when Spies come into play whoever the top contributors are will get to choose where the Spies go.In terms of additional content Im happy to make way more artwork maps infodumps podcasts review videos or anything that is requested andor wanted! If there is anything that you guys want to see in particular  Im more than happy to listen. Just let me know if there is anything I can do for you guys!Regarding what the Patreon platform actually is  Patreon is much like a Kickstarter campaign except instead of an initial flat contribution users Patrons provide an amount of money that is given to the content creator either every month or for every piece of content they produce I fall in the former category not the latter.EDIT Also thanks to uAquaticSasquatch Ive made some adjustments to the subreddit theme featuring the leaders of the  Civ BR!,civbattleroyale,cutcauz,32,t5_36z7e

Therefore in order for the Kimberley the real contenders to make headway they need to have another civilization eat up the forces.There are two routes I can see this happeningROUTE  . Australia and the Kimberley team up on Indonesia Gajah Mada is entirely wiped but Jandamarra snipes at least  of cities.. Australia gets in an offensive war against the Maori Kimberley defend and take remaining Indonesia with their navy and immediately send the armies east.. Australian navy ends up in a tangle and spread out between the Kimberley and the Maori and since Indonesia is one hell of a deathtrap for ships theyll be at least at  strength.. Kimberley attack by land from the rear and capture at least Sunshine Coast and entirely obliterate the Australian army.ROUTE . As many Oceanic civilizations team up on them as possible. In order of importance that is Kimberley Maori Indonesia Japan Vietnam Champa Hawaii. Put together they probably have just enough navy to defeat the Australians with absolutely DEVASTATING losses on the antiAussie side. From there Kimberley land forces and a bulwark will easily split the Aussies in half.,civbattleroyale,cw4mg4s,15,t5_36z7e

The Maya now are landlocked and surrounded by the Bucs making trade routes impossible England is blockaded and surrounded by France. Byzantium could potentially be trading with the USSR or Armenia but I wouldnt be surprised if Finland or Israel plundered their trade routes and havent been able to build any new ones due to needing more military units. They cant have had more than  routes due to their backwards tech. Ireland is also almost entirely surrounded by Icelandic ships but they might have a trade route or two with France Norway or Sweden since their southeast is for the moment clear.The only real surprise there is Persia. When they were at war they had a few cities away from the front lines with neighboring civs at peace for trade routes. I wonder whats going on there.,civbattleroyale,cxu86oj,6,t5_36z7e

6204641,0,t1_cyuw7jb,They are broken. If anything caused the BR Mk. I to crash it was Gran Colombia. The mod is really outdated so it had no chance of handling the massive scale of the BR. In fact all of Leugis mods are buggy in the BR. Tpang has to keep deleting Argentinian Great Generals because they keep spamming. Israel is somehow able to found a religion in five turns and spam scouts everywhere. And Chile is acting weird in some way that Tpang said in an Announcement after Part .Then in the first BR Gran Colombia crashed the game three separate times. The first time they crashed it and stuff went wrong so Tpang had to fix it. I forgot exaclty what happened. The second time he had to delete one of their cities that somehow got founded two tiles away from another to get it to work. And then the third time the game crashed all together and Gran Colombia was obviously the culprit. Tpang actually managed to delete Gran Colombia entirely from the game and it started working again but it didnt when it was still in the game. He was talking about this on CivFanatics. So he just rebooted the entire game and didnt use Gran Colombia.So Gran Colombia may work in smaller games because its not overstressed but the fact remains that it is volatile to break at any moment. So I would stay away from that civ unless you have to use it and any of Leugis civs that have reported issues for being outdated and such. So yes Gran Colombia is broken to a certain degree and needs to be seriously updated or completely remade.,civbattleroyale,cyuwh2r,1,t5_36z7e

SHITThe Great Pacific War is breaking out in its earnest as hundreds of thousands of men from four different nations live bleed and die from the burning red sands of the Outback to the oncepeaceful Indonesian isles Indonesian here! to all the way north to the Philippines in the bloodiest war since the Central Asian Sibir Conquests of the past centuries.I wish I could tell you more folks especially about the Inuit War in Canada or the Swedish Conquest of Europe but holy shit!Jandamarras Kimberley proves harder to crack as the largest navy the world has ever seen is taking massive losses against the steel hulled ships of the Kimberley while in the skies above fighters and bombers fight for dominance.But the Australian Army spearheaded by the Armys Digger Corps and supplemented by auxilliary Riflemen finally gets to see glory as they swarm across the red hot sands of the Outback capturing the all too vital city of Bydadanga and effectively turning the Kimberley into an entirely coastal empire  something the admirals and commodores of the Wobbegong Armada would be very happy to exploit.That is if the resurgent Kimberley navy crumbles easily. The Armada has lost their momentum in the Indian Ocean  and theres still a whole fleet of destroyers and carriers waiting in the Java Sea. Will we see the fall of Australia and with it the Home Fleet and the rise of the Kimberley?But something I cannot CANNOT understate is the fact that Brazil of all civs is the Firaxis Civ standing tall and proud amongst the great modded superpowers.They absolutely decimated Argentina playing them like a fiddle against the Inca. Looks like theres a clear dominant power in South America  with Chile a close second.Of course the Inuit have been making tremendous gains with Yanktons fall as the Ice Sheet Fleet consolidate control of Hudson Bay and the Inuit Army continue their solid push towards the greener parts of North America.The Buccaneers gain a solid foothold in Europe  becoming only the second transocean empire. And their proximity to the Equator may turn this gain into a game changing one.Its far too early to see who gains the most with these conquests  The Boers remain dormant for the time being their scientists working tirelessly to split the atom. Kuchum Khans Central Asian Empire hides a frightening navy in the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean.

Sparta recaptures Cumae and Ohrid repuppeting them in the process. Ireland is starting to recover. Jyvakyla is a megacity.AFRICAAs the continent is once again at peace not much has changed. The only real thing to note is that new Ethiopian city Awasa over near the citadel spam round Zabid way.ASIAOCEANIAIn the Middle East Armenia get round to annexing Bukhara. Nam annex Panduranga and Kimberley Mataram. The main man this part is is Parkes though who founds two new cities  Tabuk on Sulawesi and Tallaght near Kalumburu.AMERICASLook at that Inuit capturing spree! They also took Kiyaksa up north. Texas meanwhile annex Albany for what good it will do. Down south I forgot to do any of the Buccaneers puppet borders. Dohhh.

6979270,0,t3_4b9uie,As someone pointed out in another thread  million people died from the immediate effects of that bomb.  Given that the WWII era atomic bombs were not nearly powerful enough to destroy that much of even a densely populated city like Tokyo we have to assume that something else was responsible for most of the casualties.  The only explanation I can come up with is firestorms.  Massive unprecedented firestorms bigger than anything that happened to Hamburg Dresden or Tokyo on EarthPrime.  Firestorms that created their own local weather patterns and sucked in oxygen from miles around.  The prospects for what that must have been like for the people of Sydney... are absolutely harrowing.  In WWII firebombings people perished in the most horrifying ways.  Paved roads would become fatally hot.  Nowhere even the most advanced bomb shelters would be safe.  And then not long after another bomb was dropped.  This has been by far the single most brutal event that has happened in Battle Royale.  ,civbattleroyale,d17fsz8,5,t5_36z7e

6985297,0,t1_d184118,So this may be something weird about my play style but i never do grindy wars. Instead starting at either archer or composite bowmen and spearmen level I train  ranged units  seige units and  melee units to be super upgraded. All of them will have march the melee units will have cover against ranged attacks the archer units will have extra range and be able to shoot twice and more importantly shoot once and then move.Im then very careful to keep my units alive which is made easier and easier as their quality increases. I usually subjugated my entire continent in this way i mainly play on continents then I go into a building program to prepare for battleships which i do the same thing buildbuy all my battle ships from  city hopefully with brandenburg gate for  promotions right out of the gate. Very rarely do i ever lose any units... Sometimes i get new units that ill use to capture some cities and they are suicidal scout troops for my artillerybattleship targeting but my core army always survives.EditThis is by the way at emperordeity difficulty depends on how hard i want to work for it in a particular game.,civbattleroyale,d184gix,4,t5_36z7e

7003804,0,t3_4blehb,Its really hard to say because Civs model of tech advancement doesnt really create a world that looks like ours. You could say that the most technologically advanced civs such as the Boers and Inuit are the equivalent of first world countries in our world and the more backwards civs are the equivalent of third world countries. But even third world countries militaries use assault rifles APCs and tanks. Purchased from more advanced countries most of the time but the point is that they use them. Even the poorest subSaharan African countries in the world today dont have their soldiers still using pikes and crossbows.Point is that in Civ its quite possible to have a medieval country thats still sporting knights next to a postindustrial country with attack helicopters which simply wouldnt happen in real life because of how technological diffusion works.Not to mention how even the most advanced powers in the BR still have tons of less advanced units lying around its not like the IRL US still keeps a vast armada of sailing ships.,civbattleroyale,d1a8527,14,t5_36z7e
7004002,0,t1_d1a89i6,gt The groans of the dying and the blanched set faces of the dead ... were enough to drive away all unwholesome feelings of exultation and to remind one of the grim reality that war is. And even though these were the faces and the sufferings of our enemy one had ... a deeper sense of the common humanity which knows no racial distinctions.  Smuts in Memoirs of the Boer Wargt The Americans fight for a free world the English mostly for honour and glory and medals the French and Canadians decide too late that they have to participate.

Give me two divisions of those marvellous fighting Boers Meaning Farmer originating from the Boer War and I will remove Germany from the face of the earth.Field Marshal Bernard L. Montgomery Commander of the Allled forces during WWII.gt Take a community of Dutchmen of the type of those who defended themselves for fifty years against all the power of Spain at a time when Spain was the greatest power in the world. Intermix with them a strain of those inflexible French Huguenots who gave up their name and left their country forever at the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. The product must obviously be one of the most rugged virile unconquerable races ever seen upon the face of the earth. Take these formidable people and train them for seven generations in constant warfare against savage men and ferocious beasts in circumstances in which no weakling could survive place them so that they acquire skill with weapons and in horsemanship give them a country which is eminently suited to the tactics of the huntsman the marksman and the rider. Then finally put a fine temper upon their military qualities by a dour fatalistic Old Testament religion and an ardent and consuming patriotism. Combine all these qualities and all these impulses in one individual and you have the modern Boer.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,civbattleroyale,d1a8y3i,2,t5_36z7e

Unless of course you let us choose analised the situation and then made us pick a civ to replace.

The Arrow is considered to have been an advanced technical and aerodynamic achievement for the Canadian aviation industry. The CF Mark  held the promise of nearMach  speeds at altitudes of  feet  m and was intended to serve as the Royal Canadian Air Forces RCAF primary interceptor in the s and beyond.Context about why it is important to some Canadians in short it was during that magical era in the s when Canada was wanting to step into the light on an equal footing with both the UK and the US.Video of the first flight.Sorry if it seems like Im going hard on you. This was a fine write up under trying conditions. I just feel it is always a good idea to not throw silly lines like that without making sure you didnt research things.,civbattleroyale,d3rrn62,12,t5_36z7e
7791528,0,t3_4m1ek9,Okay. One thing Ive learned from watching a ton of AI games is that they truly are unpredictable. In one war where you expect a lot of progress to be made little territory changes hands like the Asian Khanflict and then suddenly one civ completely eviscerates a middletier power in one part. Just goes to show. Moroccans fought to the last man against the Buccs and Sparta at the same time.Some would call Morocco a Canadatier power so the fact that the Buccs utterly steamrolled them while the Inuit are only making slow steady progress against Canada speaks a lot about Buccaneer prowess. Canada was probably stronger than Morocco though. And the Canadian core is being thinned out of units now so the Inuit can only take more cities from here on unless they inevitably make a dumb peace deal.Religion Catholicism is decisively edging out Judaism now in both number of followers and number of cities. Mexico may end their war with the Blackfoot with an additional city or two. Progress in the atrocious terrain of the Rockies is always slow.And the Boers just completed two lategame wonders including the one that makes invasions practically impossible. No big deal.In other news Finland puts its shiny new Stealth Bombers to good use yet doesnt add a single new bordergore exclave. Well the bombers are getting experience at least and stealth bombers are nearly impossible to destroy I think.Meanwhile Armenia is actually holding out against Sparta better than expected considering they had more civilian units than military units at the start. With Jerusalem captured and Hebron about to be though that may soon change.Im interested to know if the air units in Hamilton were destroyed when Canada retook the city or if the Inuit got them out in time as the AI often does.,civbattleroyale,d3rtplf,29,t5_36z7e

Compare it with the way that the Boers rolled over Ethiopia The Inuit ploughed through Texas or Vietnam bulldozed Finlandia and Persia.  I mean even Korea are pushing through Yakutia at a far better rate than Brazil did Chile.  They got the job done but it wasnt particularly convincing.They have built up something of a navy yes but it is still outmatched by the Buccs.They may unify South America though more likely if for them to take the inland and West coast cities and enter a flip war for the North coast but even if they do its still South America the worst continental area for civ development in terms of population and production.They would need to take all of South America and keep on going up as far as the MexicoBlackfoot border to be considered a genuine challenger to the top  and I just cant see that happening at least not before the Inuts or Aussies start bashing on their borders and grinding up their units.,civbattleroyale,d7uk43j,3,t5_36z7e

The reason and cause of you being potentially offended is the fact that you chose a religious attitude in the first place if you can call it a religion which should be up to debate.... Its not reddit doing any harm  its your choice  putting yourself in this snowflake position. I do not care at all for offended religious feelings  the pain is self inflicted... If you want to censor your own life with religious guidelines  you are welcome. To go on reddit to tell others how to censor their remarks and comments even beforehand is the kind of whining missionary approach that I utterly disapprove of. Stay at home with your religion any religion that is! censor your religious comrades if they share your belief and if you need to spread your word  but do not come on reddit to give anyone a manual how not to hurt your delicately groomed feelings...! p.     ,civbattleroyale,dc5if0x,-3,t5_36z7e
10246765,0,t1_dc5iqyq,Oh I know that irreverence is part of the CBR. Thats why I was trying to help lay out whats considered majorly offensive to Mormons since a lot of people know where those boundaries lay with Muslims Jews etc. but in my experience not nearly as many know where they lay with Mormons. Magic underwear is one thats usually considered to be quite malicious and I know that a lot of people dont know that since thats one of the things they hear referred to about Mormons. I mean if someone makes a comment about it appears their temple garments have shielded Deserets troops from the worst of the damage in this battle thats really not offensive. If the same situation is described as Friggin Mormon magic underwear! thats fairly offensive. And a lot of people wouldnt know that. Magic underwear specifically is a loaded term for a lot of Mormons since were used to usually hearing it involved in some sort of attack or expression of extreme disdain for our religion.I think your last sentence is pretty much what I was trying to go for with this thread as well as kinda plead that they not cross lines that they wouldnt be willing to cross for other religions in the game. Trust me I dont want to spoil anyones fun I just want to help people not be accidentally malicious towards the religion in relation to the other ingame religions since a lot of people honestly dont know where the general vicinity of the line between playfully irreverent and maliciously offensive is when it comes to Mormons in particular.

10400499,0,t3_5owwns,Seems reddit ate up the accompanying text justifying my picks...Anyway.First priority is to prevent someone forwardsettling the capital crippling the civ.Being only  tiles away the Turks are by far the biggest threat in this regard followed closely by the Goths.By settling  and  before anyone else does we effectively shut the Turks out of Europe forcing them to either go deep into Anatolia or settle isolated Morea peninsula.Whats more this pattern creates a concave border effectively funneling Wallachian units towards the Turkish capital. Lots more space for attacking melee units as well as archers in the back. Settling this way provides Wallachia the best chance by far of taking an enemy capital. In fact I wouldnt be surprised if they were the first to do so in the game. is vulnerable to the Goths but thats where the fortified Church UB comes in. can also be settled  tile to the south to place it on the hill. The Goths will have plenty of space to expand elsewhere and not settling here opens up the Wallachian core.Since the Papal states are liable to settle Italy first before moving out its a safe bet  will still be open for the second settler who pops out. It provides a port from which to dominate the Adriatic and locks down all of Illyria from foreign settlement. Together with  and the soon to be captured Turkish capital it will provide the basis for a Mediterranean navy. doesnt have to be in that exact spot. Its main purpose is to block the Battlepope allowing Vlad Tepes to keep the entire Pannonian Plain for himself. Protected by mountains and hills it will be hard for the Pope to make a breakthrough here and its likely he doesnt even try and instead tries to contest France with the Dutch and the Moors as well as inevitably getting into a naval war with the Vandals. is placed right behind mountains and with the remaining rough terrain will provide a very hard to crack fortress defending against possible Prussian attacks both mountain passes leading south. Additionally it provides a stepping stone along with  for expanding either north or west.,civbattleroyale,dcmyorg,13,t5_36z7e
10423383,0,t1_dcozjs6,I did some more research and yes Seleucus was the general of Alexander the Great who inherited the conquered Persian Achaemenid Empire. However the empire he founded was not the Parthian Empire but the Seleucid Empire. Parthia was a rebellious province of the Seleucid Empire and its satrap was eventually overthrown by Arsaces I chieftain of the Iranian Parni tribe. Mithridates I who eventually conquered the Seleucid Empire for the Parthians was a descendant of Arsaces brother Tiridates and therefore ethnically Parni. Thus although interbreeding with Greeks MAY have occurred the Parthian royal family traced its roots to indigenous Iranians and moreover they claimed they were descended from the Persian Achaemenid kings. So your claim that Mithridates I was a man born of Hellenic blood is either false or misleading.Furthermore from what Ive read the Parthian kings were Zoroastrians not Olympians styled themselves as Shahanshah not Basileus identified as philhellenes on their coinage friends of the Greeks i.e. not Greeks themselves and presided over a revival of Iranian culture. And it goes without saying that the average person would not have been ethnically Greek  or spoken it as uNurseMichael said. Thus while Parthia was certainly a Hellenized empire neither its rulers nor its people were ethnically Greek and the empire represents a gradual move away from Greek culture back to Iranian culture. Frankly using Greek Pride to describe Parthia is even less accurate than using it to describe Ptolemaic Egypt whose rulers WERE Greeks. Its like using American Pride to describe the Philippines.P.S. I dont mean this as a personal attack in any way  I just really like historical debates!,civbattleroyale,dcpk5kp,5,t5_36z7e

Unfortunately the hiatus was announced before we got that far so I figured I might as well make one for Part  for when Mark II returned.  While that hasnt happened yet I decided it would be better just to post this to help breath life back into this sub.  The map for part  was admittedly rushed in order to post it before the next part was released.  As such it had couple of errors  Id like to claim that I caught all of them in this version but Im sure Ive overlooked something the most likely place for there to be errors is in Australian Polynesia which hasnt appeared in the slides for a few parts though likely would have soon considering the war between Australia and BrazilInuit.
