6696505,0,t1_d0b1opz,A very highly geared player by himself runs upon a group of three which is clearly very poorly geared.  They tell him to surrender or he will get rekt.  Knowing that his gear is so much better he was confident they stood no chance and calls their bluff.  Shoot me.  You wont live.  They pause a moment go back to talking in another language then open fire.  The guy had wheeled around lining two of the guys up.  DMRs tend to have huge headshot bonuses.  A blue I had would do k to mobs and something like .k on low geared players.  Given he has a purple with probably the top gear he did enough damage to oneshot the first guy and gets the next in just a few more rounds.  Last guy doesnt go down in the few rounds he has left in his DMR so he pulls out the orange assault rifle and hip fires him down.  He then stands over the three of them and says I told you.  Two of the three give up to respawn and the third sticks around while wounded.  The lone wolf waits until the last second of the rogue timer and then kills him.,The_Division,d0bz5zw,4,t5_2zwq0

When the game launches to a black screen hit AltEnter. This switches the game to fullscreen windowed mode and displays correctly.. Go to video settings change back to fullscreen and change resolution to the displays resolution.. Exit game and relaunch it..

8312502,0,t3_4te76u,Hi Mate this is nothing new. I have been using a shotgun with Sentry since . and it was as effective then as it is now. The build has grown in popularity and with massive adding  extra DMG to shotguns plus a  PvP flat DMG buff shotguns w Sentry become a powerful option. At one point me and my team mate were the only ones using shotguns out of a group of about  regular team mates. I wouldnt say this build is as problematic as the TankTician build as I have before . come up against a single TankTician vs   shotgunners and we have been made to look like fools as he just ran around healing and we were unable to take him down. Its still an issue but with the  buff TankTicians dont last as long.I can see what your saying but this is definitely nothing new and if you come up against PvP shotgunners the only tip I have is remain out of optimal range. The drop off outside of the shotguns optimal range is severe. Also use Smart Cover and synchronised focus fire with team mates.

8924433,0,t3_52h6nh,Hi Matt!I think the negativity stems from different experiences maybe? I for one fall in that negative category for sure. The game has its issues and fixes arent handled swiftly or at least in a timelier manner. And the guys on PC have to deal with extreme cheating too. I dunno about it being hard. Ive never tried heroic stuff. But on challenging I personally hate putting two or three magazines in a guys face to drop him. If the enemies were monsters or aliens maybe that pill would be easier to swallow. Your successful because maybe you can pour more time in and or maybe u have a very solid group? my abilities go grey at the worse possible times. I have to kill myself just to have them come back. And I get stuck to stuff in the environment occasionally. The fact that u havent experienced any bugs is amazing.  true. GS doesnt matter. But it does because it gets u from getting kicked sometimes. A good set Frankenstein etc is always going to be better than score. But for some reason not everyone knows that.  no no. The majority of the time your getting kicked for crap gear score. I have a great reclaimer build that focuses on support station and smart cover. In fact I do amazing in dragons nest. But the gs is low and the majority of the time I spend at least  minutes getting kicked.  I dont think the game is hard. In fact I like how mechanical the incursions are. Adds a bit of difficulty but its not crazy hard or impossible. What makes things difficult is when your starved for ammo and the enemy requires tons of bullets to drop. PvE NPC time to kill is too high. And that does add another challenge. And as soon as someone in your squad goes down the challenge gets harder because its  against the enemy. Now imagine . Or  even. Im glad you dont have to experience the nasty side of things. Sadly many of us arent in the same boat as you. We cant matchmake in the dz with random because thats usually not going to go right. We have to matchmake for a long time before finding the right group. And we go up the ladder slower. Take care agent! ,The_Division,d7kl3p0,2,t5_2zwq0

Especially if you figure out how much you need to get some of the objective based caches loot X amount of things kill X number of enemies etc. You could rush through those and then die and get the caches in shorter time periods. That time to loot ratio might be pretty good. On top of that I dont think I saw anyone open a cache that had less than  items and a few were . So if you won got  caches from the score based results and  from extraction and  of those gave  items per that would be   GS pieces in under  hours.

Thats foregoing all armor on your mods which means your going to be squishy as hell. Then you could likely get  from fierce in the free slot and then Vicous is worth  but only when above two health segments. And then you can get another  from savage but only when the enemy is out of cover. I guess its possible that he could use adept but again another . situational and only for a brief time. Besides to unlock that viscous and fierce all at the same time you need crazy electronics. So best case scenario youre prob looking at  situationally base CHC excluding adept. Pulse base is like . CHC. So sure he could have  SITUATIONALLY but at the cost of a LOT of armor and also having to dump into electronics. So yeah... He was full of crap. ,The_Division,dax74vs,3,t5_2zwq0

10234404,0,t3_5mj1n1,The answer is yes. DPS in this game is based on every stat weirdly thats why snipers and shotguns have deflated dps. Due to some stats being extremely low sniper reload and mag size amp shotguns low range and mag size. Marksman rifles benefit the most from this system due to all their stats being relatively high so they will usually have the biggest DPS numbers in the game this effect is pushed even harder by the fact that the ScarH has a mag size of  which raises its DPS even more than other Marksman Rifles.

10870158,0,t1_de03s13,This is the only known  fix. Straight from Ubisoft support I submitted a formal ticket to them about this in December.What needs to be known is connecting is not a timebased thing. Sitting and waiting for connection will not do anything. It will either connect upon load of the Connecting screen or it wont. Its basically a standard loading screen.What that means is if you dont get connected by the time the little tic of the animation think of the circle as a clock approaches roughly a quarter past just give up. Quit to home close the game app and try again or go online and unlink but that can take  minutes for their servers to update.Sometimes joining a friends session gets you in sooner. But that can be hit or miss.Ive tried for as long as  minutes of reattempting to get in. Other times I get in without issue. It sucks.Silver lining is this once the game loads you to character select you will always load the game as long as the game was not shut down at the system level. So if you logout of your game put the PS system in Rest Mode and load back in you will always Reconnect properly. Its the initial Connecting load that is the issue. Youll see a server disconnected error when reloading in this manner but disregard it youll connect just fine when you move past it.Sadly all their support had to tell me back when I filed the report was that a fix was coming. Obviously its been over  months without a hotfix so who knows when thatll actually happen.My suggestion follow these steps and get yourself in and playing. But please do all of us suffering from this issue a favor and file a formal bug report with Ubisoft. Talking on here wont help anyone get it fixed. They need to know how widespread the issue is and how many are affected by it.Good luck. ,The_Division,de16gtv,3,t5_2zwq0

The only real problem with the vendor at this point is that people dont trust massive in the slightest and have no faith in Ubisoft. If they were to turn round and say if million gamers all bought just . of credits we would made the dlc for the rest of the year free people would probably jump on board really fast! Its the fact they have added it and gave no other details of what will happen with the season pass year  that has caused some concerns for the community. For example if ever user say million did buy  of the credits this would be million quid in the pockets of massive and surely way more then enough to get them through year two?! But saying that if  million users and half bought the season pass at  each thats still million! So they could be greedy and just use the vendor as a xmas bonus system for their staff for all we know!

11215152,0,t1_df2tm4w,I have gone through legendary without my shield going down. However if you build ballistic you are an electronics tank. You need at least k skillpower. As for threat use high threat weapons with a golden rhino. I manage to get everyone or almost firing at me within  seconds of firing. If youre not using a shield you need high health on kill so that you may keep firing. Predatory is also great. There are ways Ive made it work. However it falls appart in PVP since the tank tools only apply in pve.,The_Division,df382my,1,t5_2zwq0

11240818,0,t3_60gdk2,What was the original stat roll before  firearms? Id say EDR and health are the best  majors on a chest piece. In saying that tho at least you have health on if I had to be missing one it would be EDR. ,The_Division,df64pbe,2,t5_2zwq0

Id like a Division with more Skill diversity st person not rd person and Gear with fixed stats not this Looter style RNG bullshit.But people who like it like it is now can go on in Division  as long as there are enough players.,The_Division,dg5u5xm,1,t5_2zwq0

11563521,0,t1_dg607im,See youre looking at it from a strategic point of view. I completely agree. However my post was about v mostly I did comment on them being useless but my main pet peeve is just its sheer ability to get cheap kills. Ive literally ran away from an Airburst covered a few feet by the time they hit the air and got a good distance away to still be staggered burned and then shot with me being able to do absolutely NOTHING. I hate it with a passion. Strategic yes I see exactly what you mean. But running around the DZ one shoting people or just a v in Last Stand is fucking annoying ,The_Division,dg6qaoe,0,t5_2zwq0
11563806,0,t1_dg6e923,Not me but the great uzeospantera can. Heres his general overview. I personally have audio technica athms without a mic and the Phillips shp  with the princess Leia modI really enjoyed the muddled bass punchiness of the ms which are one of the most popular entry level quality headphones. They are closed and great for music in general. You can get the better version Mx if you want the VMODA boom mic cable.The shp is open backed but I closed it with lamb leather ear pads  and d printed cups filled with foam  showed in the linked video. That mod was well worth the extra money as it made the headphones have deeper boomier bass yet it wasnt muddled like the ms and made the whole sound experience much crisper and just... Wew so good. Another comparison and this is more of a general headphone thing but closed headphones have a narrow soundstage and open headphones have a very open and wide soundstage. The bigger the soundstage the more the sound sounds like its happening around you instead of in your head. I stopped listening to the ms completely shortly after getting the shp and modding it as the sound overall was crisp cleaner and more immersive even though I closed the headphones with the cups and earpads the soundstage is still pretty wide as its designed to be open and has many open back design benefits.Any other questions let me know,The_Division,dg6rglu,1,t5_2zwq0
