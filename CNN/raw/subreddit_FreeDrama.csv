10471683,0,t1_dcp90lu,Does appear to be that way.Essentially Pandoras Box has been unleashed on multiple subs.I hear the faint cries in the distance.. they say..RRRRRREEEEEEE,FreeDrama,dcv2myx,2,t5_3asxh
10472746,0,t3_5pzkhp,Amazing. Also look at the stickied thread.They  made it a far left subreddit in such an explicit way that they now use the approved posters systen.Not that I ever had a doubt but its clear that I have always been  correct in my assessment including yesterday and that I called it months ago.,FreeDrama,dcv6zgj,13,t5_3asxh
10482766,0,t1_dcwbl1s,They have people who post in CB and SRS on the mod team now its crazy how far that sub has fallen in just a few months.   All that election bullshit gave them a window and they took it.I dont know why they need yet another circlebroke sub to whine about the evil alt right nazis.    Youd think theyd be happy once they took over SRD but its apparently never enough for them.,FreeDrama,dcwbvt3,2,t5_3asxh
