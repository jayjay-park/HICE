2764132,0,t3_2rp3ik,These are beautiful.. I really like the useabsence of light it creates a brilliant atmosphere. Did you edit the levels on these once on dry land? Thanks for posting,underwaterphotography,cni9rjj,3,t5_2tn4v
2809920,0,t1_cnmlmil,Thanks for the advice!Follow up question do you think the new divers should ditch filming all together or would be able to point a gopro at stuff during their rdth dive?,underwaterphotography,cnnh9df,1,t5_2tn4v
3050144,0,t3_2u8mr8,Looks great. Your thumbnails are a bit off though. They dont showcase the best part of the picture but the top left corner. I know it will be hassle to find a way to create individual thumbnails but his way there are too many pictures I will never see because the thumb is boring.,underwaterphotography,coe59az,1,t5_2tn4v

4641441,0,t3_3eiznu,Videos are private. I havent played with them but I know certain video editing software will allow you to pull shadows contrast and change white balance to the video as you would adjust a photo in lightroom. Im in a group on Facebook that is a little crazy about making videos. Maybe there is a subreddit similar to rPhotoshop that might be able to do ac request?,underwaterphotography,ctfmc0u,2,t5_2tn4v
5791011,0,t3_3ufm33,There is far too many alternate hoses hanging down and split fins in this video in the first  seconds for me to watch anymore...,underwaterphotography,cxexh9k,1,t5_2tn4v
6671146,0,t3_4710ua,If this is your first ever dive I would recommend NOT bringing a camera at all.  Youll have enough to keep track of learning scuba diving without fiddling with a camera.  See if the tour operator does a videophoto package and youll probably end up with better shots that include you and your wife having fun together.,underwaterphotography,d09cr5s,3,t5_2tn4v
