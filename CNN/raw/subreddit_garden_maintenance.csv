7278962,0,t1_d25e9nm,Thanks! Took the pictures to another exterminator who agreed that its voles.  Will have a look for the Castor oil and give it a shot. Exterminator wanted  for the service call plus  for some poison to lay down some traps and bait... Seems like I can afford to try a few things first before bringing in the big guns P ,garden_maintenance,d25ki9d,1,t5_2zdqy

9177704,0,t1_d8cxnoh,There hasnt been rain for a few days and I havent watered it. I did spray it with a fungicide after yesterday it seemed to be getting worse. Now just looks worse than yesterday but the top looks good. Tho I have also seen it try moving up more. I also remove the bad leaves. ,garden_maintenance,d8fcaf2,1,t5_2zdqy
