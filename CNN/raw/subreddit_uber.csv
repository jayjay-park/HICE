If you have any discrepancy of prices always rate the driver on the job heshe did because we have absolutely no way of controlling that. We touch  buttons on our phone Accept trip arrivingstart trip and end trip. We cant control anything else. The best way to handle that would be give the driver an appropriate rating then email your local uber about your worries with the price. This hurts a lot of us drivers. Im sure Ive gotten low ratings from surge pricing. I had a lady in my car once that was extremely unhappy for having to pay  dollars for a  minute trip but it was completely out of my control. ,uber,cj91r9t,8,t5_2t1iv

So we would get pinged while on route to your first destination new feature that pings drivers while on trip for next ride pax to pick up a fare which we obviously cannot accept because we have another stop. Which kills our acceptance rate and fucks with what ever extremely hard to get promotion uber is offering.  And then if we just put in the final destination and have to go off course to the first drop off... we risked you contesting the fare. My advice. Take Lyft with multi stop trips.

Maybe you dont seem to understand what industries typically include tipping?As a rider you are not obligated to offer your driver a gratuity in cash. If you decide you would like to tip your driver is welcome to accept.So not Uber. Despite your carefullychosen weasel words nobody has an obligation to tip you. For some reason it is only in the USA that they have created this hypertipping culture absent in just about every other part of the world except in fine dining and slow food. Even then most americans seem to not tip their Uber driver anyways. Fine by me  it should be  voluntary. Service people tend to not beg for tips in my area of the world.gtIf anyone should get a job its you Mr. Broke Ass I have to use Uber to get Around bum.Not only are you dumb as hell and assuming I use Uber in the first place but then you make an equally dumb as hell statement implying you have to be poor to use Uber.Listen bub I got my own ride.

11108762,0,t1_der049w,People typically dont bring up tax and payroll in a traditional job because they dont pay the entire portion.With a rideshare business to the extent that earnings are taxable you do.  You know how you pay a few percent to Social Security and Medicare on your personal paycheck?  Your employer has to pay on that as well but if youre operating a rideshare business you are also the employer meaning you pay BOTH parts rather than just the employee portion.  Source taxes and financials are my day jobTheres also the difference between a car that is nearly  years old as you mentioned driving yourself and a new car which ALL autonomous cars will be.  With this in mind depreciation is a factor.I believe hour is possible despite all this I tend to average hour after expenses doing rideshare during my spare time before or after my day job but it should be noted that most of the profit here comes in the form of tips from passengers not the payment on the trip itself.  Adjusted for cost of living Im probably more profitable at the end of the day than you are Texas is cheap to live in.  The west coast is not.Couple this in with having a fleet of vehicles rather than your one car which is fewer than five and if you have five or more you are required to actualize expenses rather than deduct for mileage and theres even less of a tax break.Granted with selfdriving vehicles theres also no employee driving them so you save on payroll taxes there but you also probably need to have mechanics onhand to fix problems that pop up or pay even more for outside mechanics to do so...the costs do add up quickly.Im willing to bet that your nearly  year old vehicle is not a Cadillac or Buick or BMW which is something key to note as expenses on those cars are going to be more indicative of repair and maintenance than a Ford or a Honda or a Hyundai or a Toyota etc.  Those cars are typically far more expensive for such due to having more electronic parts which any selfdriving car will have...on crack.All that said I do believe it could be viable to have an ondemand rideshare service by autonomous cars myself...just not in the next  years as the technology will simply cost too much prior.

They told me there was no suspicious activity at all since the incident but would be monitoring it a lot more since I let them know and will be in constant update with me about any and all purchases until I get my credit card and cancel this previous card. ,uber,df4z5hn,1,t5_2t1iv

11535397,0,t1_dg3j394,Yeah. Theres a group of three men robbing uber drivers in Santiago they rob them of everything including their cars  Maybe  weeks ago or so one driver refused to say good bye to his car so they murdered him. I definietely understand that uber drivers overall have it worse than passengers.Just today though my uber driver started the journey without me and I was really stumped and the app didnt have a button for what the fuck Im not in the car. It was then cancelled later on I was charged for the trip that I took. The driver agreed to come back and do the journey in order to not get reported but it still gave me the heebie jeebies getting in a car when its no longer an official uber fare now its just a man Ive never met before...,uber,dg3jflp,4,t5_2t1iv
11535412,0,t3_64ljpz,I imagine an open source crowd source version of ride share. Where little percentage goes to developers and most goes to drivers Uber could increase rider rates  and only take  off the cost and still make billions unfortunately there is severe exceutive mismanagement.

Dont expect it to get any better at the current rates drivers are mad and all they can do is take it out on the nontipping passengers.Im not saying this is right but it is the current reality of the situation.,uber,dgsqpm5,2,t5_2t1iv
