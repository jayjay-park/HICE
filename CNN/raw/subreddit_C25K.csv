36563,0,t1_ceikv3i,Ive been questioning myself too.I dont think my lung capacity changed much Im ish my lung dont move much anymore.But more the way I breath.

63879,0,t3_1ut4xf,Thats great BDD but Im guessing that youve been into various fitness programs for a while.  Im honestly coming from the couch.  Theres a big difference between doing a bunch of things at once and starting multiple things at once.  You probably recover faster when its not entirely new.  I want to get to the point where I can go crazy with squats and lunges and still run less than  hours later but this week showed that Im still in eitheror land.,C25K,celpajz,1,t5_2rgoq

I quit smoking cold turkey in November and my coworker dared me to try Ck as a substitute addiction. I have not ran since I did track in middle school and always hated it.

158429,0,t1_cewfsey,Ha! Youre like my reddit husband PYou should really try it. I never thought Id be making such progress but a lot of it is psychological breaking past certain barriers we self impose. It starts off in small increments and builds from there. You can visualize the program here I used to do other types of cardio at the gym elliptical bike walking. Never thought Id be running until quite recently. Id recommend getting fitted for good shoes at your local running shoe store  that was key for me. And then ease into it youll be amazed and so proud of yourself!Im older than you so if I can do it you can too If Im  honest I dont love running while im running but that feeling I get at the end of a run is the reason I put myself through it,C25K,cewh7e8,1,t5_2rgoq

200812,0,t3_1wdpdi,Not a big deal... if you go at a slow and steady pace. A lot of folks make break throughs in w in terms of endurance. Dont worry about speed at all especially in the first running segment. Then if you want to try picking up the pace a bit on the following running segments.

423909,0,t3_1yx566,I have but I am running completely unshod. Ive noticed that my gait tends to get a little wonky if I try to go too fast so Im working on slowing it down and focusing on my form instead. Could it be that youre pounding the pavement too hard? I tried running in VFFs to start but had all sorts of issues with shin splints knee pain etc. So I took some time off and started again but with no shoes. All my probs disappeared. I think its possible that the shoes  are giving you a false sense of security so maybe youre landing too hard. Just a suggestion. You might want to post over at rbarefoot and rbarefootrunning for more help. A lot of the runners were minimalist shoes and are always asking for advice on things. ,C25K,cfopbm2,2,t5_2rgoq

467468,0,t3_1zfxxa,Congratulations on getting started!Hopefully CK will change your mind about running. But if not dont force yourself to keep doing it find something else you like to do. Id only advise someone to run for fitness even if they hate it if they hate every other form of exercise too in that case running is the most efficient.Remember the old saying though You cant outrun a bad diet. Exercise will make you hungrier. I did a lot of cycling in  and managed to gain  lb. most of it during the period I was cycling the most. Keep an eye on your appetite if you want to keep losing weight.,C25K,cftei7q,2,t5_2rgoq

Plus doing my own timekeeping would mean Id have to check my watch constantly which would make it seem so much longer.With apps someone tells me when to walk when to run as well as how far Im running and what my pace is which tells me if Im improving. I dont have to think about anything when Im running except for encouraging myself to keep going.

After W circumstances intervened with my training and I didnt run for almost a week straight. When I finally went out and did WD I ran through my cooldown and finished with .K. Take the time you need to heal your ankle and dont panic about lost progress. If anything I think its probably more important to maintain the habit of working out. So maybe do an ab workout every day instead or swimming rowing machine. Id stay away from anything involving your legs for at least a few days to best allow your ankle to recover. But take a deep breath its not the end of the world. ,C25K,ci6kj9k,1,t5_2rgoq

1420831,0,t1_citzzf2,This is what Im doing as well.  With the wd run I did a . minute mile instead of a  minute mile which means I ended up not running very far distancewise.

1496388,0,t3_2b9sgv,This can be purely psychological too.  Even though it feels like its impossible or hard to do.. just putting pressure on yourself can make things harder.  I would say go for Week  not expecting to complete it.  If you do GREAT.  Otherwise you can try it again or continue working on Week .  I am still continuing with CK even though I ran . miles for  minutes straight a few days ago.  Why?  Because for some reason the runs are a lot harder when im tracking myself and following the program.  But when I ran for  minutes I didnt track it all... there was no pressure.  See what im getting at it?Try week  but go in to it with no expectations.  It will probably reveal whether or not your brain is playing tricks on you.,C25K,cj3ui69,1,t5_2rgoq

I was so excited that I ran as fast as I could for those last  seconds and almost threw up. Whenver I feel miserable and want to quit I keep repeating to myself this is what I want this is what it takes and somehow I make it out alive every time.

CK along with a better diet has helped me drop  lbs! I can now run  minutes straight without wanting to jump off a cliff. I know this sounds super cliche but You. Can. Do. It!

This morning was even worse when I woke up due to not wanting to get out of bed legs were incredibly sore from doing squats the day before and I pretty much felt like warmed over poo but I stuck it out and went to the park for my run.  Halfway through I started to feel like I wanted to quit and my speed was starting to drop as well but I kept telling myself Id never forgive myself if I gave up now and failed.  I kept pushing and before I knew it the app alerted me it was time for the cool down walk.  My speed still sucks but I couldnt be happier ,C25K,ckgali8,1,t5_2rgoq

1894524,0,t3_2gbm7s,I have yet to do a k but I have done two Ks now and both have involved bridges. The first was a fun run in Portland OR which I did because it went over the I bridge which normally has no pedestrian access. I really like bridges so I wanted to take pictures from up there since it would be closed to cars and open to runnerswalkerscyclists. That one wasnt timed and since I mostly did that to take pictures I pretty much walked the whole thing.Today was different  this was a timed khalf marathon starting on the Bridge of the Gods which connects Oregon and Washington over the Columbia River. This is the first timed race I ever did! Since the Bridge of the Gods is otherwise closed to pedestrian access I made it a point to walk across into Washington while I had the opportunity before the race started. Doing that put my way behind at the start since the starting line was at the very end of the Oregon side of the bridge. I wasnt too concerned about that though since my pace is still pretty slow and I knew I wasnt going to do the whole thing without slowing to a walk at all  which I was able to limit to just the uphill climbs!  so I dont think it cost me too much and the views from walking across were TOTALLY worth it!Anyway it was a ton of fun D I havent gotten my official time yet but based on my app I think I was around a  min mile pace. Not a superstar time by any stretch BUT before I did Ck there is no way Id be able to sustain even that kind of a pace for a very hilly k. It was actually really cool to be running through mile  thinking This feels good and I can keep going! Once I can easily do k with a  minmile pace I think Ill do the actual bridge to k program will be neat to see how much Ive improved if I run this race again next year! ,C25K,ckhhb27,1,t5_2rgoq

Heres my personal reasoning behind each if that helps in any way.I counted it during the first  weeks or so and chose to increase my cooldown at the end until Id runwalked the full k distance. I think that helped me both by helping me learn exactly how far a k is and by setting a baseline time for seeing how much Ive improved when adding more running to the mix over time.Now that Im past intervals and heading into week  I try not to count it because my new goal isnt just to make it through a k but to be able to run the entire way.,C25K,cklu9rt,2,t5_2rgoq

3191447,0,t1_cossa8n,Basically it works like the regular ck app but outside of the drills it incorporates freeform runs pushing you farther. I found it both harder and easier than the regular app. Theres no  min run until week  but the runs are about  minutes in average so youre actually building up a better base to develop on.Outside of that youre playing the role of runner  in a world devastated by a zombie uprising. Youre being trained up as a runner to help the little township of Abel out. As youre running you follow a story.Its pretty hard to explain so have a quick google there are a lot of blogs out there who explain it a lot better than me!I used the regular ck programme  years ago but crashed out in week  and never found the motivation to return as its so boring.

3261163,0,t3_2xbwcz,I agree that theres not much point to CK if youve already reached the point of running for  minutes. The one exception is if youre getting injured or experiencing pain while running or afterwards CK builds up slowly because running puts a lot of stress on your legs especially feet and knees and they usually adapt to that stress more slowly than your cardiovascular system adapts to the demands that running places on it. The consequence is that new runners who do too much too soon often end up with overuse injuries.Like ugeluemse says as you run longer distances youll get faster at shorter distances. You can also do speedwork but I would advise waiting until youve been running for at least  months since it puts even more strain on your bones muscles and ligaments.,C25K,cp014el,1,t5_2rgoq
3265275,0,t1_cp0fc5k,If youre feeling sore by the end of a run Id advise taking a few days off. My rule of thumb is that a pain that disappears during the run is OK a pain that is fairly minor but doesnt go away is a sign to take a rest day or three and an acute pain that doesnt disappear or that gets worse is a sign to stop the run NOW and not run again until the pain is gone.,C25K,cp0gv7t,1,t5_2rgoq
3283725,0,t3_2xq2i2,I dont think you cheated heres why... I run outside and theres no way I keep the same pace the whole run interval. My RunDouble app confirms this for me.

I just finished WD today and I am sorta scared of D since it will be the longest continuous stretch of running Ive done in a long long time! Get well soon! ,C25K,cp2kkvu,7,t5_2rgoq
3284468,0,t3_2xq2i2,Cheated by slowing down? Hell no not in the least. This program is about endurance not speed. Lowering speed is one of the tricks to increasing endurance. And when you start building mileage increasing endurance is one of the tricks to increasing speed. Slow is fast as they say. So you succeeded period  no question no equivocation no doubt. You did this and congratulations for it! Way to go runner! You can try going back to your predetermined speed if you wish for W but Ill warn you that W is a deceptive little bugger and a lot of people find it harder than expected. Seems like walking intervals would be easier but youre still doing more total work than you were before and it can be a stretch. My advice would be to go whatever speed it takes to get the duration done. When youve finished the whole program then work on speed. ,C25K,cp2nmim,5,t5_2rgoq

The amount of stress on your feet shouldnt be a significant issue unless something is just massively wrong.  Do you HAVE foot problems? Regardless Im going to make a different suggestion at least for the short term. For right now go to your local Walmart and get some ProFoot memory foam insoles.  Theyre amazing and reasonably cheap.  They conform to your foot in a way that I never thought would be possible with something so inexpensive and they might just address your problem sufficiently.

4525561,0,t3_3d1yoy,I just did wd today! One big thing Id recommend is really upping your daily water consumption.  Cramps are not always contributed to electrolyte imbalances but also dehydration. It also helps with recovery. Working on getting a well balanced diet is going to be key in improving endurance and reducing fatigue. If you eat like crap your performance will be poor. Im not saying you need to make massive changes. But little things can make a big difference. I understand being on a poor college student budget. Adding veggies is cheap and reasonable. Like buy a bag of frozen broccoli and add some to your mac n cheese. Protein will also be important too. Are you taking a multivitamin? That can help restore some of your missing vitamins and minerals that youre not getting in your diet. Good luck! Youre doing great! ,C25K,ct132rt,1,t5_2rgoq
4530777,0,t3_3d401c,If you can run in the evening or morning do so. Even when I was young and foolish the hottest I would run was C and that was when I weighed  kg same height as you and had acclimated myself to the weather by running as it gradually warmed up.Two suggestions regarding speed and form Can you talk in complete sentences when you run? If not then youre going too fast. Slow down until you can. CK is about endurance running not sprinting. One of the best things you can do to improve running form is to work on your cadence steps per minute. Many beginning runners are essentially running in slow motion with a low cadence  steps per minute or even lower. Experienced longdistance runners i.e. anything longer than a mile tend to have higher cadences.  steps per minute is often recommended as a training target. My average cadence these days is between  and  depending on the run though it goes higher in a fast finish.A higher cadence does a number of good things for your form. It encourages landing in the middle of the foot not the heel which puts less stress on the foot and ankle. It leads to less bouncing which puts less stress on the musculoskeletal system as a whole and wastes less energy moving up and down. It encourages landing with your foot under your body not in front of it which means your leg doesnt act as a brake. For a heavy person all three are important ways to reduce the impact of running.A small electronic metronome or a metronome app can help.,C25K,ct1qna5,2,t5_2rgoq

4602408,0,t3_3dyrv5,It will probably take some trial and error to find a routine that works for you so try not to get disheartened or frustrated if it seems hard at first. If getting up for a run first thing in the morning is too hard switch it up and try going in the evening instead. If you feel faint or dizzy during your run try having a small snack and some water before you head out  some people do better on an empty stomach some people need more fuel. The key is getting a routine thats sustainable for you. A mistake that a lot of people make is wanting to start exercising thinking that means getting up at the crack of dawn to go for a run followed by a protein smoothie and a spin class  you might be able to do that for a week or two but you likely wont be able to stick with that kind of routine long term. So ease in to it and just figure out something that youll be able to keep doing for a long time it took me a while to just accept that getting up at am for a run was not realistic for me. I go for my runs after work now and its much easier for me to keep up with.Thats my two cents! ,C25K,ctapz1i,1,t5_2rgoq

5944217,0,t1_cxyqfl8,Thank you. That was a thorough explanation of pretty much every thing Im thinking about.What to do when the imminent injurycut happened is the biggest worry Ive had. Tape up and move on seems as clear an advice as any. I already know what you mean by the body shifting its weight almost magically when I step on some super sharp gravel. The feet look out for each other instinctively I think. Where I live freezing cold is never a problem. Scorching heat can be an issue but Im also running early morning these days so Im good for a little more time. Im planning to buy some Xeros but not yet. I want to try completely unshod for a couple more months at least. Another aspect of barefoot running is that I now know the texture or feel of material Ive never known. The white paint on road divider lines is very soft under the feet and its so relaxing to run on it when possible. Whod have thunk? ,C25K,cxytex8,2,t5_2rgoq

6004831,0,t1_cy6p7ss, Running every other day go for it. I think the extra rest day is to make the program fit nicely into a week and be easily accessible for people with less spare time. Back to back days  skipping rest days not fine. Even if your muscles feel great your bones and connective tissue are taking a battering and take much longer months to adjust to the increased exercise. Ck not only gives beginners a clear plan to follow but also a safe limit on how far a beginner can run each week without risking injury.Sure some people can be lucky and run more frequently without injury. But skipping rest days is going to increase the risk and an injury could set you back months. Once you finish the program you can start thinking about running four times a week then increasing to five and so on. But be patient! Youll get there and hopefully in one piece too.,C25K,cy6riaq,3,t5_2rgoq

6847267,0,t3_49iwwx,What kind of shoes do you run in and how old are they?About two years ago I started doing CK and I made it through probably WD and I noticed that my knees felt stiff. Not sore or anything just kinda swollen and stiff. I figured that I was just fat  ish and out of shape and Id be fine once I got used to it. After probably WD or D they hurt. And I could feel that they were swollen like I couldnt squat down without serious pain swollen. I was running in some practically brand new New Balance crosstrainers at the time. I was talking to my dad about it he used to run a lot and he said it was probably my shoes not being proper running shoes. I took a few weeks off for my knees to get better and went out and bought a pair of proper running shoes. After that my knees didnt bother me again and I made it all the way through CK to the third or fourth week of the K trainer before I just got out of the habit. When I started back up  weeks ago I was fine until I felt the same stiffness in my knees after week . I immediately ordered new running shoes and started using them once they came and my knees are fine now.Sorry for the wall of text but proper shoes make a huge difference. If you havent ever done it and if you have one go to a local running store and have them fit you. They usually know what they are doing and will not fit shoes just to your feet but to how you run. It seems like such a small non thing but it makes a huge difference.,C25K,d0sg0gu,1,t5_2rgoq
6971909,0,t1_d1686eh,Heyho! Just to pop in also for udundermifflintho theres nothing fundamentally wrong with heel striking running on your heels and plenty of long distance runners do so safely and injury free. Moreover if you deliberately try to force yourself into a midfoot strike rather than a toe strike youre hugely risking injury because youre making your body do something unnatural and theres no guarantee what youre trying to do is any better.I am a little worried about the suggestion that Jogging should be more like skipping not like walking and completely disagree...I havent looked at any of the videos but if youd like to try and improve form the easy things to change as a beginner are trying to run more lightly and trying to increase your cadence steps per minute without increasing your speed. These will naturally in turn change the other flaws in your form e.g. higher cadence prevents over striding.Running lightly try running barefoot for m or so or try running slowly in your shoes with as little noise as possible. Think about how you run like this in comparison to running with your shoes. When out running take note that runners passing you are usually very quiet but sometimes youll hear the thump thump thump of their approaching footsteps. Those loud steps are jarring and adding to the impactstress of each step.Increasing cadence run for a minute and count how many steps you take which is usually around  ish but varies a lot. Now try and increase it. A good cadence to aim for is  steps per minute. Its difficult to increase cadence whilst running as many people just speed up instead of taking smaller faster steps so you can try hitting  steps whilst running on the spot and slowly move off the spot when you hit the right cadence.,C25K,d16lq39,6,t5_2rgoq

Id say not overdoing it on any individual run is a good idea  start with shorter runs every day then increase your distance on single runs keeping singe days shorter for example if  milesday is your typical pace start increasing every other day to  miles before moving to  miles every day.,C25K,d1xigrs,2,t5_2rgoq

7461872,0,t3_4hei9p,Congratulations! For anyone concerned about WD it is a long time for sure in comparison to the previous runs. However there are ways to make it easier. In addition to the ones mentioned you can try running different places. Some people say running on a treadmill is easier but for me running outside is so much better. I struggled a lot with running WD on a treadmill despite taking lots of advice and now that I run outside each run is a breeze. Try changing it up like this. Also its ok to do it over again. If you feel you really cant do it anymore and you cant jog any slower you can always try again another day! Best of luck!,C25K,d2qda7a,2,t5_2rgoq

8276579,0,t3_4stcqc,For many people it can take about  weeks to start to see real weight loss not just daily fluctuations. Especially if you start hard unaccustomed exercise your muscles will endure microtears and other injuries that your body will patch with water. Yes you will retain more water the more you exercise at first. Once your body gets used to the exercise and you drink a LOT MORE water to keep from being dehydratedretaining fluid water weight will drop off and you will start to see the fat loss too.Remember fat weighs very little and water weighs a lot. A ml bottle weighs . kg about a pound. A full bladder holds about ml nearly a pound in itself. It took me about  months to start seeing trackable graphable weight loss but after that it just kept going down and down and down. In the last year Ive lost  lbs which is  of my body weight. Stay consistent and drink more water and dont forget about your rest days. Theyre there for a reason. I had exceptional success by changing my diet slightlyHave your biggest meal of the day as early as you decide to eat. Eat your pasta pizza two fried eggs on toast curry whatever for breakfast. You  have that mass of calories to burn all day long. Eat a light lunch then for dinner have the lightest meal of the day. Soup and salad a bowl of Cheerios etc. Dont go to bed with a belly full of carbs.,C25K,d5c4q66,3,t5_2rgoq

8883030,0,t1_d7fb19p,upastau gives good advice.This is my sixth time through the program and today should be the day that I finish. On all previous attempts I usually gave up around weeks  or . Definitely never made it past the two minute blocks in week . Im also about  lbs lighter this time than I was for all of my previous attempts so that helps too. So just listen to your body repeats daysweeks as necessary take your rest time longer than a day if thats what works for you  I need at least two and slow down for the longer runs. Youll nail this. ,C25K,d7fm4mw,2,t5_2rgoq

8991171,0,t3_53dqlb,I think a lot of the great feeling at the end of my runs comes from the satisfaction of pushing myself through the pard parts and coming out on the other side.For me the first part of a run just kinda sucks. Ive heard that the runners high kicks in around  minutes so that may explain why you feel great on the other side. I ran my first  minutes nonstop this past week and I was very pleasantly surprised that at around  minutes I started feeling great and I could have continued when that interval was done.Im trying to accept that the first part sucks  if I accept I dont have to beat myself up for having the negative ugh I hate this thoughts. Ive kind of given myself permission to stop running turn around and go back home if it really really sucks. I havent done that yet. That gets me out the door on days when its disgustingly hot or Im tired or Im coming down with something. And it keeps me running long enough to get to the good part. I also try to just notice as my body works out the kinks... ooowww my glutes are tight. I wonder if theyll loosen up after a few minutes. Ill have to make sure I stretch them out. Hm wheres the next achy place going to be?There are probably some mindfulness exercises that can work here. Simple stuff like noticing the scenery how the wind feels on my face consciously relaxing my shoulders etc.And of course distraction is always an option  losing myself in one of my favorite songs thinking about my route etc.,C25K,d7slmd9,3,t5_2rgoq

Theres no should when it comes to pace. You need to feel that the pace is comfortable you shouldnt be very out of breath and you should be able to carry on a conversation.

11489327,0,t3_63vjpn,As a somewhatoverweight man who hadnt willingly done any exercise in his life  now I found that sticking to the plan weekbyweek has gotten me fitter faster than I could have imagined. I considered doing some weeks twice myself but now Im glad I didnt.As long as you dont have joint pain while youre runningwalking you should be fine. Give the program a go with the intention do do every week once and if you really feel like youre struggling then maybe repeat the last session once or twice until you feel more comfortable with it.I got my shoes from a running store. They put me on a treadmill and recorded how I landed on my feet  the recommended I got corrective soles to fix my running stance. This was pretty expensive though!  though I got mine for half of that due to some health insurance perks I had at the time.,C25K,dfybb48,3,t5_2rgoq

11768139,0,t3_67v9sm,I love running in the morning but have had a hard time getting up lately so Ive recently switched to night runs. Theyre definitely different not necessarily in a bad way. I just have to make sure I go long enough after I eat running with food in my stomach makes me kind of nauseous. ,C25K,dgty6mh,2,t5_2rgoq
