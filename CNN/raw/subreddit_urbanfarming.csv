6665307,0,t1_d08plbp,The air prune is my question. If you will humor me. I have    quart bins that I will use as my trays. I will be growing lettuce with  inch rock wool cubes suspended over it.Now I want to fill the first container then gravity feed the second. Ill put a slightly bigger res as the bottom then repeate. Would this air prune the roots to be just in the cube or would the humidity and wet cube be ok.Im not sure yet how long a cycle would take. Otherwise I need a twice as big res and two sets of pumps.My goal is to have  tiers of lettuce in the most efficient and effective system I can build. Thank you do much for the help so far.,urbanfarming,d08r0yz,1,t5_2s1zh
