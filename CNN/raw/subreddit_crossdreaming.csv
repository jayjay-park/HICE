285586,0,t1_cfa7neh,gt People that have chosen to transition or who want to transition need to believe that there is a core being of sexuality they are aligning to. If they are just fetishist it kills the innocence rightness of their choice.So these are people who would identify themselves as homosexual transsexuals that bristle at the thought that someone might try to categorize them as an autogynephilic transsexual if they dont meet the stereotypes of a homosexual transsexual?gt People that do not want to transition or feel great affinity to their male lives fear the oppositethat this might be some fundamental aspect of their being that will grow and become undeniable destroying the lives and happiness. They need to believe that this is a fetish that can be controlled or at least managed.And these are the opposite who identify themselves as autogynephilic transsexuals who want to stay that way in a separate category from people who would actually want to transition all the way?  This makes sense.  But my question to uiyzie and you is  if we strip away the stereotypes and just allow everyone to categorize themselves  would this take away the controversy?  Say sex reassignment operations were cheap easy and reliable.  Thus everyone is allowed to make their own choice regarding the operation and doctors dont have to make the decision using their judgment.  So if everyone who identifies as a homosexual transsexual chooses an operation and everyone who identifies as a autogynephilic transsexual doesnt is this fine?  Or is there a group of homosexual transsexuals that would say that No they would all choose sex reassignment in a truly free world?,crossdreaming,cfad5my,3,t5_2vvjz
647212,0,t1_cgdr1b7,I end up transitioning because it was somehow very easy for me. I realize that while some part is nice but overall it put me in worse position. I didnt regret that though I take it as life lesson. Ironically I wouldnt be convinced that transition is not that magical if I didnt try it.          You dont have to tell everyone that I get turned on by imagining myself as a girl I dont think it will benefit much. You should be open and tell it to your partner though.       If you are still like woman like me maybe you can start learn to enjoy sex with them. I too have conditioned myself through porn and frequent masturbation over most of my lifetime no wonder normal sex with woman is not exciting at all.          ,crossdreaming,cgdu6rn,2,t5_2vvjz
1844708,0,t1_ckbgels,Problem being that the phenomenology of sexual arousal by the idea of being woman leading to the ETLE and the terms autogynephilia amp crossdreaming all fail to grasp or adequately represent the fetish. What I see as represented most clearest as a masochistic emasculation fetish,crossdreaming,ckbhel9,-3,t5_2vvjz

2754564,0,t1_cnh33h5,But you imply it all the time. You react to the idea that this is a fetish like a homophobe who just got called gay. Lindsayfem and some of your other lackeys just say it outright see above.,crossdreaming,cnh6khs,0,t5_2vvjz

2764467,0,t1_cni6d5w,gtBut reflecting to a natural part of ones psyche doesnt mean transsexualism.Could it be true that Jack is close to acknowledging the social construction of gender identity for which there is no given way which abstract biological conditions may figure within whether at all? By extension even acknowledging sexually mediated affiliations as a condition for such identification?,crossdreaming,cnib4u3,2,t5_2vvjz
2776821,0,t1_cnjosju,gtYou are refusing to deal with the points I made. Address them.And just because I might as well explain the obvious further... forced feminization isnt masochistic either it is an escape from the guilt of their desiresgtyou are just abstracting a theme on part of a fetish which is constituted by sexual arousal by the association of oneself to symbols of emasculation.My understanding   Common examples        Some opinions from MEFs           Your argument was addressed and I am still awaiting your response to the message containing the links,crossdreaming,cnjpqwu,1,t5_2vvjz

5149997,0,t3_3li1ch,Well i know exactly how you feel i used to have Trans and homosexual OCD..I also thought that if i ever turn trans id want to stop living my life.. But thrle good news is that whatever you honestly feel now is all its going to be.. Youd know if you were in denial and you wouldnt enjoy it you would feel happy being a woman but you arent.. I know you are not trans but trying to repress these sexual fantasies does more harm than good.. Trust me you wont become something. The only thing you should treat is your OCD with exposure therapy..  I know you can both be a typical guy you always were but having these fantasies to enjoy on the side im like that now and overcame my OCD and fears which werent true..,crossdreaming,cv6ro1w,1,t5_2vvjz

6877155,0,t1_d0vs06w,Great thank you. It is nice to have a name for how I feel. Im relieved to know there are other people out there that have the same experiences. I love both parts of my identity and each one enriches my understanding of the other. I would like to improve my makeup skills a bit so that the disconnect between my internal image of how I look and what I see in the mirror is reduced and I would love to be more confident in allowing parts of my female side to show. ,crossdreaming,d0vu7rz,1,t5_2vvjz
7174947,0,t3_4dpwdv,Not a weird situation at all and you shouldnt feel strange.  To the extent that crossing is fetishbased there is typically intense arousal just thinking about it.  Actually doing something can be even more arousing.  Some men accept this and enjoy it they modify themselves a bit become very aroused and then its over and life goes back to normal.  Other men would rather mitigate the immediate arousal and enjoy more of the crossing activity.  Some look forward to eventual sexual release rom their activity.  Others deny themselves release to prolong the feelings.  And still others just engage in crossing activity to relax arousal and intense sexual feelings are not part of the equation.,crossdreaming,d1tq3zt,3,t5_2vvjz
7478265,0,t3_4hq84k,The Matrix movies were made by two siblings who later came out as trans women both of them and in hindsight it is easy to see that the triology can be interpreted in a transgender setting.Admittedly the Matrix was more of a dystopia and AI was not used as a tool of transgender liberation but the films did depict a universe where virtual reality was indistinguishable from real life.Stranger things have happened and I have no doubts that VR as it becomes more immersive and realistic will  open up new rooms for transgender and genderqueer people  rooms we can use to explore our dreams and identities.Our real bodies will still play an important role though at least if our feelings are  as I believe  grounded in our bodies and not merely mental constructs. Still I would love to have the possibility to explore such alternative universes.,crossdreaming,d2s8i08,3,t5_2vvjz
9005632,0,t1_d7ub348,Transition is the only option for those who possess this set of sexual fantasies to truly feel lifes fulfillment. Good luck in  years still trying to convince yourself that youre a man.,crossdreaming,d7uc4jk,1,t5_2vvjz
