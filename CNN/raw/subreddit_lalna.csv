4984948,0,t3_3iyig6,I probably missed the most important one of all for the assembled pcbs that are made with the transistors and capacitors and etching acid that are a pain to make can be made by hammering a logic processor from applied energistics that requires  gold ingot  redstone and  silicon it is sooo much easier to make them that way. Im pretty sure gold and redstone isnt a problem but silicon can be made from hammering sky stone or sand in a sag mill.,lalna,cumvcnf,3,t5_2x1px

10328540,0,t1_dcehjgw,The few seeds got them  ender pearls. Unless they start mass producing enderium  ender pearls lasts for a long time. They also had  more ender lily seeds in a chest though Im not sure if Lewis smelted those too. If the did its  more pearls. And apparently its fairly easy to get more of the seeds in the loot bags that drop from mobs.Now that they have a bunch of ender pearls the can get the magical crops for ender pearls which Sjin has already been working for. Unlike ender lily seeds those can be planted on crop sticks so they can quickly get more seeds andor crossbreed them to .,lalna,dcesqea,4,t5_2x1px
