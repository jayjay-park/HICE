9885,0,t1_cef462k,Im not OP but I live in sweden. These types of breads are all made with roughly the same recipe called vetebrd wheat bread the specific variant posted by OP is a vetelngd wheat length which can have different types of fillings and toppings. Basically the same recipe is used for Swedish kanelbullar cinnamon buns. The topping should be prlsocker pearl sugarnib sugar which is chunky I think you can get this at ikea and the almonds seem to be more popular in America my mom also did this than they are here in Sweden.Translated recipe from here  gram buttermargarine . liter  milk  gram fresh yeast in Sweden you can buy yeast for both normal and sweet bread at the supermarket get the sweet kind . cups  sugar this is an annoying conversion youll probably be fine with . cups of sugar . teaspoon salt  teaspoon ground cardamom   . liter wheat flour  gmakes  lengths or around  small buns. Melt the butter in a pan add the milk and warm it to  degrees celcius . degrees F human body temperature.. In a bowl break apart the yeast. Add some of the milkbutter and dissolve the yeast. Add the rest of the milkbutter salt and cardamom . Add the flour keeping a small amount for dusting the work surface later. Knead the dough around  minutes in a machine or  minutes by hand until it is smooth.. Cover the dough and let it rise for  minutes.. Knead the dough on a floured surface. Divide it into  parts.. At this point you can make rolls clipped lengths or braids like OPs mom.To make buns mix your filling roll each part of the dough out into a bit rectangle spread the filling over most of the rectangle leaving a border. Roll it up. Divide it into around  evenlysized buns. Let these rise under a cloth for  minutes. To make lengths divide the parts into  or  parts roll these out into long snakes then braid them. Let these rise  minutes under a cloth.To make clipped lengths make a roll as with buns then cut notches into the roll alternately pulling each chunk to the left or the right. Let rise  minutes under a cloth.Preheat the oven to C  F for buns OR C  F for lengths.. Brush the buns with milk or an egg wash then add the toppings pearl sugar almonds whatever.. Bake! Until golden! and not doughy!Buns  minutes  CF. Lengths this wasnt in the recipe so this is an estimate  minutes  CFClipped lengths  minutes  CFLet cool under a cloth. eat those mofos,Breadit,cefk6ye,2,t5_2s8h0

78128,0,t3_1uzz7a,Here is a close up shot with some butter... though clotted cream might have been more enjoyable Wish I had some.  I followed the RECIPE from Deb at Smitten Kitchen.  I really like a lot of the recipes she posts worth checking out that site if you have a few minutes to spare.It was pretty different than the Irish soda bread my grandmother taught me.  Rather than making a dough this is more like pouring a batter into the skillet.  It came out really good though.  A little more moist and less flaky than a non skillet recipe.  I am still letting it cool all the way down I will update about how it is once cool. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to try an extremely easy soda bread... no kneading and basically no mess at all.Very hard to mess this one up.Compared to my normal version of soda bread.EDIT Recipe I used from linked sitegtSkillet Irish Soda Bread gtgtgtYield  inch loaf.gtgtButter for greasing pan plus  cup unsalted butter meltedgt cups allpurpose flourgt cup sugargt tablespoon baking powdergt  teaspoons saltgt teaspoon baking sodagt  cups buttermilkgt eggs well beatengt  cups raisins or currantsgt tablespoon caraway seedsgtgtgt.

Add wet ingredients to dry and stir until just combined. Do not overmix. Stir in the raisins gtor currants and caraway seeds.gtgt. Pour batter into skillet. Brush top with remaining butter.

199860,0,t3_1we7tc,First of all whole wheat berries are perishable. The germ has fat which will go rancid if left out too long put them and anything made from them in the freezer. Next there are several choices of what to do with it. Traditional whole wheat flour is just those wheat berries milled special word for grinding grains to equal sized pieces to a flour consistency. The whole wheat flour on the shelves in stores has the germ removed so it keeps longer but yours will not  keep in the freezer please. White flour is just traditional whole wheat flour but sifted. There are all kinds of specialized sieves and screens to remove the husk and germ of the wheat berries leaving just white flour from the rest of the grain. Sprouted Grains make for a sweet tasty snack. This is exactly what gets done to barley for making beer and whiskey. The grain naturally converts its starches to sugar to feed the sprout which is then stopped from growing leaving you with a sweet grain to play with. Find a jar or other container you can top with cheesecloth and a rubber band. Soak the grains overnight in water then drain them completely. Three times a day breakfast dinner and before bed rinse the grains with water and drain completely making sure no grains just sit in water but all got wet. Do this for  days until the sprout is as long as the grain itself. Then bake in a F oven until lightly golden. You now have sweet sprouted grains! Sprouted Whole Wheat Flour is milled sprouted grains. Whiter flour can be made by sifting this whole wheat flour. Soakers are where whole crushed andor milled grains are soaked in water overnight to ensure full saturationhydration. They are then drained of any excess water and added to a dough for extra texture nutrition and flavor. Personally I only use  whole grain flour out of  total flour rest made up with white bread flour for standard loaf recipes. ,Breadit,cf17flw,2,t5_2s8h0

Yeah cast iron is a brick of metal to be sure... but one accidental thermal shock or dropping it on the wrong surface and youll crack it. Glass is great holds up well and doesnt corrode... but one slip while washing and it could be over. Steel can warp if you arent careful and does have the possibility of rust although that is usually less if you actually use it because the oils and such tend to seal any pores.I have some of each.

1996319,0,t1_cktkavk,I put my dough in the refrigerator immediately after mixing where it stays for a day or two.  It rises but not very much.  The yeast slows down but all the while it releases enzymes and acids into the dough resulting in fantastic flavor that cannot be found otherwise. I take it out a few hours before baking. Not much happens in the first hour the dough is still pretty cold but I do give it a stretch and fold.  By the end of the next hour it rises almost as much as it would had it not been refrigerated.   I turn it out onto my bench divide and preshape and let it rest for twenty minutes or so.  After that its just a matter of shaping and proofing and then into the oven.No one complains about having to eat my bread.  No one.  While this sounds like I do a great job all I really do is mix and shape.  Time and temperature does the real work.  Yeast does have a life cycle.  It does die.  The trick is to get it into the oven right before it does so it still has enough energy for oven spring.,Breadit,cktr9cp,2,t5_2s8h0

If you are proofing in a warmed environment it happens much quicker but in the fallwinter especially proofing at room temp it will take quite a while to overproof it unless your starter is extremely active.

2870024,0,t1_cnu7qg1,Hey congrats on your first noknead bread it looks pretty good!A few things  Try to use recipes that specify weights instead of volumes.  This will make your breads more repeatable and easier to troubleshoot since a cup of flour can vary quite a lot depending on how tightly packed it is how humid it is etc.  Your recipe states  hours.  How many hours did you give it?  The optimum temperature for your water is going to depend on how long you want to leave the bread rising.   Your recipe has no proofsecond rise after shaping.  Did you omit that or did you go straight from the bulk rise to the oven?  A proof step would definitely help with a more even and open crumb.   Its good to store yeast in the fridge just make sure its kept tight and dont leave it outside the fridge too long now as that could cause condensationmoisture to build up in the jar which will greatly reduce its life.  you can get more holes in the bread by letting it rise slower so adding colder water or keeping it in a cooler place adding more water but its hard to tell if this is advisable when youre measuring by volume and handling it more gently during shaping to preserve as many gas pockets as possible.  ,Breadit,cnubmfs,12,t5_2s8h0

2965540,0,t3_2u54sc,My recipe was derived from here but I did make a few adjustments. I used AP flour because its all I had and I used  cup of flour. I messed up the water conversion and did roughly  mL of water. I also used  tsp instant yeast  tsp honey  tsp salt and then added about  tsp sugar because the honey was all solidified. I baked it at roughly F until I realized my conversion was wrong so then down to roughly F for around  minutes total. I ate most of it!Cons Tasted too salty and it absorbed some flavour from the wooden cutting board I had it onPros no knead quick rise from ingredients to table in . hours. UPDATE I had some today and honestly tasted almost better! I stored it in the fridge overnight. Still nice and soft. Im sold definitely making it again. ,Breadit,co57430,3,t5_2s8h0
2966369,0,t3_2u5fhn,So I made my first loaf of Tartine bread a few weeks ago and it was delicious. However my husband made the comment that he liked my noknead bread almost as much and for way less effort. We both wondered if the Tartine was so much better as to be worth the extra effort and just how much of Tartines appeal was in the baking technique and loaf shaping. So I set out to do a sidebyside comparison.I made the Tartine bread according to the instructions in the book. My starter is a little bit over a month old and I made the leaven on Sunday night. Did the bulk rising and flipping on Monday stored the loaves in the banneton in the refrigerator over night and baked them on Tuesday. The noknead bread was the basic loaf. I mixed the dough on Sunday night right after I started my leaven and then stored it in the refrigerator after it fell. I baked it on Tuesday after both Tartine loaves were finished. I baked the loaves using the exact same technique taught in Tartine. I used the cast iron dutch oven preheated at F use the same scoring technique immediately lowered the oven temp to F. After  minutes I removed the top of the dutch oven and baked for  more minutes. At this time I thought the no knead was too pale for my likings so I put it back in for another  minutes. At this time the loaf was still pale but the top was almost burnt so I took it out of the oven at this time.The resultIn appearance the Tartine loaf is much nicer. It has wonderful blistering and a more uniform caramel color. The smell of the Tartine loaf was incredible. Smells almost like it had a parmesan crust. Very cheesy. The noknead bread smelled well bready. Nothing too special with the smell.The taste of the Tartine loaf was complex. The crust has a slightly sour almost beer like flavor while the crumb has a complex cheese like flavor. I could have eaten the bread alone without any toppings. The taste of the Noknead loaf was good as well. But not as complex and more one note.  The texture of the Tartine was a nice crisp crust and chewy interior while the texture of the Noknead was more cakey.The conclusionWhen baked the same way the Tartine is far superior to the NoKnead in my opinion. The bread is stand alone. However I think the noknead version would hold up better to being made into a sandwich.Second conclusionThe this is not the best way to bake the Noknead loaf. I usually make smaller dinner sized rolls and bake on a baking stone with the steam tray below. When I bake the noknead this way the texture is closer to the Tartine bread. Also when left to sour in the fridge for a few extra days the taste is more complex however decidedly more sour as opposed to the cheesy goodness of the Tartine.,Breadit,co5ai7w,9,t5_2s8h0

I decided to warm the milk to C before mixing with dried yeast.Finally I used agave instead of honey only because the honey I had left crystallised and I didnt want to heat it up and risk hurting the dough. As a result the bread probably wasnt as sweet as Id expected but thats probably for the best.After prepping dough I got impatient. So I split it and cooked a batch instantly. The photo is from the second bake next day giving it about hrs of resting. Resting for longer ultimately allowed for the dough to be shaped easier and the bubbles in the bread were finer.All in all worth the wait!,Breadit,coet776,5,t5_2s8h0

3616351,0,t3_31rlou,When I read through the recipe I did not think that the recommended fermentation first rise duration was long enough. Of course everything depends on how warm or cool the room is where your dough is rising. Cool temperatures will enable a much longer rising period. Cool temperatures can also mean that the recommended rise duration is insufficient. On the other hand if your room is warmer than the recipe envisions then the recommended rising duration might be too long. It is all trial and error.Through experience you will learn what is that puffy quality of the dough that means the dough is ready to proceed from a first rise to the next step. I never go by volume recommendations such as the dough must double or triple but by the shape and puffiness of a dough. Keep going observe your doughs and enjoy all the good breads you make. The worst that can happen is you get some crappy breads.,Breadit,cq4hnj2,1,t5_2s8h0

3667657,0,t3_32dx3n,Based on the recipe I found online calling for the proof to be a boule on a flat table your most obvious sign of over proofing will be the dough having lost all tension and being completely flat. It may be hard to work with but still definitely worth baking if it is flat I would even consider folding it on itself. The dough may still end up flat if your gluten didnt fully develop or was overdeveloped. Also depending on the vigor of your starter going in or the temp of that counter you are proofing on chances are  hour would have been too short of a proof anyway. Either way I think you should bake it and enjoy some fresh bread! ,Breadit,cqac60k,4,t5_2s8h0

3908273,0,t1_cr1p2ht,The sourness can be adjusted based on how long its been since youve fed your starter its hydration level and how active it is. Since its a new starter you may need another week until it is up and running. Using different flours can affect the taste of your starter too. Many people add in some whole wheat flour during feedings. Since each starter is a unique culture of microorganisms it may takes some experimenting to find the variables to produce the flavor you want. Youll have a larger hole structure with a higher hydration . The dough is more difficult to work with as you add more water though requiring different techniques. Peter Reinhard shows a method of doing that in his book under the ciabatta section. ,Breadit,cr1s0n7,1,t5_2s8h0

4279339,0,t3_39xebn,When I first started baking bread I would have tasty tasty bricks so I get where youre coming from.  Its a bit hard to help without the recipe you were using but heres what I did to improve my bread Make sure youre kneading it for long enough you need to develop the gluten to give it enough strength to rise and set during the bake.  If youre kneading completely by hand try for around  minutes or longer depends on the type of bread play around on google. Try and use a high gluten or bakers flour this often has a higher gluten content than cake flour we have a product called bread improver which is added to cake flour to strengthen it. There are some really great no knead doughs out there a lot of them use a sponge to start things off.  This is a mixture of flour sugar salt water and yeast which you mix and leave to rest for a while before mixing through the remainder of the flour and leaving to rest again.  I have a particularly good one for french bread which I almost have to pour onto the tray or into the baking form. Be patient make sure youre leaving time for your bread to prove and develop.  Make sure to preheat your oven completely before putting your bread in play around with temperatures and times  we always used to bake our bread at c for  minutes but now more commonly do cc for  minutes the french bread we do in our steambake oven at c for  minutes.  As you play around more you will get more of a feel for it.Have fun and good luck ,Breadit,cs8012x,2,t5_2s8h0

When dough is resisting what you are doing  it means the gluten needs time to relax.  When I do pizza I cut the dough form a ball. Wait  minutes or so.  Press the dough by using finger tips. Start at center and slowly keep pressing down not out in concentric circles !dont use a rolling pin until it starts resisting. Then I give it  minutes to relax and start pressing it out again.  Also dont press the dough out onto flour. Make the dough the right size and then drop it into your ban with corn meal.  If your dough sticks to the surface when you are pressing it out use a bench knife to scrape it off the surface. ,Breadit,ctv8lu9,1,t5_2s8h0

5157823,0,t3_3l4zt0,The yeast in the bread will deteriorate when frozen. It will be fine for a couple of days but much longer than that it starts to die from the cold. When you go to proof or bake it it doesnt do its job as well and less so as days wear on. This is why bakeries add a freezer conditioner additive to their bread mixes when they are going to freeze the dough for any extended length of time. Even then the stay in the freezer is not extended endlessly it might add two or three days for decent decent proofingoven spring. Beyond that the yeast again takes a serious nosedive.You would freeze the dough after its bulk proofing and final shaping but before final proofing. This at least gives the yeast  that is about to take a bit of a hit  a head start when you later let the frozen dough thaw and finish proofing. In a large bakery setting you would likely also go for a flashfreezing which is freezing extra quickly needs specialized freezer unit.One of these conditioners is called IBIS Blue from LeSaffre another is Frostec from Puratos. Theyre not generally available for regular consumers. But these and other brands are used widely in the industry where yeasted products are destined to be frozen for more than  days. Use is about . to  of the total flour weight.What if you dont want to use or cant get conditioners but still want to freeze your bread for more than  days? Theres a very easy solution and the results are quite acceptable.Youre much better off baking  even parbaking  the loaves and freezing after theyve cooled off completely. Reheat in a F oven for about  minutes and they should be pretty much as good as new. The result is a loaf where the yeast has already done its job giving proof and oven spring and the baking has pretty much set the starch strands. You can then easily freeze the finished bread for quite a long time barring any frost damage. Just be sure to wrap the  cooled loaves very well before freezing.Parbaking is basically just getting the loaves to a nice midgolden colour from what youd normally fully bake them to or about  done and then finishing the bake after their freezer vacation. In that case you may need to add a few more minutes to the nd bake time.Bonus point when rebaking you can serve the bread warm from the oven since the starch strands were able to fully cool and set after the first bake.,Breadit,cv7pki2,2,t5_2s8h0

6313649,0,t1_cz75zt9,I disagree about adding the salt beforehand.  All the recipes Ive seen and used autolyze with flour and water only.When I make this loaf I start the autolyze at the same time I get my leaven going.  I get both going first thing in the morning.  By midafternoon Ive passed my float test so I mix the dough up and do the SampF thing over four hours.  Shape it rest it  minutes final shape then into the fridge overnight.  Next morning preheat oven with D.O. inside for  minutes or so get dough out of fridge score it and bake.,Breadit,cz7aine,1,t5_2s8h0
6332144,0,t1_cz9cwvy,I agree with all of your points. Id also suggest to OP that oil comes in handy when forming your strands. You want the dough to be a little tacky as it will be with suitable hydration and instead of using flour to manage stickiness coat your work surface and hands with a film of oil. Go light at first... you want just enough to keep the dough from sticking too much and everything will slide around and its hard to roll the strands out to shape. ,Breadit,cz9e8rt,1,t5_2s8h0

6523981,0,t1_czu0osi,unfortunately you are wrong about the rules of kashrut. this article youve linked is specifically about a bread being marked as kosher even if it has dairy in it. As the article states at the beginning any bread that is dairy is not kosher according to the talmud. However as the article goes on there are two leniencies. One it states outright if its shaped in a peculiar fashion its ok. The second it doesnt state outright which is if its a small amount  the article refers to this when it mentions the second leniency. The bitul bsishim concept mentioned therefore in this case applies to the prohibition that a bread with dairy in it be marked as kosher at all not to whether it counts as dairy.As you can read hereone may not intentionally put dairy into meat likewise dairy into bread.youre pretentious and rude. i guess calling yourself an ass makes that ok??,Breadit,czu4qpq,3,t5_2s8h0

They eventually become so saturated that they burst and liquefy. As the bread continues to cook this starch gel turns into a brittle and glossy shell. The more moisture there is on the surface of the dough the more abundant the starch gel and the crisper and more crackly the eventual crust.,Breadit,d0sizhh,1,t5_2s8h0

7243954,0,t1_d21kp32,sorry for your difficulties buddy. Would need to know more details about your process to know whats going wrong. At first I had issues with my starter then it kinda just fell into place. You only need to feed it daily while its getting kicked off first week or so after that when the volume doubles over a few hours it goes in the fridge and you pull it out two days before you are going to bake with it two feedings should get it up to the volume you need. Thats the way to conserve flower. However I keep two cultures in the fridge I like backups and feed both only once per week and then back into the fridge. I will say that if you keep one living on the fridge it will require about min of labor a day to keep it going well. I keep two on the fridge for no reason at all. ,Breadit,d21l2ps,2,t5_2s8h0

7382793,0,t3_4gbzbd,Are you using a kitchen scale when you discard and feed? If you are using volumetric measurements you are going to end up with a more wet consistency. Using a kitchen scale may help balance the consistency out. With the Tartine method you wont see your starter double. It really only grows about . If it is producing a layer of water it either means that you are incorporating too much water which is separating or that the yeast is starving and is releasing alcohol. Unless you live in a place that has been quite warm recently I imagine that it is the first case. Did you start the starter with some portion of whole wheat flour? And are you using it to feed it as well? The bran in the whole wheat flour has more yeast and bacteria in it that you want to cultivate compared to white flour. Maybe try feeding it  whole wheat flour if you have it available instead of the  blend that the book recommends to see if it helps. You dont need to throw out your starter. If anything that will just set you back to square one and take more time to develop. Best of luck.,Breadit,d2hdgh7,3,t5_2s8h0

7603919,0,t3_4jgs38,There are different ways to do it. Most people pick a schedule around what is convenient for them. I keep my starter out and feed it every  hour hours if I am just maintaining it not baking and get it on a cycle or two of  hour feedings if I am going to bake. Ive gone as long as  hours between maintenance feeding and it was fine but I wouldnt go any longer than that.You can keep as little or as much as you need depending on how much you plan on using. Most people maintain their starter at a  or  percent hydration. This means  part starter to  part water to  part flour. For example I keep my starter at g because I use the discard for other things like waffles etc. So that would be g starter to g water to g flour.I never use straight starter when I make bread there are recipes that call for it but for bread I almost always do a preferment like a tartine style as I find the straight starter recipes get too dense probably a bad description but I just dont like the way they handle or turn out but thats just a personal preference.If you want to keep it in the fridge feed it put in in the fridge. After a week or less take it out let it get to room temp and feed it as normal. I usually do at least two feeding before I put it back but again thats just personal preference.Also baking with starter is a very long process. There arent a lot of Im going to do a loaf real quick tonight recipes with starter only. The quickest I have ever done it was a  hour bulk and  hour proof and that was in a very warm environment.

If you dont stitch and just round with this kinda dough then its not going to keep itself standing up tall. The narrowness of my loaf was just because it was in a narrow shaped basket.

8568428,0,t3_4x3uyx,Ive been baking bread for a couple of months without really using any recipes besides what my mum taught me when I was younger and what seemed right. My standard bread uses about dl of water and dl of flour. Total time including rising and time in oven is about  hours. Can definitely be less if you are very efficient but I prefer not to stress.Ingredients  Flour white rye whole wheat whatever you like. I like a mix of  whole wheat and white. The higher the quality flour the better the bread will be typically. Ive used dirt cheap store brand flour and it works just fine. Higher quality flour does make better bread though  Water  Salt this isnt inherently required I just like it as salt generally brings out flavour  Yeast I use dry yeast as I cant find any live yeast in my local supermarkets. Both work fine but prep vary marginally read below  Oil I use vegetable oil aka rapeseed oil but olive oil works just as well. This isnt required either but it makes the consistency of the dough better  Seeds or anything you think would taste nice in the bread. I like using poppy seeds sesame seeds sunflower seeds andor pumpkin seeds. These arent required and I dont always use them as they can be kinda pricey. And since I sometimes fuck up the bread thats money wasted.Prep  Heat water to just about body temperature C if you dip your finger into the water itll be like you cant really feel the water. Dont spend too much time perfecting it most of the time itll be just fine if its a little hotter or colder. If you use dry yeast you can heat it up a bit more about C. If you use live yeast dont heat above around C as it may potentially kill the yeast. Add yeast and salt. About  teaspoons of dry yeast per dl of water. A generous pinch or two of salt per dl of water.  Add flour to water. I dont use a bread machine Im broke also I like kneading so this makes things a lot easier. Youll want about  more flour than water. For example if you do  units of water do about  units of flour.  Stir the flour into the water so that you have no clumps. I just use a fork and my hands once the dough is getting a bit sturdy.  Add about a teaspoon or two cl of oil at some point. I usually add it when Im halfway done with the flour as the oil easily mixes with the liquidybutnotwatery dough. At this point you can also add your seeds or other goodies if youve got any.  The dough is ready for kneading once it doesnt stick to your hand when you hold it. This doesnt mean its completely dry it simply means that no dough sticks to you when you knead it about. In my experience the wetter the dough is the bigger crust youll get. Ive got no idea about this though as I always cook at the same temperature with roughly the same ingredients.  Time to knead a bit! Literally just push the dough over itself over and over. You kind of push it down then fold it over and push down again and repeat. Its kind of hard to explain via text. The purpose of it is to remove air bubbles from the dough so its not unusual to hear some faint wet popping sounds coming from the dough  its totally normal. Im sure kneading is good for the consistency of the dough and stuff but Im not really sure. Either way make sure to knead well. You should be kneading for about min. If ever you feel as if the dough is too wet ie it sticks to you just add more flour as you see fit until it no longer sticks or is at a desirable dryness. Now youll want to put your dough in your bowl that you were mixing in to let it rise. Cover the bowl ever so lightly with flour to prevent the dough from sticking to the bowl when it rises. Also sprinkle some flour on the dough itself so its not sticky when you take it out of the bowl after rising. Now cover the bowl with a teatowel or similar preferably a tiny bit wet so that it stays on nicely. Make sure the towel is straight over the bowl and not slumping into the bowl. This prevents it from touching the dough. Also make sure there are no opening into the bowl make sure its airtight. This creates the correct condition for the yeast to do its magic. Now leave your dough to rise for about an hour. Preferably in a warmer room as yeast prefers heat. Dont bother heating up a room or placing it ontop of a heater conditions dont have to be perfect. Once the dough has risen for an hour or so doesnt matter if its longer really take it out and knead it once again. I like sprinkling some flour on a table top and kneading it on there. Youll want to knead for another  or so minutes. Once youve finished kneading youll want to shape your dough. You can make little buns  dl of water makes about  buns or simply a bread shape. Round or oval or square or whatever you desire. I usually make it a typical bread shape thats thicker in the middle and narrows out towards two sides. Its up to you though. Youll want to have an oven preheated this doesnt matter too much just makes timing more exact to about C or gas mark . Stick the dough on an oven plate that is either very lightly oiled up or has parchment paper on it. This prevents the dough from sticking to the plate. I go with oil because I cant find any parchment paper locally. Doesnt really make a difference at all. The amount of oil should be very small. Youll just want to spread it super thin and thatll be enough for the dough not to stick. Now leave the bread in the middle of the oven for about min. In the beginning I was really afraid of burning my bread but its just practice really. Youll learn when the bread is starting to get ready. Different flour looks different when cooked as well. If youre feeling a bit paranoid looking at your bread simply stick a knife or something similar into the bottom of the bread reaching into the centre. Pull the knife back out and if its wet andor has dough on it that means the bread isnt cooked on the inside yet. Once the bread is finished take it out the oven and let it restcool under teatowels. I can almost never resist cutting a slice and eating it with a bit of butter whilst its hot but ideally you should let it cool down before eating all too much of it. This is by no means the perfect bread nor is it the easiest I imagine its just what I bake every so often because its easy cheap fun and relaxing for me to do. Im always looking to improve the consistency of the bread and the crust so if anyone has any tips feel free to tell me! Happy baking TLDR Mix ingredients bake bread enjoy!

My wood rolling pin wasnt really doing the job I switched to my marble rolling pin which worked great except flour doesnt stick to it so I had to flour the tops of the tortillas as I rolled them out.I fried them in a nonstick crepe pan that looked exactly like the pan the lady in the video was using. Took a few attempts of different heat levels etc... before I got the process down pat. Out of  tortillas st was way too thick and undercooked nd was still way too thick and I burnt it rd was great and  were perfect.I probably overfloured them when I rolled them out and they turned out a bit dusty as a result  had to wipe them off afterwards with a damp cloth.Went with this recipe for the tacos themselves.

Then Id remove the tip and lower your heat to  and bake till its browned nice on the outside. I normally go for another  min. You can check the timing with a thermometer.

10927770,0,t1_de6yk1x,There are a couple of schools of thought about yeast and proofing. Yes the original goal of a proof is to prove the yeast. My bread is never over proofed. But as I mention my bread is heavy dense disgusting inedible if I skip the proof step even in the bread machine. Im not the only one. I got this trick from many other sources online when I was researching bread machine recipes as well as from my years of making by hand. Which brings us to the other school of thought on proofing wake it up and start it going with warmth moisture and sugar. I know my yeast works but the process has the same name. My machine might have the same problem that the one OP has. I also didnt imply that OP would have access to the same kind of flour I only listed it so there would be context.,Breadit,de74fli,2,t5_2s8h0
10974157,0,t3_5woee5,Ive broken two in the last couple of weeks. Stones dont like any moisture at high temps. Rapid expansion will kill them. Go with one of the metal baking steels or if youre in a fix an inverted baking sheet. That is what I plan on doing for this weekends baking sessions since I already have large baking sheets at the ready.The links cast iron stone looks interesting. Id be interested to see how it would do. Id imagine it would work out pretty well. My only concern would be the quality of the casting. Modern cast iron tends to be pretty rough which can be hell for smoothly removing anything from them.,Breadit,debxjlh,1,t5_2s8h0

11347483,0,t3_61y104,From the look of that grill tray you I am curious if you are working with a small oven?  The heat doesnt look so even and the top is burnt which makes me think you are doing it in a quite small piece of equipment.I recommend you score the bread top in a cross or try hache marks or three scores. it may help keep the bread a little more level on top and prevent scorching by leveling the top of the bread as it expands.You can experiment with the shape of the bread a bit as well to better suit your oven conditions.,Breadit,dfi7t8v,3,t5_2s8h0
11387905,0,t3_62g4sj,If the temperature is too cool in my apartment I just use your method  but dont leave the dough uncovered. That will create an undesirable crust that forms on the dough as you mentioned which can inhibit rising and it can mess up the texture of the bread. I simply oil the top of my dough with oil or nonstick spray then cover it with plastic wrap. This will keep the dough moist and prevent it from drying out. The plastic wrap over the oiled dough also wont stick to your dough like a towel sometimes can. But a damp towel works decently well too though in my experience plastic wrap works best. ,Breadit,dfmst9d,2,t5_2s8h0

11563485,0,t1_dg5v8pf,I make these crackers! I like them. In general however Ive never really understood the throwaway spent starter thing. Maybe Im breaking the rules but I never throw away any of my starter. I usually store it in the fridge and Ill feed it when I remember to...but that can be a week sometimes as I travel a lot.When I do need it Ill pull it out stir in the liquid and feed it. Sometimes Ill then use some of it in bread right then...or sometimes Ill let it warm up and get bubbly then feed it again and then use some for bread. If I use it right away i will typically essentially feed it again as part of the bread making process...so add more water and flour in equal parts and let it sit for awhile sometimes overnight but ultimately just use in some bread. If a recipe calls for fed starter either scenario results in fed starter. If a recipe calls for spent starter like the crackers then I dont even wait. More often I dont use a recipe and Im just making bread and do some math to get my hydration level where I want it.I know Ive let my starter sit in the fridge for even two perhaps three weeks without a feeding and its fine. When it has sat that long I do have to wait longer for it to get happy enough for bread or at least wait longer for it to ferment and rise etc...but I still see no times when Id throw some out?Do all of you throw away starter? Seems like a waste? Have I broken some cardinal rule?,Breadit,dg6q5dl,1,t5_2s8h0
11580700,0,t3_658nsv,Looks better than my first sourdough did. Id agree you need more gluten development  try a long retarded rise overnight in the fridge say.
