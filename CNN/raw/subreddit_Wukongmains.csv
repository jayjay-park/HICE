6440993,0,t1_czlit35,So is red smite better than blue most of the time? For the redsmite damage you have to auto them a few times right?,Wukongmains,czljd51,1,t5_38u07

6922168,0,t1_d0v0go7,If he freeze try to bait his e or let him auto once or twice so wave pushes for sure. If you have  cs till your lvl u will still beat him for sure! Trust me ,Wukongmains,d10y9sq,1,t5_38u07
7141794,0,t3_4cgqn0,The Q nerf makes it even more important that you max Q after E so you get that juicy  percent armor reduction! maxing w second was viable before the Q nerf when u had the max percent at level .,Wukongmains,d1py248,1,t5_38u07

8902423,0,t1_d7hmolb,Better than your lane opponent yes. If you have them that far behind they arent your target in fights. Youll be targeting the people from other lanes that have more gold because they were farming.,Wukongmains,d7hxypl,1,t5_38u07
9151293,0,t1_d8bdph4,True but in lane E auto Q is faster and more reliable the point here is to take as little damage as possinle and thats what this combo accomplishes if you W after or go into a bush,Wukongmains,d8bzqzp,2,t5_38u07
9157919,0,t3_55oo3a,Can you please just chill with all the videos. I want the sub to be more active but not like this. May lord Allorim save me along with his guardian angel zeus.,Wukongmains,d8cu0gw,1,t5_38u07

10067839,0,t3_5jfaak,Love it monkeys count an Auto Attack as high AD Scaling. of your AD is the scaling of the Q Spell.That you do  of your AD is called AA and Even Soraka has it.Garen has a  AD Scaling of his Q btw.E Bonus AD  is not even that high. And his Ult Dmg Scales with his Base AD Same with Q.He has    lvl . You can go Steraks and increase the Damage.He is doing  AoE dmg lvl  as BasedmgYou guys buy  AD to deal  more dmg in his E.Oh the Stronk AD Scalings on his Auto Attacks! xdCuz you are Auto Attacking that much while Ulting right?Like its not Easy to buy  Gold armor and fuck your True dmg bullshiat right.You guys cant deal with tanks or Bruiser just cuz u decided to build glasscanon and waste a huge Part of his Kit for killing squishys which you also could do with a tanky style and would be a bigger Trade.Full AD Wu wanna kill my adc as Janna?Peel here Wu die Instant Free LP.,Wukongmains,dbjv24q,1,t5_38u07
10374932,0,t3_5ojyzo,I use Jade because its still the skin where the decoy looks the closest to the original.,Wukongmains,dck27rp,2,t5_38u07
10380846,0,t1_dcfty3r,Pretty much none of the ways to check will work if he does it in a bush tho,Wukongmains,dckqeir,1,t5_38u07
10643882,0,t3_5r7w32,Whats your typical build path?,Wukongmains,dddu289,1,t5_38u07
11749311,0,t3_67mu0z,I actually feel hes fairly decent in the jungle moreso than other positions.  I really only find sustain an issue on the second clear.  Ganking with red is fine pre  if you have a good opportunity outside of that just farm unless you have hunters and a good opportunity but I find his pre  ganks lack quite a bit but his counter ganks just from sheer damage tend to be really strong.  I really build no sustain outside of the dual charge pot.  ,Wukongmains,dgrtb0u,2,t5_38u07
