8406719,0,t1_d5sbyif,Ahhh this is a great idea! I love kitchen gadgets that actually do their job WELL and really save you timeenergydishes while cooking.Ill join in and recommend THIS or probably any similar microwave steamer.Its perfect for vegetables or pretty much anything you want to cook quickly with minimal washing up  just pour some hot water in the base chuck your broccoli in and pop the lid on then throw it in the microwave for a few minutes.Takes a minimal sloshing in soapy water then rinsing to clean it all off. I dont think I could function without it now  cook my veggies this way almost every day.Found it but with massively overpriced shipping on Amazon.com if youre interested just go for the best rated microwave steamer you can find for a better price.,TeamSunflower,d5sdvvz,2,t5_3f9m8
