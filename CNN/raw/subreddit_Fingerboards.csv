10514981,0,t1_dczwll8,Hello and welcome to rfingerboards! I see youre questioning the legitimacy of our community.You dont look too much like a troll based on your comment history so Ill give you a genuine answer. Of course this is a legitimate subreddit! Theres a subreddit for everything my dude. Were all human beings and were into different stuff. We happen to like hanging out and playing with miniature skateboards whats the big deal? Call it childish call it sad call it anything you want. This has been a hobby for me since I was way younger and I dont intend to stop any time soon. Stop by WalMart or target and buy yourself a tech deck for  bucks see if you have any fun with it. It looks like youre into boardgames why is us being into fingerboards any more sad or lame than that?I hope that youll reconsider your opinion but youre welcome to think whatever youd like. It just seems sort of like a dumb waste of time to comment your hate for a small group of people that share a common interest. ,Fingerboards,dczzhrh,5,t5_2so6q

10800514,0,t1_ddtz0mn,I realize making a living. If you spent years learning something you would think to be inclined to share your wisdom. By not sharing it you arent progressing fingerboarding. You are keeping prices high by reducing supply. I always share everything I learn. I live by open source. Someone wants to know how I did something I show them exactly what I did.  I know its a business thing but when others dont know the basics then nobody will ever improve what they are currently doing. Fingerboarders all over are trying to make boards but they are getting frustrated as it takes as you said  decks to get it right. Yet I can go find an entire manual on disassembling a PC or a dirt bike  that costs twice as much.  Obviously people have this process down and the only reason they are holding onto these secrets is to drive prices or they are selfish.      Check out posts on finding what size screws nuts and other items people are using. Nobody shares what size they are. Why is that? Its to drive the prices up on those niche items. Some of these items are easy to find in bulk and are sold at stupid prices because kids dont know what they are called. Like Teak Tuning. I can literally get a bag of  of those bushings for . Thats . a set of bushings and people are selling them for over  on some sites. Just like the screws. BR wants  for  screws. Thats ridiculous you can get  for around .  The only thing that was actually legitimately expensive in bulk are the locknuts. I cant find any US vendors charging less then . for a single one. A  locknut at the hardware store costs around .. KathyFBS actually lowered her prices once I started posting about this on Instagram and FingerboardHQ.  I know this is somewhat ranting but its such a niche hobby and all the secrets out there are getting ridiculous. I also am a part of RC Airplane groups and they share everything they know. Ive never been a part of such a niche group that tries to hide as much as possible. Its just odd.,Fingerboards,ddtzvfv,1,t5_2so6q
