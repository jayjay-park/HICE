1130088,0,t1_chwn5w0,Thanks Ill check it out I dont mind which specific firmware it is as long as it is one of the alternative linux ones they are always so much better than the stock junk. At least the alternative firmware have consistent interfaces !,DDWRT,chwqtb2,1,t5_2tfws
1279275,0,t1_cidizx0,Yup. Use Insidder and check what channels the other wireless networks are on.Pick the least crowded channel. Set it in the router. From there check signal quality again.The routers autointelligent picking of the leastused channels tend to suck but I digress. Try that and see if that does anything. If not boost the wifi signal via the wifi screen I think it was.If that doesnt help Ill provide you with my wireless setup and see if that helps ya.,DDWRT,cidjai2,1,t5_2tfws

1739114,0,t1_cjyacah,Well I can tell that it is not your DIR or main router. Go google about enable file sharing. If Wireless client bridge works and you can ping all devices within same subnet then it is not the routers fault. ,DDWRT,cjydntz,1,t5_2tfws

5730646,0,t1_cx6xv6o,Then in that case I cant really help you much other than suggesting you look at the Buffalo webpage for your router. There should be firmware there that you can just flash from the web GUI.,DDWRT,cx7fxzm,1,t5_2tfws

7779104,0,t3_4kdvyc,The command looks fine.   How did you determine that eth was the wan interface? After youve entered the command what does iptables t mangle list show? Can you try swapping ttlset  with ttlinc ?  Any difference?,DDWRT,d3qf4gf,1,t5_2tfws
9117490,0,t3_550ips,Well first thing to troubleshoot would be to hardline directly to the modem.  What speeds do you get then?,DDWRT,d87rwdq,1,t5_2tfws
9358544,0,t1_d91w234,Actually he has a point. If Access Restrictions is blocking by DNS name then SSL has nothing to do with it.,DDWRT,d929h8v,2,t5_2tfws

10432905,0,t1_dcqmd9e,Ay this is not good. I flashed the old firmware back and I still cant connect to the internet anywhere. I am in over my head but do you know why it didnt work even with a direct connection to the modem?,DDWRT,dcqn0rt,1,t5_2tfws
11541436,0,t1_dg3fig2,Thanks for the input Im buying this because someones selling it to me dirt cheap. USB . would have been great but I cant really afford a new router thats as good as the c with usb . support. Beggars cant be choosers eh! Besides specificationwise it is more than capable of handling the easy peasy load ill be putting on it. ,DDWRT,dg48215,2,t5_2tfws
