1627339,0,t3_2cxzw5,Season two was just as good as season one in my opinion. I found it to be consistent and seamless across the two. Ive actually never heard anyone like season one and dislike season two. My only thought is if it was mislabeled and youre talking about season three.Have you already seen the end of the World Medafighter Championship? If so this is season three which is terrible.If not it is season two. It does become less daily hijinx and more Space Medafighter X but I personally like both. If you didnt like the start I expect youll enjoy the middle episodes where the hijinx pick up again but dislike the end where it gets back to more HikaruHenry stuff.,Medabot,cjkahnp,3,t5_2uj92
