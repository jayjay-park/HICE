4565494,0,t1_ct56g6c,gtDeescalation seemed to be the main objective of the officer until he heard that the driver had a weapon in the vehicle.What? He seems to try harder to deescalate after hes told of the weapon. He keeps assuring him he isnt going to jail etc etc. Before that he was slightly more lecturing him.,GunFights,ct63fgx,1,t5_2y6nx
5585586,1,t1_cwpfs5m,gt Just himself.and  guys to take the gunmans shots if he were to return fireit was not just his fate he was deciding it was everyone around him and especially the guys between him and the gunman. the two unarmed guys had greater odds of ending up dead because this guy fucked up the engagementI would have no problem with this if he just gambled with his own life and made himself deaf,GunFights,cwpfzks,0,t5_2y6nx

7610355,0,t1_d37935r,Sometimes I find it to be like justiceporn in a sense.For example I just watched a video earlier today in rStreetFights  about a road rage incident where a guy got jumped by two other dudes after he kicked in their headlights. The lone guy was being a total dickbag and probably deserved a pounding but because the guys jumped him v I was internally pissed off. I kept hoping that guy would go to his truck and pull out a gun it was texas.Anyway.. yeah. So I came here looking for gunfights to fill my craving and found its been over a month since the last post.,GunFights,d379auh,3,t5_2y6nx

8446679,0,t1_d5xcx4a,definitely however your supposition of perspective from the arm chair is incorrect granted having no knowledge of someone elses experience. IMO the officer started yanking the trigger very low. Bottom line LE came out of it without holes so its good.I hold myself to a higher standard as now being a civie daily carry that in my mind transfers to those who carry as part of the job.Shitty location for a shoot anyway..,GunFights,d5xdexw,-9,t5_2y6nx

8946511,0,t1_d7n6tye,Dude the officer had a taser out he didnt fire his own gun. The other officer clearly shot with a silvercolored gun. They asked him for A LONG time to put down the knife unfortunately it came to the crazy rushing the other officer with the knife. Its really just simple deduction man. I wouldve done the same thing.EDIT To clarify it takes less than  seconds for someone to charge you down from over  feet with a knife. We learned this in academy a while back.,GunFights,d7n8lmb,17,t5_2y6nx

10120700,1,t1_dbq17xq,This guy isnt wrong. Basic firearms training includes knowing what your bullet will hit in the event it passes through your target. Obviously you should minimize the risk and while this officer couldve done that it means giving less time for the accused to cooperate. So he made a call. Im also gonna guess hes using hollow points so the risk of the bullet passing through the target is highly minimized. Thats probably why he didnt seem as concerned. Now if he had a fmj then the bullet wouldve hit the people behind the target.Dont shit on this guy for being correct. The cop didnt do anything wrong but there are factors that can be incorporated to make the situation safer for bystanders.,GunFights,dbqqgc9,0,t5_2y6nx
10192335,0,t3_5ly8r5,The officer that you see run for cover in the beginning was shot in the face and arm and the second officer the one diving through a display and sliding on his ass while shooting like an action movie hero was hit in the upper vest. The suspect was hit in his everything and did the honorable thing and died. ,GunFights,dbzcvt2,59,t5_2y6nx

10379667,0,t1_dc98psa,I know your comment was old but I just wanted to say that there didnt seem to be any cover. There were just a few people using their buddies as cover maybe he just didnt want to do that and just hoped he wouldnt get killed.,GunFights,dckll60,2,t5_2y6nx
10422923,0,t1_dcp9fxy,I can understand not wanting to touch him if you dont have training due to fear of making it worse but when there were  officers on scene you would think one would know first aid.Maybe there wasnt much bleeding and not much that could be done. Maybe they thought the fire guys would be there sooner.Not condemning the officers just saying if i ever get injured around emergency services I hope i dont get left that long.,GunFights,dcpia3g,1,t5_2y6nx

11727786,0,t1_dgmeif4,Yeah learn a thing or two.  Like if you shoot someone in the leg they dont always live.  Shooting someone in the head doesnt always kill them.The lesson to learn is to assume that any gunshot is fatal so dont shoot unless its life or death.  And if its life or death protect the officers life over the life of the guy with a knife yelling Allah Snackbar.,GunFights,dgpdig6,0,t5_2y6nx
