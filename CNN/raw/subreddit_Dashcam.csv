736708,0,t3_22ljpz,Batteries esp Chinese ones do not last long and create heat. So they will last no longer then a cap at best after time. The extra heat can also cause reliability issues. My dash camera will run the battery down if its left plugged into a all the time powered outlet. So not sure how much if any better the newer ones are for that. My new truck has a ignition based outlet so its nice I get in and the camera turns on with the truck and maybe a minute after I turn the truck off. The GW looks to be a great bang for the buck. I would probably get the Cap version myself. The GTW is a newer camera that has optional GPS in your price range. More than double the GW but has some extra features. Still kinda new so check out for user reviews.,Dashcam,cgo0n1s,2,t5_2ties

1599102,0,t3_2clg2j,the gw is cheap but ok. personally i would recommend the gwc version over the gwh. pretty sure the gwh is just the same as the original but with a stealth black design. i posted a video few days ago still on the front page of rdashcam about using black spray paint to make the gwc more stealthy. it has a capacitor which is preferable in a dash cam since its less likely to die like a battery and wont have issues getting hot in your car when your car is sitting out in the sun. if you want to go cheap you are better off just getting two cheap dash cams but you will also need two memory cards then. the gw models all can be set to turn off the screen after  minutes and a few higher settings that seem pointless. but if you really want cheap and no screen the mobius is very popular. ,Dashcam,cjgqhzh,2,t5_2ties

4749167,0,t3_3fxpa9,Hey uemergencyhammer. I know you want a camera that will do both but if you want to do a crosscountry timelapse of your drive an action camera with a timelapse mode GoPro is far far better suited to do this versus recording everything on a dash cam and having  hours worth of footage to speed up. The quality will be much better on a GoPro style camera as well. Heres an example that someone else did on a GoPro that looks really really good. They do hold their value well I wouldnt be surprised if you were able to buy a used one on Amazon and just resell it after your trip.Otherwise our Drivewatch G will hold large size memory cards GB formatted in the camera will work that will hold a ton of footage. The camera records in P using a Sony sensor and allglass lens so the video quality is very good. The audio quality is also good recording funny conversations in the car will work well but isnt as high quality as what you would get with any kind of professional camera  microphone setup. I mount mine exactly as you described and it disappears behind the mirror  I cant even see it from the drivers seat.

9297176,0,t3_57p1n9,Sounds like you are looking for a dual camera setup correct?  If that is the case Im not sure how easy it will be to simply remove the cameras each night.  Tinted rear window will be a challenge for any cam as well depending on how dark it is.  Since you really only interested in day video then maybe it wont be too bad.  The only dual camera I currently carry is the Transcend  but I dont think thats what your looking for.  You could buy  As . each.  One for the front and one for the back.  Since its a standard cab truck it would probably be simple to reach behind you to remove the back camera.  While I sell extra GPS mounts I currently do not sell extra standard mounts.  Something Ill look into carrying though in the future.  Extra GPS mounts are  and make removing the camera a little easier since you wont need to remove the power cable.  However if you plan is to take the power cable cigarette adapter and USB cable with you from truck to truck then the standard mounts might serve you better.  Youd just leave the power cable connected to the camera when you remove it.Lots of info I know.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

10268045,0,t1_dc7wcj7,Several manufacturers I have talked to said the novatek processors are not good at doing the motion detection all the time. The concern is that it could skip recording while you are driving. Many also have a big delay between sensing motion and recording. maybe they have gotten better now but when I tested the mobius and gw motion detection it always missed a good  seconds between the motion detection and recording. once i tried my mobius in my bedroom i walked in walked to my dresser got something out walked out but it missed ALL of it because the delay in recording from the time it sensed motion was so slow. even to this day street guardian doesnt recommend driving around with the motion detection on at all times with the novatek chipsets like the SGGC. the SGZCRC has buffered motion detection and they do say you can use that with motion detection at all times with no worries. Maybe you can do it and not have problems but when the actual manufacturers arent recommending it it doesnt fill me with confidence. edit i just saw in the manual for the a it says not to use motion detection while driving because it may not always record so yea not even recommended by viofo. ,Dashcam,dc7xtge,1,t5_2ties

11289023,0,t3_613ua7,There are many more factors than just quality for price in deciding which dashcam is going to adorn your windshield and Ill tell you before you ask that I do have the Viofo AS and the Xiaomi Yi dashcams.If it was just quality for price the Xiaomi Yi wins hands down. Just look at what you are getting for  a beautiful elegantlooking camera with many of its functions preprogrammed.  It has  menu items while the AS has a whopping !It has builtin WiFi for Christs sake for  as well as A.D.A.S. which is usually reserved for highend units even though it is not used very much due to the fact that there are a lot of falsepositive warnings. Some of those at be caused by operator error because the camera has not been calibrated precisely.It has a screen which a lot of buyers appreciate and when the screen saver goes off as programmed it turns into a very handy digital clock if you want it to.The crme de la crme of course is the video I.Q. and for  you get stunning super high definition video image quality at a resolution of  x  at  fps.  So the question for me is very simple to answer but as I said there is more to take into consideration than just the quality for price.  Theres the formfactor the fact that it has a batterylots of others do too the fact that it comes in  colours that some people are not crazy about even though it is very easy make all black.

11485175,0,t1_dfxcl85,If you try a new card try a  or  GB and make sure its formatted for fatHeres guide to dashcam formatting and a toolIf you try another sd card thats class  and not SanDisk and its freshly formatted and the cam still fails Id reach out to the vendor on Amazon and ask if you can have it swapped out. Explain that you used x SD cards and the format tool and tried to format in the cam and it still is having artifact issues. Class  cards should save fast enough to not artifact. Older slower cards can have issues tho. But keep experimenting and trying and Im sure youll sort it out! As the other user said try to plug power into the side of the cam instead of the GPS mount too. Good lucky,Dashcam,dfxucor,3,t5_2ties

11645200,0,t3_666k53,This is my dashcam footage from a few years ago. The footage starts just after I left one highway and got onto another highway. It put me in the fast lane of the other highway. While I was looking to move over into the middle lane a car comes up and matched my speed. I thought he was intentionally blocking me so I slowed down. He goes on up ahead slows down and straddles the fast and middle lane. Then goes into the fast lane and stops.  I thought he was messing with me. Waiting for me to pass in order to follow me. I didnt want to take any chances so I slowed down and let others in the other lanes pass.  I then finally got up to where he was and made a break for it.  After that the video is just me rounding the bend and pulling over to call the cops as I thought he was still stopped in the middle of the highway boring stuff.,Dashcam,dgfzwr0,1,t5_2ties

11711872,0,t1_dgnjtkx,The alternator powers the lights. The battery only provides power if the car isnt running. It also provides power to the starter motor to start the car. If the car is running the alternator is charging the battery and running all the electrical components.,Dashcam,dgnkjds,5,t5_2ties
11756494,0,t3_67liia,Have you tried a different memory card? Plenty of cameras exhibit unusual behaviour when they have a faulty memory card inserted.Some people advise that you should format your memory card once a month. ,Dashcam,dgsmmky,2,t5_2ties
11806004,0,t3_68g4qs,Ive done this a long time ago. But I wouldnt recommend it.Itll be a pain in the ass sorting through all sorts of hours of video showing nothing at all to find what you want. Instead buy a buffered parking mode camera.Meaning if it detects motion or g sensors it records  or  seconds before the motion and  to  seconds after. This is standard on most Korean made parking mode cams.You can get a parking mode cam from thinkview for  bux with average video. Or for  lukas qvia ar wd is full p Sony CMOS front and back wifi apps for your phone and has low voltage detection built into the software so you set at what voltage it turns off and dont ruin your battery.Make sure to read up on low voltage cut off so you dont kill your car battery too if you set up an always on parking mode camMost people use whats called a fuse tap to hard wire. if you have a fuse box in your cabin thats the easiest way. If you dont then Ive also simply tapped the cig lighter or bought an aftermarket hardness for the radio and spliced to that so I didnt have to cut factory wiring. Make sure you add a fuse to the circuit.As for discrete google how to pull an A pillar and simply run the wires down the a pillar behind the glove box and where possible tuck it into the headliner.Nothing wrong with running multiple cams but a cam with an actual parking mode will use less power and prolong the life of your battery as well as make the SD card last longer by not burning through it. I was lucky to get even a year out of a p cam recording nonstop. It usually lasted just over  months before Id have to replace it and would corrupt the file system every week or so from the nonstop writing not to mention the over heating and rebooting.Buffered parking mode cameras are popular for a reason. If you have need to record something nonstop consider an IP cam in your houses window instead.Check out what thinkview Lukasqvia Blackvue and vicovation have to offer in parking mode cams,Dashcam,dgy923e,5,t5_2ties
