8190814,0,t1_d51cgew,The first few episodes start a bit slow but they are important for introducing all the characters and locations. There is so much going on that things would get quite confusing if those episodes didnt thoroughly introduce everything. Once it picks up it stays awesome from what Ive seen so far. Its a very intricate story so you need to get through a lot of details in order for it to be told properly.,patientwatchers,d51eiy7,1,t5_2t3jm
