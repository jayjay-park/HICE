Though some of them are placed in such a way that its almost impossible to get away from them.The trick thing i notice all the time. I find that the timing to do tricks is very fiddly and really makes this game frustrating. Sometimes i get it perfectly for a few times in a row but normally i dont even manage to start a trick properly.One thing I do find annoying is the not enough height thing for tricks. Yeah okay im not always super high above the ground but some times i can fly for  seconds just m above the ground and to have the start of the jump just say not enough height is really annoying because it blocks you from doing tricks.,Steep,da6d30e,1,t5_335x1

9690474,0,t3_5duw15,One of my friends had a somewhat simlar rant. Damage as you call it is the amount of Gforce that is applied to your character. You can describe gforce as how much your character is exposed to earths gravitational pull gravity. This means that regardless of how perfect you land a jump gravity will push you into the ground and your character will be exposed to a force. The strength of the force depends on two things The height of the jump.And The angle of the slope you land on.Which means you either need to know how steep of an angle your landing will be OR you need to slow down so you dont go flying as high. Plus if you dont fly as high you might have enough breathing room to land an extra jump.As for the jumping. Some ramps are easier to time than others. This is an open world with countless of ramps and obstacles which means that some are just not meant to be jumped. Some may have an awkward kick and some may have an extremely flat landing.Although I do agree with you regarding the constant damage on rocks thats just retartded.Lastly sorry for any grammatical mistakes Im a simple swede.EDIT typos and linebreaking.,Steep,da7k12m,2,t5_335x1

I missed the  minute mark before and now I really wanted to beat it. I noticed someone putting flags up and figured out how to do it. I then spent about  minutes flagging different paths and trying them out to beat solomons challenge. It changed the game for me. There are so many things to do it just takes a little searching and an open mind.

You can either forward the ports which takes  minutes and only has to be done once get a router with automatic port forwarding set up a DMZ or install custom firmware to your router which will allow said feature.Theres a much more detailed explaination on Wikipedia here and a laymans version here Please understand,Steep,dbi4dh8,1,t5_335x1

10756867,0,t3_5dz76u,I know this might have been mentioned but the thing that would make this game a larger community for me would be to implement a slope editor and have the ability to customize runs with jumps and other stuff.

11088157,0,t1_denwjou,I feel like part of the challenge of the Alps compared to most of Alaska is actually momentum conservation.  There are a number of different areaschallenges in the Alps where landing badly or falling can lead to you losing enough speed that finishing the rest is very difficult or even impossible.  In Alaska thats a lot more rare since more often than not its steep enough that you pick speed back up super fast.There are certainly parts that feel like bunny hills but I also see conserving momentum as an interesting challenge in some areas of the Alps.,Steep,deotzta,2,t5_335x1

11213204,0,t3_600v6e,IMO it is completely better than Shaun White snowboarding. More content and much more freedom of play. You can spend all day finding new lines and riding how you want to. Never played an extreme sports game like I really. The closest I can come is the Skate games. But even so this is much much larger in terms of scale. I havent had this much fun with a snowsports game since Transworld Snowboarding on the Original Xbox. Ssx tricky and the xbox  version was fun but I never got too much into those as the arcade style wasnt my favorite. Still fun though. Definitely recommend for anyone who has ever been on a slope on their life. You will love it. Or for those who have an appreciation for all things winter. Or those who enjoy plummeting off cliffs to a certain death whilst back flipping merrily. ,Steep,df3054i,2,t5_335x1

11272558,0,t1_df9e5la,I actually love the wingsuit challenges so it never seemed that bad to get gold even if it took a while. Completed La Fieruse ? yesterday and it took a while to get gold but I kept playing it anyway bc once I got it it felt awesome to play.The freestyle challenges feel grindy sometimes because the trick system isnt the best and wipeouts seem to be out of your control at times. I do like the races tho.,Steep,df9q7tx,3,t5_335x1
