295606,0,t1_cfbehcb,Yeah there is. Society by the way is also a byproduct of genetics. EVERYTHING is genetic. Were nothing more than sacs of muscle bone and flesh designed to pass down our genes. Society everything we made and have is a byproduct of what our genes have evolved to make us capable of doing.and if those posts threatened her mental health enough shed just stop posting those pics. she obviously is confident enough in herself that it doesnt matter. Maybe you should take a page from her on that.,bullying,cfbelv8,1,t5_2sw9l

Thats how I think of bullies and theirs targets. If they are targeting you they already know you are weak neurologically. You can tell if you are weak at the brain level and if you have been pushed too far in the subordinate direction if when you are bullied the following things happen.  you get mad or frustrated  you get tight or amped up. If you have either of these things happen to you then you are not in a condition to defend yourself verbally or physically. If you try to defend yourself verbally you will either freeze up or if you do argue will quickly get amped up and explode. If you try to defend yourself physically you will be vulnerable to being framed as the aggressor. Bulllies at least in my case work together as a group. If there is one person after you there are likely many. They coordinate with each other to keep the subordinates repressed. In my experience they like it when someone is prone to fight back because they can work together to change the narrative and make it look like it is you that is being the aggressor. If there are many of them then even if you beat one another and another will take their place. You are then left as the common factor and therefore you must be the problem.Also I imagine but dont know that if you fight when you are amped up it probably strengthens the connections in the various adaptations in the brain and all of those nasty adaptations will get strengthened.If you ignore the bully your brain treats it as a victory slowly easing back those adaptations and moving your neurological profile more towards someone of higher rank. You become less angry your brain gets less excited when you get challenged etc. Then after you do this for a long time you can being to challenge your aggressors but I suggest you do this verbally not physically although I wouldnt go so far as to suggest you can never fight or use any form of physicality when you are in these situations.,bullying,cqmp1tm,1,t5_2sw9l
