My experience with bubbaed used shotguns is the stock has been messed with as well as the barrel and maybe magtube but the receiver will likely be untouched.Some salespeople will try to tell you the gun is worth more because of the modificationsdamage but some will know its worthless and sell it to you for whatever they can get.A month ago I bought a Mossberg  this way someone took a hacksaw to the barrel that was well used and abused to begin with and threw on a cheap tacticool pistol grip stock.  The receiver and internals were in good shape though.  I made them a low ball offer and they were just happy to get it off their gun rack.,Gunsforsale,clcnxie,4,t5_2sdvv

2308321,0,t3_2lpme5,Its a Colt Trooper III if you were not already in the know. It is a  inch not an  inch. It is nickle plated with optional target trigger and target hammer. I would not rate it in excellent condition as there seems to be a fair amount of scratches and there is a clear turn ring around the cylinder also there seems to be rust or old caked on oil on the ejector rod in the third picture. It could just be the lighting but there seems to be minor peeling on the cylinder as well. I personally would not rate it any higher than  condition. With all that being said it is still a Colt and Ponies always bring in a good chuck of change. Shorter barrels are usually preferred but this is still a nice gun. Now it is not one of the snake guns that bring in the big bucks so I dont know where you are getting  from. I have bought and sold several of these and never seen them sale for over  unless they were  with box and papers Yes you will see people with higher prices on them but they do not sale. The Trooper MKIII are not real common but they are not as rare as the Python original Trooper or the Trooper V. You have to remember this was basically a poor mans Python so there were fairly common back in the day. If I had to give you a price I would say right around  would be fair but there is always a sucker born every minute so dont be afraid to put the price higher so you can work your way down. It being nickle plated will help it sale so maybe throw on another . Edit I would like to say something about the prices you have seen. I really like the Trooper model as it is a really nice gun and is very rugged and reliable so I keep watch on them on several of the Ebay type sights. The prices you see them listed are not real world prices from my experience. People just assume they can list any Colt . revolver with outrageous prices because they see the Snake guns going for  and up. The problem is the Lawman and Trooper models were not as finally tuned or finished as the Snake guns were. The Trooper and Lawman models were made to compete with the likes of the SampW  and the Ruger Six Series. They were intend to be side arms for the police or to be used for self protectionbeside guns. Now that is not to say they are not nice guns because they are very nice they just are not as refined as the Snake guns are. When Most people buy Pythons now and days they buy them to invest or to collect not to shoot. The TrooperLawman is a Colt . revolver that an everyman can buy to shoot and not feel guilty...Of course I dont own a gun I dont shoot. ,Gunsforsale,clx0wkw,7,t5_2sdvv

Might have to get a different safety selector for the left side of the gun for you to comfortably shoot it for extended periods of time. But those are cheap upgrades.

Its the more difficult part of the conversion. Go to saiga saiga forum or youtube to see examples. It does lower the value extremely compared to a saiga converted to a bulgarianrussian replica.  Awesome guns and possible future collectibles if Trump doesnt overturn Obamas orders rumors say Trump plans on repealing over  because he finds them unconstitutionalAlso youll want to see if there is an adapter to allow it to take ak mags screwed or welded in where the bullet guide is check to see if screw holes from rear conversion are riveted or plastic caps.

If you get friendly enough with the guys who run the place they know the ammo prices are high and they tend to look the other way if you buy a box here and there and bring in your own ammo.  They only allow pistol calibers.  I own a  Hornet and they wont let me shoot it there. No draw and shoots either.
