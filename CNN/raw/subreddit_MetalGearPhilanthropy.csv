I kinda found it funny at the time but now Im a little upset that I lost an S rank staff member that I used because he had a really cool accent and I could use the heavy mask.

As much as Id like to earn the cut scene the day we can move cameras and mines is the day this becomes impossible that change is too much for the masses.

6472060,0,t3_44ajg4,Its a war between Philanthropists and Patriots if you choose a side youll be part of it as for the glory and rewards when the goal is reached. Knowing that yes a Patriot who whants revenge or some personnelresources would probably attack you if they can choose. And you know what? GOOD. First is not easy to find them nowadays and second and on my personal opinion most important each nuke gives the owner hs blockade per nuke. But! if they attack that blockade cooldown dissapears instantly so they could be attacked again which is very good for us.And the most important thing Dont fear to be attacked its the daily struggle between PFs and the beautifulness of this new mode. An enemy base attacks you but not AI a real soldier out there as you can infiltrate its base steal personnel hisher resources or even a nuclear weapon made to put you away from their place. You stand there and take their weapons of mass destruction like you doesnt inmutate of that power. If you want to join Philantropy youll find enemies of course but also a lot of brothers and sisters wholl even defend you from the infiltrators and avenge you if necessary.Good luck soldier!,MetalGearPhilanthropy,czor8vv,3,t5_39x9e
6480461,0,t1_czor8vv,Good explanation. The only thing I would add is that if its your first time ever encountering the person you stole the nuke from they get one free retaliatory invasion without their blockade dropping. After that though its like you said. And even if it is the first time if they get spotted during that free retaliation they will still show up in your retaliation list and stay there for over  days so if you wait for the blockade to lift and theyve developed more nukes youll be able to invade and steal their nukes all over again through your retaliation list without having to wait for them to show up in the nuke tab.Also OP Ive never had an invasion that caused enough damage to my base for me to really give a damn to be honest. The blockade system keeps you from getting griefed in that way. Really the only truly highstakes thing that can be stolen from an FOB is a nuke which obviously isnt something you have to worry about again except for the phantom nuke thing.,MetalGearPhilanthropy,czpmlkz,1,t5_39x9e
