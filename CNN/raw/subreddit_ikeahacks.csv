1586201,0,t1_cjewzn2,Ok awesome! Thx a ton for replying stores like Joann fabric have inexpensive thin foam that would probably work perfect for the arms. Most of the time its half off as well,ikeahacks,cjf425x,1,t5_2she4

7762841,0,t1_d3of5kk,Yeah this definitely is not a good idea at all. I coincidentally bought the same drawers for storing my stuff in you wouldnt want to put consoles in there or youll end up with some nice overheated and unusable ones.,ikeahacks,d3okot0,10,t5_2she4

8458704,0,t3_4vge6v, Top Bottom Bamboo Clear acrylic lacquer Frame Bamboo Filling material Honeycomb structure recycled paper filling ParticleboardThe filling will be a problem because only the premade holes are suitable for attaching legs. Try the Gerton tops instead as theyre made of solid wood. ,ikeahacks,d5yvf96,2,t5_2she4
9210942,0,t1_d8j7omy,Oh dang that sucks. Makes sense I guess as their pricing is absurdly low. ,ikeahacks,d8jk0ga,2,t5_2she4
9406985,0,t3_59h47j,Another option is two Ikea counter tops.  Or if you dont need the depth you can nail the laminate flooring directly to the wall.,ikeahacks,d98eghu,3,t5_2she4
9424325,0,t3_59p9l5,I with their site allowed for searching by size. I was looking for something of a simialr size recently and ended up just looking at each cabinet individually. ,ikeahacks,d9aljjz,2,t5_2she4
9719850,0,t3_5e8dyb,A few years ago we actually had a burlesque dancer come into an ikea with a similar outfit. Hers was a little ostentatious though. Good job on the hack!,ikeahacks,dab6led,2,t5_2she4
9885664,0,t1_datasdk,Yes we got overexcited and posted too soon. As we fill it up will post updates,ikeahacks,daw4izh,1,t5_2she4
10867053,0,t3_5lsazt,Its a nice design but I wouldve altered it so the desk portion could fold down or up and be out of the way when not in use. Give the monitor a dedicated shelf and then put the desk on hinges or folddownup sliders.,ikeahacks,de0uy5e,1,t5_2she4
11297653,0,t1_dfcdmi6,Great! Thanks for the heads up. I was mostly worried the feet wouldnt fit and stay sound. Thanks for the process,ikeahacks,dfcklpp,1,t5_2she4
11695237,0,t3_66epl4,Thanks for all the suggestions! Honestly was a little annoyed at first since I felt proud of what I did and comments were saying to fix it and that itll essentially fall apart but once I got through that it does make sense to go back and shore it up. I think if a few adjustments are made based on everyones suggestions this piece can be better and will hopefully last a while. Ill post back on what comes of this. It seems like a lot of people would be interested if the design was perfected a little more. Before making I searched high and low for this type of minimalist design and found next to nothing except a  bench. Kallax was  and the legs were . The cushion was a bit more...in total the cushion was probably around .  for a full sheet of MDF plenty left over though for other projects and  which was  off at the time for the easy clean wear resistant fabric. The rest went to foam and batting. ,ikeahacks,dglo974,1,t5_2she4

11806310,0,t1_dgya31w,This is a standard german and therefore regulated and tested to death haha extension cord with multiple outlets... So I think Im fine. But thanks for your concern   Quick edit I just googled what a gfci outlet does and in Germany we have central grounding for the whole house  and not for every single outlet. So its a different system as far as I understand. ,ikeahacks,dgyaazz,8,t5_2she4
