6246634,0,t1_cyyyxr9,I am not basing my opinion just on the links I provided but on reading numerous books studies cases etc. Because I do not agree with the opinion that Avery may be innocent is not an indication of improper reading or lack of objectivity.We do not have documented evidence of childhood cruelty to animals by Avery. I dont disagree. There is the recent interview with Jodi where she said he talked about bruning cats at a younger age and her cat being gone because he got rid of it while she was in jail as well as but again that is unverifiable. What we do have is a large amount of research that tells us that Avery fits the profile of someone that would commit the crime he was found guilty of. There are plenty of doctors psychologists veterinarians and those in law enforcement that would disagree with your opinion that the two leaps I made those being he did this or witnessed this as a child resulting in the escalation of the seriousness of his crime are far from far fetched. I suggest reading Veterinary Forensics Animal Cruelty Investigations by Melinda D. Merck Animal Cruelty A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding by Mary P. Brewster and Cassandra Reyes Animal Cruelty Antisocial Behaviour and Aggression More than a Link by Eleonora Gullone and Animal Cruelty Criminology amp Prosecution by Prabhakar Shah. This is a cat specific chapter from the  HSUS public policy series titled Cruelty Toward Cats Changing Perspectives byRandall Lockwood written originally for the ASPCA So no I dont have any smoking guns about his childhood. What I do have is a great deal of support for my opinion that Avery indeed is more than likely the kind of person that would have intentionally or not killed Teresa Halbach.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,cyzoaml,1,t5_3buh7

6677919,0,t3_473sqh,gtI put conspiracy theory in the title for a reason its not based on facts at all. However its also not more speculative than most theories about police planting evidence.The main MAM subreddit foundation is made of those.gtOf course this assumes you believe that SA is guilty and evidence wasnt planted. So he shot her with a rifle probably multiple times yet nobody seemed to hear anything? How loud is a rifle like that?Likely whatever TH was killed in was burned up in the bonfire. There is a  x  bleachgasolinepaint stripper stain in the garage. It was done on Halloween night See BD trial Day  p.. This could include anything from tarp to pillows to whatever muffling could be made with items about the place.gtA few people saw TH arrive. Did none of them notice that she was there a little bit longer than usual? BD did apparently.gtDid nobody wonder that she was there longer than usual that he didnt see her leave and that her car and body later was found on their property? Knowing what type of person SA was?Why would his family complain? They didnt before.gtWhy were they so calm so less surprised when the entire thing unfolded? Calm. In murder investigations an indicator is when someone breaks a routine. SA took his first day off the day after she was killed.gtOh the police found a body in our sonsgrandsonsbrothers burn pit after he had a bonfire and the victims car with his and her blood in it on our junk yard? Im a mushroom and know nothing.Actually BDs mom found bleach stains on his jeans. BD told her he was bleaching the garage with Avery on Halloween night. She told this to LE when they asked about him. Thats what led them to BD. When she found she incriminated her son she took it out on Avery! This wasnt very calm. MAM might make it look so... but not all time remember?gtWouldnt you expect some outrage no matter what they believe? Like climbing on a car roof and screaming at the press? Didnt BDs mom do that?gtIf they believe hes innocent they should be WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?? The simply switched to the oh they want to frame Steven narrative and they did so pretty early.Well you must remember its a documentary propaganda piece. Its edited and filmed in ways to present a face.gtAlso its not your normal family. Making a Murderer says how they are seen as outsiders or misfits but yeah wonder why.. Whats wrong in a family where almost every male member seems to be in conflict with the law on a regular basis including serious assaults and a certain tendency towards sex crimes.I dont think even the guilty believers wouldnt blame society to some degree. It is obvious all sorts of problems exist there. Economic. Population size. Resources. Etc.gtIts not even a conspiracy to say that the mindset regarding law ethics and how to behave was totally off in that family.It wouldnt be a conspiracy. They are a section of demographics when it comes to wealth and location.gtTbh they remind me of one of those creepy incest families in horror movies who live in some village where tourists disappear and nobody knows anything.The funny thing is I suspect MAM makers thought that if they didnt tell us this then if we found out it would somehow impact the innocent view they want to share. In the end it isnt an important factor in terms of his guilt at all. Thats done by looking at the evidence.gtIm pretty sure that it probably was obvious to them what happened but they just stuck to SA and kept their mouth shut. The question is if there was any involvement of other family members. The fact that SA basically invited BD over to rape a girl he captured says something...BD was involved in at least the clean up.gt I wonder if BD is the only family member who would have been on board or just randomly choosenLike you said. Didnt anyone notice? Seems BD did.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d0a1zv5,-1,t5_3buh7
6692526,0,t1_d0bj6pz,Well...yes I agree that the confession is a massive WTF? in terms of Amandas possible involvement. But in her case she was pressured for hours and hours not like Brendan Dasseys minute turnaround Tell the truth gt Ok XYZ happenedtype deal. Plus she was pressured for hours and hours in another language with no interpreter. However good her Italian was shed only been learning it for a couple of years and only been in the country a couple of months. Plus she did come across as naive and a bit ditzyloopy.I think at that point they were trying to get her to hypothesize. I saw another case where after hours of pressure to confess a man said sarcastically If I murdered the girl I did it in my sleep. Based on that confession and one or two pieces of circumstantial evidence that got him in the interrogation room in the first place he was charged and held in custody for  months until his lawyer investigated and found exculpatory evidence. I think cops knew that a black man was involved somehow because DNA testing pointed that way andor I think a witness said they saw a black man leaving. So they tried to work out what black people Knox knew and found her See you later text to her boss. I think shed translated it literally  Ci vediamo piu tardi as opposed to Ci vediamo dopoA dopo so it was police not her who pounced on the Lamumba as suspect idea and encouraged her to include him because they were somewhat racist. And yes Italian police can be racist it is a thing like it is everywhere and including the UK. It seems unlikely that Amanda would have independently fingered her boss as culpable if she knew he was at the bar that night with multiple potential witnesses. I guess the basketball court was just an unlucky guess theres a great This American Life episode on false confession btw  an unlucky person correctly guessed a random specific detail.

6734125,0,t1_d0fefa2,Ok just so Im clear then could you give me some examples of evidence other than DNA that would have been more than suspicion and therefore admissable?The whole paragraph regarding the law suit is all just whatifs and speculation. It very likely would have made SA a multi millionaire within a few years as you say. They were already going through depositions saying they would just have motioned themselves from the court is wishful thinking. And your point about risking themselves is the real misunderstanding. They didnt think they were risking themselves they had the support of the community they were getting rid of this guy for good. As I said the way they did it was just fine for  years! If it wasnt for the doc we wouldnt be having this debate.They had means opportunity and motive. They didnt create the opportunity but they took it.Dress up the Calumet MC charade all you like. Calumet Sheriff Pagel officially quoted that they would be providing equipment ironic and nothing more. Colborn and Lenk the two men DEPOSED for the previous wrongful conviction then were on site the whole time unsupervised and found the damning evidence. It was a big system abusing its power to get rid of one disliked hillbilly. You are clearly doubting that Law enforcers could be corrupt like this do you believe this sort of corruption and wrong doing doesnt happen elsewhere and often? Do you agree that public officials who are elected can often have bias act in a way that furthers their career at the cost of someone else?You went into a lot of detail about the bullet but it boils down to this  you say the evidence is the bullet the cleaned garage and BDs testimony.You concede that there is a huge red flag in point . And really that should be enough for you to disregard its validity. The SAME technician who in  concluded that a hair on Penny Beernstein belonged to SA ruined the control sample leaving nothing for the defense to test and claimed she had a conclusive match to TH. After being told specifically to put TH in the garage. In my opinion red flag isnt the appropriate phrase I would use blatant misconduct. The BD testimony the testimony that you concede has swathes of completely false wildly inaccurate information  yet rely on other sections of the same confession as legitimate evidence. BD doesnt even testify about cleaning blood does he? What else is there apart from thisQ What did that uh  you said it  something to clean up. What did the  what was the something? Do you know? What did it look like?A Looked like some fluid from a car.Q So what did you do to clean up? Or how did you clean up the the mess on the floor?A We used gas paint thinner and bleach with uh old clothes that me and my brothers dont fit in.Q Okay. Well let me ask you was it a  a large spill?A About three feet by three feet.So yes of course it will be corroborated that he had bleach on his jeans by his family  thats not slightly incriminating.Also Luminol is not a magic blood detector. It detects iron and other metals. This is why secondary tests should always be performed to confirm that there is blood present.And if she was shot in the head and created this huge pool of blood..Im sure youve seen the pictures of the garage. How was there no actual blood found in the concrete floor no blood or samples of dna skin tissue anywhere in the wooden boxes other porous materials which would obviously have been touched if someone was shot close range. How can he have shot her in the garage left it a complete mess but left no DNA anywhere? its absurd to me.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d0fv8dl,1,t5_3buh7

He then put his own DNA on it when he hid it.All KK was saying is that even if you believe the key was planted there was still enough other overwhelming evidence to convict. Nothing earth shattering there. He was just addressing the key planting theory as some of the jury may have been duped into thinking it had been planted. There was absolutely no evidence the key had been planted. To not convict just because the key may have been planted would have been a daft decision.What you truthers should be doing is overcoming the insurmountable hurdle of the blood being found in her car. This should be your first priority. You shouldnt be wasting any effort on minor issues like the key planting theory until youve proved to yourselves that the blood was planted. It wasnt and there is conclusive proof of this.Take my advice. Realise he is guilty because his blood was found in the car. Once youve come into the real world the rest of the case will make much more sense.If the blood was planted you need to ask yourself why didnt the defence test for EDTA? The answer is obvious. They knew it wouldnt be found. Therefore they knew SA was guilty. Testing the blood was their only chance to back up their planting theory. They had nothing else. They didnt test.

His lawyers obviously need to remain consistent on this but it wouldnt surprise me at all if they actually believed in his guilt from day one. What they and Zellner now salivate over is the manitowoc pd. Wisconsins criminal justice system is inept at best and totally corrupt at worst. They clearly had it out for Avery in the past on more than one occasion and even though that doesnt mean Avery isnt guilty of the murder of T.H. it does mean Manitowoc deserves every bit of scrutiny that they get as a result of this show.The only moral dilemma I see here is this Would enough good come of this to justify the exoneration of a murderer?

I dont really speak geek but I think we are in agreement.  The statistics dont apply so simply whenever we talk about a particular case with facts that may not be shared by other persons in the group.  But when we make a prediction about that case we should consider those facts.  The probability of wrongful conviction might be  if we randomly pick a case from the group and the same number would apply if we make a prediction without considering anything we know about the case.But is that a useful number if what we want to know is what is the probability that this person was wrongfully convicted? On this point I think we would have to say a number of facts would surely influence the odds one of which wed have to admit would include the existence of a pending lawsuit against the accusing officers.  Im not saying that makes framing likely by any means  nor do I believe he was framed  but it surely makes framing more likely than would be true for a randomlyselected case. ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d4owuth,2,t5_3buh7

When the blood is dried out  it is difficult to smear you can transfer color around but not as much liquid. Ten year old blood in a tube would be of reduced volume from losing fluid.

8450767,0,t1_d5xs7bd,Thank you and ditto.I think Colborn probably did plant the key when you take everything into account although I cant be certain of course.  Imagine Avery said Teresa hadnt left him a magazine but investigators they found one in his trailer.  So Avery says she must have dropped one cleverly hidden under her vehicle and the wind must have picked up and blew it into his trailer.  Its fair to say no one would believe such a far fetched story.  I understand about manpower by why on earth did Pagel say Manitowoc would not be involved.  Was it an error on his part just something he said to please the press and public.  It certainly didnt help with their credibility for an outside force to investigate the murder.Colborn and Lenk did volunteer to help and while thats not proof of anything being honest isnt just about saying youre honest it can also be about showing youre honest as in dont go anywhere near the investigation.  If Calumet were saying there is no way they could have conducted the investigation without them that would be very worrying!Imagine you wanted to frame someone you would need a narrative.  She was at Averys so thats opportunity covered. If her vehicle is on property that he had access to that would put him in the frame and allow for search warrants.  You need to tie him directly to the vehicle so lets put his blood in there.  How can we defiantly prove he put the vehicle there lets put the key somewhere where only he had access to.  The body doesnt have any of Averys DNA on it fluids etc so the body has to be destroyed but not to destroy evidence but because there would be no evidence on the body.  Lastly we need to put the victim in the trailer or garage but the trailer would have no blood in it because nothing happened there its better to say the garage so a bullet with the victims DNA on would do that and also show she was shot.Obviously if they found Averys prints in the Rav or a knife with Averys prints on and the victims blood I dont think anybody would have any doubts over Averys conviction.Im wasted I should have been a crime writer!!!,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d5xvrzz,1,t5_3buh7

Its irrational to believe someone else killed Halbach and police decided to let such killer go and instead to plant Averys blood in her vehicle then risk being seen driving her vehicle to the lot and hiding it there.  It irrational to believe someone else killed her then later learned that Avery had fires going on  shortly after Halbach left and therefore decided to burn her body and belongings and plan them in the ashes of his fire and also a few fragments in Jandas burn barrel.  Every suggestion you and your cohorts have are as absurd as any  conspiracy theory claim.  No rational person would suspect any of these things unless there were credible evidence that established these unbelievable things happened. You claims are so irrational they could never be made in a court without looking insane. There is no need for anyone to even bother addressing your nonsense.  We do so here for comic relief and fun.  ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d62jlh0,2,t5_3buh7
8500565,0,t1_d641t3g,Dear Mr. EditerTeresa came and she was nice. We said hello and goodbye and she handed me the stuff. We went to her car and I paid her and she left. She was always very nice. I called and asked for her at AutoTrader because she was always very nice. I didnt do none of what the prosecutors said. I left work early because I knew she was coming. I was gonna go back after but she took too long and I had a headache. I called her before she came because I wanted to take a nap make some phone calls and fix my snowmobile and wanted to make sure she was still coming but blocked my ID because I didnt want to confuse her because I called it in for my sister Barb Janda. After she left I saw her turn left onto Larrabee and I go back in to listen to Englebert Humperdinks greatest hits. Ma come over and gimme the mail ask her.  Bobby werent home went I went to ask him if he was going hunting. Earl and Bob Fabian come by when I was going to work on my snowmobile and I had thrown some old junk into the barrel that bother Bob. I dont know why Brendan say those things. None of it was true except we did have a fire and we did clean up the oil from my snowmobile. I find that bleach works great. He was coercified and didnt know what he was saying I always told him to stand up for himself. I always told Barb not to let her kids talk to cops without an adult. We put the tires and some other things on the fire and hung out. He tell me about his girlfriend and Blaine go to trick or treat. Brendan went home and then came back and Barb called me and tell me to put a jacket on him. I dont know how her bones got in there but someone put em there because they out to get me!!! Why no pictures of that burnpit?? They didnt let the coroner in to do no work. I know I done some bad things but Id never kill another person. I cut my finger and the blood got in my Grand Am they musta used that and put it in her car. Ask them why it take them so many times to find the key? Cause it wasnt there. Ask them why they had to make up a story about a kid to find that bullet. Only they would know!!!!!!!!!!PSMa asked me to get some more picters  of for her so I called her again but she didnt answer even though I didnt block my caller id this time!PPSThe picture of my dick was going to be sent to Jodi in jail. PPPS If you dont want to pay me for this let me know so I can speak to Laura and that videographer girl whatever her name is. They maybe can find some use for it if they ever release the movie they made about me. ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d644fwl,3,t5_3buh7

TH being killed by a third party and dumped on averys door step her last known whereabouts makes absolute sense.gtThe killer only needs to know that the burn pit had been used at some point LE could say hes lying about the last time he had a fire. Everyone says its Steven who targeted TH but for all we know there could be someone else who did.Could possibly be true but all criminal cases involve determining whether there is reasonable doubt not whether it is possible someone else committed the crime and planted evidence.  Absent a witness or video record virtually any murder could be explained by saying the evidence was planted by some unknown person. Merely establishing that SA might be a more likely target for framing than some other people proves nothing. There is substantial evidence directly linking SA to the crime and no evidence pointing to anyone else.  It would be nice if the prosecution could present a complete story of exactly how the crime occurred but it is not required by law and often not possible because no one else was present and criminals take steps to hide the evidence.  Here we not only have significant evidence linked to SA but evidence as well which is strongly indicative of his efforts to hide other evidence.  We have neither for anybody else. ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d65cjtk,1,t5_3buh7

8574953,0,t1_d6d1mkq,Police dont document things to prevent irrational people from making irrational accusations.  They document things when the photos and documentation will aid their investigation.Saying that they took the time and effort to plant the bones there and yet chose not to take any photos to help document they then excavated them from there makes no sense.   Nor does the argument that they didnt document it because it would have revealed they planted the bones hold any water because as I pointed out there is no way photos could help establish the bones had been planted and moved from elsewhere.   Photos only have the potential to prove bones were not moved.  It photos prove the bones were not agitated then they were not moved.  If they were agitated then by definition it means they were moved.  Photos cant help determine whether that movement took place within the confines of the burn location where they were found or whether they were agitated elsewhere and then relocated to the burn site where they were found.  Thus even if police had moved the bones there is no reason to fail to take photos if the goal it to make it appear they were found in the burn pit.I also addressed the nonsense claim that maybe a dozen police lied and made up that the bones had been found in his burn pit and that in fact nothing was in there ever and they just made up excavating items from it.  No rational person would believe a dozen people from  different agencies found the bones elsewhere created no radio reports or documentation of any kind related to such and agreed to pretend they found and excavated them from the burn pit and then created reports that detailed such lie.

They learned for the first time about the jeans on the th picked them up en route to the station with Brendan on March st. The police themselves have said they didnt view the garage as a crime scene until they learned about the bleached jeans and the garage floor cleaning.Stevens Appeal said it was probable cause based on info gained from Brendan on the  of Feb so it was the Jeans that led to the GaragegtPlaintiff alleges that on March   Officer Baldwin presented an affidavit for search warrant to District Attorney Kratz who notarized the document. Probable cause was based on a February   statement made by Brendan Dassey concerning the murder of Teresa Halbach. Officer Baldwin then obtained a search warrant from Judge Willis for items from plaintiffs residence and garage located in Manitowoc County. On March   Officer Baldwin submitted a return of search warrant for fortythree items taken from plaintiffs residence and garage.However in my response above with the link I was saying it was based on both.

They found handcuffs and leg irons in Averys bedroom. On February th the media reported that Avery was being investigated for a  sexual assault. Since December th  the media had been openly speculating that she was shot in the garage because of all the blood police reported finding in there with the shell casings. Back in November  Pagel described finding a bloodbath in multiple buildings. Police said blood bone fragments teeth and other evidence from the search of homes buildings and the acre salvage yard determined Halbach was slain and dismembered by Steven Avery who allegedly attempted to burn her body and other evidence. Kratz said he and Pagel called in Milwaukee Police Department officers who were involved in the Jeffrey Dahmer case since those officers also had to work with body parts in their investigation. Dahmer of Milwaukee was convicted in  of killing and dismembering  men.By December th everybody in Manitowoc already knew about the RAV and that both Teresa and Steves blood were found in the vehicle  they knew about the electronics in the burn barrel  the bones in the burn pit.

Something like MYTHBUSTERS is pretty good at doing these demonstrations. They have engineers and artists but in the background you got the scientists getting the facts right. Then they engineer it according to spec.However what we got a long time ago and what is an obvious issue is that the truther criteria for evidence is horribly illogical.For example There is not enough evidence of a murder  Steven Avery couldnt have done it he would have left more evidence that he couldnt possibly have cleaned up example lack of blood in his home.There is too much evidence of a murder  Steven Avery couldnt have done it because he would have cleaned it up example his blood in the RAV.So you will be dealing with mutually exclusive positions like this that are default logically bankrupt. It runs a scale of being irrational people who state this for the first time to the barking mad people who continue to say it again even though they know both positions clash.The definition of madness is repeating the same thing and expecting different results. In this case they think repeating a mutually exclusive view of forensics will free Steven Avery by demonstrating planting. It cant demonstrate it. In no logical universe can it work.The burden of proof is on the planting claim. It is up to them to prove it not for us to disprove.Anyway to your points. There is no reason why Steven Avery couldnt have done a cursory wipe down of parts of the vehicle missing spots and deliberately leaving blood the boot with an intention to go back later because he has a body to deal with first. The whole crime scene was found midclean up. Midclean up has full explanatory power for all the evidence.Friction forces are a fact of physics. Any earthquake video with items still standing on the shelf can demonstrate this. Why not just use references from the historical criminal record to show that murderers have cleaned up murders involving gun shotsstabbing etc.?Anyway I think your ideas are cool because its all science and thats great.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d6s6cl8,0,t5_3buh7

They read him his rights repeatedly were much nicer to him than he deserved and repeatedly implored him to tell them the truth and not what they wanted to hear.It will be a weird world we live in where a person can provide multiple lengthy false confessions be convicted based on nothing but those lies then turn around and sue the people who kept on telling him to be honest and stop with the lying.On second thought thats probably whats going to happen because we do live in a weird world.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d7625w4,2,t5_3buh7

His only admission of failure was that he shouldnt have employed OKelly or allowed detectives to interview Brendan while he was away.I cant help thinking though that if Kachinsky was there he would also have been telling Brendan to tell the truth to detectives about his part in the murder of Halbach even though he had initially told OKelly he had played no part.

8838998,0,t1_d796dr0,gtI have a lot of problems with the inclusion of . The first is that I dont think its implausible. The point of this list in general was to produce a list of the  main ways THs condition death or lack thereof could have occurred. It was to give a list of choices that one must choose from as the best option to deny.gtAny crime that SA commits is going to have a negative impact and therefore be lucky for LE. This is true.gtSecondly the inclusion of  is either not necessary or makes the list biased and incomplete. Its not that its incomplete given that it is supposed to summarize the five main theoretical choices of the case. Though I do think the wording of  as you pointed out was written poorly and betrays a bias.gt make sense together because they are about the manner in which TH died or the possibility that she did not die at all.  is a claim about the motive for LE to be involved in the death. This either does not fit with  or you need to put in a lot more judgments in terms of motive especially one for SA. It was poor word choice. On second thought what it should have read was It is implausible that someone other than LE or SA was behind the murder of TH.This would be representative of all the theories that include minor players in the relevant state of affairs. If you denied this judgement you would go on to say why you thought it deniable perhaps even suggesting someone in particular.gtThe fact that a party benefits in the death of someone should not cause a person to disregard all other facts about the case. If my uncle has left me a large inheritance in his will and hes murdered it doesnt make anyone elses involvement implausible and therefore Im the only one who could be guilty. Well no but if we were to make a similar list in which it was said it is implausible that tjrl killed his uncle and you were one of the major theories one could contend that denying that judgement is the best move to make which was the point of this list picking out which prima facie judgement is the best to deny because ultimately only one of their negations is most plausible to you generally speaking of course you could find two denials equally compelling and argue why thats the case if you so chose though that would obviously be more work.gtI should be investigated since that is a motive but if all evidence points to another person then thats the most likely suspect. If the evidence was such that it also pointed to another suspect then they also would be one of the main theories for which we could formulate the relevant prima facie judgement just as we have for this case.gtEvidence is a much more important factor to weigh than making claims solely on who benefits most.Surely. But if the evidence is circumstantial and it is plausible to suggest that some of the evidence in the total case is planted based on further scrutiny of said evidence which would be evidence relevant to the case in toto as well then that line of thought must be considered as well.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d7abm5t,0,t5_3buh7

9265922,0,t3_5784hu,Re Ballistics TestingThere is a  National Academy of Sciences report on bullet lead analysis that was produced upon request of the FBI to determine the legitimacy of the concept of metallurgical analysis of bullets the FBI had been doing it for some years.  KZ wants to use NAA Neutron Activation Analysis.  This was used by the FBI up until .  According to the report the FBI used it to determine the quantities of  nonlead elements.  The main drawback of this method is it requires access to a nuclear reactor.  From  until they discontinued this test the FBI used ICPOES Inductively Coupled PlasmaOptical Emission Spectroscopy.  During the period they used it the FBI increased the number of elements they looked at to .  The NAS described this test as the proper one to use for this analysis and recommended the FBI look at a high performance version of this test for better discrimination.The biggest problem with this analysis is not scientific.  The problem stems from the way the ammo is manufactured.  There is great metallurgical variability among manufacturers and within a single manufacturer.  This is due to the fact that much of the raw materials used to manufacture bullets is scrap lead arriving at the manufacturer from a wide variety of sources.  The FBIs own analysis determined that within a single box of ammo they found up to  different compositions or batches of manufacture.  The NAS confirmed this and confirmed that there was no way to statistically predict from manufacturing data what they would find in the box.  So the issue is not the analysis it is what it tells you and how you use the information.  The conclusion is that knowing the composition of the metals in a bullet does not tell you conclusively that it came from a specific box of ammo nor does it tell you it couldnt have come from a specific box.  In short there is no probative value.  As a result of their own analysis and the NAS report the FBI no longer does this testing.KZs request to include this analysis in the petition for testing perhaps gives a window as to her intent. In this case both the FBI and the NAS have determined that knowing compositions of bullets is not probative and that bullets in a box from the manufacturer are likely to have different compositions. She is hoping to get an answer that shows the evidence bullet to be of different composition to one or more from the box in Averys trailer and then claim someone else must have fired this shot. Is this subterfuge? Is it a subversion of the system? At minimum it seems intellectually dishonest. Hopefully the judge has someone tell him about this NAS report prior to his ruling.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d8qis9b,6,t5_3buh7

Makes little sense considering she was never there to examine it and received the remains after they were moved.Very good possibility S and B had no knowledge considering Reimer and Fauske werent testifying at trial and they didnt need to prepare for them. Lenk was there and he didnt sign on his way in. So unless you were there how do you know which way he came in or where he was? The checkpoint officer certainly didnt know or he would have been signed in correctly.Seems to me like you are trying to debate minutia that doesnt really make a lot of difference anyways. ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d8xel25,6,t5_3buh7
9330244,0,t1_d8y1hqp,IAdefinitelyNAL but those cases look from those judgements like the state was petitioning for a stay on an order already issued and the court was granting it along with provisions for bond.  Thats not the case here this decision was on a petition by Brendan not the state.  Duffin ruled on the Habeus petition and included the stay in his ruling but didnt address the bond issue at all.  It seems Nirider is arguing that just because the original order doesnt address bond doesnt mean the court cant grant it now.

9333114,0,t1_d8z0emw,And you seem to misunderstand civil procedure.  There is no evidence in the record that the trial court considered the Hilton factors prior to allegedly denying bail.  If that is where we find ourselves procedurally then his purported decision is reversible on that basis alone.Better for the State to argue that no Hilton analysis is necessary because the order requiring release has been stayed.  The argument goes like this  Your honor currently there is no active executory decision that orders the release of the prisoner and therefore no analysis under c or d is either necessary or appropriate.  End of story I have nothing further.  Thank you.      Much cleaner than getting into a pissing match about which way the Hilton factors weigh particularly since bail was allegedly denied without any passing reference to or consideration of those factors.  ltlt Again reversible on its face.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d8z1gnn,4,t5_3buh7

Came from the wrong side of the tracks and unfairly judged by everyone.Now when I think of how he acted in his early interviews all casual talking to reporters it gives me a sort of horrified feeling.Its still unreal to see thousands of people around the world giving such a person umptold benefit of the doubt and expressing tremendous empathy.

I dont think Avery deserves extra consideration compared to any other felon in Wisconsin and if it is determined these tests are a second bite of the apple and impermissible then so be it.

9512203,0,t1_d9lix7x,This  framing claim was made by the MaM series in gt No it wasnt. Thats ludicrous. So what do you think the civil suit was about? They accidentally got it wrong?What is your source for the framing of Avery in ? You have provided NOTHING but anecdotes.Averys own civil suit says nothing about framing. It says actions and omissions. It is called negligence and specifically failing him on the th amendment.We know from the victim that the framing claim is false. She has clearly said she made a mistake in the identification not that LE setup SA or she was led to point out SA.gt Totally incorrect. She does think she was led to point out Steven. Heres her own wordsgt At the time I didnt know anything about how memory works about what good procedures are about showing lineups to victims. The perpetrator was not in the photo lineup I was shown. I never had an opportunity to identify my actual assailant. The sheriff later put together a live lineup. There were eight men and I again picked Steven Avery. He was the only person who was in both so its logical that I would pick him.Where does it say she was involved in framing him? It doesnt. Read the whole interview She even says the first time she doubted she made the right choice was when her neighbour asked her if she was sure. The entire interview tells you she felt she was to blame for the mistake not entirely. Not that there was a conspiracy. Which clearly puts a spanner in your works. Especially since in the same interview she says SA is guilty for murdering TH. SA was a bad dude on their radar for what he did to his cousin exposing himself holding her at gun point etc.gt At the point she said this she knows that the MTSO had information that Allen was most likely her assailant.No she doesnt say back then MTSO knew this. SA was already on LEs radar that year for exposing himself to his cousin and running her off the road and pointing a gun at her.gt But back up to when she didnt know and you have an exchange between her and city police where she learned from the Manitowoc Police department that they believed Allen committed the crimegt I remember hanging up the phone thinking Oh my God maybe the wrong person is in custody.Where does it say MTSO believed Allen committed the crime?gt So she called the Sheriffs departmentgt The sheriffs department said The Manitowoc police department doesnt have jurisdiction. We will look into this. Dont talk to them it will only confuse you.gt Hmmm. Yep she definitely doesnt think she was led to identify Steven.No it doesnt say she believes there was a conspiracy. Where do lawyers say talk to police without consulting them first? She is being given the best advice she can get. Dont talk to them directly. Any judge on the planet worth their salt would say the same thing.gt Even the Avery Bill doesnt say what you want it to say.gt Woah there buddy. Youre letting your strawman show. I never once made a claim to what was in the bill. I only spoke about the unanimous support it received. Unanimous. That didnt happen in a vacuum. Several legislators said it was because of the troubling circumstances surrounding Averys wrongful conviction and other cited the overwhelming public support for Avery.Troubling circumstances doesnt equal framing which you havent demonstrated was ever said directly anywhere by anyone yet. All we have is MAM from  saying it because of Steven Averys interviews in his cabin after he ran off. You can try to guess that is what people meant to say but negligence not framing explains everything you said so far. All of it.gt And this whole discussion would seem a lot less disingenuous if you yourself hadnt claimed a month ago that Kratz had to hold the press conference to counter the positive media attention Steven was receiving due to the perception of his previous wrongful conviction.Steven was on the media claiming MTSO had gravitated from falsely imprisoning him to planting dead bodies in his yard. Do you think the state is just going to let that one sit?Do you think all wrongful convictions are framing or something?gt Nope and thats not what I even came close to saying. But most wrongful convictions involving witness misidentification share a pattern of intentional police misconduct that led to that misidentification.The fact is MaM doesnt show all three photos overlapping. AllenAveryComposite. They all overlap and more importantly Avery who has blue eyes doesnt have dark eyes like Allen or the composite which has Allens nose and mouth matching better than Averys along with all the other traits. How disingenuous is that?Anyway do you have a source for your claims the public believed Avery was framed in  other than Avery claiming this in his interviews after falling under suspicion for being involved in THs death or not? If not then your original famous claims fall apart. Which appears to be what is happening. ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,d9lkxuh,2,t5_3buh7

Did Kayla say anything about the crime scene that was not already known by the general public? Nope.  Without her recanted statement so there is no evidence that Brendan ever made any incriminating statements to Kayla or anyone else before his arrest. The first mention of screaming was by Fassbender when he asked if Brendan heard screaming between Steve and Teresa on the porch. Aside from Brendans comments we dont know if there was any screaming. There is no forensic evidence that she was ever in the trailer and the prosecution did not present any evidence that there was screaming. gt FASSBENDER What did you do then?

I still cant tell if Fassbender and Wiegert were incredibly gullible  willfully blind or deliberately trying to set him up.gtReally man? This is a clear example of narrating. How do you know he didnt gag her mouth? Blown out his eardrums?  yards?Can you not imagine how loud it must have been inside the trailer if Brendan can hear her screaming a half way down the lane? And how can he hear her if she is gagged?gtOh please or else what? He goes to jail for the crimes they already had him confess to? Fassbender threatened him twice with charging him at the start of the February  interview at the high school.  At that point Brendan had not yet adopted any of their suggests.  And a threat like this would have much more of an impact when you know your own uncle was imprisoned for something he did not do.  And yes  being threatened with a  year sentence would be very persuasive in his calling his mother to say he did some of it  and some of it meaning that he helped clean some reddish fluid from the floor.To believe the confession you have to believeThat he would rummage through burning garbage  while a girl is screaming in the background. That he placed his penis in the vagina and held it there for  minutes. That Steve only stabbed her threes inches deep in the stomach or ribs and that he cut her neck from ear to ear only skin deep. Neither wounds would be immediately fatal but both would result in a tremendous amount of bleeding.  That they would carry her nude bleeding through the house  into the garage and in and out of the RAV and casting blood all over the inside of the cargo door panel and bottom door sill and carpeting yet not a forensic drop anywhere else in the trailer or garage. That they would use a creeper to carry her to the fire. How is that even possible? And how can there be no blood or DNA on the creeper? They placed her body in the fire while it was still light out so before pm. Fabian  Scott and Bobby all testified there was no fire behind the garage at this time.That they burned the body and broke up the bones in less than  minutes from start to finish May  statement. And besides  we know he wasnt involved because he was with Blaine during the entire time of his alleged involvement and then he was with Bryan until pm. And lets not forget  Steve was convicted beyond a reasonable doubt of murdering Teresa before Brendan got home from school.

I could see saying that if I was choosing random things. I an simply adhering to things that are supported by other independent means. The fact that they all line up and square the same thing a cannot be dumb luck.gtMaybe Im giving Brendan too much wiggle room but someone with an IQ of  isnt going to be playing games. an IQ of  puts him at a mental ability of a yearold.Yeah. Nobody is denying that he had some issues but he wasnt on par with a  year old. I agree he was suggestible and could be led which I why I think he was led even if LE were not specifically trying to do so.gtYou find it more likely that she out of the blue made up that story and it somehow matched his future story to copsgtNo i find it more likely that she did what all good liars do and tweaked a real event into a lie.Except how would you explain that it matched in advance  Brendans story about the fire and body parts? How is that even conceivable that she could make something up kick off events and everything fall in behind it? Then to top off that Brendan verifies having told her? And to have Brendan support her claims and she his? It all meshes including the multiple admissions to his own mother not of rape and murder but of having done some of it. He told her you know I did it. No hesitation there no doubt. He objected and pointed out what was not true when he spoke to her not his being involved but that he had sold crack.gtIts not a single addition its half of the entire confession. like I said earlier we cant cherry pick the bits that make sense and forget all the tonnes of bullshit that clearly means nothing.Again it isnt cherry picking if the facets are supported and in turn support other facets.gtIm fully willing to accept that Im wrong but is any of this enough to send someone to prison for life? I dont think so.I agree. That isnt what we are discussing although clearly relevant.gtI think thats my problem with this nobody can actually prove hes done anything wrong this is why I hope his confession stays thrown out so long as that happens its only a matter of time before hes released.The only way to conclude that he did nothing wrong is to throw out evidence physical and circumstantial forget the fact that he and Avery matched lies. Assume that Kayla made up story that somehow gels with things people would later say independently and without influence from her statements forget that he supplied info unprompted despite what people say forget that he confirms Kaylas account and she corroborates parts of his. Then proceed to ignore the fact hat he clearly admitted some level of involvment to his mother in  instances during a phone call and conclude that he had only done so because the cops told him that if he didnt her they would? As I said I am only putting stock in things that are supported independently. And that is that he helped with the fire and clean up knew something and lied about it.No theres not I was just spitballing just like Brendan did  I assure you if your spitballing had as much behind as Brendans Id come to the same conclusion.

We know the key was photographed after the cabinet was pushed back to the wall so that killed the the key flew out of the cabinet and to the left story.

So obviously once everything was found the key is insignificant but at that time it was the only direct link to Avery.Personally the weird way it was found leads me to believe it wasnt planted.  If they were going to plant it and all lie on stand about how it was found why wouldnt they come up with a simple story?  Say it was in the pocket of some sweatpants and photograph it there or in a drawer.  Why just throw it on the ground and need to stick to a weird story about shaking the bookcase?  If these guys were expert enough planters to plant the blood bullet etc without detection were supposed to believe they couldnt think of a better way to plant the key than to throw it on the floor?  Doesnt make any sense.  Its almost like because the story is weird they must be telling the truth because anyone lying would come up with a story that wouldnt be questioned.

10816032,0,t1_ddvh09s,Although Ill have to reflect on what youve said a few statements raise some questions for me. . .gtWell younger people tend to be more trusting of adults especially ones in a position of authority.I think this is probably true in the case of relatively young children.  I do not however think it is very true of yearolds. gtIQ is about interpreting real world capabilities. If your IQ is lower it suggests you have less ability to cope with situations that are unusual to you new or out of your control. My sense is there is much disagreement about exactly what IQ measures but Im not sure Ive seen it expressed in terms of ability to cope and am not sure what you mean by this.  Do you mean less ability to successfully achieve the outcome you desire?gtYou have less ability to interpret things in the way that others with a normal or higher level would do. Im not sure whether I understand or agree.  Ive read for example that IQ tests dont measure social intelligence which seems to be the sort of thing you are describing.  Not to be flip but my dog seems to be extraordinarily good at reading my mood and behavior based on all sorts of subtle cues that Im sure exist yet no doubt doesnt have a measurable IQ. But if youre right do you think it would be fair to say that the differences in interpretation would not necessarily follow some predictable particular patterngtIf they stole are asked for example if they stole something they may blame the dog a baby a stuffed toy an adult or older child who is not in the room  they may run through the lot of them just to present themselves in the best possible way either so they are not scolded or even to try and get rewarded.Wouldnt you say this is true of a great many adults and indeed dont most people attempt to present themselves in the best possible way often distorting or lying about the real facts to achieve an objective?,StevenAveryIsGuilty,ddvliop,2,t5_3buh7

11160739,0,t1_dewyqsg,Ok cool ab reading the book bc I couldnt figure out how to explain wo it and Ill probably still do a shit job. Would you agree that the parts about SA in the book is a memoir of his time spent during the SA trial? If so isnt it reasonable for to include emotional feelings and thoughts he experienced during it just as anyone that writes a memoir about something they have experienced? He isnt saying he still believes to this day that ManC would have killed SA and at the time he had the paranoia thought he didnt have  years to be like ok perhaps thats going a little too far. It was an impulsive reaction.As for why he had the paranoia again that he admitted to without any reason to because ManC never murdered anyone might be better explained here instead of trying to think of a scenario to have you think back to a time you experienced whats in the link. Remember the lady in Texas that died in her jail cell and there was a brief moment where people thought PD killed her? This stuff happens to people all the time. Gah I can think of a few experiences myself because I have this happen far too often to me so maybe thats why I understood what he was talking about. If nothing else you may find it interesting to read more about just for shits and giggles. If nothing else check out SPECT scans. I love looking at those.

11321723,0,t1_dff5x00,gtI hope we can all agree that bias towards Avery due to the pending legal action regarding the  case existed.My problem with this statement is that I dont believe there has been any evidence to this effect presented.  On the contrary what Ive come to conclude from press coverage and accounts of locals who were there at the time was that Avery was a bit of a folk hero rubbing elbows with the Governor and most people knew hed been wronged and deserved compensation.  And the ominous villain Colborn rather than being representative of a community looking down their noses at poor rust farmers was a long time customer and friend of Averys brother.The lens I look at the  conviction through is that at the time Avery had put himself on the police radar.  He had a juvenile record that we are not privy to and then had graduated to more serious criminal mischief and burglary and then demonstrated willingness to move to sexual crimes and violence exposing himself to SM and simulating masturbation then assaulting her with his car.  Plus I regretfully have to mention the cat.  If there was bias that initially pointed the Sheriff in his direction it was due to the fact Avery conditioned police to believe he was capable of the crime and set an expectation with them that this was a next step in the escalating pattern of violence that Judge Willis referred to later.  I think this is the origin you are looking for.  And I would say it is likely that the magnitude of the conditioning or bias was enhanced by the fact that it was a Deputys wife that Avery chose to attack and attempt to kidnap at gunpoint on the side of the road.  I would agree that the extent that Averys record would lead police to believe he did the PB crime was greater than an average person with the exact previous record due to the SM incident.  Thats the lens I would expect them to be looking through when considering the PB case.I think the  case had a huge element of LUCK also and bad luck for Avery.  What are the odds that Avery and GA look so similarwith the same mountain man hair and beard?  Then you have a traumatized victim wrested from a somewhat idyllic life in an instant by a senseless and violent act against her and in that moment the police show her a photo lineup including the guy they think the sketch looks like and she identifies Avery and apparently imprints his image on her memory.  It appears to me that Manitowoc PD and MTSO operated very separately and autonomously in those days.   Their systems were not integrated and there is no real indication that they had any real liaison or kept each other up to date on current issues.  It appears to me though I could well be misinformed that GAs sphere of behavior happened in MPD jurisdiction and SAs happened in MTSO.  It does not appear that GA despite being a subject of active surveillance by MPD was on the MTSO radar at all.  If he had been I think they would have included him with Avery in the original photo array.  He would have been an obvious choice.So in summary re  my view is that Averys selection as the target for prosecution was initially logical police work and largely brought on by his own history.  Then once PB made such a positive ID she did not have doubts initially but apparently did have some after the taunting phone calls the ball was rolling.  It seems to me that after the ball was rolling was where the mistakesmalfeasance occurred.  Additional information came in at some point where MPD gave input to MTSO at the Koucerek level and Vogel that was ignored for whatever reason.  I dont know why and kind of wish we had heard their story through the deposition process.  It could be that they each actually did have a deep seated personal bias against Steve or even the other Averys and willfully acted to screw Steve or it could just be that they had confirmation bias they reinforced with each other or it could simply be sloppy work by locally powerful rural fat and happy law enforcement.  There was an opportunity to derail the train prior to the prosecution that was not taken missed.  And in the mid s there was an apparent opportunity that was not pursued after the phone call from some other jurisdiction to correct things perhaps maliciously perhaps by chance or more ineptness.  The end result of course we know now is Steve was screwed.  And deserved compensation.So this leads us back to gtI hope we can all agree that bias towards Avery due to the pending legal action regarding the  case existed.The TH murder was  years later and the actors in the PB case were gone.  Why is there an assumption that bias had carried over from the previous management and members of the system?  BampS coined the term institutional bias to claim this but Im failing to see where it was actually shown to exist.  If it did how was it disseminated was it taught in the Police Academy year after year to pass it down?  Avery was out of their purview all those years he was imprisoned.  He was not in their jurisdiction committing more crimes so was not on their radar as a continuous offender as he had been in the  generation of deputies.  Im kind of searching for the bridge that made this bias continue on but not finding it.  MAM tried to use the lawsuit as the bridge by showing the lurid parts of the depositions but these were edited to give the viewer a narrative that is unsupported by any other facts that I have seen anyway.So thats my reaction to where youve gone so far.  I appreciate your thoughtful contribution. ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,dffaquo,6,t5_3buh7

11572762,0,t1_dg7piji,gtThat doesnt match what is written in the report that uMinerva just linked. Theres no mention of Sang seeing the perp.Thats true. She came out with the claim she saw the man and  details about the man after reading the press releases about the trial testimony.The report simply indicates she saw the victim.  This is Greisbachs account The situation was this apparently a woman named Kathy Sang had been interviewed by the sheriffs department during the investigation she had been in the sailboat seen by Penny during the first leg of her run on the beach. Sang told the detective that on the beach that day she had spotted a man with a beer belly wearing a black shirt and pants walking north. After this Sang had been shown a picture of Steven Avery and asked if he was the man she had seen on the beach to which she had adamantly replied no. There was absolutely no evidence of this interview in Vogels notes even though it had taken place well before trial.The above dishonestly suggests that the police interview was concealed from the defense.  It also falsely asserts she told police she saw the perp. It also implies that she was shown a photo of Avery which is untrue that was after the trial by the defense lawyer on appeal. It also suggests that Vogel did something wrong by not writing about her in his notes and considering her insignificant like the trial defense did.  ,StevenAveryIsGuilty,dg7s1i9,2,t5_3buh7

11677530,0,t1_dgh9fxe,gtThats why Im a bit taken aback by MGs insistence that GA was indeed the unidentified prowler and therefore should have been a prime suspect in the PB assault.In fairness it isnt just MG who reached this conclusion.  The DOJ reached the same conclusion   that if the sheriff had reviewed the police files Allen would have been a prime suspect in the assault on PB.  Based on the information in  the police files and his appearance Allen  would certainly have been at least as good a suspect as Avery.  PB was never shown a photo of Allen nor was he included in a lineup. When she picked Avery in a lineup it was only after she had been shown a photo of him and of no one else in the lineup. Contrary to claims in the OP there is no evidence the sheriff made inquiries of the police department and absolutely nothing to support the idea police refused to supply confidential files.  The undisputed information in the DOJ report is that police detective Bergner went to Kocourek to discuss the PB case and to ask if Kocourek knew about Allen and was told by Kocourek that Allen had been ruled out as a suspect in PBs case. This is directly contrary to the suggestion in the OP that the sheriff simply reasonably elected not to look into Allen as a suspect.The same DOJ report indicated however that the sheriff departments file does not suggest other suspects were seriously considered and contained no information regarding an investigation into Allen.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,dgjnxme,1,t5_3buh7

That is not police trucking him or forcing him.So if investigators implied that anyone who claimed they couldnt remember a fire could be considered as someone who was attempting to cover for Avery wouldnt have persuaded anyone to say  Well now you mention it yeah I do remember one.gtMoreover at the end of November when he spoke ot the AP and told them he did have a fire on  and it was only to burn brush and tires you say he said this because police fooled him on August  into believing he had a fire by asking him if he had one and from that point forward he was fooled into thinking he had a fire that day thus in March he told Barb that the fire was out by  because he sent Brendan home by then and spoke to Jodi over the phone.I dont know why you cant get this.  Avery admits to a fire without any prompting or anyone telling him there was a fire.  So he just told investigators  I dont know if you know this but there was a fire or the Monday but I had forgotten all about it but just wanted to let you know.  Was that the conversation?gtIn was in a lot full of over a thousand vehicles not a few. The thought of a flyover would not cross his mind and even if it had why would he think that they would be able to identify it was her vehicle in a flyover? Newsflash they failed to locate her vehicle in the flyover. Hiding it among the other junked vehicles would be vastly superior to driving a vehicle with his blood inside risking police pulling him over in it and leaving it  miles away and then walking home. It is also better than crushing the vehicle and selling it to a recycler who will report the VIN and then police will find out that her vehicile was crushed at Avery salvage and sold for scrap. That is a much surer way of being caught than hiding it. But when did you ever face reality? You pretend any nonsense you feel like as opposed to facing facts like that Avery had a fire on .So why was there a flyover of the salvage yard if it would have been impossible to locate the vehicle?  Why was there a subsequent flyover that did see the vehicle even though according to you it would have been impossible to have see?  gtBecause I am a rational sentient being unlike you. As a rational sentient being I understand that the AP asked Avery about the casings police found in his garage and that Avery tried to explain the away by claiming he collected casings fired by his nephews and placed them in his garage.Avery was asked about shell casings.  He say he picked loads up around the yard.  Does that mean they are the same castings?  No. gtHe claimed he shot outside the garage into a gopher hole. Firing the gun straight down into a hole is not going to resulting in casings going in the garage. The gun ejects to the right the only way for the gun to eject into the garage would be if she was shooting at something that was near Barbs house. His attempt to protect Avery making up shooting into a hole near the garage failed.So you know his exact position and angle of fire while shooting in a hole?  How? gtThere was one visible and for all you know weathering or the dog exposed that one piece.So the dog could get to the front of the burn pit?  Thats not what the evidence says.gtHe needed the key he couldnt get rid of it. He may have needed to move her vehicle so saved the key. Moreover he needed the key to get inside to clean it out. he locked it on purpose so no one could get inside. He got rid of all the other keys that he didnt need would be able to give away they were her keys if he had kept the entire set together.So Avery thought if I only keep one of her keys Im in the clear but if I keep them all Ive had it!  Is that really your argument?gtNo clown they would have not the first damn clue how to make sure they burned a body enough to be able to still identify who it belonged to and that it was humanBeing as even I could do that Im not sure how you can make that claim!  So if you burnt a body you would personally think there was absolutely no way anyone could ever tell it was human?  Or that if there was some tissue remaining DNA wouldnt be found in that tissue?  Dont murder anyone you WILL be caught instantly!  gtDavis is at least the second one found guilty of murder Avery came before him. It makes little difference that the victim of the other one I cited didnt actually die. You tried to pretend that there ins no way exonerees would resort to violent crime after being exonerated which is nonsense. People with violent pasts like Avery who ran a lady off the road and tried to kidnap her at gunpoint often do still commit crimes after they get out of prison.I claimed a statistical fact that Avery was the FIRST exoneree to be charged with murder.  Why argue a know fact?  gtYou cant find any evidence of a case where someone framed or attempted to frame someone by burning a body and then planting the cremains because doing such would be absurd. Someone trying to frame him would plant the vehicle with her remains inside of it not to burn her and bury her ashes hoping someone would think he had a huge fire where it was burned.Avery was in affect being framed for abducting sexually assaulting and then killing someone.  Without the sexual assault there was zero motive to have abducted and killed her.  He had nothing against her nor would he have financially gained from her death. If an intact body was recovered then there would have been no evidence that Avery had ever assaulted her in any way.  So no someone trying to frame him WOULDNT have left the body in the vehicle.,StevenAveryIsGuilty,dgmyxz8,1,t5_3buh7
