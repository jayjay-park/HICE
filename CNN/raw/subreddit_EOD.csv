2299117,0,t1_clvp0j1,Yeah definitely agree. Feel bad for the kids stuck there in the barracks now. Rumor is no drinking at all and a stupid early curfew and bed checks even on weekends.,EOD,clvvy3a,1,t5_2sl8q

That aside you will probably run two incidents for your team leader cert and never run as a team leader again. Youre expected to generally know your shit so that you dont say something stupid in front of whomever you are supporting but youll still have to ask your PSG whats up from time to time. Your job is making sure you keep your guys trained and try to create some decent opportunities for them instead of doing the same old shit everyday. I dont know anything about the culture problems youre talking about. I havent seen any crazy backstabbing going on. In general I like my job.EOD LTs put in SOF packets all the time and sometimes leave EOD less than two years after they got there. Nothing EOD can do about it not that they care because there are more than enough captains to fill command slots anyway.Ive never heard of anyone getting DLI or airborne but if youre at a post with air assault its usually very easy to get. There are some very cool EOD schools though like advanced IEDs and various HME courses where you make explosives. Youll be lucky to go to any of them though.Youll go on at least two VIPs for your team leader certs and then let your team leadersteam members run the rest unless youre a greedy fuck which Ive seen.Not a whole lot of EOD officer to EOD civilian opportunities since you dont have that vast technical experience but I havent exactly looked all that hard since its not a longterm goal of mine anyway. Ive heard theres a EOD airport gig youre the explosives safety officer or something with one spot per airport but I dont know anything about it. ,EOD,cxp9dhl,1,t5_2sl8q

7181999,0,t1_d1slcyp,I am very intrigued by this. Im an E Army TL and intend on pursuing my masters after my ETS date. Id like to keep ties to the career field but I dont want drill or AT ruining a semester for me. This is literally exactly what Im looking for. So if anyone knows if this is common practice or based on command discretion only specific units are known to do it Id appreciate any info.,EOD,d1uj3lf,1,t5_2sl8q

I wont link it because the group is invite only and I dont want people stumbling upon it who shouldnt be. If you want I can PM you youll see some good talking points.Also can you edit my title?

10193979,0,t1_dbzj3sw,This is very accurate and the number one killer is treading. Theres also a surprising amount of people who drop because they are slow runners. Theres a huge misconception with new guys going Navy EOD that meeting the minimum standards is enough to get you through the physical aspect of training in all honesty if you want the best chance of making it to schoolhouse you should be pushing competitive scores for BUDS. A good amount of the fleet returnees that will be going through the whole pipeline with all the guys straight out of Boot Camp are prior BUDS students and usually theyre on a different level physically and thats who youll be running against.       The minimum standards you need to achieve are always there but your daily PT which is an all day thing at prep will typically exceed the fitness level required to reach the minimum standards.      To answer OPs other questions prep teaches you how to do in water checks with your dive buddy. Dive school is going to be a lot of running and swimming getting wet and sandy and learning how to dive two different rigs. I was also a certified diver coming in to dive school and I cant recall it helping me at all. Students who are not certified will be able to get their civilian license through school. ,EOD,dbzjkrs,12,t5_2sl8q
