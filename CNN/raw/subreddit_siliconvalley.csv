575696,0,t3_20pxr9,Ive been saving to buy in downtown SJ. Right near the college and down town. I think that gives the best options for future renting and a more active local social life. IMO,siliconvalley,cg5pm47,6,t5_2qovh

7686829,0,t3_4kkiz3,Maybe its representative of what Silicon Valley has become but its nothing like what made it great.  A closer version of that Halt and Catch Fire  Basically things have gone down hill  todays tech is trailingedge tech  it used to be about leadingedge tech.  You can still find that in biotech and in certain niche areas that still exist but most are ebbing or have already left the US now.  Innovation is not here.,siliconvalley,d3fy0d9,8,t5_2qovh
8703290,0,t1_d6t3ra7,The entire interview process is flawed but there isnt a good alternative imo.  Its basically two people putting on an act and making a life changing decision based on an hour conversation.Not sure what a homework app is but when I had to interview people at my last job my preferable way of doing it was to have a casual intro conversation just asking what their interests are recent projects they worked on what they enjoy working on how they keep up on technology etc.  Then I would ask general tech questions such as if they follow any design patterns if they know the SOLID objectoriented principles and other basic questions I cant think of right now.Then we gave them a test to build a simple contact form with validation that sends an email to us with the forms data in it.  They could either work on it in the office or take it home.I prefer this way of interviewing since you get to know their personality as well an idea of their technical competence.  I never understood how making people code on a whiteboard or asking them logic questions off the top of their head was a good way of interviewing unless they code on whiteboards then maybe.Granted the last place I worked on we werent doing any high end coding just relatively simple website and webbased apps so we werent looking for rockstar developers.,siliconvalley,d6tjm9e,1,t5_2qovh

11243350,0,t1_df6df1l,In LA pay range usually starts around years of experience. Not sure how it works in Silicon Valley. Ive designed  mobile apps designed mainly for iOS devices and have done a few web design responsive site design. Total of  years. I guess if it comes up Ill ask them what they were thinking in terms of pay range. They ideally wanted someone with  years of experience. Anyways thanks for your input,siliconvalley,df6f0z8,1,t5_2qovh
