In all honesty my calories were almost at maintenance this weekend because I went out and had some drinks with the girls... but I have been so close to the  mark all week and I guess all that club dancing I did tipped me over. Yay!,teamreindeer,cwtsud5,6,t5_3ag1i

Ive seen this mentioned on rfitness but maybe its a myth. I would have to look for some research on it to confirm. ,teamreindeer,cxah46s,2,t5_3ag1i

5840651,0,t1_cxl6t8e,I think the half LB doesnt really mean anything. last week just as the day of weigh in I was at exactly lb. But i havent seen my scale ever gone back to there or below since friday. it even went back to  yesterday but today I went back down to .. the little fluctuation of the  or  weight doesnt really matter that much you just have to focus on the bigger picture. I know that my highest number this week isnt as high as the week before so I can see my weight just going down steadily.  ,teamreindeer,cxl8im2,3,t5_3ag1i
