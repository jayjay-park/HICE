109114,0,t3_1vc44v,My favorite is this arrangement for the melodica of Montis Czardas proving once again that the quality of the musician matters much more than the instrument for creating amazing performances. Also any solo piece played on the double bass that was originally for cello or violin such as this version of the Rococco Variations  The difference in timbre on the double bass helps me experience the piece from a fresh angle and the visual difference seeing the performers hands move over a much greater distance along the fingerboard than they would on the original instrument is very impressive as well.  I dont have a recording but I heard a live performance of Haydns C Major Cello concerto played on the panpipes a few years back at the Fete de la Musique in Geneva.  It was a stunning performance.

119436,0,t3_1vfuul,Disagree.  Nothing against Stravinsky or his amazing music I just think differently than he did.Music is by its nature an emotional and expressive endeavor.  Youll often see a piece or a song written in response to a significant event  falling in love breaking up having a child losing a child political or cultural strife personal victory etc.  The piece may mean something completely different to the listener and the composer but it still means something beyond just notes on a page.In theory one could argue that society has dictated certain musical patterns meaning one thing or another  minor music being sad or spooky the wholetone scale being ethereal and dreamlike so on and so forth and that you shouldnt read into it beyond just the musical gestures themselves.  But if youre not allowing the music to move you  whether in your own way or in the typical social way whats the point of listening to it?  You could also technically argue that a novel is just words in a book that it doesnt express anything other than sentences put backtoback but by the ideas laid out by generations of linguistic development these sentences gain meaning and reading an emotional personal piece of prose or poetry can evoke any assortment of feelings from the reader.

569976,0,t1_cg4s7n7,gtAlso I have to believe that Bach and Handel would have chosen modern instruments if they had a choice. Of course they would have.  In fact in their day they were writing for modern instruments.   Theres no reason to believe that they wouldnt be doing the same if they were alive and composing today.  However they also would have written differently if they were writing for modern instruments.  Bach wrote the violin partitas to accommodate for the sound of the baroque gutstring violin he wrote the WellTempered Clavier to make the best use of the harpsichord in a baroque tuning he wrote the orchestral suites with the size and style of a baroque ensemble in mind.  If hypothetically he were writing for our violins pianos and orchestras but in the baroque idiom the music still would have been different.  Musicians who play music written for older instruments on newer instruments will adapt and interpret differently to suit the newer instrument.  Ask somebody who is equally adept at piano and harpsichord to play a Bach piece first on one and then on the other and their interpretation on one will be completely different from their own interpretation on the other.  The reason why they dont play with the exact same technique touch phrasing ornamentation etc on the modern piano is because the modern piano calls for different technique touch phrasing and ornamentation.  If Bach were writing for the modern piano instead of the harpsichord he would have kept those updated parameters in mind.,classicalmusic,cg527tq,3,t5_2qhyq

Be sure youre happy with your performance before you perform. Practice to the point where you know how loud every forte is how soft every piano how long the fermatas are held. If you arent certain that you have the ability to realize your interpretation when you perform then youre gonna be a lot more nervous.. Before you go on stage think about how you are without a doubt the best musician in the building. Think about how awesome you are how incredibly talented how the audience is going to be blown away by your sheer musicality. Convince yourself that youre confident basically. . When you start playing focus entirely on the sound. If you remember that the audience is there youre not focusing hard enough. When you really get in the zone nothing will faze you.

This is something very rare in my experience to have a conductor be so vocal during rehearsals. It was one of my favourite concerts of my career and I fell in love with the piece as did most of the orchestra. Unfortunately the audiences did not seem to enjoy the piece.

990030,0,t3_25eb8u,I sympathise to some extent with your argument but I noticed one or two things regarding the tone of the piece and some of the points you make.  Please dont take what I say as hostility I dont have much background in music other than knowing what I like. Personal perspectives and all that.Regarding the tone gt...This is just one of many recent reminders that music as a form of education and as an art form is hugely underestimated and undervalued by our politicians and largely school leaders.Youre asserting musical worthiness right at the start before youve made any of your points. gtWe exist in a society with which music is completely intertwined.  Every society literate or not has music.  Music is an integral part of our lives  we are sung nursery rhymes from the day we are born...Good point. However language also pervades our culture and so do the various sciences. Again youre asserting an opinion before youve talked about what puts music ahead of the pack.gtMusic encompasses along with other art forms what it is to be human.  It documents the human condition in a way that no scientific study can and allows us to develop in ways we could never otherwise achieve. Maybe this is just my own irritation at this sort of mentality but I dont think you should delve into anthropology while dismissing the scientific method.  gtYet funding continues to be cut music continues to be pushed ever further to the sidelines in schools and we move further and further away from a society that might truly call itself educated.A musician implies an appreciation of music makes a person educated. Quelle surprise. Im sure the folks at CERN might suggest that its particle physics. The truth as ever probably lies somewhere in the middle but the likely impression here I dont think helps you.gtI recently read about how in Ancient Greece the foundation of western culture a word did not even exist for music.I personally found this bit an interesting insight in to a small part of ancient Greek culture. However again I fear the perception here will again be an academic going on about that old chestnut Greece and eyes are rolled again. It may pertain to their culture but it does not apply to ours and so this is for lack of a better word a hypothetical description.On to some of the points. Again this is just what jumped out at me and thus I realise it is entirely possible I may in places have caught the wrong end of the stickgtI have learned so much more about the world I live in and the people that fill it through the practise and study of music than I have from any more academic or core curriculum subject. I never had much aptitude for music myself but I did in Physics and so when I see for instance an arch I can comprehend the forces involved their magnitude and their direction entities not visible to those without the relevant education. I suspect we share the same feeling of wonder of how our specialist subject integrates into our world but the perspectives are still very different and I would not dream of suggesting that its worth trying to get everyone to see physics as I do. Intuition comes in which Ill address later.gtAlso it has always struck me as odd that a subject like English which at GCSE level so quickly becomes an art based subject  the study of texts and poems etc is deemed so essential to young peoples education. Good point particularly as its an established cornerstone of our education system.gtSurely at that level music and English literature are one and the same  the study of art.  Dont get your hopes up. If my English education was anything to go by then all you do is read some mediocre poetry and analyse it by pointing out that a character is wearing blue socks and is therefore feeling melancholy or something. gtPersonally music has allowed me a window into my own consciousness. It is what measures me drives me and holds me back. This is all very figurative here. If you were intending to persuade someone as to the worth of music this bit may sound rather ambiguous. gtIt has been almost solely responsible for my socialisation and entirely responsible for any skill at empathy I may have.  I think this is probably very personal given how many others have no such musical education yet do not lack empathy. Whether or not it helps probably affects the same people for whom it has special meaning.gt... Music is not a luxury for a select few gifted instrumentalists it is a fundamental element of life.  It surrounds and encapsulates us...Music is indeed not restricted in who can enjoy it but if it takes an education to appreciate it at a higher level then it is probably subject to the whims of who has an intuition for it or not. For me this is the nub of the matter it is largely fruitless trying to teach people the intricacies of a subject in which they have neither interest nor intuition. Education costs money and there must be an appropriate ratio of benefit.By the way just a couple of typos here which I thought would be helpful to point out as these sorts of things can slip through proofreading. gtIt is odd how much society has changed in its relationship to music over time.  Music is something that has an affect on close to every single person on the planet.  Has an effect noun form. It affects verb us i.e. it has an effect on us. gtMusic allows me to see who I am but how I react and allows me to grow by learning more about the artwork.Do you mean ...not to see who I am...?Other than my pedantry I personally think that anything that furthers the debate such as this blog post helps particularly where there is no public bandwagon for the government to jump on here.

2064974,0,t3_2ihhjo,I think the biggest similarity between the two lies in the prioritization of virtuosity and the performeraudience dynamic.  Most other rock genres are much more participatory aesthetically.  Being a punk virtuoso makes you a bad punkrocker.  Good punk rockers stick to simple chord progressions that are loud jangly and get the crowd going.  But a shredder on the guitar is totally inline with the values of metal.  The tone is clear so you can hear every note the audience is often supposed to just listen not necessarily jump in and sing along.  And I definitely agree with you about the nebulousness of the term classical.  In college we called it Art Music which is the most godawful patronizing name I can think of as if rock and hiphop arent even art grrr but its the most uniform and legitimized one Ive heard of so I usually go with it.   I think classifying classical by instrumentation gets to be pretty murky when you consider the amount of art music composers who use electronic instruments synthesizers and even electric guitars.  ,classicalmusic,cl2axur,5,t5_2qhyq

2470830,0,t3_2nulda,Ive played viola my whole life and to be honest the only thing that bothers me is when some goes Oh you play viola? Isnt that like a big violin? I just wish nonmusicians had the opportunity to hear the viola on its own merits not in the context of the violin.To be honest I think the attitude towards the viola can actually be a good thing. A certain crowd is drawn to the viola and you can generally count on a viola section always getting along. I think we also tend to ground the orchestra. Weve all been in that rehersal where the orchestra sits around waiting for the violins to get their act together. Ive never seen that happen with the violas. You could say its because our parts are less technically challenging but youd be wrong. Its because we take so much flak from everyone else that we have to be strong from the first runthrough. But thats truly a good thing. The rest of you depend on it.In a way the role of the viola is like that of the bass. They both are the less glamorous of their clef and they both are the most important. Neither gets the credit they really deserve but were okay with that. The orchestra needs us and even if they dont realize it themselves they appreciate us. Im not sure what made me run back to the music room the day we all picked instruments in school but Im glad I didnt go home that day signed up for the violin like I had originally done. I wouldve missed the chance to be something truly special a viola player.,classicalmusic,cmh3dnz,20,t5_2qhyq

2514257,0,t3_2odivi,Ive only looked at the first two screens on my iPhone but here are some suggestions. I like your main theme.  It has an elegance reminiscent of Haydnearly Beethoven. The quarter notecrotchet accompanying pattern is in danger of making the music seem rythmically stodgy especially where its in the bass e.g. .  It could be OK if confined to the inner parts.  For this reason I would suggest rewriting the cello part in bars  to be whole note G tied over to whole note G then whole note A. In general avoid octaves in the accompanying parts when theyre just filling out the harmony.  Bar  Violin I and viola.  Bar  violin I and cello. I would suggest putting the cello part of bar  a third lower G  F  E  D.  It then leads into the C far more naturally.  You could then rewrite the viola part for that bar to be consistently above the cello. You generally dont want G flats in a piece thats in G major.  They should be notated as F sharp.  Also E flats should be D sharp and the A flats should be G sharp at least in the first two pages.Hope thats helpful.EDIT  Just realized that you dont read music  sorry if this is incomprehensible gobbledygook to you.  ,classicalmusic,cmmr2or,3,t5_2qhyq

However it was rejected from the competition and Faur labelled it a failure. Quite a pity really.However Debussy contacted Ravel and told him not to touch a single note in the quartet. Its really grown on me the more I listen to more I appreciate it. It feels that every single note in the whole set belongs and plays its own special part.

Do you know if the previous finished version is available anywhere?Regarding the Beethoven yup. The Wikipedia article has a good summary of itBasically the opening of the second theme opens up with a bold statement of the horn in E flat the key the horns are in. The recapitulation is in C so the horns arent able to do it. He gave it to the bassoon instead which could play more chromatically but has a much weaker sound.But he had horns in C on stage for the th movement so if he wanted to he could have had them switch to that. But then theyre playing right before and never would have had time to switch. But then what theyre playing is just chords in a tutti orchestra so he may have been able to leave them out during that  to give them time to switch  if he had wanted without losing too much.Artistically he may have wanted the weaker sound of the bassoon to represent the heroic theme being weaker as the piece ultimately ends on a darker note.You can see the relevant bits of the score here The first picture is the recapitulation and the second is the exposition.,classicalmusic,cosfarl,4,t5_2qhyq

By your logic Pifa from Messiah is a symphony.Beethoven wrote  symphonies. Three have names. Egmont is not one of those names. Musical scholars and historians have accepted this as fact for centuries. Beethoven himself titled them symphonies. Note that Egmont wasnt even called one by Beethoven not once not ever. Just because a symphony orchestra plays it does not make it a symphony. Orchestras got the title symphony orchestra because they were playing symphonies not because every work written for them was a symphony.

I suspect that he had a fond appreciation as a saxophonist for the repertoire that included marches as supported by a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated  July  indicating that he was working on his Marching Song of Democracy and that he had found happiness whilst composing marches.Grainger made a total of  charity appearances during the war years many of them at Army and Air force camps. I think that he wrote the piece because of his time performing marches he sought out solace in the music without being pestered by mosquitoes and the likes! The theory may sound crazy but it does appear that in his later years Grainger sought solace in composing and all things orchestral.

There are basically two schools of thought with the cello suites the traditional th Century type brought to you by Pablo Casals and the historically informed crowd brought to you by Anner Bylsma. The traditional approach can be very romanticized with lots of vibrato. Bylsma uses gut strings and tries to give a performance closer to what Bach would have heard in his time. YoYos recording is nice in that its very much a middleoftheroad interpretation still uses a modern cello with modern aesthetics but he severely dials down the heavy emoting you hear in recordings by Rostropovich and Mischa Maisky.Pandolfos recording is an arrangement for an even older instrument.

3565628,0,t3_315ov1,Bruckners symphonies are harmonically dense and do not have the playful melodies that Tchaikovsky and others have. Also brass. LOTS of aggressive angry brass. If you hear constant loud horns over and over its probably Bruckner. Listen to any of his symphonies and this will become blatantly obvious.Brahms uses block orchestration. That is there are very few solo instruments in his works. You will usually hear all the strings or all the brass or all the woodwinds play at the same time. His works are quite epic sounding in my opinion but without the ponderous nature that Bruckner has. Give Brahms Symphony  a listen and you will understand.Most of Lizsts famous works are piano pieces so theres that. However his symphonic poems or orchestral arrangements of Hungarian Rhapsodies are popular too.Tchaikovsky is quite a bit different than Brahms and Bruckner. He uses a lot more solo instruments in his orchestral works and usually has lighter more playful melodies in my opinion. He is more melodic than the Germans who are more interested in rich harmonies. Tchaikovskys works almost always have a catchy melody. He also repeats portions of his pieces a lot more than others and if you hear a waltz its probably Tchaikovsky. Wagner wrote mostly opera overtures no symphonies. His music is very epic and if you listen to them they sort of sound like they are telling a story and they seem overture like. Listen to a few overtures like Flying Dutchman.Saint Saens is a bit trickier imo. Listen to symphony No.  to get a sense of him.

3693877,0,t3_32o02j,Glenn Gould wrote about fake Haydn years agogtSome months ago in an article in the Saturday Review I ventured that the delinquency manifest by this sort of evaluation might be demonstrated if one were to imagine the critical response to an improvisation which through its style and texture suggested that it might have been composed by Joseph Haydn. Lets assume it to be brilliantly done and most admirably Haydnesque. I suggested that if one were to concoct such a piece its value would remain at par  that is to say at Haydns value  only so long as some chicanery were involved in its presentation enough at least to convince the listener that it was indeed by Haydn. If however one were to suggest that although it much resembled Haydn it was rather a youthful work of Mendelssohn its value would decline and if one chose to attribute it to a succession of authors each of them closer to the present day then  regardless of their talents or historical significance  the merits of this same little piece would diminish with each new identification. If on the other hand one were to suggest that this work of chance of accident of the here and now was not by Haydn but by a master living some generation or two before his time Vivaldi perhaps then this work would become  on the strength of that daring that foresight that futuristic anticipation landmark in musical composition.Funnily enough one of Haydns most famous tunes the Serenade from from string quartet op  no  was written by a German monk named Hoffstetter who loved to imitate Haydn.,classicalmusic,cqdbrhu,4,t5_2qhyq

However he had a major aesthetic influence as well which drove much of the Romantic era. He kind of pioneered the idea of music as selfexpressive art where it was seen previously as more of a craft. He also pushed the idea that he was advancing the art of music especially at the end of his life easily seen by the fact that he published his late string quartets in score which was not the norm at that time so that they could be studied not just performed.

Honestly the only Stravinsky I really know down pat is The Rite Of Spring so Im not sure how much I could say about him. So you just made me go back and listen to B.O.B. and it strikes me as two things that . its one rap song that has no other like it like Lose Yourself by Eminem...I mean as great as Pacs Changes is there are other songs like it and . Its another one of those rare songs where literally ANYONE could have rapped ANYTHING over it and it would have been dope.Anyway as for the unpredictability of the beats I think youre right on. What I really pay attention to is the simultaneously entrance and exit of all the different ideas in the beat the snare the bass kick the claps to the right the synth bell things all of that. What I really love the unpredictability you talk about is the snares...they dont fall in straight th or th notes and they seem swung around the downbeat so that they dont fall right on it. Anyway you can never tell how many snares are gonna be ripped off at once and it just keeps everything so driving haha.Sorry these are just random thoughts hopefully theyre at least interesting to you haha.

4029850,0,t3_36nzxr,I really want to study this piece in detail. I know much of the humor in this is pretty slapstick and obvious. But I wonder if there are jokes that are lost on us because of how distant we are from this style. I know for instance that the part starting at  presents one statement of the material in IV Bb major and then presents it again down a step in iii A minor. I think this is a deliberate play on what Joseph Riepel called the Fonte which is one of the standard ways of launching the second half of a piece in the eighteenth century. In a Fonte you present material first in a minor key then you present the material again in the major key one full step below so you present material first in vi and then in V or you present it in ii and then in I. Mozart does the pattern here in its appropriate formal location but he gets the chords wrong and he gets the modal ordering all mixed up that is he goes from major into minor rather than minor into major. To hear a bunch of normal Fontes heres a collection of audio examples These are jokes that I think Mozart is pulling on his audience that arent as noticeable to us today because we just say Oh hes just sequencing that material without thinking about where sequences tend to begin and end and how they are typically deployed in this style. I wonder if there are any other jokes in this vein hidden through the piece! ,classicalmusic,crfmtko,5,t5_2qhyq

A lot of this public face of nice concert halls restaurants bars etc. is really so they dont get so hated by the west we stop sending them aidrelief. It is a step forward you can walk around Pyongyang unaccompanied now but I bet you anything if someone went missing beyond the city boundaries there would soon be trouble. This is a country that as little as  years ago we know operated gas experiments on live humans and who still has a policy of generational justice  if one person commits a crime very loose definition of course then the generation below and above them in their family must pay for it as well.Now as for playing them good music Im absolutely all for that. It may well help a little  but I very much suspect its the small intellectual elite of Pyongyang who will get to hear the music and the great majority of the population will be still left in darkness. Im not trying to put a downer on things here but I do think we have a duty to at least try to avoid inadvertently propping up the North Korean government.

The Russians have lots of fantastic concertos.First ideas which come to mind are Check out all of Rachmaninoffs concertos theyre all fantastic Lyapunovs concerto in E flat Major op  is pretty great Rimsky Korsakovs short but brilliant concerto is worth a listen Scriabins concertos are fantastic but I recommend sticking mainly to his first Medtner has great concertos too very similar to Rachmaninoff and they were close friends too Both Ravel and Poulenc has amazing concertos to offer and also check out Debussys fantasie for piano and orchestraIn terms of lesser known composers Amirovs concerto on Arabian themes is one of my favourites and I seriously recommend giving it a listen Moszkowskis concerto in E major is another favourite which could possibly be one of the best concertos around Balakirev has a great nd concerto completed by Lyapunov. He deserves much more recognition for his other works. Sauers nd concerto in C minor is great and virtuosic Palmgrens nd concerto the river is astounding and should really be listened to Wiklunds first concerto is really good though I dont know much else by him so Im guessing his others might be good too Taktakisvhilis first concerto in C minor Vladigerov of course has incredible concertos such as his th. Shame they arent recorded too much Scharwenkas concertos are all fantastic. They really define him as a great composer. Charles Stanfords nd concerto Percy Sherwoods nd in E Flat major Big fan of Tveitts first concerto Schellendorf has a great nd concerto.  Adigezalovs th piano concerto  Tcherepnins th concerto fantasie Gershwins actual piano concerto is really memorable and worth a listen. His rhapsody in blue is great and popular too. Dobrowens concerto Op  Atterbergs rhapsody op  and piano concerto op  are great as well. Always get the rhapsody stuck in my head. Max Reger also has a great piano concerto worth checking out Anton Rubinstein is a fantastic composer who seldom gets much attention.

My comment was about all composers not just modern ones I prefer the composer like Mahler who can take his idea theme and develop it in the incredible ways that he does to engage me both intellectually and emotionally. I think that the consequence of his thematic development usually has nothing to do with a tune but with interest in other areas gesture variation rhythmmeter harmony tone color texture counterpoint... its not often that a tune or even a moment of melodic clarity is the primary constituent or result of that development.,classicalmusic,cvtz4yd,2,t5_2qhyq

5384220,0,t1_cvztp1n,Ive never liked Sandow and this piece is pretty strange. He does a horrible job conveying his ideas and he seems very trapped in the theoreticalacademic world and sounds like he has never spoken to a working musician or been around working musicians in rehearsal. He is also smug as hell.The first thing that struck me is his characterization of music theory which in the piece at least maybe not in all this groundbreaking consulting hes doing is insufficient. All he talks about is chord names and the difference between addressing them by their function or by their name or at all. He says nothing about understanding key relations scale degrees intervals he dismisses any discussion of rhythm in relation to classical music since there are no grooves tell that to any conducting student learning Stravinsky or Bartok or to a young ensemble playing their first Viennese waltz or to someone studying a Baroque sarabande.... So thats my main problem with it. I also think he frames his conclusions in terms that are too absolute people who write pop music dont need to read or write music free heterophony like in pop music or jazz doesnt exist in classical where strict rules of counterpoint always reign classical students today play many kinds of music not just classical so is the classical performance artist dead?? music theorys only real purpose is to ensure the tautological superiority of classical music. Every single one of these statements can be easily contradicted yet he brings them up as absolutes.And thengtQuickly Id make a couple of points. First how well do students really learn the theory that theyre made to study? And most crucially how well do they hear the things theyre taught about how well do they integrate their theory training with the sound and flow of music and the deep discipline and joy of performing it? Maybe not so well. Which suggests that even on its own terms traditional theory teaching needs some changes.If we stop talking about students and start talking about working musicians and composers jazz classical and in my experience even musicians who gig with pop artists music theory in its current guise has a completely practical application as a common language that most performers speak not just in communicating ideas but also in expressing their appreciation and joy of the music.And then he doesnt articulate what sort of nonclassical branches of theory to study and why. All the extra jazz stuff is pretty standard most places pop music doesnt do all that much that cant be described by the language of music theory... so what is he actually talking about? Throwing in a little world music teaching students how to mix like an EDM DJ and how to use an FX pedal? To be fair good to keep it a mystery so we can pay him for his answers.,classicalmusic,cvzw7yb,2,t5_2qhyq

One day he was rehearsing a Beethoven sonata with his partner in the country house of a wealthy music lover. As they played they could hear laughter outside the door of their room. He finally went outside and found a couple of Indonesian domestic servants practically in stitches from laughter. They did not speak English so he asked his host to investigate why they would find a Beethoven cello sonata hysterically funny. The answer was that they found the emotional content of the music and most specifically its expression to be embarrassingly explicit. They recognized it for what it was but judged it to be totally inappropriate for public display. It was as if someone had held up a pornographic magazine in a church.If you know traditional Indonesian music its complex and rhythmic but also very cool on the surface.,classicalmusic,cxue4rt,34,t5_2qhyq

6087147,0,t3_3yxn9y,I love a very wide range of orchestral music including the periods you are struggling with. I believe the key is to recognize that music can express everything we feel from beauty and melodiousness to terror fear and the deepest of sorrows. To appreciate some of the music you find chaotic or schizophrenic consider how a good orchestral score can add so much atmosphere to a horror movie. Early in my listening experience I was exposed to Luciano Berios Sequenza for Soprano which I found absolutely fascinating as an expression of emotions. To many that work cannot even be considered to be music but more sound effects produced by the human voice. If you accept such expressions as music and if you welcome music as simply the art of making sounds to express the full range of our emotions you may come to appreciate less melodious and less harmonic music as well. I would never want to be deprived of the chaotic or schizophrenic sides of the musical experience. My favourite composer is Mahler who probably more than any composer embraces the fullest emotional range within his soundscapes.,classicalmusic,cyhi534,5,t5_2qhyq

The plot is there the characters are the same etc.  But when you colorize it it pops on the screen.  Theres more eye candy to look around at.  Ravel essentially colorized Mussorgskys black and white movie.,classicalmusic,czeaeg4,1,t5_2qhyq

7201417,0,t3_4e1gye,I live in San Francisco and study percussion here. The orchestra here has been pushing his music for a while and Ive seen the SFS perform his pieces over the past four years or so. For percussion hes doing some really exciting things. Its not the most innovative in that hes not the first to bring junk percussion into the concert hall but he has done it in some ways Ive found really interesting. Hes written some REALLY challenging percussion parts that I find to be tastefully composed. On a less percussive note I think hes found a way to include two things hes very good at into one pretty successful cohesive unit. At times his music can sound borderline gimmicky to my ear ex. BSides th mvt but even when I get that sense hes still kept the orchestra as the centerpiece instead of turning it into an EDM show. This is to say I think hes incorporated the electronics tastefully. I also commend him for performing his own works its impressive to see him do that rather than putting together a tape for the orchestra to accompany. I think hes on to something for himself but I dont see this becoming the new norm. Its very much his niche. ,classicalmusic,d1wqrus,1,t5_2qhyq

The majority of what youre gonna perform is decades if not hundreds of years old.  Jazz Piano is fairly theory intensive at first but it all makes sense i.e. its not arbitrary like some classical music rules you can tell with your ear if somethings right or not so you shouldnt have too much trouble picking it up so long as you dont psyche yourself out.  My personal opinion is that theres no such thing as high art or low art.  The only people I see call classical music high art are classical musicians make of that what you will.  Jazz is much looser in feel as well.  In classical music a wrong note is a wrong note.  Ive gotten some of my best jazz ideas by taking note of a cool sounding mistake and reproducing it.  Jazz is also muuuch easier to sight read.  Most jazz standards are just a melody line with chords that you fill out in the left hand. Granted those chords have weird positions theory comes in more here than in actual improvisation but once you get that down its not too hard.  Although that having been said as other people have been saying it might be worth thinking if youre sure Musics the right path for you.,classicalmusic,d4duwil,0,t5_2qhyq

8973573,0,t3_536mc9,Scores for moderncontemporary repertoire are generally priced high due to it being the only way for a publisher to have a chance of profitting. It is an issue of the amount of people purchasing the music. A work by Boulez or Ferneyhough costs the same to print as a work by Beethoven but so few people will purchase the Boulez or Ferneyhough scores that the publisher is almost guaranteed to never make a profit. The low demand for contemporary music is what forces publishers to make the scores so expensive otherwise it would be impossible to publish it in the first place. Companies that publish lots of contemporary scores are forced to take losses not because of the prices but because besides maybe  or  examples of composers whose scores are disseminated enough to recover publishing costs they will not get their money back. The only other option would be to not publish the music in the first place.Its a sad situation but unfortunately its reality for us until purchases for Boulezs scores start competing with Beethovens.,classicalmusic,d7qhkkp,16,t5_2qhyq

One time I was playing a piece for a student composers concert and I had to switch from bassoon to contrabassoon in only  beats. It takes about  seconds to make the switch to contra at the fastest so it was pretty clear that the composer new nothing about the instruments it was writing for.The dumbest part about it was that the contrabassoon part was playing in a register that is playable on the regular bassoon. ,classicalmusic,d7tzcmf,2,t5_2qhyq

No because there are many things that go into making a composer. Beethoven studied some with Haydn and Salieri but no one has mentioned them here. I am talking about Beethovens ability to influence his peers and write pieces that freed music from convention by starting the ball of the avantgarde rolling with such momentum that it is still rolling  years later.I could also argue that Bach is the greatest as well under different criteria though but you havent defined your criteria. ,classicalmusic,d915b1l,1,t5_2qhyq

If youre gonna be pivoting in and out of key centers like crazy anyway why bother to commit to one key signature? Not to mention I think a lot of composers get this idea that writing sans signature is more mature. Not that I think this is the motivation with film composers specifically. This is more of an academic thing than anything.Protip For the sake of your performers if youre writing with a pretty stable tonic just use a key signature.

This may be odd at first as chances are youve grown up with modern tuning but youll find that his music and all Baroque music when performed on period instruments breathes new life into the notes.Also I recommend branching out on your ownsure its good to go with what everyone suggests but more oft than not people suggest the same works over and over. He wrote well over  works a weeks worth of music. The typical works people mention to newcomers are barely a fraction of that. Cantatas motets passions oratorios chorales songs organ works keyboard works chamber worksthats the categorization. Some of his music is not as accessible at first some take getting used to.

10473203,0,t3_5pw7ie,In Pinnocks recording of the Nelson Mass the Credo is just slightly shorter  than the Gloria . It always depends on what the composer does with the text. In Haydns Missa brevis Sancti Joannis de Deo  Little Organ Mass the Gloria is  seconds long because the choir sings different verses from the Gloria simultaneously while the Credo is over  Minutes. In Bachs Mass in B minor there are more DaCapoArias in the Gloria than there are in the Credo. And DaCapoArias mostly take longer than a Chorus. I didnt look it up but it should be Laudamus te Domine Deus duet Qui sedes Quoniam in the Gloria vs. Et in unum Dominum duet Et in Spiritum Sanctum in the Credo.Additionally some verses Bach used for Choruses Especially the Et in terra pax and the Cum Sancto Spirito he deemed very important therefore these are longer as well.Edit In Beethovens Missa Solemnis the second most famous Mass? the Credo is a minute longer than the Gloria.,classicalmusic,dcv8upu,2,t5_2qhyq

Or in other words probably I was but it was better to stick with written text. DI agree with your point. With classicism period repertoir this should be sort of standart even today.

You started your post by saying apparently used supposed to and even said I think to be careful not to state an opinion as fact.  Its a little sad this is being downvoted so.I think where you went wrong was attaching meaning.  In academia its fine to discuss matters of tuning its historicity what composers preferred which tuning the string tension of natural gut strings but only as matters of fact.  Were not allowed assign meaning to any of that.  And were certainly not allowed to theorize that maybe human animals respond differently to different types of tuning. This is an anecdote so its worthy only of immediate dismissal but after college I had an apprenticeship with a woman who ran musicianship workshop basically hardcore ear training sight singing and more.  She had a piano tuned to  where she recorded numerous pieces on.  Over the course of two years it was pretty much unanimous that everyone preferred  recordings.  I should mention that when she played the pieces the class didnt know which one was which.  They were just picking recording A or B.   ,classicalmusic,ddbvi4o,7,t5_2qhyq

10758922,0,t3_5twlq3,Seems to me to be the classical music equivalent of Boobs or butt or shoulder? It is entertaining to be sure but unless you are paying very close attention or it is very obviously artificial as I found it to be with one of the examples then it is quite difficult to tell based on a  second example sung without any text. A few reasons why this is not a meaningful test Bach is an architect. His music does not derive its magic solely or even primarily from local microevents. His brush paints strokes of a far broader nature. He develops and contrasts ideas taking full advantage of every unique possibility each idea has to offer. Any music graduate can write a fourpart harmonization of a chorale cadence which could possibly pass for Bach in a certain dim light if you squint. So can a computer. The chorale format is not very intricate. Basically you have a given melody which has been designed to be aesthetically pleasing and three lower voices of which the bass is the most important. Im going off of the assumption that they fed real chorale melodies into whatever program was used and that if they had made the program write its own chorale melody it would have been more obvious which was which. When teaching people partwriting the rules are generally overemphasized but the chorale is a stringent form nonetheless. Certain things are more likely to happen than others and certain things are guaranteed never to happen. This can be implemented very easily in software but the same cannot be said of almost any other form that Bach utilized.  The text informs Bachs composition process to a significant degree. With text it would be clear if the choice of harmony was artificial or genuine dare I say even if you dont speak German.All that being said I have no confidence that the computer would ever be able to come close to the really special chorales of Bach even if it manages to be somewhat convincing among the generic chorales.,classicalmusic,ddppbx1,11,t5_2qhyq

Bad news thats not how language works there are no authorities who get to decide for everyone and language dont logic. That you think it does is a far worse crime against language and music than the fact that the vast majority of people use the word song to refer to all music.All words in English have multiple meanings. Some definitions are standard in some contexts and other meanings are standard in other contexts. That is the nature of language. When among colleagues Im a professional classically trained composer I use song as the way youve prescribed. Elsewhere I use the meaning you are railing against.
