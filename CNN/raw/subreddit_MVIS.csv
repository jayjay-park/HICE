8872832,0,t1_d7e3jig,Yep I agree a single even would help a lot. I was chastised for saying dilution would push it to a buck but here it is in the .s now for no good reason so we teeter on the edge.  They could buy some shares on the open market and give us a boost or they could dilute and send us to hell...hope they make the right choice lol.  Its a ways away from the next CC and no guarantee theyll have big numbers to offer even then.  Oh well Im going to sell some stuff and buy some more Mvis since Ive had to push my horizon out some more anyway.  May as well get the average down a bit when the opportunity arises.  I still think the twitch is  coming but I think the kickers will kick it while they can and its good kicking weather these days apparently because they are sure kicking.  Just goes to show how disastrous that last dilution timing was as we have yet to recover and are actually getting worse.  Timing is everything and they blew it.

That the markets arent reacting with a grander applause is just the nature of Mvis having been so close so many times and constantly whiffing.

If not then this issuance is a slap in the face to current investors just check the share price at the end of trading tomorrow.

10012872,0,t1_dbciiua,lumens are lumens is of course true. The problem is one side is saying lumens arent really the important thing just the language we have available to us at the moment to have the discussion. This is hardly unusual in a transition phase.

10034616,0,t1_dbfibpl,Yeah but nothing he said isnt true.  Two dilutions back to back can only read one way to folks not familiar with us.  His numbers are correct and big money cant come aboard until we hit  and how does he do that RS?  That is how the street reads it and Tokman hasnt moved the tute numbers in a long long time.  We do the shows but lose tute investors goes down after the conferences every year.  He is ignoring the insider buys and the last CC but who trusts Tokman besides us longs?  We need real news to change the attitude this guy has and prove we are a growing company.  After all Sony hasnt made a significant difference and I had expected that would happen and it didnt.  I have listened to Alec for years as many have done and we are where we are for good reason.  The man lies.  There is a lot of distrust to make up for and revenue is the only way he is going to do it.  Years of silence watching the pps and company value disintegrate didnt help either.

11095214,0,t3_5yfu3t,your probably right hovering between .. for now...Up day down day...The one thing different is the volume...Saw a lot of early buying then usual take down.... as of writing...I think a war is on and shorts are betting against tokman again...Given his track record it seems like a safe bet.. Or is it ? This time around I think it will be different..Weve heard about too many applications of MVIS components... Im still of the opinion someone is loading there coffers for inevitable news.. Was hoping today was the day...Still a little over  weeks left in this month..We will get there...,MVIS,depmsh5,2,t5_3fgj0

The last thing I want to do is watch MVIS everyday for an entry point. If it drops to low . range Ill snap up some more shares. If it moves higher on news Ill decide. Either way  shares is not a big number!,MVIS,deq6ase,1,t5_3fgj0

11326166,0,t1_dffrqam,Bosch has talked about having Q  clients but an agreement could be under negotiation and break cover significantly after that. mos to a year after that even going by the announced agreements with Sony and STM versus other timings.You go back to Alexs statements about events that trigger IP discussions which was in fact a direct response to a challenge about a Bosch tradeshow demo last fall for a possible foreshadowing on what the timing of announcement might look like. Then you realize Sony ordered parts for Celluon in September of  but no license agreement until March . ASU Cast One announce at CES  but MVISSTM agreement not announced until November.  So it could be coming and who knows maybe it hits sooner than that for a formal announcement on the other hand it might not get announced until early .,MVIS,dffsvwp,3,t5_3fgj0

That second one is sitting there looking better and better all the time.  Some one is going to want that sucker real bad.  The world just doesnt have a clue how much its going to like gesture...but I think the oems do after that Lenovo presentation.  Id sure like to know what the show was like in the closed rooms at CES.  If that second engine showed half as well as I think it did someone probably decided on it right then.,MVIS,dfo07kr,4,t5_3fgj0

11515446,0,t1_dg14boa,Yes of course Sweets!  I think all thats changed now and the time lag is where we are now.  I think the new gesture engine will be the one the bigs want and theyve already seen it in action at Ces so deals are cooking now but until now they havent wanted to utilize Mvis tech and as Shock says for any number of reasons that have been kept from us.  We dont know what we dont know lol.  Personally Id be surprised if Apple doesnt start touching Mvis patents pretty soon and I think a mass market phone will be in the offing before long from someone...Lenovo?  Im just saying salesmanship or the lack of it hasnt been the problem.  I think smaller brighter less power consumption and handy add ons like gesture control have been missing and made the tech more interesting to Celluon than to Samsung at its present stage.  These new engines will change that and if they dont then all of us have sorely misjudged mass market tastes lol.,MVIS,dg19zsw,2,t5_3fgj0

11603977,0,t1_dg9lb0p,Appreciate the replies here...  I called Celluon and asked if I needed the update as I purchased recently from Amazon.  They said no.  That being said that is going to be my next step regardless.  I tried everything with the APKs and nothing is working right.   Netflix is the only one that will play consistently and the audio just wont sync.  In fact the only thing I have been successful at is MHL to HDMI to Micro HDMI via an older S phone.  That works fine.   I then have to hard wire an external speaker as the Bluetooth function has a lag and the internal speaker wont shut off.   Basically works as a projector without any onboard capabilities.  I dont know.  I think this is going back.   Ill try a bit more but am getting frustrated.   Miracast just wont work either.  My older phone will not connect at all.  My newer phone connects but goes blank at any streaming attempt.  ,MVIS,dgbbjh6,1,t5_3fgj0
