1017069,0,t3_25qjc9,My thoughts about this reddit in the first place was that people could post whatever they wanted and that we would use the voting system to keep the good posts and interesting posts at the top. But since we dont have many active subscribers yet the voting and posting system fails.Im open for suggestions.
