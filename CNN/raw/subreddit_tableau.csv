575934,0,t3_20psxv,How are your dashboards consumed? Does everyone use Tableau Desktop? Do you distribute a packaged workbook and your users use Tableau Reader? Do they login via Tableau Server? I have differing recommendations depending upon how you distribute your workbook.. Your link to the community thread is not a really good way of resetting a workbook but I need an answer to my question above first before I start.. Yes you can compare parttowhole. Check out the example in this link. Is this on desktop or server? Each filter you add will slow your viz down. Are you using a Tableau Extract? If not you should be. Interworks makes a free product called Tableau Performance Analyzer It will examine your workbook in great detail and explain specifically where your performance bottleneck are.,tableau,cg5ql4i,2,t5_2uolo

1447864,0,t3_2aorm0,Paging ujeweloree Jewel  as a redditor AND a tableau employee... I dont think anyone wants to take away from the awesome community that Tableau has on their forums but is there any interest in building this subreddit into more than what it is now?  Now it seems to either be used to ask questions that people post here instead of the forums for whatever reason or as one more place for Interworks and Tableau to post updates in addition to other social media platforms. Im not sure what everyone would be interested in but here are some ideas.  Maybe other users could either reply with which ones they like or reply with some additional possibilities? Ideally the subreddit could act as a type of user group.  I really love the local area user groups and I think theyre a valuable resource.  But Ive talked to multiple users on here that lament the fact that they dont have a local user group.  Maybe we could have reoccurring poststopics here that help meet that need?  I really like the reoccurring webinars that Tableau does  maybe we could post some topic ideas and let the subreddit choose ones that look the most interesting?   Weekly datasets?  or maybe biweeklymonthly I think it would be interesting to post some publicly available data on a regular basis and then everyone in the subreddit could use it to create visualizations and post them to Tableau Public.  In the three years Ive been using Tableau I think Ive only posted maybe  dashboards to Tableau public.  I find myself building dashboards at work that use Tableau concepts that I think people would find useful and interesting but I can never post them because they contain proprietary data.  Im sure lots of people have this problem and this could help with that.  The posts w the most up votes could be posted at the top of the subreddit.  Microthemes Some subreddits have dailyweeklymonthly themes.  I think this would be something very useful here.  If the current theme is table calculations people could post content thats related to that etc. Stump the chumps  To steal a rhyming phrase from Tom and Ray  have there been things you thought were impossible in Tableau and then found out that they werent?  I know that I have several dashboards that I thought were impossible to do in Tableau two years ago.  I think it would be great to have a thread where people could post their   impossible questions and have other users that enjoy a challenge try to hack through them.  TAMAs Tableau askmeanythings.  It doesnt have to be upper Tableau leadership although that would be awesome  I think there are plenty of zen masters and other notable people in the tableau community that would be more than happy to schedule an AMA and then answer questions about their perspective of using Tableau and data visualization in general.  Hell  I can think of  people that would say yes just to promote their new books. Sorry to ramble on but I think that its much easier to complain about a dead subreddit than it is to provide viable solutions.  So hopefully some of these ideas resonate with other users.  If they do let me know.  Id be more than happy to contribute time to helping start some of these things.  Or leave some of your ideas below as Im sure there are lots of great ones that never occurred to me.,tableau,cixrkp9,3,t5_2uolo

5468630,0,t3_3pywk1,If your data is too big to fit in an excel sheet is it stored somewhere else you can retrieve it a database?If not your best bet is to union all the data into one table.

If so connect Tableau up and query the data directly. Save your data to one large csv file connect Tableau and create a data extract from the CSV file.

Beta and wed love more. Specifically we need performance and load testing on the gamechanging feature Crossdatabase Joins.This new feature is exciting and powerful and with great analytic power comes serious performance considerations. At a high level v crossdatabase joins are similar to blends the joins are executed by pulling rowlevel data locally and joining in the Data Engine. In production environments this data movement can strain networks and local joining will increase memory and CPU pressure on Tableau Server.Our team has a couple of questionsWhat do real crossdatabase join workloads look like and can we optimize them?Will Tableau Server and Tableau Online crash under a load of expensive crossdatabase join operations?To answer these questions we need to see a good number of workbooks data sources and extract refreshes built against crossdatabase joins and simulate load against these joins. This is where we need your help. To answer our questions we would really appreciate it if you could carry out these stepsTest CrossDatabase JoinsInstall Tableau Beta  Desktop and Server.Try converting existing blends into crossdatabase joins.Joins are similar to but different than blends so some massaging is required to get these correct. Use the online help here for more information and tips on these conversions.With those crossdatabase joins publish them to server both live and extracted.If you have TabJolt set up for load testing try using it to see what the load times are for the live workbooks.If you dont have TabJolt try setting all the extract refreshes at the same time to see how Backgrounder survives under load.Take the TabJolt data and Backgrounder logs and send them to betatableau.com,tableau,d444bzn,4,t5_2uolo
