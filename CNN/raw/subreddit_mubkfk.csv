This individual extended the drilling radius from  ft to  ft increasing the well control system rating from  to  psi. This combination enabled the development of new fields that could not support subsea infrastructure. Building an Automated Drilling System Where the Surface Machines are Controlled by Downhole and Surface Data to Optimize the Well Construction Process T. Applewhite National Oilwell VarcoThis paper will describe the history of lean manufacturing and under what circumstances it can be applied successfully to well construction. It will build on the differences between project type and various ongoing business type of wells. It will describe where the opportunities are and where the barriers lay in the generation of value. It will also describe where manufacturing techniques run into challenges. Is There a Place for the High Reliability Organization in Drilling?In contrast to active axial load conditions burst analysis of axially constrained casing indicates that an initial thermally induced axial strain exceeding yield does not substantially reduce the burst pressure. Case Study on Bottomhole Assembly Tool R. This feature is not available right now. This paper describes the application of realtime geomechanics to a remote exploration project in a challenging field and how operations benefited from this technique. Automated ClosedLoop Drilling with ROP Optimization Algorithm Significantly Reduces Drilling Time and Improves Downhole Tool Reliability C.D.Bruun Statoil M.C. Herbert ConocoPhillips Newly developed drilling automation systems locate a computer interface between commands issued by the driller and instructions transmitted to the drilling machinery. Such functions are capable of faster and more precise control than that achieved by an unaided operator and thus can help drilling with narrow margins. To ensure that these systems work properly in all circumstances an advanced drilling simulator has been developed to enable testing under a range of simulated conditions.Successful Qualification and Deployment of a HighPressure Drill Pipe Riser in West Africa M. Horsburgh Cameron Y. Mfoulou VAM Drilling This paper presents a highperformance drill pipe riser product for intervention systems designed and qualified for the USAN Project in Nigeria. The solution was manufactured in  extensively tested and qualified prior to delivery the same year.Development of a systematic method for detecting mode confusion problems by model checking is central in this respect. The company chose an outsourcing strategy pillared on project management and worked wherever appropriate to minimize the number of contractors.
