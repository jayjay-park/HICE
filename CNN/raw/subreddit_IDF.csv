Always rely on yourself but dont feel bad or guilty if you get help or giftsAmong the obvious like towels socks and underwear bring toilet papers. Moist or not youll need it.Dont be ashamed to bring sunscreen. Youll be outside a lot under the hot sun. Depends on your skin you might eventually reach a state where you wont truly need it. But still better keep it just in case.Bring a simple phone not the touch screen ones. Phones tend to get stolen  and nobody is going to call the cops to take care of that. Nobody cares  depending where you serve.Boot Camp is going to be difficult so stay strong! It is the life exam that will test you as a person. Dont be influenced by any bad people or arse holes that might be in your group be who you want to be and influence others to follow your footsteps. Have a head on your shoulders dont wait for someone to tell you what you should obviously notice by yourself. Dont be lazy.Additionally commanders that are going to take care of you  are just humans and might make mistakes too. Respect them as its their job to look tough and train you for whats to come hopefully never. Obviously out of military life they are just like you and me Learn to sleep everywhere in every condition. It will come naturally.Are you coming alone? That means youre a lone soldier. You have the right to get help from the state to ease your life and experience in the military.It will become more obvious when youll get into service but I think this is the most generalized tips I can give and hints of whats to come.,IDF,d3q8y6e,2,t5_2r517

11444289,0,t1_dfsursw,Its pretty unlikely. It costs them quite a bit of money to test for just weed which they will at some point so I doubt theyll do tests for other substances unless youre applying for something very high up. Your best bet either way is to not have any commonly tested for drugs in your system during your applicationfirst few months of service.,IDF,dft77fq,1,t5_2r517
