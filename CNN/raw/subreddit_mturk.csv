Sometimes we have cartoons we usually have educational lectures and news broadcasts and sometimes we have celebrity interviews.  But you already knew that.Anyway we have great news!

403899,0,t1_cfmlvg0,Since Zingy isnt online right now Ill chime in for the moment. The donations cover hosting expenses. Currently there is no AdSense set up so the site is barely monetized and brings in very little from ads pennies a day.When MTG first launched a lot of the upfront expenses like the vbulliten license were attained through community donations as well as contributions from Zingy himself. The site experienced a bump in traffic when other worker forums went down for extended periods which soon overwhelmed the servers and caused MTG to go down too. Zingy dumped more money in to upgrade the hosting for Grind to handle the new traffic. The donations collected so far have been used to keep the site up and running.I dont see it as shady or dishonest as no one is being forced to donate anything and all it takes to have full access of the site is a one time registration.Since Im not an admin on the site I cant give you exact costs and figures but Im sure Zingy will have more to add whenever he gets back online. I agree that a post explaining what the donations go towards would be helpful to address the concern you raised and I dont see why he wouldnt be willing to make one. Weve only been an active mturk community for a few months now so were still working on building content and ironing out details.,mturk,cfmmpf6,5,t5_2qmd7

561163,0,t1_cg41uvv,Thats fine no worries thats your decision. Im a Canadian mturker and probably  of the highpaying hits that people rave about here or that get posted on hitsworthturkingfor are US only. Crowdsurf is in my opinion one of the few decent requestors available to nonAmerican turkers and they are honest never issue unfair rejections without explanation and are very good at communicating by email responding to questions have clear guidelines etc. The pay isnt fantastic I suppose but its not all that bad you get very fast at transcriptions as you go along and it beats a lot of other stuff on there like crowdsource or productrnr which is pennies for more time. As a nonAmerican Im not  going to be able to or even expecting to make  a week on mturk like some people boast Im happy if I make an extra  per week so that I can save up to buy myself something I might not afford otherwise currently saving up for a new sewing machine on amazon and crowdsurf hits are fast and easy for me to do while Im not busy at my desk at work or even during commercial breaks inbetween tv shows. So to each their own.I suppose if I had better options available I might no crowdsurf either but out of the hits I have available to me they are some of the best. Is there something you would suggest that offers nonslave wages that isnt limited to US only?,mturk,cg426s0,6,t5_2qmd7

936548,0,t1_chaqbqb,Exactly right. While a survey might allow a single task per worker or a transcription might be a single task that all workers are competing for batches are HITs where there are hundreds even thousands available and a worker is able to work on them over and over until it dies out reaches its limit of available tasks.Usually these are data entry google search HITs data mining email look ups categorization or photo moderation tasks but any HIT where you are allowed to complete more than one instance of the task is technically a batch.,mturk,chaqoc2,4,t5_2qmd7

That isnt many but Id rather have  rejections out of  for a  approval rate than  out of  for a  approval rate.TO will be very helpful to steer you away from the bad risks but you also need to get used to how some requesters work what they expect etc. and it might take a couple of rejections to learn that.

If the R box is green then you have done a HIT form that requester before.  If the T is green then you have done a HIT with that same name before.  Otherwise the boxes will be red.Back to your original question of blocking the HITs.  In the first column after the requesters name there are also R and T boxes.  Clicking these will either add the requester name R or the HIT name T to your block list.  Keep in mind that this will only block the HITs based on the requester and HIT names.  This means that if there are multiple HITs from different requesters with the same name  they will all be blocked.Thats the best answer I can give you.  I know that there are specific scripts for blocking requesters but Im not sure if they prevent them from showing up in HitScraper.,mturk,cof5d6h,2,t5_2qmd7

You can look at a set of questions and understand that if Age has a text box you type it in if it has a dropdown you select your range or if it has radio buttons you click them. Scripts dont work like that they would need a separate set of conditions for every possible variation of question and answer.Thats also assuming requesters have some standard way of asking the questions. But some ask Age some ask Birth year some ask Age numbers only and thats just the label the input will have some weird autoassigned name from qualtrics that is unpredictable.So for any one item you would have to Determine what demo is being asked Determine what format the answer needs to be in radio drop down text box Figure out the possible answers type it in radio button drop down etc Figure out what the ranges are Attempt to match that with information stored by the user Figure out how to properly select the answer click radio button select drop down that weird textbox thing Correctly answer the question.Each one of those points has the potential to randomly answer things on other surveys in weird places just because they match somehow.In other words Its what  questions? Age sex education income   race that weird ladder question I think thats it...Just fill them out.

One they have an occasional glitch where the hit wont reload on Mturk where you can literally lose hours of work and cant pick it up again. The website is stable and clean and works flawlessly. Do not worry about waiting for acceptance. I actually find the website to be much faster  still you have to remember that your finished transcript is turned into a hit that their reviewers have to pick up and review so it can be a hot minute. Usually only lasts a day or two.

3715443,0,t1_cqfqf1f,My first thought was google as well since I got my first Captcha from them in the past week or so after about  hits in  minutes. But this is not the case. The box does say Captcha but there is no scrambled word just a box to click and say Im not a robot and also says sorry for the interruption if you click Im not a robot you will back to work within seconds. It comes up even before you ever see google like  as soon as you Accept the hit and then again upon submitting it on the Mturk page and getting a new one it comes up again. Just a thought.. maybe its designed to slow you down before getting to google again as fast to keep Google off their arse. It actually does nothing to slow the hit itself down like all their other trickery they come up with does. Once youre on google it goes just as fast. Its getting to google and the next hit through this click a box capatcha. What makes me laugh is the Sorry for the interruption in the box when CS is the one causing it on every hit. How is that sorry? A honest statement would be We are not in the least sorry for this interruption and will continue doing it over and over and.....  LOL  Now thats honesty and at least believable.

3791068,0,t3_33tn4i,Just to add a couple tips to this.If you start piling on lots of scripts its handy to disable any that arent in immediate use. Otherwise TamperGreasemonkey will be loading every single script before loading the page and can slow you down and cause max page request errors. Also some scripts interfere with each other so disabling any not in immediate use can help prevent that.Also want to add a couple general use scripts to your list that I find particularly helpful for batch HITs and keep active most of the time. Scroll To WorkspaceSnaps you right to the accept button or the iframe if youve already accepted to help prevent having to scroll. Works really well for batch HITs especially since it puts the iframe in focus so you can easily start inputing within the work area and any additional tabs of the HIT will be ready to work on as soon as you tab over. TurkmasterFairly easy to use script that allows for monitoring requesterssearch terms and running autoaccept links for HITs. Can help you keep track of your favorite HITs or queue up lots of HITs from a batch that you enjoy while you complete other tasks. Discussion thread by the author can be found here on MTG Queue Order FixMakes you load the next HIT by expiring first in your queue. Usually you load the HIT you accepted first and if you store away longer timer HITs while working on a batch youll keep loading that long timer HIT instead of any of the shorter timer batch HITs you accepted. This script fixes that so you can load up on a batch and work it continuously from queue.

Allows you to copy the direct URL from google result pages instead of getting a redirect URL.,mturk,cqoeukf,3,t5_2qmd7

This kind of halfassed research and poor attitude toward the workers is truly one of the driving factors in workers not working for a certain requester or leaving the platform as a worker altogether.  It also depends on whats going on.  My lowest point was when I spent half an hour on a  bubblehell style survey.  On the other hand I was lucky enough to catch that  Christopher Jackson survey a few weeks back.  It took an hour.  Thats the most Ive ever made in one day on mTurk my highest point.The point Im framing here is that if you have the patience for it hang in there.  Requesters suck sometimes.  Tenacity and consistency is the best thing to help out with this.  Im officially leaving mturk its messing with my sleep and happiness so good luck to you newer folks.

There was a  minute timer and I thought Hey I can figure out how to do this in an hour. So thats what I did and I did a bunch of them. Why not? Everybody wants money right?

5467545,0,t3_3prxdp,Use these settings on Hit Scraper . Put the delay on  or  seconds at most.  The good HITs are gone in a few seconds so any longer and you are probably missing a lot.. Put the ding on so you dont have to constantly stare at the screen.  That way you can do other HITs or even watch Netflix or something and not have to worry about missing a HIT.. The second you hear the ding accept the HIT.  Over time you will start to learn what HITs to not bother accepting but any kind of survey I will usually accept.. I know those . and  surveys are preferable but it is those lesser paying surveys that will really start getting your numbers up.. I know people say that .minute is the standard but unless it is a busy day I really suggest excepting most every survey unless it is obviously really bad.  I would accept a . that takes  minutes or a . that takes  minutes.  I know that equates to hr or so but a lot of the time you will be sitting there not doing any survey so making that little bit is way better than not doing anything.. TO is very helpful but any unless something looks really fishy I am fine with any requester with around a  TO or higher.  Sometimes even if is is lower I will just check their TO profile and read the comments and a lot of the time it was one bad survey or batch that caused the bad rating.  Also consider accepting surveys with no TO.  Some people might say it is risky but I have done several  surveys that take a few minutes from requesters with no TO and it worked out fine. . I generally dont bother with batches.  I might do one if I happen across a really good paying one but I really never do them.. I occasionally check HWTF and other forums to see if there is any HITs that I missed but honestly it isnt necessary if you are using HIT Scraper.. I have found that weekdays are way better than weekends.  I dont want to work everyday so I generally just work Monday through Friday and take the weekends off.  If I want to make an extra  I might work on the weekend but I dont think it is worth it unless you need extra money for bills or something.. I usually work ampm Central.  Those are the best hours to do surveys.  A few surveys are posted after that but from about pmam there is hardly anything posted.. I should mention that I am pretty fast at surveys so maybe your numbers could be a bit lower but based on survey times of other people I am not that much faster than average.. Try to get to  HITs approved.  I just got to  and it really isnt much different but  was definitely a bit of a boost.. Dont be afraid to return a HIT.  I have  HITs approved with  rejections.  Obviously a few rejections here and there wont hurt but I always play it safe.. If you havent already put your mTurk ID as a bookmark folder in your bookmarks bar.  That way all you have to do is right click rename and then copy.  There are scripts that do similar things but I could never get them to work and it is handy to have your ID handy at all times. ,mturk,cwaj3ry,2,t5_2qmd7

I am attempting to work on the latest batch however and I havent gotten any approvals or rejections yet but its only been a day or two.  In case you dont know yet this batch has a popup at the end that prevents you from submitting when it detects too many similar phrases.  Not sure what the threshold for similar phrases is or what number triggers the popup it would be great to know that ahead of time and Im looking at the reqeuster HARD right now but I would guess it is something like  similar phrases referencing the same subject or maybe  similar phrases total.  I dont know but I spent  minutes correctingrevising phrases on a HIT with a dude in a yellow and black jacket snowboarding on a snowcovered hill today.  There was nothing in the image except the dude his goggles his black gloves his black pants his jacket the snowboard the snow a barely visible mountain peak and the cloudless blue sky.  Had to come up with  phrases and at least  sentences referenced the black gloves and at least  more referenced the black pants.  Id suggest you get as creative as possible on the images with very few objects from the jump so you dont have to go back and try to figure out which phrases you need to change and how many in order to successfully submit.  Apparently the VG people prefer relatively nonsensical phrases man has pants pants are on man leg is black x  pants on a torso man is wearing etc. over similar phrases.  Actually that would totally explain why they accepted  million completely ridiculous sentences on the . batches wouldnt it?  So yeah I guess the lesson VG wants us to learn is that at least for them shitty and nonsensical work gets approved and paid whereas good coherent work is often impossible to submit at best and might be rejectedgo unpaid at worst.  Huh.  Backwards sort of thing isnt it?  Afterthought...  I love that they took the time to implement the popup message to prevent submission but failed to take the time to make a few tweaks to make these HITs less frustrating and easier to complete e.g. like the one in the DEMO VIDEO!.  Couple this with the fact that they apparently also failed to take the time to communicate with workers who received rejections and...  Yeah I cant say anything else without violating multiple rules.,mturk,cxhbjpv,1,t5_2qmd7

5990680,0,t1_cy4nxen,gt Attaching a keyboard is what messes things up.Maybe Im misunderstanding but  how about a separate wireless keyboard for your laptop? Im guessing a MacBook can use one of those.Im on Windows but basically thats what I have  a laptop with a wireless solar keyboard Logitech K which is wonderful BTW that came with a universal controller that also runs a wireless mouse also Logitech. And I have a  flat screen monitor plugged in as well so its almost like a desktop system. It sounds like the monitor is the biggest issue for you but if you could get a keyboard you could position any way you want that might help. And if you cant use a separate mouse there are keyboards that come with mouse pads.And as someone else mentioned some tablets also come with detachable keyboards or have bluetooth capability. You have an iPad surely they have bluetooth? Could you get a bluetooth keyboard?Those are just my thoughts... Feel free to ignore them if they dont work for you.,mturk,cy4wqkl,1,t5_2qmd7

Do you mean HIT DB?gt  is there a way to see more than just the past  days of submitted hits? Only if you use a script like HIT DB that saves your past HITs.Also all a requester needs to block you from doing HITs is your Worker ID. Its possible that this is a research group who uses different requester names but shares a pool of Worker IDs and now wants to prevent participants who did one study from doing another one from the same group of researchers.,mturk,cyypsip,3,t5_2qmd7

6491697,0,t3_44jki1,No offense intended here but the best way to go about doing work with an unfamiliar requester is to do a handful of HITs and then wait to see how your work is handled. Then do more later if available. Of course you limit your earning potential initially this way but you avoid scenarios like this with a tidal wave of rejected work that lowers approval . You may consider writing the requester a polite note regarding your submissions were en masse rejected. You may not hear back but Ive found being professional and calm has lead to some unfair rejections being overturned. Good luck.,mturk,czqsg9x,11,t5_2qmd7

8434985,0,t1_d5vvy3b,Thanks for this.gt Playing around alludes to how low can I go. Why is that necessary?Playing around does mean that in some sense as in What is the optimal balance between running as many tests as I can for my budget the lowest end of the scale and getting responses of the highest quality? I mean I have  in my account right now. Obviously I could set up one HIT with one assignment that pays . That would also obviously be silly. So while Im in a sense asking how low I can go that does not mean I want to take advantage of people and have shitty rewards. Thats why Im here before I start running these things for real.gt Why not just pay for right answers? Think about it. If youre going to pay someone to guess whats the incentive to not guess.The problem for me is what if the user cant find the right answer? As in what if Ive done my job as a designer so badly that they cant find the answer without some effort? How much effort are people willing to put into that? If I only pay for right answers Im wasting peoples time when they legitimately try but cant find it. If I pay a base amount for trying and a bonus for succeeding Im giving some incentive to put that extra effort into finding the right answer giving me better data. Thats the balance I have in mind at least but I might be wrong.,mturk,d5vwuvo,4,t5_2qmd7
8446126,0,t3_4vb5e6,First I didnt even see it in the list of HITs I can do because it has a qualification test attached and so its not listed in my default MTurk HITs page of HITs Im eligible to do. People just not finding it may be a part of the issue.Second I completed the qualification test got the qualification and went to do the survey. It asks me to register and log in. I understand this is part of the survey itself but I would guess many workers would see this and close the tab because the MTurk Terms of Service say you cannot ask a worker to register on another site at all. And then yes there is the issue of the older Turkopticon reviews. The one that concerned me the most is the one that they said they never got a response from the requester when they emailed after the rejection. Whether or not thats true that would make me hesitant to participate knowing theres a big chance I wouldnt get a response should I have a problem with the survey.Between the combination of the above three things I think thats likely why youre having a hard time getting participants now.,mturk,d5xaxnr,9,t5_2qmd7

Think about that. If you have a business and allowed your staff andor other customers to treat    of your customer base poorly would you sit back and wonder why youre failing miserably? OF COURSE NOT. Youd stop the bleeding.Moreover if  people volunteered to help you stop the bleeding would you sit back and offer up bullshit excuses why theres a puddle of blood on the floor.

You can even send them a message with a link to the survey.If you put the eligibility requirements in the title or description some workers will just lie and take the survey anyway.,mturk,da2rhfw,6,t5_2qmd7
9705774,0,t1_da7gog5,Our AdultNetHITs Mechanical Turk account was suspended without warning. We tried to work with support to figure out whats going on and the last we heard our issue was being bumped up to higher level support who were supposed to contact us within a couple days. That was almost a month ago so I dont think well be getting back on MTurk at this point.We set up a system very similar to what we were doing on MTurk but with private writers. We changed the pay per task to be what we used to pay Amazon i.e.  higher for the workers. Though we are limited to doing payments through Paxum PayPal refuses to work with adult companies.If anyone is interested in signing up they can send us an email at supportadultnethits.com,mturk,da9g0rc,1,t5_2qmd7

Looks like hell overturn the rejections.Its funny how once people contact IRB in mass its a mistake or they have some excuse. How the fuck do you call people bots and say they failed attention checks in mass then say you had a payment issue? Why wouldnt you put a message like payment issue will be reversed shortly?I wish there was some punishment handed down from the schools on these assholes.

10343030,0,t1_dcfmseg,Im sorry  a day for many people is not a liveable income if its your only source. And after taxes? If this was a full days work your still making less than minimum wage from in most places. Im not trying to degrade anyone here. Mturk is a great tool for making some extra cash to help pay some bills or for stay at home parents like myself but as a sole source of income there are better options available. If you got a car and live in or near a relatively busy city you can make  an hour easily with Uber. If you have a good understanding of computers and other tech you can easily make  an hour doing tech support which Ive been doing allot lately. Im not trying to crush anyones dreams here. Just trying to be realistic. If you just lost a job and you need to make some real money to replace that income MTURK is probably not going to provide enough.,mturk,dcgfw3s,6,t5_2qmd7
