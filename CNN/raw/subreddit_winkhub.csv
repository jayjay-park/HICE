This should work whether you make the setting directly through the router or through upnp. By setting the port to a high value you remove the known port from internet scanners.

6454908,0,t1_czmz0oh,Intersting.  I knew some there were some IR controlled fans but didnt  know which ones.  The UI supports record and playback  as well as even recording and using the recorded code to look up the remote via a remote database and fill out the rest of the controls.  No UI overhaul needed   I think the main thing we need to think about with ceiling fans is simply how to control them ideally in a more automated fashion  aka what sort of Fan automation would you like to see?  Triggering by occupants seems like one function and triggering by temp or other parameters seems reasonable.  Mostly curious to see what you would want!,winkhub,czmza62,1,t5_35nt7
6496385,0,t1_czqmecr,The problem with using just switches is you are limited to the entire set of bulbs on that switch did any kind of automation. You can use the wireless device switch from levitton? Or the new switch from Osram that goes over the physical switch so you still have manual control if you need to reset bulbs but you can control any group of bulbs you want. Most of my physical switches control too many lights imo and I like turning half of or dimming a portion or using leds like a night lights and have them be red and dimmed with motion.,winkhub,czr9vpk,1,t5_35nt7

11575196,0,t1_dg81s64,In the Lightify app they actually have various scenes that include changing colors of the bulbs.  Things like cloud cover where it will cycle through various daylight colors to make it look like clouds are passing overhead a fireplace option where it would cycle bulbs through various redorangeyellow shades bedtime where bulbs would fade to soft white and very dim and then turn off.Theyre kind of cheesy but I liked some of them as it gave pretty good use.  I have six BRs in my ceiling and some other assorted bulbs so the effects were pretty cool as all the bulbs would be in different parts of the scene.There isnt a way to do any of that stuff without actually going through the Lightify hub that Ive found.,winkhub,dg81z3b,1,t5_35nt7
11610070,0,t3_65jffp,You can do this. Its just up to you on how prettysafe you want to make it. Grab an old AC cord I use old desktop computer cords but an extension cord will work Lamp cord etc. Cut off the female part not the plugs that go into the wall. Safest is to run the cut end it through a gangbox that you can pick up at Home Depot. Strip the ends of the cord will usually be braided copper strand and wire them into the relays square wire nuts. If braided copper it will be a pain getting them in there. If you cant get them to secure inside the square nuts go get regular twisty wire nuts cut and strip the wiring from the relay apart from the Square nuts and twists them into your new round nuts. Do this for the black and white white wires. Shouldnt really matter which of your extension cord goes to which color except if youre using a grounded cord make sure not to use the ground usually green wire for anything. If you are using a gangbox you can then mountscrew it to the gangbox for mounting. If you arent using a gangbox wrap the shit out of the wire nut connections with electrical tape so it cant come apart and burn your house down. Put the relay panel on and fire it up. ,winkhub,dgc0fhb,3,t5_35nt7
