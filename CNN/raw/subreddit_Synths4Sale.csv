11743105,0,t1_dgoppk6,The Ms are an amazing digital synth the Torcido is rich heavy distortion and the software that accompanies the Aira  modules is crazy. The case is rock solid and very clean looking. I honestly dont want to sell it but Im spending all of the money on my Discogs cart and I have a feeling I will be happy and complete when I get all the musics. Why Im curious would you want to sell it if it were yours?,Synths4Sale,dgr3zz7,1,t5_3cg0c
