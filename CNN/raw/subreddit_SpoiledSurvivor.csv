9240991,0,t3_56rhy4,I think that he sounds a lot more likely to be spoiled on Sandra based on those posts. But I definitely think Russell is super likely to have spoilers. If these predictions turn out to be wrong it will be headcanon for me that someone fed him false spoilers for fun.,SpoiledSurvivor,d8nd2i8,13,t5_3elfp
9266693,0,t1_d8qlzgx,i mean i guess thats possible. most tribe swaps last for at least two tribals before another swap comes. has there been swaps that lasted less than two? i know there were some swaps that came right before the merge though.,SpoiledSurvivor,d8qmb01,1,t5_3elfp
9734347,0,t1_da0nbro,lol if I were on the show I would totally throw out fake spoilers for fun... but thats just me tho im weird like that,SpoiledSurvivor,dacyy5m,2,t5_3elfp

10061171,0,t3_5ju4ot,The fact that this boot list correlates with the others means nothing since it came out AFTER. Everyone is attempting to claim smartguy as a credible poster and is leaching onto his boot list but it has already been proven false by the factual spoilers we do have. ,SpoiledSurvivor,dbiztqt,11,t5_3elfp
10138454,1,t3_5l4431,Next time try harder. It has been confirmed that Andrea makes the jury as he said in a facebook video that she didnt even want to talk to Michaela when she came to Ponderossa. Michaella also makes the merge and is banished after Andrea.,SpoiledSurvivor,dbt1mml,3,t5_3elfp
10322626,0,t3_5nb22w,Maybe the big player is likened to the appearance of the shark. At first the shark picks off people slowly without being seen. Then more people get taken out in a bigger fashion. The players know theres a shark in the waters but exactly who remains to be seen. Then when they finally see the shark the players know their target but things just keep getting worse making it seemingly impossible to take out the shark. Finally when it appears the shark has won the boat is sinking and all hope seems lost the hero emerges victorious and blows up Brad Culpepper. ,SpoiledSurvivor,dce4kb7,3,t5_3elfp
10388438,0,t1_dcli7ww,I dont know what your seeing sorry to say but it looks like a male endomorphic body type to me. His body must have undergone at least some transitition as he even has a hairy chest. Although something I noticed about the past season there were very few ectomorphic males and the majority were endomorphic Zeke Paul Chris and Bret which I feel like isnt typical for survivor.,SpoiledSurvivor,dclleru,1,t5_3elfp
10393153,0,t1_dcm03oc,I understand there are tons of transphobic people but these are returning players and they know how this works. Theyre not going to say anything transphobic even if they feel that way because they know theyre going to get backlash.,SpoiledSurvivor,dcm4owr,2,t5_3elfp
10412398,0,t1_dcmxebl,Lol got to protect the source or they wont be my source anymore. However in PMs I have provided some info about where the source comes from and how I know them. Which has helped some people see the plausibility of what I am saying.,SpoiledSurvivor,dcoba0u,1,t5_3elfp

10581512,0,t1_dd7clll,I do think OP has an understandable question. Tony Sandra and Varner are all obvious first boot types too. Theres a lot of schemers and double dealers on that list. You could even argue that Aubry would be first since she was the strategist on the season they would have just seen and she wouldnt have preexisting alumni relationships. But you may be right that it all comes down to pregaming. Varner Tony and Sandra will be doing it. Ciera didnt last time. ,SpoiledSurvivor,dd7egfy,4,t5_3elfp
10586967,0,t1_dd7yn4z,Not trolling. I just became a Reddit member recently. I posted all the info he gave me about Kaoh Rong on yuku last year at final  and got banned so theres no proof that Im any bit reliable yet. I just dont want to be  spoiled of the season myself but I would need to ask him if hes comfortable telling anyone else about these things. He claims that he only tells me because weve been online friends for a long time,SpoiledSurvivor,dd7yqad,7,t5_3elfp

10923224,0,t1_de6kdv8,But Ciera gained back the weight in recent photos. Why would she loose weight it panderosa where she has unlimited food and than gain it all back after returning.,SpoiledSurvivor,de6nkmc,1,t5_3elfp
10924622,0,t1_de4dfy5,The author would have been taking a wild shot in the dark by guessing that Ciera was the first boot. That tribe  also has Tony Sandra and Varner who would have been more obvious guesses. But they would have gotten absurdly lucky when Ciera wasnt one of  the  contestants who has been spotted in footage from E or beyond. Instead shes one of the  who hasnt been cleared and as of tonight probably one of the only . Doesnt that all strike people as a bit of a coinkydink if the boot list is fake? Doesnt it seem more plausible that the boot list is real and people just dont want it to be true?,SpoiledSurvivor,de6srd0,3,t5_3elfp

11021931,0,t3_5xdxar,Based on bootlists it is already widely believed that Sandra makes a swap. This picture from rsurvivor may be further confirmation. In this you clearly see Sandra wearing a Nuku buff. Whether or not its from the game or she just got one is not confirmed. However I thought this was too interesting not to share. Photo comes from user suedron.,SpoiledSurvivor,dehb0hm,9,t5_3elfp
11100678,0,t3_5yi23t,I wouldnt give this too much credit they mostly confirmed preexisting spoilers and added a few details that could be good guesses you could see on JTs social media that he looked out of shape before he played and who doesnt have a huge ego this season?. Interestingly if we assume its all true its easy to narrow down survivorthrowawayss source.  It has to be a jury member because they witnessed people having issues with Zeke at Ponderosa and Zeke is on the jury They probably started on Mana why would they go into detail about the reasons for the Ciera boot if they werent there In comments they said All I know about Michaelas game is... and All I know about Aubry is... so theyre not the sourceWhich leaves Hali.,SpoiledSurvivor,deq937q,6,t5_3elfp

Hah.Also a police officer won his season of BB so on the other side of things that could influence why he thinks she is the winner if he doesnt know who actually won.
