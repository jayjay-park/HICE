You can make multiplayer for most game types including MGR style ones as well but it shouldnt be the focus. I mean by ur speed argument why not make Kill la Kill a strategy game. Look at starcraft players they play so fast but that isnt the case for speed. MGR was fast no matter how good or bad you were at the game that should be the defining factor of speed in a game not skill. The main problem I think though with it being a smash game is frankly that there is alrdy a smash game why need more? They tried to make a new one with playstation allstars and that wasnt that great in comparison. The reason why I said why not make a mod of it is because the way you described it all that can be achieved with a mod. ,KillLaKillGame,ctasjql,1,t5_315w4
