6828576,0,t1_d0q5iey,I know one city had an apartment building new people would live in for a week or two before being albe to build just to reduce the amount of shit builds from people that would build a house and then quit.,civconcordia,d0qbi3w,1,t5_3cvca
6838686,0,t3_49fskw,Im sure we can talk about this like civilized people. We are CIVcraft after all. ,civconcordia,d0rgvaw,2,t5_3cvca
6882424,0,t3_4a0rpa,He told people that asked about my pearling that I created another civ and raided Concordia which is a complete lie. He is a liar and he has no proof to even back up his previous claims that he has made about me.,civconcordia,d0wfspn,0,t5_3cvca
8284352,0,t3_4swnyc,It should be pointed out that the  or  hardest shards will be impossible to survive in without a group of at least  guys in prot and may feature mobs spawning on peoples heads at any light level. And all players will be spawning in the  easiest ones if we want to get all the newfriends we need to be in one of those.,civconcordia,d5d3py1,1,t5_3cvca
8361960,0,t3_4lrt3d,I personally believe that we grew too quickly. We simply could not handle the large influx of new people. Perhaps we should lock down the city for a bit with our core group of players and establish the main infrastructure.,civconcordia,d5msp20,1,t5_3cvca

8655213,0,t1_d6ncq99,The only reason is the current government im not leaving either as soon as things have died down and concordias not the face of drama then Ill come back and resume whatever it is I do. definitely not security if dumbshits thought a trenchwall was a smart idea without anyones sayufinI moved a pickaxe from the farm chest to the valuable chest how scary. However I certainly have the bastion. Wanna complain I dont care. Concordia isnt using it if the guy who for some reason is within security but has no say in your shitty parliament slack channel as with the shitty trench idea.Hey you know maybe if concordia did nothing at all wed use their diamond cartel plan against them and our rep would never have changed. Ah but obviously the trench idea was confined to a few players with not much understanding of diplomacy or civcrafts audience in general.,civconcordia,d6nilne,-2,t5_3cvca

8693986,0,t1_d6s1ggj,gt with the parliament basically also acting as a large ruling council Heres the problem exactly.  We arent supposed to be functioning as a member council government.  We have an executive the PM who we in theory trust to handle the executive end of things.  Do we really trust our PM so little that we have to micromanage him with legislation for every little thing?  If thats really true we should just hold a nocon vote.Parliament is only supposed to legislate.  That means establishing broad policy then appointing an Executive who embodies that broad policy.  Parliament should answer questions like should we have a vault?  Then we should put in a PM who is all about the reasons why we should have a vault.  Then the PM should appoint a team of experts who know all about how the best vault is made and keep tabs on them while letting them do their vault thing.  There is no reason for Parliament to be two levels down into the weeds on issues like this.  There is a reason that the member council is an unusual form of government.gt This would slow us down and make us unable to deal with things rapidly.First of all I dont mean to say there cannot ever be emergency meetings.  Only that it would be unfair for members to be penalized for missing meetings that are not preannounced.But even as far as that goes I personally dont think there has been anything yet that couldnt have waited for a weekly meeting.  Last night we didnt pass anything so it might as well not have been an official meeting at all.  Wednesday we passed a constitution we all know and admit is full of holes and doesnt even include changes we all agree are needed so we are going to have to debate and pass the real constitution later anyway.  And thats still the only thing in five meetings so far that could qualify as urgent.,civconcordia,d6sdmhd,3,t5_3cvca
