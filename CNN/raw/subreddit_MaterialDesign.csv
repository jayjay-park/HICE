4272612,0,t3_39uspm,Looks really good but the padding between the cards themselves and the cards and the borders of the screen should only be dp whereas the padding within cards should be at least dp. See here under content block types.    The status bar should be on top of the nav drawer but this might just be an error in your mockup.    Instead of having the comic book covers with padding inside the app you could also make them fit to the borders. I think this looks nicer but it is a matter of taste.    I also would try a different color for the FAB and as an accent color generally because the blue tones are to similar. Maybe try an orange?    I made mockups to show what I mean. They show the correct padding between cards and the screen borders one version without padding around the cover  another with the correct padding around the cover .  shows the correct behavior of the nav drawer and  shows the cards layout in landscape.,MaterialDesign,cs78of5,2,t5_32bmk

4930127,0,t1_cufc4x1,HelloThanks for looking at the app. Hope it helped you.FlatUI is a different design guideline that is somewhat opposite to Material. It tells you everything is supposed to  be flat and fit seamlessly. Inputs from others are appreciated. FlatUI recommends some colors which are also included in the app for FlatUI lovers or people who want to experiment with both.You can read more about it here,MaterialDesign,cufzcvy,1,t5_32bmk
4938538,0,t3_3ihq3z,The color palette you get from pulling  colors from the album art results in a look which I would consider too muted. I would suggest pulling only a single primary color from the image and generating a surprising accent color.,MaterialDesign,cuh1jct,1,t5_32bmk
5096392,0,t3_3kt8o1,I hope this project gets released Im excited to test it. If it is good enough it could replace Polymer or Materialize CSS.,MaterialDesign,cv0b0n0,3,t5_32bmk
5465185,0,t1_cwa7lw5,Of course. I think youd do well to follow a nice spacing system for the text it looks a little cramped over there under the show thumbnails. Also you ought to follow the branding of the service itself with Netflixs custom icons and whatnot rather than Googles.But its a solid start keep going!,MaterialDesign,cwa89d5,2,t5_32bmk

6681592,0,t1_d0affzl,Thanks a lot for these suggestions! Ill definitely try to implement them. I would love to use icons but I feel that the wide variety of lessons combined with my lack of artistic skills would make this difficult. As it stands I feel a picture which a user can set makes a good substitute.,MaterialDesign,d0afohg,2,t5_32bmk
6686382,0,t3_473q6a,Icons like everyone else has said rather than pictures for subjects and I would be inclined to get rid of the right margin  bit of wasted space that wont make the UI feel cluttered without. Otherwise very solid. I like. ,MaterialDesign,d0axi1a,1,t5_32bmk

9572990,0,t3_5c1csb,Its a good start already but I wouldnt make the picture as card instead just make it the header of the screen like here.Also I wouldnt pack all that info so tight into one place it lets people see things without scrolling but I dont think that the room plan has to be visible without scrolling. Also maybe consider not using cards this also helps with spacing things out.As the others I recommend you checking out the material design guidelines especially cards and the layout section.Edit also consider scaling down the icons a bit at least the top bar icons. It makes it looks like an UI for Android autowhich I really though for a few seconds when looking at it,MaterialDesign,d9t2ebh,3,t5_32bmk
10357103,0,t3_5o3dp3,I havent tried your app so Im just commenting from the screenshots. Generally your app looks nice but a bit boring.    So a first few remarks regarding regarding Material Design    The nav drawer isnt wide enough. From the guidelines  gt Side nav width Equal to the screen width minus the height of the action bar. In the example shown above the nav drawer is dp from the right edge of the screen.      Also it would look better in my opinion if you would add some nice  picture for the top of the nav drawer. Maybe in the style of this picture  The use of the nav drawer for options is rather... unusual. I dont think it is necessary for your app to have a nav drawer.    I made a mockup to see if the app could be made to look a bit more interesting and inviting      Instead of separating the got to sleep now go to sleep at and wake up at into three different locations hidden in the nav drawer I put them up front prominently in the app bar. In the drop down the user can chose between go to sleep now go to sleep at and wake up at and the time input box will appear if one of the  options with at is chosen but not if go to sleep now is chosen.    I made the cards more interesting by adding a small graphic showing the time of the day when waking upgoing to sleep pictures for night duskdawn sunrisesunset and midday should be enough but you could also add more like earlylate night morningevening by placing the sun or moon closer or further from the horizon.  I also reduced the margins between the cards and screen borders to dp it looks nicer to me.  As a last point I added an alarm function next to the notification function to make it easier to wake up after a certain amount of cycles and at the right time.   Settings feedback and rate can be found in the overflow menu in the appbar.    Edit It seems the other person that comment here is shadowbanned. Your comment doesnt show up. You might want to talk to a mod about it.,MaterialDesign,dci1dpb,3,t5_32bmk
