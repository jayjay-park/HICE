If not add a small subwoofer that may make all the difference. Lastly upgrade your speakers to practically anything different. If you still want more oomph put an amp between the head unit and the speakers. ,JeepPatriot,cspb1m7,2,t5_2w9u8
6197298,0,t1_cyu2732,Oh youve had it for a while too sorry for assuming.  But didnt you notice the herds of Patriots over the last few years.  I got mine  and never say Patriots just liberties. But yeah Front suspension  seems to be the killer of this vehicle. When I got it ish years ago. I was told found online  that the  liberty and patriot were made in same factory somewhat on same lines.  They have almost identical problems.  Thats why they were built different places after .  Also I got clipped in the front end a while back and if you have any damage and need to replace front end make sure to get oem parts.  Because of the cars only being made one year in a factory that did majority liberties no aftermarket got a good mold so they are all very tight or dont fight right...  They tried to give me it back  times with two different aftermarket bumpers and one time has a screw through it and they just said it has to be like that..  And I laughed and the second time it was so snug on there it pulled downwards. ,JeepPatriot,cyu2eqs,1,t5_2w9u8

If you absolutely have to hold your phone up a bit so you can see traffic in your upper peripheral and dictate. Lets not get any unwanted dings on that brand new Patriot!,JeepPatriot,d807i9e,1,t5_2w9u8
