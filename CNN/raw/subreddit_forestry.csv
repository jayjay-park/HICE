3780637,0,t3_31vuca,Im just gonna throw it out there that you dont sell good timber by the acre. From your description of the property and having some forestry experience in the Ozarks I would say there were probably hardwoods in that sale that could net the logger many thousands of dollars on their own. So my instincts tell me you got ripped off on some level but not seeing the condition of the stand myself I cant really say more. I will just say my stomach dropped when I saw stumps over ft in diameter.Often times in this case whats done is done and you might not have any legal recourse because it doesnt sound like the area was cruised and marked prior to the sale to determine any real value or guidelines for the harvest so shady or not the logger didnt break any contractual obligations or cut over a sale boundary.My advice is to reach out to a forestry extension that should be able to point an experienced consulting forester your way and answer your questions in a manner specific to your area. Here is the link for the University of Arkansas Forest Resources CenterThese are common issues you are dealing with in terms of shady loggers and potentially shady family dynamics related to land ownership. Any consulting forester who has been doing it for a while has dealt with something similar. Definitely reach out to an Ag extension if this is something you want to pursue its their job to help you and its sounds like you have a fairly interesting situation on your hands.,forestry,cqn7xoe,1,t5_2s5wq

6519593,0,t1_cztisqy,Some wildfires have burned so hot that theyve effectively altered the ecosystem behind them.  In other words they arent necessarily following the same successional trajectory postfire that they had followed prefire.  This ends up being a large concern for land managers.  In some cases thinning is a preferred alternative before a prescribed burn is even considered.Ive never seen actual numbers that would have to burn each year across the US to be an effective management tool but Im sure were nowhere close.   A good start to better managing our forests would be to institute watershedlevel planning on longer time scales.  There should be public input in the development of plans under this approach but once the plans are agreed upon land managers should be free to apply best management practices to meet those goals provided they are fully meeting the goals of the plan without threat or fear of lawsuits.  In urban planning they have a process like this which is referred to as formbased codes.  The formbased codes are agreed upon by the community in a planning process.  When a parcel is developed the developed will submit plans for review but as long as they meet the agreedupon formbased there is no public review.,forestry,cztodp0,2,t5_2s5wq

9871097,0,t3_5gnfie,This year I was working in a remote area at the back end of Duncan Lake in the Cental Kootenays of BC.  We had grizzlies roam around our camp at night several times we would wake up to large grizz prints about m from camp.  We ran into bears several times in the bush but our dogs would chase them away we assumed some of them were grizzlies because they sounded huge running away.      The craziest encounter I had was driving home after work one day and seeing a medium size grizzly running down the logging road in front of the truck.  He ran for about m and then decided he had enough and stopped.  Below the road was a cliff to the Duncan river and above the road was almost vertical rock so he had no where to go we thought.  He bolted to the high side of the road and started climbing up sheer rock..im not exaggerating how vertical this rock slab was I would not be able to climb it. This guy powered his way up it almost falling twice and then threw himself from the vertical rock he climbed to a ledge that was beside him.    Ive always known grizzlies are powerhouses but after watching this guy climb that I have a new respect for how powerful they are.I have a few pictures on my phone of him climbing the rock I just havent figured out how to attach them to this post,forestry,dau86pd,7,t5_2s5wq

10581670,0,t3_5rhb2d,Not a professional forester but if I were you I would identify the species you want to keep and the ones you dont. I would approach this in a threephase processi First remove all crooked or rotten trees that would make poor timber thirty or forty years from now or is diseased or unhealthy. Also any shrubs this is important or large plants.ii Any tree of a species that you dont want goes first. Remove these young saplings not all though.iii If things still are not clear begin removing the trees of a species you do care about.The forest I have has greater spacing probably gt ft and is great for hunting. I would go with at least  feet maybe even more.As for larger trees they are not a problem so long as you have adequate spacing between them. The giant white oak of old on my property are typically at least  feet apart in all directions. With little undergrowth you can easily spot for perhaps  or  feet. I would not recommend felling the cedars.But again I am not a professional forester just an amateur observer of the woods. I think though that this is something you can accomplish without the need of a forestry commission. In the past year I have thinned a little under  trees mostly saplings that were dead or inopportunely placed.,forestry,dd7f1le,3,t5_2s5wq
