2432183,0,t1_cm5fmpw,Not a very good system.First things that are obvious not HD hence why it doesnt exist a HDMI port on the DVR itself.Also noticeable is the bad casing design around the IR it seems to be very prone to IR leaks IR reflecting back from the casing back into the iris blinding the camera at night.This system is good to guard something that you care barely enough not for serious surveillance.I dont even know what to tell you just dont buy this unless youre on a budget.,homesecurity,cmcbp2x,2,t5_2rs99

5780678,0,t3_3sb8jv,I think you must give a try to Korner Home Security Systems they provide a home security system that starts under  for first year and is very easy to install. I live in an apartment with some friends which weve taken on rent. We also searched for few months and got Korner and ordered online on A simple dongle kind of thing is attached in the home router to get connected with the security system and there are  Tags in the basic pack that you have to fix at the corners of the doors and windows and just thats it. It was really so easy to install this home security system. You can increase the no. of tags if you need to cover more doorswindows. You can monitor the intrusion activity at your smartphone by downloading their app.,homesecurity,cxdnbsv,1,t5_2rs99

6383131,0,t3_42zxg5,In my setup each of my cameras are a direct run to a  port patch panel. I didnt need to use a single point of entry as I have an accessible attic and each of mine are mounted under the soffet along the roof line so there is no exposed cable. Maybe a better description of the type of structure youre working with might be helpful.Edit IMO I would try to avoid going into a  port wall plate and then to the patch panel before you finally make your connection to the switch. To many points of failure to maintain. You should try your best to make direct runs from the cameras straight to the patch panel.,homesecurity,czf6z35,0,t5_2rs99

6639533,0,t1_d05nk0g,The following is from a technical bulletin from Honeywell dated March When planning service calls to upgrade or replace Vista or Lynx control panels using  sensors built before  it is likely that some of the pre wireless devices may also need to be replaced.Therefore Honeywell recommends reviewing the system installation profile prior to dispatching a service team in the event that some pre  devices older than  years will require replacement.Background In  Honeywell made a manufacturing process change to all  wireless sensors. As a result of that change some original  sensors older than  may not enroll properly with recently built VISTA or Lynx series control panels. In the case where a pre  sensor does not enroll into a recent VISTA or Lynx control panel Honeywell recommends replacement of that sensor. If a sensor older than  does enroll into a newer VISTA or Lynx system the sensor can be used normally.,homesecurity,d0632pp,1,t5_2rs99

8400674,0,t1_d5rgcvw,The monitoring company that you are working with will likely not be able to reuse the existing CDMA module unless it was unregistered or deactivated from the previous monitoring company.  Alarm Relay will likely need you to purchase an IP Datatel communication module part number IPDBATCDMAWIFI.  This model communication module will allow the system to be professionally monitored and allow for you to remotely control the system through a smart phone app.  If you want to save a few bucks on the monitoring and do not care about being able to remotely control the system then model IPDBATCDMA can be used for straight monitoring only and is less expensive than the other dualpath model listed above.,homesecurity,d5rmpn7,1,t5_2rs99

Itd be a pain to have  IP cameras that you keep having to reboot because of some weird bug they all seem to have.

10202580,0,t3_5m2gpg,When I had ADT the sales person was a liar prices were WAY more than what is available now for the same type of service. The equipment did work. And when I did go to cancel my service due to moving they informed me that the contract I signed was void since I lived in a state that a yr contract was illegal. So at least they were honest. With the times changing and DIY installs offering the same services at a lot cheaper price if you dont adapt youre going to be the next Blockbuster. Im currently with Link Interactive. Im not a DIY person but their customer service is top notch sales people didnt try and sell me anything I didnt need and the cost savings pay for itself over the YR contract I have with them. And once the contract is up I will still stay with them. Kudos for you reaching out to the people to see what they feel. I hope you can make a difference for the company. I never want to see anyone fail but when youre not adapting its hard not to fail. If you would like more information feel free to PM me. Best of luck!,homesecurity,dc0ipm6,13,t5_2rs99
