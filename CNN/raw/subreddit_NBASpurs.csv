732548,0,t1_cgniuw5,Look last year was nothing short of an act of God for us to not win the championship. No lack of will power or determination can explain it. The ball simply didnt bounce our way and that was that but I can assure you that last years team was the real deal. s team was just as legitimate. Ill never fully understand how we collapsed against OKC  straight games but a combination of them getting hot Ibaka going  or something ridiculous in game  some questionable officiating and us just running out of gas did us in but once again we were legitimate title contenders. I mean just getting to the WCF is a feat in itself and should be applauded.  when we lost to memphis in the first round was probably the most recent year we werent title contenders although if Manu doesnt have a broken arm Im quite confident we beat Memphis. The list goes on and on but I think the reason we all assume the Spurs are contenders is because we are. When you have in my opinion the greatest coach in the league  future hall of famers and an usually solid group of role players I would say that makes you a title contending team every year until one of those things changes.,NBASpurs,cgnjm4d,1,t5_2s53b

1219317,0,t1_ci5kgdc,Sorry but saying Duncan never played with another superstar is disrespectful and incorrect. David Robinson was an AllStar in three of Duncans first four seasons and AllNBA as well. He was still receiving votes for NBA MVP into . By  yes he was down to being a solid role player but he was absolutely unequivocally a superstar in Duncans first four years.That takes us into the Big  era. Parker and Ginobili have eight AllStar appearances between them. Parkers received MVP votes every year since  highlighted by a th place finish in . Six AllNBA teams between them. Parker has been a top PER player twice Manu twice as well. Both are firstballot Hall of Famers.Outside of the superstar unions PierceGarnettAllen JamesWadeBosh Duncans had the best supporting casts of anyone in his career.

He is going to have a bit more room to move should be able to get in the paint and knock down some elbow jumpers. But our role players will be better defended if the Heat ease up on their pick and roll defence.

2752996,0,t3_2rlezd,I still fully believe this team can get it together and defend the title. BUT for that to happen we need to quit using the whole woe is us weve had injuries excuse. Look I get it TP runs the show Kawhi is a beast defender and rebounder Patty the spark plug off the bench but enough is enough. Something I could always count on was the Spurs taking care of the bottom feeder teams. Maybe a flukey loss here and there but  times out of  when we went up against a below . team we got the W and usually got to rest our starters in the fourth. I mean these are the same guys who beat some of the best teams in the league even when we were resting the Big . I dont know what it is but there are so many uncharacteristic things happening at the ends of these close games and its starting to become a trend and no longer just bad luck. When you miss  free throws down the stretch and then turn it over instead of taking a timeout something is wrong. Like I said I have full faith that they can and will figure it out but if the reality is if this keeps up we are going to be fighting for our playoff spot come April and May.

Parker was that guy with his driving layups to the basket when a play broke down but this year seems a bit reserved perhaps due to injuries. This is why I love players like Jamal Crawford the old Jason Terry the old Jason Richardson heck even the old Willie Anderson. The X factors that can score one on one when the system stalls.

Kawhi scored at least  against the Bulls Raptors and Suns none of which have a LeBron type of player at SF. Ever think that maybe he went out the night before in NYC and was tired? Maybe he had a rough personal issue happen. Hes not a robot and can have offnights. Also when you say that the Big  and everybody else brings it every night you are making another broad generalization that is very untrue. Boris Tiago Marco Tony Danny and even Manu dont bring it every night. They take some nights off because its a long season.

Athletes are more or less a dime a dozen in the NBA so I wouldnt say thats enough basis for Simmons to project as filling that role.  Obviously Simmons is a good enough passer since everybody on the Spurs has to be but Id put him in the lowest tier of passing ability on the team.

This dude responds caustically to every perceived slight and cant find the maturity within himself to just play on without being offended and lashing out. The moment when we reached Peak DMC in my opinion was that game a few years ago where he was mauling Tim Duncan down low Sean Elliott criticized him during the broadcast Tim Duncan ultimately came back and beat him then DMC actually sought out Sean Elliott after the game to try to fight him for criticizing his oncourt behavior.

Were looking for people  and Ive said it many times  who have gotten over themselves and you can tell that pretty quickly. You can talk to somebody for four or five minutes and you can tell if its about them or if they understand that theyre just a piece of the puzzle. So we look for that. A sense of humor is a huge thing with us. Youve got to be able to laugh. Youve got to be able to take a dig give a dig  that sort of thing. And you have to feel comfortable in your own skin that you dont have all the answers. We want people who are participatory. The guys in the film room can tell me what they think of how we played last night if they want to. Former Assistant GM Sean Marks would sit in on our coaches meetings when were arguing about how to play the pickandroll or who were going to play or who were going to sit.gtWe need people who can handle information and not take it personally because in most of these organizations theres a big divide. All of the sudden the wall goes up between management and coaching and everybody is ready to blame back and forth and thats the rule rather than the exception. It just happens. But thats about people. Its about finding people who have all of those qualities. So we do our best to look for that and when somebody comes they figure it out pretty quick.Nonimage version of Pops answer.,NBASpurs,d09pv1a,18,t5_2s53b

8163231,0,t1_d4xxxv2,Good question. Has to do with cap holds. If youre a returning player over the average salary youre cap hold counts as  of your previous salary. Even if youre a free agent you still have something that counts against the cap of your previous team until you sign a new contract.    Duncan had a  M dollar contract in  his cap hold would have been in the neighborhood of  M which counted against the cap. So in order to sign LMA Duncan signed a M deal so he would count as M freeing up to  mil to sign LMA.    Manus contract in  was  M meaning his cap hold woulda been in the M range. He signed a  yr room exception which reduced his cap hold by  M.    Now that their cap holds are tiny they count very little against the cap. Last year we still had their bird rights but because they had large cap holds that were clogging our books we asked them to take smaller salaries which would remove those cap holds off the books to sign LMA and give Kawhi his extension.,NBASpurs,d4xya7y,9,t5_2s53b

It is imo a terrible thing that the jump in max salary was sooo large that severely discounted the contracts of most of warriors players allowing them to form a super team where noone made any sacrifices. This imo is worse than what miami did  they sacrificed the supporting cast. Spurs had the big three but we sacrificed salaries and supporting cast too.So I dont hate KD or the warriors  each made what they thought is the best decision given the situation. I do hate however Adam Silver and the player association for letting this situation large jumps in salary cap happen.

8693076,0,t3_4yxovq,Patty thrives in a penetrating guard role. His strongest skill is not running the offense but generating offense. This works extremely well when coupled with Manu as Manus size matches him well against other shooting guards and allows him Manu to run the offense whilst Patty can match up against the smaller faster point guards. Patty struggles when defending longer shooting guards which necessitates Danny or Manu in that roll.Patty should definitely start to get more looks as Manu handles his twilight year but I dont see Patty breaking into the starting line up. This isnt a strike against Patty its a lineup mismatch problem. Patty needs Manu or another offensive creator to share the floor with for him to thrive note Patty will be good without such a creator but he is better sharing the floor with such a creator.This is why its difficult to see Patty taking the starting role from TP unless we also swap out Danny for Manu. Swapping TP and Patty only leaves weak passing from the wings in the starting lineup.I hope Patty sees more time and I suspect the Manu and Patty combination will see heavier minutes but replacing TP with Patty creates other problems unless Pattys passing and offensive creation improves significantly.,NBASpurs,d6s9ihy,6,t5_2s53b

9378281,0,t3_58z6ln,The only argument Ive seen a lot of against who we picked is We have too many guards. Which isnt actually true. Parker rests often and has an injury history. Starting Mills ruins chemistry off the bench and the only other option is to have Murray start games. He isnt going to be ready to do that in year one and also no way would Pop do it. Tony Parker played  games last year that was a year high. We need Forbes to fill in the as a starter to bring the ball up but more importantly simply hang behind the point line. Kawhi will have the ball in his hands more anyway. So picking up Forbes is really just protection against the  projected games Tony is out for and as a backup floor spacer.,NBASpurs,d94rhzl,4,t5_2s53b

9398920,0,t3_59c0kw,GSW  Spurs        Heres my bullshit that I am feeling  Gasol struggles to find himself defensively.  Kawhi struggles to find himself offensively.  LMA proves he is consistent and ends up with mid to high s.  Parker has nothing.  Ginobili has nothing trys to force things that arent working.  Patty Mills steps up big.  Bertans and new guys struggle due to it being their first NBA game.   David Lee shows up with his  points and some small defensive plays that are overlooked.          Here is my legitimate view   The Spurs are going to just play the system work out small basic plays and integrate the new guys and it will be a game thats primarily goal is to allow the players to get an idea of expectations.      What I hope happens  I want to see Kawhi be double teamed constantly unlikely to happen since its the opening game but I want to see how he handles the pressure especially from  super stars in his face.

No matter what Trump says about repealing Roe vs Wade though Supreme Court decisions though are final and since Hillary would control the court via the multiple judges she would be the one to appoint shed be able to permanently expand the presidents power over Congress.

It seems like if you went high off the glass the rebound would go higher giving more players a chance to fight for it and ball wouldnt have enough momentum to come far from the basket meaning youll lose time fighting for the rebound underneath. If you only need  points thats fine because the ball will stay close enough to the rim to tip it in but if you need  I think your best bet is to come off the front of the rim. ,NBASpurs,df29ied,2,t5_2s53b
