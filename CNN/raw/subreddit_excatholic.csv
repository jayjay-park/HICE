565999,0,t1_cg4kh0i,I had forgotten the weird Adam and Eve bit but coming from a Catholic high school thats exactly what I was taught as well. Its just that I was taught biology and some mechanisms of evolution as well so it immediately didnt make any sense. As for how they were supposed to know it was bad before getting the knowledge it was bad I havent the faintest idea. And yeah once I left the faith it became painfully obvious that the devil in the genesis story is the good guy with god being a controlling prick with too much power. The sand castle bit is mine. Im sure my teachers from high school didnt put it like that. They likely would have been fired quite quickly ,excatholic,cg4lye6,1,t5_2sdlb

932725,0,t3_24lmja,I have been an ex Catholic for  years. My main issue is their idealism and lack of compassion. I was surprised at the Churchs reaction to same sex marriage and Proposition  in California. Growing up in the s I dont recall anyone talking about same sex marriage either for or against it. When it started to become in issue of public debate I was surprised to see Catholics being some of the main opponents.Maybe it was that I grew up in a more progressive place or maybe I just look at the world differently. I thought religious groups would be the ones leading the charge for a more inclusive society. Maybe its that I loved watching Martin Luther King civil rights speeches and figured other religious leaders felt the same way about expanding rights in society.This is part of a larger issue I have with the Church especially as an adult idealism. They often draw sharp lines between what they see as right and wrong then call wrong a sin or unworthiness. I still go to Mass at Christmas mostly to keep the peace with my family. I cringe at negative language. I dont hear much about we are all human doing our best give yourself and others a break. I did a lot of therapy in my s and found it to be a much healthier way of looking at myself and others.,excatholic,chab0dw,3,t5_2sdlb

1252540,0,t3_27oe2w,Never forget that there are only two philosophies to rule your life the one of the cross which starts with the fast and ends with the feast. The other of Satan which starts with the feast and ends with the headache.  Fulton J. Sheen Seven Words of Jesus and Mary Lessons from Cana and CalvaryAs all men are touched by Gods love so all are also touched by the desire for His intimacy. No one escapes this longing we are all kings in exile miserable without the Infinite. Those who reject the grace of God have a desire to avoid God as those who accept it have a desire for God. The modern atheist does not disbelieve because of his intellect but because of his will it is not knowledge that makes him an atheistThe denial of God springs from a mans desire not to have a Godfrom his wish that there were no Justice behind the universe so that his injustices would fear not retribution from his desire that there be no Law so that he may not be judged by it from his wish that there were no Absolute Goodness that he might go on sinning with impunity. That is why the modern atheist is always angered when he hears anything said about God and religionhe would be incapable of such a resentment if God were only a myth. His feeling toward God is the same as that which a wicked man has for one whom he has wronged he wishes he were dead so that he could do nothing to avenge the wrong. The betrayer of friendship knows his friend exists but he wished he did not the postChristian atheist knows God exists but he desires He should not.  Fulton J.

5816191,0,t1_cxi11fd,Well yeah I mean this was written when women were still seen as property for most cultures in the world and the Catholic Church doesnt change things too often from the original understandings. Its like that for men to when it comes to reproduction as well. Reproduction and marriage are seen as acts with one primary goal which is to make offspring. That is more important for cultures that have high infant mortality or low population anything with those acts that gives pleasure is a bonus but is not part of the purpose of the process. They saw the most effective method for procreation to be missionary position and that birth control and stuff went against the primary purpose of creating babies thats one of the main reasons that the parts of the Bible about marrying rapists are there.

Comparing your inner faith with the outward faith presented by others is not a good idea. If you still believe that God listens to prayers you can do this Privately and sincerely ask God for an increase in faith. Not a sign of his existence we wont get that!
