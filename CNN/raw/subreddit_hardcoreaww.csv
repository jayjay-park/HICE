2522293,0,t3_2oiqfk,Reading The Maneaters of Kumaon by Jim Corbett made me realize that tigers are the most efficient killing machines on land at least at a human scale as spiders are pretty fucking monstrous but theyre tiny and easily defeated by the sole of a shoe. The Champawat Tiger was the most prolific maneater with  kills. But this is a picture of a lion not a tiger. Why am I saying this?I went to Big Cat Rescue in Tampa FL. They have a whole bunch of tigers but they also have a lion named Cameron that lives with a white tiger Zabu They also have a whole bunch of other tigers and two other lions there. I went to that place knowing that tigers are the scariest sons of bitches on the planet. As I started walking with the tour group though Cameron decided to start roaring. We were heading over to Camerons direction and his roaring was getting louder and louder. If youve ever heard a lion roar you know its something that instills a desire to run away from that sound as fast and as far as you can. Instead we walked closer and closer to Cameron and Zabus habitat and I was eventually about five feet from his face while he was roaring. Even though I was definitely looking at the tigers knowing how powerful they are there was nothing that came close to scaring me like that lions roar. I think if they didnt make that sound they probably wouldnt be considered king of the jungle but they do and its scary as hell.,hardcoreaww,cmnsuse,7,t5_2uhb6
