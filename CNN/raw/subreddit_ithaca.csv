851955,0,t1_ch141wz,I dont live in Ithaca anymore.  I left for a relationship years ago but...I used to be Cornell staff not faculty...  I lived down on the flat part of town and I did just fine.  It was easier for me to make ends meet there than it was in CT or CA and I was paid more in each of those jobs...  IL was a little easier but not dramatically.   I am not aware of any town not a big city they are different that doesnt have an economic driver that keeps people who arent the elites of that driver out of the best places bubble maker.  My hometown had a big caterpillar plant most people who didnt work there couldnt live in the nicer parts of town...  The only exception I can think of is towns where everyone is poor and there are no good schools.Just remember why the grass is greener or the other side of the fence.  They fertilize with bullshit.,ithaca,ch14elz,12,t5_2rp73

924798,0,t3_24p28n,Unfortunately Time Warner was the only option I could find with better than Mbps. While I despise the company and their customer service is terrible the speeds have been consistently as advertised. Also the BampM TWC storefront on State St has competent people working.

2660840,0,t1_cn5uoap,Interesting. If I may offer my perspective  Thompson Countys very conservative but the city itself is still very liberal socially anyway. Theres always gonna be the assholes for whom being Arab is a bad thing but Id say its not something you have to hide in Ithaca not that its something you should have to hide anywhere.Also not sure whether youre Muslim or Christian but the Al Huda Islamic Center is fairly close to town EDIT words,ithaca,cn5we98,1,t5_2rp73

Much of what my child experiences on a weekly basis are things that my wife or I never had an opportunity to do growing up.  This is a unique place.,ithaca,cs4n0y6,5,t5_2rp73
4343054,0,t1_csf57cq,Here you goIn New York state there were  murders in .  were committed with rifles  with shotguns.  with knives  with other weapons mostly clubs and  with fists and feet.Fists and feet slightly outnumber rifles and shotguns combined. Youre literally more likely to be beaten to death by an unarmed man than shot dead with a long gun.Heres the numbers for aggravated assault meaning assault with a weapon that does not include murderIn New York knives fists and feet and other weapons each outnumber firearms by a factor of two. Not just rifles and shotguns all firearms. The rifles and shotguns portion of that is probably down near roundingerror levels.Incredible isnt it? All these rifles around and nothing happens.

5570568,0,t3_3rf8af,There are a lot of free spots around with caveats but those spaces are in high demand because as youve noticed it is stupid expensive to pay for parking all day.  Some people might not even want to tell you about them...but get comfortable with Farm St Linn St Titus Seneca free but have to move it halfway through the day and GenevaAlbany Streets. Youll have to walk a few blocks but thats good for the body AND the brain and not that far at all.You could also ask your employer to compensate you fully or partially. ,ithaca,cwnkwbk,3,t5_2rp73

6353684,0,t3_411ldk,Ithaca is really really difficult to leave geographically speaking.  Its  hours driving distance from any sizable cities.  The airport is tiny and has a pretty high cancellation rate for a perfect storm of reasons.  The taxi service is abysmal probably due to its monopoly so even getting to the airport from  minutes away can be pretty difficult at times.,ithaca,czbudmo,1,t5_2rp73

Its a good lunch spot before walking around the Commons.OP the Finger Lakes is a great region with plenty of nature stuff to do wineries to visit they could go to the Cornell Plantation that is pretty cool.

9674455,0,t3_5dm4fe,You might consider moving somewhere that feeds into ICSD but feels more rural. West Hill comes to mind or Ellis hollow road or out on . Alternative Community School which is in ICSD might be a supportive setting for your teenager. FWIW I also like trumansburg but I cant comment on how the trumansburg schools would feel for a gay teen. My gut says ICSD would probably be a more supportive setting. ,ithaca,da5kvhc,6,t5_2rp73
9675269,0,t1_da5m98w,Just to clarify West Hill amp Ellis Hollow rd are both still Ithaca city of. There are probably less than  lots withanacre between the two though. And if youre looking to rent that would be even more tight. You should really consider a broker and consider Trumansburg.Slightly more rural than Ithaca good liberal schools a downtown amp a bus into town so your daughter isnt recklessly spending half her free time desperately bored amp finding rides to the Ithaca Commons. Growing up you met a lot of kids from Enfield or Groton or Lansing without a lot of direction or reason for being in Ithaca just kind of avoiding their small town afterschool routine. ,ithaca,da5ohhh,2,t5_2rp73
