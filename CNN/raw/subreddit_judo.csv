87611,0,t1_ceoc67m,gt I think that if competing at an Olympic level is going to naturally cause showboating and suchlike then it proves an important point Judo should not be an Olympic sport. Or if you prefer sport Judo as prescribed by the IJF is not Kodokan Judo as created by Shihan Kanoah but Kano pushed the sporting aspect of Judo and very much wanted it to be an Olympic sport he was instrumental in getting it to be a demonstration sport at the  games. He sat on the IOC helped set up the Japan Amateur Athletic Association. And before he was creating Judo Kano was an educator who was a big proponent of bringing competitive sports into Japanese schools. And I will say that getting that focused and intense in a match is fun. The is showboating as you incorrectly identify it does not preclude sportsmanship in fact my point was that shouldnt factor in. At a US Nationals a in the mids I had a battle with another guy. We went back and forth going crazy after each point making adjustments on top of adjustments. I lost  and when it came time to shake hands we embraced instead because the match had been such a backandforth battle. No ill will over the celebrations just a love of good hard competition and an appreciation for the others efforts. Of course there are dicks in any sport but you seem to be holding to an unrealistic ideal of sportsmanship from a time that never really existed. There was never a time when every high level competitor showed no emotion and just coolly shook hands after some form of championship. ,judo,ceoeja6,2,t5_2qkzy
95106,0,t3_1v5som,gt .So I figured I should get a tokuiwaza and drill it many times with all sorts of setups and grips that would have good synergy with this tokuiwaza.Like someone else said in here and I say it all the time as well you dont find a tokuiwaza your tokuiwaza finds you.  What that means is through continual practice a throw will develop for you that works with how you like to move how you like to grip how you defend ect.I know youre not a beginner but what I would tell a beginner is work on tai sabaki shintai tsugi ashi and then use these basics to develop your ability to throw.  Im  and most people would think ippon seoi nage would be my tokui waza.  Mine is good but osoto gari is by far my tokui waza.  Heres the other thing once that tokui waza develops you wont even really have to drill it with all sorts of setups and grips because it will be second nature.  Thats what makes a tokui waza special.  I can throw with osoto gari with just about any grip but the grip I only practice with is standard sleevelapel.  ,judo,cep9amh,2,t5_2qkzy
102187,0,t1_cepug5j,Not at all  See the do at the end of Kendo? Like the one in Judo that means way and it refers to the fact that its a way of life not just a fighting style  its about everything. Your attitudes your beahviour and so on. On that point I imagine not all organisations do so but JFAUK bases gradings in part on behaviour outside of the dojo. That sort of behaviour gets you penalised in Kendo not because thats traditional but because doing that shows that your attitude is not within the spirit fostered by the tradition and as such your kendo is bad.

2125495,0,t3_2ja4ic,The first tournaments I competed in I had similar feelings but I channeled towards a desire to win as uMrStretchnuts put it. This proved more successful. Whenever I am nervous before a fight I replace the thoughts of the possibility of defeat into I will go in there and do what I am trained to do and fight. I will impose my kumikata on the opponent. All long as there is effort there will always be accomplishment.Once you progress you will learn how to set yourself technical goals and strategy for the match and tournament besides just the urge to win like I will dominate the powerhand of this opponent forcing him to adjust his kumikata opening up for my favorite technique. Or I will force kenkayotsu in this match nullifying his uchimata for example. This might keep you focused and even if you loose you can always evaluate what went wrong and learn from it. If you are defeated and cannot reflect upon what went wrong then you are denying yourself the satisfaction of actually knowing what mistakes you did.

Being stocky starting young working tirelessly and being Japanese used to work pretty well but that may not work for you anyway.If you want to play judo seriously give it a whirl. If you start winning in a local level try the regional level and then the national level.

A bye is when you have no fight or a walkover in a round of bracket.  shidos add up to hansokumake. This is not a direct hansokumake you will be allowed to compete more.. Leg touching is sadly hansokumake so that is what got the guy you were talking about. Submission failures are mostly due to people not training enough Newaza. This year half almost half of my fights were won by armbar. My coach went a season where over  were submission. It all comes down to skill and style.I personally dont understand the gripping. People get nervous and then go grip crazy and it annoys me to watch. There can be TOO MUCH GRIPPING.  of clubs have coaches that teach seoinage wrong. As a results  of athletes do it wrong. So then they just fail at it over and over again. Please understand the exaggeration. People dont attack at the right time. Some people throw up before they fight from just being nervous. Some people are also just genuinely ill before. Never a fun time at national ranking tournaments...SHOES ON MATS  RINGWORM AND OTHER NASTY THINGS...I yell at people who do this.

3503520,0,t1_cprgr34,Glad its getting better. Thats usually a good sign. I probably would not have gone to the doctor either but I wouldnt take medical advice or a diagnosis from a Chinese acupressure massage therapist. I tweaked my upper back recently while drilling sasae tsurikomi ashi. I felt a knot slowly form between my spine and shoulder blade of my hikite side while I was just standing and listening to instruction. It got progressively worse but I kept working out. My randori was completely shot to hell that night. It would hurt when I breathed deeply turned my head or leaned over to pick something off the floor. It was really depressing for a couple days. I took  mg of ibuprofen and messaged the heck out of it with a tennis ball. Its finally  after a good night sleep.

3646374,0,t1_cq7ni0u,gt I hope I dont violate any rules by posting in Wednesday thread on Friday.No dont worry you can post questions actually any time in this subreddit. This thread is just there to encourage those who are too shy to ask otherwise and also to bundle up such topics.Stiff arming is a very common problem. There are various ways to address this. Here are some options Explain to your partner that he wont make any progress if he keeps this up. Push against the stiff arms from below against the elbows. This often makes the opponent bend itthem or taking off his grip. You can follow up with O Soto Gari if be suddenly bents his elbow as a response to the pressure immediatly pull it down to your own hips and turn about  for the attack or Sodetsurikomigoshi if he lets go of his grip push his harm diagnoally across and enter with your hips. Try to attack from different angles. Stiff arms are the strongest against a frontal attack. Try to attack diagonally or from  or even  angles. You can pull yourself into a back grip for tsuri goshi for example step by step by moving your grip further and further around their back which increases the pressure on their stiff arm on the same side until it folds. just walk backwards. He has to bent his arm to pull you back or step forward follow you. Either way you may be able to exploit this via Ko Uchi Gari Sasae Tsuri Komi Ashi or Hiza Guruma perhaps maybe even Uki Otoshi. There are some armlocks that can be applied in such a situation but unless you really know what you do Id advise against them because there is a certain risk of injury. For a right sided ipponseoinage grip theres this grab the sleeve of ukes right arm at the elbow but not at the outer side. Instead put your hand further under it until you can grab the cloth at the inside. Then pull it tightly outwards. This may bend his elbow. At the same time move your right hand over his left arm and then dive with your entire right arm and shoulder under his right arm. This has to be done with your entire body of course. It is helpful to initiate it with pushes into the opposite directions first like pushing his elbow down and inside first. Some throws may even work at stiff arm distance depending on the length of your and his limbs. Hiza guruma for example.,judo,cq7www1,1,t5_2qkzy
3721104,0,t3_32vvo8, Fix your posture both standing and on the ground.  Think about keeping your hips under you and your knees bent while standing and on the ground use pressure on your opponants hips to posture up when in guard again hips under you plus theyll be less mobile. Your stance is more stable and more mobile when your hips are right. Dont patty cake or slap fight when going for grips like your coaches tell you grip and throw. Grip fighting is complex and important so work on it with your instructors. Id call the first throw wazari since you clearly landed on your side then rolled through. But thats me being a stickler and I admit Im not sure of the current rules on rolling through. Your opponant looked like a BJJ guy but even so work your escapes from pins. I know its hard to get your wits about you once you land from a throw like that but the earlier you work your escape the better.  Dont give your opponant time to settle into his osaikomi.

4105629,0,t1_crntqbn,One of the things that makes judo so effective is how it is trained. Randori allows for live training and any training not supplemented by live training is much less effective than otherwise. Atemiwaza is not trained in judo with liveness and you can only really get a cursory knowledge. If you interested in strikes learn a striking art.

Theres usually one or more examiners present all judoka who will be tested that day and sometimes even an audience family and friends.The exam may include a technical part where you have to show basic techniques like breakfalls simple throws and pins. Sometimes randori or even a tournament like fight is required. If a victory is necessary depends on the federation.If it helps you try to assume a different mindset than Oh no I am being tested try okay Ill show you how its done. Dont say it out alound though.

That being said a great pearl of wisdom from my sensei is worth thinking about The first step of a throw should always be the last step of walking. Meaning that you should always set up a throw as though youre simply changing directions or taking another step.

But you cant have technique alone.  To bolster your technique you need speed and timing.  You achieve these by uchikomis  hundreds and thousands of them.  It takes a lot of effort and most dont put the time into developing the nessessary speed and instead fall back on strength.  Ive fought masters that when you fight them you dont even feel their grip on your lapel.  Not until your laying at their feet.  So my opinion as a shodan with  years experience is that fine tuned  will win against strength everytime. ,judo,cuez1hw,1,t5_2qkzy

When I attack with say de ashi harai its to get them to move to a position where I can attack with a big throw. Ill take the foot sweep if I can get it but I rarely expect an ippon from that attack.

5420894,0,t1_cw3qiai,Think a different game. Light mma sparring with a twist put a marker in one guys hand and stipulate whoever gets marked first loses. Im confident youd see a lot more attempts to impose a strong wrist control game.    Edit or replace a marker with a wiffle bat and make it bludgeon vs unarmed sparring and youll probably see a lot of the deflection side and circle stepping and wrist interception that aikido uses. Its most likely not going to be so pretty and neat like aikido demonstrations but its not like judo randori and shiai doesnt get ugly on a regular basis.,judo,cw4krg0,1,t5_2qkzy

5776851,0,t3_3u902b,Ura Nage is my absolute favourite!Some think that Ura Nage is just a brutal throw with a lot of force. In fact Ura Nage is not a counter but a sen sen no sen technique where you anticipate a movethrow by your opponent and attack in his initiative and use his first movement and vulnerabilty in openingturning his positionposture for your own throw.  If you try it as a pure counter gaeshi you are too late if Uke knows how to defend. You have to feel the start of the  attack by Uke and lower your hips tension your core and start closing your arms and hands simultaneously when Uke turns in for his throw. Its even not much lifting involved. Next important point is to control Ura Nage to the very end in turning yourself from a reversed bow with Uke loaded on your hips to your side and front to smash him with both shoulders on the tatami and have immediately control in Newaza with a pin if you only get Yuko or wazaari for your throw.  ,judo,cxd68d3,4,t5_2qkzy

6078699,0,t1_cygbs6z,Okay lets see... tori has assumed turtle position and uke ...A ... kneels in front of tori Tori can grab the legs or trousers of uke left and right outside the knees with his hands. On one side lets say the left for example he just blocks ukes right knees movement towards ukes right. With is right hand he lifts up ukes left leg and pushes with the left side of his head against the left side of ukes torso. He takes him down similar to a wrestling double leg takedown. Alternately if uke extends his arm into toris turtle from the front that his between head and arm tori can attempt to execute Laats Dive in an Uki Waza variant from the ground. Think Kata Guruma while sitting on your butt with one extended leg. Yet another option in the same situation is holding onto ukes arm and turning out to the side. For this plant your foot far to the side you got the arm plant your empty hand on the ground and shove out your other leg to the same side. After this you will sit with your back leaning against uke who is now in a turtle postion himself. Immediatly let go of his arm and  turn into the opposite direction to take his back. Ukes arm enters from the side under one of toris arms. Clamp down and catch it. Turn out similar to version  but now you have a hold on ukes arm that allows you to attack with Waki Gatame or some other arm lock.B ... sits or kneels to the side of tori. Uke tries to reach across the back of uke and under his armpit. Clam down and catch his arm preferably above the elbow plant the foot closer to him down rise your hips and roll over with him on your back. Think Soto Maki Komi from the ground. Finish with a tight cradle hold that is catching his legs with your free arm folding him up and putting your weight onto his stomach. You need control or he will attain a backmout position. If he seems clueless what to do turn towards him head first and try the options listed under A EDIT Remembered another option. Tori can try to roll over his shoulder closer to uke. If done right tori can pull uke into his guard after that or try Sankaku Jime if uke is completely dumbfounded by that moveC ... he is behind tori.This is difficult to deal with for tori. He can try to catch ukes trousers inside the knees rise his hips and do a forward roll while draggin uke with him. The outcome is rather unpredictablehard to control. In the best case tori assumes a backmount position at worst uke gets it. Its a scramble move.D ... on tori.Uke might step over tori or hang over his back and reach for the collar. Tori should hinder uke to plant his hooks that is placing his heels left and right inside toris legs. If uke cannot plant his hooks or forgets to do so as beginners often do but still reaches forward for toris throat tori can pull him down over his shoulder while rising his hips off the mats.,judo,cygeg2h,3,t5_2qkzy

6516034,0,t3_44iqvq,I have to contradict what some others are writing here.Judo was not founded as a sport. It can be a sport but its purpose is far wider and some Judoka still live and practice it that way. Very shortly spoken Kano described the purpose of Judo with three dimensons of purpose in mind FightingSelfDefense ability physical education and fitness mental and moral improvement.The sportification on the one hand has helped Judo spreading widely but the must win attitude that often comes along with it is not what Kano had in mind. He wasnt enthusiastic about the idea of Judo being part of the Olympic games. Nor did he remove dangerous techniques from Judo he merely provided ways to practice them safely.The IJF as an international body is not democratically elected and its true intentions have little to nothing to do with what the founder wanted. No Judoka is bound to abide to their rules outside competitions held by their rules but since national federations adapt to the IJF rules instructors and competitors world wide focus only on what helps them win comeptitions and neglect or omit other techniques.Also competitors often focus on a selective set of preferred techniques and see no reason to pursue the full canon of Judo techniques which renders them often unable to teach these negelected techniques properly once they reached such a position.In short being a sport has to some extend helped Judo gain popularity but along with it came a ton of problems.,judo,cztb4ft,2,t5_2qkzy

7370536,0,t3_4g9yu7,Thats interestingthe part about the presence or absence of kamiza. I hadnt thought about it but thats one other major change in judo as opposed to earlier arts. Im sure Kito Ryu had its own ryuhaspecific religiousmetaphysical beliefs its my understanding that they pretty much all did. Im pretty sure Kano gave a blood oath keppan to at least one ryu but I dont believe he required the same from even the earliest Kodokan students. Thatd be an interesting research topic.What really struck me was that quote about religion and education. It seems that Kano had some rather aggressively for the time secular attitudes in this regard.The part about bows not meaning respect in older jujutsu because you were going to kill the person you bowed to did get a bit of an eyeroll from me. For one thing theres a ceci nest pas une pipe component in the majority of contexts in which jujutsuka would bow to each other they were going to train or perhaps compete but were not trying to kill each other. There is a world of difference between a contest or training session which abstractly depicts lethal violence and the real thing. For another learning strict etiquette was basic selfdefense so to speak in that earlier time period a huge number of vendettas and feuds often disastrous for all involved regardless of who won were started by poor etiquette or bruised egos. To say that rei was not a key component of traditional bugei seems like an absurd claim to me.As for the larger topic of what a bow means one quote about bowing that I rather liked came from an aikido instructor of mine. Admonishing people for bowing while smiling or chatting he said something like No thats not what a bow means. You bow to get past the personality. Were all friends here but you need to approach practice seriously. You have to at least briefly forget that this person is your friend and instead respect them as a partner and in a sense an opponent or attacker. I like this practice using the bow to mark a clear break between everyday life and technique.A related point someone observed that more dangerous training e.g. with live blades is also often associated with much stricter etiquette. For example much of a given iaido kata is actually etiquette of a sort which serves more a social or safety than combative purpose. One can imagine that it was important to ingrain certain patterns of safe swordhandling and deescalating posturing so that if and when you had to draw your sword and use it the adrenaline wouldnt make you do something stupid. So you have for instance a drawing sequence that methodically takes you right to the brink of the draw everything ready but still without having clearly committed to violence until you actually draw and cut in an instant. And then theres the slow methodical way of resheathing the sword probably a lot of people lost fingers or gashed their hands hastening in their efforts to resheathe a sword with postfight jitters.,judo,d2fz97z,3,t5_2qkzy

They are likely familiar with what techniques you can do how you move to setup these techniques etc so can shut you down instinctively after time.This is one of the many reasons I think its really important to travel to other dojo occasionally to see how you fare in randori against some people who dont know your judo intimately it can sometimes be a better way of gauging progress than facing the same people repeatedly.,judo,d3ivs98,4,t5_2qkzy

7857945,0,t3_4msz6x,I absolutely agree with you that the Kyu and Dan grading system in Germany needs some serious reforms.However there are a few more points about the pros and cons of your listgtblack is black is a problem. Too many are stopping at shodan.I agree but I think that is just the natural way of things. Imho that is about the time when Daddy time happens and university family business etc. gets in the way of training. Therefore I doubt that this can significantly solved with a different grading system. Further down in this thread you saidgt I see it the other way there are too many instructorsteachers who are having little clue of randori and competition. They like to to teach Judo in a static way where they can explain their principles and details because its easy on a puppet.I absolutely agree. But in the same post you went on gt Therefore there has to be a technical and teaching exam for th DanImho that is a bit of a contradiction. Technical exams have a high risk to deteriorate to static dance choreographies where students can show the techniques with a cooperative partner but have no clue how they actually work in randori.I myself stopped taking the DJB Kyu tests at green for this very reason. I got my blue belt awarded by my teacher when he thought my skill was overall sufficient. Much like they do it in BJJ. We handle all the belts up to st Dan that way.While both systems have their pros and cons I much prefer this method to technical exams for the reasons mentioned above. I think making the grading and test system in Germany simpler and more modern is a great idea. Especially for adults. Everything is very clearly tailored for small children in Germany. But I would not stop there. I think we should seriously consider trying the BJJ system and leaving it to the teachers if and how they want a formalized test.,judo,d3zay5e,2,t5_2qkzy

Use the leg that is on the same side as the arm grabbing  it and put it on the lapel above your grip and stretch out. This creates a very powerful pull on the lapel.

8193450,0,t1_d51nfsk,. Its ukes responsibility to give you the right amount resistance and posture required. Being a good uke is hard for a lot of people.. Depends on the throw. But generally speaking you want to pull from a distance in an upward angle so as to bring them onto their tip toes.This will create a space to allow you to fit in your throw. . Generally speaking you should be just stand upright feet about shoulder length apart. Be relaxed in your upper body so they can work the hikite and tsurite yet be rooted below the hips. If they want to lift you in their uchi komi relax in the lower body so as to let them. Some throws require a slight bending of the leg on entry then an extension so as to lift your partner off the ground etc. If you dont allow Tori that lift theyll never preform the throw properly.,judo,d51qe9e,5,t5_2qkzy

I guess what I am asking is why arent there other organizations putting on judo tournaments that allow other rules because it seems unanimous that people dont like the ban?As uAliabitter pointed out maybe not enough prestige in nonIJF tournaments for the competitors.

9543448,0,t3_5bky8p,Judo takes a long time to master. As a beginner it is helpful to learn one throw in each direction and to cover the different throwing principles of Judo. This could look like this Ko soto gake direction backleft O uchi gari direction backright Tai otoshi direction frontleft Left side Tsuri komi goshi direction front right Tomoe nage direction to the frontNotice how all these throws have a different throwing direction as well as a different throwing principle e.g. gake gari goshi. The throws of this list are just examples. As a beginner you usually learn O soto gari O goshi De ashi harai and Seoi nage first. As you can see they all have different throwing principles as well as throwing directions. So you can build up from these too. It is important to be flexible instead of focusing on only one specific technique for beginners. Later on after you mastered the basics you can start specializing in your favorite techniques. It is very helpful to learn the throws with a traditional sleeve and lapel grip first before studying competition related kumi kata. Learning to throw from the sleeve and lapel grip properly is essential for the development of good kuzushi breaking of balance. Throws like the traditional tsuri komi goshi are ideal for developing good kuzushi and arm movement. You can later on easily work your way up to more difficult throws like Uchi mata or Tai otoshi if you mastered the traditional not sode Tsuri komi goshi.On the ground you should focus on learning a turnover or armbar or choke for every attacking position e.g. attack the turtle from front side back  attack from the guard position. As for the throws Learn the basics and underlying principles first instead of studying  different competition variations of techniques. It doesnt help you if you can turn someone with a world class turnover but are unable to hold him because you never learned how to hold someone properly. Practising escapes from pins and general defence on the ground is also of great importance. As for youtube videos Be careful and aware about the quality of them. Some are very good others very bad. Ask yourself the question Is the instructor a professional famous Judoka or someone unknown? This can help beginners to watch quality videos instead of poorly executed techniques. Of course there are high quality videos of unknownhobby Judokas but as a beginner it might be hard to seperate between the good and bad videos. I hope this helped you a bit. Remember Be flexible and aim for perfection of the basics instead of rushing from one competition technique to the next without having mastered the standard version of the throw.,judo,d9pfen2,3,t5_2qkzy

If you do Randori with a green belt in Judo you know they will at least have a good break fall and probably know a fair amount of techniques even if their implementation is lacking.I like the idea that if I roll with a Zero Stripe BJJ White Belt I know they will likely lack technique that I should approach submissions with caution since they probably arent familiar with proper defense and could injure themselves.Physical cues like the belt are important for training with longevity while still getting the out of each session.I also like that we are offered a tangible goal as beginners but after a couple years you shouldnt need the tangible goal anymore.,judo,dd45jjx,1,t5_2qkzy

As kryptonite...well...see comment above and added to this very few judoka compete and even fewer compete outside of IJF rules.If you can already do judo then leg grabs are icing on the cake. If you cant then theyre no more than a crutch and you need to improve your other judo.FWIW I teach leg grabs to all the BJJ guys because they are expedient cross over well between ginogi and usually bring the fight to the ground one way or the other.

11187854,0,t1_df0043z,gt Ive always pretty much swung my foot up towards the arm instead of resting it on the hip...is this why I never properly get the tap?Sorry I was talking about the initial set up rather than the finish. Ill be more detailed if that will help describe what Im suggesting Uke is stiff arming with standard grips ai yotsu and assuming both players are right handed for the purpose of this explanation obviously lefthander vs lefthander works in exactly the same way. Tori takes a small sidestep to the left to make space with that space created tori puts his right foot on the left hip of uke. Tori straightens his leg on the hip and pulls ukes arm straight with the hikite grip. At the same time tori uses the foot on the hip as an anchor point and pivots as he falls onto his back at this point tori should be horizontal to uke. This looks a lot like an attempt at Yoko Tomoe Nage which will also stop you from being shidod by an overzealous referee and the Juji Gatame tends to come from uke recognizing this and dropping his base to jigotai which is perfect if uke doesnt react in that way then you can throw with Yoko Tomoe nage. Uke should have his balanceposture broken and be either falling onto his knees or in a very awkward bentover position on his feet. Tori now shoots his hips up and throws his legs over the backshoulder of uke into a typical Juji Gatame position. This should be an explosive movement often powerful enough to roll uke onto his back. Finish the Juji Gatame either from the typical Juji Gatame position or from guard. If uke is savvy and defends the armlock then a if uke was rolled over use the momentum of the roll to take Tate Shiho Gatame and pin b sweep uke into Tate Shiho Gatame with a kick over action PendulumFlower Sweep in BJJ terminology and pin c switch directly from Juji Gatame to Sangaku Jime or Ashi Sangaku Garami depending on which presents itself and personal preference.I hope that helps! ,judo,df04oya,6,t5_2qkzy

11776200,0,t3_680mxq,It really depends on your club. There are two main aspects  breadth and depth.You may be at a club that only has a few moves on the ground but they are drilled countless times and really sharpened up in newaza randori. If you go into a BJJ match or roll then if you find the match steered into these areas then you will likely dominate. But if the match goes any other way then you will feel lost.You may be at a club that is very liberal with the number of techniques taught. Then if you go into a BJJ match you will likely be prepared for more not all outcomes but you will obviously have spent less time focusing on each than someone from the other club. But again the outcome of the match will be determined by where the techniques are steered.No matter how much newaza you do in the club it will still be different from a BJJ club. Very few Judo clubs acknowledge leg locks let alone train them with any regularity. Most clubs will not work very much on standing guard passes beyond extreme basics. And very few clubs will work much on back attacksdefences beyond a very small subset of what is possible.So a good Judoka can have a good chance of beating BJJ guys on the mat at the lower levels but once you go higher up then specialisation becomes much more important. Likewise a good allround BJJ fighter that trains decent standup will fair okay at lower level Judo matches but be lost at the high levels due to their opponents specialising in the ruleset.Hope this helps.,judo,dguva9l,10,t5_2qkzy
