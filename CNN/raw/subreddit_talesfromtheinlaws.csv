551011,0,t3_20dier,Im a little lost here. Why on earth is she your friend on FB? She appears to be completely and utterly toxic and Im not sure why either of you would friend her on FB. I love my mom to pieces but if she pulled that shit Id unfriend her in a hot second. It doesnt seem like your husband wants anything to do with her. Since thats the case I dont get why youre choosing to put up with her shit.,talesfromtheinlaws,cg2wmxu,1,t5_2yemt
