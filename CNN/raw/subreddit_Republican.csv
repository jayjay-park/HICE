17596,0,t1_cegf3nr,I can get behind most of those proposals.  Im not sure about lowering the minimum wage though.  We already have protests complaining that wages are too low.  People seek to work so that they can provide for their families.  Lowering the minimum wage further may allow them to work but they still will have problems providing for their families.  The root of the problem will still be there.  While I agree we need more jobs I think its vitally important that we create jobs that provide workers with the ability to support themselves and achieve a reasonable standard of living.  Minimum wage jobs dont do that.  Less than minimum wage jobs would do that even less so.  I dont think that wage policy in either raising or lowering the minimum wage will have too much of an effect unless its a drastic amount.  Instead we should find ways to encourage investment and innovation.  One Idea I have is to make capital gains taxes and corporate tax rates progressive.  Im not talking about raising the upper end just lowering the low end.  Perhaps we could lower capital gains for the first k to encourage the average guy to start and grow his own LLC and lower corporate tax rates for companies with revenues under  million.  Id much rather see actual small businesses and innovations pop up than a new walmart or another hedge fund.  ,Republican,cegfqd6,5,t5_2qndt

423740,0,t1_cfomez7,gtNo it is not. However it is your perception of it as such that results in the commonly held belief among leftists that no ill effects will result from cutting military spending and putting it into social programs instead.I dont see how you would get that from what I wrote. It employs millions of people and it has an incredible impact on the economy and the rest of the government. Entire towns exist solely because of military bases.The military provides enlisted members with both book and on the job training in a way that the private sector abandoned long ago. Its a nationalized healthcare microcosm for its members and their families. The military provides housing and food allowances for its members in addition to their normal salaries. The military provides a major education assistance to current and former members.Nothing I said was inaccurate. Like most of my fellow service members or at least the ones I met I joined because I didnt know what to do with my life. I have a good job now because of my military experience.I was simply saying that if youre going to bash welfare defending the military is not a great place to start.

533222,0,t3_2071ce,Ready for a long post?  Here it goes...First off by last  years what you really mean is the first  years of Bushs presidency since thats the only time in the last  years republicans have been able to pass laws unopposed.So what happened during that time?Well Bush inherited an economic downturn as the dotcom bubble burst right before he took office which only got worse after  because you had lowered demand from the dotcom burst lowered demand from people scared after  and higher gas prices which hurt supply and demand as it increased costs for businesses and left consumers with less money in their pockets the cost is also recessive the CEO of my company might make x as much as I do but he doesnt spend x as much on gas.Now for even more added fun the industry hit most from people scared after  was the airplane industry one of the few things generally manufactured in the US instead of in China or somewhere else.And yet economically the downturn wasnt all that bad and didnt last all that long.Now its hard to compare recessions in general but by itself Bushs handling of the economy he inherited was pretty good for Americans in general.Another unfortunately unsuccessful example deals with GOP opposition to Fannie and Freddy governmentfunded organizations that probably played a roll in the recent housing collapse.  While democrats like to say the trouble came from there not being rules to prevent the issuing and sale of bad mortgages the fact remains there also needed to be someone to buy these mortgages for the system to work and Fannie and Freddy were largely responsible and still are buying mortgages and losing money.In any case it doesnt take a genius to connect an organization whose goal is to increase mortgages regardless of cost and a recession that stemmed from the existence of mortgages that should not have been made.You could also look at the current battle over schooling and whether poor kids should be able to choose to go to private school.The system can only benefit the poor since it doesnt force them to do anything and the history of many white immigrant groups who rose to middle class status often includes parents cutting corners to afford private school for their kids.  It could be argued this divide in private education is a major factor in the racial income divide that exists today.Yet democrats oppose it because it would weaken teachers unions their major donors.,Republican,cg0vu9b,1,t5_2qndt

It makes sense though because Frank probably gets hired as a consultant and is paid to attack specific wording problems rather than going at the conversation from a broad theoretical conversational standpoint.  While I in no way want the political discourse in our country to go more down the dude  or hellifIknow route its on now the GOP has got to stay more current with using vocabulary that is relatable and current when talking about their points in order for the general public and those people who are open to listening to the GOP.,Republican,chjq415,2,t5_2qndt

Because at some level there are people up high who are okay that were seen as white and racist. Fuck if I know why.I dont mind social conservatism. But when thats what the closet racists in the party want to hide behind then Ill go after that too.You can be a social conservative and listen to WuTang or NWA or Eminem. But basically saying you dont like black culture because of your social conservatism is a fucking copout. If we need to have broader conversations within the party about what is and isnt racism then we need to have those conversations but the fact is that that sort of shit isnt happening. If its because its an uncomfortable conversation then we we need to have them more because while were all having silent internal meditations on the issue those paternalistically racist fucks on the Dem side are beating our asses like a goddamn drum on the race issue and were not even showing up at half those fights. Edit Incidentally can you imagine the shit Colin Powell and Condi Rice have seen within their own party? For the younger crews its different but we do apparently have some legacy racism to deal with.

There was no reason for him to get out of his car.  And in my experience people who carry around town are usually scared of confronting anyone without their gun.  The people who can handle themselves leave the guns at home unless they are hunting.There were  seconds between the time that Trayvon ran away from Zimmerman and the dispatcher asking him to stop following.  How much chasing is Zimmerman doing in  seconds.  Based on the  call he never stopped trying to find Trayvon in direct opposition to what the dispatcher was telling him.  The police never never asked Zimmerman to follow Trayvon.  In fact in my entire life I have never heard of the police asking untrained civilian to try to track a criminal.  There was just no reason for Zimmerman to case Trayvon unless he was trying to be a cop which requires a gun.gtBecause no one but Zimmerman saw the entire sequence of events.Well at least one other person saw the whole sequence but Zimmerman killed him.  It is interesting that everything that Zimmerman said is taken as fact even when there is no evidence to support his claims.  For instance you keep stating that Martin was casing houses but there is no evidence for that claim other than Zimmermans statement.  In fact there is evidence to contradict that claim.  Martin was talking to a girl on the phone while walking down the street.  I dont know about you but I rarely talk on my cell phone when I am trying to stealthy or inconspicuous.gt...except he wasnt on the street  he was in peoples yards in the rain at night looking into their windows  which is why Zimmerman thought he might be suspicious.Again based on what evidence other than Zimmermans account.  Zimmerman had every self interest in making Martin look as bad as possible to save himself from jail or prosecution.

1179922,0,t1_ci2bduu,No you dont. You can buy a car right now without a license or drivers ed. You can only drive it on your property but my point is you can still operate a motor vehicle without a license. I would also like to point out that if you buy a car and dont register it dont have a license dont insure it even if you get stopped you will likely only get slapped with a fine and your car towed. And statistically cars are more dangerous than guns.I think Congress should make the NICS system available to everyone. You would still have to get the permission and information of the person you do the check on but it allows people to make sure that the people theyre selling guns to are legally allowed to own them. I also support adding mental health evals to the NICS system if the NIMH was able to identify and define the types of mental illness that might cause a person to engage in irrationally violent behavior. This would streamline the system as gun shops are swamped with requirements to perform NICS checks for guns theyre not even technically selling because the buyer needs somewhere to ship it. That is an unnecessary restriction.As far as licensing I would support a Federal concealed carry license or National reciprocity bill that allows a person with a concealed carry license to carry in other states. The fact is there are places in the country with de facto handgun bans chicago DC NYC LA that only enable the black market in those cities to thrive because they force citizens looking to protect their families to engage in illegal activity to do so. If preemption was set on a federal basis so that those cities and states had to allow responsible lawabiding citizens to keep and bear arms the black market for arms would drop considerably. If you have ever had to go through the process to buy a handgun in for example the state of NY you would understand why many gunowners are wary of more gun control restrictions.,Republican,ci2d0h8,9,t5_2qndt

3254109,0,t1_coz2r4l,If you like how the internet worked up until the last ish years then you should like net neutrality. Up until recently the major ISPs not really including mobile carriers have done a good job of selfregulating to adhere to the principles of net neutrality.Thats been changing though. Without net neutrality then ISPs can and have charge websites if they dont want their speed throttled to that ISPs customers or even if they want to reach them whatsoever. Or they can start charging their customers if they want full speed access or any access to certain websites. Or both. They can also start instituting caps or selling data by the GB except if you use their videomusic streaming services those wont count against your data quota Comcast already does this with On Demand. Or hell maybe they decide that traffic criticizing Comcast costs extra or that you simply arent allowed to use a Comcast connection to make pronet neutrality statements. We havent seen precisely what was actually passed yet but the idea of net neutrality is that ISPs cant discriminate against any traffic based on what it contains they must treat all data equally. ISPs at one point were in favor of this paradigm because it meant you couldnt sue Comcast if a Comcast customer starts uploading movies illegally on their service but as time has been passing its become clear that even absent net neutrality they arent at risk of this. Net neutrality coming into effect should prevent more change than it causes.,Republican,cozarkt,3,t5_2qndt
3260063,0,t1_cozr9ux,gt Given Mark Cubans technical background Im sure he understands.I just read Mark Cubans Wikipedia Page and there is nothing in there to suggest the man has any technical background.  Working as an owner or salesperson at a technology company does not make you a technologist.  Ive worked with sales guys and owners of technology companies and they tend to be very knowledgeable about the what they are selling but hire the guys with the technical degrees to figure out the how.Guys in his position hear lots of technical terms but they generally dont have a formal understanding of what they mean and often get confused by them.  There is a lot of jargon in technology and Mark clearly doesnt have a grasp on it.The very first thing he says You get   megabit channels thats  gigabytes. is wrong for  reasons.The first is terminology.  The word he was looking for is  gigaBIT not gigaBYTE.  A gigabit is  the size of a gigabyte.  Any technologist will tell you this as this is one of the first things anybody learning network technologies is taught the basic terminology and mathematical units of bandwidth.The second factual error in this statement is that  megabits is a gigabit not  as he statedIve worked with guys like this before.  The guy that ran our systems integration company only know how to use a Blackberry and didnt own a television.  His eyes would glaze over when people started talking tech on him but he knew how to sell it and he knew how to ask the tech guys if they could build it before he sold it.  Mark Cuban is a salesman and entrepreneur and many other things however he is not a technologist.The rest of his rant goes downhill from there finally making threats that the government will make you buy more equipment.  Your existing subscriber equipment is capable of managing the network any way your ISP or government regulator sees fit.gt But really what was wrong with the internet before all of this?Until quite recently not much.  Net Neutrality principles have been the standard operating procedure since the inception of the Internet through gentlemans agreement.  The idea is you take care of data originating on your network you pay your network provider for all of the traffic you generate and consumers of Internet pay for how much they can download at one time.Recently Comcast has made efforts to change this model.  Not only does Comcast want to charge their subscribers for network service Comcast is also approaching content publishers like Netflix to start paying Comcast directly on top of the network fees publishers pay their own network companies.This is an unprecedented action.  Comcast systematically degraded their subscribers ability to get quality service through Netflix in order to create a scenario to attempt to sell Netflix special access to Comcasts subscribers.  Eventually Netflix capitulated and started paying Comcast for a fast lane as they were losing subscribers due to Comcasts actions.  For months Netflix subscribers using Comcast networks were subject to slow streams buffering and connection errors that would make the videos stop playing.In this way Comcast held their subscribers as ransom to Netflix in order to get Netflix to pay.  If Comcast has their way they will go to every major content producer and extort money from them in a similar fashion.  This is the concept known as paid prioritization and it is the major victory for the Internet thats included in the Net Neutrality FCC rules.If paid prioritization were to become the rule instead of the newfound exception that Comcast has created every major ISP would attempt to open negotiations with content producers and each content producer would have to pay off the ISPs in order to access Internet consumers that are those ISPs subscribers.Objections to this include the time and cost associated for each content producer to enter these agreements is significantly prohibitive.  Innovation on the Internet would decrease as there would be a significant increase in the cost structure of innovation on the Internet.Another objection is that many ISPs also offer their own video Cable Television and voice services VOIP  telephone that compete with other services on the Internet that would be subject to ISPs paid prioritization.  These paid prioritization schemes raise the cost of competing services to the benefit of ISPs own video and voice services.  The establishment of paid prioritization creates an anticompetitive situation.However the most common sense object to this is that ISPs are simply looking to get two entities to pay for the same service.  Consumers pay ISPs to bring all of the content of the Internet to them with a guaranteed speed  megabit  megabit etc..  Now ISPs want to approach content producers for payment in order to make good on their promise to consumers.  It is a fundamental change in the relationship between consumers content producers and ISPs.  The only merit in all of this is that it gives ISPs who are swimming in profits more revenue.  It doesnt give consumers anything they dont already have and it doesnt give content producers anything they dont either.,Republican,cozx0j6,3,t5_2qndt

It seems based on his comments that he is unaware of the large discrepancy between mental health and mental illness. This country has a mental health problem not necessarily a mental illness problem. We do a terrible job educating people about how to navigate their thoughts and emotions and operate under the assumption that everyone will figure it out. Even the people who have it figured out still could do it better. Instead we live under the assumption that everyone else has it figured out so we need to pretend to. With this being the case its no wonder people shoot places up. So much pressure no release and no way of handling it productively. Thats a mental health problem.

Why do you think this number should EVER increase. Do you want them giving up  of their income? ?! ?! Why do you want to cut military spending?! You were born into a world where you feel safe because this WAS the greatest geopolitical super power nation in the world. That does not mean if we are to strip our military power that you will continue to be safe. Do you not see the Chinese warships posturing off the coast of Alaska lately?

5918390,0,t3_3wdhkk,I find myself very torn on this. On the one hand Im wary of waging substantive fights through procedural proxies I disapprove of using ballot access against candidates all nonfrivolous candidates in the race ought to be on the ballot that just seems obvious to me. Ordinarily then all the nonfrivolous candidates in the race ought to be in the debate.On the other hand a debate cant function with more than about six or seven people on stage. By analogy those who fault Justice Thomas for listening rather than speaking at oral argument should consider what it would look like for all nine justices to be participating in the current hot bench. And the number of nonfrivolous candidates in the race exceeds the number of people that an effective debate format is able to contain.So what do you do? The optimal solution is for Paul among others to recognize that he is at this point a vanity candidate that regardless of whatever merits he brings to the race he isnt a serious contender for the nomination this year. Candidates using the nomination process as a platform to elevate their ideas or profile is an abuse of process and if you dont have a plausible shot at the nomination your campaign has to end. But if he wont do that then whether or not I would prefer to see him pushed off the stage I find myself hardpushed to get upset that someone else has pushed him off the stage.

5971197,0,t1_cy2adoy,Wow youre a trip.gt No lets not. The law that authorizes it has been on the books for  years  U.S. Code  When I say something is unAmerican I mean that persecuting a particular religion is antithetical to our origin as a country and the philosophic ideals that our country is based upon. Of course we as a  country can choose legally to do whatever we wish that doesnt make those laws consistent with the philosophy of our origin.I would also love it if you could find a judge who believes that being a Muslim constitutes reasonable grounds to believe that the person is going to overthrow the US government. Just because you can ascribe a particular intent to a reading of the USC does not actually make that the law.gt Islam is a political movement that requires the overthrow of the US government and the death enslavement or subjugation of everyone who does not subscribe to it.Yeah citation needed for this. Ive met plenty of American Muslims and they dont seem any more or less American than any other American that Ive met. You also havent answered the question about how you tell if someone is Muslim. Even if the law said what you think it does which I disagree with to enforce it one would have to know that someone is Muslim. How do you determine that?gt That Islam also happens to be a religion doesnt change that.The Church of Scientology has in the past broken into government offices to steal documents and spied on government officers Which I would argue is a fairly large extralegal intrusion into our government. Would you also support excluding them?gt The same way we used to deny entry to communists who would lie about their beliefs.And that method is?gt We can of course start with a denyall policy for immigration from Muslimmajority countries and then look at exceptions to that for specific individuals if they can be vetted. What is left of the Christian Jewish and Hindu communities in those countries all know each other within a community so vetting shouldnt be too difficult.Here is my issue with your proposed policy. Terrorists have the resources to fake the vetting process they also definitely have the resources to move their agents to other countries that arent majorityMuslim. All your policy would do is exclude honest Muslims without impacting the ability for terrorists to get in at all.The reason why Im pushing this point about determining if someone is a Muslim is that you cant. ISIS has been recruiting from the UK for example. So a white man in his early twenties from London who has never been to a Mosque in his life and has an anglicized name could just as easily be an ISIS extremist as a brown Muslim from a Muslim country.gt Second by closing every mosque in the US in the same way we closed the embassies of the Axis powers during WWII.Have you ever met a Muslim in your life? Youre entirely off base here.gt Third by interning such Muslims as are US citizens for the duration of the war unless another country is willing to take them  as we did with Axis diplomatic personnel during WWII and with such US citizens who were also citizens of the Axis powers under Executive Order .Again how do you tell who is a Muslim? You want to make a registry of who is of what religion in the land of the free? One thing that alarms me through your remarks is the way you cite law as if something having been legal makes it moral. Slavery was legal. Legality ! Morality.At this point Im honestly praying that youre trolling me.,Republican,cy2cscq,1,t5_2qndt

I dont believe so because the republican presidential field is full of candidates itching for a chance to dismantle Isis through military power..  Is it low information minimally educated voters getting their info from Facebook memes?  I dont think excessive Facebook users are listed amongst likely voters... I could be wrong...Nothing really makes sense to me except  thing.  Trumps entire supporting base might be a phenomena similar to the silly occupy Wall Street fiasco.  Yall may recall there was substantial participation and support for OWS.  Yet As OWS gained momentum any actual demand or purpose became nonexistent.  It rapidly progressed into a mob of people pissed off at multiple things but no real leadership direction or agenda.I think trump is the same as OWS.  I dont think many folks have any reason to back trump other than being pissed off about a single issue or two and a lot of folks all pissed off at different things.

If a company is selling products in the US wont that be taxable US income regardless of where they are doing their manufacturing?

Thats because the US taxes US companies on earnings regardless of where earned and so if their domicile is in the US they pay US taxes on both their US earnings and their foreign earnings.

7401298,1,t1_d2ja6xg,Why would Hispanics want to support the GOP anyway? Even before trump the GOP has elevated itself on an undercurrent of racism for the past  years that wasnt explicit for the sake of political correctness but Hispanics arent stupid. The only thing trump did was expose this racism in plain view for all to see. The GOP has never really represented their interests so Hispanics have not and will not elect them. Not now and frankly not in the future. Unless the GOP really cuts out racist rhetoric from their ranks Hispanics will not support the GOP. Now with Trump the GOP is inevitably headed for a fracture but I think this is a great opportunity to cut off the racist wing of the party. Trump has done a fantastic job gathering up the most radical elements of the party into one discernable group. The GOP will most likely lose this election but they should not lose this opportunity to cut this cancer of xenophobicracistultranationalist rhetoric off swiftly and throw it to the wind. The GOP might not recover for years or possibly decades if this were to happen but at the very least it would once again provide a platform for reasonable conservatives to have a say. As it stands the once honorable Republican party is becoming too extreme and does not represent the politics of actual conservatives. To continue on this road is guaranteed suicide. And on the topic of young people there are several ways in which to reach them. . Support their chance for decent wages so they can experience their own American dream. The reason most millennials are anticonservative is because time and time again GOP politicians have explicitly fought against their chances for decent paying jobs either through rhetoric or policy. . Give millennials options for affordable higher education. The GOP has not helped itself by continually cutting off funding for education and just as an example the student loan rate hike a few years back was seen as direct inaction by the GOP to do anything about it.. Focus on real issues that affect them. Millennials dont care about gay marriage abortion and immigration as much as infrastructure student debt education healthcare etc. They see this attention on wedge issues as pandering to the GOP base and that is a turn off. I could go on but the GOP will have to work much much harder if they ever want to get the young votes.,Republican,d2jh8sc,4,t5_2qndt

10117281,0,t1_dbq7fyt,I agree in terms of accuracy of analogy.The reason though that I bring up the holocaust is that the actions of Israel surprise me in terms of causeandeffect.  Like I am part Jewish on my dads side so Im not actually Jewish and was raised in a community with a lot of awareness of the holocaust.  I read the Maus comics and discussed them we discussed a lot of issues pertaining to the holocaust in school and I saw great awareness of the holocaust in the Jewish community the sense that we needed to be aware of what happened and tell stories about it and make sure to embrace values that would prevent those sorts of things from happening.  And those values that I saw included a sense of solidarity with anyall oppressed people...and Ive heard this time and time again from within the Jewish community things like solidarity with African Americans who are subjected to racism Asian Americans who dont fit into the whole mainstream Christian culture and many other groups.  And people generally expressed awareness of and concern with small encroachments in peoples rights as well as changes in political rhetoric that people saw as moving in the direction of extremism that might culminate in genocide.This is why when I learned about the actions of Israel later in life it was not taught to me in school I think I only began to become aware of it during college but even then most stuff I learned much later it really puzzled me.  It seemed completely at odds with my picture of Jewish values that I had grown up with values that seemed shaped by the holocaust in really deep ways.  And not just by the holocaust but by other forms of oppression.  Like my Jewish side of the family came over originally from Lithuania in response to a sort of encroachment by the Russian establishment that in many ways paralleled what was going on in Nazi Germany....a little restriction added here and there...finally culminating in one of my relatives having a boat of his seized at which point people in the community started to leave.  And people tell stories about these things happening with the idea that its important to support values and a government that would prevent it from happeningnot just to Jews but to anyone.This is why I bring up the holocaust.  It seems really bizarre to me that the same culture who seems to not only be aware of but speak out against the sort of gradual encroachment on rights and properties based on an ethnicreligious identity or divide would carry out this sort of thing themselves.,Republican,dbqaflr,3,t5_2qndt

However Trump could promote someone directly to a three or four star general position. So if Trump wants to replace all of the Never Trump four and three star generals he could. He cant outright fire them but he can order them to step aside from their position. It is scary to think that Trump is actually trying to staff the general positions with people who supported. Is there any precedence for this?

We have a ridiculously bad budget problem and the Democrats are all either ignoring it till it goes away or convinced we can pass massive enough tax increases to cover it all without destroying the states competitiveness. Half the Republicans think we can fix the budget solely through spending cuts but Im a part of the half that realizes we need both spending cuts and tax increases at least temporarily if we are going to fix it. Accusations of entrenched political machines overzealous public employee unions and out of control spending may be overblown by Republicans in some parts of the country but in Illinois they are real problems. In general Republicans here are more reasonable than the Democrats with a good record of putting the public over the party. Our Senator Mark Kirk replaced by a Democrat this November was maybe the strongest neverTrump Republican voice in on the hill leading up to the election. Thats the kind of Republican I am.You are correct in your guess that when I say something is societys responsibility I dont always mean the governments responsibility. Republicans are generally better about making that distinction. But in this case yes additional government spending may be needed if we are going to limit bodily integrity in that way. I cant pretend there arent serious constitutional questions but I also cant ignore that we are talking about ending human lives. Thanks for answering about the video. Yea  weeks is pretty early. A layperson probably couldnt tell the difference between a human and a dolphin embryo at that point but for me its firmly past the point where its life worthy of protection. The fetus of course wouldnt have consciousness as we know it yet but there are brain waves and reflexive movements. It amazing to think that  years after St. Jerome wrote The seed gradually takes shape in the uterus and it abortion does not count as killing until the individual elements have acquired their external appearance and their limbs we are still considering how human a fetus looks to decide if its a person yet. Our technology has given us some incite but its all still so subjective. It begs the question though where is your line? Viability? Later? Again no judgement just wondering.

Is it worse than the wish that some people on the right will be raped by a rhinoceros? On my Facebook feed after the election so many leftists categorized me as a racist homophobic woman hater. I voted for Trump because he was the lesser of two evils in my view not because I agreed with everything he proposed not because I condone some of his behavior. And yet in light of some objectively bad choices for president I apparently hate women hate minorities and hate gays. Also a bunch of Trump voting women hate woman. Also a bunch of Trump voting minority voters apparently hate minorities. Also a bunch of gay voters hate gays.This was all over my Facebook and all those stories of whitesupremacist graffiti was actually done by Hillary supporters who were angry. There was a homosexual who ordered a cake at a place like Walmart it wasnt walmart but I forget the name of the store he added the word fag himself after taking the cake out of the store and brought it back to complain trying to get a poor cake baker in that department to get fired and also to get money out of the company and get a lot of publicity to garner support for gay rights. What he did was disgusting absolutely disgusting.Remember when leftists trashed that Republican headquarters? Im not even going to mention the protests themselves because protests have a lot of emotion that gets the better of people. But look at the comparisons of the leftists who are protesting versus any right wing protests you have seen. The leftists are blocking traffic including ambulances BLM got in trouble for that. The Trump protests erupted in burning cars and the police categorized many of them as riots. Not all of them were peaceful protestors.People are incredibly turned off by this behavior. Its part of why Trump and Republicans all over the board won their elections. And while there are a few who are waking up to how despicable the behavior is there are more who are digging in their heels and doubling down on the vitriol focusing on superficial things rather than important things. And they do it on every level they use the same language about policy.Like the wall Im not thrilled about the wall but there is certainly some validity to the idea. We need better border security a wall will help and depending on how that wall is constructed and how much of that wall is technological i.e. sensors in the ground to detect tunneling cameras etc versus just a physical wall it could help a lot. We dont know what the plans are yet. But despite that people are claiming the wall is racist and its despicable. Only after they say its racist will they mention the cost. There is nothing inherently racist about a wall we have Mexican Americans here who are just that Americans. They are hard workers and contribute a lot to society. But they are Americans those Mexicans trying to get over are not Americans. We should be able to have control over who enters our country. It has nothing to do with race. When leftists call it racists it makes a lot of people on the right want the wall all that much more.They arent getting into reasoned discourse they are jumping to racism. Or they jump to us hating women when we want to stop funding abortions in other countries. Why is that an indication that we hate women? We just dont want to use our taxes to pay for abortions overseas. But the claim and the insinuation is that this policy is misogynist.The GOP may buck Trump but right now about  of what hes doing not saying but doing is making us very happy. Only about  of what hes saying is making us happy the rest is incredibly frustrating. I think it is far more likely the left not liberals per se I specifically mean the left will make some really bad moves this is about as close to war to them as you can get without grabbing your guns.

Theres actually an effect named after CNN called the CNN effect CNN started in  Fox News didnt start until  at the height of the Clinton presidency. And the ratings for Fox didnt really do much until about  after the attacks. And the slide of television news into entertainment really started in the s. And theres evidence that Politicians abandoned what they used to do which was in part explaining to their constituents what the best move was. Sometimes they would come to their constituents and tell them Hey I know we wanted X but it turns out the cost of X is far to high to be effective so what we did was Y which is a compromise that will be good for everyone. Now they say You want X?!?! Ill get you X! And screw everyone who stands in our way.Anyway I still dont see why you seem to set Fox as the ultimate blame for all this let alone the GOP. I mean I see you acknowledge numerous other factors and even ones that predate Fox by decades if not centuries. I appreciate your masters degree and your thesis writing on this topic but not having read your thesis nor scene what you have studied I dont know that your information is any better than mine.

10756341,0,t1_ddp05lp,I feel that people can agree that the government of the US can decide what they want to consider to be marriage.  As a legal construct anyway.  I do think that they need to respect actual votes instead of using court cases to get gay marriage in place.  If we had all voted as a majority to allow that then I feel like it doesnt really affect us as individuals.Abortion on the other hand is the one item you will have extreme difficulty in making a middle ground on.  No one is getting killed in gay marriage situations.  However I do think there can be moderate answers even to abortion as long as the prochoice side can accept the fact that people dont want to pay for abortions and that we should be working to reduce them to the absolute minimum.And for our part recognizing that they have a point about helping out with women who do decide to go through with pregnancy.

10780356,0,t1_ddrwtws,it certainly does merit a look but we shouldnt be turning this into a witch hunt either.update since there are people in the comments arguing about the definition of witch hunt let me clarifythis does seem to be a little hyperbolic. I feel like people have been looking for a reason any reason to impeach President Trump. And if this leads to that then antitump people are going to do everything in their power to bring that about. This is unfortunate because they really arent giving him a chance. His cabinet isnt even fully appointed yet.And I realize that this may disappoint people that I am not saying down with trump and this administration but the reason for that is there has been a lot of mud slinging lately and I want to urge caution that we fully see what is going on and not burn any bridges until necessary.  Witchhunts were known to basically be guilty until proven innocent.   We wouldnt want someone to assume our guilt before having all the facts weighed nor should we do this to any other US citizen regardless of the position they hold.

10796104,0,t1_ddsrucd,I agree with your comment about corporate subsidy or corporate welfare.But I dislike the minimum wage and I dont think it is the best way to solve this problem.  I see it as a market intervention and I think it has some problems It doesnt adjust for cost of living and is thus hard on businesses operating in regions and subcultures that have a lower cost of living. i.e. the employmentreducing effects hit hardest in these areas  I dont think its a coincidence that rural areas especially in places like the upper midwest and south where there is a very low cost of living tend to have strong sentiments against minimum wage and tend to be allied with the Republican  party more than the cities which benefit more and are hurt less by minimum wage. It creates an incentive for underthetable work which can include both tax evasion and employment of illegal immigrants. In many cases paying your employees a higher wage is a good idea and I dont like the idea of forcing people to do things just because its good for society as a whole Id rather the government create incentives and create space for people to make good decisions.  As I will explain below in my proposed solution I think the current tax scheme has the opposite effect.How would I propose to solve this instead?I much more strongly prefer progressive taxation a shift of the tax burden away from lowincome working peoples wage income and towards higherincome peoples income especially passive income.  I think it is especially important to ensure that people who are living below the poverty level pay little or no tax and to raise taxes on very high incomes.  This includes the payroll tax.  Currently verylow income people pay little or no income tax but they are still paying the payroll tax in full.  This is a hugely regressive tax.  Okay so why do I think this would help? Lowering tax on lowincome working people would immediately place more money in their pockets so people would provide an immediate boost in spending power even without their employers having to spend any more. By lowering the portion taken out by the government its effectively lowering the cost of employment so employers would be able to give their employees a moderate raise without any changes whatsoever.  I think this lowering of the cost of employment would lead to both higher wages and higher employment a winwin contrast with the minimum wage which at least in the shortterm and in some circumstances could lead to job loss The raising of tax rates on high income earners especially passive income would reduce the incentive for squeezing more profit out of a business in the form of dividends or paying the people at the top usually the owners in a small business a very high salary.  It would become a better financial decision to reinvest longterm in the company such as by investing in employees hiring them or giving them raises thus growing the longterm value of the company which would not be taxed until it was realized as capital gains.Does this sound plausible?  I really want to see the Republican party seriously discussing this moving back towards a more progressive tax scheme and abandoning market interventions like minimum wage.,Republican,ddtjhqw,2,t5_2qndt

On the other I know those are not really what the movement is about just like the all lives matter campaign was originally supposed to be something that included everyone and sought true equality among everyone.  Its unfortunate that that movement was coopted by the white supremacists movement.  Because I think including everyone in the debate is what is really called for if racism is ever truly going to be delt with.

The analysis of the CBO and multiple independent policy institutes directly state that the AHCA will result in  million more Americans without insurance by .  Further the people most hurt by the bill are older Americans who are middle class or lower  they will see astronomically higher premiums under the AHCA.

Forcing these people to pay into a health savings account which they may never use until its passed on to someone else at retirement seems a very bad outcome...and it also could encourage superfluous spending under the logic of well I cant use this for anything else so I might as well use it on these medical things that might not be necessary...exactly the opposite of what Id want to encourage.,Republican,dfh3l33,1,t5_2qndt

11344231,0,t1_dfgyp5g,Hmm...How about an end to right to work laws? We could do it in the state constitutions to avoid expanding federal power. My thinking here is that if we could resuscitate unions in this country we could do something about income inequality.After that probably some kind of aggressive action on climate change. Other things Id like would be an end to laws that criminalize homelessness and criminal justice reform.Postal banking would be nice to have too I guess. Would be a revenue source and would really help poor communities where getting a bank accountcard is difficult.What Id give up...universal concealed carry as mentioned. Make it easier to fire federal workers who arent doing their jobs...cut subsidies to industries that dont need itthats a thing you guys want right? I mean honestly Im having a hard time of thinking of stuff you guys want that isnt just...spiteful I guess.

11371764,0,t1_dfkxjgk,Yes but you CHOOSE to go there.  Google does it too.  So does pretty much every retailer anywhere.  The issue is that the amount of data collection you could get from the ISP would be obscene and most people dont have a choice in their ISP.  Further with the right tools it would be very easy to analyze a months worth of bulk data from one region and isolate it down to an individual.  For example you have a job at chase.  I could look at all people in your area who go to payroll.chase.com or chase.comemployeevpn or some such and quickly isolate it down to your household.  Then I can see whatever you do online.  Now the ISPs have some internal privacy policies.  Right now your ISP has a good privacy policy because they couldnt see that information for money.  They also have the option to change it at their discretion.  Amazon has good reason to keep your information internal as do most retailers because they want to use that information to improve their business.  Your ISP collects far more data and has nothing to do with that data other than sell it.  Further the information they collect would be potentially more valuable to Amazon than their internal information because they could track where else you went and I mean you because they could match records against the ISPs and use data mining to maximize their business.  ,Republican,dfkyv9i,10,t5_2qndt
