9957335,0,t1_db5f55h,Hey Josh! Well done in the recent show DArts isnt necessarily the way to go it depends what is right for you. I went in as a dancer trying to improve my all round skill set and then found I had a knack for acting and was then lucky enough to get a TV role. A lot of people never go to college and gain an agent through short films and National Youth Theatre. Speak to as many people as you can work hard and dont beat yourself up. Thats the best advice I can give!,ClassTV,db5gsgs,8,t5_3a5v4

9957763,0,t1_db5gyo5,Totally! Firstly Ram needs at least  more blooddrenchings that goes without saying.Secondly Id love to see some more impact on the Who universe as a whole whether that is through monsters or through something that will affect the Doctor directly. Id love to see more of Charlie and Quills backstory. ,ClassTV,db5isuk,20,t5_3a5v4
