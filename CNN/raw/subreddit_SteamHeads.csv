37532,0,t3_1uhrgk,I had the same issue. Someone here recommended Loctite copper based antiseize and a good cleaning. Seems to help a lot. ,SteamHeads,ceipd5q,2,t5_2vudb
473930,0,t1_cft1y9w,Ive yet to see any of the  watt controlled devices from china but then again Im pretty happy with my current setup and havent done the frantic searching like I did while still engaged with and eGoclearo setup either. ,SteamHeads,cfu4zs6,1,t5_2vudb
1295546,0,t1_cifcs71,Yeah there is that. Id love to try one of the big Msize batteries too but figuring out an effective recharging system is a hurdle. Even a  amp enabled micro USB would take a while.,SteamHeads,cifd6dp,1,t5_2vudb

10037616,0,t1_dbfwes6,LiPo packs dont look like  batteries theyre square and require different connections and chargers than normal batteries. That being said they can fit in the same box sizes that s can but just require different wiring. Youd need a mod specifically built for a LiPo pack but the mod size would be close to the same size as a dual  mod and wouldnt be nearly as heavy or large as a dual  mod.,SteamHeads,dbfxepa,1,t5_2vudb
