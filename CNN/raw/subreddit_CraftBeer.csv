It functions well its fast and it serves its purpose I assume.You dont have a favicon on your site.  You might want to add one .From a webdesign stand point it looks like the site works without a hitch so thats good .  It loads well on mobile too.  Is this a custom WordPress theme or did you customize an existing one?  The only thing I noticed about the theme that I didnt like is that the photos of the beers are so small!  I love a beautiful beer and think you would do well to display how beautiful the beer is loud and proud.I was going to suggest some plugins like Yoast but it looks like you already have a few of those installed.  Google Analytics appears to be set up too.If you arent using Ninja Forms for your contact form page consider doing so.  Its a very handy plugin that not only makes forms easy to manage but it also keeps track of them in the CMS as well as email.  That makes it a little easier to manage the messages that come in.Consider a custom  page  I like to create a custom feedback form on this page to give people an opportunity to let me know how they got to that page and instead of just a search box I also put most recent and most popular posts on the page.  This helps with bounce rate a little.,CraftBeer,cznf752,1,t5_2rmyr

10461896,0,t3_5psk2m,Ive drain poured both Heady Topper and Pliny before because after  or  months I find them to be undrinkable. But to each their own. Our brewery makes a fresh hopped IPA and one of my coworkers prefers it aged a year rather than fresh which I honestly thought was so disgusting. He also hates Zombie Dust. Its just a preference thing and you cant fault someone for liking something different from you.,CraftBeer,dctynnk,3,t5_2rmyr

They are usually just tiny spots right outside the casinos but check in CVS or Walgreens.  I saw some good stuff in those for cheap when I was there in February. Im talking like  stove pipe cans.Im gonna throw this one in there and maybe regret it but theres a rooftop bar called Beer Park at Paris.
