The irony is totally lost on them because theyve been drinking the koolaide for so long. Theyve gone so far to the radical left that theyve circled around to the other side and are just as intolerant and close minded to alternate opinions as the far right. I find it extremely depressing. Same reason why I cant stand Safe Places. Differing opinions  hate speech? White males arent allowed to have an opinion? Way to go youve alienated people and damned your cause.

People were never going to vote for a candidate that they didnt like or trust and Hillary lost because she is demonstrably corrupt not because of Republican tricks and definitely not because Trump was a strong candidate.  If your looking for someone to blame for this blame folks who voted for Hillary in the primary I do.  If your looking for someone to blame for this blame the DNC establishment who cheated in the primary and then in the general shouted down every dissenting voice who tried to warn them this would happen. If your looking for someone to blame for this blame Hillary herself whose narcissism corruption and incompetence handed the country over to Trump. Your grasping at straws to blame everyone except for whos actually responsible.  Grow up,Reform_The_DNC,d9xxmc9,2,t5_3hgki

9645369,0,t1_da1zgx2,I assumed wrongly it turns out that Sanders voters had the sense god gave a mule and would do what it took to not let Trump win. My faith such as it was in their strategic intelligence was grossly mistaken. Apparently the Supreme Court means nothing to them.  What baffles me is that they so blithely assume Clinton voters would have swarmed to him thus giving him the victory in the face of a Trump candidacy when so many of them so callously refused to do likewise. ,Reform_The_DNC,da1zowf,1,t5_3hgki
