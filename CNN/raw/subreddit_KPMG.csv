Having said that like the earlier comments expect to work long hours but since you are looking to live in NYC I assume you have that mind set already.  When it comes to picking up the right place it really depends on how well you work with your colleague its a very team oriented job  especially youll be working long hours with your team members so enjoying their company will make your work more enjoyable.  I would not use  as a determining factor but how you mesh with the people you met and if there is certain tax sector that you are interested that one of the employers might be stronger at at the moment  keep in mind that clients do tend to switch around.Hours in big  in general are cyclical you will have period requiring overtime and you will have period that are less busy  but the flexibility is there and is one of the best option to start off your career.,KPMG,cx175qa,1,t5_2sjf7
