2205650,0,t1_cleiggh,I tried it with Access in the first place but struggled with the output to search terms. DIn the meantime I did a custom field layout in my copy of comic collector but it looks ugly and is clustering my actual comic collection. So I might stick to excel.,tcgcollecting,clk6x05,1,t5_2urxr

4074840,0,t3_37987n,Adventure Times Card Wars is basically a single player game since the main mechanic for getting cards is playing pve. Games sucks though just my opinion you might like it and is mobile only. Its the only one I know of though that meets your criteria.,tcgcollecting,crkrazr,2,t5_2urxr

7394233,0,t3_4glu3m,Its been far too long since weve talked AeroGirls but we have good news here at GringoGaijin we have now officially launched out Kickstarter campaign!For those who are wondering or need a refresher AeroGirls is a WWI style trading card game played with  players with the main objective being to destroy all opposing bunkers. The main catch is that in this game theres not really a whole lot of men  for the most part men were tragically lost in the previous war. As such women have stepped up to take the reins of the different warring nations and at the front of the battlefields are the eponymous AeroGirls  women who have somehow been injected with nanites and can absorb different pieces of technology into themselves. While our game might sound awesome in concept it doesnt mean anything if we dont succeed in funding our Kickstarter  thats where you come in! If youre interested in learning more about the game or wish to contribute to the cause feel free to click here to go to our page on Kickstarter. We have a slew of different rewards for all those who contribute and we are looking forward to not only meeting our minimum requirements but our stretch goals as well.,tcgcollecting,d2iobpd,1,t5_2urxr
