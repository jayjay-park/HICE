266715,0,t3_1x49lh,Yeah this is kind of why I was reluctant to go tomwar with Xenon. Ben can be extremely irrational and hotheaded. I witnessed it first hand in a brief flirt with Reddit Rho.,redditvortex,cf8el0q,2,t5_2zluk
936585,0,t3_24sija,i like the Thursday schedule it means Sundays are totally free for me and it works well.As for Tuesday war we can probably have it alternate week. I agree it can be E consuming and for someone who is new at a TH like Phazon or when I will go to TH we would need a bit more time to farm whats lost.,redditvortex,chaqtse,1,t5_2zluk
975395,0,t3_259mqn,Looks nice just I would change the date to either international format DDMMYY or the American standard MMDDYY. Having it be YYDDMM is very confusing.,redditvortex,chf5tnh,2,t5_2zluk

1980321,0,t3_2he36j,Personally and idk if its correlated but I dont  like the dibs system. I feel like we dont do as well when we use dibs. Could just be a huge coincidence but it seems related to me somehow.EDIT second thought are we doing too many wars? When was the last time we checked in to see what the people want as far as frequency of wars? I know it is a bit much for me. I get the whole teambuilding and pride thing but its tough to farm while spending around two million elixir a week for wars. Im not really sure how much longer I can keep that up for.,redditvortex,ckrtvks,1,t5_2zluk

2716867,0,t1_cnck6ec,TH gowipe is such a waste because you dont have a Queen a Fourth spell or the extra  troop spaces.  The difference with a queen and  extra wizards is over dps!So you will have more luck as a TH.,redditvortex,cncwamr,2,t5_2zluk
