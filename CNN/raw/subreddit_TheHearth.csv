5858301,0,t3_3vh8mg,I love aggro freeze! The only fullaggro deck Ive really enjoyed. I wish it was a little bit stronger though. It just seems to be missing some pieces.I dont run any charge minions. I dont want to play a golem on curve and Im find a lot of mid game defenders right now. Ive been playing with owl and sorcerers apprentice with a lot of success.

5979355,0,t3_3xcbi5,My initial thoughts are this...My guess would be that agro and strong curve mid ranged decks would be the most difficult for this deck. What hero power do you search for with Finley?Spell slinger seems like a gamble card  perhaps farseer would be another option.Warlocks IMO are the only class that can use reno well. Maybe with Finley getting you tap it is possible to cycle enough but that is inconsistent.What rank are you? I would love updated reports and possible refinements,TheHearth,cy3fafy,2,t5_3ac51

6120136,0,t3_3zd5us,My pieinthesky dream is to get a full collection then eventually transition to full gold and then back fill to a full collection of standard and gold cards.. Get two of every card golden or not.. If you have two standard cards dust any golden copies in order to craft more standard cards priority is completing the collection. Dont needlessly dust golden cards keep them if you dont have standard copies.. After getting a full standard collection start collectingcrafting golden cards.. If you have almost enough dust for a golden then dust the standard card to craft the golden version.. Eventually turn entire collection golden..

6184816,0,t3_407a9r,Been playing a basic fatigue defense warrior with a Reno. It still works against the right matchups. I like the deck a lot but some of the wins are strenuous and some of the losses are outright.,TheHearth,cysne0s,1,t5_3ac51
6254390,0,t1_cz0iq9d,Im thinking Deathwing could be an interesting card for your deck. It may be pretty common to be losing the board by turn  and if your opponent doesnt have an answer its basically game over. Onyxias effect could be really useful as well if you really want the dragon synergy.Maybe you could run the Blingtron and Harrison combo as well but I dont think youd get enough value out of it.Justicar is also a good option if you get Armor Up or Lesser Heal from Sir Finley.Baron Geddon can be a good way to stop people from flooding the board.Alexstraza can heal you and thats big in this deck.If I were you Id replace Noz and possibly KT with two of these depending on your needs and what you think suits your playstyle better.,TheHearth,cz0k16m,3,t5_3ac51

6452803,0,t1_czmove3,Well this topic is a just for fun discussion. I love hearing people getting excited about some of the old classics seeing play again. Just last week I read an article where Brode was saying that he loved that it was so hard to earn golden Senjin because he was so popular and people seem really excited about this stuff. In terms of whether or not they are going away people tend to look to Magic as guidance. It seems to me that it is likely that after a time Wild will be truly Wild with bizarre decks that are not balanced and it might not be well suited for regular play. Thus I do think that the retired cards will fall heavily out of favor for most players especially if Arena updates as well.Additionally players joining for the first time after this update which is what it is supposed to do! will have almost no reason to really go back and collect a lot of retired cards especially since they will be pretty expensive. As someone above smartly pointed out though it will likely be some time before Wild gets really out of hand or unbalanced and it will take time for long established players to retire and lose the reverence for some of the older cards.,TheHearth,czmrfd8,1,t5_3ac51

6506314,0,t3_44r4z6,I want divine favor nerfed so bad its not even right it ruins hearthstone for me more than any other card. Dont get me wrong Knife juggler and FoNSR is annoying but if i have card advantage on you and i had to take  damage to get to that point theres no reason i should be punished for it. ,TheHearth,czsavnk,14,t5_3ac51
6507440,0,t1_czsavnk,As someone who experiments a lot with Paladin I can say that Divine Favor is not that great of a card. Most of the times its dead weight. It draws you  or  cards at best against most decks and a lot of times it wont be able to draw anything or itll just mill itself. It only does well against RenolockHandlock Warrior Miracle Rogue and Freeze Mage. Sometimes against Anyfin Paladin and Priest. Consider that Paladin doesnt really have any other great and cheap way to draw cards. Hammer of Wrath is  mana too expensive for  damage  draw a card. Lay on Hands is too slow. Blessing of Wisdom is the only other good way for Paladin to draw cards and its likely that itll draw one card before it gets silenced or killed.Id agree it probably needs some sort of mana increase something greater than  mana so it doesnt combine with equality  concentrate maybe make it cost  mana   mana for each card it draws you.,TheHearth,czsf2xm,8,t5_3ac51
6519208,0,t1_czth6ko,Also I like a worgen and jungle Panther is good cos its basically a delayed arcane. Flame juggler isnt bad either since it can hit face or smack a token often good card if you run into a lot of Paladins since it can usually hit  face damage ,TheHearth,cztmy2p,1,t5_3ac51
6543699,0,t3_446tbp,Short answer yes hes too slow for midrange.  Long answer the only decent deck that can justifiably run cenarius is ramp Druid which just ramps into dropping fatties and at most runs  set of the combo. Its  because cenarius just isnt much of a tempo play so midrange Druid cant justify a card with his cost and effect. Side note theres a reason why you dont see much or any ramp Druid on ladder and thats because it is far too slow. Maybe the new set and standard will revive it.,TheHearth,czw66ug,1,t5_3ac51

7386674,0,t1_d2hspz2,Well we need  Desciple triggers to get to  attack on CThun thats really not a lot. If we can draw into  desciple we should be able to consistently have either a shadowstep or a bran or a shadowcaster or even a vanish. If we play no card draw we will have the tools to trigger a twin emp before turn  roughly  of the time. Adding another earlygame CThun minion ups that chance to  which is not too shabby.The prepsprint combo might be a really good idea actually. We have the potential for a lot of carddraw in FoK azure drake and bloodmage but sprintprep lets us make the deck with a lot more cheap minions for consistency vs agro and more situational cards when we need then. I will  playtest this maybe even with  copies of both prep and sprint.Edit thanks for the feedback thats why i posted it here,TheHearth,d2htbi4,2,t5_3ac51

Aggressive weapon warriors that close out the game within a few turns more midrangeey patron warrior style decks and full control warrior. Blood hoof Brave has definitely been an exceptionally powerful addition. Paired with Blood to Ichor you get  stats for  mana which is insane. Ravaging ghoul is also seeing a lot of play. The miniAoE has a lot of different used. Nzohs first mate and Bloodsail cultist really are staples in the weapon warrior deck. Ancient Shieldbearer is also seeing play in every Cthun Warrior deck which is not insignificant amount.  Even Malkorok is seeing play in the weapon based warrior decks.

I have tried quite a few proactive decks including but not limited to dragon decks. It is really hard to gain the board early game. Seeing even hunters have better tools for that is infuriating.Until they get some card to help in the early game priests best strategy will remain grinding the opponent until he gets out of resources.This is sad for priest players and apparently pisses quite a few people off.,TheHearth,d57po63,2,t5_3ac51

9172661,0,t1_d8dbaex,The important thing to remember is that one selectively remembers all the games won by bloodlust but rarely the games where it was a dead card. I have a very hard time imagining that bloodlust boosts the shaman mirror matchup because if you already have a full board that the opponent didnt clear with maelstrom  storm you had already won the game and bloodlust only sped things up. In the shaman mirror I think cards like harrison barnes or the nd storm would improve the matchup much more than bloodlust does. Not saying bloodlust is bad but it is very often a winmore card and I think its mainly in control matchups where the card pulls wins that otherwise were losses.,TheHearth,d8epb2p,1,t5_3ac51

Or conversely is there something that Im missing about these decks that are called token druid?Honestly the rise of midrange shaman with its x portal and x lightning storm has made pretty much killed all token decks.  It even kept zoo down for a while and thats saying something.  Since you cant reliably build a board anymore spell druid with its multiple large threats became better in the meta than token druid.  Token still works great if you can somehow dodge the shamans.,TheHearth,dam4ypq,7,t5_3ac51

10094233,0,t3_5kbgxb,Kazakus made its autowin matchups harder. The fast decks tend to be a bit too fast. You can get a doomsayer off on curve and still very realistically die on turn . For these and other reasons its not considered good at the pro player top level. Still its a challenging and rewarding deck to play and you can spend a LOT of time mastering it. The skill ceiling for FM is incredibly high so you can always feel like youre learning and improving. Personally its still the deck I play most and if youre not concerned about blizzcon points or winning tournaments you can still play it to and in legend and it performs acceptably if not great. This being said if you want to absolutely maximize your win rate and that is your primary concern I would not recommend freeze mage currently. ,TheHearth,dbnalc0,1,t5_3ac51

I myself sometimes cut both Jaraxxus and Kazakus honestly in favour of straight removal and control cards so I can run the Leeroy combo as my main win condition. Both are cards that let you win the long run and cutting them means you have to change how you view the game as a whole you cant win control anymore but its doable. ,TheHearth,deskls1,2,t5_3ac51

11184054,0,t3_5zi644,Ive been working on this since MSOG release and have a list that I have brought to Rank . It still feels a little clunky but there is definitely something there.It looks like and aggro deck plays like a controlly combo deck where you do nothing T and T then you start drawing and buffing your minions. Fight back and get the board with your buffed minions start chipping away at their face and then combo them down.The trick is that you always need to be drawing so that your buff cards get amazing value and you can flood the board to keep control of it in the mid game. But not only drawing but using Finja to pull cards from your deck as well so that you are more likely to get your murlocs out and your Anyfin to be a threat. Small Time Finjafin  x Murloc Warleader  x Bluegill Warrior  x Argent Squire  x Abusive Sergeant  x Divine Favor  x Leeroy Jenkins  x Argent Horserider  x Sir Finley Mrrgglton  x Anyfin Can Happen  x Runic Egg  x SmallTime Recruits  x Finja the Flying Star  x Wickerflame Burnbristle  x Meanstreet Marshal  x Mistress of Mixtures  x Grimestreet Outfitter  x Grimestreet Enforcer  x Smugglers RunIm not sold on Leeroy though he has been key to win a couple games Sir Finley helps draw more or healarmor more but dilutes your Anyfin pool.Mistress of mixtures and Wickerflame are essential to survive against aggro because you do nothing T and T so you need their heals and trades in order to get the board back.,TheHearth,dezp747,1,t5_3ac51
11326575,0,t3_61l0yb,Druid of the Claw look super random.  I think I would want the second Nourish or Brann in that slot.,TheHearth,dffujyw,2,t5_3ac51
11328810,0,t3_61dia0,Ive found that using an OTK deck seems to beat them if u can curve out. Malygos rogue with Barnes and emperor ticks. Im using double counterfeit coins for cycling. ,TheHearth,dfg3o7h,1,t5_3ac51
11363015,0,t1_dfjxkg8,One of the first priorities is to make the decks as standard as possible. Deathlords and Healbots are really strong minions for the mill decks. The Dancing Swords are a cool addition but definitely not a must. ,TheHearth,dfjz5ib,1,t5_3ac51
11404423,0,t1_dfo80jv,I tried that do you find success with the red mana wyrm? I am missing van cleef too and it felt like a big loss,TheHearth,dfoodnz,1,t5_3ac51
11436007,0,t1_dfs97rt,This right here. Lots of new neutral AND class taunt minions should make a real dent in Pirate win rates. Were losing one of the strongest neutral healing cards but I dont think relying on Reno was healthy for the meta. Better to spread smaller healing across multiple cards and rely more on preventing damage in the first place. ,TheHearth,dfs9dji,3,t5_3ac51
11438981,0,t3_63aj89,People also mistakenly think that all aggro decks are basically on autopilot with no decisions.  While some of them Pirate Warrior some versions of Face Hunter did have pretty low skill ceilings some of them require a considerable amount of thought and decision making Aggro Shaman Tempo Mage.  Also people who really like long control matches tend to overestimate how difficult some of those decks are to pilotjust because it involves more decisions doesnt necessarily mean the decisions are harder.  My super greedy Reno Mage is a prime example.  Every decision I make with that deck revolves around do I want to make the tempo play now or bank on staying alive to outvalue with MedivhBrannKazSoulcasterReno?  Usually the decision isnt very difficult because the deck is slow to develop to begin with and by the time I have to start thinking about it I can usually identify what my opponent is running so I basically already know the answer,TheHearth,dfslj11,33,t5_3ac51
11463705,0,t1_dfv72x5,The card isnt unplayable but its not good. That list of stable cards includes a bunch of spells that I dont want to pay  mana for even with a  body. This will be a fun card to play in a Casino Mage deck but it wont see any play in any serious deck.,TheHearth,dfvejva,2,t5_3ac51
11496302,0,t1_dfyj9jn,Well I am sure you heard of the Birthday Problem. But I will explain it shorthand. Basically with about  people in a room there is a  chance  people share a birthday. With  people it is almost .This is surprising to people that dont know a lot about statistics. Same thing is happening here with lots of different numbers. Instead  days you have like  legendaries. Instead of  people in a room you are rolling  legendaries.,TheHearth,dfz3spe,2,t5_3ac51
11511266,0,t1_dg0ov21,I crafted it mainly for wild use but I think it will be plenty viable in standard. Probably couldve waited on crafting as I havent even played with it much since Ive been having so much fun with other archetypes but Im expecting it to be pretty powerful,TheHearth,dg0sy0l,1,t5_3ac51
11563050,0,t3_64v05z,Been playing some Malygos Druid in wild with the new Earthen Scales. Its a really good addition to the deck.,TheHearth,dg6odcc,1,t5_3ac51
