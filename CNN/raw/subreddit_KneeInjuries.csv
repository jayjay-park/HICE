7125,0,t3_1tld8w,Hey man. Good luck with everything. What I would do for the post surgery is get one of the ice packs that you can strap to your leg I think eastbay.com has them for sale I know for me it would have helped reduce any swelling. For the weight loss what I would recommend is changing your thoughts on food. If you start to think of food as energy in energy out you start to realise you wont need as much. Keep your mind active as well. If you can get a new game new book or a dvd series. When I did mine the Halo Reach beta was introduced and I had to entrie series of Buffy and Angle to watch. It made me stop thinking about how bad my situation was and just relaxed. Good Luck dude!,KneeInjuries,cef8xdu,1,t5_2yj3r
1204916,0,t3_27vrgv,I agree with uCheeseforyourLoaf. Go to a physio therapist and see if youre ready. There are a lot of different exercises you need to have been doing to get back the neuromuscular connection and balance. Your surgery is only as good as your rehab...remember that. Good luck!,KneeInjuries,ci56669,2,t5_2yj3r

6894414,0,t3_440ut1,Hey I have a similar problem in that my meniscus is highly worn down and very thin.  Doctor says that one of the best option is biomedical treatments like cadevor meniscus implants and bio genetic artificial that are grown in a lab.  He told me to check out this website Cryolife.,KneeInjuries,d0xstb6,1,t5_2yj3r
7583768,0,t3_4ibgyi,I had ACL reconstruction when I was . I had the surgery on a Friday morning and was back in school by the following Thursday uncomfortable but back. The major pain was the Sunday after the surgery and by that Thursday I was uncomfortable but not taking heavy medications anymore. Youre really only looking at a week off after that your leg will be immobilized in a large brace and you will be on crutches but able to go to school as long as you keep the leg elevated as much as possible. If I were you I would check into the physical therapy before you make your decision. Many offices are open until evening at least here in the States and therefore you could go after school. They also give you athome exercises youll be going fairly frequently the first four to six weeks to increase your range of motion and break up scar tissue maybe two to three times per week then it drops down to once per week and a lot of the work is on you to do the exercises youve been given. Im very active and play sports so it was a nobrainer for me to have the surgery personally. I know people who have elected not to have the surgery and never got it reconstructed and that works for their lifestyle. It wouldnt really work for mine. I think its a personal decision. The ACL doesnt heal itself so you really arent at risk of it healing wrong thats why you need surgery to repair it but you do put yourself at risk for other knee injuries due to its instability if you remain active because your main stabilizing ligament is out of commission.Feel free to PM me if youve got any questions about the procedure or the therapy afterwards! Its been about  years since I had the surgery and so far its held up fantastically through collegiate sports and beyond. ,KneeInjuries,d348k3s,1,t5_2yj3r
