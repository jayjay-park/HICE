835499,0,t3_23pdic,I very rarely ever sell originals however my buddy and his sister were recently punched in the face with medical bills after their father was diagnosed with leukemia. That fact that we are the last industrialized country to allow a family to go bankrupt when a loved one gets sick is beyond embarrassing and while subtle strides are being made to help resolve that the lobbyists have pretty much assured that it wont get resolved in this lifetime. So.... Im donating this original x watercolor to auction in hopes it helps them out of their bind. Size is x on lb. paper. Theyre running the auction through IG place your bid in the comments and again thank you all so much for your support HERES THE LINKIm also oneuglybastard on Insta.,Youngluck,cgz8yml,10,t5_2rv06
