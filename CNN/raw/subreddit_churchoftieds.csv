2547005,0,t1_cmr04q0,Can I state for the record that I think Neptulon is going to be the best card in GvG. PM willsctalk Neptulon will be the best card in GvG because it provides you with soooooooo many murlocs PM willsctalk Furthermore Vol Jin is overrated because typically murlocs are    health strong. So with the new murloc meta Vol Jin will be weak.,churchoftieds,cmr13w0,2,t5_358q2
