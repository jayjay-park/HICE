5037969,0,t1_cust0o2,What a ridiculous fake name. Youve actually gotten the trolls attention by trying to call her that and you can just tell that shes scowling at you from behind those big clunky steampunk goggles of hers. She informs you rather impolitely that her name is truly Velcha Milcom and then returns back to her potion brewing. Since she clearly doesnt care to expound on any of her interests for you and the concept of there being a you in the first place is rather abstract and confusing you decide not to bother her with it and decide to look around to room to find out about her interests for yourself.The CAULDRON is bubbling with some dark malevolent BREW and is suspended above a similarly bubbling lava pit by a chain on the ceiling. Right next to where Velcha is sitting over the potion are a NUMBER OF BOOKS including TOMES DETAILING OCCULT RITES and COOKBOOKS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CULINARY ARTS.  A number of other objects are around the room which itself is actually rather depressing being constructed of cold stone and lit by the dim blue light of a number of ENCHANTED TORCHES. There is a TRANSPORTALIZER that appears to be in a state of disrepair a NUMBER OF ODDLY SPECIFIC SHRINES Velchas HUSKTOP of course a pair of shackles hanging from the ceiling and an unusual MUCUS MEMBRANE she uses to keep her lusus from mucking up anything outside of the tunnels she built specifically for it. Of course since shes not actually describing these things to the uncomfortably omnipresent voice that wont leave her alone it doesnt actually really know what any of these things are for. Theyre just kinda there.There is also a window whose shutters are closed implying to all the world that Velcha is not in the mood for visitors. She glares at you even though as an abstract manifestation of game narrative you do not have a physical presence as if trying to get you to take the hint the shutters are giving.,RPGStuck_C3,cut9m2v,1,t5_39r2j
