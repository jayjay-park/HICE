Unfortunately the first person that I selected to do the logo took my cash and then I never had any more communication back from them. Cant say I was happy with that but I took my chances and took one of the other offers up and got a good result.  Dont Know if I should name and shame the person that took my cash and then never got back to me.  I just hope that he is not doing this to others.  ,logorequests,dbt3ssk,1,t5_2sjo8
