5146974,0,t3_3lh6ol,Arena is just the same game renamed. If you have the original core set youre fine. Academy is a smaller shorter version of the game that takes out the board and removes conjurations. Also you cant use cards from Arena in Academy but you can use Academy cards in arena.I got Academy from gen con and its really good for teaching new people the basics of Mage Wars but the intention is that they move on to Arena.Then there is Battlegrounds which adds a new battlefield and a new objective to the game. A sort of area control version of the game where you take over orbs to earn points and first person to a certain amount of points wins.Some are worried these  ways to play will further split up an already small player base. I hope thats not the case.,magewars,cv6ejd5,2,t5_2v5gd
