9281144,0,t3_57gou4,It depends on how much the floor changes.... If its a half inch Id grind it out. Its going to be a lot of work and youll need to get plenty of face masks. Concrete dust isnt what you want to breathe. But if its more Id pour less concrete than four inches. Like a topping cost. But without seeing it its a hard judgement call honestly.

11087640,0,t3_5yb9uj,. You want to tie the  slabs together. With a  masonry bit drill  into the existing slab boring out the holes a little bit when drilling.  Hammer a  piece of  rebar into each hole and do this every . MAKE SURE YOU DRILL YOUR HOLES STRAIGHT IN NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE EXISTING SLAB. When hammering the rebar in you can pop the concrete if the holes arent drilled correctly. No need for expansion felt. . No. Run your forms straight off your existing concrete.Conclusion. At the expense of sounding rude I want to let you know that your plan is not going to work unless you are a skilled finisher and since you are here asking questions Im guessing not. Mixing   bags at a time spreading it out closing it up and then finishing the entire slab before it gets hard is a lot of work for a skilled finisher much less a novice. You are going to need  yards of concrete and I recommend you have a concrete company bring it in a truck and use a sturdy wheelbarrow to dump it in. Find someone who knows how to finish concrete and has their own tools so you dont have to buy everything. Concrete is a skilled trade for a reason and not something you should tackle without experience. Its could end up a costly lesson.Good luck ,Concrete,deorvsy,2,t5_2rsvj

So I have   of my slab already poured and out comes at least  gallons of watery cement.
