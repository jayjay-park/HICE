1365588,0,t3_29dwyc,that guy looks totally amazed.  i would be too.,Sup,cings1u,1,t5_2rwog
1375562,0,t1_cio96hl,All good buddy. Its a fair bit of money to be putting out at first but well worth it. And dont forget if you decide to upgrade later it is going to be alot easier to sell a known Brand rather than a cheap board!,Sup,ciopoza,1,t5_2rwog
1676279,0,t3_2dko3w,My guess is he didnt die from drowning. Flat water and attached to a giant floaty thing?  Older guy probably had a massive heart attack. ,Sup,cjqggw7,2,t5_2rwog
2601055,0,t1_cmxzgh0,Honestly Ive never looked into the lawregulation regarding what can be in the water in those specific areas.  Its just what Ive always known.  I know Ft Lauderdale beach and Hollywood beach have designated areas.Is it possible that the municipalities can regulate what is on the beach not necessarily in the water?  I know Ive been told by the police that I couldnt have a bike on the sand.  It has to be on a bike rack.,Sup,cmy3g7s,1,t5_2rwog
4350484,0,t3_3audsu,Are you just gonna leisurely paddle around a harbor or lake? Thats what this would be perfect for but if youre gonna try and surf it you may end up with too much flex since its entirely foam. Look on Craigs list for used stand ups and youll probably find one thats only a bit more thats a real surfboard with fiberglass and everything haha.,Sup,csg15og,2,t5_2rwog
4377657,0,t1_csfxgii,My wife and I just paddled the Peconic on Wednesday it was really nice hard to believe that we were still on the island at certain points.,Sup,csj3itf,1,t5_2rwog
4476776,0,t3_3ccchp,The twobladed paddle is no longer the dumbest SUP innovation,Sup,csuyu0n,1,t5_2rwog
4604030,0,t3_3e2lo4,Generally you have more freedom with a paddleboard. You can sit stand kneel lay down ect.If you dont have a specific type of kayak in mind and just want to get out and play on the water I think a Paddleboard will be your best bet.,Sup,ctaxal2,2,t5_2rwog
4623916,0,t3_3ebnwz,I use DocksLocks. Ive had good luck with it. There is an option to lock in the finbox or another option to lock where you put the leash. ,Sup,ctdf2t9,2,t5_2rwog
4812173,0,t1_cu1285y,You seem to have issues.  You must be some middle age burned out logger who sucks at surfing nowadays. Keep stylin kook. And I also said Naish boards have carbon fiberGo ahead and point out the stringers and type of cloth they used to glass it too. ,Sup,cu144mg,1,t5_2rwog
5016597,0,t1_cup7053,False! Cheap tacos are the best. Unless they come from Jack in the Box.,Sup,cuqoux5,1,t5_2rwog
5078765,0,t1_cuy5ghm,Yeah but Ive been doing long strokes. Will try shorter in the future. Ive got an inflatable as well.Thanks for the insight!,Sup,cuy6ltc,2,t5_2rwog
5176282,0,t3_3lvfv0,Its trash. Especially since its a sup. There is so much flex on a sup due to the length that its essentially useless now. File a claim.,Sup,cv9xkfy,1,t5_2rwog
5235139,0,t3_3mmv6y,all the same chinese junk.  Nash Starboard are the best brands.,Sup,cvh0w6w,0,t5_2rwog
5482584,0,t3_3q4f2l,How are you transporting your board? Are you by chance cranking down on it with straps to secure it? I could see hairline fractures from pressure worsening over time then finally giving way. ,Sup,cwcg95v,3,t5_2rwog
6488010,0,t1_czjl2qz,This will certainly keep the bade from fluttering but at a big expense It wont allow you the feather the blade for a clean release and wont allow you to skim the paddle for balance so not for me.,Sup,czqeprx,1,t5_2rwog
7421840,0,t3_4env3i,I am planning on getting a Kayalite SUP version which can mount on a leash plug or dring. ,Sup,d2ltcft,1,t5_2rwog
8019620,0,t3_4oz668,What kind of water will she be in? Will she be doing any other water sports that require a PFD? Specifically kayaking? I wear the Astral Green Jacket. Incredibly comfortable full range of motion on the SUP or in a kayak decent sized pouch for gear attachment points for rescue gear and a ring thats on a quick release that I can hook my paddleboard leash to. Im riding primarily whitewater. Chasing your boat down river can be rough. The rings primary purpose is to tow others in rescue situations. Plus its a class V pfd. After trying a few on I wouldnt look anywhere else. Its pricey but its meant to save your life. ,Sup,d4hhauo,2,t5_2rwog
8337607,0,t1_d5jr0bx,Sorry but in every picture you posted the paddle is being held backwards. Turn it around and youll feel the difference and give whoever taught you that a slap on the head. ,Sup,d5jr79j,3,t5_2rwog

9565366,0,t3_5bxr89,Theres a Groupon for the Crown Cove Aquatic Center on Silver Strand for about  for . hours and all gear included. I did it a few months ago and had an awesome time. I got lucky too and it was only me so pretty much a private lesson. We went south through the Coronado cays area and back. Even had some free time after. Downside is you cant rent from there only take the . hour lesson. ,Sup,d9s4lbf,2,t5_2rwog
9654739,0,t3_5dafwo,The wider the board the more stable it will be so Id be looking at a good allaround or recreational SUP instead of a more slender touring style SUP. Dont be afraid of inflatables. Good quality ones can save you lots of dough versus a traditional SUP and are perfectly fine for casual paddling. Also you can usually find decent deals on used boards on Craigslist or other such sites or local shops might be do consignment for people trying to sell their boards. Good luck and happy paddling!,Sup,da35blk,1,t5_2rwog
11612143,0,t3_65p4kr,Youre going to want a LOT of volume at your size. Im about  and paddle with a lb dog while we have three iSups only our biggest one works for me and the dog together. Its a  C Outfitter the cheaper version of the iTrekker here I think that would work really well for you and as a prioryear close out its within your budget. ,Sup,dgc8vnj,1,t5_2rwog
