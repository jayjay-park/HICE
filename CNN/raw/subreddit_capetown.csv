3291170,0,t1_coxc3j9,Unfortunately I left Cape Town because of work at the start of the year but I would recommend living there to anyone. As with most places in South Africa do your homework about which area you choose to live in particularly relating to crime. Dont get me wrong in general its not all that bad but it does very much depend on the area youre in  Constantia  Tokai is good if youre wanting somewhere sort of suburban GreenPoint is in the city centre which is good for if youre looking for a young vibey place with a lot of night life otherwise Observatory is a less expensive but more artsy place to live Vredenhoek is also quite youthful and close to town. Kommetjie and Scarborough are lovely if youre looking for somewhere more quiet and relaxed with a lot of nature around. Check your job options career opportunities very much depend on what sector youre looking to go into and theres too wide an array of possibilities for me to go into different ones now. From a cultural perspective South Africans are a generally friendly lot and as long as youre friendly and genuine youll be welcomed. I dont think we get offended easily so dont stress too much  Cape Town actually has a large number of people living there from all over the world so most locals are used to foreigners faux pas and it is a truly multicultural place ...just dont get us started on talking about politics and race lol. No actually well talk about it for ages but its one of those things of dont try to change peoples opinions were pretty set in our ways but then I think this is true no matter where you are in the world.Not sure what else to comment on but let me know any questions and Ill try to help best I can ,capetown,cp3f4no,1,t5_2r3ap

3364382,0,t1_cpbqb1h,gt Why would you draw that as a logical conclusion?Its a reasonable conclusion.  Thats why it ends in a question mark.  If we are talking about a pie and out of nowhere you remark about the pies taste in a positive manner its reasonable to conclude that the pies taste had some positive effect on you.  It would also be reasonable to conclude that a tastier pie would be even better unless you have a reasonable objection hence the question mark.  These are not logical conclusions but very reasonable ones.gt You asked both and the answer is the same for both.Its impossible for your answer to be the same.  If something has no effect on you you would not even know of its existence.  Since the only effect the statue had on you is its existence in your experiential sphere one could argue that you could be inspired by any object you observe.  But since we are not that obtuse we accept that the inspiration was most likely due to it being a statue of a historical figure.  Which leads me back to the point where if historical inspiration is your only argument we can reasonably conclude that other statues exist which will serve to not only inspire you but others as well in deeper and broader ways.,capetown,cpbrjmt,0,t5_2r3ap

6369393,0,t3_42ssqd,The problem is that the DA governing the Western Cape doesnt control the police force and cannot deploy more resources to the violent areas. Since the ANC national government is in charge its unfortunately in their best interests to constantly reduce the amount of resources sent to the Western Cape to give the impression that the DA is failing. Helen Zille wrote about this at length last yearThe national average for the distribution of police officers is one for every  citizens. The ratio in Khayelitsha is .  In the neighbouring Harare precinct its  in Nyanga  and in Mitchells Plain .These are the precincts worst affected by violent crime yet they are the most underresourced by SAPS despite our repeated requests to rectify this imbalance. Surely the areas that constitute South Africas murder capital should have additional resources not fewer?,capetown,czdmpae,7,t5_2r3ap
