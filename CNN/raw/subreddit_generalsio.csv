9855235,0,t3_5gh49k,All his are the same person. The blue hi just didnt do anything untill if the green hi found out where my general was. The blue hi was close and he had like  troops by then so he bee lined it for my general. Then the two his merged afterward. I didnt notice they had the same name at first so I didnt think anything of the inactive player.Platinummmmm is in on it as well but I am pretty sure he is another person.,generalsio,das5rrt,5,t5_3hlt1

10535841,0,t1_dd1pdug,I havent been losing any more games than usual  vs  I dont really play too much ffa and Im starting to come down on the side of not liking the new movement.  Aggression was already strong and weve just removed part of the defenders advantage.  I think when people fully adapt to the new movement its going to make playing defensively a nightmare.  Just an initial feeling.  Could be wrong.,generalsio,dd2cr3g,0,t5_3hlt1

11220917,0,t1_df3ud9f,Id say that on a bo series spawn luck is fine. Mulliganimg spawns is an idea but would be a hard and confusing thing to implement. I am not for bad spawn rules it would faster be an officially implemented game map generation rule than a tournament one time wasting and confusing too.,generalsio,df3vktz,1,t5_3hlt1
