4716633,0,t3_3fbs4e,I dont really enjoy rSoundersFC. There are some good posters on there but its also a lot of armchair tacticians talking about signing a DP forward because we can move Dempsey to CAM or the occasional SigiOut actually getting upvoted like last night and right now. It used to be a good sub when it was a bit smaller but Im finding myself not going there nearly as often anymore. ,mlslounge,ctp2ja5,1,t5_390fo
