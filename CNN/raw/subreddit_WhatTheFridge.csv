Steam all of them in a covered skillet maybe with a little soy sauce or vinegar.While either of those two things are cooking make a dry crumbly dough starting with  parts flour to  part milk. Add in some of that cream cheese probably some of the others too. Add a little bit of butter or oil totally depends on how much cream cheese you put in and some basil oregano rosemary sage whatever you like coconut might be kind of good cant say that Ive tired it. You should end up with a dry dough that tastes like cheese and forms little balls that break apart easily like the consistency of streusel although there should be no fine particles. Set that aside for now.Make a light roux sorry more flour and add milk possibly the coconut milk as well unless its sweetened then its probably too sweet. Toss your vegetables and your chicken together with whatever seasoning you like Id go for parsley rosemary worcestershire sauce onion powder and lemon zest based on what you have and then add your white sauce. Stir it up check that it is seasoned to your satisfaction then put it in a casserole dish or deep skillet cover with your little balls of dough in a pebbled pattern there should be gaps in the dough but you dont want to be able to see through to any large areas and bake it in a F  oven until your crust is browned probably no more than  min and most likely less.,WhatTheFridge,cfj1i0f,1,t5_2yjkx
391813,0,t1_cflcvsi,I dont have any ricotta or greek yogurt at the moment but I could maybe add some. I do have some tomatoes I believe do you think I should cook them into the mix or dice them and put it on top after?Bread is just a generic loaf of wheat bread I think rice pilaf sounds like a good compliment Ill go with that I dont have much experience in cooking stuffed chicken do you have any recommendations on temperaturetiming? Thanks for the advice!,WhatTheFridge,cfldle7,1,t5_2yjkx
