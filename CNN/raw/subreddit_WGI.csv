3698117,0,t1_cq9scik,Im mutual friends with their quad tech real shame what happened. As soon as they plugged at prelims they blew out their mixer.  Since the first  seconds of their show is keyboard they plugged in directly to the board that starts the show.  Unfortunately the show started at  which is why the went grossly over time.  If they hadnt had a timing penalty theyd still be on the bubble.  Who knows how well theyd have done if they had their show with all their sounds?  They were probably finals contenders in a really really strong PSO field.,WGI,cqdt68i,1,t5_2snns

So uh... if anyone happened to record the Finals run from last year would you mind hitting me up?But to answer your question Matrix Open operates essentially like the World group does but with a slightly less dense rehearsal schedule and a less advanced skill set.,WGI,ddgy519,1,t5_2snns
