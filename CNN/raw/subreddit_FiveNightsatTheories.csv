4190599,0,t3_2x0s0l,Honestly I think that the animatronics were talking about the Purple man in the Fnaf  trailer. He will come back meaning that the Purple man will come back to kill again. He always does the death Minigames in Fnaf  tell us that this guy is just plain crazy. There is a dead kid in EVERY ONE OF THOSE MINIGAMES. If I was one of the killer robots I would be prepared for his return too. We have a place for him Theyre planning on finally getting their revenge and stuffing him in a suit like he did. In other words they have a place for him in the Fazbear family.,FiveNightsatTheories,crxxesj,1,t5_36x8j
