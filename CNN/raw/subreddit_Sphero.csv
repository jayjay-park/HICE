6202455,0,t1_cytxwno,Thank you so much for replying to my comment so fast. You dont know how happy I am to finally get some help from other than Spheros useless customer service. I bought it from the Sphero website. The main problem with Sphero is that I sent multiple tickets to their customer service. They always reply with an automated message of potential solutions. Then they automatically marked my ticket to Solved. Immediately I tried to reopen the ticket and tell them their solution dont work. Have not received any response from them yet.,Sphero,cyuniok,1,t5_2t0aj
