6530210,0,t3_446lxg,For what its worth to ya I have four systems and play virtually every day  when given options like this I pick each option on a different system.  Theres never really been any crazy differences in the script every one seems to get to the same dialogue two screens or so later.,badgearcade,czurx61,1,t5_3aqzn
6568878,0,t3_458cmb,Two days ago I got three free plays. Used it to get DaisyRosalina and a bunch of coins I guess and used the last one to try and get Mario. Nope. Yesterday I got four again tried to get Toad got a star instead then tried for Peach failed and Mario twice and again nope. Today I got four again spent three trying for Luigi no luck again and then Yoshi which instead resulted in another star.I have never had so much luck with free plays yet of course I get horrible luck actually putting them to use for these sets.
