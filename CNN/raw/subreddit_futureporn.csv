5050571,0,t3_3k2qhf,This is really interesting and something that I wish the franchise had spent more time developing...the attempts of a machine to be convincingly human.  As much as Arnold effectively made Terminator great talking about  amp  I feel that hes also what made it stale and flat.  As failed as it was The Sarah Connor Chronicles  I guess tried something different with a Ghost In the Shell sort of feel to it.  In other words Ive always found the different actors that played Terminators pretty interesting and was fascinating to speculate how a machine could blend in and disguise itself as being human....a half formed thought here would appreciate some input Terminatoredditors,futureporn,cuus9z9,8,t5_2tczh

7460457,1,t1_d2q74i3,Sure sure. I think its a little silly to stretch to make up excuses to hand wave away relevant criticism of the work.If its not our timeline then why bother calling it  at all?If its not our timeline did they just arrive at the aesthetic style of the s and say Thats it! Were done!If its not our timeline what happened to make snow warm?If its not our timeline what invention allowed for those other family members to float over to where they are?Im familiar with this artist. Ive seen much of his other stuff and like it quite a bit. I dont like this. Ive also seen other works like this where its effective a historical scene with one futuristic component put into it.

7461073,0,t1_d2q8ukv,Yes it very much is a common thing in art and writing. Im saying YOU are using it as a shitty excuse.
