943368,0,t1_ch93974,FYI Anch is Spirit masks Assassin is Luck Amulets.As for the bossing goes youre fine to leave the sents in another area they do not need to be near the boss when it dies to get a drop. Size of group seems to play a factor but  people is good enough for a reasonable drop rate. Hands are somewhere around  rate from my experience. ,nexustk,chbimzv,2,t5_2stuw

2481975,0,t1_cmiia0u,What is the background of this problem just out of my own curiosity? I never remember it as a problem in the early years of the game. Is Kru aware of it?,nexustk,cmij6f4,2,t5_2stuw
5217131,0,t1_cveei6m,In honest your post didnt really give much to go on I would say start by saying the things in current NTK you enjoy about the PK system and the elements from that which are missing in ETK. These have to be things other than class balancing purely because that is always going to be an ongoing issue. For myself Having been born in Yuri  which is going back a good while the PK systems are pretty much the same to me. Thats my view. ,nexustk,cveuuni,1,t5_2stuw

5966907,0,t1_cy1h0ye,Its got you looking like a fool if you think thats my motivation. Im not sure what effort youre talking about though.  cumulative minutes posting on reddits not a big deal. My main motivation is that youre turning the real problem KRU into a petty witch hunt against Archons whom you dont seem to know the real identities of but are more than willing to tar your suspects. If you want to improve things in Nexus this kind of petty bullshit isnt going to do the trick.Im not going to expose the actual people who are mostly working hard to improve the game despite the headwind which is utter apathy from KRU just to prove a point on an anonymous forum. And since I still play the game and would rather not be banned Im not going to share anything that could bite me in the ass. But whatever you havent provided any explanation or evidence for your identifications and I know theyre wrong despite your apparent certainty. I dont have an obligation to counter something youve pulled out of your ass and Im not interested in doing it. People who read it can determine for themselves whether your whistleblowing is legit knowing that someone who has actual experience with the inner workings of the system says its not.,nexustk,cy1sk0f,1,t5_2stuw
6000323,0,t1_cxuw1q0,ChaeRi checking in. Can confirm not all this info is verified. Source ChaeRi.I cant go into detail about my stories that would back this up without breaking Nexus rules but I will try to say what I can.First off is the favoritism is real. There are a lot of different things Ive seen that I wish I could tell you more about but its certainly a real thing. Part of it has to do with very objective based goals and having a narrow scope of solutions as a result of being out of touch speculation.Secondly saying that those in power dont care for any change. Oh I do care. My barrier is the same as yours. To clarify my job is strictly roleplay based. I have no interaction with the GM.That being said I have and always will work with people trying to make roleplay events happen when it concerns Nagnang. While Ive been very busy these last few months I try to be very accessible to those who want to be in contact. The barrier here is when things require GM interaction. Someone else said it is really a lack of effort from KRU and I feel like this is the biggest part of it speculation. I used to write events I had a ton of them written and I would always be dissuaded by a rather unclear schedule of events that I have never seen with an excuse like oh but we have  coming up in this month.Lastly if you could come up with a clear and concise criticism about anything Ive done I would like to hear it so I can try to improve upon it. Try not to be jaded when it comes to getting in touch with at least me.I might edit and touch this up a bit when Im not typing from my phone. Cheers.,nexustk,cy668gn,3,t5_2stuw

9072640,0,t1_d8203de,Having to pay for spells in an MMO? Maybe Im out of touch but that sounds ridiculous to me.At the end of the day progression unlocks skillsspells in just about every MMOARPG and many people have gotten used to paying for progression so its not all that different. This is just poor design though in that it takes the fun out of experiencing progression.Wony doesnt really get how MMOs work and what makes them fun.,nexustk,d82du72,2,t5_2stuw
9840094,0,t1_daq5mmu,Again you sidestep my statements completely. I pull quotes and address them directly. You dont. That makes me better at this than you by default.You cant say theres nothing to acknowledge when I just gave you a clearcut statement that you can either agree with or refute.gtA retro server is a classic way to put little effort into getting more money out of former players.Address this. The statement is either true or false. Tell me Im right or explain why Im wrong. If you cant do the latter that usually means the statement is true.If the statement is true then its certainly in the realm of possibility considering the scummy moneygrabbing stuff Wony has done recently. Therefore my argument is far from nonexistent.I really love when you reply. Every post is like a bitesized snack for me to devour!,nexustk,daq6rbb,0,t5_2stuw

X should be  Y should be .This will encourage event hosting and event participation. Since event can be both RP and non RP this will introduce people to RP without forcing them to.I think this is way more culture than creative english writing which is totally not a culture in ancient korea and pressing shift  shift  shift  macros x,nexustk,dfvpi9u,5,t5_2stuw
