37778,0,t1_cehp4lw,In games where speed is a factor larger maps and teamsizes larger than v work out. For instance Tribes is played from v to v though that is a bit of a shitfest. v is the most popular.If youre thinking v is the max youre probably thinking about slower games like CounterStrike. Titanfall seems to be a faster paced game with some speedmomentum aspects of it where you can traverse maps much faster. Larger team sizes might become a mainstay depending on the gametypes were playing map sizes in general in the game will there be larger maps? and how the teamsizes affect the flow of the game. If youre thinking from an eSports and LAN perspective then v is probably the max but I dont think this is as important as a large online competitive scene.,titanfall,ceiqdbm,1,t5_2xh0g

323546,0,t3_1xssmd,If you play Titanfall like CoD youre gonna have a bad time. He didnt double jump or wallrun a single time in that entire video. When the game was over and he reached the epilogue he just stopped moving. That already solves two of his complaints when titans are out all the pilots will be on the roofs and bots on the ground so you will feel as if the pilot v pilot game is gone and bots are the only thing there. You also have to at least try to destroy titans and you cant and shouldnt be able to do that with melee. He leaves the titan not called in for several minutes instead of just setting it to follow him and he complains about how the titan combat lacks depth as he completely ignores dash and the vortex blocker instead opting for five successive punches.Melee is also just not as suited to Titanfall since its much easier to get close to someone on a D plane rather than a vertical open map. Not being able to see enemies while cloaked is a more valid complaint but most players see them fine as a pilot even Driftr seems to have had no issues and hes been transparent ha about visibility issues due to colorblindness etc. before and its a necessary factor to balance pilots against titans.TLDR Titanfall is not fun if you stay glued to the ground and solely melee with occasional titan hipfire. What a surprise.EDIT Sorry he double jumped twice to get onto a roof right after he saw a teammate do it at . After that nothing.,titanfall,cfeb168,19,t5_2xh0g

That doesnt help us gamers out in the end when some of our population is taking the pressure off the devs shoulders. I wish theyd understand that.

338744,0,t3_1xz0cc,Ive been playing it on pc and am absolutely loving it. Maybe its because Im mainly a console guy that I dont notice this stuff but IMO the game looks fucking beautiful and the mouse stuff doesnt really affect me because I have been playing with a controller.  The only thing I dont really like is how dumb the bots can be I mean I dont need them to be crazy difficult but I shouldnt be able to kill them quite as easily as I have been. I dont mind it being like a cod game because i like the cod games and this basically feels like an awesome cod game with mechs and freerunning and an almost firefly like setting. I am loving this game Im actually gonna preorder the collectors edition,titanfall,cffvq9p,0,t5_2xh0g

339196,1,t3_1xz2xx,Its odd that titanfall was being held on a pedestal as being the reason to buy an xbox one when everything Ive seen thus far has pointed to the PC version capably destroying it in every corner of quality once they fix the raw mouse input and weird FPS cap issues itll be a pretty good port honestly. Its a shame though because the weapons seem based around console gameplay. Does anyone use the sniper rifle? the SMG? the AR piledrives both of those at any range its possible to actually see people at with the small maps why bother? Any console guys chime in are they useful when everyones on a controller?EDIT couple of issues Id point out from a PC balance perspective. theres no penalty for ADADADADseems one of the best strats is to vibrate from side to side with the ADAD pattern doesnt seem to affect your accuracy or killing potential whatsoever but makes you way harder to hit. map design seems to affect gameplay very little all the buildings are around  stories tall with some open bits inbetween them on fracture theres big sections of the map that go unused as theres no point ever being there Ive never seen anyone run into those zones on purpose. The maps have to be designed to suit  different sizes of foot soldier so they seem to suffer for it map knowledge seems to be barely useful. longevity item treadmill aside the game doesnt seem to have that much of a skill ceiling sound is useless etc the guns have no recoil a lot of the mechanics put in place to heighten the skill ceiling of FPS arent really present here team play is not really a thing either its generally  lone wolves vs  lone wolves theres very little incentive to be in a group because the hectic motion actually makes people being near each other a bad thing.  I dont think the core gameplay is necessarily something you can come back to and have fun for years and years just based off the beauty of the balance like you can in a lot of other FPS games the mechanics just dont seem to be there.  Beyond XP ranks and making you dole out guns in a slow matter to keep you hooked I dont feel the longevity is there I hate item treadmills. Snubbing servers and user content for reasons I cant understand okay fairo maybe you cant be fucked putting out a map maker for it soon as you probably modified hammer a bit to do it or have your own proprietary version or whatever. Why no user dedicated servers? this is gonna tie both in with longevity and my last point which is price User maps and custom servers would be a fucking godsend for this game and if as per a respawn tweet a while ago you dont plan on having microtransactions why would you be so against it? theres no microtransaction map packs to worry about losing money out of surely? User maps could add so much extra longevity and community to a game with decent core mechanics like say some surf styled parkour race levels with skilled timing and jumps or what not. Thatd be fun and the users will make hundreds of them if you let them. So theres  reasons and  reason I dont see as likely why they wont do that. . The tweet spefically stating no microtransactions means no cosmetics but still map pack DLC later Im expecting it to be honest. Microsoft doesnt want people to know the power of the cloud is just your normal old server. . THE POWER OF THE CLOUD IS REAL AND NORMAL SERVERS WOULD EXPLODE AT THE MERE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO RUN BOTS TOO. doubt it Why am I so fucking mad about the servers? In australia they dont plan on releasing the game with local servers so its crazy ping or nothing. In an online only game. Now consider the fact that the game costs  dollars in australia is online only and will have no reasonably acceptable servers for us to play on...but wont let us just run our own to fix that...then they possibly want us to buy map packs after that  dollar investment for a game that wont even work properly.Thats too much. Other games of similar graphical fidelity and input dont cost that much Natural selection  is  bucks on release they built their own engine from the ground up for it and everything and it looks fantastic plus they have user run dedicated servers for that too. They even updated it with maps for free after that. Then thats competing in the same space as an  dollar game with no dedicated servers and no servers in our actual region to play it on. Effort wise doesnt feel any more AAA than NS does either. Not good enough IMO this game has appeal I dont like seeing it wasted like this. ,titanfall,cffxews,-3,t5_2xh0g

341688,0,t1_cfg5i13,I really wouldnt care about having to use vsync to get  fps because I usually use vsync anyway but with the games vsync being brked too its pretty frustrating.I tried disabling the in game vsync and forcing triple buffered vsync with radeon pro but it just made it even worse. still jitteringmicrostuttering but now its locked at  fps because the game has that ridiculous artificial cap whenever the in game vsync is disabled. I see tons of other people reporting these issues too both amd and nvidia hardware.The game is in beta but ive seen WAY too many PC games with very obvious technical issues in beta just to have the exact same issues present in the final release. And combine that with the fact that respawn said on twitter paraphrasing that they feel the game is already ready for release and that the beta is just to test the MS cloud stuff does not fill me with confidence but I hope im proven wrong.

Your first  would actually be  or lower in the system presented by the OP. In the end the team that held the majority of the points for the largest amount of time wins so the battle draws out until the percentage of time with the teams having the majority of the points is completely fair.

361487,0,t3_1y86da,I do not agree with an increased player count at all. In the two maps we have now  players would be a huge clusterfuck of everyone stepping on each others toes and it would also slow the gameplay down quite a bit. I dont think this is what the devs want for the game. Also Titans would have to be rebalanced shield and armor wise due to more threats and that is a very fickly thing to do. Maybe would work as v but I am skeptical about even that. You have the bots but they do not behave move and use the map like human players do and they die near instantly that is why the map does not appear too crowded. ,titanfall,cfi8fll,3,t5_2xh0g

365768,0,t1_cfimdfp,Actually thats incorrect. I dont hurt the team. I carry it more often than not. Its a  vs  arena. When I pull off a triple kill Ive just put half their team out of commission. When I sit on the rooftops of angel city waiting to encounter one or two transients heading to A or C and kill them Ive just put a momentary halt to that entire teams effort at capturing our rear point. When youre out there pushing a point in a titan fighting by the skin of your teeth youll be glad that Im there hunting red indicators on the map because I just saved you from a pilot ripping through half of your armor. The reality is you need people like me who focus on doing the killing so that people like you who focus on capturing the hard points can find the job less overwhelming. The people who are hurting the team are the individuals who are good at neither. You know the ones what run off to chase the trail of a distant pilot the ones who sit there farming minions and the ones who wont even hop out of a titan to defend a point. ,titanfall,cfiodve,2,t5_2xh0g

407374,0,t3_1yqco8,The movement is different from any FPS i have ever played.  You have two jumps and by holding sprint and jumping at a wall you can run along the wall for short period of time.  It is possible to jump to multiple surfaces and stay on the wallin the air for a pretty long time.  It makes the game very fast paced and basically any objectbuildingland form in the map is fair game to jump on top of.  On top of this awesome parkour running you have the titans.  They really feel like an extension of yourself rather than a vehicle to drive around.  Titan gameplay is just as fun as pilot gameplay.  The other big difference is that there are AI allies and enemies in every game.  Each team has a number of grunts basic human soldiers and spectres combat robots in the map at any time.  They arent very tough enemies but they definitely help make the game feel more alive like its a real battle happening. Plus they give the newbad players something to shoot at and make them feel like they are contributing.  I havent had as much fun in a FPS in a long ass time and it was only the beta.

439095,0,t3_1z0el2,Think you hit the nail on the head OP. This game really reminds me of Halo in its simplicity. All I used in the Beta was the carbine and that made me happy. I wasnt looking for different weapons or more gadgets I was focused on becoming a better titan pilot and learning how to correctly move in this game. Honestly shooting feels like a secondary action I feel that the best players will be the best at parkour. Thats what makes this game so interesting for me its a FPS that doesnt focus on the guns and somehow makes it work.So when people point at the low number of weapons or how the classes are built like CoD or how the weapons are like lasers I just dont care. I think theyre missing the point to this game. The simple wallrunning and double jump mechanics are easy to learn but will take a lifetime to master. That is the purpose of being a pilot and if you dont get that you dont get titanfall.,titanfall,cfq9zli,1,t5_2xh0g

Its just some guy or girl sitting at a computer who is there to handle minor problems utilizing software that gives them extremely limited access to your account. The support people arent in any control of the company and they arent the ones who pass out bans or anything like that.

531107,0,t1_cg0mn2u,by foot is WAY more difficult. you are not only being hunted by titans but also by pilots. when you are in a titan you dont really care about pilots at all. In addition you also take a lot longer. In a titan it really only takes a few seconds and you are home.I mean you are still not alone as the flag carrier and bottle necks might be there but how often are you able to estabhlish that. This is a lot of theorycrafting but during a battle it is still just this one guy speeding through the map in a stryder with your flag.I think flag carrying for pilots only would add a lot more depth in ctf,titanfall,cg0n6ve,5,t5_2xh0g

533839,0,t3_2096r0,While working on that Titanfall benchmark yesterday and helping a lot of you with settings optimization via PM or otherwise I was also actively working on this quick post. In an ideal world I really wanted to use macro recordings to precisely replicate my actions with each version of the graphics settings but unfortunately it seems that DirectX API is a little too low on the stack and the mouse input control cant be passed through to DirectX. This meant I had to manually replicate the steps as well as possible. Im determined to find a way to force mouse macro input through  Im sure its possible I just havent had enough time to research it. If anyone knows how to do this Id love to hear what you think. Ive tried numerous programs and havent had much success yet though keyboard input worked so I was considering trying to force the arrow keys as mouse look.Anyway these screenshots sort of show that after low resolution textures theres not a lot of visible difference. I know its been covered back in the beta but I wanted to revisit it with the finalized game and also showcase some video of the graphics differences sidebyside. Again the video wasnt perfect due to manual input but I did try to replicate as closely as possible. I also showed what the game would look like using our K amp low settings when we benchmarked then put them up against insane max settings that we used when benching discrete cards.So... if anyone has advice on macro recording please tell me! Id also like to encourage everyone to share their own thoughts and results on this! My test methodology is by no means perfect for something like this I specialize in SSDs RAM and GPUs  game graphics comparisons are new for me but very fun! so if youve got suggestions for next time please lay it on me.Last time we had some awesome reporting on FPS with various hardware settings that spurred some great discussion so I wanted to point that out and thank everyone. Maybe we can do that again!Edit Oh and if youve got other testing ideas for me to run on Titanfall or other games Im open to suggestions. rbuildapc has shaped a lot of our test methodology for hardware but gamesspecific testing is new for the site with Titanfall. So its wide open for community feedback and developmentadvancement.,titanfall,cg0yd4y,2,t5_2xh0g

If you dont like playing just to play then a game is not meant for you. In RPGs unlockingfinding gear is a means to an end. Get that awesome gear advance in the story.

539646,0,t3_20bl7c,Subsequent kills dont decrease future build timers but you only decrease build time when you dont have a titan in play.  Id say keep your streak running if youve got one.

539966,0,t3_20bfyp,I agree...  Slightly.  I challenge you to find a modern competitive AAA FPS that has nearly the same amount of polish this has in terms of game play.  BF?  I still havent played literally one game of it since launch where there wasnt something broken.  And Im not just talking about balance issues which are TERRIBLE...  a handful of guns out of dozens are the only worthwhile ones.  Im talking about full scale game glitches that kick you from the game destroy visuals get you stuck in the ground fall through the map etc.  Sure its got more content but what good does that do if you cant play it.  Hell DICE cant seem to even fix any of the problems without making more of them.  Dont even get me started on how laughable COD has become.  And honestly if you are citing the campaign mode for COD as being a strength of the game...The part I agree with you on is that there are some things that are missing.  Critical things even.  Lack of matchmaking is on the verge of being inexcusable as well as no way to do private matches.  How can there be no private matches on a game that is all about freedom of movement!?  Think of all the awesome possibilities for custom game types with the well executed parkour.  Talk about frustrating.  However keep in mind that the problems with this game are easily fixed by patches.  And it sounds like Respawn is listening to the complaints.  Theyve announced they are implementing a matchmaking system as well as private matches.  More modes will obviously come with time.  I think a lot of these things are missing because they want to get things done RIGHT.  Id much rather them have nailed down fun exciting functional game play than spend months trying to get cool patches from Halo in there.  I think the game is being correctly reviewed on its current merits and future probable potential.  With that context I cant see how it doesnt deserve the s its been getting.  No other FPS has gotten close to the level of balance and polish this game currently has...  Which is even more incredible since it did it at LAUNCH.  I couldnt even get into a game of BF until a week after launch...Just some things to consider.,titanfall,cg1nfsj,2,t5_2xh0g

A grunt ran out from cover right in front of me at nearly eye level  and upon seeing me fell back on his hands in a mad scramble to get away from the towering behemoth that was staring him down. His animations were filled with pure terror as he desperately scrambled to get back behind the cover he had just left. Needless to say he exploded in a cloud of red mist. The feels though.

Sure the refire delay is brutally long but on some maps  Demeter Relic etc.  a good wallrunning pilot can get to some pretty good spots. Its a weapon that only excels in certain modes and lacks in others.As an example in Hardpoint you can shut down open areas once youre used to the lead. I played a game just sitting on the tower base in Boneyard and racked up  Pilot kills just slaughtering anyone that tried to approach C. Its also useful for CTF but to me that mode is kind of broken as is due to the prevalence of Strider dash coring across the map.Comparatively however it is terrible for Attrition it just fires too slowly to be of any use at all against Grunts and Spectres.

602460,0,t3_21155q,May get flammed for this but to be honest Im not sure this is a great move. Many people seem to forget defending points is key in hardpoint after capturing them of courseI havent had a chance to play yet but I hope they increased the killing while defending a hardpoint score to at least counter this. That way those who sit on an unchallenged point get less than those who are actually doing fricken awesome and holding a heavily assaulted hardpoint who quite frankly deserve MVP on this game mode.The last thing this gamemode needs is people running around like headless chickens focusing on killing and not the damn objective. Defending needs to be encouraged regardless of a few players who vent on the internet moaning about campers who dont understand the hardpoint gamemode and failed to select a kill objective gamemode like Pilot Hunter.Maybe  was a bit to generous but  seems to be a tipping point to maybe making it not worth defending when we could do with a player or two holding each point. Even though I havent played with the new updated ruleset I think when it comes to Hardpoint Id be less likely to consider a defensive play when your unrewarded  on the scoreboard and endgame XP to make out your doing little when actually you can be doing a great service to your team.Some people will of course argue those sitting at the starting spawn point and doing nothing caused this which is likely one of the reasons but then again the first thing I tend to do when playing hardpoint after capturing the first point at team spawn is make my way round to the enemys original spawn point and take it as usually everyone is so busy with fighting over the  central point that they leave their original point unguarded. A  C while B is going no where for a while can give your team a good boost early on. So if someone did defend their original spawn point against my sneaky assault they were actually doing something useful for their team.,titanfall,cg8r4cu,7,t5_2xh0g

What that means is it is generally something that is intended to bring attention to the game rather than something that adds depth to the game.

680061,0,t1_cghkg8n,I do agree that they nerfed gooser a little too hard and personally would not have changed it but from respawns point of view it is not good to have the majority of your players hit a wall halfway through regenerating. This could demotivate them from going further and may cause some people to stop playing. That is not good for the community so I can see why they chose to nerf it. That being said the gaming community is full of hypocrites when it comes to stuff like this. Half the time you hear people screaming that games are way to easy and stuff like regeningprestiging is just how much exp you gain.

And same deal with Where are the other millions of people who play?  not everyone voices their opinionsconcerns on the internet.  Many will just quit playing which I dont think any of us nor Respawn want.gt After all it is a Beta.No its not.  Its an update to a LIVE game which everyone paid for.  Feedback is to be expected and hopefully Respawn is receptive  youre simultaneously calling it a beta and arguing that people need to quit giving feedback on it sucking.gt The system puts you in teams and depending on how the matches go they will be mixed up. But not after  game or . Give it more time.Also not true.  The system will drop the losing team and attempt to find another match for them.  There isnt a shuffle.gt There are still modes where the system is not impleneted yet like CTF or pilot hunter. Try them if you dont want to have hard matches.Those modes suffer from the issue which existed before the update  the skill matching is extremely loose and the matches are often insanely lopsided.  Thats what they were trying to fix by making it more restrictive.

Basically the lowest payer is the one who is used to determine what DLC is available. Dont like the idea of joining a random and loosing your stuff for a match? Join randoms through the new DLC only playlists where only people with the doc can join and if a friend who doesnt have the dlc can maybe do a match or three a day or something. It doesnt have to be an all or nothing shitfest as you think. There are easy ways to slightly tweak matchmaking to keep it from happening Halo  and Reach do it quite well.

If and when they eject theyre just right in front of you for the easy kill.

If youre good at rodeoing for kills do that with a slammerLMG otherwise equip a chain gun and make sure you stand far enough back and just shoot accurately with extended mags. Its not some kind of magic secret some people are going to disembark and you just have to deal with that. But if you cant get  kills then you dont deserve to go on IMO. Its an actual challenge and it sucks that people instead lobby them to make it easier.Obviously tons of people ended up finishing it so maybe the problem isnt the challenge and is instead you.

761344,0,t3_22uch6, from udulbatmeTickrate is rather low for what youd expect from a fastpaced shooter. So if Im getting the graph right you can get up to ms extra delay on top of your latency depending on when something happens and whether its input or output for your client.Besides that most weapons in this game are hitscan and those get compensated for lag. Someone with a ms latency fatally hitting you in his game session will retroactively translate to a legitimate kill even if in your time youve already passed that wall. Do note that this doesnt mean hes at advantage it just means that players dont have to account for lag while aiming like in the old times. If you and him were to be in a firefight and you both shot at the same time then your faster connection would still have the upper hand.And well about close quarters combat... its probably some clusterfucky combination of the two.

766733,0,t3_22x3r1,You almost never want to engage other Titans headon especially when their abilities are active. An Atlas will quickly tear through you and youre not going to be able to punch through the buffed shields on an ogre alone.In fact punching through enemies shields without losing your own takes a lot of finesse. It helps to think of yourself as Pilot . instead of a full Titan. Youre bigger all but immune to small arms and your weapons are far more deadly but head to head Titans can and will take you down.So be annoying. Piss people off. Leave smoke in choke points. Take potshots and run off. Hide behind the heavy titans. Dash around and change directions often. Its generally pretty clear what the enemy is using play to their weaknesses. Assume that nobody ever sees you as a threat. Count on them seeking you out as an easy kill then use that against them. I can all but guarantee theyll rush you well beyond the point that theyve lost the engagement.As a general rule you want to avoid confined spaces. You need to be aware of where you your teammates and your enemies are so you always have somewhere to retreat to. Circlestrafe dodge and kite enemies until theyre weak then rush them and dump everything you have into their face before they know whats happening. As long as they neglect autoeject you should be able to nab an easy execution. Stryders are the best Titans for executions because the enemy is likely to rush you anyhow and you are very likely to have a dash or two available to escape Titan explosions or nuclear ejections.The transition is likely to be jarring at first but stick with it. Learn to manage your momentum and your boosts your Titan will likely last much longer than you ever did in an Ogre.

Also make sure to kill the npcs because they will mark your position as well.Make sure to stay mobile if you get a kill move after a few seconds to make sure someone doesnt come looking for revenge. Stealth is a good ability to use because it makes it very hard for titans to see you and many players will often overlook you or hesitate a moment which can give you the upper hand.Power Cell is a good kit in conjunction with stealth it makes you able to use it about  more.Minion detector is good because it shows you where npcs are for easy kills and time reductions.I guess you can use any ordnance you like but I personally love satchel charges although arc grenades are also really good because they disorient titans and pilots and arc mines are useful for the same reason but they can help cover your back or hold objectives or choke points.,titanfall,cgui2hw,2,t5_2xh0g

821112,1,t3_23ip9v,I actually love these bans. There is no real competitiveness in the smart pistol. Just wait and shoot and you get a kill. True you can bounce around and it CAN be tough to follow people but not as tough as other weapons.Banning the shotgun is solely to stop campers from camping at the flag or around corners I think this is a response to banning OP satchels as satchels are sadly the best response to beating campers due to the MASSIVE range they have. HOWEVER Read it carefully. each team can have  person running with the shotgun. they just dont want everyone camping in a room with a shotgun. P Banning Satchels are good since they are ridiculously powerful as once again there is no REAL skill in throwing these into a room and blowing up everything and everyone in it. The only skill part with satchels is when youre at top momentum and youre doing a flyby with satchels. You need to know howwhere to throw to get it to go where you want. But past that there is no real skill with them.Dead man trigger is banned because there are no satchels.I sadly dont remember what matchtrigger is off of the top of my head so i cant comment on it. Stealthkit is banned probably because while yes you are not completely invisible to pilots being cloaked for extreme amounts of time is not very good for the overall gameplay ESPECIALLY if you just sit in a corner cloaked forever waiting for someone to run by or try to watch a hardpointflagweAll burn cards being banned is fine with me. This evens out the playing the field in a very good competitive way. Use your head and you can see why this would be good PStim only being banned in CTF is perfect. Ive seen videos of people using stim to cap flags EXTREMELY fast and it is nearly impossible to stop them. Meaning that this is a balance fix for them. Active radar pulse is good because being able to see your enemies through walls is extremely powerful and there is no way to counter it. No way to hide and if they are smart they can see which way you are facing or prep a headshot. I hate people using this skill in titanfall and i hate this skill in other games like halo . Forerunner vision or we it was calledAs for the titan bans it seems decent to limit the amount of titans i guess. The reasoning behind this is that  titans that can carry the flag is unstoppable in a short amount of time. Sure you can wear them down eventually but not immediately and you are almost for sure going to fall behind if you are against them. Meaning that with a bit of teamwork of the titans you just auto lose meaning bad for competitive gameplay and spectatorship. Mines i dont know well enough to comment on either. so i wont.Sooo overall i gotta say i like these bans If you read over them and think you can easily spot the reasons behind these bans and overall i think they are good for gameplay and the competitive scene. ,titanfall,cgxm26k,-1,t5_2xh0g

Surely matchmaking could have put me and maybe others from the  man team on the  to round it out but NO!That said when matchmaking just came out it worked like a dream.

And to see some huge problems in the game with a lack of support content campaign and story makes people say things that are not in line with idealist people who think every single game is good. You payed for this and the game should be good. When even new games like TF are messed up it means that the game industry really IS lacking some serious content. Its not the whining which is the problem it is the lazy companies who do not produce games up to nowadays standards. Take a look at the PC performance. It is laughably embarrassing with the stuttering tearing no fps etc etc. The developers get lazier with every year and people defending them are the ones that give them the excuse to keep doing so.

I remember when the newest game was circulating a message saying to go kill yourself was a daily occurrence.The early days of MW were the worst mainly because Im one of those people who messages people saying good game just because I like to. The amount of death threat replies I and my friends got was hilarious. Now its completely changed When I played MW a few months ago everyone in the lobby was extremely nice and people were having friendly conversations with each other over the mic.

947507,0,t1_chbtkz2,No. When I play ctf solo I usually start off playing defense for a minute or so until I get a feel for the enemy team. I realized that none of them were beating me often in gunfights and that my team was not capping flags. So I decided to go on the offense. Most of my kills that game were against pilots defending their own flag flag carrier kills or killing off pilots trying to get their flag back from me. Still not enough though. Games like that make me turn the game off for a while out of frustration lol,titanfall,chbzlq5,1,t5_2xh0g
948460,0,t3_24yjgj,Fleeing with the Titan is the one I agree with the most. I do this all the time since players are usually uber aggressive and bull rush with theirs. Use a trail of smoke and cluster missiles if he decides to continue pursuit using tight corners and alleys.Another nice technique I do is to prevent their charge with smoke then immediately shoot a cluster through the smoke and behind themtrapping them.

But playing with  once or twice we realised that it would be more fun for everyone to limit the size. But I guess that is because we actively seek balanced games. ,titanfall,chpbt6q,2,t5_2xh0g

Specters and grunts are shooting their weapons at you. Youre health is low and your stim is on cool down.IMC ground control SIR! Things are looking grim  of our pilots have been taken out. Whats left of our forces are being destroyed. We have request for an evac ship but its under heavy fire. of the remaining pilots just give us cover well take care  of the restRockets bullets and every anti Titan weapon you can imagine are flying around the map like theyll change the galaxy.Pilots are desperately struggling to fend off the impossible odds to fight another day. The auto Titan distracts the militia forces from the drop ship as it lands on the militia forces captain. Pilot grunts and specter yell out in harmony as their Militia leader falls. The IMC forces rush in desperation.The evac shields have been far gone and the primary thrusters are offline. The hyper drive is still functioning we just have to get higher. One of the IMC pilots says his Smuggled Stims has just enough power to push off the evac ship to get us to hyper space.Before anybody can question it the pilot jumps into the engine infection manifolds and the captain pushes the ship to take off. Everybody but one survives. The members of that evac squad always use stim now even when its not warranted. Not because if makes sense but in honor of the man who saved every pilot of that ship.

The only map I can think of where improv wasnt really an option was Dry Dock and that was just due to its hilow design.I would like to add though that if you use routes in Titanfall you are going to have a significantly easier time playing CTF.

I can lose myself in Battlefield. Titanfall I normally only play for  minutes.Although I would never call Battlefield a tactical shooter. I consider it slightly more tactical than TitanfallCOD games. I could understand Titanfall ruining Battlefield though. I remember playing for the first time in April. I wanted to doublejump and forgetting what stairs and tall building mean to a mere soldier.

1374757,0,t3_29ss7e,choose your weapon according to the map. triple threat when you expect more close engagements arc cannon for mid range mm for maps with long lines of sight. always choose your engagements accordingly go inside the ship where hardpoint B is on relic if you want to use the triple threat for example. use the atlas. the best of both worlds and damage core. also use core accelerator.particle wall is the best ability imho. lets you control engagements and lines of sight. slaved warheads are better than clutser missiles imho. you will connect more rockets and deal more damage in total. I use it with fast autoloader. your pilot loadout should include the LMG with slammer arc grenades the charge rifle and cloak. look for flanks so you can take some shots at unaware enemy titans. with that said dont be afraid to retreat once youve dealt some damage and  titans start firing at you. no need to go on a suicide mission.always pay attention to the map. look where your teammates are going which parts of the map are free where the enemy could flank from. no need to look down the same line of sight  of your teammates are already looking at.,titanfall,ciom2o2,2,t5_2xh0g

Its apparent that you havent played around with them much.  They feel a little different if youre used to lobbing grenades but rest assured it is NOT hard to get kills with them.  Gen s often get shit for using them because of how cheap they can be once you master them.One important thing to note  Satchels inherit your momentum.  So if youre standing still or backing away from an opponent and attempt to toss one you have a good chance of blowing yourself up as it is not going to travel very far.

I found these very helpful with orienting myself and finding good firing and observation points.  I still use those maps on occasion.The current DLC still doesnt have any really good maps.

1754161,0,t3_2ek7v0,I also had a thought the other night that it might be kind of cool in T if there were battles that played out in the big production ships in orbit. Maybe a bit meta but what about a game mode where two separate games are interconnected for lack of a better term. I mean youre playing CTF on the ground and you call in a titan but dont necessarily just get one because a hardpoint game is connected up on the ship and players there need to secure the points in order for the machines to produce the titans and drop them for the team below. For balance the guys up in the production ship could tag things like an enemy ship attacking them and guys on the ground could hack cannons that would take out the tagged ships up in space. This would help ensure that the players in both games are incentivised to help the other out. Would be even better if you could have a party of  where six are in each of the connected matches.I guess one could take it a step further and make it one big match where you could hop in a pod from space and plunge to the surface or get in one of the jets in the photo and fly up to the ship if you want to help out up there.For that matter you could run around in space shooting at other pilots in zero gravity with the jets acting as titans of sorts in that theater.Okay that turned out way more elaborate than I had intended. hahaha,titanfall,ck09q7r,36,t5_2xh0g

1881018,0,t1_ckfrdfm,gt It isnt the updates that are causing the lag problems it is the extremely low player population. Thats the first time Ive ever heard anyone suggest fewer players read reduced server load is the cause of lag. No. Theres a lot of shit going on but that aint it.High ping players may warp but they dont cause you lag. You lag because a virtual servers b terrible lag compensation and c probably some jacked origin crap? a and b for sure though.The Australians play west because their region is dead and its here or Asia. People outside west also play there because the games lag compensation is terrible. The higher you ping the smoother it is. Im west too I ping ms there and I flat out do anything to not play there anymore its so terrible. Central and East are exponentially better for me. However even when I pick Central and play with a buddy East well more often than not get dumped west... which just bites. Thats the result of low players.,titanfall,ckfut8r,0,t5_2xh0g

Dead Space ? Sims? Sims? FIFA? Madden? Titanfall?When every offering on your plate is basically a shit sandwich it is not too hard to shine in todays market but I dont remember the last time I bought a game that was complete often times being butchered for Day  DLC or plagued by unrealistic deadlines or lawsuits.

2010278,0,t1_ckvfitv,Im not trying to defend your isp... they may very well be shit... however theres a huge difference between youtube and a multiplayer game.Yes throttling would have an effect on your youtube experience because youtube streams a relatively large amount of data at you. I think the buffer is either MB or MB forget. A game packet though is only a few kbs. It doesnt come close to the size of even the intro to a youtube video.Even assuming your isp is shit they cant break the laws of physics. The speed of the internet is the same no matter how much bandwidth you have. You can think of bandwidth like a highway. A MBs connection is akin to a  lane highway and a MBs connection is akin to a  lane highway. The  lane highway allows more traffic to pass good for youtube than the  lane highway but each car packet is still subject to the speed limit.So with gaming packets are  kbs.

It takes less than a second to change guns a little longer for carbines sniper rifles and LMGs but you get to parkour faster and see more because youre not hampered by the bulk of your gun. More situational awareness and speed in exchange for an extra . second time to kill.

2447385,0,t3_2klo81,Hello ArgonomicI have played Titanfall since it came out back in March this year and  i really do love this game. i think you guys did a great job designing and creating this game. I also like the new ranked play IDEA. The idea of ranked is great most other games have it and it gives you a chance to show off your skill in the game. However I dont entirely like the way it was designed. At the early levels Bronze Sliver Gold i had zero problems with ranking up. Once i got to Platinum though things started getting harder logically. obviously as you go up in ranks it should get harder to rank up. Bu it has come to my attention that it had become insanely difficult. i am currently Platinum  with  battlemarks completed. I was playing tonight and ranked from Platinum  to  over the course of an hour or two. My last two matches i wrecked havoc. None of the other players even compared to me. yet i lost both of my battlemarks before the game ended even after scoring two mega kills and then in the match results i even damaged a battlemark. the next game i once again beat everyone on my team and the enemy team and once again lost both my battlemarks before the end of the game. Neither one of these games did i rank up to get my Diamond Tier . i dont know the whole workings of the ranked system so if you could please fill me in that would be great. i would like to know how i didnt gain a single battlemark in both games and in all honestly i think this needs to be fixed. i have a few images of my last game unfortunately i wasnt able to get images of the other game that i described above. I hope that you will take this into consideration and hopefully change something about this. Beta ends in  days and i would like to see ranked play continued but something needs to change about this. I know im not the only one having these problems for i have seen others post about this as well and many people dont like the way the ranked play is structured. Thank you for you time.

I feel shame.Hey everybody thats really good at Titanfall! You arent a competitor because the Software house that put together your game got into some legal trouble when they split off of Infinity Ward and they still managed to enter one of the most unique and dynamic FPS experience into a sea of AAA titles and they just arent as popular or have a storied past as Defense of The Ancients  League of Legends  Counter Strike  and Starcraft .Because Titanfall  and Respawn  is relatively unknown you are all fucking scrubs at Titanfall you are no good and if there was a competitive scene you would be as bad as YeahRightBs.,titanfall,cmwtae3,1,t5_2xh0g

2625251,0,t3_2klo81,I think the ranked play is highly flawed.  It seems to adopt the default position that if anything untoward happens it must be the players fault and they should get penalised.  Real life examples below all on Attrition on Xbox One with ranking around the Gold IV to Gold V markExample played more than  of a game with the scoreline in the s. Had one Rank mark. Suddenly the whole game freezes with a loud buzzing sound coming from the Xbox which happens a fair amount with Titanfall I must say.  Only solution is to go to the dashboard and reenter Titanfall from there.  After waiting an age for the game to load up again I go to review the last game stats to find that far from achieving an extra rank I have been deducted a rank mark for quitting early!  Wtf?!  Like its my fault the game freezes!Example Played entire game and achieved  rank marks. Game completes as far as score screen before losing connection to server again not uncommon. Sigh.  Load Titanfall again and check last score to find the game I had played in its entirety had not even been recorded.  I didnt lose a rank this time but I sure as hell wasnt awarded the two ranks I had gained fair and square.  Funnily enough though the burn cards I used up in that game did disappear. Kick a man while hes down why dont you.Example having a really good game and achieved  rank marks the highest I have ever done while in Gold.  I then get killed and respawn at the opposite end of the map to where all the action is. Spend the final moments of the game desperately trying to find someone to shoot while each rank disappears from my score like water through a sieve.  End the game without a single rank mark because the game had spawned me so far away from the action I needed a passport to get back.  How is that my fault?Example Played a four game streak. In two I was the highest scorer and in the other two I was the second highest.  Yet over the four games I lost  rank marks!  How dumb is that?  How can you lose a rank while being the highest or even second highest scorer?  How is it your fault the opposition isnt good enough?During a match ranked play appears to be so arbitrary that its virtually impossible to determine how any course of action will improve it.  A player is totally at the mercy of how the game judges the players around him.  And it forces the player to adopt a run and gun style irrespective of the conditions.  On a couple  and only a couple  of maps I like to snipe.  Yet due to the way the ranking works this is almost guaranteed to result in a rank penalty. I wont get as many kills as when I run and gun but I also wont die as much either if even at all so my entire score helps my team.  Its also fun to mix it up a bit.  Yet for the ranking I may as well stand there and be cannon fodder.  Itll penalise me just the same even though Ill show a degree of skill in my kills.The ranking system is poorly thought out IMO.  Too much is beyond the control of the player and the designers dont seem to grasp the concept that players resent being penalised for things which have nothing to do with them.  Why punish a player for quitting early for example especially when the matchmaking software is so suspect that it constantly kicks players off the server.  Or for the fact that the opposition isnt deemed worthy enough?  Thats punishing the player for your own poor programming.,titanfall,cn1991w,2,t5_2xh0g

3091503,0,t1_coi9aey,Dont worry you wont see me posting a scoreboard because there is no point to it... Like you say pub players sacrifice themselves alot for flags its not hard to kill them. If you have  kills in a CTF match that just means people are rushing for the flag not caring about dying. It means you where in a match where the other team is playing beyond stupid is it really that impressive? And a high kill total in CTF doesnt represent a good game if you still lose. It is kinda funny how so many people feel attacked when you dont care about their scoreboard. I will add I never said it doesnt require skill or that it was a bad game. I just said in my opinion a high kill number isnt nessecearly a best game because it usually has more to do with the other team being bad. But I know most of you guys dont care about what I really said.If he had  kills  caps and won the game it would have been a far better game imo. The  kills and still loosing just means he was too focused on one role.And yes Im obviously jelly and very bad at the game you know me so well.,titanfall,coiflf1,1,t5_2xh0g

3240577,0,t3_2x61vr,It comes from a lot of people that just havent played the game. People play the games the play because they are fun and because they want others to play it as well. People do not openly accept something different from what they do. Its human nature people like to stick with the same thing. I will admit that I did the exact same thing coming from the CoD series moving into other shooters making assumptions about games Ive never even tried out. Im glad Im past that obviously and the reality is that I expect it from people coming from the same background. Dont talk trash about a game youve never tried out before because looks and assumptions are most of the time just that and accepting and appreciating each game for its differences is what matters. If you people complain about how different a certain game is from their favorite just go back to your favorite game because you are completely missing the point of these games. I do believe that most people will move past this sort of mindset namely younger players and just try not to let it bother you. We love our game and others will just be missing out.

3386311,0,t1_cpe5lbw,I think a lot of people take quite a lot of pride in regenerating and having a high rank but personally Ive faced lots of tenth generation pilots in this game and tenthlevel prestige in Modern Warfare  and  and while achieving that rank requires a certain amount of skill I really dont think it proves anything. I think the ranking system mostly just provides a mechanic to prevent the game from stagnating for some players. Some people get bored once they reach level fifty and complete a bunch of challenges and stop earning rewards for certain things so having the option to start all over again and gain a new level of rank keeps the game interesting for them. Thats my outlook on the ranking system. I dont recommend regenerating unless you really love grinding for experience and challenges or unless you really care about making an impression on other players. ,titanfall,cpe9lh7,4,t5_2xh0g

3500901,0,t1_cprbk0p,Well yes the Ogre is no Stryder but that doesnt automatically disqualify it as a bad titan. You just dont play an Ogre the same way and same loadout as a Stryder. Just like an Atlas players differently than Stryder.I do however hate using the Ogre much like is implied by your comment.Turtleneckchain just is really bad at LTS and aparently positioning as shown in this video. A Stryder with  dashes can dance around an ogre all day. No questions here. Turtleneckchain played this v wrong and made the ogre look bad. I mean no matter what chassis a railgun at close range is really difficult especially against a big shield Ogre. Yet the Stryder won. As an Ogre youre supposed to find a spot on the map that gives you enough cover so your  dash is only used as a finishing move or maybe a last ditch escape. He should have let the stryder come to him and forced him to get within punch range or at least inside the building. A stryder dashing around inside is close quarters is just comical it completely negates his advantage.Not to mention Stryder had slaved warheads Ogre had Cluster Missle. Cluster missle will eat that stryder in close quarters if he makes one mistake. Again Turtleneckchain just had no idea how to play with his weapon loadout and thats why I called him out early in this thread.

3600332,0,t3_31ko75,Ive played quite a few pugs in this format and everyone should be willing to try it out.It shifts the playstyle from static rooftop camping to a much more offensive style of play. Map coverage is weakened so players have to constantly shift positions to react to the flow of the game. Its faster and much more intense.Indivdual kills carry much greater weight ordinance spam is reduced leading to a much higher cap ratio. Games between fairly evenly matched teams using the current format lead to nothing but a constant stalemate. Matches become extended battles of LTS which either end in a score of  or go to sudden death.This is both boring to play and boring to watch.The limited Titans shifts the strategy of their use. Titans become short lived force multipliers that are used to give a team brief control of parts of the map. Simple coordination allows a team of Pilots to wipe out any titan quickly.This is a video of the format in action and was one of the best PUGs Ive ever played.In short I see no reason why we cant have different comps that use different formats.,titanfall,cq2nwpy,5,t5_2xh0g

3756130,0,t1_cqkcec2,I think your misassumption is on how titans are effectively played.Basically in  everyone drops their titan as soon as they get it in addition most titans will be dropped within a minute after the first not giving much advantage to the one dropping first. After begins LTS meaning every titan is spreading out in key positions on their half of the map. Assuming one team is significantly better at titan play they will roll over the other in full force leaving them in titan control for several minutes...Assuming they are of about equal skill they will keep trying to take shots from distance or go for hit amp run attacks to deal little bits of damage the problem is this phase because it can go on almost indefinitely. Because each player knows the first one to push up too far will be torn to pieces by the other team. A tiebreaker  leaving them at an at least temporary advantage giving them the freedom to play more aggressively ussually ending the LTS phase one way or the other. The issue is the sooner the first titan drops the sooner the LTS phase begins assuming one team is leading at this point they have no incentive not to drag the LTS phase out.Now this can happen in  as well however here someone getting a lot of kills may have their titan significantly earlier than the other team likewise depending on performance or current situation people wont or cant drop their titans around the same time leading to more situations with  or  titans at a time instead of  or . Improving the overall flow and still keeping both pilots and titans constantly engaged.Another problem I have with  is that unless one team significantly outslays the other the ones to get their second titans first possibly the only few are usually the people that lost their titans first essentially rewarding them for losing the early fight.About more participants As someone relatively new to the competitive scene myself about  months now Id be extremely happy to see more people participating actually but we cant base rules around possible newcomers especially given very little growth of the comp. scene before the inception of the  titan or  ruleset.Sorry btw you caught me in a talkative mood ,titanfall,cqkfcx3,2,t5_2xh0g

Your titan sees the threat just in time and grabs you and puts you in the cockpit bay taking the blast and shielding you from damage...Turns out titans are smarter than we thought they were.

You have been trying to build a comms device out of the parts of the other dead titans.Eventually you get a signal. People are coming to save you! They find you unshaven malnourished and speaking gibberish to a weird kaleidoscopic titan.They want to decommission the titan because it is in a state of massive decay. You beg and plead for them not to do it but they say there is nothing you can do. You infiltrate the facility where the titans are being built and dismantled. You use your pilot skills to make your way to the chamber where your titan is being held. He recognizes you when he sees you and as you save him he makes a bro fist. You bro fist him back.You get in your titan and valiantly fight your way out of the facility. Humanity is fucked you scream. This titan saved you he has feelings he considers you his friend too. You are ethereally bound to each other.You succeed in escaping the facility in your decrepit titan.

3943915,0,t3_35lkha,While I agree with you that pubstompingnoobstomping is poor taste I disagree with you that an individual player shouldnt play public lobbies.I just reached Platinum level and I have always played in public games with the rare occurrence that Ive played on teams.  Ive always relied on matchmaking to put me where Ill be a challenge for others and where others will be a challenge for me.Match making is not perfect by far.  Ive been stuck in lobbies with unmatched teams for round after round.Where I agree with you is that teams of highly skilled players shouldnt pubstompnoobstomp in public lobbies.  Too often I see teams of  friends whore highly skilled just totally creaming other teams round after round.  It gets frustrating and makes me leave the lobbies in search of a more fair match.  You can tell when the opposing teams players dont change and they win match after match.Sometimes those highly skilled players have even created new player names and dont regen. past gen.  level .  The only drawback of that vs. being a higher gen. is the lack of available burn cards.  So they may deceivingly seem like new players.All the inconsiderate people in this thread who dont sympathize with this issue... read it again.  Try and understand the frustration one feels about pubstomping.  Its not an issue with a player not being skilled enough.  Even I get pubstomped.  Its an issue with match making and players taking advantage of the lack of proper match making.   If youre a highly skilled player with a bunch of other highly skilled friends consider playing in teams of  or  rather than  while playing public lobbies.  That way you get  or  random public players to allow match making to attempt to balance the match.  ,titanfall,cr5u907,1,t5_2xh0g

The diference here is the skill OP shows when throwing a frag while runingjumping and the people throwing frags into the air praying for a kill and getting it after all if I didnt hit him with the first frag there is not problem I can just throw another  and my friend another  and etc...

In my case I replaced the Sprint button with the Jump key.If I mess up my hops and start running immediately which is much better than messing up my hops starting to walk moving my finger to the sprint key etc then all I need to do is find a wall to jump on and start all over again. The same applies for when I need to stop and aim reach the flag room or come to a point in the map that Im not capable of bunny hopping throughrequires me to run through it.Having the process repeatedly streamlined for me saves me a lot of time that keeps on adding up and the value of that time is multiplied while stim is in use. It pays to be running in those moments and it hurts me just as much if I spend even a second of that time walking when I could be running all because I have another button to be mindful of.For most players the value of this added up time still probably adds up to nothing much but for those of us that are constantly running flags for the duration of the match it really can make a difference.,titanfall,csphy2n,1,t5_2xh0g

5235751,0,t3_3mpsg6,I have gotten into Destiny recently and the Taken King has made it a really fun game to play. I had similar thoughts playing the beta last year in regards to it being repetitive FPS being plain bad and the PVP sucking.Ill say this. The PVP still sucks. If I didnt have to do it to get various exotic weapons unlocked I wouldnt bother. Its possibly the worst competitive multi FPS Ive ever played.So based on that what is there really for Titanfall to learn? Titanfall is an actual fun multiplayer FPS. Its not relying on psychological tricks to compel you to come back. I can play for a few hours and have a shit ton of fun. What more do I want out of the game?With Destiny you kind of feel the need to log in and do your dailyweekly activities. Or finish a quest before the reset so you dont have to wait another week to get whatever trinket youre going for. Its all pretty fun as well especially with TTK having much better bossencounter design. But its also kind of dependent on its lord of the ringsstar wars style mythos. Space wizards and alien gods and whatnot. I dont know if I want any of that shit in my Titanfall. Grinding out legendary and exotic gear just doesnt fit in the kind of universe they established in Titanfall . Look at how elite weapons worked out in CODAW.I dont think they should focus on that sort of thing at all. A kickass campaign? Sure. A more elaborate Frontier Defense with more challenge and progression? Absolutely. Biggerbetter v PVP? Youre darn tootin. But lootgrind space fantasy?

Thats the existing bug I was referencing.Your bug is something you introduced with a marco and then fixed within that very same thing. I thought you found a way to prevent the actual core bug. I damn near got gitty.EditPersonally Ive always speculated that when the core bug happens it is because it sends off the activation sequence in the netcode before saving the value of core ready then it has to wait for the core activation animation to finish. Once the invisible animation finishes you can then activate your core since the value of core ready never changed due to the timing of it all. Only a theory though.,titanfall,cys3mn3,3,t5_2xh0g

6699716,0,t1_d0ax1vr,Im being serious with you unlike the other dork in this subconvo.I dont think the group of  with this gun wrecks all is a very valid usage of dictating balance vs. imbalance going forward in our current online FPS world if you want development and innovation to occur instead of sticking with CODX or HaloX guns with bullets and explosions as their only means of expressing themselves.  If games are going to in the long run provide deeper play both through in game mechanics but also through weaponsequipment guns and all weapons are going to eventually differentiate or be moreless effective on scales regarding duplication of weapons. The arc cannon certainly has attributes that synergize well with eachother not every gun has to have attributes where when combined with bunches some sort of benefit occurs.Of course a weapon that chains into others and messes up vision is going to synergize well with a group of  because then those secondary effects will be constantly running.  But what about preferring an Ext. Mags mm when going against a  v.  or  because in an ideal situation if you connect on your shots you have the best chance of beating  or more titans at one time. Im not saying  arc cannons isnt a nightmare to go against but holding that against a weapon is not going to further the pioneering innovation of weapons if each gun is equal to eachother  v.   v.   v.   v  and so on.  Blaming the group of  is also blaming the smart party that is teamed up and playing with class strategy.   TTs are going to give another team trouble if they are also playing with proper TT strategy.  Or  Accelerators. I am giving you that an Arc Cannon team of  is going to synergize well but I am not going to hold that against the weapon since thats just another trait of it.I think another illusion that gets lost in the shuffle is the similarities to titan weapons with pilot weapons and therefore all FPSesque player weapons.I think there is some sort of illusion that its not proper or goes against convention of FPS that maybe the Arc Cannon is indeed meant to be the intermediate player all purpose weapon of the game much like the r but just not dressed the same way.  Maybe unlike traditional FPS where automatic rifles are always the best overall they wanted to have the more intermediate level gun yet unique weapon be the best overall as a way to show they arent going to be thinking inside the box for this franchise going forward.  Maybe it was to teach these st gen TF players to expect the unexpected with future weaponry.  If weve learned anything about Respawn yet its that they are very good with easing you into learning basics and giving you easy accessibility to practice within the course of an actual game seamlessly to eventually master it.  Wallrunning parkour Titans etc. Remember titans are new.  So maybe this illusion that the mm or the Chaingun is supposed to be the main or easy gun of the game is just people lacking the ability to adapt to what Respawn is trying to develop here.   Maybe the fact that the arc cannon a unique weapon to the FPS world is awesome once you get the hang of it is precisely because it IS the new baseline weapon and they want it to be unique yet also relevant in this Titanfall universe.  No one truly complains that the R is the obvious winner of team of  with this gun rex all because its built that way.  Longest effective range of an automatic weapon yet comparable damage good clip good attachments yet its not a problem. It was nerfed once but perhaps since this gun is more unique if RS found a problem with it themselves maybe they opted to keep it as is on purpose.  Maybe the Arc Cannon is an example of them wanting to set the tone of what the new all purpose titan weapon should be and what to expect in the future.  It is a gun with a learning curve comparable to other ones so maybe it was always destined to gradually increase in use  over time.  And not every Titan weapon was meant to be tier  just because they are titans doesnt mean that niche weapons honestly deserve to not be pwned by the Arc Cannon.  mms can battle Arc Cannons and maybe thats all it was meant to be tier  against.,titanfall,d0cb4ca,1,t5_2xh0g

So many times Ive had a weak titan that has full shields but I end up getting doomed instantly by just  arc grenades. Its stupid. Frags are absolutely useless against Titans and good against pilots but arc grenades are arguably just as good as frag grenades against pilots and are devastating against titans.Just make them a flashbang effect against pilots and strip the shields against titans but do  hull damage and theyd be better.

6919904,0,t3_4aemno,gt I have mbps up and mbps down with a ping of about  to eastern servers and yet i still dont get full bars... why is that?Because youre not playing on the East US servers.  Just because you have a region selected doesnt mean youll end up playing on only that set of servers.  Been that way for a looooooooooooooooong time.  Just a few months into the games release my friends and I would have North Central US selected and routinely end up on South Central US probably due to playing with our friend from TX.   bar connections instead of  bar.  As the population continued to dwindle wed regularly end up playing on West US servers with  bar connections.  I really liked using the mm over the arc cannon even earlier on when not everyone had realized how insane the arc cannon was but it was too frustrating when youd nail a crucial crit in a titan fight just to have it not count at all because you were on a  bar connection.,titanfall,d10p0q7,1,t5_2xh0g

7844575,0,t3_4mp3u3,See I always got the impression that the reason Titanfall did not retain a large player bases was because it was marketed to the COD crowd. And when the COD crowd realised it wasnt easy and didnt have super tons to unlock they left.Titanfall is more like CSGO than COD or Battlefield. My worry for Titanfall  is they are going to try and make it more Battlefield and it will lose its core focus and gameplay or dumb it down further and make it COD. They should treat it like CSGO add customisation and skins maybe a couple of new weapons. Maybe a few new Titans but keep most of the core gameplay the same. Then when it marketed never mention COD start calling it UTCSGO with Titans.As for movement if you start splitting the movement abilities into loadouts rather than add to the existing selection of moves your basically forcing people into less flexible plays.This is exactly why I stopped playing Overwatch at the Beta. I learnt one chracters moves and how to use them and won almost every engagement without really trying. I dont want that in Titanfall . I want people to do unexpected things and engage in interesting ways which I can then learn and put a twist on. You cant do that if you give folk one style of play.

It played nothing like a normal Titanfall pub its worlds different with everyone bunnyhopping around with flags airstrafing and stim ejecting every two seconds. It makes the game so much faster and way more fun.Bunnyhopping is not an easy motion to master especially on consoles.

7964090,0,t1_d4b51pz, Theyve said that the weapons core and abilities are all locked in. There are  passives which are changeable. There was nothing indicating you can add attachments to the gun. For example there were no boxes there for attachments or anything however there was for pilots. The Holo Pilot has a different getup to the Tele Pilot as in different mask and armor. The ability also doesnt work like that it leaves a clone at your exact location that does the exact thing you were doing when you press it.

8662756,0,t3_4ygupk,Even though it does feel dumbed down the few hours I had were pretty fun. My complaints mainly have to do with the lack of bots and the way they removed the titan timer. My first match of amped hardpoint was extremely quick. I didnt even get to see a single titan which surprised me. I also dont particularly like how customisable titans were. TF had the charm of making the titan feel like its yours by having you change the weapon ability and ordnance. It made every titan on the battlefield feel unique in some way. Now that the titans are stuck with the same abilities and same weapons there is now no excitement of not knowing what the enemy titan will do next. All in all I believe that the communities complaints can easily be fixed by Respawn. Hell this is just a tech test after all...,titanfall,d6ogni5,28,t5_2xh0g

8664692,0,t3_4ykbpq,This is all from the first day of early access I will update on Monday after the Tech test.This will be a huge wall of text so beware.PILOTSGeneralI dont think that the movement was decreased or that it plays slower you have to utilise the new tactical abilitys more to have a higher momentum.Bunny hopping still exist that is good.Overall not much has changed.Melee is still one hit but it should be. We are super soldiers  robots after all.I like the idea of the boosts they can ben used versatile and I am eager to see what kind of boosts you guys got for us.BUT... I hate that the Titan build up time is now ONLY WITH KILLS. I wasnt that kind of good player when I first started Titanfall on the PC when it was released but I was still able to get an Titan and have some fun with it. Now in Titanfall  if you are not good at the game you only get kicked in the ass. I usually get  Titans per game but I played with a friend who didnt played any shooter on console for years and he didnt enjoyed it. This has to change. Titanfall was so special because even below average players were able to achieve something!Power UpsYou also get them with kills.Amped WeaponsYour weapons do more damage. Nuff said. It is fine.TickYou know why it is named Tick? Cuz it ticks and then it explode. Small spider soldier that looks for enemies and then explode. Its nice but I dont see a big appeal.Tactical AbilitysOverall I love them only thing I hope is that in the final game we can choose if we want to use an human or an spectre body.Pulse BladeI like it. It got good range and it is awesome to throw near an bank in bounty hunter to scan for enemies.What I dont like about it is that enemies get an message that they got sonared is this even a word? and even get the location of the blade on their visuals.Grapple HookAh... the hook. I love it because you get so much of a momentum with it and you can easily reach higher places with it also you can confuse your enemies. My favorite move was when I was running and got shot at and I shot the grapple to an tower landed behind the enemy and snapped his neck.But now the thing I hate about it. You can rodeo so easily with it that you can also combo it to destroy an enemy titan way too fast I wont explain here how to do it. I dont like it do it once or twice is okay but it is not cool to be able to destroy an enemy titan with one ability.Holo PilotIt is... okay. You can distract the player a little bit with it but they usually notice that it is an Holo and dont even bother with it. Maybe do it so that the Holo is also distracting the radar of the enemy?StimAh the good old Stim. It is fine it gives you a nice movement boost and the heal is awesome again saved my ass so often. Maybe increase the speed bost by a second or two.CloakI didnt had enough credits to buy this one here yet. On my second review after the next tech test I will be able to give feedback to it too.PRIMARY WEAPONSI wont say something about the small upgrades they are mostly the same.Assault RifleR CarbineI like it. It is good on medium to longer range not that strong in close quarters. The recoil is easy to manage and you can kill good with it.Submachine GunCARIt is like in Titanfall . You can kill with it in close quarters very good on medium range it is a little bit harder to hit but still manageable.AlternatorLike with the Cloak ability I did not had enough credits to test it out yet. Next week.Light Machine GunSpitfireIt is okay. You can shoot with it you can kill with it. This is one of the weapons that I think are not to use against Pilots but to destroy Titans. In Titanfall  it had the purpose to melt Titans with rodeo but this got denied in Titanfall  due to the new rodeo mechanic. If you want to destroy the whole world use Amped Weapons with this gun.LSTARI think that this is the Rifle to use against Pilots. BUT... the Laser bullet speed should be higher it is too hard to hit something with it yet in my opinion.Sniper RifleKraberLead the target pull the trigger watch your enemy explode. Kraber is like in Titanfall  it is fine and the gore machine. You just have to think about the bullet travel time. I still like it.D Double TakeThis gun is something. When I first used it I didnt liked it but later on this weapons becomes a killing machine. It is not an insta kill besides on headshots and it got a small bullet travel time aswell but with Amped Weapons it is totally worth it. I also love to put the Ricochet upgrade on it special upgrade only to snipers bullets bounce off of surfaces. Its fine.ShotgunMastiffDont got enough credits yet but this is the weapon I want to test out. I will definetly have something to tell you about this after the tech test.GrenadierEPGDont got enough credits but I want to use it. I hope it is devasting with the Gravity Star.SECONDARY WEAPONSYou have to decie on using an Pistol or AntiTitan weapon now cant decide yet if I like it or not.PistolRE AutoYou know the G from CoD or Battlefield yes? Here it is in Titanfall. For everyone who dont know it full auto pistol that will shred enemies in close quarters. It is good.AntiTitanLG ThunderboltYou shoot a ball of ligthing that electrifies enemies in range and does more damage when you directly hit something with it. Yeah sound neato but in comparison to the other AntiTitan weapons it lacks something maybe speed up the travel time?Charge RifleThe best sniper in the game! No seriously. It melts Titans when you hit the critical spots and it insta gib pilots when you hit them. Its fine leave it like that.Mag LauncherIts nice I like the burst mode of it and it good to use against Titans while jumping around.GRENADESThey are on cooldown now well... I liked it the other way around with having a set amount way more.Frag GrenadeYou can cook it it will explode. Nothing special the usual grenade. Leave it like that.Arc GrenadeIt stuns and blinds Pilots and Titans it does some damage. If you dont know which one to take take this one. Leave it like that.Electric Smoke GrenadeYour usual smoke grenade but with a twist. After a second the whole smoke is electified and enemys or you standing in there are taking damage including titans. I love it.Gravity StarEnemies are getting pulled in and it explodes after  or so seconds. It is nice when you can pull it off and the enemies are in there and you shoot them but I think it is too hard to pull it off maybe increase the range of the pull in?KIT Those are your Perks.Power CellYour Tactical Abilty has a faster cooldown you can combine it with every ability. Its fine.Fast RegenYour Health Regeneration begins faster in theory it is awesome. But practical you are often dead when someone shoots at you then this wont help you that much anyway.Phase EmbarkYou get in your titan faster. Sounds lame but it is too good. Being faster in your titan means you can kill the enemies with it way more easier and faster. My go to Kit  perk.KIT Your second Perk.Kill ReportYou see the enemy death locations on your HUD. I guess it got an function but I wasnt able to figure out what.WallhangYou can hang onto a wall while wallrunning it was an mechanic in Titanfall  now it is an perk. I use it because it is something that I knew from Titanfall .HoverWhen you aim while airborn you hover! Sounds awesome! Unlocks at Level  or with  Credits and right now you can only get to Level  this weekend. I will report back with it next weekend.TITANSGenralTitans are harder to get now you have to kill or play the objective to earn your Titan. I dont like it. Look above for my explanation. Please bring back the timer.Also you cant do much about rodeos. You get at about  Core build time an one use of Electric Smoke. Okay but I would love to have one Electric Smoke when you first get your Titan and then get another one at abot  or . It is not cool to get your titan and have it immedieately destroyed because of grapple hooks look above. Please Respawn.Also maybe make the critical hit zone smaller or only make it so that you only got an critical hit zone when your Titan Core got stealed via rodeo and then you can disable the critical hit zones when you get another core into your Titan.TITAN KITYour Perk for every Titan the same.Assault ChipYour AutoTitan want to kill more. It is nice when you are not in your Titan. Leave it like that.Turbo EngineIf you are mostly in your Titan use this one. Extra Dashes means more surviability. I like it.OvercoreYour Titan starts with amp Core Build Time you can use it but I think the other ones are way more worth it.Titanfall KitYep you can now even customize the Titanfall!BubbleshieldYour Titan is protected when you call it in call in time is  seconds. It is just like you knew it from Titanfall  I like it the most.WarpfallYour Titan warps into battle call in time is  seconds. Your Titan is there faster but it is not protected anymore. I dont know Bubbleshield is way more worth it.IONHe is strong. Splitter Rifle is devasting against Pilots as it is against Titans. Maybe it is too strong. His abilitys are all neato. My opinion so far is to reduce the damage he can kill an Titan with one magazine.SCORCHYou want to see the world burn? This is Scorch he can make your dreams come true. He is okay you have to combo his ability to make him shine. His Trap is okay but you have to shoot it. Then it is devasting. It is nice to use against Pilots and AI but I think that Scorch lack some good direct damage against Titans. But this is okay he is more of an Crowd Controller.Thanks for the read!,titanfall,d6ope32,1,t5_2xh0g

8674255,0,t3_4yraym,Some of my issues with TF Titan Build Times. They were fine in the old game theres barely ever any titans out and about and Im yet to see more than  deployed at a time. Absolutely no reason to change the build times imo.  Lack of AI takes away from the game. TF felt like you were really in a battle there were enemies and friendlies all over the place now youre stuck running on the ground all over the place looking for people. Feels like CoD and I dont like CoD  Maps. The maps dont seem as pilot friendly. Maps on TF were designed great for wall running and jumping around as a pilot. TF maps simply dont have as many ways to jump and wallrun around the map taking away from the core gameplay. Titans. Aside from barely ever getting them they feel like shit. Id rather just play as a pilot all game tbh. I LOVED playing as a pilot in TF but that would never stop me from calling my titan in as soon as I got it.  The Core Gameplay. The core gameplay in TF was damn near perfect imo. The wallrunning shooting movement titans everything. Sure TF lacked depth customization and a good campaign but when you were in a match playing it was a masterpeice. TF feels like a masterpeice of shit in comparison imo. It feels clunky and slow. I guess you could include anything I already listed in this one too. If it aint broke dont fix it. Titanfall  wasnt broken and they tried to fix it. All they needed to do was add more. New maps new guns new tactical abilities new titans ect. Even though the game is prealpha as of right now it feels like they took steps backwards. I could probably go on but Ill just stop here p ,titanfall,d6pwkaa,1,t5_2xh0g

8679154,0,t1_d6qi52x,Yea I get that feeling. For me its the feel of speed doing parkour in titan fall . However I hope that people will also slowly come around to the current tfalthough it still needs a bit of adjustment since its so much fun when everyone works together especially if everyones strangers.Im seeing that as people are playing longer players are becoming more coordinated. Atm Im seeing that even in solo games people are coordinating batteries somewhat. I remember at the start of the game how people would just run around with batteries on their back even when there were damaged team titans but now people are actively looking for titans to put batteries on. A lot of players are also realizing how important keeping your teammates titans alive are they help a lot with killing ai and titan objectives. Its really difficult to  v  compared to tf so if you want to keep your titan you better keep your teammates titans alive too. I hope that this trend continues. There is still a lot respawn need to change before the game is perfect though.,titanfall,d6qinpv,5,t5_2xh0g

8686495,0,t3_4yxsxd,I try not to speak on behalf of a group of people and their opinion but I believe most of the people that had discrepancies with the timer were referring to Amped Hardpoint. People were not getting titans until the last few moments of the match. I think the patch paired with people getting the systems of the game have decreased the time it takes to get on now but the point people were trying to make was that titans before had always been on a timer so no matter what type of person was playing they would get to play with a titan too. Locking it behind a killstreak seems to be a very counterproductive thing to do to people who just want to play as a titan in a game called Titanfall. ,titanfall,d6rft2k,2,t5_2xh0g

8695341,0,t1_d6sejme,gt Long time players usually hate any change no matter whThats completely false.  The long time players demanded that EA get rid of the smart pistol instead of learning to play against it.  Which apparently EA did.  They whined about the satchel charge being too powerful apparently that didnt make it to T as well.  Which is sad because TF had a lot of appeal to kids you could hear them on the mikes having a blast which will no longer be able to compete with other players in the game without the smart pistol.      EA should have never listened to the long term advanced players.  They should have test marketed the game with people who have never played the game and made it appealing to a broad market.

8718249,0,t1_d6utgdf,Many players are wondering why we changed the mobility from Titanfall . We identified two major issues we wanted to solve in Titanfall . The first is that a lack of player predictability would often cause players to be shot from the back or sides. While flanking is an important part of gameplay death often felt random instead of skillful.First I completely agree with this statement the last few months that I spent on titanfall  were like this a lot of the time in terms of pilot vs pilot battles.  The thing is thats what the Titans are there for.  I think whenever you have mobility like this predictability is lowered but the Titans bring players out to fight and it becomes a tactical d movement mech fight.  Hopefully the movement is perfect this time but I understand what you guys are aiming for.Also any chance the match timesscore caps would be increased for longer matches?  It felt like a lot of games were ending too early in the tech test.,titanfall,d6vf5kd,1,t5_2xh0g

8732132,0,t1_d6x4vud,It seems you and I arent on the same page just yet.I do agree the gunplay is more refined and much needed but even the designersnot devs admitted to building maps of pior quality and did alot to slow the game down.What made Titanfall  in my opinion one of the best shooters of this decade is the insanely high skill cap of movement pilot combat titan combat and the maps.As it stands right this second. The maps are of poor quality comparatively the movement has been dumbed down and intentionally restricted and the titans have been nerfed so hard that they no longer play the same. Their also advertising game modes in the tt that go against everything tf was about. PvP only cAmped hardpoint and a poormans attrition.I havent judged the game yet because I trust respawn to still do the gamemodes right. CtF MfD amp LtS. Im also super stoked about the campaign.But ive also found that I enjoy the tech test much more when Im not compairing it to the og titanfall.Did they do things right? Yes. But they also changed alot when they didnt really need to. Time will tell.As for the halo analogy think of it like this. Fans did not get a game they thought they were getting with reach. As of right now thats the feelings of  percent of this subreddit.Edit elixar you amp I have have very similar understandings opinions and apparently game history and I would hope that you can take a Step back amp look at it from a neutral angle.

The new acceleration while wall running and jumping is better but not quite right. Needs tuning for sure. The verticality in the map is still lacking and it still promotes longdistance engagementcamping. The titans are still sluggish and the reduced boost time is barely noticeable.

8741628,0,t1_d6yci59,Ah a kindred spirit.  The TTK is a tricky puzzle because on a math level its actually very similar to T.  Its other factors that are messing with it.  To name a few... Maps.  Strange as it may sound its a HUGE factor.  I noticed this when cod started falling to hell mw and beyond.  Smaller maps tighter quarters mean a larger target.  Less bullets miss.  Secondly guns do max damage at close range.  T seems to average much closer combat than T and thus you fall faster. Amped weapons Netcode.  Purely theoretical but if its more responsive and you are dying closer to when you are supposed to rather than slightly delayed due to weaker code then it will feel much faster.  That is of course due to the illusion of living longer even though the game has already decided you died it just takes longer for it to tell you. Additional mechanics.  If they change something like lets say CAR smg havent used myself so I could be wrong but if they made its hipfire improved that is an extra factor that makes it an improved killing machine beyond RPM and damage per bullet.,titanfall,d6yct1o,2,t5_2xh0g

8747879,0,t3_4zu0wh,Unless something changes drastically between now and release I will not be buying it.I was taking it pretty much for granted that Titanfall  would be a dayone purchase but the tech test has shown me that the changes theyve made have removed virtually everything I enjoyed about the first game.I liked the chaos the speed the handling of the titans the atmosphere the parkour and the map design.Now? The chaos is gone entirely the titans are no fun to pilot the atmosphere is bland parkouring is almost a quixotic choice particularly during a firefight and the maps are both uninspired and do little to encourage parkour while at the same time creating vast areas where pilots are easy targets.The only thing Im ambivalent on is the speed aspect. With the freerunning being neutered through both mechanics and map design I feel like the game lost something truly essential to its nature but the addition of the grappling hook almost makes up for it. Almost. Instead the grappling hook is restricted to a single class and leaves me wondering what could have been  if theyd kept the freedom of movement from the first game and added the hook on top of that. It boggles the mind to think that they passed on that.All this of course is simply a matter of taste and there were both other aspects of the game that other people certainly enjoyed that remain in the game as well as new elements that have been added that other people have found make up for whats been removed but the core of what made the first game so enjoyable for me is gone and the chances of me purchasing the sequel are right now approaching zero.,titanfall,d6z5171,10,t5_2xh0g

8750075,0,t3_4zx08q,Because it gives more variety.In the first game you could outfit your titan how you wanted yes but the only difference between titans was healthspeed.By making more titans with specific roles it makes each of them feel unique each has their own hook each has their own counter and each has their own feel.It also makes them visually identifiable at a glance you can see one from across the map and be like Oh thats a Ronin I shouldnt let it get close. Its the same reason they attach a character model to each tactical ability but while I feel that shouldnt be the case for pilotsknowing what tactical ability a pilot has doesnt really have a bearing on how you shoot them I think its a good thing for Titans.Having unique titans makes things more interesting in the end.Also while you are right that other class based games have customization they all have things exclusive to their classes like the Engineer in battlefield always having a repair tool to themselves. Then there are also class based games with no customization Overwatch for example.,titanfall,d6zeyjn,1,t5_2xh0g

8767483,0,t1_d71a456,I really dont envy the position theyve been put in.They have a game with a small but vocal fanbase who loved the original game but an original game that was quickly abandoned by many in favor of other shooters. Now theyre making a sequel that has to surpass the original in sales and do this by a making a game that fans of the original will enjoy and b bringing back those who gave it up. And because that wasnt difficult enough theyre doing this all while c releasing in the same season as their strongest competitors. Thanks EA.Weve seen the results of these sometimescompeting motivating factors in the Tech Test and while the response among fans of the first has been largely negative the fact that new players have been enjoying themselves doesnt mean those decisions were entirely wrong. As vocal as this community is its simply not big enough to carry sales of Titanfall . Respawn has to make the game more appealing to outsiders if its going to sell enough copies to justify more games in the series and part of that means making changes the veterans may not like. Its a necessary compromise. At the same time alienating your most loyal fans isnt a good move either. There has to be a balance and with the needs of each group sometimes conflicting its not easy to find.It seems Respawn has been leaning toward appealing more to the outsiders than the veterans from the Tech Test but hopefully theyre able to find a middle ground that everyone can enjoy and soon release is just  months out.

8799749,1,t1_d75lbuy,Which may be fine for casual play but at high skill levels stats and math matter. You may like to do it one way but as with any game there are objectively better and worse strategies. In the current LTS meta everyone takes Vortex Shield. Why? Because smoke is useless in TitanTitan fights if the players have any degree of skill and sense. But imagine if you could design a Titan for whom smoke is a benefit in LTS. Obviously you cant just make smoke so good no one can refuse to take it youve got to balance it. So you give smoke to a Titan who also has a grapple and root ability. Now you can force an opponent to stay in your AOE damage field!But you have to constantly adjust kit to make sure the game stays in balance. In a fully customizable build game that means you balance competitive play around the metagame. Everyone runs flavor of the month builds and homogenizes play style at least at the highest skill levels scrubs do what scrubs will because if youre bad playing against bad build doesnt matter as much. But if you have the hero model like Overwatch then you can balance the whole game around the whole game. It actually encourages diversity of play style because you dont have to worry about some FOTM meta build becoming so good everyone runs it SOS Ritualist in GW anyone?. ,titanfall,d75lyyd,5,t5_2xh0g

8808113,0,t1_d76lkkl,Noted. To counter your point I agree that Titans are super easy to rodeo. Which is why I think this idea provides a modest balance between the new and old system of rodeoing. In essence rather than killing a titan outright by being able to shoot up its internals this only weakens the titan significantly without actually damaging it. Such an opportunity allows for teamwork as a person is not able to take it down solo as youd need your teammates to actually do something. A well timed hack can turn the tide of a titan v titan battle but a poorly timed one would have a negligible impact.,titanfall,d76m5oy,2,t5_2xh0g

8889268,0,t1_d7g1tyx, What argument?  Literally your argument has been something something latency and lag.Something something if someone doesnt think its OP THEY must use it.  Youre speaking out of your ass and sound salty.  Heres a list of guns that were much better at one point or the other while I played. The Kraber in the hands of a great player could annihilate people. The R became almost godly to me. You could literally kill three pilots with it in one magazine and empty that mag in no time. Literally it was a bullet hose. Then I could go and down a Titan with full health in no time.  The EV was OP for the longest time because the range and spread could drop people as quickly as it took to get your crosshairs on target. It was easy to use and was almost mandatory for CQC.  The CAR had good range and killing power with superb accuracy without sacrificing parkour game. Easy to control and killed quickly.  The R could kill in almost all situations and was balanced for almost everything.  They all could kill a single pilot faster then the smart pistol ever could without giving up versatility.  THAT is what makes them better. Literally your argument comes down to  The gun aims its self! Its OP! I dont like it! There is a skill cap on the weapon. After a certain point you CANNOT kill any faster with it like the better guns. You cannot take on multiple pilots without there being a real skill gap issue with them.  I have little idea why you cant break locks or have problems killing pilots that use the SP. Its not this godly weapon youre making it out to be.     ,titanfall,d7gd4d0,2,t5_2xh0g

This is just another example of that.EDIT Also to address your original question regardless of Ions primary weapon if Im not mistaken the heat shield blocks Ions laser shot also.

But I cant so I wont be gambling  bucks. As others have said it is on Respawn and EA to enable the game to succeed. I think the release window will play a large role in that. As consumers we can give constructive criticism to Respawn and give accurate reviews. I think it was a mistep for Respawn to remove TF from EA early access I hope they dont hold review copies until release day as well. Some alternatives to your idea would be to buy those friends copies of TF and see if they like that and if so they or you can buy them TF. Respaen should reinstate EA early access it shows confidence in their game. They could also include a number of codes with each copy that you could gift to friends that would let them play the game for  hours. I expect they wouldnt be valid immediately after release as like all titles EARespawn is sounting on some impulse sales.

9331585,0,t1_d8yk18p,I AGREE on most stuff except for Immersion. Scifi has the ability of really bring flexible in tech because we have no idea how fast our tech jumps. In  years we went from computers and Internet being a luxury to them being almost standard in the average household. A supercomputer then is my  laptop.Another thing is with BT and being sentient. It was already established in R with spyglass that AI are sentient. AI are commonly used in titans but BT is the most advanced titan ever.Camos on your titans are nothing new. In WWII pilots would decorate the planes with a variety of things. From naked ladies to the infamous shark design. Traditional camos are useless to ft tall machines that come in like a drop pod. Might as well decorate it to your preferences as to stand out. Also pilots are pretty recognizable on the battlefield. From their unique helmets to their loud as hell jump jets. Unless it is specifically a stealth mission then the military doctrine of being uniform would have been thrown out years ago for Pilots.,titanfall,d8yuhgc,3,t5_2xh0g

The wallrunnning in Mirrors Edge  feels structurally the same as Titanfall although glitchier and sloppier and less smooth. The angle and feeling is like Titanfall.Theres a distinction between ultimate origins and influence. I think Mirrors Edge was the one that got into developers heads regardless of prior art.

9439710,0,t3_59zii1,In TF the Spitfire was only good against Titans because of the way rodeoing worked instead of the batterygrenade chucking system in TF you would rip open a cover and shoot the wiring with your Primary or secondary You could use AT weapons as well but only the Charge rifle was really viable for that . The Spitfire did a ton of damage when used this way and had an attachment that further increased the damage it did to Titans. With that you could kill a Titan in seconds very easily sometimes before they could disembark and shoot you off. It was my go to for LTS back then.,titanfall,d9cjsxi,1,t5_2xh0g

9444689,0,t3_5a2do6, Tone looks like she can be OP for sure. Luckily many people on the consoles suck with her.  The weakest seems like Northstar. The easiest seems like Legion.  Ronin is fun but sometimes his attacks get delayed for me. I dont think hes so competitive because his shotgun takes so damn long to reload and arc blade doesnt do a lot of damage for how long it takes to activate.  Also the whole execution sometimes doesnt work and it gets annoying smashing melee three times before it clicks.  He also has the weakest core. I think they need to rework it. The damage is pretty weak considering he has to get close and becomes vulnerable.  ,titanfall,d9d6jer,1,t5_2xh0g

9448121,0,t1_d9dknc6,Yes the suggestion above was that if multiqueue was added people should be able to pick what modes they want to queue for.

Scorch do ot have dashes by default and his speed is too low to go out of the nuke.

A layperson looks at it and sees  version and  deluxe version.In the PS store the Deluxe version of BF is the same price as the Deluxe cosmetics version of Titanfall. That is at a minimum VERY bad marketing when the intent is to provide a better value. You can downvote all you want but the the reality is sales numbers. The deluxe version of anything makes it sound like the regular version is missing something... there is zero chance that doesnt undo much of the noDLC cost intent.

If TF is anything to go by they probably will do some huge discount some time next year like selling it at  or .

9477128,0,t3_59xj82,I absolutely loved the Campaign it was short but didnt overstay its welcome. It added lore that was desperate to the Titanfall universe and added CHARACTER to the Titans with subtle hints and characters from the first game lookin at you Barker. But overall the team took full advantage of Titanfalls unique mechanics. When I thought of the campaign I couldnt help but worry there would be too much gunning and waiting behind cover from the inevitable bulletstorm or too much Titan gameplay that would get stale and repetitive. But no! We had unique levels that had plenty of running jumping platforming gunning Pilot throwing and Titan badassery all wrapped up in a nice cohesive package spanning across ten missions. I think Effect and Cause as well as The Beacon are my favorite levels because of their length and how damn FUN they are! BT is best Titan. ,titanfall,d9h9dsb,1,t5_2xh0g

9488520,0,t1_d9i617v,I see BF and to a lesser degree Siege as a different kind of game than Titanfall.  Theyre slower games though even Titanfall isnt THAT fast compared to games like Quakeworld which probably had the deepest TDM mode ever implemented and Tribes and tend to be focused on different things.  My favorite recent FPS game right now is probably Reflex though its in early access but I wouldnt really say its better than the Battlefield games because its apples and oranges.  I havent played Overwatch much I bought it but only really played the beta but even it is somewhat different being a Team Fortress  style class based game.  Depth is hard to judge as its not the same as complexity.  The simplest game can be incredibly deep if its simple systems and rules interest below the surface level in a way that makes them easy to learn but hard to master.  I also dont think depth requires teamplay as dueling in the Quake games had no teamplay but a lot of depth.I dont fault Titanfall  for not being Battlefield or Rainbow  anymore than I would fault Battlefield for not being Quake or Counterstrike for not being Tribes.  I might prefer what one is doing over the other and I might like one better which is usually what people mean when they say something is the best in years...that they like it and enjoyed it more than other things and trying to refute that is futile I think.,titanfall,d9invr2,1,t5_2xh0g

9504286,0,t3_5az9zo,My encounters with ronin usually go like this dash to close range sword energy wave thing dump  rounds with the shotgun smoke screen phase dash through the titan to reload because you can reload in phase dash rinse repeat until somebodys dead. I like nuke a lot more then then extra dash personally. Depending on the location of the encounter you might be able to trap them and get a free kill if the area is tight enough. I almost never use the sword block. Im sure its good for something but dodging just seems way more efficient and if youre out somewhere that you cant duck behind cover youre playing ronin wrong. Dont use the melee except to execute. It has longer reacharea then a normal titan melee but does the same damage. The sword core is trash because you cant execute during it.

9510682,0,t1_d9lahxx,Hello pilot welcome to the frontier !It can be a rough place to learn but stick with it you WILL get a lot better.   T was my first FPS shooter and like you I was completely at a loss for a while.   hours later I was wrecking and Im consistently getting  pilot kills  titan kills in attrition in T sans map hack Heres what Id recommend for pilot play in attrition or bounty hunt. Stick with the R or a SMG car or r for now.   unlock the HCOG when you get a chance.   use extended ammo.   STIM is life.   for now focus on mobility and positioning.. Your goal is to maximize situational awareness and obtaining the best position to maximize your chance for wining an engagement.   There a lot of factors to this but youre main focus should be on obtaining high ground.  Try and consider cover having an escape route and know where you are likely to be flanked from.   When you initially spawn from the match have an idea where you can find a good initial location preferably that has some grunts nearby.  pop stim and get there as fast as you can.     Wait for a bit and observe if you see a pilot shoot them if you see some grunts shoot them.   If a pilot gets the jump on you pop stim and either run away or try an shoot them.   In either case once youve won an engagement or  its time to move.. pop stim and get to the new place as soon as possible.   rinse and repeat.  To me this gets you in the rhythm of things and keeps you from camping.  Yes camping a rooftop or window will work ok against inexperienced player but I guarantee if someone shoots me from a roof Im going to respawn  flank them and have my revenge.   In the end I think theres really  main playstylesstrategies that work well.  One is to hold a good position for a few kills relocate killing any pilots on the way and then repeating.  The other more advanced is run and gun which is simply just constantly parkouring around the map killing everything.  Its an amazing improvised dance of death !!,titanfall,d9le6bl,2,t5_2xh0g

9523130,0,t1_d9mshxa,This definitely goes both ways. I dont even want to think about how many games Ive had where the top scorer on the team only has that much because they think playing the objective means that they should only be running to the drop zone farming money and running to the bank. Meanwhile the enemy team has an endless Titan advantage and are overall slaughtering us because people dont realize how important it is to kill Titans and to my frustration will actively avoid enemy Titans thinking they need to stay alive and get the money. On the other hand Ive tried a strategy lately where I mostly focus on killing enemies and it works amazingly. Obviously I try to bank any money I get from it as soon as possible and I actually am almost always top  on the team anyway but just the fact that you are harassing the enemy team while your teammates are farming the drop zone and bounties can easily be enough to win the game. Ive had quite a few matches where even though I was towards the bottom of the scoreboard it was very obvious that my constant picking off of enemies was more than enough to keep the enemy team from making any real progress. Last because it is obvious from my time ingame that many people dont understand this I want to throw something out there If the enemy team has any Titans at all you should probably be focusing solely on killing thatthose Titans. Attacking Titans is by far the fastest way to get your Titan and the longer the enemy Titans are ignored the longer they have to kill everything in their path win the game with ease and just make life hell for your team in general. This goes for pretty much any game mode too. Nothing is more frustrating than being the only person trying to take down their fleet of Titans while the pilots on my team are just playing the objective thinking that they are helping when they are really just allowing the enemy team to win the match with hardly any effort. Alright thats the end of my rant. ,titanfall,d9mxeox,3,t5_2xh0g

Yes a good Ronin doesnt need a metric ton of dashes but if he is going to be TiFs hit and run titan he really needs to have the dashes to get in AND out.

9529177,0,t1_d9nl2jt,I feel like its all about positioning and not barreling into other titans. Legion Ion and Scorchs cores can all be trumped with cover. Northstars core is of course vulnerable and the rockets travel slow enough that you can outrun them. Ronin has to be in melee range. Which leaves Tones core as the hardest to deal with. When Im out numbered in Titanfall  I always make sure to retreat repositionand reengage from another angle. Yeah titans go down faster but I feel like thats the point. It punishes charging recklessly. One Northstar can last a good part of the match if played carefully enough. I feel like most TF players are trying to play their titans like its TF.,titanfall,d9no7ec,1,t5_2xh0g

9530740,0,t3_5bed46,If youre on PC the optimization is good. The only potential issues you may have are due to system specs but as long as you meet recommended baselines its smooth as butter. I think network problems may be specific to certain areas. Im on a major eastern seaboard server so I cant really say for sure but Ive had exactly one network issue since release and it only required a restart. Its a brandnew game. Titans are specialized and weapon and tactical abilities are static with modifiers applied to any given Titan. The selection of Pilot tacticals is also a lot better but its still a selection of  or so. Everything Ive said so far only applies to MP. SP is a fully developed albeit short story campaign. My general advice to people is not to buy TiF if you only want the singleplayer but you have to play the singleplayer if you do its really good. ,titanfall,d9nv4dq,1,t5_2xh0g

9548095,0,t1_d9pywn1,The Battery Boost immediately attaches a battery to your back. If you are already carrying one Battery and activate your boost you will drop one battery. Does calling in the Battery Boost give you a green glowing butt like when you pick up a regular battery? Not sure. But again you should not activate this until your own Titan is ready or you have a friendly Titan in front of you to give it to.You cannot activate this when you are in your Titan you have to activate it before or get out activate it then come back in. Usually I wait until I have my Titan ready to activate the boost because if you die with your boost battery activated you will drop it and lose it. You can use the Battery boost on a friendly Titan. Giving the Battery to a Titan will grant you  Titan meter. So if you activate your battery boost pop the battery into a friendly Titan you will immediately get your Titan.  to get Battery   giving the battery to friendly Titan  Your Titan is ready.I dont think you can activate it when you are already on a friendly Titan.

9586270,0,t3_5c7s43,I think everyones primary and justified gripe is Scorchs primary weapon is extremely underwhelming.  It NEEDS to have a two or three shot magazine instead of the single shot it has.  His flame shield is monstrous his fire wall is beautiful area denial and while his accelerant canisters take some skill and practice to use properly they are amazing when implemented to potential.  But his main weapon is at best meh.Having the single shot means it cannot be used strategically.  You cant fire a shot then fire a second shot where the enemy is dodging.  You can get an enemy to dodge into your accelerant then light it with a second round.Ronins shotgun is a better primary at this point if only because it is ridiculously effective against pilots.If Scorch had three rounds per reload Id main him.  As is he is way too niche.,titanfall,d9upc38,8,t5_2xh0g

9589597,0,t3_5cb2br,I definitely dont have the time put in to counter or agree with any of your points but heres how I play Ion.Extra dash grand cannon.The laser shot is my primary weapon not the splitter rifle. I only use the splitter rifle to get some DPS out there while my laser shot recharges. And I never use the zoomed in version because it drains energy and therefore prevents more laser shots. I only use vortex shield as a panic button to get behind cover. Other than that I never use it. I never ever use the tripwire mines. They use energy I could be putting into my laser shot. Ive actually had some really good success with the grand cannon perk. Ive taken out Titans and then put DPS into other Titans. I play Ion as a catmouse Titan. I pop out laser shot then pop back in to cover. I attempt to flank like you would with a ronin. Now that I type this out I guess I do see some of your points. The fact that the most successful I have been is to never use one part of the kit trip mine and rarely use another vortex shield says a lot. ,titanfall,d9v43sc,1,t5_2xh0g

9619556,0,t3_5covho,Hemlock is fineit is unlocked early so people have a chance to practice.  If you find it OP wait until you meet someone who is good at the G or DMR.  By the time the G or DMR are unlocked people have faves and they stick to them.From a very practical point of view it makes more sense to nerf  titan than to buff  and might set other gameplay out of balance even more.  I feel Northstar may need a defensive buff if anything.  Not having a method to mitigate any damage is almost unfair considering all the other Titans have some method.  Northstars flight core is useless essentially rendering her a huge target to everyone on the mapmaybe damage reduction or the equivalent of Ronins sword block while active.  Or in the highrisk highreward of Northstars play style swap Flight Core with Salvo Core.I think almost everyone agrees Tone needs to be looked at.  The Titans are much more balanced in Last Titan Standing.  But still a team is at a disadvantage without a Tone and a Legion.  The problem is Tone has no real weaknesses. The only Titan I have found to be a good counter to Tone is Ronin.  His Phase Dash can allow him to avoid the Salvo Core.  Once in point blank the particle wall is severely neutered.  The biggest issue with Tone is she is too good at killing pilots.  Tone is TF| equivalent of an AtlasArc CannonParticle Wallfunny enough the only effective counter to an ArcCannon in a public match was a very aggressively played Altasmm i.e. a Tone,titanfall,d9yt3sn,1,t5_2xh0g

If you really hate the nuclear ejection on titanfall  than you probably would have lost your mind playing the first one. Fun times.,titanfall,da0zho0,1,t5_2xh0g

9653083,0,t3_5d9oz9,Wall of text crits you for over  damage. You die.I appreciate that you took the time but yikes you gotta separate stuff into some paragraphs! Like this    . first number point paragraph         this is a paragraph break underneath a number thing but with the same indent level  we achieve this by putting a space in front of it.        . second number point         etcHeres an example of what your post could look like showing just the middle because of character limits......The Discussion PartHaving read over your guys interpretations of the plot holes and plain makes no sense parts I have to disagree. The inclusion of the time travel dynamic was awe inspiring perfect and made sense. The fold weapon caused fluctuations in time and space but only due to the massive power surge when the test backfired and exploded. It is noted in game that the IMC was aware of the potential of the fold weapon but time travel diddnt really fit in there. The reason that time travel was possible was that . The accident had already occurred and ONLY ripped time in that location. It was a known occurrence and thus could be controlled and studied. BT barking orders and commands at NPCs. This I hadnt really thought of before but I think all of the AI and BT questions can be easily answered by BT. Its crucial to note that BT was no ordinary titan the Vanguard class titan was the first to be designed by the militia itself and was very rare as well as special. Its continuously noted that BT was highly desirable and special could net a high price if sold.  I think its fair to assume that his AI was far along enough he could be referred to as a commanding officer in certain situations and respected since BT is practically a supercomputer with limbs and guns. No other titan in the single player is referred to this way and we can guess that it does happen but to no one we see. BT will also tie into this next point... The SERE kit and the Smart Pistol. Now it is important to differentiate between single player and multi in this one. Well get to multi later. First the SERE kit is last resort. Like last resort. Like there is no other option whatsoever resort. And thats where the SP comes in. In my eyes we only see it in the SERE kit at the end of the line because of its techlevel. The SP is such a advanced and rare piece of technology in this game that it is reserved to be used in life or death situations for pilots. BT is no longer able to uphold the protocols so they hand the pilot such an incredibly overpowered weapon it insures their survial in the meantime.  I also believe that taking BTs AI core is what allows the SP to be used all of BTs AI is channeled into the SP which powers its aiming and tracking systems as to why Cooper is holding the SP in one hand and BTs core in the other during the mission. What other reason is there? At least my idea. The BTs specialness is also why it is a thing I dont see any of the other titan types with a SERE kit or removable AI core at all. Of course this discounts that TiF gave literally anyone a SP but when you dont have a single player mode where are your weapons gonna go?Multiplayer and BalanceOkay heres the nitty gritty. Look I love multiplayer and ive been playing long enough to see both sides of the balanced vs. op debates the Why does this exist debates and the shit vs not shit debates. I really think it falls somewhere in between the two. Is it fun as hell? Oh yes. Its amazing and im having an absolute blast. Is it Tif? Well... no. This game is a different experience not entirely but it is different. Some of the fundamental characteristics of the first game have been changed or removed completely. Titan shields have been changed and rely on batteries to be present rodeo system is now a closed animation loop and fluidity as well as momentum have taken a hit. This does not mean these are bad changes.. Titans  Look ive seen titans played at worst and best. I know all of them at least well enough to play comfortably. As for the current discussion is Tone OP? Yes but not as much as you think. You want a point of reference? I have fallen victim to dropping a titan climbing in and been destroyed by a salvo core before the titan screen was done orienting. Ive had it happen to me. But Tone is not the raging behemoth that everyone makes her out to be. I do agree that she is the best titan in the game and something need to be done though. To me start with the salvo core. Does as much if not more damage as Ions laser core does it in less time and is far easier to aim while regaining control of your titan. As much as I see it discussed its impossible to defend for long and is the main offender to Tones power. I also think that the tracking missiles and particle wall compliment each other well enough that the real counter to it is either block with your own ability just to be subject to it five seconds later or run away. Now dont fucking nerf her into the ground just dont. Start with one thing at a time and go from there. The real issue is that some of the other titans just have no real edge unless played by someone that can utilize their abilities  and outplay the other opponent every time.   Ronin and Northstar are the two that are the worst at this. Ronin needing to flank and close the gap between anyone before its three health bars are stolen away and Northstar being too busy getting shot at to do anything else. Ronin needs a bit of a core change unlimited dash plus the ability to execute without being immune to it. Done. Northstar scrap the whole kit and rethink what it means to be a sniper in this game. Her main issue is that most of her abilities including her core completely negate being a sniper. Flying to become a giant red bulls eye in the sky? Tether trap that fires and works at nearly point blank? She just needs a serious look. Besides that in all honesty the other titans are fine.   Scorch can be played very well and balanced. As a Ion main myself Ion is great. Ive gotten to the point of which I can counter everyone effectively besides other Ions. Now what sets Ion and the others apart from Tone is the ability to continuously output. Ion requires careful resource management to run your vortex laser shots and splitter effectively. Tone doesnt even need to reload her tracking missiles to fire them just three locks and heres another volley. I can be driving with the vortex up but Tone will fire a sonar and lock me anyway again. Really Ion is good you can use the vortex shield to absorb incoming damage even other core abilities but Tones is the only one that seems to blow through my shield with  missiles and then melt me with the other thousand that are behind those. I apologize for using this as a Tone rant but I feel thats where we are right now.. Pilots  Anything thats not an SMG is at a disadvantage for not being an SMG. Its really how it feels. A few of the rifles are survivable at this point but nothing can hipfire crossmap melt someone like a CAR can in this game. I feel this is a step back from the first game where hip firing wasnt reliable unless specifically addressed with the weapon CAR. This also ties into the TTK which is way lower now. Forget turning on your enemies when you get  degrees through a  and die. Okay thats an exaggeration but it does change the feel of battle when out maneuvering your opponent meant something rather than whomever lands the first shot wins  of the time. AGAIN THOUGH these are nitpicking observations. i still love this game to death but just have a bad habit of comparing everything to first one.   On that note. RESPAWN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY SATCHELS?? I was so exited to unlock them for the first time to find them slower clunkier less lethal im actually fine with this part and a pain to use correctly. I LOVED air bursting satchels in Tif and throwing them into windows and surprising enimies and doing crazy damage and and and. Breathes Okay Okay. theyre not terrible sure but I used them for a solid  games trying to get the feel of them but just. couldnt. do it. The time between throw and detonation is horrifyingly slow combined with the smaller kill radius mean I better hit the damn pilot in the face with it if I want to have a chance of killing them by the time I actually pull out the detonator and the explosion delay is over.   Rant Over. Alright. next thing. Melee. Was it kind of overpowered in the first game? Yep. Is it the complete opposite here? Yep. Look I get that the first game had some issues of course it was going to but I think Respawn took the wrong approach and practically flipped everything over to try and compensate. You dont need to add aim assist to my fists but goddamn let me much further than from nose distance away.... etc!,titanfall,da2xyfs,5,t5_2xh0g

9654157,0,t1_da2wf98,Honestly I would normally agree with you but in this very situation the target had very limited evasive options. He either had double jump left grappling hook phase levitate perk or he was going to drop into the sniper bullet. I think with those limited options that was a very well place bullet that had an immense chance of hitting. If the sniper aimed directly at the target and the target double jumped right at that moment to stop his fall that would have been massive luck. I also think that the fact that he was so quick to acquire his target so quickly post phase and mid fall was really impressive skill based actions too. ,titanfall,da32qga,1,t5_2xh0g

9658087,0,t1_da3h1t6,See I feel the exact opposite. I find that PC gamers have the ADD who jump ship any time ANY promising looking game comes out and once thats run dry they jump back to those games youve mentioned. I feel like those games are the exception rather than the rule. I found Battleborn to be an amazing game yet the playercount dropped as soon as Overwatch came out. Personally I found BB superior to OW in every way. Now we can sit here and debate about Overwatch vs Battleborn but thats not the point of this discussion. I think when we look at the population of Titanfall  on console vs PC well find that the console base lasted a lot longer than it did on PC. I think this is due to more alternatives in the PC market like Ive already said. I find that PC gamers tend to jump ship all the time but eventually just come back to whatever they were playing before.,titanfall,da3k7k1,2,t5_2xh0g

The movement is great so much better however theres less opportunities to wallrun without bunnyhopping i feel it could be possibly pushing new players to camping then getting bored and quitting. I do not enjoy chokepoint type maps i prefer maps like Angel City demeter runoff etc that have fights happening in all parts of the map not certain areas where everyone are huddled like in COD. However maps like Eden exoplanet and Drydock are passable.The game is great some of the game feels more bullshitty. i feel like titanfall is trying to have a different feel from the first which is good in a small dose.I like it but theres so much that feels wrong.,titanfall,da82683,3,t5_2xh0g

9699833,0,t3_5dzae9,Ronin definitely needs a buff. The amount of effort required to do well with him is extraordinary.  People here are writing paragraphs how to make him viable. They fail to realize objectively they could probably do more with less as an other Titan.  Every single other Titan can deal damage at range or indirectly reliably. They dont have to sit there and only pick battles that favor them just to be effective.  You arent committing to a match If you arent damaging enemies. As for Ronin  he lacks the burst and survivability to do his job well.  Ronins burst is about the same as a Northstars rail gun.  The difference being Northstar can let the shot off across a map and get back into cover before any retaliation.  Ronin has to get into range and THEN fire off shots. Then hes hampered by a long reload where his tiny health gets chewed up.   Why does a melee oriented Titan have such low health? One extra dash does not make up for it and his sprinting speed isnt that much faster.   Why can other Titans burst quicker or more efficiently?   Youre rewarded for firing at the front of a Titan because thats where the critical areas are. You get no extra damage for attacking head on. Thats counterintuitive.   He has the worse core in the game. Its counter productive and limits his range even further. Not to mention it can be negated by punching.   His giant sword does the same as the other Titans punch. I also believe its a bit slower with a bit more range.   You get damaged if you kill a Titan next to you. This hurts him ALOT.   Hes not the king of melee. Scorch is.  TLDR  The risk and reward doesnt pay off for him. Other Titans can do great damage while remaining safe. Id like to see his burst go up by a lot or his core regenerate HP.      ,titanfall,da8pm41,6,t5_2xh0g

Inf warfare is not doing so well  decrease in sales from last years Cod release arguably with the positive reviews from established critics as well as private individuals these players might gravitate towards tf OR bf Still good news for tf.In the case of the matchmaking system its not really something that I have noticed. Some games I get murdered constantly and in some games I do decently well. Having a matchmaking system might be detrimental given the current low number of players and could create a divide in waiting times between new and older players Not risking losing players due to waiting times. Until the player number starts to increase respawn could hypothetically wait to introduce matchmaking. You may be right there is probably not going to be a huge surge of players who are suddenly going to buy the game but it could happen that slowly over time the number will increase.

Its almost like it was made to be a last ditch effort to do some DPS when in a pinch except it doesnt even excel at that due to every other Titan being able to literally block the barrage and tank what makes it through.

Respawn made it so that if your health was that low no bleedthrough damage from pilots could go through to that health i.e. archer did same damage to shields just not health.

9841690,0,t1_daqe8jp,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,titanfall,daqe8kt,4,t5_2xh0g

Ion is my next highest.SubjectThe electrical effect is badly needed on the tether or two tethers should be the default.  Maybe a minor amount of electrical damage or just the sheer force of a titan yanking those off them like the magnet takes a bit of armor off.  Or blind them for a moment with an EMP effect.  Or prevents them from turning so much.  Or at the very very least has a smaller rooting so they get stuck on the spot with say half the movement area they have now.Or make it attach to and kill pilots.  Thatd be acceptable.Titan KitAssault chip is absolutely garbage.Stealth Auto Eject only hurts your team in LTS and well any playlist.  Your doom state no longer degrades you have no excuse to jump out that early just to try and hide.Turbo engine is honestly one of the two decent choices here.Overcore?  Her core is really sad pathetically so.  Skip.Nuclear Ejection?  Youre a sniper in the back.  Unless you get flanked by a Ronin which can easier get out of the blast radius youre wasting this perk.Counter Ready is my own personal choice as I can use one for defense and one for offense.Northstar KitPiercing shot isnt bad great for narrow halls but ultimately too situational for me.Enhanced Payload is my personal choice as it really helps punish those hiding behind shields and your only great defensive option to deter pursuers.Twin Traps should be default.  Skip.Viper Thrusters should be your normal flight speed the guy in campaign was crazy fast.Threat Optics are a joke.  Play with a team and communicate.Other thoughtsYoure a sitting duck anytime you hover or use flight core.  Id honestly prefer a temp defense boost or flares to divert incoming rockets when you hover instead of higher movement speed.  That or a straight damage increase.A fully charged shot from my sniper should be able to drop a Tone or Legion Shield.   Two shots if theyre Reinforced Particle Wall or Bulwark.  Im willing to negotiate  and  fully charged shots respectively.That Ion laser is practically if not a hit scan.  Feeling like the Plasma Railgun needs to be hit scan or needs to be at least a rd faster in projectile speed.And lastly if I put in a fully charged shot into a Titan that has a sliver of health so small you could do it with a spitball the rest of the guns damage NEEDS to translate into the doomed state.The Core ability is trash beyond belief.  Give me  rapid fire instant charged shots for the Plasma Railgun instead.  Or let me lock my missiles onto targets.  Or more damage less flight time.  Or actually fly higher up so I dont get punched out of the sky.Idea fly super high  seconds to fire  instant max charge shots and a defensive boost while Im up there so I dont get every gun on the enemy team melting me on my way up.  Or flares to deter rockets at the least.,titanfall,dasz20k,0,t5_2xh0g

9907148,0,t1_daysgj8,Tone beats Ion in damage per second sure which is why a smart Ion will use its superior burst damage from cover to come out on top also Im pretty sure Five Way Splitter might out DPS Tone that thing is a melter. Northstar is the goddamned KING of burst damage and can tear Tone up while peeking from cover. Scorch doesnt need direct line of sight it can launch a can and then firewall to box Tone in allowing it to push forward with the shield up. Legion... well Legion is the only Titan with a lower ceiling than Tone.The particle wall is the biggest damn drawback possible. Again it renders Tone stationary. Its only good if you just stand there taking damage while shooting it. Which a lot of people do because a lot of people are bad at the game. But again if you cant counter a stationary target you just arent very good.Tones not a bad Titan but its a low ceiling  floor titan. Easy to learn easy to master. The other Titans outside of Legion all have higher floors and ceilings.

9933828,0,t1_db1xy7f,gtI am snide and dismissive when the summation of the thread youve linked is just that. Psychological projection at bestA sophisticated way of saying no u and youre the one who wants to make the pot and kettle comparison. Alrighty.gtSo where is the actual comparison? How does one determine that Tones weapon is far too strong?By looking at what the titan weapons can and cannot do under hypothetical and non hypothetical circumstances that assume the titans kill as many pilots as they can given the restrictions of said circumstances. gtIt seems that the conclusions are just accepted but I have yet to see any actual hard facts to support them.This is the equivalent of holding a  lb weight in one hand and a  lb weight in the other. You know the  lb weight is heavier but you dont know HOW much heavier. However you refuse to admit the heavier weight is in fact relatively heavier without a scale saying how do we KNOW its heavier without a scale we need numbers I mean I MYSELF cannot tell the difference.So with a shield of anecdotal evidence and opinions you say that nothing we say about Tone has any meaning whatsoever unless we dig into the game files hard code or a dev spoonfeeds us. So lets try to do what weve done a dozen times before and analyze what we DO know shall we? Northstar can get one shot kills with her primary. This generally requires lead time and wait time as the shot becomes more accurate over time. She has  shots. Her rate of fire is slower than Tone faster than scorch. She has great range but seemingly bullet drop. How much bullet drop if any she has as well as how accurate or not her weapon is are both debatable points. Scorch can one shot pilots with his singleshot primary requires leading targets even over a short distance is only really feasible in close range has a long reload time has some splash damage. Missing with scorch is penalized due to his very low rate of fire. Ronin can OHK pilots easily with his shot spreadfire gun and it fires very quickly. Its range is very short and Ronin has no long range options at all. Targets dont need to be led there doesnt seem to be any splash. Legion requires several shots to kill a pilot. He has a large ammo count and no splash damage with two firing modes. Switching modes takes a second as does readying the gun to fire. He can reliably kill pilots at range with his Long Range mode but requires having the mode engaged already and spooling up the gun hampering his reaction time. In Close Range mode the bullets spray and he may not get a kill unless he has a chance to aim at a pilot for more than a second or two. His rate of fire is very high but reaction time is very low.  Ion has two pilot killing options Laser shot and split rifle since her primary is inefficient at getting pilot kills we can assume it isnt honest to compare that to the other primaries since it is likely used the least to get pilot kills in an Ion. Ions abilities all run on one resource. Laser shot can be shot twice to OHK pilots before no energy is left. It is hitscan and has a moderate rate of fire hard to say exactly but on par with NStars primary and is good at very long range. The splitter rifle consumes energy quickly and can also kills pilots quickly but only at close to occasionally midrange. Consuming all energy to kill pilots leaves her without any defensive options. Laser shot has no splash and her splitter shots seem to have a tiny bit although it is difficult to say.So lets compare to Tone in this mental exercise since there is nothing better we can do short of having the hard numbers given to us. Tone has  shots in his primary  more than NStar. He shoots faster than NStar. His shots have splash and NStar does not. His range is on par with NStar for the purposes of long range on the maps. These alone make Tone obviously superior to killing pilots than NStar. The projectile speed comparison between the two is debatable as is how easy it is to aim with each of the titans but I make my case as it is. Tones fire rate is much much higher than Scorch. Scorch has a much slower projectile that drops considerably. It is difficult to sniper pilots out of the air with Scorch unless theyre close. Scorch has a single shot that slowly reloads while Tone can fire off  in quick succession. Tone can also fire and defend at the same time Scorch cannot. Erego it is easier and faster to kill pilots with Tone rather than Scorch probably the most obvious example and I love Scorch. Tone can fire his gun instantly with great range unlike Legion who requires spool up time. Tone has only one firing mode which is equally as efficient at killing pilots at any range provided sufficient aim. For Legion to reliably kill pilots he requires either his gun to be spinning which slows him down and makes him a target or an extra couple seconds to see and react to a pilot before tracking spinning up and shooting. Tone can fire and OHK the immediate instance she sees a pilot. Legion can potentially outkill Tone in certain situations but you could say the same for the rest of the Titans save for perhaps NStar. Legion has no splash. Tone has no resource to manage as Ion does. Tones offensive abilities and pilotkilling does not subtract from his ability to drop a shield or spot his targets with sonar. Tone does not require multiple hits with his primary unless he misses obviously for the sake of argument we assume all shots are hits for all these discussions Ion does. Again Ion can only laser shot twice the equivalent of  of Tones mm unless you wish the count the short flight time of those rounds before shes out of energy. Tone can OHK reliably at any range as opposed to Ronin. Tone has  shots Ronin has  reload is about the same time. Ronin can potentially kill several pilots in one shot but that situation is the exception to the rule. Ronin cannot attack and block at the same time and can only kill pilots at close range.Those are my comparisons and arguments. In each case every titan has a downside with their primary that hinders them in certain situations. All except for Tone. That is my main thesis Tones primary has no downsides and therefore is the best and easiest for killing pilots. If I am wrong WHY am I wrong? What are your counterarguments to this?gtYour opinions are fine I disagree with themFine but WHY? You need to explain why if you posit that I am wrong you cannot simply say you are wrong because anecdotal the end.gtI think that the penalty to missing a target on Tone Scorch and Northstar is severe.But we arent talking misses first of all. For reasons that should be obvious this argument requires assuming shots are hits the question is how DIFFICULT it is to land that hit. Secondly missing a shot is a penalty for everyone but again this doesnt factor into the argument. Everyone needs to aim.gtA single dodge or block of an individual mm round results in a  damage drop across the magazineA pilot doesnt dodge or block a mm round either the Tone pilots lands a OHK or he doesnt. If a surface is nearby he may get a kill due to splash. We are not talking titan v titan here lest you forgot. Are you a good player? Okay do you want a really high kill count? Okay. Then pick Tone. That isnt to say that other titans CANT get as many kills as Tone potentially but Tone is far easier to rack up a high kill count than say Ion or Scorch. Because again his primary has NO drawbacks.gtWhere you might say that Tones primary is the better of the three against Pilots I would agreeBut thats the whole point. That and Tones core are the two biggest problems everyone has with Tone. You said you went through the Tone threads how do you not know this? If you agree then why are we having this discussion? Does that make you part of the circle jerk?gthowever Id also say that the rest of Tones loadout doesnt necessarily facilitate killing pilots where as others do.And I would argue that no other Titan kits in the entirety of their parts allow them to surpass Tones entire kit in the task of killing pilots with an equal amount of effort put in.gtMy point being making direct comparisons in Titanfall  is a difficult thing to do since so much of the game is situational.The situation in this case is in general. Tone can kill more pilots more easily at range than NStar and closer up than Ronin. Even if you were talking a succession of various scenarios Tone can stand toe to toe if not exceed the abilities of the titans whose niches are served by such scenarios.Conclusion you typed a lot of words but didnt actually say anything. I made a conclusion you said you disagree with and then provided no counterargument. I have again reconstructed it above but your only response to the core of what Ive said in your previous post is this is all anecdotal therefore you are wrong without explaining where or why thats the case. Mathematical proofs are abstract concepts that exist only on paper does that make them not proofs? I have attempted to use logical comparisons to make my point. If I am wrong I need you to use logical deductive reasoning to explain where in my thinking I am incorrect.,titanfall,db2eitb,1,t5_2xh0g

9978105,0,t3_5idrdh,Nice video! As a long time player of Titanfall Ive had both games since release and even bought a Titanfall controller I feel like this video perfectly sums up my feelings towards the new iteration of the game particularly the map design. You did it fairly concisely too and justified your points of view. Subbed!As I said though Ive been playing these games since they first came out. I was in high school when the first game released and me and my friend spent so much time together on it just doing the cool shit only this game can allow. It was amazing. Now however were both poor students who both moved to different cities on near enough opposite sides of the country but we still play together as much as our courses allow us. Destiny had its hooks in us for ages but after  years of the same thing and with such a toxic community it was time to leave. It was difficult to find something worth my time afterwards though and I kept going back  until Titanfall  released and afforded me the opportunity to just have some pure unbridled fun. This game is awesome and while I was lucky enough to be able to afford it on release my friend wasnt. Ive already sunk a considerable amount of time into this game and I would love my friend to be able to join me soon. He intends to buy the game as soon as he can afford it but with Christmas around the corner he has spent most of his money on gifts for his family. Either way thank you for doing this giveaway  youre contributing massively to the very same community you praised in your video. This sort of thing will only help the game grow and Im pleased to see such a great community every time I come on this sub. Together we can make Titanfall as great as it deserves to be!,titanfall,db86b9t,1,t5_2xh0g

The game also is brighter when run in windowed mode ast least on my machine. I opened a thread because of this issue on the official EA support forum I managed to get a good picture by first lowering brightness ingame to the lowest setting and then decreasing contrast thereby lightening up the dark areas as well as increasing saturation a little bit both through ReShade.

10004706,0,t1_dbb700d,I think a momentum system could do well in that vein while being different enough from ticket systems.What I mean by this is the better your team is doing the more resources your faction contributes to the fight. If youre making progress on the mission then your brass will feel its safe to send in reserves to mop up. If it looks like youre losing then theyre not going to throw resources away into a losing fight.The way this works in practice is that the larger your lead the bigger and faster your minion waves will be. If youre blowing the other team out then easy points will get slimmer and youll have to hunt more. If youre getting blown out then you can shift to guerrilla warfare and ambush massive grunt spawns to catch up in points. If the score difference reaches a certain point then the dominating faction will jump the gun and attempt to land some sort of infrastructure to solidify their control over the area like a generator or a command shed or somesuch which will provide a large amount of points if the losing side can destroy it.,titanfall,dbbn4ew,9,t5_2xh0g

10005010,0,t1_dbbggl5,Legion spends most if not all his ammo on a shield. The mm cannon does pretty decent damage against Titans and dude you point at the pilot and they die. The drop is negligible. Ion drains her energy while using her shield leaving her less able to spam lasers. Ronin can instantly destroy the particle wall which is good but no other titan can really do that and hes flimsy. Tracking rockets hit most of the time and are difficult to miss if you use them at medium range or closer.Northstars primary cannot  shot the wall which makes it annoying to kill. Flight Core does less damage on average compared to other cores leaves her vulnerable and is harder to use because of how the rockets are fired.,titanfall,dbbojth,1,t5_2xh0g

10024807,0,t1_dbe8drw,Other tips I can give you Use and abuse phase shift. If you have good reactions you can get out of most sticky CQC situations.   Dont be afraid to try for the noscope. Especially if you are sitting in extreme close range. It is a gamble though. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. Figuring out the proper distance to try for it can lead to better results as inside of a certain range the shot randomness doesnt matter. Dont use anything other than the stock sights. The others defeat the biggest strong point of the gun. Excelent CQC combat ability for a oneshot headshot weapon. Learn map pathing and crosshair placement. Its a skilled that will carry you farther than anything else. Having your sights already pointed where you know someones head might appear makes everything easier. Faster ADS perk is required. I also prefer Speedloader as it allows me to reload inside of one phase shift. Fractal Ocean is the best camo.  Lastly stay mobile. ,titanfall,dbe9dmd,11,t5_2xh0g

Original or not zombies has a good replay factor to its addictive nature and not to mention if done correctly fun. If Titanfall  wanted to make somthing original or fun I think they would have introduced it along with campaign but I only propose zombies as I know the reality we live in they cant dedicate more time that they dont have..  I am sure they have a schedule planned for us in the future for new maps and guns along with Battlefront  releasing next year a zombies mode would be better suited and more possible for them.

10098212,0,t3_5kf6cq,I got bored with Overwatch the movement feels very basic and Im not saying that the game needs no skill but Titanfall feels like it has a higher skill ceiling.Once youve figured out the Overwatch heroes powers thats kind of it. Then you play the same maps with the same objectives over and over again and it gets boring really fast but in Titanfall I always feel like theres some room for improvement like I can try and get better witht favorite assault rifle or just alone the combination of different pilot loadouts with different titans already makes for more variety.I mean its all cool in Overwatch but every hero feels like part of a lesser game like Pharah is clearly Quake inspired but only the rocket jumping part of quake and D.Va I guess like mech games but only the mech part and Tracer is a little bit like Corvo but ONLY the blinking part.So in a way the game is as wide as a lake but as shallow as a puddle. I mean its cute and all but I prefer more intense action and Overwatch is a little bullet spongey a little circle around people shooting at them again and a little slow actually.I mean its Blizzard theyre not exactly particularly innovative they just know how to recombine different elements well thats why Overwatch is a facsimile of all first person shooters to date.,titanfall,dbnt7zf,5,t5_2xh0g

For my kit I use turbo engine and for my titan kit I use extended mags or if Im in super try hard mode against a really good Tone Ill use light weight alloys so I can mitigate Legions severe lack of mobility.

As a community of players we can be better than that and help new players to learn to play rather than driving them away.Just because something is seen as the norm doesnt mean we all have to be part of it.We all disagree that toxic behaviour is bad yeah? So when we see it directed at newer players we should say to those new players to ignore it were not all like that then offer them advice and help. We should say to those players being toxic that theyre going to kill off the game that we dont want them and they should change.Its basically bullying I was never alright with bullying at school if mates got bullied Id step up hell I did it at times when nobody was going to step up for me.

10115130,1,t3_5kqylt,You should always be on the ground and aiming down sights.  Dont bother trying to hip fire anything and just because you can run on the wall does not mean that you should.  Also use the cloak ability with the spitfire.. and as soon as you cloak you should quickly fire just so your team knows where you are at.  Never slide into a room that may have bad guys.  You should get good with the Mastiff.  Northstar is your Titan to use for noobs... if you get shot at you can just fly away.  Never use anti titan weapons because they are big robots and you are a tiny human... why piss them off if you dont have to.  When running away from a bad guy drop an AWall behind you to confuse and disorient the enemy.  For a good surprize attack throw a smoke grenade at your feet.  When facing off against Ion throw as much ordinance as you can at his shield to break it.  The Kraber is best used hip fire at close range.  Always use auto titan with nuclear eject.  Always Grapple hook Titans from the front especially Scorch and Ronin.  Try to always have a battery on you because it will make the other team think you are on their side.. because you will glow red and green not just red!  Pilot sentry guns are best approched from the front.. and shoot them..  Always try to melee Reapers.  When a Titan is badly damaged and stiffens up and a white light appears with a whirring noise run towards it because you can get its battery quickly.  Dont give Batteries to friendly titans just wait for your titan to drop.  Dont use Titan Dome shield and try to drop your titan right by a bunch of enemy titans.  The shotgun is like a sniper rifle stay on top of a building and try cross map  no scopes like a beast.  The flaming ninja star is great to throw into a windowdoor before you go in.  When using a titan kill grunts one by one with your gun dont try to run them over.  Big Titans like ScorchLegion never need that extra dash.. use stealth eject.  Ions tripwire is OP.  As Ronin try to phase dash inside another Titan for hilarious results.  As Scorch throw your canister trap things really close to you and hide in the smoke then use your flame shield if someone shoots at you.  Holo pilot is OP.  Phase Rewind is also OP.tldr these are best tips read them all,titanfall,dbq0cyp,-5,t5_2xh0g

Be like oh shit it doesnt work for this mode. So Ill have to completely change it up. Not every weapon is viable but it is playable. that weapon might not get as many kills or even win matches but it will force you to think how do I play effectively with this loadout. The weapon alternator is a very good example. Short range SMG with  rounds. It forces you to learn good mobility to close distance to the enemy quickly without dying. How to pick your fights since you have limited ammo with this weapon you can not get into an extended fire fight. To be honest these are basic game mechanics that you should try to get good at to become a better player. ,titanfall,dbsukh3,1,t5_2xh0g

10178887,0,t1_dbxss07,I dont agree there. Even if both teams can farm AI it is still a PvP mode. Attrition is in its core a game mode where your team and the enemy team tries to score as many points as possible how you do that is entirely up to you. Farming minions has always been the best way to score points and while the grunts and sprectres are seen in smaller groups nowadays the reapers at the end of the match make up for that imho. It is also super easy to stop an enemy farming your teams reapers as reapers alone are an easy target but they become very anoying if you are also fighting an enemy pilottitan. Would you call DOTA not a PvP game? Because it is even though you are fighting AI most of the time. ,titanfall,dbxu00b,1,t5_2xh0g

10180017,0,t3_5llscp,I think it would be cool if they added more of a tactical element to them.  For example maybe they take considerably more damage from the back or making it so that they can be mele killed easily.IMO these three things could be a fun alternative to simply lowering their spawn rate.. They take much more damage if hit from the back.. A weak point is added in their neck area this area gives no advantages to AT weapons but the normal weapons can do some damage here.. Pilots can instakill them with mele maybe remove a battery causing them to simply fall over before exploding.,titanfall,dbxylwk,1,t5_2xh0g

10191064,0,t1_dbz4fub,Its a trade off you have to decide. Your shots are always going to have a bit of travel time so its better to fire earlier if your worried that youll miss your shot because of a dash or cover. you also are at your most vulnerable when your charging up your rife so If you can line up a good shot for a crit area on a titan take it. Id rather do good damage build core and stay mobile rather then wait possibly miss and take a bunch of damage. When you are in a strong position where you arent at much risk then you should try to charge up fully but if your teammates are getting hammered on even just doing some minor damage to their opponents will help out. So you have to decide what is best for a given situation and with practice you get a feel for it.,titanfall,dbz7ph0,10,t5_2xh0g

10191950,0,t1_dbzay71,I think its good for the game to have an easy titan thats very simple and straightfoward to play its just unfortunate that its also currently somewhat overpowered. I dont think that the devs would make such a drastic change to something. I would like to see more skillbased elements put in on both sides of Tone. Slow the rockets down and raise their turning radius for easier dodging using a dash but give rockets more momentum when launched for better purposeful corner wrapping make locks lost faster when line of sight is lost perhaps tick by tick perhaps factor in time since hit higher make mm shots fly a little slower make the backup speed of Tone slightly lower make the shield curved more so you get better cover from the sides but have to be more stationary same total length of curve but sharper curve gives less width more depth make salvo core fire rockets slower still same total damage less DPS so that enemies have more time to get cover. A more drastic change that Id like to see would be for salvo core to make Tone immobile while it fires since it does so much damage with such high application compared to Northstar and Ions cores which have significantly worse application. Also reduced mag reduced firing rate increased damage for the mm to give the same DPS but make misses matter more especially once missile use rate is limited more by cooldown time than lock acquiring. This also helps with the antipilot power issues that Tone has. I also think that one of the big things that makes Tone hard to counter is that pilots have a hard time against the huge blast radius of the mm cannon even when taking cover especially due to sonar. Other titans get whittled down by pilots tone just feeds core off them. Reduced splash damage direct hits still kill would be nice to see. Also arc grenades removing locks that a Tone has would make for interesting team play but arc grenades are already quite powerful. ,titanfall,dbzbbcr,2,t5_2xh0g

10220976,0,t1_dc1ncmv,I hate the map but it has nothing to do with my performance. Id even wager its one of the maps I do best on because I know the how to abuse its weaknesses such as bad spawns and the  lane layout. Theres a lot I dislike about Crash Site. I find it utterly unbalanced.  One team gets a highground advantage and the other team gets to eat dicks. It also servery limits player choice and playstyles. If you spawn in the bottom position for example you can basically forget about grenadier weapons. If you spawn Top great! Pick up your favorite blaster and enjoy the free kills! Oh you died? Thats ok back up the hill you go! The two lane layout of the map also encourages gameplay that I personally find tedious. Most games either devolve into campfests or a choice between two meatgrinders with no good way of flanking. The main paths that you fight on are just plain uninteresting. Its hills and tunnels aka titan paths and theres very little verity in what pilots can do in these areas  you mostly have  or  extremely predictable spots from which you can advance otherwise your out in the open. I dont think its like the worst map ever created or anything. Its just the worst map current in TF|. I love the style of the map the jungle the hills  all that jazz is top notch. It looks fantastic and the fact that it can wall run smoothly on almost anything is really impressive. I could have been an amazing singleplayer map. ,titanfall,dc2lsb1,1,t5_2xh0g

A mobile playstyle will only give them your general area if you are moving erratically around the objective and not just setting up camp in a corner youll be fine.I still think the current way this works is for the best and your suggestion will be a net negative that leads to more stationary play in all modes.

10243335,0,t1_dc4x5gj,Those pistols are all pretty powerful weapons. The draw back is that if you equip a pistol you cant equip an antititan weapon. The grenadier class of primaries dont do as much damage to Titans as a dedicated antititan so youre at that disadvantage in any game type that includes Titans. Of course in Pilots v Pilots you dont need an antititan weapon so any of those pistols is a good grab.To go into more specific detail Wingman has somewhat low range and hipfire accuracy but is a two shot kill to the body or a one shot kill to the head. With amped weapons and close to medium range it is a oneshot kill anywhere on the body.Wingman Elite is a projectile weapon which means you have to lead your shots. It has pinpoint accuracy even during hip fire. Unlike the normal Wingman however it can not oneshot bodyshot when amped. Also has great range.Mozambique for whatever reason happens to have great range and good accuracy when hip fired. There arent too many cons to this gun aside from the fact that the projectiles have a travel time. ,titanfall,dc550dl,6,t5_2xh0g

10320274,0,t3_5ns5ei,Text from the articlegtHello PilotsJay here. Happy New Year! Last year we said that we were committed to supporting Titanfall  for the long haul and this journey began with the release of Angel Citys Most Wanted and were just getting started. We have many things in the works for Titanfall  players in  and today were excited to reveal whats next.gtIn our next content drop coming soon well be introducing a brandnew mode called Live Fire a lightning fast v Pilot only mode that brings competitive close quarter combat to the forefront. A roundbased best of  mode with no respawns you will have one minute to eliminate the opposing team in order to win the round. You can also win the round if your team is holding the neutral flag when the round timer ends.  Its fast frantic and sure to help hone those teamwork and mobility skills. Were also introducing two brand new maps designed specifically for Live Fire Stacks and Meadow. Playable only in the Live Fire playlist these two maps are tight enclosed death boxes designed specifically for the fastpaced intense nature of the mode. gtIn addition to Live Fire and the two new dedicated maps for that mode were also going to be introducing a brandnew Coliseum map called Columns as well as another Pilot execution wait until you see this one! and multiple new Commander intros for each Faction. Well have more details on when youll be getting your hands on this soon and everything in this update will be free for all Titanfall  players.gtWeve also been working on a significant update to our playlist interface. We agree with much of the feedback that having game modes split between two screens is not an ideal user experience. The team has been working to introduce a brand new interface for the next content drop on consoles and possibly a bit earlier on PC so we can test it out. Below you can check out our work in progress to give you an idea how it will change.gtOur goal is to allow players to create their own mixtapes and choose which modes they want to be matched in. Would you like to match in just Attrition Amped Hardpoint and Last Titan Standing? Simply select the modes you want and hit play. Well talk more about this and more in the coming weeks.gtEverything else is still highly classified but hopefully you are starting to get a sense at how were planning to support Titanfall  postlaunch. Soon we will reveal our roadmap for the next couple months that will have more maps including remasters of more maps from Titanfall weapons modes and more.gtStay tuned to titanfallgame for updates this is going to be an exciting year for Titanfall . Thanks for your support!,titanfall,dcduykc,21,t5_2xh0g

10329975,0,t1_dcenp42,Ive been getting my Titans up to Gen  just got done Ion and since Im working by chassis Im onto Tone. One thing that Ive noticed with people is that they dont rush when I put my shield down. Like they dont know that they can go through it or something. Scorches just stay back Ronins just dash around Ions try to poke it with laser shot. The best way to destroy Tone is to get in her face idk if this is common knowledge but it annoys me now when I see people act like shes god tier or something.,titanfall,dceyl3p,1,t5_2xh0g
10330043,0,t1_dce45mi,Northstars kit makes sense to me its all about mobility and awareness. You got the railgun sniper the main part of the kit encouraging you to use your two dashes I like to bring  personally peeking in and out of cover doing some serious damage. You can mix up the peek pattern by hovering and shooting. I dont know about anyone else but the people I get matched with NEVER have the awareness to immediately roast a midair NS like you all say happens all the time. If you get caught in close quarters toss a trap down and maybe some smoke to disorient then dash away. Cluster missile is a nice multipurpose tool wave clear antipilot or extra antititan DPS. Also yes the core is underwhelming but with viper thrusters which I consider a musthave mobility is key for NS it becomes pretty fun. It isnt so much about the damage but I find that if you rocket over an enemy titans head while bombarding them with missiles they usually get pretty disoriented. They may also turn to face you letting your team attack freely from behind. Just pop a trap and smoke and dash away when the core ends to increase survivability. ,titanfall,dceyv2q,1,t5_2xh0g

10331499,1,t3_5nxg5m,BF is the biggest disappointment of . And yes Im including No Mans Sky. The only way to play the game without seeing a full team of assaults with Automatico s is to play Hardcore. And then you just get a full team of snipers. The Singleplayer is mediocre at best and the multiplayer balancing is garbage looking at you Shotguns. At least in Titanfall  the only real balancing issues are Tone and the Spitfire. IW was also incredibly mediocre mostly due to the fact that there are guns that are straight up better than another gun. Also Supply Drops are trash. Overwatch on the other hand is actually good well balanced and regularly updated by Blizzard.,titanfall,dcf4ssv,1,t5_2xh0g
10331616,0,t1_dcf4uxb,Yeah I definitely will use it. The only reason I stick mostly to Attrition is because of the inclusion of PilotvPilot in Mixtape. Now that I can have those other game modes without PvP Ill be branching out more. ,titanfall,dcf59z5,31,t5_2xh0g

Laser shot is a hitscan one hit kill against pilots at all ranges. Ion is the best for goosers. EDIT I guess its just almost always a one hit kill against pilots though not in really extreme long ranges. Ive played a ton of Ion and have never had it not kill a pilot in practical play however This may be obvious to a lot of people but Ive seen people confused by this Laser shot does not require any sort of charge. It may appear similar to a Charge Rifle but you can release immediately and still get a full powered shot.,titanfall,dcw49tv,5,t5_2xh0g

10510817,0,t1_dczf3fc,Australian players have less than  players in attrition at any given day and they can still find games within  seconds of searching. So if youre trying to make a point that dead game is dead youre not making a very good one.I also find it funny how you try to suggest that good players are the reason for the games low population. Poor sales and low player retention? Blame the tryhards! I cant possibly see any other explanation for this.Youre trying to imply that good players who regularly pubstomp are deterring other players from getting into the game. But when you apply that logic to any other game the whole argument falls apart. People regularly pubstomp in games like battlefield and call of duty but coincidentally those games dont exactly have a low population. How peculiar is it then that this only applies titanfall .Maybe the low population is not due to pubstompers but instead due to poor marketing resulting in poor sales resulting in bad publicity. Numbers were already low from the start and as these things tend to go they get lower as time goes on. Are good players the direct cause for the low population? So far you have given me zero evidence to suggest that. So forgive me if I find it ridiculous that you would suggest that in the first place.,titanfall,dczigwc,-1,t5_2xh0g

And yes Legion cam take down tones shield. But in the time it takes to do that tone can put two barrages and while Legion is reloading assuming he had to use his power shot or was in long range mode there is another barrage hit. And those three barrages could have been enough to charge the salvo core and fire it over and behind legion completely ignoring the shield.And Ronin is supposed to be Tones hard counter but once you bait out the phase dash and use splash damage to build locks thats about it. Ronin will kill Tone in the end if hes committed. But without flanking or a surprise hell take considerable damage. ,titanfall,dd104g7,5,t5_2xh0g

Anything more and youll start to feel depressed after being stomped into the ground over and over again. You might get good enough to be competitive however youll still get matched up with hardcores that just mow you down.Honestly if you havent played yet but own a console refund it and head to a console version much more parity and even competition.

Its much slower and more careful than Titanfall and thanks to all the twitch combat in Titanfall my aim is way better in R.I recently gave Deus Ex Mankind Divided another run through. Its nice to just be able to do what you want to and explore after Ts chaos.Killing Floor  lets you redirect your focus from PvP to PvE for a different kind of action. Its also got British guys rambling about money which is nice.SWAT  finally got a digital release on GOG.com and thats a blast to play.

10574899,0,t1_dd6p5fd,Ah okay. Lag switching is an old school term and was popular when games were often clienthost based. Basically whoever had the fastest connection ran that instance of the game on their system and everyone else connected to them. A lagswitch was something a host would use to intermittently cut off the connection for idk a half second or less every  seconds basically giving him a huge advantage since everyone else would basically be standing still. Its how online play used to work on og Xbox and  for alot of games like halo cod etc. Now most stuff is run on servers so its not even possible I dont think.

Again just because youre not good at using the tactical doesnt mean its bad. I highly doubt you can do every maneuver phased that you could with grapple such as grappling the top of the ship on crash site. Grapple is the ultimate flanking tool phase shift is useful for flanking if youre seen by the enemy. Instead of running on the wall in a lot of cases you can just grapple over it and build up a ton of momentum. ,titanfall,dd77q7a,1,t5_2xh0g

Im a gen . on ion and the biggest thing about ion is you have all these strong tools but cant use them all in a single fight effectively. I mean they have like the lowest DPS of all titans easily with their primary fire aside scorch and even the split shot you have to be very close to to get good damage out of it.

This is why two or more tones are so dangerous its a never ending hammer pounding away at everything in front of it with a speedy core that will destroy any full health titan unlucky enough to be in front of it. Like you can play well against a scorch and come out unscratched even legion and Ion you can take minimal damage and Northstar depending on your positioning can be very clean but tone is always always always taking a third to half your health even if its a godawful player. ,titanfall,ddhorco,2,t5_2xh0g

Basically its a highdamage rapidfire sniper rifle. The range on this thing is amazing it only takes  bullets to kill someone and even if at first you miss the first  bullets that it takes it to revup its followed my a barrage of bullets.ampnbspSo it doesnt take a lot of skill to master it and its incredibly OP when used correctly. ,titanfall,ddqqr2e,3,t5_2xh0g

10774071,0,t3_5u4dd8,I find that holo pilot works SO well on this map because a lot of the action tends to concentrate around that central hallway and there are lots of smaller passages for pilots to traverse. Any time you go through a door or if you see enemy fire on the mini map hang back and send a hologram out there. If it starts taking hits send another and run with it. The enemies around the corner MIGHT see two pilots run around a corner  but by then it will be too late THEYRE ALL DEAD because you shot them while they were distracted by your holos.I freaking love holo pilot. I also get good use with cloak pilot on this map. At the start of the match I flank hard I go out of my way to take the long way around. Cloak as you approach where the shootout is occurring so they dont see you coming in their periphery. Collect ALL the kills. Your faction leader will be going bonkers.,titanfall,ddr9n1a,1,t5_2xh0g

10785605,0,t1_ddsb2r8,If they keep it in the air then he drops down when its done. However if he drops to the ground then does he get points for landing on people? If it drops wrong and he lands on a roof or boxes then does he get to stay there? Those would be bigger bugs then simply letting it happen in mid air. If they added an air seperated one then that would fine but If they take it away all together then what do the other titans gain or lose to even it out. Thats part of fixing a bug is having it still come out balanced. In case you missed the part that said he does fly to places where other titans cant go. So adding a feature could make it worse.

Within the central lane theres two outer lanes that go around the center buildings and a middle lane that cuts directly through. Colony has the same thing with two lanes that go around the map and a central lane with all the buildings.

10880746,0,t1_de28fe1,you had saidgtId rank it third behind the devotion and hemlock in terms of weapons that kill me the most.in regards to guns people would complain about.... this was your words. so basically meaning that if everyone hypothetically started using any other weapon in the game more  it deserves to be complained about lol. theres nothing to misinterpret.  but anyways. Like jay said balancing is an ongoing process. I just hope that they dont just make half the guns in the game useless to use one gun already at this point.  the volt due to everyone complaining about the whatever  guns that kill them.i bet if i convinced everyone to use cold war for a week  Ive been getting killed by the cold war too much. it needs a nerf would pop up. lol. but anyways. it doesnt matter to me  i can learn to adapt. just because a gun is or isnt used doesnt mean it is or isnt OP.  my top  was actually a joke directed at predicting what people would probably complain about next.,titanfall,de29sfk,2,t5_2xh0g

In TF| To procced to next gen you had to complete certain challenges. In TF| there is camoare callsigns for Gen  so... what if every  generations player need to do the same complete certain challenges as in TF| in order to procced to  etc gen?

You then provide evidence by providing a picture of Billy.gt Does the majority opinion prove that Billy is taller than Bob? No it doesnt.I never once said the majority opinion is proof itself. I said that the majority opinion is backed up my ingame evidence and as such theres a pretty damn good reason as to why the majority is under that particular idea. At no point have I said Well most people think the Hemlok is overpowered so it is. I said that most people think its overpowered for a reason a reason that is supported.Im not arguing that because most people say so it is so. Im arguing that theres a good reason most people say so. Its a good reason because its supported by evidence from numerous people performing different tests not just mine.gt Stop being butthurt because you dont know how to formulate an argument properly.In what way have I been butthurt?

10909381,0,t1_de57fhi,There is a boost called phase rewind  what this boost does is when activated it basically phases you into a alternate dimension where you arent visible to enemies and cant be killed while your phased. It puts you into the phase dimension and rewinds you back a few seconds.  So lets say for example you turn a corner and your in an enemies sight get shot but not killed.  If you active phase rewind before your killed and it will rewind you back to before you turned that corner thus no longer being in the enemies sight and kind of giving you a second chance.  Only problem is the time to kill is so quick in this game you usually dont have enough time to react and use the phase rewind. To add to that in my opinion the phase rewind doesnt rewind you far enough to be effective.  In my experience there really isnt many instances where the boost is useful and your better off choosing other boosts.,titanfall,de584hc,1,t5_2xh0g

If this were to happen Ronin can continously melee a Titan until he either manually ejects or become doomed in order perform the executing while Scorch can use his firewall until the opponent tries to manually eject or becomes doomed.. This would destroy Stealth autoeject even further and would make manual eject completely useless and pointless at the same time.. Now I dont care much about new pilots but this would make it more frustrating to them as some do not know much about the game nor how the Titan gameplay works. Not only that this would also piss off some older players.,titanfall,de7qk0o,1,t5_2xh0g

11078538,0,t3_5y6xqf,As mentioned the Single Player Campaign is an EXCELENT way to learn the movement system and to feel out each Titan. Its short about  hours and has one of the most enjoyable levels I have played in a LONG time.otherwise...  Learn the movement system! Learn to Slide Hop Strafe hop chain wall runs together. Learn to use Stim without getting hungup on the Couches at Complex or the rocks along Hamburger Hill in Crash Site. TiF is awash with a TON of Destiny and COD transplants so vertical combat and moving with sustained speed are the hard counter to the low and slow style of play. Once you know the movement system you can stray off the beaten path and make your own routes and openers. GameInReview and FrothyOmen are two excellent You Tube Teachers. The Pilot Gauntlet in the Campaign training is also a great practice tool that allows you to practice to shoot while moving plus how to chain moves together to maintain speed in a noncombat environment. Keep playing. The more you play the more you will learn the layout of the maps. If you pay attention youll learn where people camp where they set sentries and in general how people move around the map. By knowing where to hunt you can be the hunter instead of the prey.  Get all the main guns to level  plus play all the Pilot boosts tacticals and abilities before you regenerate. This way youll know what items you play the best with so you can permaunlock them with credits instead of waiting for the experience unlock.  A Learn how to aim grenades. This is the best way to deal with AWall and Hardwall campers while on the move. Plus Firestars will blind Titans if you hit them in the face if you are getting your ass kicked by one type of Titan learn that Titan! This way you get first hand experience how people attack and counter. Then you take that knowledge and apply it to your Titan of Choice,titanfall,denqq6l,3,t5_2xh0g

Steps might not actually be necessary since the weights themselves are supposed to stick out but... theyre round and the shape is angled so I wanted to maintain angles.

11193349,0,t1_df0onft,In the same boat here I really loved using the Volt in the campaign so I thought that would be the same for Multiplayer. However after playing with it for a few games I realized that my playstyle is just moving too damn fast and in close quarters for it to be viable against someone using any other SMG Shotgun or even most Auto Rifles.It is certainly a fun gun but I feel without a slight damage buff or slight rate of fire increase it is too hard to compete against most other weapons.,titanfall,df0r43x,2,t5_2xh0g
11194337,0,t1_df0ruk7,Well let me explain further than since you are so insistent On the xbox platform youll still see really fast movement especially flag runs. Youll see a lot of in air cuts wall bounces etc. What you wont see is the PC type of level of movement where EVERYONE is constantly moving. Instead youll see lots of positional movement... going from one rooftop camp to another. On PS you see straight boots on the ground gameplay. Like something out of COD. Its even worse. Flag runs are people running on the ground lol. Its a bit different ya know? PS gifs and videos have been far worse even lol. And people that have played both platforms all say the ps platform has the inferior player base. What else should i go by? What im complaining about in this thread is the simple fact that at higher levels of play the  dominates on console. This ruins the intense mobility the game would otherwise have at these levels of it werent for these strong mid to long range weapons with an incredible amount of aimassist. flatline g are also to blame here but im focusing on the number  gun which is the . If the game didnt have an AR or LMG class altogether and everyone was forced to use SMGS the console game would be a lot more mobile. Thats what im saying here. Is that clear enough for you? ,titanfall,df0v536,1,t5_2xh0g

11197177,0,t3_5zu5m4,I strongly prefer the R and I think I do better with it. But I always wonder if I should be using the alternator instead because if Im going to be using an SMG I want to be using the best one. The two reasons this decision always fucks with me are All those times when there is a player in the match who is totally dominating with like  kills and  deaths or something in that range they are using the alternator. It never fails. Rarely if ever have I seen those guys using the R.Correspondingly any time I get dropped so fast I cant even tell where the bullets were coming from I watch on the kill cam and its the alternator. I realize that the TTKs with the guns are like within . seconds of each other but the alternator sure does seem noticeably quicker when I use it and especially when its used against me. Not ever really feeling satisfied on this issue i just concluded for myself that since my aim is shitty Im better off with the R because of higher ROF. Basically its quantity over quality. Also I am not well versed in tap firing which is required to be accurate on the alternator at long range. I think like others have said that If I could aim well enough to always land all my shots Id prefer the alternator. TLDR for elite players with perfect aim the alternator is best for plebs like me with crap aim the R works better because its more forgiving with higher ROF and larger clip size.,titanfall,df16q4d,1,t5_2xh0g

Ill be sure to not shoot you if I see you.The alternator has really good hip fire accuracy so  of them time you wont need to aim down sights unless you really want to. Try to get as close as possible when hip firing and youll find that youll kill pretty quickly with the alternator. Also like everyone keeps saying you shouldnt ever stop moving. That includes when youre shooting at someone. Thing is none of the people who are really good at this game are campers or walkers. They pretty much fly and touch the ground every once in a while. Most of the time mobility pays off. Every once in a while youll get picked off by good old aim assist but otherwise its going to give you the upper hand. If you end up in a face to face I would try to wallrun and hipfire which works really well for alternator. If there are no walls give sliding a try.,titanfall,df2r4eu,2,t5_2xh0g

11246327,0,t1_df6peld,It is the same principals across platforms.For a summary on PCFirst turn off Toggle Crouch. If youre slidehopping and chaining it well to wallrunning then IMO it is MUCH easier to do by just pressing crouch when you need it and letting go when you dontneed to kick off a wall.The Method Run forward Jump Let go of forward and Hold crouch hold left or right then the moment you hit the ground jump again. For turning hold a Key A or D for the direction you want to go and slowly turn your mouse in that direction as well. Dont turn too quickly or you will lose momentum. Dont double jump while holding a direction and NOT turning that direction as it will obliterate your momentum. Continue holding crouch the whole time and when you get a wall that you want to run on let go of crouch and start parkouring.,titanfall,df6r61q,6,t5_2xh0g

Ions is obvious you see the lazer being formed. Just jump behind a tree find cover. When I play scorch I throw a trap dash behind a wall then ignite it. Ions slow movement leaves him vulnerable. Its the same thing with legion Ill give you that one no way to tell. If youre playing ronin drop a smokescreen and flank him. Tone......well there is legit nothing you can do about that. Both her rocket salvos pop up and there is a pause before she starts firing but it doesnt even matter. Its hard to do anything about scorchs core but seeing as though hes such a difficult character to play its kinda fair.Ridding the game of these mechanics would make the game a bit boring.

11259678,1,t1_df7zyuo,Different does not mean its good. Every match plays out the exact same by the end playstyles are vastly limited and mobile players are punished severely by trying to make plays. Legion and scorch vastly outperform all other titans on this map. The design favors people fighting from uphill to the point where you simply cant actually traverse uphill without either completely exposing yourself or walking very slowly while being completely exposed. If by different you mean funneling people and forcing them to have shootouts that other games do MUCH better at sure enjoy crash site. Its still an objectively bad map that does not belong in a game that built its strengths doing the exact opposite. Loving the downvotes give me a map that is a bunch of Swiss cheese boxes and nothing else and that is better than crash site because the gameplay of titanfall  is wildly open ended when given a sandbox to play in. Having a map that forces you into anything is a failure. ,titanfall,df89ncy,-3,t5_2xh0g

11274966,0,t1_df9zqlt,I disagree I think the existing core compliments the loadout well. Flight would be a lot less effective on Tone since Tone doesnt have a tether to trap enemies with allowing them to escape easier. Salvo also doesnt work as an escape ability like Flight can for cornered Northstars. Northstars core helps fill in gaps where is is generally weak currently frontloading more ranged damage would make it a worse Titan in my opinion.Not to mention that it only makes sense that the flying Titan has the flight based core and the Titan based around tracking rockets has a core based around tracking rockets. Swapping them around just would be really wonky.,titanfall,dfa01q2,1,t5_2xh0g

Maybe they shouldnt put so much emphasis on the sword since its not used that much but that doesnt stop you from learning how to play the gameBecause swords are cool and the sword IS used offensively with sword core and arc wave.

Movement how titans work maps camping so on.They couldnt scratch a pilot because Respawn wanted them that way. They were like creeps in a moba. They werent intended to kill pilots. Now they do absolutely nothing other than be there just because Respawn couldnt risk removing them from attrition aswell. Well PvP was added later then removed after like a week and then readded never touched it. I forgot about LTS wasnt a fanEven if the grunts were useless they kept you on your toes prevented campers gave noobies the impression they were doing good and contributing to the fight thus didnt need to camp etc. Also helped them get their titan faster which helps the entire team if they are bad and cant kill pilots.,titanfall,dffsrsg,8,t5_2xh0g

What should I have done differently? It was hard for Titanfall players to answer that through their experience. So we went back to the drawing board so we could fix this.idk seems like hes talking more about the MP than anything. People complained about the lack of content in the MP also.

11433137,0,t1_dfrsfap,Welcome!As others have said you should prolly start with Attrition. It is the most friendly to beginners. CTF can get very steamrolly especially if one team gets multiple titans before the others PvP and Live Fire are where the sharks hang out when you get your skills down they are a BLAST. LTS is the most tactical of the game modes. You have to plan ahead and work with your team to have any success there. Bounty Hunt is basically Attrition for people who want an actual tactical challenege. You have to not only kill the AI and enemy players you have to defend your takings and return them to the bank. It really ups the challenge from Attrition but also adds a lot of satisfaction.I played several hundreds of hours of the original and am probably around  hours in to this one on the PC. I am not superelite shark but I am pretty good. My personal queue is made up of only Bounty Hunt Amped Hardpoint Last Titan Standing and Live Fire. I use it for solo queueing and for running with my friends. Well often play whatevers featured if its a mode we like but double xp kinda stops mattering after youve regenerated a few times. We love those  matches in a mixtape because we get pretty low wait times and we face a pretty high skill level of players.Get your chops down and come join us!,titanfall,dfrxndv,8,t5_2xh0g
11434386,0,t1_dfrx05c,Its not even close to being a question. If you play competitively at all everyone knows the arc grenade is hands down the way to go.

11440050,0,t3_63b31n,Alas I have to put the PS to rest in preparation for exams. I would have gladly fought with you.Play the campaign. It will help you a lot and the campaign itself is really good.Give all the Titans a try up to their second Generation. Generations are essentially prestige levels if you know what Im saying.All the Assault rifles are good starters. I personally prefer the R with default scope for starters. Once you got the hang of that you can graduate to other guns like the SemiAuto G. A quick tips for the G dont worry about landing precise shots with it focus more on getting as many shots in as possible. The recoil on it is not bad so even if you miss one shot it isnt going to screw you up.The CAR is a good SMG. Use the quick scope attachment and maybe Gunrunner. Like the  and  its a good middle of the road gun for beginners. The R is hands down the hardest SMG to master but the most rewarding once you get a hang of it.Lots of beginners like he Devotion but give the LStar some love. With the gunrunner mod equipped you can really lay waste to your enemies at close range. If you like not having to reload give the Spitfire a try. Just make sure to shoot that in bursts and you wont have to worry that much about recoil.Dont touch the snipers for a bit. Those can be difficult to master and the risk vs. reward can be too much for some in a game where movement is key to survival.Grenadiers are the most fun weapons you can use in the game. Theres a learning g curve to them but theres great satisfaction in getting kills with them. An amped SMR can really piss Titans off while the Cold War is the ultimate Death from above weapon that can kill players in one direct hit. The EPG is a faster and more precise version of the Cold War and along with the Softball are the two weapons that seperate the men from the boys in this game.All Pistols are great. An amped Wingman can one shot enemies but the Mozambique is my personal favourite. The P can take a little time to get a hang of but you should really try it out.Tacticals Grapple is great and all that but Pulse Blades is GREAT for scanning rooms and objectives for enemy Pilots. Holo pilot doesnt get as much love as it deserves. In objective based game modes like Amped Hard point you can bait players really good with it. Its also great for fooling pilot sentries if you particularly hate those.Save your credits! When you RegeneratePrestige your unlocks get reset. Use credits to permanently unlock the weapons tacticals boosts and Titan s you love the most.We have a network on the PS! Its tag is RDIT and we have plenty of players during the evening hours. Invite the network to some matches have you headset on and chat it up with the network because thats how you will get yourself some Titanfall friends!Send me a friend request xTLx.

11482549,0,t3_63tsm2,Holy shit this is beyond hilarious.I move like a Grunt therefore grenadier weapons are OP and must be nerfed but I havent actually used them so I dont have any actual experience with them.Seriously if youre dying to any of the grenadier weapons theres only a few scenarios that explain why. Youre getting killed by splash damage which means you need to start moving faster than a Stalker in molasses. Youre getting killed by direct hits which means youre being incredibly predictable in your movement andor the enemy is very good at the game and understands shot leading and therefore would probably be killing you regardless of what weapon they were using.If you ever tried to use grenadier weapons youd learn that they are some of the toughest to actually use due to being very slow projectiles and being incredibly punishing if you miss. But no you hide behind a false shield of principle claiming that you dont use OP weapons while continuing to use the R one of the most OP weapons currently in the game.Incredible.,titanfall,dfxjmdz,47,t5_2xh0g

11525859,0,t1_dg2focg,yeah this is one of the main problems as well and an indirect fix to this kind of thing would be to nerf melee. Sure youd still get some hits through walls and shit but it wouldnt instantly kill you at least plus people would be less likely to be spamming it in the first place. The thing Ive noticed is that highmobility games like TF and Overwatch and stuff tend to have weaker melees due to the possibility of like a scout or tracer type character just running up and meleeing you before you have a chance to respond. Meanwhile T has the highest mobility and speed out of any FPS Ive ever seen yet it has the oneshot melees of a CoD game where its fine because if someone manages to get up close to you in a more grounded game like that then you deserve to die. Meanwhile in T like why bother even having a shotgun in the game if the melee fills the role of closerange high DPS with unlimited ammo? Any way you cut it the oneshot melee is just bad design in a game like this.And people can claim oh get gud or whatever but it just isnt fun to play against especially in situations like what you posted and its certainly not friendly to new players something T does not need more of.,titanfall,dg2ghw8,0,t5_2xh0g

Awall has a designed weakness wherein its quite flankable. Cloak has a designed weakness wherein its constantly visible to the welltrained eye. Pulse Blade has a designed weakness where the knife can be destroyed plus the pulses arent all that frequent. So on.

If however youre human like the rest of us you wont ever have perfect accuracy and thus you will miss shots.

Usually came to who had better positioning and awareness not who got their core first. Titanfall  is faster only because the battles are over quicker and rely much less on base player skill. While all these fights were going on you could be obstructed by dropships drop pods pilots rodeoing the old way was more epic AI fights going on Titan OS customized which it more personal and intense active machinery and a seemingly more large scale conflict which all contribute to making Titanfall feel like an epic battle and Titanfall  feel vastly less immersive ,titanfall,dgw190y,1,t5_2xh0g
