4371412,0,t3_3b2aoq,I agree that this game can be constantly frustrating at times but I understand that developers need to find some tactics for players to pay real money because in the end its still business. Im just glad that its not super frustrating to the point that I feel I NEED to pay to advance further into the game. The things that are bothering me right now are Im already short on storage capacity but with each new updates there are new sets of items to store! The wise thing to do is to store all land expansion items storage expansion items Vu items Tokyo items and now beach expansion items. I always find myself at full capacity and need to sell items that I dont want to sell... For example Im at  cameras  storage bars and  locks right now. I need  each to expand my storage space.... The game keeps giving me cameras and bars so I have no choice but to sell the extras when Im at capacity and it breaks my heart because they are so hard to come by.  GTHQ is probably on everybodys list but I must say this is where most of my frustrations come from. You need to constantly do the  secs refresh and most likely you wont find the items you need. And if you do its probably sold already by the time you get to it. And if its not sold you click on it and you get the stupid llama message. And when everything is good I find myself at full capacity and cannot buy any more items. I think the developers are just trying to teach us that resources are scarce and its how the real market works. How educational roll eyes Seriously where are all the Vu items now? It was flooding with them some weeks ago and now there are none when I need them for golden keys for my beach!!But its a fun game nevertheless.

4938715,0,t3_3ijdpn,The game gets progressively harder as you get more RZ and building RZ gets you xp which makes you level up. The number and difficulty of items requested by the cargo ship VU tower cost to build RZ goes up with more RZ and as you gain levels.Leveling up also opens up access to more things which can be good you can sell more expensive things but it also increases the amount of choices you might get out of a bubble both thought bubble in your own city and gift bubbles in others which may make it more difficult to get something particularly desirable.It can be a pain to manage increasing numbers of items required for storage expansions and items for the cargo ship etc. all at the same time. So some people camp for this reason to focus only on one or two things instead of a bunch of different stuff. Level  is popular because thats the level that expansions are opened up and some people will camp there until they have opened their entire map.Some people camp in order to save money before hitting certain levels. Level sewage level police level waste management level health all of which are required services and can carry a hefty price tag for the best buildings.

And the k gold and  x coins are a nice prize imo.  plat keys i wish they had more buildings for them and buildings that cost less.  They dont have any cheap plat buildings.Tips for COMPlan ahead!If you need to do  glass for example get your factories cranking out at least  of those before you start the task.  When they are finished let them sit there and wait until you start the task to collect.  Then fire up another  and your done within  cycle after starting your task saves time and allows you to work on other things while your glass is cooking.Pay green dollars simcash? to add slots to your production buildings.  If you have to make  bags of concrete and you have  available slots on your building store or we store it is  you can make all of them before you start the task.  Then you start the task collect all  and your done with that task within minutes instead of hours.Same with upgrading zones.  If you have to upgrade  parisian zones make sure you get your  paris items first.  Then reroll your zones until you have all three of them ready to upgrade.  hint if you want easy  item upgrades demo some residential zones and put up brand new parisian zones instead  .   then start the task do your three upgrades and task done within minutes not hours.When i have to do air or ship cargo deliveries  i wait until i have the ship  plane loaded and all i have to click is cast off or whatever.  then i start the task.   I always make sure to have enough simcash to refresh it until complete so this goes pretty quickly depending on what items they want you to load as cargo.  hint  keep as much extra inventory on you as you can eventually you will use it and it comes in handy in these competitions.Dont collect your taxes EVER unless you are on a COM simolian task.   This way it builds up to thousands and thousands so if you have to collect k simolians  start the task collect taxes and if you dont complete instantly it will probably be pretty close.  These simolian tasks are super easy.  You can buy simolians with simcash and it counts toward your total.  Or you can just buy items from the trade hq and then sell them yourself and it counts as well.   Also if your in a rush bulldoze some parks or some upgraded roads for a quick simolian boost.  Also before you start a simolian task make sure you load your trade depot with high value items and wait for them to sell but dont collect.  Once you start the task collect them and youll get a good head start right away.Never use your Vu tower unless on a COM Vu tower task.  Save all of your Vu items for the COM.   These tasks pay well and are pretty easy. Always go for the highest point tasks anything under  is pretty weak and under  is pretty much worthless.  Save all the small ones for the end when you dont have enough time left to do big tasks and try to cram a bunch of small ones in the last    hours.I basically start out looking for anything I can do right away or fairly quickly..  zone upgrades  vu distasters  simolians etc..I start working on one of those but before I do I find a factory task glass for example and start building that.  I have  capacity with all my factories so if there are tasks that are less than  I do those first as long as the points are good.  Then I can finish them within minutes of starting the task once the factories proc. Then once i have that rolling Ill look for any zone upgrades and start gathering what I need for those.   If I have any airship cargo I start planning for those as well.   Then I will look at production tasks  such as  business suits and start building toward those.   It takes a little strategizing but if you stick to the high point tasks and plan ahead to complete tasks quickly you will dominate these contests.  I am fp and dont spend a dime of real money on this game.

If Im not taking all of their sugar I buy from the bottom right so that Im most likely to leave their advertised lot in place. That way it stays visible on the market and other people can get some.

I also forgo collecting my taxes regularly during CoM as those alone are K or so per day easily enough to satisfy a Simoleons task. You dont have to start the produce and collect assignment before the material is ready to collect  this is PARTICULARLY valuable for store crafts vs. factory crafts.  Just start the assignment before you collect the first item it doesnt matter how long the item has been sitting there glowing at you. Golden tickets  save them  they can be used to purchase up to  extra assignments after youve used up your task allotment.  If you want to get the good prizes in the higher leagues youll need them. Contest rank doesnt do anything but it does show you how many CoM points you have to earn to level up which gets you more platinum keys and golden tickets each time.,SCBuildIt,dcy7si0,2,t5_35nb2

10752550,0,t3_5tu676,Oh and this onegtIm wondering if its best to focus on either education or transportation or if I should do both at the same time.It doesnt really matter. If space is at a premium I believe transportation has smaller footprints overall but these arent missioncritical. Sooner or later you will be able to easily add both but youre going to need a supply of gold keys first so unless you have the Cargo Ship dock built its a moot point. Youre getting ahead of yourself here is what Im saying.,SCBuildIt,ddp1kdh,2,t5_35nb2

10886954,0,t3_5vkexb,Is it EAs fault or is it G fault? G has been glitchy and problematic for  yrs. I stopped using G around winter update  due to so many frustrating problems. As a matter of fact I stopped connecting my cities to Google Play around the same time.In addition to your post now there have been two recent posts complaining about problems with friending with G. Considering this has been ongoing for two years.... is it really an EATT problem? Or a Google problem they have yet to resolve despite numerous complaints to Google these past yrs.,SCBuildIt,de2wtzw,2,t5_35nb2

11207619,0,t3_5zzrao,See I would find the game super boring if I just bought my way through everything.  The satisfaction of finding each and every one of those dmn storage items and maxing out the delight in winning CoM because I earned my Maxis Manor etc. make the game fun for me.

Mostly because the amount of data is so vast that nobody gives a shit about me anymore. DI have to admit however that I am appreciating my chance to start a new city from scratch. I made some bad tactical moves right from the beginning before I knew whether or not Id be able to be consistent about the game that really cost me in the long run. ,SCBuildIt,df2uhfn,1,t5_35nb2

As a graphic artist my forte is step and repeat pattern design especially as it relates to publication design like magazines newspapers and catalogues. It comes in handy in designing residential floorplans a hobby and of course SCBI road design and city layouts lol.My newest city is L I am pushing for max pop each level just to see what can be done. Current pop is k I know I can reach k but not certain about k which will open airport. I think if I relocate the commercial stores I just might be able to reach k.STATS  total pop   with  RZ fully upgraded plus  RZ partially upgraded giving a base pop of  BOOSTS  Parks   Landscaping   Education   Transportation By adding another University Heliport and Joggers Path I can bring pop up to k. Ill have to see what I can do to tweak for k. BTW Im experimenting with a continuous loop road layout design with this city. ,SCBuildIt,dfo0qp0,1,t5_35nb2

11503535,0,t3_6477ae,It takes weeks not hours to get expansion items. Most of them are within the first few minutes of playing each day and then the probability drops off. Its much better to play a little bit each day than for hours at a time. I think you also get more by visiting other cities so click on random items in the trade center to get there.Stop building residences! Its a trap you think youre making money because each residence you build gives you money but it also gives you experience which levels you up and each level introduces new infrastructure requirements which costs more money than you made.So the best thing to do is slow down. Time is money! And see the camping guide MICRO posted for lots more information.,SCBuildIt,dfzxcfn,3,t5_35nb2

Also entertainment sports Academia medical resort and tourist industry a wide range of transportation workers and professionals law enforcement government clergy retail workers dock workers and a bustling airport with nonstop flight service .As far as eating they order their groceries and get take out from a neighboring city which uses helicopters for delivery. Sonetimes rez eat out at the Alpine cafe or the Mtn Hotels Restaurant. And of course theres always fast food at the Burger Joint Donut Shop and the Snack Markets and Delicacy Markets. Oh yes  the Club house on the golf course also has a restaurant and the Luxury Marina has one as well. The beach front Mall has a food court and fresh sushi is always available from the catch of the day off of Sailermans Pier. Plus the sports fishing boats always bring back something interesting.Edit  dont forget the Farmers market has a wide variety of food stuff available as well! The finest wine can be procured from the Mtn vinyards and each Gasthaus proudly boasts of their own microbrewery. Dont forget the French cafes and London pubs the casinos each have their own restaurant and so do the Hotels.
