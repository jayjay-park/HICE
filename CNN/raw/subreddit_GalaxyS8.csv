11476930,0,t3_63rsee,The reason thats NEVER EVER covered by the tech media for why the apps are preinstalled is that they cant not be. They either provide secure data bridges into Knox containers or otherwise integrate into apps that do.    Regardless of the pressure the tech media have been putting on Samsung to slow down their innovation there are actually good reasons that easily resolve any complaint that the tech media perpetuate.They made every s app that is optional optional including the s music app which is actually great and the only way to get volume normalization and gapless playback to work on Android for local audio files.   I actually think its a shame that they were pressured to remove it. So many people dont realize how good it is which is basically how the game to suppress rd party android development is played.     If Google uses their influence over the media get their way Samsung will be pressured into debloating even more which would only rob us of more technology they never cover which allows Google to retread the same steps years later but in a way that benefits Google analytics and Adsense versus Android as a platform its community and its users. Look into Knox vs android for work.Google committed to Knox originally as the secure platform for android but instead recently backed out cloned it down to the interface and gutted it of any tools that users could actually use that might violate their TOS  like how we can easily use Knox to do thisGo figure . percent of people think that Knox is somehow bloat and just a way to prevent rooting and modding when in fact its the most powerful set of security tools that have ever been freely made available to consumers. Its James Bond style hardware integrated security and privacy platform thats even certified for use by the NSA. ,GalaxyS8,dfwwm80,5,t5_2wi4l

11527229,0,t3_64falw,I hate the Spigen SlimArmor on my galaxy s. The case is all beat to hell because with it i can toss my phone around and not worry. The back of the case has black spots and scratches on it where the case has been slide arcross tables or on the floor or fallen. The corners have nicks on them some of the thin bezels around the buttons have broken off.But then i remove the case from the phone and my  year old Galaxy S looks brand fucking new. People ask if i just upgraded my phone. Although the phone is slow as fuck and freezes and locks up constantly it looks incredible.Id much rather have a slim phone case that protects not only the corners of the phone from breaking if i drop it at the gym or toss it in the corner while im lifting but to protect the back and sides of the phone as well from getting scratched up or any blemishesI also use the WizGear  Car mount for my phone and my tablet so i need a case on to install the metal plate in the back for the magnet to attach toSpigen makes some great stuff.

Camera phones are getting better but its slow and while they have improved over the years they still cant beat a good DSLR or current mirrorless cameras.  If you are looking for a small camera that you can take casual shots with and post them to social media for your friends to see any smart phone camera will work.  If you are serious about photography and want to step up your photo taking game then you need to be looking at an actual camera.   of the time any really good photo you see on instagram was taken with an actual camera and publishing them on instagram is just the last step in a long list of postprocessing.,GalaxyS8,dgij99p,1,t5_2wi4l

11770353,0,t1_dgu6px7,Well the worst part is that when you successfully unlock the phone with the FP sensor there is no vibration at all.  It only does the halfass vibration when the sensor fails to authenticate a registered fingerprint.  So if you arent looking at your screen and use the FP reader you can only tell if authentication failed.  I guess lack of any vibration could be an indicator that you were successful but thats assuming you landed your finger on the sensor correctly enough for it to be detected at all.  A nice success vibration would just be nice.As far as the media volume mute thing I know you can change the volume that the volume buttons control in the Sound and Vibration section of the settings.  You can switch it to media then use the quick settings toggle to toggle your ringernotification volume between onvibratesilent.  ,GalaxyS8,dgu78gy,1,t5_2wi4l
11771175,0,t3_67iqvo,For anyone interested in the Whitestone Dome glassI just received mine today and I am extremely happy about my choice so far. It was slightly complicated to install as the video would suggest but following the video resulted in a pretty much perfect installation for me. There was a tiny bit of excess adhesive at the top of the protector  by the speaker bar but a few scrapes from my finger nail took care of that. Case compatibilityI have the Spigen Neo Hybrid as well as the Olixar XDuo using the Olixar and I actually like it a lot better than the Spigen. I specifically asked Whitestones Amazon front if the Neo Hybrid was compatible assuming that if the one is the Olixar will be as well same basic construction. They assured me that it would be but you need to wait  hours postUV for the adhesive to fully cure before putting on the case. I did that put the Olixar on and loandbehold it fits perfectly. I dont have any uplift whatsoever. I havent tried it with the Neo Hybrid as the Olixar is my daily driver but I can only assume it works.ImpressionsNot the sleekest of protectors out there. The edges of the glass are raised not beveled down like a true .D protector however I barely notice with the case on. However its the first and only as far as I know screen protector that actually works fullcoverage on the S. Because the adhesive is fullcoverage theres no air gaps and no loss of sensitivity. The forcetouch home button works like theres nothing there but the phone itself. My only concern is that the glass is thick enough that if placed facedown the lip from the case may not be enough to prevent the screen from touching whatever surface youre laying it on. That being said since its a tempered glass it should be fine scratchwise apart from sandgranitic dust which would still scratch it regardless of the protector and will protect the phone screen from shattering. Ill be leaving it on so I dont have any indication of how easy it is to take off. But overall if youre clumsy like me and need something a little extra there to prevent your screen from cracking Id highly recommend the whitestone.,GalaxyS8,dguallz,2,t5_2wi4l
