3514466,0,t1_cpstim9,From the same article gtSo if a court can prove that you incite imminent lawlessness by falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater it can convict you. If you incite an unlawful riot your speech is brigaded with illegal action and you will have broken the law. But merely falsely shouting fire does not break the law even if it risks others safety.Thanks for the link. It does help clarify what were discussing. To be more clear if you shout fire in a crowded theater and then absolutely nothing happens or you are laughed at or you are kicked out by management for a nuisance you are not automatically subject to arrest and prosecution because of what might have happened. No criminal behavior resulted from your lie and the First Amendment is irrelevant since youre not being prosecuted.However if you cause a stampede by maliciously deceiving people and then you are prosecuted you will be unable to cite the first Amendment as a valid defense because even the most jarringly incompetent court can prove you incited imminent lawlessness.What happened Brandenburg v. Ohio was the law got more specific about what kind of violent speech was protected. Specifically you can be non specific in you call to action. IE We need to stamp out injustice by force if necessary is okay and protected speech but Theres Judge Smith hes a commie! Lets kill him! is not protected.And tangential to these the poor people you deceived have a pretty strong excuse defense against being held at fault for the people that got hurt in the stampede. They were under the influence of extreme provocaction which is often successfully used to excuse someone from any prosecution for wrongdoing without saying that what they did was lawful.It sounded like you were saying that you have the right to shout fire in a crowded theater regardless of outcome and that the First Amendment was an adequate defense to legally protect you from any consequences of your public speech. If you did get people hurt the First Amendment would be an inadequate defense for that behavior. the court can punish you for that behavior if it caused lawlessness.Edits clarity and corrections,Christians,cpsvi14,1,t5_2qk5n

6443016,0,t3_40bbzg,So as a Catholic Theologian OK well Im still in college but Im close I see problems with this post. The Catholic Faith is misrepresented plus I like to defend my faith so here goesPoint James   NJKVgt What does it profit my brethren if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?  If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food  and one of you says to them Depart in peace be warmed and filled but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body what does it profit?  Thus also faith by itself if it does not have works is dead.Jesus once for all sacrifice on the Cross lets us go to heaven by him and him alone. We are however human beings given free will by our Lord. We are capable of sinning and even if we believe in Christ we can still reject him. I believe that Obama is the president but I reject his politics same thing. If you are truly a man or woman of faith then your faith will manifest in what you do. Do you feed the hungry do you clothe the naked do you pray do you go to church? Those sorts of things. If you spit in the face of poor people can you really call yourself a Christian? If you have not been to church in  years can you really call yourself Christian? You may still believe in God but if you are a complete POS and sin all the time lets say you sin more than you cooperate with Gods grace do you really think youre good?Point We can debate the whole PetrosPetra thing from Matthew  until were blue in the face but thats not what Im here to do.My question is this Do you really think that Our Lord willed that we have a million different churches proclaiming a million different things? Do you think that it is good or helpful to the cause of saving souls that I can just pack up and move to a church that teaches what I want to hear? Religion should not be based on the fast food notion of have it your way. The church is not meant to reflect what you me or Dupree want. The church belongs to God and to God alone. King David when he ruled in Israel had for himself a prime minister a man who held the keys. That is what the Eternal King did for His Church. He gave the keys to a man Peter and Jesus was certainly not ignorant of Jewish history and he had to know the significance of what he was doing.Point gtin the breaking of the bread Jesus is resacrificedWrong wrong absolutely WRONG!The One Eternal Sacrifice of the Cross is represented in an unbloody manner so that the faithful may receive the Body and Blood of Our Lord. This is straight from the Bread of Life discourse in the Gospel of John John John  KJV saysgtJesus said unto them Verily verily I say unto you Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me and I live by the Father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.And in Matthew gt And as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said Take eat this is my body. And he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying Drink ye all of it For this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins.Our Lord is no liar. He means what he says. John  saysgtMany therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said This is an hard saying who can hear it? When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before? It is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life.If He wasnt being literal why did he not say Verily I say unto ye letteth me qualify what I have said. No he does not do this he says that these words are spirit and life.Point gtHail Mary full of grace the Lord is with theeHail is like saying hello. Not problematic I would suspect? She had Our lord in her womb so saying that she is full of Grace and that the Lord is with her should not be a problem right?gtBlessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb JesusI would say it is a pretty high honor to be the mother of Jesus so I think one would agree that she is indeed blessed among women so how is that a problem? Also the fruit of her womb is Jesus so thats no problem right? Plus this line is a direct quote from scripture Luke  KJV says And she spake out with a loud voice and said Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Your banner proclaims Sola Scriptura so you should have zero problem with that.gtHoly Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our deathHoly Mary? God certainly thought so or do you think that he would choose some harlot to be the Mother of Christ? Plus Elizabeth calls her the mother of my Lord. one verse after the above quote from scripture. We want her to pray for us to God the Father. I suppose many of you ask people to pray for you all the time same thing. Now I know that protestants dont believe that those in heaven can hear us when we ask for them to pray for us but that is a topic for another day the point of this post is to show that nothing in the Hail Mary suggests that Catholics worship Mary. NB there are three levels of reverence. Dulia is like a respect or reverence or love. We respect holy people we know or rather because we can see that they are close to the Lord. We give this to the saints Hyperdulia is is like dulia time two. We have a lot of respect a lot of love a lot of reverence because she is the Mother of God she is the person in this world that wasis the closest to God bar none. She is the closest a human can be to God unless that person is also God at the same time the only example of this is Jesus himself. The third is latria which is worship. Worship is due to God and God alone and you all know what worship is so Im not going to sit here and define itPoint Can something impure stand before God? No. When a person dies do you think they still love the things of this world? Do you think that the loving the things of this world part might entail something just a tad sinful? If so then there is your reason for purgatory right there. You go to purgatory to be purged of the love of this world so you can stand before God loving Him and Him alone and loving nothing from this world. Also Matthew   KJV gives us the parable of the wicked servantgtTherefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt. But the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying Pay me that thou owest. And his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying Have patience with me and I will pay thee all. And he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt. So when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord after that he had called him said unto him O thou wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.I bolded the relevant portion. This parable is about forgiving each other but it is also about what happens when we die. When we sin we incur a debt to the Lord. Jesus already paid that debt on the cross but we still sin after we are baptized right? We go to purgatory to pay off the debt we incur by sinning. Jesus makes it possible for us to go to heaven but we still have to do our part.,Christians,czlqwyx,1,t5_2qk5n

I submit to you that there is a substantive difference between following JESUS as a Person and following a strict set of rules.Did you ever realize that all the times Jesus cured someones blindness He used a totally different method? Why is that? Because He knew that if He had done it the same way each time we would have packaged it and made it about the SYSTEM not about the Person.,Christians,d0wxikf,3,t5_2qk5n
6974511,0,t3_4b8g1e,Institutes of the Christian Religion  Book  Chapter . THE PRIMACY OF THE ROMAN SEEPeters presence in Rome unproved while Pauls is beyond doubt  On the sojourn of Peter in RomeBut I do not see that any credit is due to their allegation of Peters occupation of the Roman See. Certain it is that the statement of Eusebius that he presided over it for twentyfive years is easily refuted. For it appears from the first and second chapters of Galatians that he was at Jerusalem about twenty years after the death of Christ and afterwards came to Antioch. How long he remained here is uncertain Gregory counts seven and Eusebius twentyfive years. But from our Saviours death to the end of Neros reign under which they state that he was put to death will be found only thirtyseven years. For our Lord suffered in the eighteenth year of the reign of Tiberius. If you cut off the twenty years during which as Paul testifies Peter dwelt at Jerusalem there will remain at most seventeen years and these must be divided between his two episcopates. If he dwelt long at Antioch his See at Rome must have been of short duration. This we may demonstrate still more clearly. Paul wrote to the Romans while he was on his journey to Jerusalem where he was apprehended and conveyed to Rome Rom.   . It is therefore probable that this letter was written four years before his arrival at Rome. Still there is no mention of Peter as there certainly would have been if he had been ruling that church. Nay in the end of the Epistles where he enumerates a long list of individuals whom he orders to be saluted and in which it may be supposed he includes all who were known to him he says nothing at all of Peter. To men of sound judgement there is no need here of a long and subtle demonstration the nature of the case itself and the whole subject of the Epistle proclaim that he ought not to have passed over Peter if he had been at Rome. Slender and inconclusive evidencePaul is afterwards conveyed as a prisoner to Rome. Luke relates that he was received by the brethren but says nothing of Peter. From Rome he writes to many churches. He even sends salutations from certain individuals but does not by a single word intimate that Peter was then there. Who pray will believe that he would have said nothing of him if he had been present? Nay in the Epistle to the Philippians after saying that he had no one who cared for the work of the Lord so faithfully as Timothy he complains that all seek their owns Phil.  . And to Timothy he makes the more grievous complaint that no man was present at his first defence that all men forsook him  Tim.  . Where then was Peter? If they say that he was at Rome how disgraceful the charge which Paul brings against him of being a deserter of the Gospel! For he is speaking of believers since he adds The Lord lay it not to their charge. At what time therefore and how long did Peter hold that See? The uniform opinion of authors is that he governed that church until his death. But these authors are not agreed as to who was his successor. Some say Linus others Clement. And they relate many absurd fables concerning a discussion between him and Simon Magus. Nor does Augustine when treating of superstition disguise the fact that owing to an opinion rashly entertained it had become customary at Rome to fast on the day on which Peter carried away the palm from Simon Magus August. ad Januar. Ep. .In short the affairs of that period are so involved from the variety of opinions that credit is not to be given rashly to any thing we read concerning it. And yet from this agreement of authors I do not dispute that he died there but that he was bishop particularly for a long period I cannot believe. I do not however attach much importance to the point since Paul testifies that the apostleship of Peter pertained especially to the Jews but his own specially to us. Therefore in order that that compact which they made between themselves nay that the arrangement of the Holy Spirit may be firmly established among us we ought to pay more regard to the apostleship of Paul than to that of Peter since the Holy Spirit in allotting them different provinces destined Peter for the Jews and Paul for us. Let the Romanists therefore seek their primacy somewhere else than in the word of God which gives not the least foundation for it.,Christians,d16wcm4,4,t5_2qk5n

Why is it written not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ?Php   And be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith Galatians   For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.    But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for The just shall live by faith.    And the law is not of faith but The man that doeth them shall live in them.gt without righteous works my faith is dead.Romans   For if Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before God.    For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness.The Cathodox interpretation of James  contradicts other scripture. James is speaking of how true faith will absolutely and necessarily yield the fruits of obedience and the works of righteousness. If a person says he has faith but he gives no outward evidence of that faith through righteous works his faith will not justify him. Dead faith a faith that does not bear good works is not an alive faith that justifies. Remember also that God has ordained our good works see verse  below.Ephesians   For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God    Not of works lest any man should boast.    For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.,Christians,d177jin,1,t5_2qk5n

7486796,0,t3_4hx6ur,The denial of original sin is known as Pelagianism a heresy condemned by both Protestants and Catholics for nearly  centuries. I would be very cautious with Skelly as he seems to think he has uncovered some grand conspiracy being taught in churches. The fact is that the denial of original sin has been addressed throughout the ages. Biblically speaking Ephesians  is very clear that all of mankind are by nature children of wrath without the saving grace of God. Romans  is even clearer. Jonathan Edwards dealt with original sin in great detail in this work If youre serious about studying the topic on all sides this is a must read.As to the other claimsgtIf a person is given the nature of sin at birth then it follows that man cant be condemned for sin because it is not his fault and that God is inherently evil for creating human beings just so that they can go to hell.Man wasnt given a sin nature. Sin entered the human race through Adams fall as Romans  states. God created Adam and Eve in a righteous state. Adam and Eve chose to disobey God of their own will and sin and death came. God didnt create humans just so they can go to hell. While God could have justly left us in our sin He mercifully sent His only Son to die for our sins.Also the fact that we can see that death has entered the world is really the death blow to the argument against original sin. Romans  explains that both death and sin spread to all men. To deny original sin is to accept one half of the Bibles teaching about mans fall but reject the other. But the Bible teaches clearly that the reason we die is because of the curse of sin.gt It also follows that all babies that are aborted or die early ALSO go to hell.Actually it really doesnt. The Bible does not tell us clearly what happens to dying infants. What the Bible says is that the wages of sin is death. There is a difference between being born with a sin nature and committing sin. My best take on this issue is that all dying infants are saved either because they have committed no sin or because God has saved them. There is a lot of mystery here that we just cannot know. There are some verses that uofskiesandseas provided which may give us hints about this. What we can know is that God is a merciful God and can save anyone he desires to save. That infants are saved is the predominant view held by Christians.Below Ive also posted a short summary from Got QuestionsAll people inherited sin from Adam and Eve specifically from Adam. Sin is described in the Bible as transgression of the law of God  John  and rebellion against God Deuteronomy  Joshua . Genesis  describes Adam and Eves rebellion against God and His command. Because of Adam and Eves disobedience sin has been an inheritance for all of their descendants. Romans  tells us that through Adam sin entered the world and so death was passed on to all men because all have sinned. This passedon sin is known as inherited sin. Just as we inherit physical characteristics from our parents we inherit our sinful nature from Adam. Adam and Eve were made in the image and likeness of God Genesis  . However we are also in the image and likeness of Adam Genesis . When Adam fell into sin the result was every one of his descendants also being infected with sin. David lamented this fact in one of his Psalms Surely I was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me Psalm . This does not mean that his mother bore him illegitimately rather his mother had inherited a sin nature from her parents and they from their parents and so on. David inherited sin from his parents just as we all do. Even if we live the best life possible we are still sinners as a result of inherited sin.Being born sinners results in the fact that we all sin. Notice the progression in Romans  sin entered the world through Adam death follows sin death comes to all people all people sin because they inherit sin from Adam. Because all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God Romans  we need a perfect sinless sacrifice to wash away our sin something we are powerless to do on our own. Thankfully Jesus Christ is the Savior from sin! Our sin has been crucified on the cross of Jesus and now in Him we have redemption through His blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace Ephesians . God in His infinite wisdom has provided the remedy for the sin we inherit and that remedy is available to everyone Therefore my brothers I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you Acts .Source,Christians,d2t7i7j,5,t5_2qk5n

8323838,0,t3_4tilz6,It sort of depends on what hes doing.If he wants to preach a sermon on I dunno undeserving people and he writes the sermon and then goes to the bible to find some verses to prop that up  and finds one kinda close but even closer in another translation so he jumps around  that is a problem.If hes working from the text and sees an idea in there that does not violate the text and the nuance is brought out more clearly in another translation so he jumps around  thats ok. Would I prefer he use a translation and show us in the sermon how he got to his point? Absolutely. But its ok to do this.The first is eisegesis. It is having an idea and then reading that idea into the Bible making the message shape the Scripture rather than the other way around and is a very dangerous practice.The second way is exegesis  which lets the text give up the ideas that it contains  and using these ideas to shape the message. This is the legitimate means to craft a sermon. Once youre convinced that you have what Scripture is saying theres some freedom in how you present that.

And in that group we have we freely talk about our personal struggles encourage one another pray for one another even rebuke one another. Thank God we can have pieces of this in reddit.You know we cant actually make ourselves pure. That is the work of the Holy Spirit. As we are washed by the blood of the Messiah we are continuously transformed from glory to glory. Having this set of rules to follow to keep us pure is the letter that kills in  Corinthians chapter . But the Spirit of the Lord gives life. It is his Spirit that makes us competent. cant cite a part of Cor  got to be read as a whole I testify to that. Ive done so much horrible things in my life. And I even hated God for not allowing such sins while allowing the desire for it. However I surrendered to the Lord. He is God. And I know theres nothing I can do about that. Not that I was pushed to follow but as I surrendered to Him it is He who will let me be able to follow too. Titus  gtFor the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all men. It instructs us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and to live sensible upright and godly lives in the present age as we await the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession zealous for good deeds.The grace of God works in us. We know we cant live righteously as weve been under enslaving impure spirits when we were still living on our own ways but as we depend on the Spirit of the Lord we shall be set free by Him too  Corinthians gtNow the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom. And we who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory which comes from the Lord who is the Spirit. The Groom is preparing His wife for Himself. And He died for this. He has died for our sins that we might have His righteousness. He died that we may be washed off from our unrighteousness. But by this worlds standard were now judging ourselves and others? Jesus released us from the condemnation. But how can we not be condemned if we will continuously live in sin? Well that can only happen if we dont take up the robe of righteousness God is giving us like Isaiah. Isaiah gtI will rejoice greatly in the LORD My soul will exult in my God For He has clothed me with garments of salvation He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.Therefore if we know that our righteousness are not based on our own robes or records but by Jesus robe of righteousness then how much of a delight it is to live right and pure! But wait theres even forgiveness if we werent able to do so. Dont be so burdened. gtHe says Be still and know that I am God...Psalms  reminds us who He is. Our own capabilities will never do. No matter how hard you study or how much you try to keep away from sin it cannot bring us to the standard of God. But whatever level of difficulty it is youre struggling with you can always put your hope in the LORD whose purpose always prevails. God bless you. ,Christians,d6nh6bi,3,t5_2qk5n

9797601,0,t3_5fcz0m,  As a current Environmental Engineering Student who has studied the topic extensively and looked at the evidence my stance is that Climate Change is a real and man made issue that is a real threat to our society. To explain simply why I believe in it there is clear evidence and it is agreed upon by the international community. The International Panel on Climate Change puts out a report every few years on the state of the climate and evidence that it is changing. I have linked to the page you can download the report here Now someone might think while clearly this is a biased source and it is just a hoax made to try to control the economy etc. To that I say the authors of this paper come from all over the world from many different countries and have collected data from a wide range of sources. It is impossible for this to be a hoax there are to many people involved for someone not to have come clean if it werent real or the results were falsified or it was not caused my the actions of humanity and to be honest climate change is not convenient for anyone. It complicates life for everyone and will not be an easy change to make so who would benefit from making it up? To sum it up it has been proven that carbon dioxide methane and other gases from the burning of fossil fuels act as green house gases they trap heat. Mythbusters did a small experiment on this and I have linked the video here We have seen before that burning coal and other non renewable fuel sources has caused problems like smog and acid rain and we found ways to resolve these issues. Why is climate change any different? We have seen photos showing the polar ice caps have been melting we have temperature data showing the average global temperature is going up just because the temperatures in your local region do not reflect this does not disprove this we are looking at global temperatures we have seen odd shifts in weather patterns i.e. drought in California droughts then massive floods in Texas etc.   Now to talk about the Christian aspect of this. I am a Christian I believe that the Bible is the Holy Word of God and that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died on the cross for the sins of all of mankind and rose three days later from the dead. I do not see what being a Christian has to do with believing in or not believing in Climate Change. Yes God is in control and he created the Earth but when we sinned we changed things we corrupted the perfect world that he made. We have seen humanity ruin its environment time and time again due to deforestation and extinction of many species. The only difference about climate change is that it is a global issue and that is why it is so important and so many people talk about it. If sea levels rise many people especially on islands may lose their homes and it will negatively effect all of humanity negatively. God has given us the ability to make our own decisions and we must accept the consequences of our actions. It is not against Christianity to see a problem like this and take steps to fix it. I apologize for the wall of text but it is an issue I am very passionate about. I urge you to look at the evidence and pray about it to see that you dont have to deny science to believe in God.TLDR I am a Christian but believe Climate Change is a real man made issue. Look at the links and evidence for yourself and pray about it.,Christians,dakrl4s,2,t5_2qk5n

11734167,0,t3_67f1zi,Well you can also explain that the unequally yoked thing was more referring to marriage not dating.  But I understand her thinking.  She is worried about getting to involved with someone who will take her away from God which is a real concern that is justifiable.  Just make it clear that you arent looking to interfere with her relationship with God and are open to pursuing your own relationship with God.  Depending on the type of Christian she is her moral standards might be something really important to her.  If she wants to wait until marriage before being intimate with a man then that is something you must respect.  That is a source of a lot of fear for Christian young women that a boyfriend will pressure them into doing something they dont want to.  So you need to also make it clear that if she wants to wait until marriage to be intimate that is something you will respect and even help fight for.  Just let her know how you feel and that you fully respect her relationship with God and dont want to ever come in the way of that and are even open to pursuing your own relationship with God. Edit I liked the late Roger Eberts stance on God.  He wasnt a Christian and more of an agnostic.  He said the problem with atheism is that it puts too much certainty on knowing the unknowable.  An atheist cant prove God doesnt exist anymore than a Christian can scientifically prove he does exist at least by our current understanding of science anyway.  That has always been my problem with atheism is how can you proclaim to be so sure of something you have absolutely no way of proving is true.  In that sense it takes just as much faith to be an atheist as it does to be a Christian. ,Christians,dgq3iwy,5,t5_2qk5n
