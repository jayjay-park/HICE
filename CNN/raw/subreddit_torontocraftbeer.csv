4333349,0,t1_cse2jfu,Im really happy to see a nonIPA as well. Im trying to think of breweries that started off with something other than a Blonde Pale Ale IPA that have opened up lately and all that really come to mind are Muddy York and Clifford with their Porters and the Stouffville Brewing Co. one thats Red Falcon Ale. I wanted to try it so I bought one can from TBS and it was fairly...average. Im sure its way better fresh. I really need to  get to MY though. ,torontocraftbeer,cse3j2x,2,t5_32t1p

5409090,0,t3_3p4fpw,Tried the New Glass app and it didnt have any of the Canadian craft breweries that I searched for.

6712478,0,t3_47k8zz,More space lower prices.At some places it was like  per pint x amount of tokens for whatever  value and brewery charges x tokens per sample. They oughta just disregard the token system entirely if breweries are charging  or more for a  oz sample.  Shitty service. You gave me the Berliner Weiss. I asked for the Doppelbock. Whats the difference? Really?  At least have people who know about beer pouring it.It was a complete shitshow was it not?,torontocraftbeer,d0dmm1d,7,t5_32t1p
7290376,0,t1_d26tj12,Oh I agree with that. Frankly not a fan of the Burdock Brett Lime...its kind of bland...which I expected more. The Bellwoods thoughoh god it is the perfect beer for warm weather.
