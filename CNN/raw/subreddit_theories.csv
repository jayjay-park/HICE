2746500,0,t1_cn8b39s,thank you for actually contributing some thought into it.the problem with saying that the universe is virtual is that we dont know for what purpose it would be created and to what length the creators have gone to to stop us realising it is in fact virtual.We would also not know whether the simulation is still being monitored of if it has been left to fulfil its purpose.I would suggest if I were to create a simulation of this kind that it would take far to much time to properly monitor it unless a intelligent agent AI system were used to do it for them.And i do not believe that our conciousness would be a procedure of some sort but rather the interaction created through the various combinations of atoms that make us up.Thank you for correcting me on the theory thing I should have known better. ,theories,cng9kkf,1,t5_2ryra
