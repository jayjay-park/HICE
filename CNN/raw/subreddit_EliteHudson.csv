4786142,0,t3_3gf4ae,This is my current PvP build. I call it the Clipper Killer.I find fixed multicannons to be a very unique and effective albeit difficult to use choice for PvP engagements. The lower energy consumption of the multicannons mean I can usually operate with at least  pips to shields throughout the engagement greatly increasing survivability. I only send more pips to weapons if I need to recharge my Plasma Acc.The dual chaff allows you to fire the second launcher shortly after the first one has stopped. Ultimately this allows for a near continuous spray of chaff rendering gimballed weapons all but useless for a great deal of time. Hence the name clipper killer.The A plasma ACC is just loads of fun and rips through shields like nothing else providing you can hit your target.I first started using this build as a bit of a novelty but quickly realised that it kicked ass for PvP engagements against other large ships Namely Clippers Pythons and other FDLs. I havent lost a single  on  engagement against these three ship types in this build. Against smaller ships this build is pretty crap. I just run away from those. I realise that this build has a very singular purpose killing large ships but so far Ive really enjoyed using it. I love watching my enemies pop chaff not knowing that it does nothing!,EliteHudson,ctxtzap,1,t5_38fij

If possible coordinate with Winters and have them target a different faction.I would also request that every CMDR fortify at least  supplies this week.

Corri got exactly what he wanted  which was to get as many noncommunity Alliance players as possible into going to war against Kumo plus the subsequent outrage from Alliance leaders in which they were forced to admit publicly that the Alliance is actually in a rather OOC friendly agreement with slaving pirates. Amidst the outcry FD finally twigged that rubberstamping Corri may not be the wisest policy and in apology then published a counterarticle.

There were a couple ignorance preps in previous cycle but something like LP  is so far away from Nanomam and Hudson space in general as well as so strategically terrible to both Hudson and Winders that there is no question about this being prepped by people who are actively trying to have a negative impact on both powers healths as a whole. Combine this with the relatively large amount of effort thrown into getting it as high on the prep list as possible and you have one of the few scenarios where a fifth column is actually far and away the most likely explanation.

6286309,0,t3_41ps1w,I know the feeling. But I have learned between adding some exploration hobbies and keeping up BH Res runs for income I just aim for having fun first.As for Rank  I personally am waiting some until I can fit a fair trading hauler like a T or possibly a larger ship like the conda.  The trouble I see is the mechanic meaning you loose  of your work off every cycle  its disheartening to work up much past the  Rank  to loose it on a week you cant keep up later. I find its easier just to wait till I can maintain it easily than to grind it up every time.The reason for me waiting is I see that Rank  will keep itself just about if you can get a decent hauler of  tons or a bit more as that  mil bonus pays for the k credits to keep Rank . Then its just a simple matter of a number of fortification trips to keep it. The number is a little timeconsuming when your hold is  instead of that nice .For the vulture and travel?

7185923,1,t3_4dvro2,Ill make this rebuttal here since I am still banned from rEliteWinters. Since so much of the post was dedicated to CMDR Driggers Id like to defend him and his efforts for the Federation.At the start of December Driggers left Hudson. He was mocked and derided and personally attacked by the people whom he called friends just the day before.Why? Well he said so here on the Hudson sub and here on the Patreus sub He made a number of predictions that have subsequently been validated.Ill pull some relevant quotesgtIt has not been the grind or the burden of leadership itself but my own conscience that has led me to make this decision. We are becoming the very things we hate about our enemies. Unleashing this recent attack upon the Alliance validates this perspective. Well done.gtWe treasured the bonds we had with the independent powers Sirius and Utopia. Now were treading dangerously close to becoming the same tyrants we accuse the Empire of being by forcing them to adhere to our standards or be destroyed.gtI entertained for a time briefly of defecting to Sirius in the event we went to war with them over AF Leporis. I could not participate in the systematic destruction of an independent power no matter how close they may be to the Empire. Through the understanding and sheer willpower of both the Federation Foreign Service and the diplomats of Sirius Corporation we avoided war  but it still remains at our doorstep. The Federation Winters in particular has repeatedly forced Sirius into turmoil and claimed profitable systems. Good outfitters too. Well done.gtI accepted the ambiguity that we treated the Pegasi Pirate War with because I felt like we faced a bigger threat from the Empire. For a period of time we did. Every week it seemed like they were launching another operation another offensive aimed at us. Every time we drew closer together and weathered the storm. But now I fear weve become the storm. The entirety of civilized space trembles before our might. If you had asked me a few weeks ago I would have taken pride in the fact. But uttering those words I no longer believe that is a good thing. Indeed the Federation is to be feared. Well done.gtThe Federation was meant to embody all of the good that humanity could be if we agreed to cooperate and to live and let live. It was with this in mind that I took on the role as the powers diplomat. It was a responsibility I took a great deal of pride in. But more and more I found myself at odds with the other members of leadership. Ill leave it at that.gtHow long until we turn on our friends in the Alliance? When the profitable systems dry up and the other powers have been bled dry will we go back on our commitment to them? If we are generous and dont include other Federal incursions in Alliance Territory Thursday mornings merit dump was  days from the time Driggers asked this question. Well done.gtI am defecting to the Empire and joining Senator Denton Patreus fleet. It is not because I favor the Empire no more than I favor the Federation in its current form. I believe in the people there. To their credit many people were kind and understanding. However Driggers defection was drew such vitriol in the comments that I was ashamed to even play the same game as the commenters. Personal attacks were excused in the name of RP. Im sorry but role play is no excuse for treating someone abominably. If that type of attitude and behavior is common in the Federation player base I dont think he needed to provide any other reasons for his defection. Did I mention these Imperial Scum Driggers joined were there encouraging the Federation player base during their darkest hours?gtI cant change the Federation from within  but I can try to be an example for those who can.
