Everything about it was amazing at the timebut there was one part where they tried to push a guard off a ledge and he was stuck in the air. Ironically this was the thing that really sold me at e. This glitch showed me this was an actual gameplay occurring and not some cutscenes or trickery. What I do wish is for more developers to release demos that showcase the games mechanics. It does not have to be a level It could even be the a small test room where they test the various mechanics implemented in game. Have a notice there  may be bugs and to  report them if they happen thus leading to player testing helping the patch up. I think a lot of companies really underestimate how much players can and will help developers when they give them the opportunity. Fans would do what they can to improve their franchise and even give feedback for better solutions and would be more attached to the project thus more likely to buy it when the game is finished.,Gaming4Gamers,cez9ual,1,t5_2x2wj

198290,0,t3_1w82mj,As someone who was once interested in playing fighting games competitively all I can say is it depends on what you want out of a fighting game. Do you want a balanced game with good netcode? Are you interested in the single player content? Do you want a game where strategy is key or do you prefer more executiondriven games with nonstop action?Lets look at Soul Calibur for instance. If youre looking to play competitively to any extent  is hands down the best game in the series followed closely by the original for the Dreamcast. Its aside from maybe Viola incredibly well balanced it has several mechanics that discourage both mashing and turtling every character has unique tools that make them very different from each other and the netcode is superb. However its much more fast paced and less masherfriendly than any other game in the series but Id say the condensed movesets and simpler defensive game make it a great start for beginners to D fighters in general. If youd like to learn more WAYRUN is a great place to get started.But I understand that not everyone is looking for competitive play in fighting games. If what youre looking for is a solid single player experience SC will be a disappointment. Beyond the indepth character creation the single player is lacking in many ways so youd probably want to check out SC. Its despised by many in the competitive community for certain broken characters and gamebreaking bugs that ruin competitive play but theres a story mode for each character a ton of challenges and special modes and it even has a JRPGesque side story for your created character. Soul Blade for the PS One a prequel to Calibur  also has a ton of great single player content but the fighting is very outdated by todays standards. As for your question on which games to start with for each series this is how I went about it Street Fighter II The World Warrior SNES Street Fighter Alpha  SNES or Sega Saturn Soul Calibur Dreamcast Tekken  Arcade or PS King of Fighters XIII PSSteam not to be confused with the atrocity that is KoF XII Tatsunoko vs Capcom Wii Virtua Fighter  Final Showdown PSNXBLA EXTREMELY TECHNICAL Dead or Alive  DreamcastPS Mortal Kombat PSEDIT Id also like to add that my favorite fighting games of all time are Soul Calibur V Street Fighter Alpha  and Bloody Roar  the last one isnt that great but I love it because of nostalgia.

356714,0,t3_1y6c6d,There are two that come to mind. Lorule Castle in The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds. Not only does it house some of the best puzzles in the entire game and not only is it actually quite challenging and not only does it really quiz you on your knowledge and abilities youve gained throughout the entire game while never feeling like its just repeating stuff but it has this music playing all the while and as you get further into the dungeon the music gets more and more intense and powerful. Thats freaking brilliant. The Collector Base in Mass Effect . By the way SPOILERS IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED IT BEFORE. People including myself complain about Mass Effect  not actually making your choices throughout the game or throughout the trilogy really matter in the last hours of the game. ME on the other hand did it perfectly. I hate whenever people say the plot to this game was meaninglessit felt so epic and the characters were top notch. But I think the testament to how well the game was developed lies in the final level where youre not just going through all the corridors. The mission starts off with testing you on how well you cared for your ship throughout the gamedid you upgrade it at all? Did you really prep it for the oncoming onslaught knowing that the last Normandy got torn to shreds in a matter of seconds? Later you have to assign squadmates and specialists to different tasks throughout the final mission. In order to command them correctly you have to know their strengths and weaknesses and you have to have gained their loyalty. And its not just a matter of Was this person an engineer or an adept or a vanguard etc.? Wrong! The first time I went through the mission I chose Mordin to work on hacking in a certain area because I thought hed be adequate knowing his abilities were all seemingly engineerbasedhe died. I was an idiot and I didnt pay attention to him. When you direct them to the wrong tasks they may die others may die because of them and you may die at the end as well. When your ship wasnt upgraded properly squadmates can also die because of that. The entire final mission is a culmination of all the gameplay choices you made throughout the rest of the game. I freaking love the effort the devs put into thatit was the last Bioware game I truly enjoyed.,Gaming4Gamers,cfhqn3p,7,t5_2x2wj

424851,0,t1_cfoq38q,Not quite. There are a few of key features that need to be addressed before it comes close to a steam like distribution. Unfortunately such a distribution would can be more damaging if you think about it. It works on the PC platform strictly because there are other places to get games. Amazon GOG and a handful of others. The problem is MS and Sony would most likely be their own online distributions in a hardware locked state. Essentially putting whatever prices they think they can get away with and no competition on their online distribution other than moving to another console. Then it would likely become even increasingly more complicated years down the line when it becomes a question of moving up another platform but this is strictly speculation.This already is the case with apple for example. They are in control of their own hardware OS app store everything. Even according to the fine print the devices the customer purchase themselves. While they have a system that ensures stability and control it also means they have control on the price tag. In a game of dollars and cents at the end of the day a Mac will cost more than a PC will of equal hardware. The recent Mac Pros price tag could make a PC that blew the MPs hardware out of the water. Now before I start sounding antimac my point isnt about a what is a better OS but about what happens when a company gets the chance to control every aspect of the customers areas of potential purchase in a given market. If they have control over everything they will inevitably keep the price as high as they can get away with. It can happen to any company. Not just MS and Sony.Sorry if I got all doom and gloom there. The good news is for now MS learned their audience still will leave if they push too far and Sony learned they will come in droves when they give customers more control over what is rightfully theirs. ,Gaming4Gamers,cfosu8m,2,t5_2x2wj

544965,0,t3_20cwke,Its a game that really rewards a certain mindset and punishes others.Basically this is a game that respects you as a player but demands that you respect it back. The combat itself is wonderfully designed. Its methodical defensive movement based combat that is incredibly technically sound. Its very rare that death is the fault of the game bugging out or bad design. It can seem clunky at first if youre used to fast paced combat but when you get the hang of it its actually quite beautiful to watch and handles great.The difficulty. Ah the difficulty. Let me say this the difficulty is overhyped. Seriously. Dark Souls isnt that difficult. Its incredibly fair. You can beat the whole game without taking a hit of youre skilled enough. But it is obscure. And punishing. Death is usually the result of either not respecting the game or strength of your foe or simply lack of knowledge. Once you acquire that knowledge and stop trying to hack and slash the game opens up and it really isnt that difficult.It rewards a mindset of dedication determination and selfimprovement. Progression is just as much player based as character based. More so maybe. Players who rush into boss fights expecting them to roll over are going to have a bad time. Players who go into fights hoping to stay alive and scout the enemy figure out its patterns and weaknesses then learn to exploit them may die a few times but theyll improve with every death and will get through it just fine.The rush comes from that feeling of achievement. Of seeing yourself grow and improve as a player. Of taking down giant obstacles and fearsome foes that would have destroyed you previously. The players who quit and go hollow are the ones who dont learn to improve. Those that do can break through any barrier the game throws at you.,Gaming4Gamers,cg27wiv,5,t5_2x2wj

Shoehorning in mechanics from other genres shittily imo i might add doesnt feel like evolution to me so much as desperate efforts to remain relevant.The last FPS I enjoyed that wasnt a remake I love CSGO was brink but the console centrist controls and plethora of bugs made sure the game failed.Now I would love for there to be a resurgence of nonlinear FPS.

Admit you were wrong. Want to know how to turn acknowledging you made a mistake into your advantage? Do it before you do a halfassed fix or rerelease for it offline in Sim City BFHardline Diablo III whatever the change was.Finally admitting BF was bad? Good thing Hardline is on its way. Thats a good time to acknowledge that things could have been better and boost user confidence in this product. Granted the majority of people who that would work on will see it in the media pipeline so it wont come off as EA admits they were wrong itll have a positive spin. EA promises Hardline will be the best!. And what if it isnt? Who cares. Youve bought the game publishers sell millions it gets patched out hopefully.

I also like having a long render distance.My major issue with console games though is when the developers decide that the PC market for the same game only needs a really bad port with poor controls.A recent example of PC vs console versions being upsetting is Ubisoft releasing Watch Dogs with the graphics nerfed to what consoles were getting in order to provide a unified experience or whatever marketing excuse they used.Anyway im going to go home and enjoy gaming on my PC.

1795484,0,t3_2f33q5,One thing I think is worth noting and I hope this is on topic is that Ive seen a lot of talk about gaming journalists as well as gaming critics. In particular calling for complete objectivity. I think its important to distinguish between journalists those reporting the news. And critics those whos very job is in fact a subjective one. The gaming media consists of both of these jobs and others. Even the summary here doesnt seem to make much of a distinction.You read a critics review for their opinions. There are no solid objective metrics for rating or reviewing a game. Ideally a critic aims to be consistent in their own opinions and often a news site aims for a degree of consistency among their critics. But these people by definition have a subjective job. Because of that you should take into account their record as far as how much stock you put into it. If youve loved a lot of games theyve tended to review poorly that tells you how valuable their review likely is going to be for you and vice versa.,Gaming4Gamers,ck5gxau,14,t5_2x2wj

1827406,0,t1_ck9dlgq,...against bigotry in gaming. Like weve been discussing. This whole time. And speaking up against bigotry and supporting diversity in games is what we can do. I assume you would report a crime if you saw one and speaking up and saying I support diversity is pretty much the equivalent in that analogy. I never said we could completely eradicate bigotry I said we could speak up against it and bring it down to a level where its something you just shake your head at instead of something that happens so frequently. Did you not read the part where it said that women over  are the fastest growing demographic? And that women outweigh young men in the statistics? You were trying to say that women arent significant buyers in games and I showed you statistics to prove you wrong. Now show me statistics that prove you are right. What were you trying to say with women and buying games with strong female characters then? It sounded like you were arguing that women werent buying enough games to be taken seriously by publishers and they obviously are. They also buy games with female leads but for some reason the industry is lagging behind. Then I showed you an article about how games with female leads dont receive as much funding for marketing which might explain why most of them dont sell as well as malecentric games. What about that? I never said that there are no games with strong female leads only that there are too few. When games like Tomb Raider and Mirrors Edge are held up as exceptional due to the gender of their protagonist thats a problem because it means there are too few of those games.Why do you have a problem seeing a female maybe nongamer defending a female gamers interest not that Anita has ever claimed to do that? Especially when so many agree with her? She got a ton of funding for her series and the episodes are generally well received by developers and many of the female gamers I speak to online.

The fact is that she already had a bias against video games and everything that she does is meant to reinforce that preexisting view that they are sexist.I think the not a gamer quote is relevant. It shows that she never intended for her videos to be a fair objective examination of video games. The fact that she automatically assumes that for her to enjoy games she has to enjoy shooting and ripping peoples heads off shows just how ignorant she was about gaming in general when she set out on her hunt.Thats why a lot of her points end up missing the mark.gthow do I NOT do that?

This to me is the most damaging thing that she does... shes wrongly skewing the view of future game devs when it comes to sexuality.You are allowed to make female characters and youre allowed to highlight their feminine qualities. There is nothing wrong with either gender. There is nothing wrong with sexuality or celebrating either gender. Id argue that focusing too much on sexuality can potentially be selling out but only if it compromises your actual vision.gtwhile I like the identification of a problem the solution is never addressedYes. Another great point. The fact is that she doesnt have any solutions or really any deeper insight into the actual reason why there exists the level of sexualization of women in video games. She just wants to complain about what she perceives as a problem and people are more than happy to give her money for voicing those complaints.,Gaming4Gamers,ckauvqb,1,t5_2x2wj

For example Bad Streamlining cuts unnecessary features in order to make the game simpler to both create and consumem while keeping others the same resulting in a shallower game all around.The second type usually comes from Time or Budget constraints not from a genuine belief that it will improve the game.Of course many games have aspects of both. ,Gaming4Gamers,ckdvgzk,2,t5_2x2wj

So Ill pick  of my favorites that probably wont be mentioned here otherwise Analogue A Hate Story  This game opened up my eyes to the possibilities a well written visual novel has for storytelling and world building Shadow of the Colossus  Great mechanics with a great feel to it a story told subtly and the contrast between the lonely landscape and the awesome colossus fights both superbly supported by the awesome soundtrack make this game one of the best to me although the controls are a bit weird I have only played the PS version Metroid Zero Mission  Super Metroid is probably slightly better but I played this much more. I simply love Metroid games especially the D ones. I hope Nintendo will ever make a new one or at least a D Metroid that is on par with the first Prime gameSorry if that was a bit to wordy somehow I felt like I should explain these a bit.,Gaming4Gamers,ckeao1a,2,t5_2x2wj

1871051,0,t3_2fzrfn,Its so hard to pick a favorite. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is easily one of my favorites. But there is a huge nostalgia factor at play there. I got that and a TV for Christmas the year it came out and it was just a magical experience all around for me as an yearold boy. The menu select music and opening scene still give me chills.There are a lot of people saying Morrowind here and Im inclined to agree that its a favorite for a lot of the reasons people are saying.Another great game is Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn. Its the pinnacle in my mind of DampDbased RPGs. Mass Effect  is my favorite game of last gen. Its amazing and I love it.Donkey Kong Country  is my favorite SNES game. Just an amazing atmospheric platformer. The simple controls and few powerups meant you spent all your time learning to master the controls and focusing on the actual platforming. Papers Please is up there too because of the way it seamlessly integrates story and gameplay. Its a perfect game in my book and one I think everyone should play.Fire Emblem Awakening is probably my favorite game so far of this generation. An amazingly deep tactical RPG with cool features that presents a great challenge. And a diverse lovable cast of characters makes it into my favorite list.Last but not least I want to give an honorable mention to all the D Mario games with the exception of Sunshine which I never played. Mario  Galaxy  and  and D World are all amazing tight D platformers. Other honorable mentions Pikmin  Skyward Sword A Link Between Worlds Links Awakening Pokemon Blue Everquest Icewind Dale II Guild Wars  StarCraft  Civilization  Crusader Kings II Final Fantasy  Final Fantasy Tactics Wind Waker HD Skyrim Fallout  Fallout New Vegas and Red Dead Redemption. Edit more honorable mentions include Metroid Prime Super Metroid EarthBound Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros. .,Gaming4Gamers,ckenl7b,2,t5_2x2wj

1887433,0,t3_2g72kb,Dragons Nest and Elsword are both really good Korean style FPs where theres a more open area you travel around and the dungeons are gated off into different areas where you can choose the difficulty of the enemies inside.  It flows a lot differently than western MMOs but I find them highly enjoyable mostly because they have some pretty cool branching class systems.In Dragons Nest you pick from one of seven classes who are actually predefined characters with their own storylines and once you hit level  you pick from two different branches then pick from two more once you hit level .  For instance if you play a Warrior your first choice is between the Swordsman and Mercenary branches the Swordsman hits harder and the Mercenary has more armor and can break through enemies defense a bit easier.  Then once you hit level  if you picked Mercenary youd have the choice between Barbarian or Destroyer if you chose Swordsman its between Gladiator and Lunar Knight.  Its a lot of fun to try out all the different plays styles within a class and leveling is a fairly quick process so its not too time consuming.Elsword is similar but instead of having two choices that branch again at a later level you have three choices at level  and then the class just upgrades at level .  The later class does have more abilities than the upgraded classes in Dragon Nest though so its a fair tradeoff.,Gaming4Gamers,ckgmlr4,3,t5_2x2wj

Conventional wisdom suggests players look forwards and down more often than they look up. When the game has tall levels which require the player to look up more often it helps to bias players towards looking up. Lowering the crosshair which players unconsciously assume to mean the center of the screen will cause players to unconciously compensate by angle their view slightly higher. You literally HAVE to compensate for the lower crosshair by looking up more if you want to hit targets.,Gaming4Gamers,ckli43a,19,t5_2x2wj

A few courses and new character Toadette. Could be argued it is worked on between shipping and release. Also  pricetag on the DLC while base game was  most new DS games are . Mario Kart Wii U  I wanted to specifically mention the Mercedes Benz DLC. It is free and basically a huge ad for Mercedes Benz. Reminds me of the first or first few? DLC for Gears of War  which provided maps for free catch was the DLC name had sponser in it.. Article then goes into games that are released in Japan much earlier than NA. DLC comes out between these  releases and Nintendo has opted  to let these remain DLC Fire Emblem. One game Fantasy Life came out in Japan  years ago. Game has been remade since then in Japan. US version has some parts from the remade version but DLC from the first version stays DLC. A little scummy.. Last thing is season passes. Hyrule Warriors has season pass  as well as Mario Golf for DS Overall I think Nintendo has done good with DLC.

Not to mention I bought it on the promise of MP and that of course never happened so also bitter about that. Its not a broken game by any means thats not what should dissuade you from buying it.Thats just me though. ,Gaming4Gamers,clg1m96,6,t5_2x2wj

2186206,0,t1_clhp109,gt Elite Dangerous has released several fleshed out betas for their game. And Im willing to bet those werent fleshed out betas when people were paying for them.

2189097,0,t1_cli1nwn,gtThat point is in my favour is it not? Devs for consoles have one standard that everyone will be using. They can put all their time and money into this one standard. They would be squeezing every last drop from it.Yes they are trying to squeeze every drop from it. That doesnt mean that they are doing so effectively yet.gtThis falls under my software argument doesnt it? Theyve reached the power of the hardware now its just developing better techniques for using the hardware?No most of these techniques are entirely dependent on how the software is developed what algorithms are chosen and how those algorithms are implemented. There are all sorts of optimization details that dont fall together in an obvious manner and dont have a catchall good solution. Dealing with these details in the wrong way can make big differences in program performance. Also if they have to develop better techniques for using the hardware then they havent really reached the limit of the hardware.For example if I run matrix multiplication with two slightly different algorithms storage layout in memory one of the algorithms will run much faster than the other even though the activity monitor will say they are both using  cpu. You wouldnt really say that the slow one is using my system to the limit of the hardware because the problem is a poor implementation not bad hardware.gtGoing back to PC and I dont give a flying fuck if youre only talking about consoles. These consoles launched with outdated hardware they wouldnt have to make this choice if Sony and Microsoft actually put decent hardware into them.First Im not trying to argue that the consoles dont have fairly weak hardware. Im talking about implementation tradeoffs one makes when targeting a single device which is why Im not bringing the PC market into this.Second high end graphics dont have infinite power and will ALWAYS make a tradeoff between fidelity and framerate unless the games dont render at high enough fidelity to stress a card. Since devs can target a single device on a console they will try and reach the limits of the card. And they will have to make a choice Do I give myself half the render time along with a decrease in fidelity for a higher fps or do I give myself more render time higher fidelity and a lower fps assuming fps?The only reason this doesnt occur for high end cards in the PC scene is that devs generally arent aiming to beat the highest of the high end cards.gtAnd youre the special snowflake? Youre allowed to just dismiss everyone like that huh?The majority of technical discussion is meaningless or wrong speculation about hardware optimization its pretty much the Dunning Kruger effect in action.gtAnd the same cant be said for consoles? cough BF coughThats pretty much my point that being similar to PC gives no promises on how well a game will run or how well developers will utilize the hardware. Also I dont remember battlefield not utilizing the hardware decently I just though the software was incredibly buggy.,Gaming4Gamers,cli361e,2,t5_2x2wj

The penultimate of a generic fantasy world with generic fantasy monsters. Oh you have demons and vampires? Not impressed.Skyrim was the same for me. While there were certainly some mechanical improvements the fact that they still hadnt adjusted their monster leveling or combat system became more and more unacceptable. While the Norse inspired Nords and slightly less familiar locales were a slight improvement it still just felt like the most boring and most vague fantasy world.Thats the real reason to play Morrowind.

2507864,0,t3_2o9npj,The one thing Id like to see the most would be expansion of the sub into an IRC chatroom. It was mentioned in the poll a month or two ago and I hadnt thought of it before but it sounds like itd be a fantastic idea. I think the much less formal quicker freeform nature of IRC would encourage a bit more discussion on new topics which chatters could then summarize and put into posts on the sub itself increasing the post output of the sub.Im not sure which IRC server would be the best for this sort of thing I only ask that we stay the hell away from Freenode. Many other subreddits have irc rooms there and theyre all absurdly poisonous. As for whats going on currently a lack of user submissions is probably the significant issue. But I dont know how best to improve that. The IRC concept might help a bit translating the quick multiuser discussions into a sort of summarized article which then gives reddit users a bit more meat to chew on and weigh in with their own opinions or to allow deeper discussion from those who are initially participating by IRC.Brackets are fine. I think people just need to see more examples of them being used to get the hang of it. Moderation is great. Keep it up. DownvotesCSS  I like the idea... but I think its not a particularly practical one on reddit unfortunately.

2869613,0,t3_2symnu,Looks pretty rough and that is very worrisome since it is supposed to be released in a week. However I hope the build shown in the videos is truly a much much older build because that sea battle was a bit odd. There was no indicator to show how far your cannons are aiming seems even more arcadey than ACs system but without any of the polish or if the enemy is fighting or running or their strength compared to yours but that might just be a ship type thing and when he was showing the boarding part there wasnt anything going on visually it just showed text and ended. Despite all of that an openworld pirate RPG would be pretty cool if it was even halfway decent. I am worried though since it is made by Topware the devs that made Two Worlds  amp .

2999219,0,t3_2uizi6,My possibly favorite game of all time is the PS JRPG Valkyrie Profile. It has a great story which as JRPGs are wont to do is explained through cutscenes. Sometimes very long cutscenes. Its probably  min to actually start playing the game. Very long unskippable cutscenes. Whenever you get a new character theres a scene describing how they die because youre a valkyrie you pick them up after death. Some of these are heartwrenching beautiful stories.... that Ive already seen multiple times from prior playthroughs and would like to skip to get on with the damn game already. Nope cant! Have to watch! And worst of all because you have to go through dialogue pressing X you cant just get up and go pee or whatever and come back.

3482690,0,t3_304cu1,I started playing last night at pm PST when it unlocked. The character creator is the best of the series so far and I managed to create a pretty funny looking crone of a dude. The combat is undeniably souls  but with a focus on dodging rather than blocking. Theres more enemies to fight at once which gives the combat a more frantic and tense feel than Dark Souls. The health mechanics are more akin to Demons Souls where you could amass a large quantity of a consumable rather than rely on your fixed number of estus flasks. I cant wait to get home after work today and continue to play. I havent figured out where to go yet but Im having a blast learning the enemies attacks and the fast dodge animations of the player. Im still getting used to the range of the weapons I chose the canewhip and Im generally just exploring around to get a sense of direction in the first area.Shameless plug of my twitch stream from last night.

As such they want quick turn around of cash which makes for short term gains.For the modder theyre screwed.  The system is ripe with exploitation and their work is undervalued intentionally to make more money for publishers.This is a form of economic dysfunction which will eventually blow up or backlash when people recognize that theyre being ripped off.

4042942,0,t1_crgqbmz,My friends and I had a blast hitting the level cap when it first came out since it has some good customization player generated quests and a fantastic combat system comparable to TERA as someone else pointed out. Being fans of the books helped a lot since Cryptic did a good job of nailing some of the settings visually. Theyre going to be getting an Underdark expansion in the nearfuture that crosses paths with Drizzt DoUrdens story and characters like Elminster and MinscBoo have popped up recently. Havent played that content though.If youre looking for a continuation of NWN maybe watch a few gameplay videos to see how youd like this since Neverwinter and the old CRPGs dont have much in common besides the setting lore and some of the stories.As for FP stuff it does pester you every now and then with conveniences which is a shame but all of the content is free iirc. Theres nothing youre locked out of if you dont pay but theyll definitely let you know that you can hit certain progression milestones quicker if you do. ,Gaming4Gamers,crh4k6l,1,t5_2x2wj

4492791,0,t1_cswyoof,The main reasons lots of people hated on it was the game basically was a copy and paste of several aspects of Arkham City. For instance it had mostly the same gadgets and the new additions were either just new spins on old gadgets like the glue grenade or didnt change the gameplay in a meaningful way like the remote claw. Lots of people thought the remote claw and the shock gloves actually made you too powerful and took all the challenge away from fights and predator stuff.Also the open world felt empty in a way the others didnt and even then half of the map was a reskin of Arkham City. Not to mention the Riddler stuff in Origins was a lot more tedious and a lot less interesting than it was in AC.The only redeeming factor lots of people gave it was the story. It was really well written and the VO was incredible. It wasnt Conroy or Hamill which was another reason people were upinarms but their replacements were veteran game actors and really pulled it off IMO.I honestly really liked the game and I think it got more hate than it deserved.

5003636,0,t3_3jg5mx,Personally I think there are three distinct groups not two hardcore core and casual.Hardcore gamers play games very regularly and play to win. They thrive on challenging competitive games and will often play just one or a small handful of games with the goal of being among the best.Core gamers play games very regularly often as much as hardcore gamers though are less concerned with competitive play. Typically core gamers will play a wider range of games than hardcore gamers but to a lower competitive level.Casual gamers play games either infrequently generally on a console or as a means of filling empty time usually on mobile devices. Casual gamers dont generally identify as gamers at all and have little concern for gaming culture  you wont find many of them here.I dont know if this is generally agreed upon or not but most gamers I know can be put into one category fairly easily. Also hardware doesnt matter so much as the way you use it.,Gaming4Gamers,cup4j6l,2,t5_2x2wj

5213271,0,t1_cved8hh,Oh yeah I forgot two things and didnt have enough characters left to edit it into my last comment. First you need to put all your stat points into only Magic  the other stats are pretty much worthless to you. Any strength you need to wear gear you should just try to get from items. Second you need to keep around some reading glasses as it was called back in the day. Basically you wanna hoard all the best Magic items you can find as well as Str and All attributes so you can equip the best Magic items so youll be able to read spell books at a higher level than youd normally be able to. Even though Magic is one of the best stats to have on your regular gear you might prefer to have something like spell levels or spell damage on your staff  plus its better to have a one handed and a shield with Magic since that gives you more sources of Magic and thus potentially a higher end Magic.My next comment will feature advice on how to deal with Diablo.EDIT Another trick in regards to the Guardian spell if youre playing on a high resolution you can spot monsters before you get within their detection range  so you can put down a bunch of Guardians if you spot a really nasty unique and wear him down at least some before you engage. Its a bit exploity though.  Also sometimes especially with teleporting uniques they might go around a corner and stay there for a while which gives you the opportunity to lay down a lot of Guardians that can hit it. ,Gaming4Gamers,cvee4sw,1,t5_2x2wj

5325362,0,t3_3nvsae,I just couldnt get very far in Alien Isolation. Started off very promising  the art is on point and the sound effects are accurate to what youd expect... but there are some MAJOR issues with the sound. I bought it because people seemed enthused by it but there were more flaws than I expected. The main bugbear early on was there were distraction devices but the outcome was random. Now to make this work you need emergent elements. So if something goes wrong you can do something about it if you think quick. Instead it just became very fucking frustrating. One bit I ended up looking at a walkthrough as I failed it so many times  apparently one of the methods I tried should have worked but took  attempts for it to take. Also one of the options was pretty much a haha fuck you. I triggered a thing thought it would incapacitate the hostiles  instead it made a big condensation cloud over my head and caused the hostiles to attack. It did seem to make them less accurate but I couldnt get out as theyd keep shooting until I fucking left the cloud to die. Same went for hidey holes or slightly fucking up certain things  and not all the deaths were quick. If an android attacked there was a mental debate if itd be quicker to reload the game or let myself die. If theres something that wont let you go let me die quick. Not like I ever got enough ammo to take an android down or Id be totally ammoless even if I did win. Certain crafting materials were annoyingly rare  some Id be totally capped out on but couldnt do anything with them so couldnt loot the extras. It just gave a feeling of horrible imbalance. I get some things do need to be rare but I dont think it was handled well. Wouldve liked some more flashbangs or similar to have a more active stealth playstyle. Now for the audio. Worst culprit was the save points. Apparently the devs havent noticed what things sound like when youre not in the same room as them. I get they wanted you to know if there was a savepoint in the vicinity but there were two I spend an embarrassing amount of time to find thanks to the lack of a proper overlay effects on the audio. Even HL sucked less at this. One save point was in a kiosk shop but I was frantically looking for it outside as it didnt sound like it was in the kiosk this thing was shuttered up so youd expect the sound to be somewhat muffled thinking thered be a Death Special inside but no . Other one was in a stairwell  and was apparently  floors away. With NPC voices they attenuated the sound level too much to compensate for a lack of any other audio effects imo  especially noticeable if you have subtitles on. NPCs were like barely audible barely audible LOUD. In a horror game where positional audio would be one of the main ways Im hunting stuff out accuracy of the audio is greatly appreciated and breaks my immersion if its wrong. The thing that made me give up with the damn thing was when the alien dropped on my head. I had the movement tracker out but down the entire corridor there was sod all on it. Put it away as I was in visual range of a savepoint. Apparently there was a vent above me and with ZERO warning the alien dropped on my head and killed me. There was like  or  clangs a flash of its claw and... dead. That save point was a large stealth section away from the last one so I just couldnt be fucked to do it again. ,Gaming4Gamers,cvsdkol,2,t5_2x2wj

We will talk about it. If people turn it into a discussion about what it means to be gay if it is right or wrong etc. I will start pulling a ban hammer out and locking threads.If people want to have a discussion about being gay transgender female furry spanish short fat or the trials and tribulations of an elephantine penis thats their prerogative.Ive been a part of reddit for  years now and over the last year Ive slowly started thinking reddit is no longer the place for me to be.

6792687,0,t3_48ngzq,Some more stuff the article didnt mention The teams were apparently told they werent required to go to the opening ceremony which resulted in the camera focusing on empty seats whenever the teams were announced  On the other hand the cerimony was to start at  and they didnt let anyone in before  meaning the arena was half empty during the opening because people were still getting inside. The original production team KeyTVs only previous LAN experience had been the Nanyang championship which was full of issues too though not this bad. Apparently they were working for free. One person who was hired to be a translator ended up having to direct the entire english broadcast with outdated equipment. The VIP area and the player rest lounge are really just a bunch of cheap tables and chairs. They got cheap Hz Samsung monitors despite being requested to have Hz ones. Valve eventually sent Hz BenQ monitors and then they slapped Samsung stickers on them apparently they had a deal with Samsung or something. The absurdly expensive food which was rumored to cause food poisoning though there was no followup to that rumor I think. The godawful english streams. The damn thing went down at least  times in a single match on the day  of the main event and the stream was going backwards and forwards multiple times. It was so bad that over k people moved from twitch to youtube gaming and then it started sucking over there too. During the Alliance vs Team Liquid match there was some ridiculous sound issues machinegunhelicopter and satangodzilla  because apparently the observer had been playing a custom game Element TD beforehand and that game causes these sound issues if you dont restart the client. At one point they just gave up and started using the chinese stream to cast which still didnt help much. Then on game  there was no sound if you wanted to watch ingame. Twitch staff apparently went to the venue to fix the issues on day  and it ran pretty smoothly for the  games I watched before falling asleep. At one point Synderens mic ran out of batteries live. Delayed matches and long downtimes inbetween there was a match that was delayed for over h. The first best of  series of day  took about  hours to end and there were so many games left to play that the last ones couldnt be watched on the venue as the arena closes at pm. The russian casters were casting without a table.  They misspelled the names and handles of a lot of players. One player mentioned that you can clearly hear the chinese casters during the matches and that the booths arent soundproof. Speaking of the booths theyre causing health problems to some players like EternaLEnVy from Team Secret and heres OG.MoonMeander wearing a mask inside At the end of main event day  the russian production team had no transport to the hotel and had to wait a long time for someone to take them The cameramen worked for almost h and fell asleep at some points in the next day. compLexity player Swindlemelonzz has been ranting a lot about the problems on his twitter if anyone is interested.By this point me and at least half of rdota arent even that interested on the matches being played anymore and just want to know what the next fail is gonna be.,Gaming4Gamers,d0m8nk4,3,t5_2x2wj

6823881,0,t1_d0p82qx,Ill preface by saying that I think Google and Android TV has failed miserably because of how locked down the features were in all the hardware they sold. I think if they had framed it as more of a hobbyist thing and included a bunch of multimedia functions out of the box while leaving it more open it could have potentially done better. It was advertised with exclusive content in mind but no  android device is going to wriggle its way into the established console market without having some fantastic gimmicks and features beyond exclusive software from developers no one has ever heard of.  or even hardware sold with profit in mind for a fully customizable Rokubox with a dedicated Nvidia GPU an active gaming development community the large catalog of the playstore that advertises ALL the multimedia features you would expect would have sounded promising AT THE TIME. I feel like that ship has since sailed as everyone Amazon Google Apple etc has done a pretty shitty job of this for whatever reason and the market is flooded with these locked down devices that are constantly advertising and trying to get you go buy the latest season of bullshit that you dont want. Nowadays you can pick up a raspberry Pi which is framed as above but does not have the android catalog.

The game just needed another month or two of QA before hitting the shelves but they just didnt want to miss that holiday rush. Same thing happened with Unity in . Both titles probably wouldnt have gone down as amazing games but certainly better games had they given them more time.Also back in  when the series was first announced it was meant to be a trilogy. Ubisoft already had back tracked on that when we got Brotherhood and Revelations but the masses didnt seem to mind since the overall quality was still pretty good at least for Brotherhood. Without saying too much the way the game ends was done in a way that was obviously meant to keep the series going. A lot of fans were pretty upset by this.Personally I dont think its the worst.

People were creating de facto currencies and things were getting absolutely insane as some of the currency items would run out and people would stop being able to trade ... etc. Again I dont see the problem.gtmore and more of it being taken by valve for transaction fees Not really. You only pay Valve anything the first time you put real money in. You dont need to pay anything when trading. So the money is given upfront.gtIm tired of Valve monetizing everything they possibly canBut theyre not. Theyre not selling you pieces of DOTA for example instead of selling you the entire game. They make it free to play and you need nothing to complete your gameplay. Everything is completely cosmetic. Im still not sure what your problem is with what Valve is doing in terms of skins its completely cosmetic. It doesnt affect anything in terms of game balance.

8525927,0,t3_4wfp9x,The Last of Us. Trailers for the game caught my interest but at the time I owned an Xbox. Ended up watching a Lets Play when the game released and got hooked on its story. If watching someone else play the game elicited such strong emotional reactions I can only imagine what it must be like to play yourself. Now having never played the game I wear Last of Us shirts and have a JoelEllie metal printed poster on display next John Marston and Spartan John.      Similarly Telltales The Walking Dead game. Didnt know much about them until a Lets Player Im subscribed to started playing. Luckily enough they ended up making the same choices I would have. I bought both seasons of the game then realized Id ruin for me if I played it myself. I stress way too hard over decisions would probably have the timer run out more often than not and feel a constant urge to savescum or revert when something goes south. Decided to continue with the Lets Play and simply allow myself to get drawn into the story.

8562330,0,t1_d6bpamv,I think its possible but the game that is to be adapted needs to fit a certain criteria mainly that it needs to be story driven but not insanely open. Things like Elder Scrolls and Fallout would lose their charm simply because a lot of the appeal is going into the world and just going on an adventure. In a similar vein I fear the day someone actually tries to do a Mass Effect game. Amazing story driven game but a huge part of the appeal was making your choices and seeing the consequences.Weve had a couple video game adaptions that were on the brink of greatness. The first Silent Hill movie could have been amazing. It captured the look and feel of the games perfectly it was just brought down by an awful script and even worse acting. More recently Ratchet and Clank could have been great. They actually used assets from the games hired a lot of the original voice actors. Ultimately they fell short on a few aspects. The humor wasnt quite the same as the games and they didnt do a great job showcasing the weapons. Overall I would say that it was the best video game adaption so far and it came very close to being good.Looking forward Im cautiously optimistic about Assassins Creed. This is a story driven series and could be great on screen. It has a great visual aesthetic and is borderline cinematic to begin with.

However seeing that TotalBiscuit had an absolutely horrendous time and actually ragequit his Twitch stream because the game wouldnt run means it has confirmed what many of us have known for so long stop preordering games wait for the actual release watch the reactions and reviews see if early bugs and crashes are fixed and buy on at a price point youre comfortable with.

I had the same thoughts as you when I first attempted Dark Souls . I had already become so used to games holding my hand and guiding me throughout the entire experience it made Dark Souls seems like some masochistic nightmare. I gave up and shelved the game for a few years until a friend convinced me to give it another go. I still struggled at the beginning but the satisfaction I got from beating that areabosswhich was the first nontutorial area in DS was unmatched by anything.There is something special about the Soulsborne series that no other modern game has even come close to achieving. No other game will give you the same rush as the Soulsborne series will. There is a reason why people say Dark SoulsBloodborne have ruined other games for them. When I tried to get back into Skyrim after playing Dark Souls  it felt so mindless and boring. But as Ive said before the Soulsborne series is not for everyone.

9594729,0,t1_d9vik9k,It used to be a bigger deal but they increased the tick rate to be the same as the competitive mode Hz which is the same as most competitive shooters these days. In non custom  competitive play however if the servers have a really bad connection they may lower it slightly I believe to make it less disjointed but at that point tick rate is really not important and just the latency from ping is higher by many times the maximum tick rate discrepancy. There are however two systems in place that do make it feel a bit more laggy. Favor the shooter and large hit  hurtboxesThe first means that if they see you get hit on their screen even if you see yourself escape on your screen the server will accept as true  their reality meaning you will die. This means its easier to get kills but you too are easily killed. The second are large hit boxes. There are two main large hit boxes that are usually noted hanzos arrows and roadhogs hook. These are accentuated by some characters larger hurt boxes making it seem like you just need to hit near to the opponent to get the two to overlap. Mostly if you play overwatch you have to accept the fact that you will get killed at times you shouldnt but you will also get kills that you probably dont deserve but on your screen will look fair. Really if you have a decent ping and these factors dont collide you shouldnt notice it too often. ,Gaming4Gamers,d9vqvw8,2,t5_2x2wj
9626982,0,t3_5cuzcf,Your story reminded me of my own albeit tragic jrpg experience.When I was in middle school I had a Dreamcast and a gem of a game called Grandia II. I loved Grandia  I vaguely remember playing it for weeks straight spending dozens of hours on the story and turn based? combat system but at some point I somehow lost my save file. I was pretty upset since i lost so much progress and after some mulling it over i decided  Id ask to use the internet so I could print out some gameshark codes then borrow a friends gameshark use some cheats and start over again. Everything went to plan and after another large chunk of time I was caught up to my old save and loving the game until  I got to  a fight ingame I was destined to fail. I remember it taking forever to lose because I made  of my characters max level to speed up the grind. At the end of this fight I think a new act started and unfortuntely at that point unbeknownst to me my save was absolutely fucked i think the rest of the game scaled its difficulty based on my  ridiculously strong party member at this junction. Of course this was new to me too so I wasted way too much time not realizing my game was ruined playing random encounters that were more like bosses instead of realizing i fucked my save and quitting. But damn that really stung as a kid especially since I was invested in the story and i coudnt watch a lets play or whatever.Sorry if this is hard to read I usually dont do more than a few words on mobile,Gaming4Gamers,d9zq24k,6,t5_2x2wj

Immediately started up another go to try and get a different ending I think Ill like it more now that I can skip dialogue Ive heard.Just got to the last section of Ratchet amp Clank  and was enjoying it quite a bit up to this point. I use was because of the stupid design choice to make the player juggle multiple enemies that take a good amount of damage that can call in a onehitKO on you that you cant dodge or escape. Its turned the game from being fun into being an incredibly frustrating slog playing the same sections over and over using tactics I pulled from Google searches. I fear my patience may not carry me through to the end of this one but I did have fun with it while it lasted.Edit Totally forgot I played a ton of Star Wars Battlefront this weekend for the  x XP event. Went from rank  up to  in a couple days and I actually had a lot of fun trying to finish challenges and Jabba contracts.

Unfortunately your submission was removed as it violates Rule gtwe take spam seriously and killing it is practically a sport for me and my team. uDiggDejected is in the lead BTW Im coming for you diggy our mod tools let us know in a short period of time along with the help of user reports if someone is spamming. We will not hesitate to remove your post and ban if you violate reddits rules on self promotion and spamming. What are the rules Throwawayopinions? Where can I find them? Reddit Rules Spam Rules Self Promotion Rules The reddiquetteGolly that looks like a lot of reading for someone with a short attention span like me can you sum it up for me?If more than  of your links are from the same source such as a blog a youtube channel twitter etc. YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE BANNED HERE AND POSSIBLY PERMABANNED FROM REDDITWhat if its not mine but like a friends or I dont make monnies off of it?Doesnt matter.But site x lets me and I worked hard on it!Doesnt. Matter. This is not site x. Why isnt this made very clear on reddit?Because reddit has a lot of problems like every other website. I didnt even know about these rules until later in my moderating. My account was nearly permabanned too because of this. Why are these rules so strict?Ever notice the lack of MTN Dewritos here? Thats because this policy prevents a lot of shilling not to imply this is fool proof but it gets a lot of it out of the way and teaches users to not use reddit as a dumping ground for promoting stuff. The system in essence is supposed to teach you to give before you take. What if Im spamming and I never realized it until now?Delete your old posts that are spammy and try to contribute. With links. not just comments. We count by links mostly. What if a spammer deletes his old posts and keeps it looking like  of his links are not spam?We can still see it. Not the links but the percentages thanks to third party mod tools. Spotting an evader is rather easy. Other mods can also find these folks easily. Anything else I should know?Shilling in the comments is still spamming. We will ban that too. Thanks for reading.

COD or over  years old. Everywhere you look GA its sketchy theres no really verification of key validity and you have to pay for optional insurance on the keys yep thats right if you dont pay a additional fee you are not guaranteed to get a working key and I have been sold a key in the past which didnt work from GA. From a buyers perspective it just feels off at every turn for minimal benefit. on most games once you factor in the two sets of fees you have to pay Guaranteed working key and transaction processing fees its barely worth it.As for ulternatives theres Kinguin which is basically the same thing as GA.

Most people were introduced to the series when Awakening and Fates raised its popularity but Fire Emblem goes as far back as the NES.Heres some things that youd get out of a main Fire Emblem game that isnt in Heroes. Support system. When units fight alongside they unlock a conversation that raises their bonds with each other. This gives them stat boosts when next to each other. Permadeath. When someone gets killed theyre dead for good. So youre encouraged to play carefully and become a better tactician. Awakening and Fates makes this optional with Casual Mode. I have no problem with this and people seeking a challenge can set it to Classic Mode anyway. PromotionCharacter Building. When characters level up enough they can be promoted to an advanced class of their choosing. Because you have options this gives FE replay value when devising character builds and party compositions. Promotions usually reset your character level back to  with stats carried over so its always better to max out to level  so you dont miss out on extra stats.,Gaming4Gamers,dddjerb,2,t5_2x2wj

10967471,0,t1_deb5ux4,gt Its easier to design and develop than a more open game. For example when you railroad the player down a path to the end of the game you have to worry less about any bugs explorative players might find or about how to best tell the player the correct direction to go in to proceed.The least they couldve done is make railroaded path come with interesting level design. Then I would be more forgiving.gt It forces the player to pay attention to the story being told in the way that the developers want to tell it. e.g. muh cinematic gameplayForcing attention rather than inviting it just makes the developers look insecure about their own story. If its good they could trust the players to not hit the Skip Button unless its a replay. Simply forcing the story on the player with contrived sections of minimal control just feels pretty insulting to both the creators themselves and the players who would feel their gaming experience disrupted by this.gt People gobbled them up and continued to pay full price for them. That set a precedent for everyone to cash in on the latest hot game style with minimal effort.Theres quite a few things that I ponder when thinking about this. Like what the audiences thought process is for accepting this sort of trend before.gt Thankfully were starting to move away from the corridor shooter and railroad campaigns even with games like Battlefield and other EA titles like Titanfall  offering much more substantial singleplayer campaigns.I hope thats true. I cant excuse games gimping themselves after already having the potential to be robust and replayable.,Gaming4Gamers,deb7ty6,1,t5_2x2wj

11363604,0,t3_625izu,Finished up Breath of the Wild really wild ride for a game.  I got sucked into the game and the world it presented like no open world game has in years.  Overall Id say its an excellent but flawed game.  Weapon degradation is a tad too fast for my liking especially on the nicer weapons.  Shrines get a bit old after a while.  They start to seem more like little side diversions especially when they take you all of  minutes to complete.  The framerate issues were absolutely maddening at some spots.  For the most part it wasnt an issue but when it was raining in areas with lots of foliage I wanted to pull my hair out.  I even started to get short freezes towards the end of my playthrough.  Additionally I thought the combat could have used a little bit more.  The core system is very simplistic and while you can argue that theres so much you can do with all the runes and what not that doesnt save the melee and bow and arrow combat from being really easy to master and not all that challenging.  The final boss especially suffered from this I think I only got hit maybe twice the entire fight.All that being said those issues only reared their heads sparingly and rarely interfered with my having fun with the game.  The world feels great to explore and it really captures the emergent gameplay elements that help open world games come into their own.  While it definitely has some weaker moments overall the game is a worthy addition to the Zelda franchise and Ill probably revisit it at some point.Now Ive started up Tyranny.  I finish Pillars of Eternity last year and I really enjoyed it so Ive been looking forward to playing Obsidians latest foray into infinity engine style RPGs.  So far its pretty great.  While Ill always be a bigger fan of the class based model rather than the skill based model Ive liked the diversity presented so far and maybe the game will change my mind as I go through.  I like the timing mechanic so far as well as the opening war board section.  Really makes me excited to replay the game down the line.,Gaming4Gamers,dfk1jz2,1,t5_2x2wj
