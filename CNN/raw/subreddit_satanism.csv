The only things Satanism shares with Humanism is the goal of a secularized government and using rationality as the basis for decision making. Thats it. Core to humanism is the belief in distributive justice altruistic morality and building human communities based on objective ethics. This is not Satanic at all. For example a humanist would see human life as objectively valuable to be preserved at all costs. A Satanist would say no the value of life is subjective to the individual and can be measured in terms of productivity creativity and strength of will. And its up to them to defend it.

What is the basis of this belief or...non belief Im cringing. I feel like someone is going to come and slay me for sounding so dumb?Well I can only speak for myself and Im a theistic practitioner so my view is not typically the majority opinion. I believe that when the mythology of each culture is studied patterns arise and each deity that was akin to Satan represents enlightenment. Through ritual and meditation I attempt to get in touch with that essence that could just as easily be called Set Prometheus Apophis Leviathan Phosphorus The Red King The Horned God etc...in order to gain enlightenment strength and to evolve myself as I see fit.gtHow does it differ from other religions?It does not believe in conversion and shouldnt believe in advertisements and marketing. It does not tell people what to do what to think or how to feel but rather says to pursue your own Will and act as you see fit. It wishes to bestow wisdom not create worshippers.gtWhat does it mean to you as an individual?It means quite a bit. It is the only system that echoes my honest beliefs. I did not form my beliefs around Satanism but rather began calling myself a Satanist because it agreed with my perspective.Since I believe Im working with deity it plays a part in most of my moral and ethical decisions. I do not want to reflect badly on these beliefs there has been quite enough if that already. I also dont want to fuck up any results I get by my own ignorance andor arrogance.gtWhat do you think about Christianity over all? please dont be too harsh. Speak your mind but be aware that not all of us are bad apples.  Christianity as Jesus supposedly taught is fine. Its essentially just telling people not to be a dick. Id honestly buy the guy a beer if hed accept. BUT Christianity as an organized religion is absolutely poison to humans. It does nothing but keep people down it intentionally breeds ignorance and convinces people its a virtue. Its the worst thing for human evolution. As a system it is nothing but a plagiarism and perversion of the systems that came before it and has done nothing but harm humanity.

4472016,0,t1_cst71h7,The reason there are two types of Satanism is LaVey made one up after choking down copious amounts of readings and stealings from Ayn Rand Nietzsche Redbeard and more. Anyway Do what thou wilt is from Sir Frances Dashwoods Hellfire Club motto and his club was about as satanic in the real sense as you could be and not get lynched in its time. The club was largely aristocrats whom got together and did satanic rites but as soon as they went home they pretended to be Christians. Crowley adopted the term for Thelema but it has nothing to do with its origin which lies with the first case. I have never heard of a theistic using this term and have only heard it used by people whom identify with Thelema.From a theistic perspective LaVey uses Satan as a prop and it seems pretty silly even when I explain it to other people whom know not a thing else of it. Many folks today whom call themselves LaVeyists display traits similar to Islamic fundamentalists in regard to the way they talk or act. Satanism is this or that and we are the true voice of Satanism etc.. Please.. You arent fooling anyone with a freaking brain in their head. Ive seen your silly speech patterns in every other fascist on the planet.As far as personas... How many of you supposedly real people use your real names in affiliation with Church of Satan? LaVey isnt a real name and Nadramia isnt a real name. Is Gilmore a real name? I dont know... How about Nemo Frost or whatever? As far as I can tell the only person using his real name was Michael Aquino and he left.Moving toward theism.... Theistic Satanists cultivate a direct relationship with Satan and that relationship may be toward a force a being or even a part of themselves that they feel that connection with. It varies somewhat on the abilities of the person... They worship or rather honor this connection and consider this sacred. They are for science inquiry pragmatism and are the way they are through exploration. Most of us probably start as LaVey Satanists and then grow up or we have experiences which skeptical outlooks say shouldnt be possible but nonetheless occur.Without rigid adherence to The Satanic Bible a LaVeyist is an atheist who wears black clothes and devil horns. You are still a sheep if you are a black sheep. Theistic Satanism is the far left of the lefthand path we walk our own way. Satan isnt our master but like our big brother and someone to respect or learn from. But it is a selfguided tour and isnt for those who needs someone to tell them how to be or how to think.,satanism,csudctj,-3,t5_2qqve

Its dogmatic though secular. Youre not wrong in saying that we are atheists but it is more accurate to state that we are ITheists being our own Gods and masters of our own world. The problem that I personally have with the term atheist is that it makes no claims to being able to describe a persons worldview whereas Satanism does.

That is normal. But there is difference between being judgemental and being a hardcore moralist.i dont think theres a shortage of either around the world.even if you intended to narrow your focus to just interfaith conflict youd be overwhelmed with examples no matter where you go. one explanation may be that an overt challenge to ones faith provokes deathrelated anxiety which often manifests as hostility towards the offending subject. theres some research in branch of psychology called terror management theory which supports that. its possible that because of americas diversity deathrelated anxiety escalating into hostility may be more frequentnoticeable but i dont think theres been research to support that.,satanism,d2vwebr,1,t5_2qqve

Someone who lives in Western Kentucky the heart of the Bible Belt where I am from might say so  but the entire thing is definitely done with the intention of putting on an amazing live show. Their use of the Luciferian concepts of humanism in their lyrics is most definitely genuine  but the Satanic Pope and his band of nameless ghouls with the sole mission of heralding the birth of the antichrist is pretty tongueincheek. There are some interviews on YouTube where they address similar questions like this. I think if Im not mistaken one of the band members is an actual Satanist.

If you sat down and explained the way you think to your parents it might be more helpful than youd think.

Real Satanists understand that self preservation is the highest law and being attentionseeking good guy badge white lighters is a good way to become a martyr.Ill go through it point by point gtId call a ban on Muslims a good start but there are plenty of countries that should be on the banned list that are not e.g. Saudi Arabia.Banning Muslims is not freedom of religion its the exact opposite. So modernquill does not support freedom of religion. gt it would serve TST right if someone showed up at one of their events to bring Gods judgment upon the wicked Satanists.It would serve TST right if a lunatic killed on of their members at one of their events. How uncunty. To pretty much everyone who isnt a Satanist theyre all the same. LaVeyan Templars Luciferians theyre all the same. So an attack on one is an attack on all Satanists whether it be through legal action by the government or violent action by a crazy wingnut.  So by not standing up for the rights of other Satanists youre not standing up for your own rights as a Satanist. gtSatanists. Real Satanists understand that self preservation is the highest lawNo True Scotsman. gtNo true Scotsman is a kind of informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample. Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric without reference to any specific objective rule no true Scotsman would do such a thing i.e. those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the groupgtPerson A No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.gtPerson B But my uncle Angus likes sugar with his porridge.gtPerson A Ah yes but no true Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.Continuing gtit would serve TST right if someone showed up at one of their events to bring Gods judgment upon the wicked Satanists... gtbeing attentionseeking good guy badge white lighters is a good way to become a martyr.TSTs actions are are good way to become a martyr and it would serve them right. modernquill is stating that TST members deserve to be killed and should be martyrs. To continue I stated gtStay classy scum.You statedgtIn response to someone making an analogy for them rather killing than be killed.No someone came in out of nowhere saying theyd rather be a Nazi than a Jew. It was the first time Nazis and Jews were mentioned in this thread as far as Im aware. If youre going to sympathize with Nazis which is what this is Im going to tell you to stay classy scum because fuck Nazis and fuck people that think like this. If youre a fucking Nazi sympathizer youre fucking scum. You can take a look at history to maybe get an idea of why I feel this way. Continuing gtIf you like to know more why Satanists hate TST look towards the Satanic panic. You people going out and stirring up Christians is a danger to us all and disregards other peoples need of self preservation.If you think the Satanic panic was a bad thing and not something we should return to then perhaps you should personally thank Lucien Greaves because hes done a hell of a lot of work exposing all the bullshit behind the Satanic panic.

However nothing is black and white there are many other shades of grey as well more than ! which people never seem to notice.What do I mean by this? Well for instance if someone were to pull the ole Well you cant give birth therefore youre not a woman I would say that theres more to women than just giving birth.I could list a few other arguments people use if you wish but Im sure you get the point.

Granted some women are into effeminate men which is completely fine but at the end of the day women are biologically programmed to seek security and safety under the man. This yearning of course varies from person to person. Some seek safety more some less. But its still there nonetheless.

Id like to start researching Setian philosophy as well as when uThreeScarabs it seems very interesting. To be honest I dont really care about labels.

11731920,0,t1_dgp79jo,It feels damn liberating doesnt it? Finally figuring out who you are and suddenly your path becomes clear.Whats interesting about realizing youre a Satanist and studying Satanism is that youre alienating yourself even further from the people around you. Which is a good thing imo because it sort of filters out the brainwashed the ignorant the stupid etc from your life. By filter out I mean you start seeing how stupid some people are and you just drift apart. You dont have to tell them anything about your studies and practices.gteven if Ive yet to meet another satanist irl.Yeah be careful with this.
