9699663,0,t1_da8kxi6,Sure all you need is audacity and the MP studio version of the song.You basically import the song into audacity and split the stereo track into two theres a down arrow next to audio track to the leftAfter that you click on one of the stereo tracks and click on effect in the toolbar and go to equalization.After the equalization menu opens up make sure graphic EQ is selected on the bottom left and drag everything  Hz and below down to . Press Ok.Then youre going to want to invert the same track you just equalized EffectampgtInvert Finally you just need to make BOTH of the tracks mono same place where you split themNot sure why they got downvoted after I made the disclaimer that its obviously not going to be the same as the typical karaoke instrumentals since those were either released by the producer themselves or reproduced from scratch  but whatever. Hope that helps LMK if you get lost.,JonBellion,da8ouwr,1,t5_2yo07
