6500638,0,t3_41ac4m,Time and getting to know the saw. I tend to use my hips on the slide piece.  Like a grinding dancing motion. Everyone gives me shit for it but damn if it doesnt help.  To much forward motion and not enough side motion man. That blade does all the work man just guide gentle. If you square off your first cut it helps too. Whatever send it to burger or sausage man. ,Butchery,czrpqzq,1,t5_2wca5

9295673,0,t1_d8u8m3j,Why does the angle need to be more acute? Id say it just needs to be sharp and honed. If it isnt sharp and you  cant maintain the edge it wont matter if the angle is more acute than your other knives It will be a struggle to work with.I sharpen all my knives to the same angle and hone the same and I trim most things with a boning knife Im right handed..ect. I have yet to work in a shop where everyone has the same technique. Hang in there mate you will get it.,Butchery,d8uakfk,2,t5_2wca5

9670869,0,t3_5d47ud,Very tough work. I worked in a slaughterhouse for many years in ontario.  It is certainly enjoyable but depending on the size of the plant could be dangerous as well.  Live animals especially beef are unpredictable.  You most certainly will learn a lot if it is a smaller plant and you are doing multiple jobs.  Good luck with your choice.  A trial day is a good idea.  Maybe also try worki g a few days at the slaughterhouse on your days off to see how you like it.  Most slaughterhouses are always looking for people.  Harder to find a good retail job. Not a job you want to do for  years,Butchery,da54yfn,1,t5_2wca5

10474052,0,t3_5pw57i,Be sure to look up some hand stretches to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome.  Most people who hold a knife every day have experienced at least a little bit of it.  The thing I do most often is to put your hands together flat as if youre praying level with your shoulders fingers pointed up.  Then push down and really stretch your wrists.  ,Butchery,dcvcbr0,3,t5_2wca5
