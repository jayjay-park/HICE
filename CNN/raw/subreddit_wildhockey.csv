Look at the context this might be one of the strongest conferences of all time. Dallas are th place right now and if they were sent back in time a few years or more damn near any year you want I guaranteed you they are a playoff team easy. Calgary and Edmonton are the only below average teams. Were tied with the Canucks and down just a few points on the Kings.

493796,0,t3_1zqf1i,Pure brusiers should be scratched  scoring lines and one defensive line with offensive upside is simply the best system. Sure you want guys like Nino Cooke and Brod who can generate chances AND be physical. Konopka and Rupp just arent fast enough dont generate pressure and just waste ice time. Its true we could be out on the ice trying to slug people but we could also be out on the ice trying to score. I support having a roughneck on the roster preferably one who can skate but he should scratched a lot. Right now we have a very skill based line up and its been working incredibly. Historically the Wild where a grindy tough team and they fucking sucked. Finally we have some change and we are winning a lot. They basically should be iced in situations like the Ducks or someone goes full Cooke. Sure kick his ass to send a message.

874659,0,t3_244ll0,THIS I found was really helpful in understanding the Game  situation for me. The following comes from a man named Bob Koch who is currently officiating hockey in ColoradoAs a hockey referee I can certainly agree that it was a missed hold. The missed offside was simply the result of the linesman being screened by the body of MacKinnon and he couldnt see the feet of Stastny. It happens more than you think. Its not the fault of the official just one of those parts of the game of hockey.Landeskog should never have been penalized for the snowing of the goalie. The puck was loose and he drove the net. Just before arriving it was covered and he put on the brakes. Had it happened at the start of the period there would have been little snow. That turned out to be an avalanche of snow. There are times in the game management you let things go that should have been one of them.As a side note in Game  the linesman clearly erred when he called an offside on what would have been an empty net goal to put the Avs up . The left skate was clearly on in fact behind the line when the puck finished crossing the line. Instead the Wild scored seconds later to make it  and had a chance to tie it. Had they done so there would have been just as much anger from the other side as Im sure there is in Minny right now.If youve never officiated hockey you have absolutely no idea how difficult it is to try and watch  people at once. A heck of a lot easier from the stands or couch instead of up close and personal with people moving at that speed.,wildhockey,ch3pb45,2,t5_2rp0l

1006708,0,t3_25mv06,Ive gone back and forth on this. On one hand its really hard to turn down a player of Vaneks quality. He wants to come here and the team can afford it in the shortterm. For a team that historically has had problems scoring can they really afford not to get a legit sniper? And obviously hes a former Gopher so that adds additional pressure from the fanbase.On the other hand the core of this team is the youth. If they are to win a Cup within the next several years its going to be because of them. Yes Vanek would be a big boost over the next season or two but what happens when the kids need raises? Are we willing to lose Granlund or Coyle or Nino in  years so that we can have one really great season next year? We dont want to be a flash in the pan team. We want to be sustainable like Detroit or Chicago. Vanek will want a  year deal to end his career on not a  year deal that would be optimal for the team.Teams that win the Cup do so with a core of young players who overachieve on their st and nd tier contracts while surrounded by a collection of solid veteran players. Unlike the Hawks or Pens who drafted the kids first and then signed the big name free agents the Wild did it in reverse. The Wild signed Parise and Suter first and resigned Koivu and then the kids arrived. So in some way the Wild already spent their big name free agent money.Regardless the team is on the precipice of being a legit contender and the wrong move could throw things into flux. Maybe not immediately but within a few seasons at least.In Fletch we trust.,wildhockey,chipy6f,12,t5_2rp0l

I dont want to trade Brodz and there are a lot of guys who could take the c role beyond just Almond. There would be pretty fierce competetion for that spot.

If Harding and Backstrom were healthy they didnt have much of a choice but now hell get  starts in the NHL behind a solid veteran it should be an excellent year for his development. Now Gus gets a lot more starts too which is a good thing. Bryz isnt going anywhwre its doubtful anyone will pick him up no one was interested in him before our tryout offer.

2217806,0,t3_2kixep,Awful game from Kuemper. He just did not look good in the rd. Still no reason to panic hes a young goalie and theyre going to have a bad game here and there. The key is that he bounces back from this.The concern is the PP. Games like this prove why we NEED to get the PP going. We had   minute major penalties that we did nothing with. If we can score even just  ppg there this game goes to OT at least. Getting the PP going has to be priority  going forward.Also I have not been impressed with Vanek so far this season. He hasnt been the scoring threat we envisioned and even besides that he just looks kind of slow out there. He needs to move his feet more. Hopefully he can turn it around.Shitty game but its a long season and well bounce back.

2231827,0,t1_clnif42,Yeah I was kind of wondering that myself.  I think maybe its because of the lack of a High School hockey competitive presence in comparison to Minnesota.

I mean no one wants to live in Milwaukee because it sucks in Milwaukee.  Greenbay is nice but it only really worked out for the Packers because of the whole fan team ownership deal thing that happened... and Madison is a complete and total college town.

Under the sale tab I saw a Mikko Koivu game used stick normally  on sale for  and thought it would look great on my wall. Since I lived downtown I figured Id walk down to the X and see if I can find the stick just to make sure it wasnt falling apart and I wasnt entirely sure I wanted it yet. Well when I got to the X I asked a staff member to let me back in the game used section. We looked through the sticks but the only ones discounted to  on the floor were former players. I wish I knew her name but the employee said she call downstairs and see what they got. While on the phone the employee in the back found one and said shed bring it up to show me. When she got upstairs she showed me this stick game used from the  season and to my surprise signed! She said it was the only signed one she had but I could only buy it online. Normally this stick would be  but I got it for . Needless to say  I pulled my phone out and bought it right there. She said when she got back downstairs my order should be on the screen and shell box it up to be shipped out Monday morning. Thanks to the employees at the Hockey Lodge!  ,wildhockey,cqkbewn,14,t5_2rp0l

Coyle is one of our best players and he is on the rd line does that change your perception of him? No. They are both good players we just have enough depth to make our rd line pretty potent. When Graovac comes back and Coyle can shift to wing the rd will be back in business. They looked awesome the first night! Its a solid line but Coyle really needs to go back to wing to make it click again. Since Graovac went out and Coyle had to shift back to the middle they havent played as well. Coyle really belongs at wing he is a beast whenever he is there and Graovac seems like a young Koivu at center. Big strong bodied playmaker. He had great chemistry with Vanek and Coyle. ,wildhockey,cw5p14g,3,t5_2rp0l

Hopefully the Wild take Russos suggestion when Graovac comes back and move Coyle to the st line right wing and demote Pominville to the third line at least until he finds his fundamental game again. The only thing that worries me about that is having Vanek and Pominville on the same line I dont think theyve shown any chemistry at all and I dont think Graovac is good enough to carry their mistakes. ,wildhockey,cwg1st4,6,t5_2rp0l

All taken first round after Granlund all good NHL players and I only looked at forwards and some are on pace surpass or currently are better players than Granlund.Do you want me to carve you a statue?The players that are surpassing Granlund are wingers. Winger surpass centers in points per game.Granlund is pretty much the best center with ryjo in that particular WEAK draft. In my opinion Granlund is going for C which is bit underwhelming if a draft class has best players capping at C. The total bust rate is nearly  in the draft after Granlund. It was a crap draft. The year before the bust rate was . Coyle is bottom  grinder track unless the production improves greatly. He is a player in the same sense as Fontaine. If you are expecting a  certain franchise forward with a pick on any year past  like I stated in the original well you are a silly dreamer.Also strawman argument WTF... Little too much reddit lately?

5729580,0,t3_3tktdm,on Spurgeon for Hamonic would be a huge steal. I dont understand the logic of declining it from Minnesotas perspective.Spurge is making .m and is an RFA. Hamonic is making .m for the next  years. Even if you were evaluating them as identical in terms of skills which would be very biased in my opinion Hammer being a cut above Spurge. then declining that trade is basically saying We think we can resign Spurgeon for .m or less AAV. Which I think is crazy wishful thinking.I would bet my bottom dollar that Spurgeon is going to go into negotiations with the icetime argument. Hes a toppairing defender now and I would be absolutely astonished if any team got him for under m AAV. . would be a sweetheart discount and more than likely Spurgeon will get m per year. From us or elsewhere. So like I said even if you got the homer glasses on and are calling Spurgeon  Hamonic then by declining that option youre betting you can resign Spurgeon to a really cheap deal. I dont see it happening.From my end Im a huge fan of Hamonic and Spurgeon for that matter. Hes on a Brodin level honestly. Even if you dont believe we need to upgrade our defense this is a unique opportunity. Hamonic wants out and the Wild are a suitable destination. By acquiring him you solve the issue of what to do with Spurgeon assuming he was part of the trade otherwise trade him elsewhere. You also have Suter Brodin Hamonic and Scandella locked up for cheap cheap cheap deals. Its just smart from a cap management perspective.I mean Suter and Brodin are the only defenders I think I wouldnt trade for for Hamonic. It would sting a lot if it were Scandella or Dumba going back but you improve your team when the opportunity presents itself.,wildhockey,cx7b6as,5,t5_2rp0l

6770649,0,t3_48hup9,I really like the idea behind this but I dont necessarily agree with the model that is used. I would have started with onice scoring chances high danger or normal scoring chances when trying to measure expected ice time. This was basically the only stat Yeo talked about other than points and the random  reference... and weve heard it a bunch from Torchetti too. Yeo didnt really care about lowdanger chances for either team he cared about limiting highdanger chances against and creating highdanger chances for  here are the danger areas statistically speaking Yeo and his team had their own way of tracking scoring chances that might not have aligned with this model. Its one of the reasons the Wild are a much better fenwick team than corsi team score adjusted or otherwise and are one of the better expected goal xG teams in the league... They block a lot of shots and really try to keep everything to the perimeter when they are not in the offensive zone.I also think its a little strange to be measuring grit in here  specifically penalty minutes and hits. The Wild have consistently been one of the least penalized teams in the league and one of the teams with the fewest hits under Yeo. So I dont really know how that would correlate with icetime... Also are these stats per  minutes? It also seems like theres some causality issues but Im not really sure.,wildhockey,d0jqfvu,3,t5_2rp0l

6951313,0,t3_4awvqd,Because the Wild didnt have many viable options. They tried the Kuemper experiment and didnt want to be put in another hole this season if he still wasnt ready to start.Goalies signed in free agency in  Thomas Greiss Michal Neuvirth Mike McKenna Jhonas Enroth Richard Bachman Anders Lindback Karri Ramo Matt Hackett Jason LaBarbera Dan Ellis and Jonas Gustavsson. Who of those do you take over Dubnyk?The other option was a trade. But thats another way of expending assets. Is trading a first for Martin Jones and resigning him to a my contract better than keeping your first and resigning the goalie you already have to a .my deal? With the benefit of hindsight sure. But at the time youre talking about burning a pick or two on a young backup vs ponying up some very reasonable money for an average starter. Dubnyks a starting goalie and if you can sign your starter for under a m cap hit you made out great. A  year deal would be ideal but were cap strapped now so lets say Dubnyk gave a k a year savings each year for an additional year of term. So instead of my were at .my. Its not the end of the world.The Wild had been on a goaltending carousel for a while and it needed to stop. Itd be nice if we snagged a top  goalie. But lots of things would be nice.

Yeo had a tendency to ride a horse until it died and that is so blatantly obviously what happened to Suter two years ago in that last playoff series against Chicago. He had nothing left in the tank. I mean look at that play where Suter went back to fetch the puck while we were on the PP and Hossa who had fresher legs despite being old enough to draw social security just blazed past him and took the puck without a by your leave. Suter had no energy to even challenge Hossa. If BB can restrict his minutes to the  minutes per game we actually need him I think hell have an even better season this year.

8705973,0,t1_d6tg8gl,Well GMDR was particularly bad at drafting. Leddy Granlund Phillips Brodin Dumba Tuch JEE and Kunin are GMCFs first rounders. Phillips centered the top line of the Memorial Cup winner in his draft year and was ranked th among NA skaters. He was supposed to be a very solid st round choice but it turns out Huberdeau might have helped his stats considerably. Leddy got traded sure but he was a great pick. CF seems to have learned his lesson from that seeing how he could have made the same potential error in trading away Dumba or Brodin this summer while they are both still young and their ceilings are possibly very high. You can nitpick Granlund but he was supposed to be Finnish Baby Jesus and he really does look amazing on international ice at winger. Tuch and JEE seem to be taking steps Phillips never will. Kunin well have to wait and see on but it was a good pick in my opinion.

Zucker being on the th line is a recipe for failure and I hope Bruce knows this.

9310564,0,t1_d8w059d,I like that keep him out of Chicago theory. Good point throw him away from the Chicago Wolves. Wheres the love button.Gabbys diagnosis on that annual slump seemed to be that weve never had a fourth line to battle for  minutes a night without getting scored on. Its a thin warning that its probably gonna happen again not too many other teams are attempting  scoring lines.I went from thinking Parises cool but fuck why Suter to PariseSuter are good but maybe their mimbo hippie friends like Gilbert are pretty shitty at hockey to K maybe Parises good but maybe all his friends are douchebags and last year there was a little bit of maybe theyre all sassy losers after that secret affair with famous stickboy Adam Oates. But Parise shotblocked in two straight games now Suter played  last game so theyre heroes again.Staying in the old Northwest Division would have meant actual home ice advantage for like four windows in a row. It wasnt concrete to change it at all Detroit wanted back in the East quitters really then some owners went nuclear once the door was open one of the loudest was ours just for a cheaper travel schedule.This Wild team woulda just dummied a division made up of Western Canada  Colorado this decade. Thats those elusive easy regular seasons and the home ice advantage in the playoffs right there. In the end they did not vote no on proposition Throw us to the wolves.I like PariseSuter theyve made a positive impact sure just the moves that have had to be made around them are annoying. Their deals ensure a real budget D I know he has a name but cmon and a minimum wage th line so an annual slump.I like Coyle now sure he was overrated for years but he seems alright now. Id still trade everyone to get Burns back though. The Sharks stuck us with a bottle of All Star Bacardi with glitter and two bottles of Jamesons they fleeced us badly and they were probably only able to because PariseSuter had texted their retirement plans in advance from NJ and Nashville.Burnsy was the soul of the team its been relatively soulless ever since. The kid bought in he got the manbearpig tattoo started the chainsaw he was like the first Wild player who was a Wild player not anything else. Maybe Schultzy. Even Koivus a Lemaire relic from the imitate the Habstrap the NZ era.tldr PariseSuter werent worth losin Burns for but they were worth losin Tom Gilbert for.

10241746,0,t3_5mnpk8,Well Jeff Carter does score on a lot of cleanno screen hard shots with wheels a lot and he does shoot hard but thats about the only one you can kinda fault Kuemper on its his job to know that about Jeff Carter and how could you not. I suspect that he doesnt he actually played Jordie Benn instead of Jamie Benn once in another OTL and so he got sniped on by Jamie Benn.Im not chirpin Darcy but hes known hes gonna be starting against the LA Kings for weeks now and whos been doing their scoring how do you not watch Jeff Carter? Do your homework on the league Kuemperor its not a chirp its a potential avenue to improvement. Thats how Brodeur and Kiprusoff did it they watched as much hockey from opposing teams in advance as they possibly could.  Other than that happy for the point lot of onice afternoons off for a few of them Kuemper played good overall so were lucky to get one point.  Of course Darcy Kuempers post game comments all pass the buck and it was something elses problem again though. Netfront clutter. Kid look in the mirror and no excuses Jeff Carter casually just wung down the wing and sniped one hard right through you.

Personally I kind of want to see Haula at wing again. Bruce did it on Sunday. Losing him at center is a big loss defensively but putting him at wing adds another Zuckeresque speed player essentially. If Mitchell can handle the c and Coyle returns to c things could get interesting. Id like to see that. With Zucker and Granny on  and Haula on at wing  thats a lot of speed at wing.

Its also possible that the real reason is because we normally have to callup an AHL guy to replace him which obviously isnt ideal. The other possibility is that we replace him with Prosser and that this just means that Folin may be considerably better which isnt a surprise to anyone.With that said if you can find evidence that other team stats xGA SAA GAA are drastically different then you may be onto something but that still wouldnt really take into account the fact that the whole team is in a funk right now I doubt that Folin was the one holding the team together.,wildhockey,df1zt8v,9,t5_2rp0l

Theyre giving us all the O zone draws we can take it means they want us shooting from a standstill and we do. But win the O zone draw take it for a skate to open shit up like Karlsson Dumba or Granlund or any of them really can do that but then turn and shoot sometimes.

11723375,0,t1_dgoul3n,Hes unrestricted we have no rights to him anymore.  Also he will be  years old heading into the  season hes not young anymore.  I think if he was going to become a starterquality goalie it would have happened by now.,wildhockey,dgovi39,2,t5_2rp0l

11725029,0,t3_679r4l,All I hope is that Fletcher doesnt say well it was a great season. Lets keep status quo and try again next year. What I want to see are a few changes during the offseason. Not block buster changes simple lower end tweaking. First we need to ditch Kuemper and get an actual backup goalie. Hell try Stalock as full time backup. He earned it. All I know is Kuemps needs to kick rocks. Second let the young guys play. Let Haula walk and put Ek at rd line C full time. Put in Tuch as well. Third absolutely resign Granny and Niederreiter. Lastly try your best not to lose a Dman. Ship off Zucker if you need to. Bonus get Pommers the fuck off of this team. ,wildhockey,dgp29br,-4,t5_2rp0l

11737222,0,t3_67e2hw,gt his giveaways decreased from last year okay by oneThese are the kind of apologetics that drive me insane. The kid made zero progress with what is his undeniable worst behavior and people want to give him mad props for it. There is no excuse for giveaways at net front. Its bad enough when the forwards do it in the offensive zone but Dumbas giveaways lead to a TON of goals against.,wildhockey,dgqfzrc,1,t5_2rp0l
11751621,0,t1_dgs12mv,Spurgeon is good because hes Spurgeon.  Now imagine a Spurgeon that wasnt hard to find on the ice with the young kids at the Little Wild sessions.  When Sprug has to man up on someone over  in front of the net hes out muscled.  That doesnt mean he CANT cover that guy its just WAY harder and not going to be effective coverage for as much of the time.  If Spurgeon was  that wouldnt happen and Sprug would have a tool in his pocket that he doesnt currently have which is the low back crosscheck knocking someone down that Parise gets every  seconds when he is in front of the net by a large D man.So you dont need to be big to be good but its WAY easier to be good if youre big.,wildhockey,dgs2qjq,3,t5_2rp0l
11751705,0,t1_dgs2c2d,This also wasnt the first time Grandlund has struggled in the Playoffs and much of it has to do with the physicality of playoff hockey. ,wildhockey,dgs32vp,0,t5_2rp0l
11764928,0,t3_67sjxt,I really think this series exposed Bruces shortcoming in playoff hockey. We kept trotting the same package out onto the ice and trying to cycle the puck. Against most teams we wouldve tore them up but against a tight checking team we got eaten up and pounded at the blue line. I really think Bruce just falls into the mindset that it usually works so if we keep doing it it will work now. Great for regular season hockey but I really think he needs to find a way to switch gears come post season. ,wildhockey,dgtl1uc,7,t5_2rp0l
