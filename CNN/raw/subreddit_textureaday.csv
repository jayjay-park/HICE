840836,0,t1_cgzr6tv,I could make a lot of textures in a day if I so desired. But Id like to keep up with one per day as is the subreddits idea. I have to confess though the ores are indeed all done so I can have a nice little break before starting with the next batch P,textureaday,cgzuta3,1,t5_30w81

1496921,0,t3_2bbknv,I feel there should be some black in your flowing lava either that or add a bit more contrast between your red and orange. from a distance flowing lava looks like an all orange block. ,textureaday,cj3wwpl,1,t5_30w81
1999998,0,t3_2hn8qt,Hello!This is my first ever attempt at a resource pack so this is something new I am going to try!Please leave any and all criticism you have as it is pretty much necessary for this pack to look decent!The look I am going for this pack is a heavy emphasis on the looks of items while blocks will be more simple. Meant for use in a PvP arena etc.Enjoy!,textureaday,cku76mi,2,t5_30w81
