4589880,0,t1_cszg0ac,I think they need to get Jace out of the show.  I dont think his poor life should be watched by millions.  It is uncomfortable watching this poor kid with all the yelling and screaming he is around and he doesnt have a say in the matter.

4766404,0,t1_ctui2tn,I dont know if youve ever given a young child anything carbonated but it is a bit of a shock and tastes gross to them... at first.  I noticed she drank it without batting an eye.  I bet soda is nothing new for her. Sad. ,teenmom,ctvckhv,3,t5_2uw5s
4834910,0,t3_3gt8tx,. Leah  I feel so bad for Leah and so disappointed in Jeremy that he didnt bother to work things out. I know shes not completely innocent and we dont see their whole marriage just what the show chooses us to see. It just looks to me like she cant handle the stress and I remember last season she seemed really lonely. But this season it looks like she has help and support from friends and family. Her depression and anxiety must make her feel like Corey asking for more time is a major insult plus I have a feeling she knows that giving Corey more time would benefit her and her girls but is too worried about what viewers think. I am thinking of a parallel universe where they go  and everyone will be saying oh she couldnt handle the kids on her own she is a bad mom! I couldnt imagine. Miranda seems to have a good heart but she has no room to talk about Leah. As for the present I am disappointed she already jumped into a new relationship and moved in but I hope her new boyfriend treats her okay. Cant say much for Jeremy with the lifeafterleah pics. That was pretty cold... Kailyn  Ugh... not sure how to feel. She has a lot to learn. I understand she had a bad upbringing and was never shown a healthy relationship. I think Javi is GREAT for staying and working things out. He seems like a total sweetheart and its cringeworthy to see her throw the kids on him while she goes out and has fun with her friends. No wonder he feels like they are more important. Like I said with Leah we dont see their whole relationship. I think the more Javi tries to work things out Kailyn pushes him away because she doesnt want to be a burden. She needs to work out her feelings and stop involving her friends in their problems. Thats the one thing that destroyed mine and my fiances relationship because I listened to my friends advice rather than actually dealing with the actual problem and now that I keep my friendships and relationship separate we are in a much better place. Also how awesome is it that Jo wants to move closer to Isaac? I hope it works out whether Kailyn likes it or not.. Jenelle  I am honestly proud of her compared to how she was years ago. She seems like she is really trying to change for the better but has the shittiest luck and has low selfesteem. I cant stand hers and Nathans relationship though its really toxic and Nathan reminds me so much of my abusive ex. I can go all day about it. I dont think its a good idea for Jenelle to have full custody of Jace. His home is with Barbara and always was and Jenelle needs to understand that. Its painful to see her and Barbara argue in front of him and ask him so..do you still want to live with me and Nathan? Its also sad to see Barbara stopping Jenelle from seeing him every time they argue and I wonder if Jace will grow up thinking its all his fault. . Chelsea  I really am proud of her maturity and its so refreshing to see her storyline amidst all the drama. I honestly think her life wouldnt be different without the show because she already had so much support from her family and friends and its not like they were hurting for money. For most teen moms your friends practically vanish and I hope that theyre genuinely there for her and not just trying to snag some screen time. As for Adam I have an unpopular opinion that at least he is trying to see his kids more and I know she has Aubrees safety and best interests at heart but she and MTV paints him as the worst person to walk the earth and will never change. Yes he should follow the rules more and stop being so stubborn. It was great to see her and the other girl the blonde forgot her name. I just call her blonde Chelsea because they look alike lol to bring Aubree and Paislee together but she was acting sooo shady. I think her and Adam secretly hooked up,teenmom,cu3z9gc,8,t5_2uw5s

6447101,0,t1_czlzlm8,Nothing you said was inaccurate in itself. Where you look ridiculous is how you are applying this information to Catelynn.

Why does no one ask her if she thinks its working? How could it be working when she seems so unhealthy and unhappy? How could it be working when she needs her mother to care for her child for multiple days?gtwell she did admit to taking antidepressants though which makes this all confusing to me. Does that mean she took antidepressants throughout her pregnancy? Who is supervising them? Has she considered that theyre no longer working?Youre pearl clutching over a depressed and anxious woman who is being treated with SSRIs. That she looks unhappy to you on reality TV is not proof that her antidepressants arent working that she took them during pregnancy that they alone made her fat or that she is not currently seeing a doctor.

7060282,0,t1_d1gmggr,Depends on how it went down when he was born. With my son his dad signed a paper in the hospital and his name was put on the BC he has as much rights as I do and even though we were never married I was never the custodial parent because we never went through the courts. I havent seen the episode yet but usually if there was never established custodial rights both parents are equal and can do as they choose with the child. This has become an issue where dad takes off with the kid but just as he cant keep mom from seeing the child moms legally cant deny visitation to dad when there is no established custody agreement. Pretty much if there isnt paperwork saying dad gets him every other weekend and holidays dad can pick the child up at daycare and keep him at his house for  years if he wants. Most guys dont know this though and think its all up to the will of the mother but as soon as a dad keeps the kid an hour longer than mom said shes running to the phone claiming the child was kidnapped.,teenmom,d1gn6gc,3,t5_2uw5s

Hes so manly but yet is passive aggressive and cant seem to sit down or want to sit down and have an adult coversation with Jo and Kail about why hes so upset with them.

This is true with any medication when its new proceed with caution. And this part is more personal I wonder what impact reality television has had on our ability to grow old naturally. If the desire is to live a longer healthier life doesnt it make more sense to work less and eat healthy instead of paying money to a doctor injecting a disease into your face?

Not to mention javi hasnt been the most respectful toward jo either and its pretty obvious that Jo and Vee are not fans of him. I think its kailyn mess and shes got to figure out how to deal with it selflessly. Edit I also want to add that Jo gets no benefit from being buddies with Javi. He and Vee are working on strengthening their relationship with Kailyn right now. Itd be a huge mistake for him to do anything for Javi because we know Kailyn will fight to take time away from Jo plus more child support. This isnt Jos mess and itd be better for him to stay very far away from it and keep things as peaceful as possible with Kail for the sake of their copareting relationship and his precious time with his son. No pressure should be put on Jo at all. I hope Javi has enough respect not to drag Jo into it. ,teenmom,d3io16g,18,t5_2uw5s

7809948,0,t1_d3tn5zv,I agree. She owes us nothing but she owes it to herself amp her three little girls. Shes spending time high as fuck while her disabled daughters peak of mobility is growing smaller amp smaller. No doubt she will feel extreme guilt for that someday. I dont blame Leah. Im an addict amp I dont have to worry about  children  ex husbands ect ect so I feel her pain. I just wish she had turned to something healthy instead. We cant judge if someone is still using or not just based off of a few episodes. You are right. She does look more alert than the previous episodes we have seen but if you still compared her last episode to an episode of her in early seasons its very clear she is different. She speaks different amp holds herself different but really you can tell in her eyes. And no I dont feel like coming clean could lose her the custody amp thats unfair. She shouldnt have custody while using PERIOD. A part of recovery is becoming honest with yourself amp your past lies. Leah hasnt even entered step  admitting that she has an addiction so thats really not good. when dealing with your own demons it gets hard before its gets better. thats a fact. I dont think Leah is ready to face that yet. It doesnt seem like it at least.Im not a Leah hater. I hope the best for her I really do but the girl is clearly still using.

8025181,0,t3_4p50ae,I was really annoyed by Dr. Drew pushing her to stay married because HE didnt think their problems were that bad...thats completely irrelevant. Kailyn and Javi could decide to break up because she hates chocolate milk and he loves it and thats  their business. As an adult I get to decide what I dont want to deal with in a relationship and it doesnt matter if other people think Im being ridiculous because this is my life.  I have to wake up every morning and live with my choices you dont.I think the difference between a rough patch and too late to change depends on whether or not a couple wants to work through it. And as an outside spectator I dont get to have an opinion on what a couple chooses to work through. I also think sometimes people women in particular will use one thing as an excuse to break up when the problem is much deeper. Javi seems really controlling and overbearing with Kailyn. He also tends to try to isolate her by damaging her relationships with her friends and Jo. These types of behaviors are the hallmark of mental and physical abusers. Maybe Kailyn legitimately fears for her safety so she wants out but shes hesitant to call the father of her children abusive?  This is all a theory but it would explain why she doesnt have any desire whatsoever to work through their issues. Sorry for rambling. This is just a topic that drives me insane.

Giving him lots of info and every opportunity to BE THERE for Aubrey.Instead her comments about oh check the website then she never followed up.......feels like they are actually hoping Adam will fail. I swear Id have done anything to help avoid the hurt my child could feel....even if it means helping Adam through stuff he should be doing on his own.

8282912,0,t3_4sx4jz,Soo Ive seen many articles or subs about this topic and I am kind of convinced that it has switched over.At the very beginning everyone who personally met both the girls said Chelsea was stuck up and Jenelle was nice but I am wondering if fame had the opposite effect on them.  Chelsea seems over the fame not all over social media amp keeps to herself for the most part amp focuses on her child and relationship. Whereas Jenelles jumping all over the place being happy amp sad with outcomes of all her relationships and MTV. Maybe its just me not having any sympathy for Jenelle or what but I think its all how each girl handles the situation and clearly there are some who have handled the fame and cameras well and some who have not.,teenmom,d5cx90d,15,t5_2uw5s

What sticks out to me also is he always instigated fights with Jo example the whole child support thing Kail was willing to work with Jo until she talked to Javi and he insisted she take him to court. The whole sweat pants thing why does he feel the need to get into it. When Jo didnt want to give Isaac to them on Fathers Day he was insinuating Kail take him to court. Also I hate the fact that Isaac calls him dad it so wrong on so many levels. It would be fine if Jo was completely absent from his life but hes not.

This will lead to issues believe me my sons father treats him as an equal and he has some very frustrating traits from itI think Aubree to an extent is giving the adult treatment but there is the balance of knowing mom is actually in charge.  They both have some entitlement stuff going on.  I just think the Sophia stuff is a bit worse for both Farrah and that shes unchecked in some of the crap she pulls.  Thats not her fault though shes unchecked.I think Sophia is going to grow into her looks.  I think her features will really be freaking amazing as she gets older shes just a bit awkward now but thats okay!  All of these kids are going to hit some awkward phases in their lives.  I dont like how people can say bad things about kids features.  I guess me saying shes a bit awkward right now could cross a line but I dont think it will last long.

8723112,0,t1_d6vhu33,Addiction as well as abuse and addictionrelated abuse are unfortunately very familiar to me and I know that these issues transcend any socioeconomic boundaries when it comes to impact on mental health. Addicts can certainly be decent when they are sober. And Im glad you said that because despite my experiences I think that demonizing formerlifelong addicts once theyre clean is totally unproductive and I didnt do anything to help that stigma that exists. I do believe it is a disease and I know how it changes a persons behavior to extremes even between short periods of being under the influence. The thing to me is that CampT seemed to frame the actions of April amp Co. as emotionally abusive beyond their addict personality. Either way when your own parent didnt change when you were growing up how do you  trust them to essentially help raise your child? Thats a hard one for me.,teenmom,d6w13h8,1,t5_2uw5s

But yeah people dont understand the breed and the wrong kind of people are attracted to them. I reeeeally think people should have to take a class or get a liscene to be able to own a pitt just due to the stigma that surrounds the breed right now amp how many are killed in shelters. this year our animal control JUST made pitt bulls adoptable. before this year ANY pitt which was TONS and fucking the majority of dogs coming in! that entered our animal control were put to sleep immediately just because of the breed. its so fucked up. edit  Hell I just went all to my local craigslists amp saw TONS of Purebred Blue nose Pitt Puppies for over . meanwhile right now  of our shelter is pitts a lot of them puppies wtf is wrong with people?!?!?!??!

8837976,0,t3_517oyn,Maci and CateTyler early on were the ones everyone rooted for. They seemed to have plans looked as though they were on their way and nothing has really transpired. They turned into disappointments to their fans. When this happens people will turn and anything they do is more harshly criticized. Great example is the Duggars. I think its opposite with Chelsea. No one could see her not being  in love with Adam or not always running to daddy in a crisis. She seems to have matured over the years. Turned out in the eyes of the fans better then expected. So if she does do something that can be criticized it is less harsh.  ,teenmom,d7a77d3,48,t5_2uw5s

Maci dancing at her Bachelorette party isnt a problem at all what I found to be profound was that she posted it to social media after condemning Farrah for being trashy. If anyones actions have a DIRECT reflection on Bently it is Macis. I also never said Chelsea is a class act I said she is open about her personality and who she is...

She probably thought hed either a fall in love with it and change his mind or b she could convince him it was too late and they had to keep it.The overnight montage was definitely odd.

They are now the topic of discussion and the focus of the show. I have a feeling that they dont care if its good or bad press that theyre getting as long as they are getting something. Anything that will keep them relevant. I am sure they knew that smoking while driving was going to be a big deal. And if they didnt theyre completely screwed.EDIT also MTV probably wants to put these things on the show to keep the ratings up. Hopefully theyll address the impaired driving subject because to many ignorant youths are defending that on SM. thats scary. We share the roads with those idiots,teenmom,d7cw0jr,4,t5_2uw5s

And how is it a job when he has no responsibilities besides to allow MTV to film him and the occasional reenactment. It requires no training and no skills. They should get jobs outside of this show because this MTV money train isnt going to last forever and it seems like they all live above their means and frivolously spend. The show was originally intended to show what it was like to be a teen parent and show struggles. None of them struggle with making k a year. ,teenmom,d7cxxh6,6,t5_2uw5s
8861006,0,t1_d7cyey2,I get where youre coming from I really do.  i was a vegetarian for ten years.  A year or so ago I moved to a rural area with my boyfriend and we were surrounded by all these small family run farms.  We visited one once and my boyfriend asked hypothetically if I would eat a chicken from that farm.  I thought about and decided yeah I would.  So thats how me occasionally eating meat came about.  I agree with you though about most humane meat.  Like if you go into a supermarket and buy grassfed humane ground beef or something the odds are that cow was not humanely treated at all and also that the farm it came from is not at all sustainable.,teenmom,d7cyuw6,1,t5_2uw5s
8861413,0,t1_d7cyw4y,Exactly this. Look I have a job right now but recently I was told that I will no longer have that job by the end of next summer. At that point I had two choices I could either start preparing for the next step or bury my head and the sand and spend up all of my paychecks on bullshit. I decided to take the money I make now and spend it on training for a new career path. You know the same thing most adults do.The show is a job but its a job that affords them opportunities that most of them have squandered. Teen Mom will not go on forever. I dont begrudge them the life theyre living I really dont. However if I were in their shoes you bet your ass Id be doing some planning for the future. ,teenmom,d7d0mh6,7,t5_2uw5s

I was terrified of SIDS and did a lot of research before our twins were born and after and always asked their pediatrician all sorts of questions about how to keep them as safe as possible. And Im sure theres tons of stuff we still screw up! I have nephews whose girlfriends both got pregnant when they were  and . Both girls graduated high school early and married my nephews and based on what I see theyre good loving and attentive moms. But they both had their babies in front facing car seats before they were even a year old and they werent big children at all. It horrified me but they both go to like mom education classes where they get credits that helps them get baby gear like strollers and cribs and car seats. Designed for young mothers just like them. So theyre doing more than a lot of people to be prepared and do the right thing but even the people teaching them are either careless about it or misinformed themselves. And no one else around them seems to see it as an issue either. I think theres just a lot of safety things that go unsaid because people assume its not their place dont know how to bring it up without coming off like theyre criticizing a mom or its things like blanketsstuffed animals in cribs or the wrong car seat for the wrong sized kid that people are misinformed about or havent kept up with changing regulations and recommendations. ,teenmom,d7f33zh,5,t5_2uw5s

8947290,0,t1_d7n0iiq,as someone who has depression i can say that cates current look is definitely a result of being depressed. im not proud of it but at my lowest i literally wouldnt brush my teeth brush my hair leave the house or even leave my bed. i would also wear the same thing almost everyday especially if i wasnt leaving the house. its so easy to get into that routine when your mind is in a dark and sad place.with that being said i got help because i realized that this wasnt how i wanted to live my life. one of the things i learned in therapy was to just take each day in little steps by at least getting up combing my hair amp brushing my teeth. the next day i would comb my hair and try to pick out a nice outfit etc and pretty soon i started feeling better by just doing these little things each day. even just getting dressed instead of staying in my pajamas can make a world of difference for me and its actually recommended if you have depression. i still have my bad days but i literally see my old self in cate when i watch this show.,teenmom,d7nbyv5,5,t5_2uw5s

9021189,1,t3_53t8p3,Do you think that its possible that Tyler feels this way because of how things turned out?  The first few years would have been very shaky but now Tyler and Catelynn are welloff like all of the other parents on TM.  Maybe he sees his current financial state and think Wow if only we knew what was to become?.I think perhaps he feels some regret from this.  In the earlier seasons when April was a bitch and Butch was in jail they kept repeating to themselves how much better off Carly is.  But now they never say this because in their minds they are good parents kinda and they could see Carly living with them.  Of course they have their issues but I think their lack of parenting skills is a touch over exaggerated here.Also maybe its because I have children but if I was going to give one up Im sorry but Id always be secretly pissed at the adopted parents for limiting and controlling my interactions with my birth child in an open adoption.  Im not really sure how an open adoption works but if CampT were promised a much more open adoption than what is happening then yea Id be pissed too.  They gave BampT the most special gift and it seems like BampT dont really appreciate it as much anymore.  They want to move on with their khaki pants and passive aggressive facial reactions but welp your birth parents are on a reality show. Get over it.I get the threat of  year old super fans stalking them and such but I think perhaps being in the public is the price they have to pay for getting a newborn.  So many loving amazing couples would kill for this gift and BampT got two!  You cant get what you want and still have everything your way in my opinion.  Sacrifices and compromising have to made and what Tyler and Cateylnn want should be factored into this complex relationship.,teenmom,d7w7evr,-4,t5_2uw5s

I feel like her bitch attitude is more for show and compared to all the other teen moms she is very smart with investing and creating revenue.  I believe when Simon  says shes different with the cameras when they are filming. She can be a insufferable person on camera but I believe shes so guarded and hostile towards people because of her up bringing.  Simon probably breaks her walls down and brings her back to reality which is a good .  She has enough people kissing her ass its nice to see her with a challenge ,teenmom,d86o7z1,17,t5_2uw5s

But Rhine basically needs someone to manage his life. Now thats where the Maci characteristics end Rhine doesnt need to be with someone whos daily life revolves so heavily around drinking.

I doubt anyone would because even though it was socially acceptable in the s for white people to dress up like black people and mimic the accents for comedy its terrible racially offensive. So while Im not one of those PC people that finds a reason to take offense at every little thing I do think its mean and offensive to mock somebody for their inherent traits ESPECIALLY if you are paying that person to preform work for you!

Naomi  Same as the other  episodes I dont care about raphI still love himI hate raphnope I love himAmber  I find her so hard to relate too I think its because shes putting on an act.

9694730,0,t1_da5uoj6,Well I just wanted to give you a virtual internet hug because I feel your suffering. I think for most people its impossible to grasp how horrible and isolating it is to not have a loving mother. In our society its very common to have an absent or cold deadbeat father but when your mother is the one who is the problem it can be really horrible and people make comments and try to justify their behavior by saying something about oh mothers just love you so much Im sure shes just... fill in excuse here. So I get it. Ive recently started a tradition where I watch Mommy dearest for mothers day. . Um Im really not sure. They seem to acknowledge him now. This is tricky for me because I feel like there was a big gap between her  and pregnant and when Teen Mom started. In  and pregnant it seemed to me it wasnt just her parents that did not want Derek in their lives but Farrah didnt seem to want him around either. He was dead by the time Sophia was born and we saw no signs from Farrah that she gave a care. She just seemed to want to immediately start dating again and go to restaurant school. Now could this be because she was just a young stupid teenager? Maybe. I dont know... but personally speaking I always saw Farrahs delayed grief for Derek as her grieving being alone. Being a single mom and not having a partner and just being sad about wondering how things may have been better for her if he hadnt of died. I could be wrong but thats how I see it. And even if thats the case and I am right in thinking that... she could definitely be deflecting blame onto her parents like you made me kick him out of my life even though at the time she seemed more than complicate and happy to do so. ,teenmom,da82xre,2,t5_2uw5s

9699859,0,t1_da8jl6u,I agree. It also could be that OP doesnt actually follow TM as much as much of the sub doesdoesnt know the history of the girlses as well as many of us?Cause I could somewhat understand someone seeing Kail that way if theyd only really paid attention to her this season and last seeing her have a nice house and car and being complainy while Javi was deployed and such. But for as much as I hate Kale shes actually probably one of the least lazy who has continued actually pursuing a university education and makes way more money from MTV than Javi makes and I bet is actually decently smart with saving and future planning. She wanted the medical benefits for her and Isaac sure but shes pretty damn independent otherwise. To a level that really contributed to their marriage failing I think.,teenmom,da8pq9o,8,t5_2uw5s

9748044,0,t1_dae390d,Uh no you are borderline sexist because you cant seem to realize that men can have long lastings effects from abusive relationship just like women can. Ambers past abusive behavior doesnt absolve Gary of responsibility for his present day actions but they do explain them. Acting like Gary has no reason to hold resentment towards Amber and worry about his child when she is around the woman who abused both of them is just foolish. Like Ive said Gary is far from perfect but portraying Amber as a victim when she abused him and their child is wrong on so many levels. The things Amber did to him were truly terrible and it pisses me off when people like you try to act like it doesnt matter since he was passive aggressive manipulative towards her and it happened years ago. Idk about you but I would much rather have a partner who is manipulative rather than someone who beats me and degrades me as a person on a daily basis.,teenmom,daenq60,1,t5_2uw5s

You have  kids youre a deadbeat dad who doesnt pay child support you have a history of conning women and stealing from them not to mention getting them pregnant abandoning them and denying paternity. You have a history of lying about your past claiming you were Vice President of two companies one of which was a selfpublishing company under which you paid to have a book published the other a charity for children who have been sexually abused whose real president claimed vocally on twitter that you volunteered immediately befriended her and then tried to scam her. You have lived under at least two aliases that we know of Matt Baker and Grey Baker.You have been charged with sexually assaulting your ex girlfriend  although she committed suicide before the charges could be brought to court.At  You wrote verbally abusive messages to members of a reality show about teen mothers on twitter a reality show which has been following these vulnerable and emotionally unstable women since they were .You tried to score dates with members of the reality show with no success until Amber. As soon as she agreed to a date you vacated your apartment and geographical area and immediately imposed yourself on this lonely and vulnerable woman so you could move in and live with her for free. Or suggest she pays you by getting on her show and convincing her to lend you money so that you can buy houses in your name.You claimed to have addiction problems in order to ingratiate yourself with this vulnerable lonely recovering addict and force yourself on her as her live in conman boyfriend knowing from TV that she is emotional desperate for love and affection. Although claiming to be sober you are regularly seen drinking on camera while making claims of sobriety.You then go on to move your drug addict son who you have not seen for ten years and know nothing about into this womans house for free thus enabling him to abandon his pregnant girlfriend in Boston . She is now alone and either heavily pregnant or with a young infant not receiving child support.This woman is showing signs of codependency and drug use. After being released from prison she is now avoiding spending time with her daughter so you can broadcast the pathetic lies she has believed to the public.And you are scummy enough to carry all this off while cameras are recording you.It is so tragic and its almost criminal that Dr Drew hasnt said more.,teenmom,daluytu,23,t5_2uw5s

9868982,0,t1_datxq6i,I think its because a lot of us dont see how its a job. No snark to you I just think thats why people get upset. They act as though they work hard no they dont. Cameras just follow them or stand stationary in front of couches all day... Cough cough Amber and Cate... That is not working so personally I dont see it as a job. Do I think they should get paid? Yes but its not a job. I mean if I was sitting on a couch with a camera crew filming me all day Id never say it was a job... Thats absurd. They are paid for allowing the public access to their lives its not working. Yes MTV profits from them so yeah they deserve a cut but calling it a job it crazy.

9871826,1,t3_5gq3xm,Another thing that grinds my gears about Farrah is how she made this situtation between Amber and Matt all about her. Its obvious that Amber is in a shitty relationship with Matt and shes going back to her old ways so of course they doubt Farrah when she tries to call them earlier this season. My best friend was in an abusive relationship herself and although I was concerned for her but I stick around and allow her to make the decision herself without cutting her out. If Farrah does care about the friendship between her and Amber then she wouldnt do what she did and go as far as blabbering about the two negatively in an interview or wherever else. So Instead of saying Well those two can stay out of my life! How about be compassionate and still stick around just in case Amber changes her mind? ,teenmom,daubma8,-1,t5_2uw5s

He was totally in love with me and wrote me letters and stuff... Ive been with my nowhusband since I was a teenager so I rejected this guy pretty much daily. Well now hes dating this girl who I guess just found out about this and took his phone and sent me an angry message from his FB and blocked me. Then she went and did this to a few of our mutual friends only girls. Huge red flag... I know this guy and Im  sure he would go along with whatever she does as long as she doesnt leave him. He has very low selfesteem.  Also one of our work buddies died this year at  mass organ failure  and this guy has been having a really rough time about it we all have and weve all been like supportgrouping on FB. But now I cant even talk to him because this girl has commandeered his social life and apparently is holding his phone hostage!  Meanwhile a couple of our mutual friends have decided its my fault hes dating a crazy chick because I rejected him.

My family got together for this first time in over half a decade and he criticized my brother and I for drinking more than  drink at dinner and then driving ourselves home  hours later. He also in no uncertain terms called me a piece of shit for decisions I made in my life that in NO WAY affected him. Hes always been my favorite sibling but now I feel no connection to him.

10138306,0,t3_5l4h1e,I think that every adoption situation is different and theres no one size fits all for how to handle it. For example one of my family friends was adopted from Guatemala as a baby and has been living with her adoptive mother in the U.S. since then. It was a closed adoption and she didnt know who her biological mother was until a few years ago. She got to meet her bio mom and bio halfsiblings who she still has contact with. But her adoptive mother is and always will be her mother but now she also has a bio mom. Ive also known people who have had open adoptions and choose to have no relationship with their biological parents so they consider their adoptive parents to be their only parents. Sometimes adoption means that a child has a set of adoptive parents and a set of biological parents and sometimes adoption means that a child only has one set of parents or one parent. It varies greatly from child to child. Carly is biologically Catelynn and Tylers child but beyond that her relationship to themwith them is yet to be determined. I think as she grows up and has more free will in how much contact she has with them that it will become more clear. The same goes for her relationship with Nova and any other Children that C amp T have it might be brothersister or something else or she might have no relationship with them. For now like others have commented I think Catelynn should say third pregnancy second child. ,teenmom,dbt0xl0,5,t5_2uw5s

10145913,0,t1_dbtt46f,Ok so admittedly I too ma struck by how much unecessary yelling Babs does. I dont think shes ever not yelling season  thats how much she yells. I kinda get how as a teenager you might write her off as crazy. That said I understand why she used Jenelles financial aid against her. Jenelle at that point had nothing to lose other than her education and it seemed to be the only incentive with which Babs could punish her. Jenelle never cared to see Jace more than an hour a week she crashed in her car when she needed to she ate off other peoples dime everyone in her life was an enabler and Babs just didnt have anything to take away from her at that point besides the financial aid check. Plus she mailed it back to teh college right after jenelle stole her credit cards so its not like she did it for no reason. I would be pissed too and punish Jenelle accordingly. When Jenelle asks Babs for the papers to file for financial aid in teh first place she doesnt give her any notice. She calls her at am before Babs goes to work and says hey im coming over get me this tax form I need it by today or something. Idk about everyone else but my parents keep that shit in a giant pile of papers in a safe which you need at least  minutes of rummaging through to find the paper. It was disrespectful to Babs time for her to ask so last minute. ,teenmom,dbu0ks5,4,t5_2uw5s

Ive never seen a fun cute or easy going side to Kail. at this point I could give a fuck less about her lack of family support because shes had a LOT of support from her friends exboyfriends and their families AND MTV!!!! I WISH I had MTV putting cheques into my bank account when I was struggling and near homeless. Kail doesnt recognize she has issues its everyone else with the issue. Never Kail. With her money her being in university and her having MTV she has more than enough means to find a therapist to talk about her issues with work through it.you get to a certain point and age in your life where you need to stop blaming others and start taking accountability for your actions.

Ill admit shes probably the most together girl on the show but that doesnt mean shes perfect and everyone wants to be her. Shes still a girl who got famous for getting pregnant at  took FOREVER to get her GED then kept dropping in and out of beauty school and any other school. Now shes maybe working as an esthician? Shes really accomplished nothing for herself but now we all love and and consider her a successful and having come so far because she managed to find a decent guy and got pregnant as soon as she could with him? Thats considered successful now? Finding a guy marrying him and having his baby? The other girls find guys every other day and have kids with them and theyre considered trainwrecks granted they are trainwrecks but Chelsea does it and shes considered successful for it.

10313777,0,t3_5nmt1m,Since there is a quite a few stories in here about yall having loved ones going through addiction I want to give you a few tips.  DO NOT ENABLE. NEVER EVER EVER give them money. If they are stealing shit from you dont let them in your house period or even give them the opportunity. My own mother who I wasnt even living with or stole any of her shit in my addiction wouldnt let me even inside her house for several years even after I started doing better Addicts will have to learn quickly that trust broken that badly means you have a long hard fight to get it back. And it doesnt happen overnight. That was really hard for me to learn in early recovery. Make sure you are doing NOTHING that makes their addiction easier to manage.  DO NOT PUSH THEM AWAY. I am saying keep your distance right now but also come about it like you still care for them amp want them to get better. TRY NOT TO LET ADDICTS FUCK YOU OVER that goes into enabling because that just builds anger amp resentment. Try to get them into treatment. Yeah treatment isnt cheap so hopefully they have insurance. Some programs have scholarships. Some have waiting lists. If you dont have insurance that is probably there only option. Do not make treatment a far out in the distance thing Drive their ass to a hospital detox and use the time they are there to try to get them into some program. If they dont wanna go...say well Im not taking you home. YOUR LOVED ONE IS NOT IN THEIR RIGHT MIND RIGHT NOW. TRY NOT TO TAKE TO HEART THE SHITTY THINGS THEY ARE SAYINGDOING TO YOU. I know...easier said then done but for me I am a COMPLETELY different person when Im in addictive addiction in my deepest I STILL am tortured by some of my awful behavior. That is not who I am amp luckily I had loved ones who tried to understand the disease amp they KNEW that wasnt me anyways.   Unless they go to treatment or are working a program dont believe they are soberclean. You have a better chance of winning the lotto then an addict waking up one morning amp being like OK IM COMPLETELY DONE  and then being completely done.   MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS ALSO IMPORTANT. If they refuse rehab try to get them to at least see a therapist. Guilt trip them. I was very DEFENSIVE about people talking to me about my addiction but randomly a select few would get through. For me...my addiction had to get worse then the pleasure. Of course it really is a ticking time bomb. Most die before they get to the stage of being completely seriously ready to have a lifestyle change. That is why its so scary. Also no addicts are happy. Some say they are but addicts lie all the fucking time. And if they really DO appear happy Im thinking of some people personally on uppers they are probably fucked up or in some kind of psychosis lol. DO NOT GIVE UP ON THEM. If my loved ones had given up on me no way in HELL I would be here right now. I put them through complete fucking hell and they never gave up on me.That straight up saved my life! Im not going to lie. I still struggle. Ive been on suboxone for  years currently trying to get off and its been one of the worst experiences of my life. I will ALWAYS have this struggle.But now I am fighting to get better. I now have a life that is better then the addiction lifestyle. It really is the worst and the stigma really doesnt help. Pretty much everyone looks down on addicts....its SHAMEFUL admitting you have a problem which it should be celebrated! Addicts brains are different. That is a SCIENTIFIC FACT. AND DRUGS CHANGE YOUR BRAIN!!! I feel so bad for you all going through this but being the one going through it is just as bad....sure we get to turn it off every once in awhile unlike the loved ones having to watch this but its also with us every minute or every day....and probably will be forever. It sucks. I wish I had never tried any of this crap but it took YEARS of me feeling so depressed amp suicidal before I was stupid enough to try a substance. Worst fucking mistake I ever did. My life would be so different amp it sucks so bad thinking that this is going to be there the rest of my life. ,teenmom,dcd4fpc,15,t5_2uw5s

Posts on social media that they didnt use condoms so I guess those  abortions didnt teach her anything about how pregnancy happens  Moves back and forth from her city to baby daddys city three whole times because they keep breaking up He proposes via paying for an engagement ring tattoo for her on her ring finger... and they break up again for good. She has a few flings with guys who she posts on social media about being amazing father figures for her kid theyre meant to be jenelle soul mate style. None last. She has another abortion with one of these guys. Starts dating a new guy  months in she gets pregnant. This guy is all over it and posts nonstop Facebook posts about how amazing she is as a mother and their little family. I do some digging and find out that hes not even legally divorced yet. He was still posting statuses about loving his wife in August then posting angry statuses about hating his wife in September and then in February suddenly shes preggers. Hes posting about his future child nonstop on his own Facebook and tagging her in it... surely to alert the ex wife. Im just sayin... thats a spite baby if Ive ever seen one. Shes since had the kid and they moved into her parents house. Any time he comments on her social media she makes a comment about him needing to put a ring on it over top of her permanent engagement ring tattoo from her last baby daddy and he never acknowledges it.  I honestly still dont think hes legally divorced and Im pretty sure she had this second kid to absolve her guilt of three previous abortions and get him to marry her.

Matt knows that if Amber slaps her name on pretty much anything people will buy it and money in her pocket is money in his.

She makes the decision season after season to come back. It might be harsh but its on her. We can empathise for her which a lot of us do but that doesnt change the circumstances. Shes acted in a shady manner on a reality tv show that she is paid a lot of money to be on. Viewers are going to judge and comment. If she has a problem with that she should modify her behaviour or not come back. Crying monkey when you dont like the line of questioning and backflipping on your statements you made in court doesnt sit well with people. If we cant call her out and question it... whats the point in even being on the show?,teenmom,dcpiolj,12,t5_2uw5s

10423927,0,t3_5p72i1,Oh I agree that Javi is childish and immature... But Kail made the dumbass decision to marry him for the military benefits before knowing what kind of person he was or if they went well together. I also think Kail was sneaking around behind his back. She cheated on Jordan on national TV and didnt have an ounce of sympathy for him. I know Javi may have had some jealousy issues but Kail continued to put everyone else before himtheir marriage. He wanted to go on a vacation alone with her she wanted to bring Sterling. He said he didnt want Sterling to go and Kail gets pissed off and has a tantrum. Kail is a really horrible person who only looks out for herself and doesnt really care who her actions affect as long as it benefits her. I agree that she needs to stay single for a veeeerry long time just based on her maturity level alone. Plus watching her force a relationship between her kids and some random brown bae would make me want to throat punch her. ,teenmom,dcpmdf5,50,t5_2uw5s

10527862,0,t3_5qr1ia,Ive said it in a previous thread but I think theres a legal agreement that we arent aware of because there are some legal things that must stay confidential. And I think her threats arent made up but they are essentially empty. She can threaten all she wants but she cant because of said private agreement. Thats my take on it. I think in the earlier seasons she was oblivious but still seriously believed she could win. Which is crazy because her life was a shit storm. I think that some tiny little voice in her really wanted to get better but she was to selfish to really try. I dunno if I made any sense lol but I think she cant really do anything now and her threats have no foundation. ,teenmom,dd1g4md,26,t5_2uw5s

To be calling those who view her situation as drug abuse ignorant because they are relating it to their experiences is incredibly invalidating. Also Im pretty sure all of us know Xanax isnt the only med for anxiety but it is a med that Leah has admitted to taking.

Im not saying the show should document them coping with Dereks death but I sometimes get the impression that because Farrah wasnt that close with him at the time of his death that she projects that onto Sophia? I mean the best scenes are when they visit his grave or when they did the adopt a highway scene but as a whole its odd to me the show doesnt really discuss him much.

10598054,0,t3_5r9tdt,Why would they not pay him for bringing in extra drama? As nice as that producer seemed to be I highly doubt they would have actually preferred to shoot a boring day of Adam with his kids. Does anyone really think MTV wants Adam to become super dad? Or to leave the show? Ive always thought he was a douche but really without an Adam story line chelseas segments would just be filming a normal family which doesnt make for good tv no matter how perfect it seems.I think this is especially an issue since chelsea just surpassed two big milestones wedding and baby and presumably there wont be any drama or excitement going on with her for a while. Unless chelsea starts doing drugs or gets pregnant again or gets a divorce she still needs that Adam drama. I wouldnt be surprised if they did fine cast members but not for shit like driving away and making a big scene cause producers love that shit. I know on real world the challenge cast members are fined for pretty much doing anything that the cameras cant capture or that cant be recorded like having a cell phone conversation or even confronting someone in the house about something without a camera person present. Obviously the rules would be a bit different on TM but I wouldnt doubt it if some of the cast just eat the fines for the sake of privacy i.e kailyn refusing to talk about javi on camera. A couple thousand dollars in production fines probably doesnt seem like a big  sacrifice when you pull in  a season.,teenmom,dd93w39,1,t5_2uw5s

Also shes trying really hard to show is how good shes doing she probably was mentally editing her answers carefully.Also Im sorry but I think Nessa asking do you think youll get married again? to two freshly divorced women is in poor taste.

Ive never met anyone in any similar situation thats legit happy about their circumstances.I would respect her a whole lot more if she admitted to being overwhelmed with life making some mistakes etc. Not with her momcustody bs but just admitting that shes in a shitty situation.

I mean she knew Im sure before she registered for class that she had no intentions of getting back with Javi she should have told them what her plans are.

10770180,0,t1_ddqo0yc,There is. It shows up in the meconium. Some hospitals test all moms and babies automatically. Edit Theres very little quality research on this question. We have some studies indicating that its bad for babies but they are extremely poor quality. Most of the ones showing negatives effects dont separate mothers who just smoked weed with mothers who abused a variety of drugs along with weed. So its not surprising that the moms who smoked weed AND crack AND meth and shot up heroin had babies with problems. Studies that dont have that confound dont appear to show any negative effects whatsoever from THC exposure in utero in fact one seemed to show developmental gains but there arent many of these so its fair to say the jury is still out.  ,teenmom,ddqv4o0,16,t5_2uw5s

Her mom who would provide a lot of the childcare for her would beg her to get on birth control since she already had the first kid from missing a depo shot offered to pay for an iud and everything but pregnant again.

It seems written way too coherently to be from Farrah so take it for what its worth.gtFrom reality TV to porn to appearances at strip clubs and sex expos it seems like Farrah Abraham will do anything to make a buck.gtBut her newest moneymaking venture is perhaps her most jawdropping move yet Farrahs exBFF claims the Teen Mom star has been working as a professional sugar baby flying out to spend time with rich men  for a fee  that she meets through an a website.gtFarrah told me she met this guy on a sugar daddy website sugardaddyforme.com Farrahs former friend and Kris Humphries ex Myla Sinanaj told RadarOnline.com in an exclusive interview.gtShe flew out to see him and everything. She said they give you money to like go on vacation or to go shopping. They pay your bills.gtAs for what these men get in return RadarOnline.com is not suggesting Farrah is providing anything more than company but Myla suggests When youre meeting up with them they already know why.gtFarrah and Myla became friends when the two shared a manager earlier this year. Before long Farrah texted Myla trying to convince her to join the sugar daddy site Myla claims but she refused.gtFarrah basically was like You have to try this site. I got a guy whos loaded Myla claimed.gtI personally didnt trust it. First anyone can go on there and claim to be rich.gtIn text message correspondence exclusively obtained by Radar Farrah admitted using a website to find millionaires  confessing that she herself is NOT a millionaire!gtGirlfriend people think that Im a millionaire but Im not not even close to it Farrah wrote. So this site is really good for you finding millionaires you should just try it you never know.gtMyla responded haha sounds like fun but I dont think its my thing lolZ I care more about the attraction then the  because what are u gonna do ask for ? Its theirs  I need to actually like a person.gtBut undeterred Farrah wrote I just emailed you gtFarrah begged Myla to join her on the sugar daddies and babies cruise around Manhattan on August  where the two could meet dozens of eligible men.gtAgain Myla said no way.

I feel like her shirt comment was a bad attempt at a joke. She was talking about his biceps  which I imagine most guys would find pretty pleasing? Javi and Jo have huge families Kail has no one. Jo obviously is happy to work with Kail over the Christmas holiday so why cant Javi? And you know damn well Javi wouldve been the worst about Jo asking to have Isaac for Christmas.

I just wanted him to calm down and for us to be a family and I felt like that was her struggle too at first anyways. I even felt bad for Farrah at first! I just knew that being a first time Mom was hard enough for me and I was a grown woman so my heart went out to all of them.So I still feel weirdly invested in what happens to the girls and kids and my son is around their age so I like watching them go through the same milestones he is going through.

Thats way too young to even begin to understand the complexities of the adoption why CampT felt the need to place Carly why they dont see her a lot etc. They should wait until Nova is a few years older before they tell her about the adoption but I have a feeling they wont. They probably wont even explain it very well or implicate that BampT somehow stole Carly from them. ,teenmom,de80y6x,15,t5_2uw5s

We didnt grow up together we were both in our thirties at the wedding. She has an adorable  year whom I havent met yet. My parents go to her to see their grand kid and the one time she visited my parents she left him home cause she doesnt feel small children should fly. I think IDKWhy would I go  on and on about a cousin my kids rarely if ever see and  make it a sad thing???Trashey If Catlyn put Carly interests first  then she wouldnt want Carly to miss them!  To Catlyn mothering seems to end when you push a kiddo outoh and then you always get fawned over for being selfless enough to go through  laborTo me its disgustingand they should be the last people representing either adoption or open adoptionclearly they are a mess and doing all sorts of wrong! ,teenmom,de83071,6,t5_2uw5s

10937708,0,t1_de82sdw,To be fair Jenelle does have a slightly really really low chance of getting Jace back and IS Jaces mom still because Babs is Jaces grandma in Jaces eyes at the moment. Whereas with Cait she doesnt have a chance in HELL to get Carly back at all. Even if B amp T were to pass away Im sure Carly would go to a closer relative of B amp Ts not Cait and Ty. That being said this is also why its sad to think about Jaces situation considering Jenelle could have done more sooner to get him back at an age where he wouldnt be as affected by the change at this point hes so old he just should stay with Babs. BUT when he was at a younger age Jenelle was a bigger trainwreck. That entire situation is just sad. ,teenmom,de85c60,3,t5_2uw5s

People who come from poor or middle class families who get rich quickly are like sheltered kids who go to college and have no idea how to handle themselves away from their parents so they go wild. Now the TMs are so far from their roots that they probably dont remember the reality they may one day face again. Its one thing to say Yup tomorrow this might all be gone and if so well deal with it. Its another thing entirely to actually go through it. If they could envision what it would really be like to have to seriously downgrade their lifestyle and go to working a  or god forbid a job like Barbisntgoodenough Walmart just to survive they would change paths so quickly and start putting away as much as they possibly could. Right now its still building up and theyre living pretty lavishly so they have no real idea how fast it goes even just living a modest lifestyle with growing kids and a family vacation or two a year.Edit Why downvotes?

11100023,0,t1_depiw0n,I am in the military and got dumped on my deployment.  Luckily no kids no house no mortgage.  We also werent married either.  But I did predicate basically everything from where I was living to my graduate program on this girl who I figured I was going to marry.I got dumped out of the blue but I am almost  positive that it was because my ex at the time was seeing someone else.  But didnt have the nerve to tell me.  I know as such because once I got dumped I basically turned into a maniacal madman and stalked every single move she ever made on social media constantly texted her emailed her whatever.  It was fucking pathetic.  I look back on it and cringe now that I am married and a little bit older.But at the time I was literally paranoid and almost clinically insane.  When Id consider myself an otherwise rational person.  When I was deployed I had no friends.  I had nowhere to go.  Same thing every single day.  Go to work go to the gym play a video game and fall asleep.  Rinse lather repeat.  I had nowhere to turn besides my parents and what adult really wants to dish out all their dirty laundry to their parents.  Meanwhile I saw her friends on social media telling her to cheer up that they were going to take care of her pictures of her going shopping out to eat out to the bar whatever.  It infuriated me because I could do nothing but just sit there in my bunk.When you are deployed it feels like time stands still.  Everything I could reference to in the states was a year old.  All I did was look forward to doing the things I did before I left or the future I had planned with this particular person.  When all of that went away it ate away at my stomach every night because I literally had no idea what I was going to do when I got home.  Where was I going to live?  Who was I going to hang out with?  What was I going to do with my spare time?  I had no fucking clue.  Either way this is not a sob story.  I couldnt care less anymore about this particular person but I consider myself an otherwise rational level headed guy and I was fucking pathetic during this time.  Paranoid delusional obsessive.  Id say never in a million trillion years would I ever hop a fence or break into a house to catch someone cheating but if I ever would...it would have been during this time.  I was fucking nuts and it was embarrassing.,teenmom,deq6f1p,8,t5_2uw5s

11157113,0,t3_5z766x,In some ways he has a point. In some ways he doesnt. Either way the way he went about it is incredibly rude and uncalled for.On the one hand yes we want to see people in professions who sort of practice what they preach or who look the part. A perfect example is the way some people on this sub make comments about Chelseas hair and makeup. It is usually stuff like shes an esthetician and yet her hair and makeup is ugly or something to that effect. Essentially the comments are saying that because she studies this stuff she should have better hair and makeup. Similarly if Im going to a trainer or dietician I expect them to be healthy. The place where I believe Nathan goes wrong is in tying health with weight. Seeing someone who is slightly overweight from the looks of the picture and assuming that she is unhealthy is wrong. There are people who have a higher BMI and may technically qualify as overweight and are very healthy bodybuilders Serena Williams body types and there are some people that are very thin that are very unhealthy.On top of all of this even if he thought that she was too unhealthy to be a trainer there still is no reason to post that on social media for everyone to see and try to shame that woman. People on the internet have been known to look people up and bully them. If people can find out what gym Nathan goes to they could also find out what trainers are employed there and find this woman and harass her online.,teenmom,dewnat3,3,t5_2uw5s

I also really do understand their desire for privacy in that this is Carlys story to tell and talk with people about when she wants to.  Some children have great feelings about adoption some can struggle with it at times.  It is hard because Carly deserves the right to tell people about her story when she is ready.  On the other hand as a birthmom I get really upset when people tell me I cant tell my story as a birthmom and my feelings.  It is a tough subject that a lot of birthmoms struggle with.  For me when I first placed and was in the dark and twisty part of placement I went under an assumed name and blogged often but kept it fairly nondescript  in that I didnt want my sons parents to take issue with it.

11277246,0,t3_60yawg,Full article The Ashley can exclusively reveal that the shows production team is planning to add a fifth girl to the TM lineupand the cast and crew are not happy about it. From what The Ashley hears the shows producers are bringing Teen Mom  girl Briana DeJesus to Teen Mom . In fact The Ashley has already been tipped off by several people who have seen Briana filming with the crew.For those that are assuming that this is just a Teen Mom  catchup special thats being filmed or something The Ashley can assure you thats not the case.Anyway Briana will be added into the mix with the regular girls which means the four original girls will see a reduction of their screen time next season if they even agree to be on the show with Briana at all! Several of the Teen Mom  girls have had beef with Briana in the past.Most of the cast and crew now know of MTVs plan to bring Briana onboard but a production source tells The Ashley that MTV was hoping to keep her casting a secret from the girls in hopes that they could film their realtime reactions to the news.After all it worked out well for the network when they blindsided Maci Bookout with the news that Farrah Abraham was coming back to Teen Mom OG a few years back Maci gave them a madeforTV reaction!A crew source tells The Ashley that the crew is not thrilled about having to add trips to Florida into their already busy travel schedules in order to film Brianas scenes.Briana is currently pregnant with her second child which will surely add to the drama in her scenes. Shes due to give birth in July. Another source of drama may be the fact that Briana and her sister Brittany are very good friends with Teen Mom  dad Javi Marroquin. At one time they were good friends with Kail as well they even got plastic surgery together last year! However The Ashley is not sure where the girls friendship with Kail currently stand.,teenmom,dfa9cmn,40,t5_2uw5s

11283202,0,t1_dfa9xhj,You are correct she did file but shes being misleading about the continuing. Not defending her or Barb but when she was finishing her certificate or whatever she said she continued because she didnt have time due to school and Kaiser  And there was another time she continued because she was between Nathan and David I believe it was around that time. When shes had too much going on in her life shes said its not a good time to get Jace custody stuff sorted. They both have continued the hearings she just rewrote history a bit on that bit lol Barbs lawyer will continue the hearing as much as they can just because its what lawyers do I think. Mine did for traffic stuff.  Edit to add One postponement was because of Hurricane Matthew as well. Here is a copypaste from TMJ back when Jenelle was postponing. She admitted to postponing once to go to couples therapy with Nathan and once because it wasnt a good time for her and school came first before Jace. Her words not mine lol When asked about the current custody orders and what she would like to see changed Jenelle responded with The custody order thats in place basically says Whatever Barbara says goes. And I want something set in stone to where it says Jenelle gets him these days. So that she has to follow by the guidelines. What Jenelle has described sounds more like a visitation schedule but I guess we know what shes getting at she wants time with her kid that she cant be jerked around on. But all recent accounts of Jenelles custody situation have reported that Jenelle has dropped the matter. Jenelle and her mother Barbara had a custody hearing on March   but the case was postponed until the next month. A source told Radar Online The April date is just another calendar hearing and that will likely be pushed forward too. Does the date March   seem familiar in relation to Jenelle? Well it might be because March th was also the day that Nathan was arrested for criminal domestic violence. Us Weekly reports that Jenelle postponed her court date for Jace so that she could instead attend couples therapy with Nathan.If that all wasnt strange enough viewers were shocked when Jenelle recently told Us WeeklyIm so busy with school and my externship. Im trying to tell my mom my lawyer and everyone Im like Look I know Jace is important right now but you know my graduation is coming up in July. So I mean that is just its the no.  priority right now. With the case postponed and Jenelle making these kinds of statements its hard to tell whats going on. Jenelle has since graduated from technical school but there has yet to be a resolution to this custody situation. It is obvious from this season of Teen Mom  however who Jace thinks of as his mother.,teenmom,dfaxn2q,3,t5_2uw5s
11283548,0,t1_dfay8z7,I completely agree with this. They have enjoyed MTV filming the good times and okay times and now they want to turn their backs when shit doesnt go their way. Nah fam. It doesnt work like that. They pay the girls to do a job. Im sure each season comes with pay raises and bonuses and they sign on for all of that. Theyve been doing this for what  years? They should know the drill by now. I have zero sympathy for them. Babs had every right to get a police report when Jenelle who is not his legal guardian and has no say in legal or physical custody took Jace without permission. She has every right to use that in court to show that Jenelle and David clearly lack boundaries and dont know their places as Jaces sometimes caretakers with no current legal rights.Pretty much everyone in the world has dealt with an overbearing asshole boss.

11305798,0,t1_dfddkku,I agree with you on this. People have difficulty understanding that every substance reacts completely differently on each person. That old AA idea about not using marijuana because it could trigger alcohol use came from a fearbased misinformed and previously unresearched area that then carried into NA and is what most people are familiar with. But we now know that different substances react in different ways and on different areas of the brain which complicates things quite a bit. Also what works for one person will not work for another. I have been a medical marijuana patient for  years. Im also a recovering heroin addict. So right off the bat many people would say I shouldnt use cannabis. But Im also a chronic pain patient who had GAD. So I use marijuana in place of the Xanax and OxyContin I had been prescribed for my conditions previously. It was actually the reason I was able to wean off of my medications successfully and no longer need them. Cannabis keeps me sober functional able to work and able to parent while at the same time taking the place of my other medications that put me in danger of constant relapse which can be immediate death for a heroin addict. I can safely say cannabis has saved my life and is my own personal antidrug. ,teenmom,dfdhu9b,12,t5_2uw5s

We just had the bit where Jenelle and Barbara return from the interviews with the attorneys and the difference between them is actually kind of sad.Jenelle is in the car on the phone with David and sounds almost celebratory telling him all the things her attorney got her mother on. All she said was that she doesnt know David that long yet etc etc. Barbara is in the kitchen talking to that horrid producer and has to swallow back the tears when she thinks about how much this is going to hurt Jace. I wish Barbara would just come out and say she has no intention of giving Jace back to Jenelle. I wish shed say that she is the only mother that child has known and that being taken away from her would be traumatic for him. Its not even about Jenelle being an unfit parent which she obviously is. It is about not taking a child away from the only home and only mother figure he has known all his life. God I hope Jenelle does what is best for Jace and leaves him to grow up in peace with his grandmother. Now that would be her ultimate motherly sacrifice. ,teenmom,dfkoy5b,21,t5_2uw5s

I basically spend money like all the money I have right now is all the money I will ever have like if its not essiential I usually wont buy it. Its so rare for me to make a just because purchase but I kind of want to make a just because purchase and its expensive. I kind of want to buy a new exercise bike. Theres technically nothing wrong with the one I have but I have  major complaints. Its LOUD and has gotten progressively louder over the last  months or so. I consulted the manual and followed the appropriate maintenance and that actually made it louder. Im not kidding. For reference I usually watch tv with the volume on  when Im on the exercise bike I have to turn it up to  and even then I cant understand what they are saying I have to read the subtitles. And that level of noise is over powering in a small room so I usually keep the sound On the tv low and just read the subtitles. A few months ago I only needed to turn the tv volume up to . So Im worried it will keep getting louder my family already complains about the noise. My second complaint is part of the console doesnt work right so I think its possible the whole console isnt working right. I mean how would I know if the calorie burn and mph ect is right? Its not an easy thing to test but those things are a luxury the bike still works without it. Im reluctant to buy a new one because what if it doesnt last long? The one I currently have is about  years old we really dont throw things away unless they are broke broke and even then if we can use it for parts well probably keep it around but out of curiosity I checked the warrentys the one I currently have had a  day warranty the one I was looking to buy has a  parts warranty and a  year frame warranty. But Ive had various appliance repairmen tell me how appliances and cars arent built to last anymore so that could extend to exercise equipment right? Idk am I being a big baby about  on sale from ? I also have  in gift cards but If I do buy it I probably wont catch the sale. Edit  the one Im looking at is a golds gym cycle trainer  ri. Anyone bought one of these before?

11423092,0,t1_dfjp5r6,I get what you were saying with Jenelle. I disagree in that ones seen though. It didnt feel forced to me at least with Jace. It seemed very genuine. If Jace didnt hug her I understand why. She is just so up and down and all over the place I think because she is still on drugs and her bipolar disorder is not in check. Remember when she went to treatment and was first diagnosed how calm she was? It was SO different such a relief. I blame the producers a bit for this. Its pretty clear what is going on and I think they are not doing anything because keeping her like this makes for good TV. This behavior is not normal for anyone. She was like this since the beginning but I honestly think that her bipolar disorder is so severe that manic is the norm for her and no one really knows that this just isnt really her. You basically have no control over your actions while you are severely manic. I know because I have bipolar. Anyway the point is that even if she doesnt scream at Jace which she does all the up and down and craziness she brings into his life you can see why he is uncomfortable. That would be so scary for a child and the poor boy will most likely never know what to expect from his mother especially if she stays on that show for the rest of her life. His life is pretty much ruined as far as I can see. She doesnt know how much trama she causes to his life and cant see still because she is in the mist of it. Smoking pot while pregnant causes ADD and what do you want to bet she drank too. The think is that was the worst thing she could have ever done to Jace because no one could see what a sweet loving and sensitive boy he was before he was medicated especially teachers and he was getting in fights because of poor impulse control. It that wasnt taken care of he would have failed preschool!,teenmom,dfqso1k,2,t5_2uw5s

11446243,0,t3_63dh7o,This may be an unpopular opinion but maybe Cate amp Tyler have moved on as much as they can past Carly. Of course to us its going to appear that they talk about carly and the what ifs all the time because MTV is pushing that and thats what makes good tv especially since April and Butch are seemingly doing better. Its a good plot line and helps viewers feel more connected to C amp T. Even as just Carlys birth parents I dont expect that they wont think about her every day for the rest of their lives. Thats part of being a parent even just a birth parent. I honestly dont feel like their lives would be that much different without MTV. I sincerely doubt that they would have graduated college and gone on to successful careers. I think theyd probably be working a lower paying job and using April as childcare. In this scenario they may not have as much time to reflect on the adoption but I think the regret would always still be there. ,teenmom,dftf6qy,19,t5_2uw5s

Its difficult enough to spend month after month year after year trying to conceive and watch yourself grow older while it feels like the world around you is exploding in babies and families. How it becomes more difficult to relate to anyone after countless when are you going to children conversations and no one wants to talk about your misfortune in not being able to have a family like anyone else can. Its a painful exhausting situation that rips you down a little more with every pregnancy announcement and so for that to be a joke to someone is absolutely wildly inappropriate and offensive. ,teenmom,dfubt77,7,t5_2uw5s

Lincoln is a bundle of energy and marches to his own drummer. Aubree kills me. Her little raspy voice and her personality. I love it. Watson is cute and seems to do baby stuff well. Bentley seems very smart and athletic but they show a very sweet side of him. Hes growing up into a very nice young man. Jade is beautiful and reminds me of Addie personality wise. Maverick is an adorable baby who is just doing his thing. Maci makes pretty babies. Sophia reminds me a lot of myself as a child. Shes in such an awkward age and I love her little weird self. The goofy faces and voices crack me up. I wish she had a more supportive parent because I think her true personality doesnt mesh with Farrah. Leah has my heart as favorite teen mom kid. I think shes going to struggle having to parent her parent but she seems very mature for her age and so far has shown interest in education. I hope she continues that and I hate that Amber has vague interest in her. Novalee looks like a precious moments doll and has a sweet voice.

Babs lets them take him on vacations all the time. Everyone knew exactly where they were going. She told them Im taking Jace to the hotel. Babs knew were he was and was able to pick him up whenever she wanted. If she had said Im taken Jace then turned her phone off and no one knew where they were then that Id consider kidknapping. Plus Babs made it very clearly she only called the police because she wanted to get David in trouble and send him to jail. She was using the legal system the same way Jenelle does when she gets mad at people. Always putting restraining orders on them and what not just to break it a day later when theyre on better terms. Babs was angry that Jenelle and her got into a fight and she blames David so she used this as a way to try and get him arrested. She didnt even care until MTV was like yeah we called the cops. Her reaction was like oh gees you called the cops. They pretty much worked her up and got exactly the reaction they wanted then drove her over to the hotel all mad and crying.

This has led some groups of internet clowns to speculate that Ensley is actually the child of Jenelles consistently recurring ex Kieffer Delp.

But for Cate I defiently agree that if people could SEE the issues she was having everyday that people wouldnt be as hard on her. But then again I dont buy into the whole she isnt doing anything to help herself argument the fact we see her around so much working spending time with family or friends shows she is making efforts. I think the biggest issue is its largely on her to find a good therapist and Im not entirely convinced someone as depressed as she is is able to make an accurate choice about who is a good therapist and who isnt. ,teenmom,dgf86l8,4,t5_2uw5s
