1543749,0,t3_2bg60b,I took all   level classes and Calc II at the same time and I made an A in all of them except for computer orgshe didnt give As. The workload was difficult but not impossible.But I have to ask how are you taking Calc I amp II at the same time? Have you talked to the Math department about this? Also did you get a waiver to take  hours? If you think you know enough Calc I to handle Calc II right off the bat you should consider taking the Calculus CLEP test which will give you full credit. However if you dont think you can pass the Calc I CLEP test youre going to have a hard time in Calc II. I cant stress enough that I wouldnt take Calc I and II at the same time the home work for both of those classes is going to take more time than you think even if you already know the material. Additionally there were plenty of people in both classes that had already covered the material in high school but still had a really tough time on the tests.Computer Org is potentially difficult depending on the teacher. I know one of the PhD students who taught it a few semesters ago and a very high percentage of students failed his class but my teacher was pretty lenient. The material can be difficult depending on your exposure to the concepts but the main difficulty is the time it takes to do the assignments. I find assembly language kind of fun but it can be very tedious. Plus the assignments have to be done on the departments sparc server which can mess up you work flow and make things take longer than they should.System Level also depends completely on whos teaching. Several of my friends had a grad student and the class was a joke according to them. I had a full professor and it was most definitely not a jokeout of a class of about  people I was the only one who got more than a  average on the homework. Prior exposure to unix and c will help you a lot in this class.Data structures is usually only taught by Bhola. The material isnt that difficult but if you dont know how to program by the time you take this class youll be hurting. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to do the assignments. And make sure you document the crap out of your code.As for  I wouldnt recommend taking that class at all. It doesnt really count for anything for a CS major except as a general elective and youre not really going to learn anything. If you really want to learn web programming Id suggest building something on your own or taking the  level web programming class.Overall Id say your schedule could end up close to impossible from a time management perspectivedepending on your professors and your prior exposure to the material.,GaState,cj9s6uu,2,t5_2s6ds

I didnt worry about getting a health informatics certificate or whatever it is they offer. Employers dont give a fuck about your concentration. Intern in the industry you want to be in then you have a huge leg up applying for entry level jobs. Then you do entry level for a year and tack on two years of intern experience and youre applying for nonentry level jobs. In my case Im two years out of college with  years of relevant work experience. And those were all paid internships. Dont ever do unpaid. As someone who reviews resumes I dont take unpaid internships seriously at all. Youll get paid at least  bucks an hour for hooking up computer monitors. Hope that helps. ,GaState,d3arosc,0,t5_2s6ds
