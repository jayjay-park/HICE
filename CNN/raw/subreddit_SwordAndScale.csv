8282621,0,t1_d3z66gl,Thanks for the recommendation Halfway through the first episode. Ive been trying to find a new podcast to pass the quiet days at work.,SwordAndScale,d5cvxvm,4,t5_2yyg2
8611342,0,t1_d6hwaik,I thought he would know better. I can hear Mikes own voice talking about the tragic events that led up to the senseless killing a family on their way home while he drove drunk. Too bad I used to love the podcast. ,SwordAndScale,d6i0j3d,4,t5_2yyg2

10055624,0,t3_5iawkz,I hated how he said I could never do this job because he had a deep human sense of empathy or something. He said this right to the guy who had that job for years. Pretty sure that guy has a deep human sense of empathy as well and its not just the legendary Mike Boudet,SwordAndScale,dbi9t6p,3,t5_2yyg2

10579822,0,t1_dd77z93,Scaredycast.com is the spot. Pop culture paranormal podcast. Talking ghosts true crime bigfoot etc. And whatever else we kind of rant about. Episodes are recorded and uploaded every Thursday night. Open to any and all feedback. Our audio isnt amazing but we just got all new equipment so it should be better sounding from here on out. ,SwordAndScale,dd785v6,3,t5_2yyg2
10986554,0,t3_5wvguv,Saw the title and thought this would be a thread discussing last weeks garbage episode. They hour spent describing the dark web has already been done before on several different podcasts. All for what so he could describe the uncorroborated details of the murder of  babies for  minutes?  Very very very boring episode with almost no substance. Edit typo,SwordAndScale,dedahlm,14,t5_2yyg2

11504425,0,t1_dg001n6,No its because he started to get paid a shit ton of money for minimal work and he got complacent. ,SwordAndScale,dg00zf9,7,t5_2yyg2
11569844,0,t1_dg7fwpi,Thanks for the suggestions Im actually on episode  of crime town right now and Im taking a break from case file I listened to way too many too fast but for the most part the rest of those are all new to me. ,SwordAndScale,dg7g4af,1,t5_2yyg2
