They downplayed the hell out of that in season  and  in the hopes that people wouldnt realize the massive plothole of but that can be fixed with money which has just led to a lot of annoying situations like this.At the beginning of the season when Beckett was with the FBI why couldnt Castle just rent a fucking suite in DC and stay with Beckett there?,CastleTV,chgoy0w,5,t5_2scog

Its hard to believe that some ordinary character whom weve hardly had more than a couple minutes glimpse at is capable of resorting to mass murder to in Becketts words what drive a nicer car? . An unnecessary twist it was.

There are something like  current Senators with  previous experience including comedian and SNL alum Al Franken.  Public persona is enough to get people elected.  Astronaut John Glenn left NASA and became a senator for more than two decades.  Schwarzenegger Jesse Ventura Clint Eastwood and Sunny Bono all held some form of political office.

5240766,0,t3_3ms2w6,Couple things.  First stepmother?  Unexpected but Im really glad she surfaced.  Castles father is not to be trifled with and with this new guy being a CIA analyst should make for some juicy episodes later on.  Hopefully see some nice ass kicking later on.Speaking of ass kicking that gunspringshoot thing was freaking awesome.  No hesitation just BAM!  I know Rick is usually portrayed as a dude that cant fight but occasionally he gets moments like these.  Finally Beckett drives me insane.  Look the stepmother laid it all out LET IT GO and you can live happily ever after.  But no now we have another self destructive obsession that will likely get more people killed.  Bracken is gone literally this time not just locked up.  I really love this show but if her stubborn self gets Espo or Ryan killed going to have to write this off.Despite all that I liked the episode hell of a way to start the season.,CastleTV,cvhpah5,24,t5_2scog

They made a previous awesome character into a bratty entitled princess who respected no one. Now theyve got no direction still so shes side kick who is a better cop than cops a better PI than PIs and pretty much knows everything about everything. I wish my senior year was as easy as hers seems to be.Its really not Alexis its the lack of character development and rounded writing for the character.

7624391,0,t3_4jpc9z,. The Hollywood Reporter wrote an article on the finale saying that the original ending was supposed to be a cliffhanger of the two lying on the floor bleeding out.  They shot the last sequence for insurance of a cancellation.. As someone in the videofilm production industry I would say that there is almost no possible way to coordinate prep shoot edit and color another sequence of that magnitude in just four days.  At this point the director director of photography producers etc. are working on new things and are already scheduled most likely.  Renting gear and day hands for the actual shoot would be a nightmare as well.  It takes a lot of time and preparation even for just five shots or so. ,CastleTV,d38upaq,6,t5_2scog
