157650,0,t3_1vtz0c,If by PvE you mean dungeon then no theres no build which is good for both. Dungeons require high DPS and no passive defense whereas in WvW high toughnessvitalityhealing power are a must. As you can see the two are quite incompatible.Anyway in general current WvW guardian builds use staffhammer or staffgreatsword and tend to take Pure of Voice Altruistic Healing TwoHanded Mastery and Strength in Numbers then they go for shouts mostly or sometimes consecrations armor can be Clerics Soldier or even Knights sometimes. PvE builds go full berserkers swordfocus as the main set and spam blinds with Blind Exposure trait plus Justice is Blind Fiery Wrath and Renewed Justice as the core traits.,GuildWars2Builds,cewdzl9,1,t5_2tsz8
201652,0,t1_cf1cpur,MaceWarhorn is a lot of fun. But before that let me try to pitch why you should use longbowSkills  Meh two arrows fair damage triggers  for combo finisher.  has a great spread up close itll hit one target three times and causes burning  does great damage and its an AoE   is an aoe blind hits nearby enemies of your target   hits for bleedimmobilize great utility. Longbows burst ability Combustive Shot is amazing. At max adrenaline which youll have all the time with this build if you run  shouts it drops a huge AoE fire field allowing for various combo finishers for allies and yourself! You can do something like this. Get max adrenaline. Use Combustive Shot. Use longbow  ability grant area might. . Drop your Warbanner in it grant area might.. Grab your banner use  grant area might. . Switch to Hammer. Use all  shouts. . Now with max adrenaline use Earthshaker hammer F grant area might. And AoE stun for  seconds.Give it a fair chance some time. Now back to MaceWarhorn. I ran MaceWH with Longbow for a long while. It basically allows for permanent weakness on a target or more if theyre clumped together. It also pairs well with your traits you can sub out Shrug it Off for Quick Breathing and now your warhorn skills convert a condition to a boon on yourself and allies. With  shouts thatll give you  abilities that deal with conditions. AND it they all trigger for your allies too. Also having  more interrupts is always nice. I believe Longbow is capable of far more damage. But MaceWH provides more support for your team. So its up to you really. Both options are good just pick whichever suits your playstyle. ,GuildWars2Builds,cf1esyp,2,t5_2tsz8
220198,0,t1_ceymnv4,Thieves can get away with running full zerker gear in WvW and thats actually a fairly common choice. Ive been doing that for a good while. Once you have that you can just alternate your build between PvE and WvW as needed. On a Thief you can run a WvW build in Dungeons as well and just be slightly less optimal on the DPS side of things. I mostly only run CoF and I dont reset my build for it  just swap out weapons as appropriate for the part of the dungeon Im in and one or two utilities as needed. It works well enough and out DPSs most PUGs.,GuildWars2Builds,cf3iyew,1,t5_2tsz8

352930,0,t1_cfhcehc,Dont delete the pieces if you do change over. The pieces can be quite good in wvw if you do it of course with a staff build since the water fields heal quite a bit. Healing rain  a couple blasts is enough for a full heal. ,GuildWars2Builds,cfhck0i,2,t5_2tsz8

695073,0,t3_22321z,I totally feel your pain as a mesmer in PvE. I love the idea of being a confusion master but unfortunately most enemies dont attack frequently enough to really get the full use of confusion at best youll probably get a couple ticks of damage off before the duration ends.Ive also played mesmer since launch and Im nowhere near the best but Ive played with a lot of builds some meta and some my own and Ive found a couple that generally work for me. The first one is a phantasm build Basically the general idea is to keep your phantasms alive to dish out a lot of damage along with your own. Keep them alive until the skills recharge shatter for another burst and to get a few stacks of might on yourself blurred frenzy resummon repeat. You have good sustain and then an excellent burst sequence.Second is the typical shatter build With cooldown on greatsword sword and illusion summoning skills mirror images decoy and deceptive evasion youll constantly have enough clones up to immediately use mind wrack when it comes off cooldown dealing four extremely powerful hits every  seconds not to mention throwing in some of your other shatters as needed. In this case Cry of Frustration isnt all that useful since not only is confusion underpowered in PvE but youre not built for condition damage.These are more for roaming and casual PvE Im sure there are much better meta builds for dungeonsfractals but Ive really enjoyed using both these builds on my mesmer out in the open world. I know they dont really improve on the condition spec that youd love but theyre extremely fun from my experience!,GuildWars2Builds,cgja5jm,2,t5_2tsz8
712911,0,t3_20r795,Tank is usually defined as being able to take a lot of damage mitigate damage hold aggro or basically keep damage way from your party.In GW the closest you can get to that is figuring out a way to spam weakness chill blind CC knowing those are less effective against bosses which is where you want to keep damage away from party members.If you really really really really did I mention really want to do something like a tank look at hammer mace and their ability to apply weakness.Look at warhorn. Warhorn gives swiftness to you and allies but people forget it also gives Vigor. Vigor increases endurance regen so you can dodge more. Apply it to your party. You can even trait it so that it will transform conditions into boons. Warhorn also applies weakness to enemies.Dont underestimate swiftness. Swiftness modifies many skills and just makes walking through a mob slightly faster for sidestepping a big attack for example.Warhorn also removes chill cripple and immobilize which can save an ally in a tight spot.In fact Ill just leave it at warhorn. If you want to help your team mitigate damage get warhorn and quick breathing. Follow the usual zerker meta for the rest. Youll be a mobility warrior. You keep your party on their feet and ready to dodge or deal damage.I suggest axe main with warhorn and greatsword on second set. The fast hands trait to make it all go smoothly. Quick breathing. Rest the usual as much damage as possible.Use GS for mobility a b here and there. Use axe for damage on Axe Axe for vuln which helps party deal more damage and axe to cripple enemies including bosses. People tend to stack but sometimes a cripple is fun.,GuildWars2Builds,cglb7a7,1,t5_2tsz8
867653,0,t3_23w6ld,Im sorry i cant find an answer that exactly meets your request so here are the closest ones because as long as you are invisible you dont deal damage. Therefore it is useless to go for a dps build based on invisibility but other advantages apply. Highest dps chain you can do incorporates cloak and dagger for an immediate backstab after every full autoattack chain but you usually do this with  or . No points in stealth traits as its all about damage stuns and buffs.As most dungeons reward aoedps and evasion you might want to have a look at a swordpistol build the ones i just mentioned for dualdagger also work as sword dpsbuilds. if you want to play safer put points into acrobatics. Stealth does not benefit swordpistol and vice versa.Lastly builds that make use of stealth traits like the new damage reduction or your healing capabilities tend to be pistoldagger condition builds. Those arent really good for dungeon speedruns but can be nice for pugging. ,GuildWars2Builds,ch2wns0,1,t5_2tsz8

Permanent  crit bonus in DS with additional Ferocity and Life Force as well is the easy and obvious choice over  seconds of fury. ,GuildWars2Builds,ci372dl,3,t5_2tsz8

1775007,0,t3_2etkpe,If youre using daggers then youre probably roaming and it isnt a good idea to max either. Healing power doesnt scale well and maxing out vitality will leave you with mediocre numbers in every other area. For tanking purposes this isnt too bad but then the main uses of an ele arent fully taken advantage of. Your job in a havoc group is to stack might for yourself and allies depending on runes and sigils you will achieve between  mightYou are also a source of condi removal for allies using cleansing wave water X and dodge rolls in water attunement with evasive arcana arcana XIFinally You are to be a nuisance to your opposition a  or  ele still soaks damage well while dishing it out. When maxing earth you get the choice of maxing arcana or water and I feel that any ele build using daggers should have at least  in water  in arcana. Full tank should be left to warriors and guardians,GuildWars2Builds,ck2w7qe,1,t5_2tsz8
1868439,0,t3_2fzpqj,From a warrior who is non Meta and has been stuck using Cleansing Ire in every build as I just cant seem to get away from condi clears in PVE or WvW I like the new Sigil of Cleansing.  I have never been a huge fan of shake it off so cleansing Ire had filled that role but now with the changes to Brawlers Recovery I can no go more power.The build I am currently using is  and I have put the new sigil on my rifle this allows one condi removal every  seconds and  condi removal every  due to Fast Hands in the Tactics line.Side note....that new sigil is account bound so dont make  before reading that.....so thought I was gonna make some money haha.,GuildWars2Builds,ckec9mi,1,t5_2tsz8
1956247,0,t3_2h2uyi,It doesnt look too bad. Personally Id switch out scepter for a sword and Healing Breeze for Shelter. Just be aware youre going to lack projectile defense without swapping for consecrations and maybe picking up its trait which wouldnt be hard just take  from Honor to put in Virtues and boom consecrations instead of shouts. From there youre not very far from the meta hammer guardian build.,GuildWars2Builds,ckoxiqd,2,t5_2tsz8

3155700,0,t1_cooqpyh,Im not asking whats the most effective ranger build though but thanks for letting me know. The thing is I dont play GW to be the best or most useful. My gaming philosophy is to have fun and try to play in a unique creative way. I understand that it most likely differs from your own.The reason I posted the build here is to optimize it for supporting a zerg. Ive tried my best but my limited game knowledge probably causes me to miss out on some great opportunities to make the build better at what it does. Are there any gear specs or traits that would allow me to further increase my heal per second? Or give me more utility as a support? If you could answer any of these questions that would be the greatest help!Thanks for your answer though I dont mean to be rude or salty in any way.,GuildWars2Builds,cop33zz,1,t5_2tsz8
3158458,0,t3_2w8yk5,You wont get big heal numbers out because this game does not support healing in that sense. You will get regen all over the place but regen is a weak buff in a zerg context and has poor scaling. Permaswiftness sounds nice except you will already have it from all the Guardians. Heres the biggest problem though this spec requires a major trait  minor traits and a utility slot to get  lowvalue buffs with  uptime. Thats far too high of a cost.If you want to support your team in wvw you are better off using a spirit build. Stone Spirits protection is miles better than regen which you can still give out via Healing Spring  projectile finishers. Plus you get full functionality with only spending a minor and a major trait.Finally your build lacks condition clear. I s uggest Empathic Bond as big bears Shake it Off will not be sufficient due to its cooldown and cast time.My first toon was a ranger and is still my primary pve toon. I saw the same thing in the trait combo and tried it but the above is why i moved on. ,GuildWars2Builds,copdejh,2,t5_2tsz8

We dont have a consistent line up for WvW raids and people play what they want. I dont know what our necros are running or even if we have them consistently. Really I know virtually nothing about the class.  It is a good point though and something i will keep in mind when its my turn to lead.I am using Melandru now and I have  Hoelbrak with the armor set  already made Im just waiting on accumulating enough gold.

3995803,0,t3_362uq5,Not very good.Youre set up for condi damage but dont have the condi gear.Looks like you like power build more than condi. Id just try a pure power build for fun. They are pretty easy to make.If you like doing condi and power damageVIII V VIIII VI XIIWith Staff Sigil of Fire and Sigil of Air groups kill stuff too fast to get bigger numbers than these with this build. Other builds yes this one no.And ScepterWarhorn or dagger Sigil of Bleeding and Sigil of Agony usually people will call this absolute blasphemy. One does not EVER equip Warhorn and you can pick dagger if you want to but I prefer the Warhorn. You have power and when you are in Death Shroud all of those little bugs have a high crit rate and if you cast insect swarm switch to staff and then get into Death Shroud those little bug crits can cause lightning and fire blasts. Plus having a daze is nice. You can pick dagger if you want but its rare for a condi build to get such a fun weapon to use and dagger will do you no good in Death Shroud or Lich Form. you can cast this before entering either.Basically for this build you want to condi stuff up refill your life force with staff and then DS while things are still condid up and do decent power damage while melting face.Anyhoo good luck.,GuildWars2Builds,crbr6is,1,t5_2tsz8

I ran around with this in HoT though Im probably going to adjust a few things for my dragon hunter guard shes full glass DPS at the moment but I do have a DH tank build in mind that I want to try out on my second guard. is the gist of it.  Between fragments of faith trait for a second FoF retreat shield of courage and shield  thats a crapload of aegis on demand a knockback from shield for running around HoT mace is awesome DPS along with really good symbol up time when swapping back and forth between GS and maceshield.
