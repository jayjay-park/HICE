1520665,0,t3_2bmqln,If the referendum failed in  then they do have a sort of a ban. They cant just say that the dog ate our homework. Laws represent reality not the other way around...It would of been different if they had discovered this before they held a referendum but now they are cursed with a type of terrible political knowledge. The only way to change that knowledge is to have another referendum. There is a reason that professional politicians hate referendums. Its because of crap like this...,Manitoba,cj6w56s,1,t5_2r8t6

As well the health card information will be accessible from the cardholders smartphone or tablet using an app that will serve as a virtual card  a first of its kind in Canada Mackintosh said.So now you have an app for that.And I believe your current cards will still be good until they expire but after that your new card will be one of these new cards.And I agree more and more places now have all my information instead of just a bit of it whatever happened to compartmentalization? ,Manitoba,cyujsgr,1,t5_2r8t6
