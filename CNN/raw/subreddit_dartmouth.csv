7472040,0,t1_d2qmilx,Lol Im not Corey Alexander. Also it was  schools Dartmouth Duke Stanford that were my top  and I didnt get into them. Theyre schools with a lot in common so its not really strange that Id like all of them. And if you read them youd see that I only called one of them my first choice and that was Dartmouth!Just wanted to learn about how transfer students fare at DartmouthDukeStanford because Im beginning to plan for the transfer admissions process right now. Any info would definitely be welcomed!,dartmouth,d2riyk4,0,t5_2rc20
