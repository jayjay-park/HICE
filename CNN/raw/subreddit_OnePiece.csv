My understanding was that the real threat from Ace was his ability to be a symbol that could upset the status quo not his actual power level. Marco is scary powerful but being higher ranked than Ace would require he be even bigger than that and bounties have yet to go THAT ridiculously high.

66757,0,t1_cem0yxw,Brook was easily defeated by Ryuuma who was holding back the majority of his strength. It was basically just a setup for Zoros fight. I dont think you can really count it. His fight with the squid guy on Fishman island is his only real fight in the series. And that guy was severely outclassed by Brook. Not exactly an intense fight that pushed the limits of his ability.Franky has fought that rookie CP agent and Fukuro and thats about it. Baby  and Buffalo were no challenge for him even together and it wasnt exactly a normal fight either since Franky was in the Shogun.Senor Pink will probably be Frankys first real fight since Fukuro.Robin has basically had as many fights as Franky. Although she usually ends them without a scratch. She beat Pell Taishigi and the Skypiea commander guy relatively easily.Trust me I want an intense  on  fight featuring Robin as much as anyone but we dont necessarily need a new female fighter when theres already someone perfectly capable of fulfilling that role on the crew.I wouldnt be opposed to a new female fighter joining if she fit in well but I dont think its necessary.,OnePiece,cem13h0,5,t5_2rfz5

154482,0,t3_1vqe95,And yet another AMV for me to review... mmm.All around I really like this AMV. The editing is very strong amongst the better ones Ive seen. Footage quality is good too.One of my bigger disappointments was the story it tries to explain  I couldnt really keep my attention on it but that might just have been me. Rewatching it a second time got the story across better I probably would have caught on completely if I hadnt had some IRL factors bugging me for my attention while I watched. Still a lot of the action and animation seem to have relatively little to do with the story so I dont feel completely horrible at having lost track first time around.There is a transition in music around  which somewhat saddened me. It somehow managed to feel forced or out of place while none of the other transitions really went noticed by me. The music as a whole appealed to me though part because I didnt know it and part because it fit the AMV pretty well.As I said before the editing is good qualitywise. It has a weakness though and that is consistency. In the start it has this somewhat scifiish look. Later on it has sliding doors with monochrome. And theres plenty of other effects too. While a lot of it meshed well with the music the AMV as a whole seemed to be all over the place with regards to the effects and transitions chosen... which is probably a shame. Another AMV I reviewed a few days ago had far better consistency in that sense.My rating is probably around a . maybe an .I look forward to seeing more work from this dude. ,OnePiece,cew0zam,1,t5_2rfz5

The most popular theory and one I agree with is that Corasan was a mentor figure to Law and the Heart Seat of the Doflamingo Pirates. Doflamingo killed Cora for whatever reason and Law has wanted revenge ever since. He sets out  years later.Up next is Drake. We see as a child he looked up to the Marines. So something must have happened  years ago for him to disband and become a pirate. He either had a realization that the Marines werent the good guys like Saul did or he found out something hidden.Bonney may be a lot older than she appears. Oda says she appears  years old which suggest shes actually quite older. She cries when Whitebeard is stabbed and chases Blackbeard down when he kills Whitebeard. So Bonney seems to be on good terms with Whitebeard and may even be  years or older. We also know that the Government had captured her. She probably escaped two years ago to be a pirate.Urouge is from Bilka which was destroyed by Enel  years ago. Its not specified whether he had left Bilka before or after it was destroyed.Kid Hawkins Apoo Bege havent hinted at anything but who knows for sure.EDIT Looks like I read the thread slightly wrong. As for what theyve been doing the last two years we know that Drake has decided to work under an Emperor while Kid is trying to take Big Mom down. Bonney and Law have been laying low for a while now.,OnePiece,cex7pjq,18,t5_2rfz5
165312,0,t1_cex8sd2,PH isnt the same I dont think. The reason why the whole island got changed was because they were fighting for so long. It wasnt necessarily that they could cover the whole island with their power at once.WB is probably closest to that level of range to his ability from what we see but even then his earthquakes are localized fairly close to himself. When he does the tsunami its not that hes quaking the whole sea its just a big shock that he sets out from where he is standing which then causes it on the backlash. Enel also has considerable range but its localized as well he can only strike a certain sized location with his lightning at any given moment though he can use the bolts almost anywhere. But that could be him moving at lightning speed to the area over where he wants to smite someone hes got mantra to tell exactly where they are.Though it is possible I guess. Im unsure now.

Well almost definitely learn more about it later whenever it becomes relevant.  Its actually one of the things Ive been dying to know about most since then haha.,OnePiece,cfdkjcc,12,t5_2rfz5

The world government flag shows four circles feeding into a single circle which obviously means the four seas. The world government maintains control through its brutality and by dividing and conquering the oceans which segregates the people of the world. Furthermore the world government does all this at the behest of the world nobles. All of this is done to protect and enrich the world nobles who occupy the center of this great organization.In other words they make their money by restricting freedom and the protections they offer tend to be rather limited compared to the tribute they require.

618119,0,t1_cgah8no,gt I think that while Shanks does not maintain a sneaky network of information it would be odd to assume he doesnt pay attention to the rumbles in the underworld that Oda has already shown us. I think its possible that such important information would leak to the underworld and the Yonko would learn it from there.I think Shanks might keep track of an underbelly gossip mill but I dont think he has a spy network. The Pluton stuff was very likely too localized and sensitive for anyone but a dedicated spy to find out about. It was Enies Lobby inside the Cipher Pol Nine homebase a.k.a. the Tower of Justice. Not many Marines would have had access into that place!gt Im not sure how showing the execution of Ace alone would have been that useful since wasnt Ace supposed to have been killed during the slaughter of babies for over a year postRogers death?Nope. It was a mere rumor  conjecture that Roger might have a child the only Marine who had actual proof hed had a child was Garp who was clearly morally troubled by the affair. The two years they spent looking for babies was a fruitless effort every preggers woman got double and triplechecked for as far her possibly knowing Roger went. In the end it was publically considered a groundless myth and only in the last few years after Ace started up his Spade Pirates did he end up catching the watchful eye of the World Government who immediately realized who he was... sadly Whitebeard beat them to the punch. The public was unaware at this point however letting the world know Roger had a child that was still freely roaming the ocean was the last thing the WG wanted to come out.,OnePiece,cgaj4nx,0,t5_2rfz5

638650,0,t1_cgc92ow,gtI dont mind Usopps fights being funny in fact thats why I love them but the outcome of this battle had absolutely nothing to do with his intelligence or talent. It was just dumb luck.I actually really liked it it was very original. As for the intelligence and talents man that sounds to me like this idea in this subreddit that I never stop finding surprsing. That the focus of the story is the characters developing learning how to cope with the harsh real world or learning a moral code or battle experience. I just find it impossible to believe that Oda has this kind of thing as a priority.The archetype of the story aside from the Alice in Wonderland stuff  the pirate romanticism which both fit with how the battle went on is like in Westerns or the Seven Samurai. A group of powerful and usually flawed one way or the other outsiders seeking a long term goal outside that of the current plot end up in a place where the innocent and weak are in a dire situation aginst the strong and they just help them out of pure kindness. And its about breadth each one of the group has a different style or theme often one of them will just win by persistance and luck as in the universe will conspire to make it happen .

And why cant one hand hold down one stream? And why are we assuming the enemy also has CoC Haki? This makes no sense to me at all...Haki from what I understand is just a manifestation of your willpower.When someone with Conquerors Haki knocks someone unconscious its because they overpowered their will. Which is why it doesnt seem to work on other strongwilled people. Because their will is strong enough to resist it and thus remain conscious.But I think its possible that it still has an effect on people with stronger wills. It just isnt as dramatic because they can resist it better.,OnePiece,cgdypq3,1,t5_2rfz5
648425,0,t1_cgdyqiv,gtSmoke screen would still be effective in stopping Trebol from interfering. Sleeping gas too. He was the real threat to the fight.Were making a lot of assumptions about Trebols abilities but I admit thats partly the fault of Oda for not showing the fight. Maybe well see Trebol more since I dont think Trebol will be surviving the Dressrosa arc.gtSugar is only difficult in close range something that a sniper should really not have too much trouble with.But Sugar is clearly faster than the Tontattas and the Tontattas can move faster than what Usopp and Robin can see with their bare eyes. I think Sugar can easily outrun anything Usopp snipes and then close in on Usopp to turn him into a toy. That is unless youre arguing that Sugar only has fast arms but not feet which is weird but not unlikely. People in One Piece have a tendency to skip leg day when they work out.gtWhat was the point in showing Trebol having flammable whateverthehellhisunclearLogiais?To show us that Trebol is powerful or to set it up for a future fight because I dont think trebol is going to survive the Dressrosa arc.But you still havent given me your thought on why Trebol didnt explode even though he was standing in very close proximity to the explosion that defeated the Tontattas.gtThe fact that the Tontattas ultimate weapon was in the form a pellet was a clear sign where this fight should have gone.No that was fan making up theories Oda is under no obligation to do what the fans think would be better. Besides Sugar is not stupid and as I said shes faster than Usopps eyes which is a problem for snipers. Snipers cannot snipe what they cant see unless they have observation haki which Usopp doesnt.gtWere given a character that isnt too bright acts rashlygtPeoples constant counter argument is that Trebol was too physically strong for Usopp. The same can be said for Chew Mr.  or Perona. Yet Usopp still found a way to surpass them without being physically superior. Thats the whole charm to Usopps fights. And with the examples Ive listed above its completely in the realm of possibility that Usopp could have gotten past Trebols defenses and knocked Sugar out.So you think Usopp should have defeated Luffy because its part of Usopps charm to surpass dumb people who are physically superior to him?gtLike it or not this is a missed opportunity in giving Usopp a cool fight which hasnt happened in over  years. I agree I want to see the fight too but I dont think Usopp couldve won especially since its  versus .gtI hope that hilarious face was worth it.Im interested in all the toys who swore allegiance to Usopp and the fact that Usopp acted brave. The hilarious face was unexpectedly hilarious but we cannot say it came out of no where because it was foreshadowed.

739003,0,t3_22lnk6,Birdcage seems specific to Law as all of doflamingos subordinates seem surprised hes still alive including gladus whos an executive. I think this is where law comes into play and why doflamingo specifically addresses Law when he says it. Building on the idea that Law is involved or the cause of birdcage then I think Birdcage is named based on how a birdcage is constructed. Consider a bird cage like this Its a couple of rings Strung together by the vertical metal wires. Like myself and others have speculated is that Law has cut doflamingo before into pieces. This would allow his weaker paramecia fruit to mimic the more powerful logia fruit as hes immune to blades because Law has cut him into as small as pieces as possible and with Doflamingos string fruit he strung all the pieces together. We know that the pieces Law cuts remain detached outside of room because of kinaemon so if doflamingo could reattach all these pieces then I think thats what birdcage is.,OnePiece,cgoa1w0,5,t5_2rfz5

800173,0,t1_cgv1qa8,I will have to disagree with you and pretty much the rest of you it would seem that all that growth that we saw during Paradise was nothing but a change in art style or other changes that Oda decided to make we cant forget that from the beginning of the series up to the TS not even a year had passed.I was pretty surprised too I mean taking from our world where sailing would normally take weeks or months I too thought that the SHs were indeed aging but we cant really say that. This only became evident to me when Shanks came to end the war at Marineford and Lucky Roo asked him if he wanted to see Luffy that they had not seen for  years.So to answer the question no I dont think we will see the SHs age at least that much. I mean if the first half a little more than half if we count East Blue took less than a year I dont count on the second half to take much more than that.

803842,0,t1_cgvkhxy,I feel like Luffy was more angry with Akainu than Blackbeard after aces death. To me ace dying was more for luffy to mature and wake up to realise he cant get by relying solely on his own power. If shanks does die it would be more to push him to becoming stronger than Blackbeard and in doing so become one of or the strongest pirates. Killing of every red hair pirate would be a bit much. This reply got me thinking about Yasopp teaching Usopp and maybe thats how he would stop being so afraid. Maybe all he wanted was his strong father to acknowledge and have pride in him.Thanks for the reply ,OnePiece,cgvnf61,2,t5_2rfz5

827056,0,t1_cgy8rot,gtsanji didnt. franky arguably didnt. brook probably didnt. bibi didnt. zoro didnt really either except for the death of kuina.Sanji and Zoro both appear to be orphans. You could argue that Sanji meeting Zeff and almost starving to death was an overall positive thing in his life but it would have been a pretty horrifying experience while it happened. Frankys mentorbasically his father got killed because of his own inventions and then he got hit by a trainwhich of course he made the most of by becoming a cyborg. Brooks childhood was probably fine but he certainly has one of the most tragic pasts. It just happened as an adult.All of them at the very least have some tragic event in their past.,OnePiece,cgyadec,7,t5_2rfz5
828075,0,t3_23m0v1,gt But I say Sanji because he really does need some lots more development sure his past was bad but in comparison to everyone else on the crew? The crew would be in shock that one of their  monsters have been left crippled and more importantly we can get to see how Sanji reacts to this and he gets plenty of time to be developed. First of all I really dont understand your point of view at all. Can you explain how you came up with this idea cause Ive seen it mentioned in this subreddit a couple dozens of times and imo I have a feeling that it happened in X novel  tv series  manga and people want to see it in One Piece.And I dont think that One Piece is either decidedly lighthearted or aims to have characters that develop by going through tragedies. Man Ive been watchingreading One Piece since  I cant believe its been like  years now and only recently Ive seen people asking for that or being under the impression that One Piece is about that. And I attribute it to recent tv shows like GoT Breaking Bad etc.The theme in One Piece isnt people maturing developing and getting strong enough to face the real world. Its almost like the opposite. Its fuck the real world. Think about it every time they face a new villain in a  new story arc he always comes off as an authoritative figure and he often is like this is the real world I make the rules. And to add insult to injury often the damsel in distress seems to agree see ArlongCP and how Nami and Robin both implicitly or explicitly urged Luffy to run for his live as in he wasnt a realist enough to handle the situation. But thats the theme of One Piece they travel around a situation like that emerges and when they get this kind of dillema they march in and fuck everything up. They dont need no personal drama or their legs getting cut off to keep doing this.  ,OnePiece,cgyejoj,21,t5_2rfz5

It means that no matter how big your army is its irrelevant unless its filled with people stronger than he is and if it was you wouldnt have a problem beating him to begin with. CoC is huge. Not having to worry about ANYONE below a certain power level is huge in a manga centered on pirate crews and very little is based on on battles. Luffys strength is on so CoC lets him only worry about that one guy he needs to beat which is perfect for Luffy.

Everything during that arc was slow tedious a lot of dumb halfwitted strictly for plot decisions were made by characters. All the characters felt dumb looked dumb Rhino necks gt packs no eyebrows and it just ruined the whole thing for me.If the whole arc was more sudden if there was even a fight put up by either side and cinematography sound design was just done better overall to make the whole arc just a spectacle of wonder I wouldnt have minded all the tiny mistakes or new interpretations of the characters.Fucking Hiluluks death meant more to me than Aces because Aces character at that point was just doomed to die anyway. He lived like a pirate didnt want to see change or accomplish a bigger more important task he was a strong character who could put up a fight he was a disposable pirate with the way he was portrayed.The only reason it would be sad is because its sad for Luffy and at that time Luffy didnt really feel at all like Luffy. I could understand there being a difference in his tone for seriousness since this is his brother being executed but...Its just too much to explain. The tone his gestures posture face body language overall behavior and character design did not portray the Luffy Ive been seeing for fucking hundreds of episodes now. In fact I wonder how THAT Luffy wouldve reacted to this whole thing about Aces death.But that arc just felt wrong. I wanted to care but I couldnt because it felt like I didnt know any of the characters even the ones weve been seeing for hundreds of episodes up till now.,OnePiece,chau7eg,2,t5_2rfz5
941063,0,t3_24vepn,Disregard the following the comment if you were not asking for constructive criticism. Since you left it pretty open I am choosing to interpret it as CC but I know how reddit reacts to varying opinions at timesTo start off I love what you did with what I am assuming is pen. It even look like it could be ballpoint. I need to know what you you used because I have started moving to the pen medium restricting myself to ballpoint pens to see what I can come up with. From there I want to mention your form is a bit lost and taking a look at your other work it kind of moves towards your style. I am not sure if you were aware of that but since this seems to be a duplication of Odas work you may want to work on that.There is some stiffness to your work but it is so hard to judge this since the character is drawn to be something like a stalking maniacal villain. The hands of mingo are a bit rendered more than I think they should be. Too much attention is pulled to his left hand whereas the body has all these interesting patterns and designs. This leads to my next favorite part of your style your shadow rendering. It is just phenomenal! Your cross hatching on the main body is just great. You put just enough not to pull away the attention of the viewer and and my eyes just follow it real well. I just do not like how I keep glancing over the hand which just detracts from the work you put into the body. I think that is mostly the problem. Your hand lost a lot of the crosshatching style you incorporated and it obtained low value areas that keeps pulling my eyes to that area. To finish this up the forehead seems a bit bulbous or it protrudes too much and your hands are a bit weird but I think it is just an experience things. Hands and feet are so hard to draw!Great drawing I will definitely be interested in seeing more of your future work!EDIT I just took a look at your Zoro drawing. You really have a style that works well for anime. It reminds me when I did bamboo shoots with ink deep heavy lines. It is very beautiful and pleasing to see. By far one of my more favorite styles and artists on reddit. Cannot wait to see more of your work! ,OnePiece,chb96hx,8,t5_2rfz5
942332,0,t1_ch9vfrq,Magellan is not admiral level. Not even close.I dont think his DF is powerful enough to put him at Admiral level strength. The difference between someone of Luffys caliber and an Admiral is far too much for some Hax to fill the gap. Its not like his DF is THAT broken anyway.Anyone stronger than Vergo could take him down honestly. He had the element of surprise when he took on Teachs crew initially they obviously didnt know about his poison powers or else the fight would have gone much differently. He couldnt have been any stronger than Teach himself if Shiryuu was Mags equal and decided to follow in Teachs footsteps. I doubt that the damage Magellan took earlier was a big factor in later stomping from Teachs crew.,OnePiece,chbedzy,1,t5_2rfz5

I believe it was a conference with all the world leaders but the Tenryuubito would carry the most weight in decisions right? So this leads me to assume that theres at least some Tenryuubito who arent just selfcentered oppressive aholes and actually take their position seriously. If Oda just introduced one like that who had authority over the others like an elder or something the ones weve met were fairly young the group itself could be likable.

1059572,0,t1_chol2ps,gtI doubt Kinemon will join based mostly on him having a kid. I see you said you dont think hes Momos dad and though you make good points Im still skeptical they are VERY similar the pervs and its entirely possible Hes intraining so his dad took him on the mission or he snuck on their ship wanting to prove himself or something.I wouldnt be surprised Samurai in general are just pervy. They live in a much more traditional conservative country and arent used to seeing Skimpy clothes like Nami wears.I doubt theyre training or that he was trying to prove himself. He doesnt seem to have any fighting ability at all. Has he even been shown carrying a sword?And theres still the matter of his suspicious behavior. Why wont he eat food from strangers? Why is Doflamingo so interested in himto the point that hes one of the three cards? Then theres the part where hes playing Shogun and telling Luffy hell be Shogun of WanokuniI cant help but feel like Oda is dropping some huge hints here.gtThe other reasons I doubt Kinemon as a future Strawhat are his honorduty tieing him to Wano Kingdom and stopping him from joining pirates even the Strawhats.That wont be a problem if the Straw Hats help save all of Wanokuni from one of the four emperors. Theyll be seen as heroes. I think it would be quite dishonorable to continue treating your saviors like common criminals.gtAnd the simple fact that I think that would make TOO MANY  Swordsmen on the crew. Even with his Fox Fire it isnt varied enough from Zoro and to a lesser extent Brook. I think hell teach the Fox Fire techniques to Zoro.Kinnemon isnt just a swordsman. He can make disguises for the crewhed basically be the crews tailor. With him on the crew wed have a   and  sword using swordsman and his firefox style would contrast nicely with Brooks ice thing.gtI think hell stay with them until gtA They get to Zou the island his friend and Laws crew are on and then hell leave to complete his mission and meet the Strawhats at Wano laterhell leave with Law either to go home or to further the mission andor deal another blow to Kaido. gtor B and the more likely I think he will continue on after Zou with the Strawhats to the Wano Kingdom I think Kaido will have a big part in the Wano Arc too and hell stay there like Vivi did in Alabasta. It is possible hell be a Vivilike character but I honestly dont think there is a single person introduced in the entire New World more suited to join the crew than Kinnemon.He has a very useful noncombat ability a unique fighting style a quirky and funny personality and he has been traveling with them for a while now and we still dont know that much about him.,OnePiece,choq7i4,1,t5_2rfz5

Physical aesthetics you mentioned his size and that he wouldnt fit in many areas of the ship or when compared to the other Straw Hats but hes actually way smaller than Franky in every way. I think his fashion style is different enough from anyone on the current crew or even anyone that people have been suggesting as possible new recruits. and I feel it should be mentioned that Oda has wanted to add a permanent Fishman crew member to the Straw Hats since like the East Blue and only waited because he chose to do the Arlong Arc instead. as for the fleet admiral stuff there was a discussion a while ago where it was mentioned and I like this that when the next Marineford level event or higher happens possibly the final battle each of the Straw hats would lead a section of the many allies theyve gained over the years probably specialized in a field. It was also noted that this would be where Usopps lie about his highest number of followers would come true. that doesnt have a lot to do with our discussion but i though id mention it.,OnePiece,ci4k0il,1,t5_2rfz5

All the dude lives for is for finding someone who he can fight on the same level as him.Moriah is Sloth since hes so fat and lazy leaving the fighting to his zombies and his own shadow not even standing up to fight with Luffy at the beginning.Doflamingo is Pride being a king and a Celestial Dragon as well as one of the most powerful men in the underworld. He sees himself superior to pretty much anyone going on about how the government has no power over him since could leave the warlords if he so chooses.Jinbe is Envy representing the envy all fishmen have for humanity jealous of them being able to live on the surface in the sunlight.Kuma is Gluttony and is the weakest connection I feel but rather than food its cyborg enhancements. Hes allowed the machine to consume him for science or the revolution of just power we dont know yet. Either way he let this thing overcome him.Kuma also falls under Acedia one of the sins that was replaced by Sloth. describes a state of listlessness or torpor of not caring or not being concerned with ones position or condition in the world. Could be his loss of self after becoming a pasifista. Now a soulless uncaring unthinking machine.But thats just what I think.,OnePiece,ciepv5n,1,t5_2rfz5

1435883,0,t3_2al8c6,I think its a combination of plot needs and suspending our worlds laws of physics.However if you think about it Kizaru cant just use his fruit the way you suggest above. First of all Im betting he has to be able to see where hes going to beam off to. It doesnt make sense that he would be able to effectively teleport to anywhere in the world. If his power is to dematerialize and travel as a mass of light he can probably only do it over short visible distances....even if he IS light I doubt his brain can process his surroundings and adjust movement accordingly while moving at those speeds. Keeping this in mind we can dispel some of Enels advantages namely his speed. Yes when he is in his lightning form he can move at insane speeds. However it still takes him a human amount of time to assume his logia form and react to attacks and the same impediments probably apply to him as they do to Kizaru he probably has to think about where hes going to move to and be able to see it.As for Luffy being able to touch Enel without being burned...this is an instance where we might have to suspend physics. The simple concept behind this is that rubber is an extremely poor conductor of electricity and Oda is merely simplifying this into an elemental advantage. Its just a case where we shouldnt think too deeply. Yes in the real world rubber would burn but the One Piece universe seems to follow a more Pokemonesque interpreations of physics and elemental rockpaperscissors.I would grant you the gripe about magma burning fire that was a stretch.

1528277,0,t3_2bppco,I put my money on Jinbei joining as soon as I read the chapter where Ace asks him to protect Luffy. It just makes sense. Being a member of the Strawhats means more than just being strong likeable good or cool otherwise theyd have a lot more crew members. Everyone fills a roll. So whenever the prospect of someone joining comes up you have to ask yourself what roll they will fill. They have a Captain a vice captainswordsman a cook a musician a navigator a sniper an historian a doctoranimaltranslator and shipwrightengineer. What role would someone like Kinemon fill? None. Hes a really great character and I hope hell stick around for a while but unless he has skills that havent been shown yet he would not add anything to the Strawhats other than power and comedy relief. Jinbei on top of being powerful and wise fills a very necessary role. Just like Chopper is the de facto ambassador for all of the animals Jinbei would be the de facto ambassador to all FishmenFishwomen MermaidsMermen and all underwater animals. That would mean all sentient beings are represented in the Strawhats. On top of that Jinbei would bring all of the perks to being a Fishman. He is most powerful in the water the place where the Strawhats are weakest and he can talk to underwater beings so the Srawhats can now communicate with every single type of animal.

1561348,0,t3_2c40vs,I think they meant they were similar in the sense that they do what they want regardless of what anyone else wants them to. Garp turned down being an admiral protected the pirate kings son he took in Colby and Helmeppo he forces his way on Sengokus ship despite not being included in the mission.  Their selfishness is most likely what they were referring to.  I also don t think Garp was a pirate either.  Remember they were wary of letting Colby join for that reason. I think Garp has a strong sense of justice and has been that way from the start. Thats why he hid Ace thats and thats why hes training Colby.  I think he wanted Ace and Luffy to be Marines to avoid being at odds with them. His own son is the most wanted criminal in the world. That has to hurt. Then the cycle repeated and  he had to be the one to stand between Luffy and Ace.  Lastly assuming Garp knew anything of the traits of D  he wouldve know Luffy and Ace were destined to be powerful trouble makers. Get them while their young bring them to the Marine side and if all goes well he wouldnt need to worry for them. In the end Garp is a big softie that just selfishly does what he wants. ,OnePiece,cjbzkox,1,t5_2rfz5

I prefer manga over anime in general too though so I may be biased.Though you might enjoy both. I avoided the anime for ages but two weeks ago started watching some of it. I watched Funimations season  Enies Lobby and loved it. Now Im watching FishMan Island on Crunchyroll and will watch it up until the current episode.

I was a bit disappointed because I thought he would have made it to an counter Admiral or something like that but on the other hand theres still so much of the story to happen that theres much time left and I feel like it wont last long until he gets promoted again.And if I think about it him being a captain now was actually a big promotion because he basically was a no name in the marine before.  Developing at this rate with Rokushiki Haki and training by Garp is just impressive! And Im sure hell accomplish his dream and become at least an admiral!But honestly I dont think that Helmeppo will ever be strong enough to challenge the SHs at least not Zoro.

Warming up with cardio then going to bicepcurls? What is that gonna help? You warm up your muscle holds and muscle to not tear or strain it.So warming up  Do the muscle exercise but with lower weights and then move to working loads.You eat enough energy to gain mass or you eat little enough to lose mass. The magic is how much moreless you eat in order to gain as much musclemass as you can whilst losing as much fat as possible over a given amount of time. Say  months.As to OP and his dream. Well pray that you have special muscle holds that looks like his as well as some insane genes.

What about Rayleigh?  Theres no doubt that they are exceptionally strong but afaik we dont know when they peaked.Could be that Jinbe has reached  of his potential whereas Sanji is only at  of his.

1997020,0,t1_cktu6j5,Right but that same logic applies to everything in One Piece.Rather my point is that the devil fruit power is specifically limited in this case to make the user heavier or lighter. Similarly Fujitora seems to have a gravity power. Were I to stretch it Id even drag Kizarus light power into this. All of these fruits apply only to their own little niche of the physics spectrum as opposed to some sort of I control the entire world around us power each which leaves it vulnerable in rockpaperscissorsesque ways.Less physicsy but still relevant we have Luffy who struggled with the nature problems of having an entire rubber body that he wasnt fully able to control. Ace struggled with dry materials like straw that easily burn.Once devil fruits are involved depending on the nature of their power they can very much be bound by sensible rules wed see in real life if only to leave them not complete broken in terms of strength.,OnePiece,cktuacv,2,t5_2rfz5

I felt PH ended much more quickly that I wouldve anticipated compared to what I thought when I was halfway into it.

And he was every bit as fast and strong as Lucci in Gear ndwhich he would lost had he not used. He was keeping up just fine with Lucci and your assertion that Lucci was better in all of those ways is baseless since Luffy showed that he was a match for him in Gear .gtThats what kinda amazed me about that fight. Luffy wasnt saving a card up his sleeve. IN FACTgtHe saved up Gear Second and Gear Third and those ideas flopped. Luffy got his ass handed to him in both events.Flopped? How? He won only because he had gear  and .and Soru And they were both very effective.gtAnd that drove home the point that you cant just win with techniques power levels alone.Yes you can. Determination plays some part but not nearly as much as strength. I dont care how determined some fodder Marine is hes not going to beat Luffy in a fist fight.gtSeriously think about it how the fuck did Luffy even beat Lucci?Because Gear  and Soru made their strength and speed much more even.

2199352,0,t3_2k8o77,Well I had a friend who tried like  episodes and was like this is boring. And never kept watching. That One Piece gets good at x doesnt work on him because he doesnt understand why he has to invest more time to get to the interesting parts. Most of my friends believe that its stupid that One Piece is so long and are like when is he going to get one piece? I try to explain to them that the journey is what counts and tell them its a fantastic emotional story. Their response?WTF? Then whats up with the One Piece then? Why is it so long to get there? The art is grotesque too. UGH.People are just impatient and want instant gratification. They all need to read up on Siddhartha or something. Of course I think OP gets better at X works if the person is still somewhat interested in continuing. I mean most of the time people use that argument its with someone asking if they should stick around. And thats usually a sign that they are still willing to continue. So the statement works as a little push in that regard. If people arent open to it then I see no reason to even try to convince them to watch. Theyre just going to miss out on something amazing. Their loss. Sorry this turned out to be a mini rant.... ,OnePiece,clje48r,1,t5_2rfz5

2256968,0,t1_clqobsz,Quite a few people theorize that Rodger had the Gomu Gomu fruit but weve never seen any evidence of this. The only basis they seem to go on is that Shanks supposedly wanted the fruit for some reason. Even that is theory though since its quite possible he would have reacted the same over ANY devil fruit. They are rare finds after all.Personally I think its silly and Oda tends to stray away from repeating history in most cases.. Its not his style. There really is no basis to go on by saying Luffy will have the same illness due to using gear nd ect.. The only reason it was thought dangerous was because it was new and Luffys body was unable to handle the amount of stress it gave out at the time. That has completely changed now. Not only can he activate gear nd over and over without effort but his gear rd no longer shrinks him afterward. He has mastered the two abilities just as other devil fruit users master theirs and unlock new things. They likely all go through a period of struggling due to not being used to the techniques ect. Chopper is another good example of this with his various forms. Pretimeskip he needed rumble balls now he doesnt for most of them. He still has a way to go when it comes to his monster form but that is no different to Luffys gears. He cant move after using it even now does that mean he has an illness? No.Sorry just thought Id point that out.,OnePiece,clqokqf,1,t5_2rfz5

They had to make sure nami and robins post timeskip designs had to have their cleavage as prominent as possible and nami rarely ever wears a shirt over her bra now we cant go  seconds in any scene involving her without having a close up of her boobs. In film Z they have the most cringeworthy shots ever when nami and robin change ages of their asses and tits shrinking or growing it is really not fucking necessary. Was there any point in making Rebeccas tits so fucking big?

2278911,0,t1_cltdt6e,Thanks for the input.Reason why i need this is i am going to attempt to make an unabridged version of the separate arcs into full length movies so to speak with maybe some pause breaks in between where is needed. No offense to the creators but i am sick of waiting for them to do it. It would be for my own personal use anyways. Dont need legal issues. I might need to find people willing to make brand new subs for that. Am hoping though that i can manage to splice the show together properly with subs included without having to remake the subs. So far though i cannot seem to get my encoder of choice to keep the subs in the anime to stay and so i will need to use separate subs to reapply after the work is done.Video specs will be as suchHigh quality video with fps. I would like to use p resolution but will lower that to keep the file size as small as possible without reducing quality as much as possible.

Of course she could tell the grape wasnt really a grape so she might have Observation haki or be really observant which might let her notice.

2513736,0,t1_cmmn86t,I think so.  With any given picture or drawing adding in more objects is not always better as after a certain point it stops looking like a depiction of an event and starts looking like a picture of a hoarders house or a screen from a hidden object game.  That is part of the reason why minimalism has been so popular for decades.For a good example of why I think the first one was better Look at the previous banners or the current one.  The only time any of the banners even have multiple scenes stacked vertically on top of each other is with Frankys and that is just the background with extra focus put on Franky at the center.Remember the banners arent necessarily about showing you every single important scene or person in the characters developmentarcs progression it is about capturing the essence of the characterarc.  For example Luffys banner centers on the things that have shaped him pirate ship treehouse with Ace and Sabo forming his own crew making and keeping some really close friends recovering from a horrific tragedy and moving forward with a smile and a sense of wonder and East Blues banner centers on the atmosphere aside from a few special powers on the strongest pirates it was a very dark arc covering everything from pirates destroying villages for fun and practice and insane Marine captains treating their subordinates like slaves to chemical warfare and child slavery and the dark colors used as the background are perfect for capturing that essence.  Hell Choppers banner doesnt focus on him but on the cherry blossom tree AKA his dreamsideals he just wants to do good things and have people he can call friends and while he was initially easily frightened and hoping to be accepted as normal even after accidentally killing the one man he looked up to most in the world shown on the left side of the tree he is now willing to become a monster if it means that he can help his friends accomplish their dreams shown on the right side of the tree.Getting off that train of thought because thinking of the deeper meanings behind the banners is making me relive the whole series at high speed and I cant type very well while feeling those emotions your second submission also had some things that really seemed to go against the overall color scheme like the purple Robin head and other stuff that just seemed like needless clutter like the image of Crocodile with his hook raised up on the left side.However I think that the submission deadline was December st and the voting thread which was only going to be active for  hours was posted over  days ago so I speaking as a nonmod am not even sure if you could still submit that let alone get enough people to vote for it that it becomes the official banner.,OnePiece,cmmomkv,1,t5_2rfz5

We cant havehimher take away from the plot line of the new strength of the Strawhat crew too much and with the crew split like this it is perfect we are goint to have two different ships going to the same place so give both of them a  episode filler before they meet and Zou it would work just fine.,OnePiece,cmo8987,8,t5_2rfz5

But even though hes terrified hes still willing to get up and fight for his friends. As an example his speech in Alabasta is probably one of the best speechs in the whole series for me cause it shows that yeah hes week and yeah hes a coward but he is just as loyal as any straw hat and he believes so much in luffys dream that even after getting a  ton bat to the face he isnt willing to stay down and let them badmouth his friends dream. To me hes the bravest specifically because hes a coward but is still willing to fight the monsters for his friends.,OnePiece,cmp75sr,2,t5_2rfz5

IIRC they are the only ones to be able to coat their ships with seastone to navigate the calm belt.The Grand Line acts as this great divide which isolates its worlds citizens in six easy to categorizemonitor locations especially with its magnetic interference. North South East and West blues along with Paradise and the New World  we know the East Blue is considered the weakest of the seas while the New World is considered the strongest.With the OP world set up the way it is its almost like a conveyor belt of increasing strength the closer you get to the Grand Line and the further you go down it the more Marine security the WG will need to appoint. Its very easy for the WG to predict movements of uprising with their current power structure I believe this is why weve heard so little about the Revo Army they are careful with their progress.If this conveyor belt system of navigation were to collapse pirates would literally be able to sail anywhere. What stops the East blue from being considered the strongest ocean then? It would be so difficult to monitor the world from there. Their ultimate control would be figuratively stripped from them. Pirates would be able to go anywhere common citizens would be able to sail the world and learn for themselves. Ignorant citizens are easy to control so mind expanding travel for the common people is a pretty scary thing as well.TLDR The current power structure of the WG has many reasons to keep their oceans separate with a one way travel through it. It keeps their citizens isolated and ignorant think of how mysterious devil fruits were to people in the East Blue it makes each area of ocean easy to monitor and categorize and with their resources seastone boats it makes them the top dogs of the ocean.,OnePiece,cnc79e3,7,t5_2rfz5

2804034,0,t1_cnmrw74,gtBeating  fodder marines counts no more than beating  million.That example was purely to illustrate the enormous gaps in power between some characters and other characters.gtI dont see any point in fan power leveling and ranking as any argument can be made then rendered moot three chapters later when Oda decides that Zoro slips on a banana peel during the fight. Sure you can say one character is likely stronger than another but it has no bearing on what might actually happen in the story in a fight.And how often do people lose due to slipping on banana peels? Zoro and Luffy effortlessly stomped Mr  and Ms Valentine because theyre simply much stronger. They were mostly just trying to focus on each other. This is because their levels of strength are so drastically different that Luffy and Zoro werent even concerned about them. And thats all Im saying. Power levels are a thing in One Piece whether people like it or not.gtThus I say doesnt mean much of anything sure Luffy has a higher power level than fodder marines or old EB villains but so what. Thats an obvious no duh kind of sitatuion. You dont need CoO too see people are that unevenly matched. In the scenarios where using CoO to judge power levels is going to have any relevance its going to be a too close to call fight of wills anyways. So power levels mean boo. Thats not what Im saying. Im just arguing against the notion that power levels arent a thing in One Piece. Because they are. Some people are just way stronger than others and it isnt all just a game of rock paper scissors. Im not saying Luffy and Doflamingo are gonna look at each other and instantly know who is going to win.,OnePiece,cnmt4ue,3,t5_2rfz5

Just standing liquid water up to a certain depth source is SBS       gtD Odacchi! Heres a question for you! Crocodile cant fight water because hes sand right? Then how does he bathe?! Does he at all?! Thats filthy!! Do you bathe Odacchi? by Crocodiles MothergtO First of all lets discuss the problem of Devil Fruit users bathing themselves. People who have eaten a Devil Fruit are hated by the sea and cannot swim. The sea here can refer to anything from rivers pools and baths to any kind of standing water. On a worldwide level they are all the sea. When these people enter the water not only can they not use their powers they have trouble moving their bodies at all. They might be able to struggle a bit but it wouldnt do much good. Thats if their entire bodies are submerged in the sea. With less than half the body or just the limbs it gets easier. Also rain and dripping water have no effect at all. Therefore hip baths or showers are the most common choice. Now in Crocodiles case water is the weakness of his very powers so his abilities are robbed even in the shower. But its not like there are enemies around when you take a shower so Id bet he would take them even with his powers being blocked. Dont you think? And to answer your final question about myself bathing. As it happens I do bathe. Twice! In a year!    Emphasis mine. Its a bit of an assumption to say that other forms of water dont negate DF powers but I think a reasonable one. Ice isnt The Sea.,OnePiece,cnoyovt,4,t5_2rfz5

It might make her a little overpowered though. Planting arms on someone at a distance is one thing but sensing them and doing it when you cant see them or they are moving at super speed and giving those arms CoA so they can whoop of DF users....it really follows the trend of Robin having an incredible power that is nerfed by necessity.I get the feeling she is going to give Kyros a sexy leg or maybe more than one.

When the object is born it can be assigned a purpose to which it craves to complete. It also has the hidden ability to create a new person from someones corpse restoring them to life and healing them but slightly changing their body in some way such as the woman on her crew with  eyes. The downside of this is that she cannot decide how the new person will be or act so she cannot impart loyalty.

2977414,0,t3_2u7f7c,Ill give this a try. cough coughI grew up all over the north and south blue. My father and I traveled around as traveling merchants because when my mother died we needed to go somewhere new. When I turned  I saw a strange fruit in a window and decided to eat it. Little did I know it was a devil fruit and it belonged to a horrid pirate named Shanky Boots. Anyhow I got the metal metal fruit allowing me to turn into any metal and control metal in a  foot radius of me. I went back home later that night seeing my father getting murdered by Shanky Boots because he thought he stole it. When I say this I became uncontrollably mad and slaughtered time and his men with my new power. My father was on the ground bleeding and he too me he loved me and he died soon after. After that happened I became the captain of the Metal Pirates. I recruited a couple of my street friends Shell and Hustle. Hustle was our cook and is extremely good at any game. hint the name hustler. Shell was our navigator who was naturally good at observational haki. We got to the grand line with  of us on my crew. I only recruit orphans to join my crew because I want to give them a new life. My crew and I got bounties very quickly by defeating all the pirate crews we came acrossnot killing. The Jolly Rodger would look like two bones crossing with a metal skull with wide open mouth. Although my goal was to travel the world I also gained a new goal which was to find the One Piece. I dont care for it but thats what my crew wants so I will try to find it. During my journeys my crew becomes friends with some big shots like the straw hat crew and met many once famous pirates like the Reyliegh.

Hes immune to lightning because hes made out of rubber and seems to be semiresistant to sharb objects can still get impaled. He stretches a certain part of the body to attack also making use of the suction created from the rapid movement of the respective body part.    He is also able to increase his blood flow to enter a powered up state think BankaiSuperSayanKyuubi Chakra mode know as Gear Second with increased speed resulting in more damage dealt because of the rubber mechanic. He also has another form where he grows a body part abnormally big trading speed for sheer size but hes left defenseless in a kid state for a couple of minutes afterwards.    He can also use three types of Haki which are similar to auras I guess. One allows him to sense enemy movement Observation Haki akin to the Byakugan from Maruto another one makes weaker willed foes faint Conquerors Haki and the third one allows him to massively harden certain body parts he hasnt mastered fullbody Armament Haki yet for increased damage and allowing him to hit foes which are made out of different substances based on what Devil Fruit they ate Devil Fruits are what gives people powers in One Piece.    Last but not least his most recent  finisher move is the GomuGomu No Red Hawk where he uses Armament Haki on his arm while in Gear Second and throws the punch so fast that it catches fire in midair. you could also search for GomuGomu No Jet Pistol GomuGomu No Jet Gatling,OnePiece,co7zxag,2,t5_2rfz5

But Oda decided to have Enel made of electricity not move at the speed of light so Ill give you the speed advantage.But in all other things in our world Not the One Piece world the electricity logia fruit is equal or better than the sparkle fruit.,OnePiece,co8wqwq,2,t5_2rfz5

Youre on point here. The anime has been roughly  chapter behind the manga since about episode  so they dont have a lot of room to work with. Its either  chapter per episode or youll have to deal with fillers midarc which the animation company does not want to do and I hope they never do. nothing more annoying than filler arcs in the middle of an arc.As for the manga having breaks theyre breaks cancellations occur very rarely. the last one was when he ended up in a hospital for a few days its pretty much like everyone else said its for health reasons. That and hes also probably resigned to the fact that this story will take the better part of his life to tell whether he does it every week or takes a week off every month.

You dont have to stand on the Island and wait for people to come and try and take it.

3176768,0,t3_2winff,Id mention that the series is actually pretty well written. It has a complicated lore and world building kinda similar to lord of the ringsstar wars a great adventure atmosphere Pokemon games Legend of Zelda ATLA and although it has a more cartoonish aesthetic at first a majority of the fanbase is adults. Because of this its fun to have theories and talk about the series.The manga in particular has no useless arcs and they usually end up more important a couple hundred chapters down the line especially with all that foreshadowing. Example Aces tattoo Jinbeii being mentioned during Arlong Park A building from Nolands story reappears in Laws flashback Introduction of Haki during Skypeia and Sabaody mantra amp arrowsThere is a lot of character development For example Usopp learning humility and realizing his own self worth vs. old Usopp wanting all the attention Luffys views on life postMarineford. PreTimeskip Alabastas people die vs. PostTimeskip Dressrosas I wont let anything happen to the country! Robins subtle changes in personality postWater Also being long isnt a bad thing if the series has the quality to back it up. Despite delving into more seriousmature topics later on the series still stays true to its silly roots a unique blend and balance most works cant pull off and execute.Series is good fun all around and its a great time. Show clips of Luffy pushing the Zombie into the ground Luffys Baka Song Zoro Lost and throw in some seriousmemorable nonspoiling moments. Show clips of the funimation dub to show that its a good option as well if theyre not into subtitles. Manga is also one of the top series on MAL myanimelist something exceptional especially when compared to other top manga and other shonen manga of its kind. Just look at the other Big Twos ratings Bleach and Naruto. The scores are also from thousands of users so its not just me saying this.Edit Cons of the series   Animes pacing Animes animation Animes sloppy incanon filler TLDR Anime Its not all bad and it still has its great points but the animes handling of source material has been sort of meh since the end of Sabaody. The animes length is also another thing.Check out DigibroDigibro after darks video analysis vids and Demo Ds should you watch. Theyre good examples of recommendations.

Ive always loved analyzing One Piece because for a lighthearted manga it has a serious undertone that you have to sometimes look past the jokes and goofiness to see and be amazed with.

Like for example showing a shot of running feet of a group of people stomping and kicking up little puffs of dirt. Focusing on those smaller details in succession can eat up some of the time they need to and can keep the scene moving without focusing on large groups of enemies poping out every frame. If they keep the frames moving in those low importance areas they can actually make them just a little bit better and dont have to commit much more resources.,OnePiece,cp0juks,4,t5_2rfz5

And werent they on their way to Sugar and Trebol prior to Frankys joining of the Tontatta army?And as for Gaimon Luffys made of rubber. There was no harm or foul. Had it been Nami or Zoro do you really think they would have been so forgiving? Nami acknowledged that Hatchan wasnt as bad as the rest and forgave him while Luffy and co. were nowhere near ready to do so. Barring wonderful Takoyaki of course. Boa and her sisters tried to kill him yes. But at the same time he stopped an event from happening that would have impeded on their fight and in return Hancock corrected the wrongs she committed and righted them. Then there was the whole love sickness bit which was influenced by Luffys previous decisions but was truly cemented the minute she found out he punched a Tenryuubito through the wall.And as for FI. The only reason he helped out was for his friends and crews safety. Not for Fishman Island or its people specifically. Its why they tried to book it right out of there after they were done Well. That and they didnt want to be acknowledged as Heroes. And personally its not that I dont like that Robin bonded with them.

3382570,0,t1_cpdsrs4,Being useful to a pirate crew isnt always about being the strongest but having a specific skill.  Rebecca not only has CoO but has somewhat developed her fighting style to be a protective kind more about containing a situation than causing physical harm.  Obviously this style is not the best choice in all cases as highlighted in this arc but various situations can arise in the greater context of the New World where a different fighting style may be necessary.  Rebeccas dream if anything would be to expand that fighting style further and pass it on to others.  In terms of the arc though shes obviously attached to her father but much less so to her country as most of her life and especially before Doffy she lived in isolation in the Flower Field.  Her father clearly wants her to be protected but this arc has proven that his strength has limits against the usual players in the New World.  If Kyros really wants her to be safe after some reflection he will either tell her to learn more from Luffy about being stronger or he will ask Luffy to help him protect her.

Luffys crew obey his orders look up to him as a leader and would likely each throw away their life solely for the sake of Luffy. Theyll follow him to the end of the world and then again. Being crew isnt about who gets to fight the most. People have the tendency to fall into the mistaken belief that combat ability and being strong is all that  matters in the crew. But the crew is founded on relationships a hierarchy and unquestionable faith in the captain.As strong as Law is and as close as hes become with Luffy in the past arc there are more important things and people in Laws life objectives nakamathan Luffy. Also Law wants to find One Piece. As for Hancock same thingshe may be blindly in love with Luffy but her dream her goalstheyre not compatible. Shes not his crew shes an ally with similar goals and operates outside the boundary of the crew.I get that people like Law. And Hancock. And X Y Z Characters but popularity fighting ability strength those arent qualities that make someone part of the Straw Hats.

Get to the moon destroy everything. No substance. Hody Jones? Blind rage destroy everything and everyone. Buggy? Get rich. Akainu. Absolute justice. And no these are not oversimplifications.Too many major villains have been one dimensional.From a literary standpoint the fact is that their isnt much substance to the villains.I encourage you guys to really think about this.

That would involve a fleshing out of his past and Luffy alleviating some past trauma like he did with Chopper Nami Robin and currently is with Law.  Otherwise I see at least two major camps of Supernova with Luffy and Kidd being the heads.  Its highly unlikely if possible that Kidd would subjugate himself to Blackbeard so he will be a big force for a long time unless he is killed off.  ,OnePiece,cq4c7th,11,t5_2rfz5

Luffy could change his elastic characteristic to not only absorb attacks but cause them to immediately react back. Similar to how he bounces bullets back but imagine if even punches kicks and if hes dense enough sharp objects immediately react back hurting the attacker instead. The weakness because there has to be a weakness may be that he can do little else in that state. In the case with Doffy it could make him more resilient to Doffys strings and allows Luffy to turn Doffys physical attacks if not imbued by haki against him.,OnePiece,cq6w6od,1,t5_2rfz5

3690944,0,t1_cqcv5d0,Youre almost entirely right. There are a couple of arcs that break the trend especially in the anime. I am not even going to mention animation quality in that regard!Im not going to entirely spoiler my thoughts on certain arcs but only the parts that someone unfamiliar with the series could find as a spoiler or reference point if they catch up. As such I think the below paragraphs should be readable by someone who hasnt read the series  arcs in question without being spoiled on the subject.The arc with the Spoiler Shields Noro Noro Beam is very subject to taste for example. Some people think it is awesome others think it shouldnt exist. The anime only butchered it further.The one with the Spoiler Shields Belfry is a pretty typical One Piece story but often people complain it is too long  slow and that they couldnt keep their attention on it. Its relatively solitary nature compared to the rest of the story doesnt help in that regard.The one with the Spoiler Shields Tamatebako on the other hand tries to be a parody. Arguably it does a pretty good job and I think that when people reread it it is actually a pretty decent arc. On a weekly basis though the individual events felt rather forced. The villains reasoning can be thought of as a copout or as a case of Odas genius and I have only come to see it as the latter when I reread the arc at a later date. But this arc always suffers because of what it has to be and certain events simply drag on for too long. The anime butchered this arc in ways that I cannot explain without spoiling something but for a first time viewer without comparison material it is apparently still a quite decent watch.There are a few more smaller arcs that are not literally a part of the everincreasing curve of awesome but as they are primarily meant as the glue between the bigger parts of the story I do not feel they ought to be discussed as such. They are decent arcs and if they were anything more it would do an injustice to the actual highlights of the story.And to those reading this thinking man One Piece must suck! I will remind you that these are only a couple or arc. Theres easily double probably even triple that  Im too lazy to count!  which do in fact adhere to the rule of EverIncreasingAwesome. Likewise I remind you that even the bad arcs get a lot of love from the fans and that it becomes easy to hate on a sturdy Toyota or even a Mercedes when everything else is Ferraris Jaguars and Porsches. ,OnePiece,cqczpkk,1,t5_2rfz5

Coby will become and admrial but not until after the current marines are taken down at the series end. Coby cannot become an Admrial before series end it would make too little sense. Coby started FAR weaker than Luffy it theres no way even with the most intense Garp training for him to have enough of a power boost to equal Luffy story wise that would mean that Coby has naturally more talent and appituide than any of the MT which would then make them lose what makes them seem special as protaginists. ,OnePiece,cqg9qf5,1,t5_2rfz5

But with Toei doing the animation the complete thing is basically being screwed over more and more.

3957315,0,t1_cr18yf0,gt  rumble balls interfered with the devil fruit wavelengths or somethingif thats true then i could definitley see awakening as a mental state. in reference to doffy with his abilities being strings one could imagine him pondering the existence and the aspects of the universe in terms of strings ala string theory where everything is string. thus allowing him to turn everything into string. in terms of luffys growth in power aside from his physiological strength it was always been in the way he thinks of rubbergomu. in normal fighting he uses rubber in the most basic way bouncy resilient momentus swinging it around and smacking things hard with it. gear second was heated and vented rubber almost liquid. gear third has to do with rubber being inflated and its transfer of power while inflated. and now gear fouth a basicly galvanized hard rubber that includes elements of gear nd and rd with his new haki powers and perhaps with that a concept of vulcanization. imo if luffy does awaken the most logical would be to realize that real rubber grows from trees and maybe he could actually produce rubber like a rubber logia and use gun based moves where he actually shoots balls of galvanized rubber at people AWAKENED PISTOL BOOOOOOOOOM and all that type of attacks. but who knows oda just blew my mind in the last  chapters so hard. ,OnePiece,cr7d8qh,1,t5_2rfz5

3967636,0,t3_35u7ot,I believe you are most likely correct.  Ive always considered the line about it not snowing when Ace was around to be foreshadowing for the rain that fell the at the moment Crocodile was defeated.  Crocodile claimed that sand was the power of dryness so I believe he was most likely keeping his surroundings dry to help incite the civil war.   This would mean Crocodile is awakened and being that he is the person that explains awakened zoans that seems kind of likely.So at the very least the concept of Logias affecting their environment with their element was definitely established back then.  Whether or not he planned for this to be awakening and it being something that can apply to fruits other than logias is hard to say but I dont think its that unlikely.   I would be surprised if he didnt have the general concept of what DFs are planned from the start and this relates to that.  ,OnePiece,cr8jlwa,1,t5_2rfz5

4057599,0,t1_crirj8m,The case with Sabo could be nothing more than igniting fire on both ends not awakening. As weve seen before with the mera mera no mi there doesnt need to be direct contact for ignition. It seems there was a misinterpretation in what I said...I pointed out Whitebeard being able to use his powers through his body alone because the fruit was digested by him not his bisento. Yet Whitebeard was able to channel the gura gura no mi ability through and to his bisento thus WB is an awakened Devil Fruit user Kinda expected from a Yonko. Now carry this logic over to Fujitora who has been speculated to not be the DF eater but rather his sword. I believe that he is the Devil fruit user and utilizes his gravity powers along awakening mastery directly to his shikomizue. Blackbeard was not shown distributing gura gura no milike abilities through any inanimate object yet WB has with his bisento. Im sure if BB did try to make some conduit for the gura gura no mis abilities at Marineford that object would been destroyed. Why? because that is an awakening skill and Blackbeard was not a master of the DF at that moment.gt Law enel and pica do so as wellDo you mind expanding on this?,OnePiece,crisop4,1,t5_2rfz5

Hell Robin didnt even get a fight this arc yet Cabbage and the new don did. They had months wasted on their fights and Robin got shafted. Ten times out of ten a main character should get focus before characters were either unlikely to ever see again after this arc or who will never play more than a minor role.

I imagine his fighting style involves a lot of long distance and flying around in sand form. Not much getting hit.Luffys DF was what sealed the deal. If Luffy had discovered the water weakness but not had the Gomu Gomu Luffy still would have lost. Croc would have kept it mid to long distance and won.Luffys stretching was the clincher. Luffys fruit lets him attack from long to midrange with physical attacks something that I dont actually think we have seen other fruits do.

4131148,0,t1_crr5rf7,What you quoted is what I am going to say again. He has no other choice. Yonkou is a title that you dont necessarily decide for yourself. It isnt a given or regulated title but more of something that people recognize you as once you have both immense power and lots of alliesterritory. The empire wont shackle Luffy because he is the leader of it. He wont in anyway be forced into responsibility for it because he is Luffy. He will just call on them when he needs them and allow them to use his name. Same as Whitebeard. And yea he will have to react to people who attack his territories but does that really seem like something he would consider a burden? Regardless of if it was canon during Strong World Luffy was ready to turn around and go straight back to east blue to defend his home I dont think he would even debate the idea of defending his allies if they needed him to. Also they wont just fall apart when Luffy wants to go on adventures because the allies he has gathered this arc are first hand witnessing how reckless and childish this man can be and they are still following him. A yonkous empire is not a business with regulated rules. They are pirates plain and simple. If Luffy wants to go on an adventure I dont think his allies would try to stop him. ,OnePiece,crr6auz,1,t5_2rfz5

4143309,0,t1_crrwics,Wrong link she mentions the marines in the next page and she says that in this scenario which is also a mentality that Issho shares with Viola however do you think that Issho will quit the marines after this? no similarly it is unlikely that Viola will refuse the help of the marines after all this is over mainly because that means leaving the world government Which Dressrossa is a part of just like Alabasta and effectively becoming a pirate country this time for real and their only trade partner will become other outlaw countries a thing that will become even more difficult if we take into account that the revolutionaries will reveal to the world how Dressrosa was involved with arms trafficking to fuel wars in other countries while keeping themselves at peace even if this was all under Doflamingos rule the fact remains that the main base was on their country this effectively leaves Dressrosa with only a couple of allies Flower Country thanks to the presence of the Happo Navy  Prodence Kingdom because the king himself is there Wano Country assuming that Kinemon is influential enough Ryugu Kingdom because they too are under the flag of the Strawhats and thats it if they get lucky maybe Sabo is hit by some brilliance and shares some connections with them other than that they will have the world as their enemies and theres a difference here Dressrosa is not Ryugu Kingdom Ryugu Kingdom was never a part of the world government and from the beginning they were under the protection of pirates first by the Sun Pirates and Whitebeard then by Big Mam and now the Strawhats Fishman island didnt had any other option but to go with whoever was willing to defend them Dressrosa is a whole different story they are part of the WG and the only reason they were abandoned was because the current king just so happens to be a Shichibukai not only that but geographically Dressrosa is in the New World Ryugu Kingdoms main problem is pirates coming from Paradise adventuring into the New World and as we know the Straw Hats are quite famous with these rookies so their name is more than enough for Dressrosa thats not enough not only do they become economically isolated but military wise their only aid is the Strawhats and  other countries that arent really strong not only that but those very  countries have wars and problems of their own and had to send spies into Dressrosa in hopes to find a way out of their ailments not only that but is only in this arc that the Strawhats are starting to get something close to what could be called a pirate fleet by getting other allies who also have their own pirate crews this is a huge development but far from them to actually start claiming islands as if Luffy was a Yonko himself not only that but lets keep in mind that Dressrosa was able to maintain peace thanks to Dofflamingo not only i promise this is the last time i will say not onlybeing a Shichibukai but also being able to use the WG forces on top of puling the strings on the affairs of other countries igniting wars around them refusing the WG help is one of the worst decisions anyone could make specially for a country on the New World even more now that the Marines are moving their forces into the New World that means a better reaction time from their part if you really want adaptability to be a theme of this arc then refusing the aid of the Marines is a move in the wrong way i remind you even more to this day it is still a dream of the Royal Family of Ryugu Kingdom to one day be accepted by the rest of the world and by the WG the will of Otohime still lives on despite everything that happened.So if the things that you say happen which i guess can still happen we will have an arc that completely contradicts the previous one Viola the new Queen decides to cut ties with the WG while on the other hand Ryugu Kingdom is trying to actually get accepted by them will they be able to? well for that to happen the population has to first accept the ideals of Otohime in which not all humans are garbage and that is hard by itself because all they know is pirates and shitty nobles.If we go with a total rebellion against the WG and if we make Viola into a sensible ruler then her country has better chances of survival if she goes with the revolutionaries after all Sabo who is second in command and the brother of Luffy is on that very island. On the other hand theres Issho and CP as witnesses for her to make good relations with the Marines.Anyway she has options to allow her country to survive and be rebuild and then thrive as a ruler becoming an outlaw country under the protection of an upstart deserves a punch in the face punch that she will never get because we all love Luffy and no doubt the citizens will also love him thanks to the advertisement that King Riku has done for him but think about it do you really believe leaving the WG is the best option? of all the options he has if Oda goes that way i will be for the first time be disappointed specially because for what he is worth Luffy still has yet to defeat Doffy and thats him defending a country with him being there a country that at the moment only exist because the people keep their lives the rest was destroyed the moment they set sail to another island who will defend Dressrosa? you yourself made that question and somehow in a way that i can still not explain came to the conclusion of Rebecca joining the Strawhats and go against Kaido but if Kaido is really based on Kaidu that guy controls an empire Luffy is a newcomer to get things done he has to make pirate alliances and this is a place in the sea where people actually go after his head he is not feared here he is just another fish for people to grow after this arc his bounty will increase but that wont make his name become a big enough a symbol to keep people at bay from messing with him in the New World and if his name a lone cant do that then it can defend a country he is in the waters where people with power destroy entire islands on a whim really lets think about it the moment Dressrosa is targeted no one can defend it Dressrosa is probably one of the most vulnerable countries we have encountered with its biggest assets being that they had the Donquixote Family HQ set in their own country meaning they had a constant defense force a real defense force i dont mention a marine military base just for the sake of it the damn place needs it for survival can you think of a military body that will defend Dressrosa after Luffy leaves? the other pirates that allied themselves with Luffy have their own business and they will leave too the other countries that were there spying have their own problems that just leaves either the Revolutionaries which we dont really know how strong the can really be or the Marines even if i take into account the Tontatas they still need a main force.,OnePiece,crsjz8g,1,t5_2rfz5

Also the D. in his name could be an indicator that he stems from an important family line too though we dont know enough about that yet. Its not like there are were many other characters that could compete with Ace despite his young age. Training and experience can beat genes and talent sure. But with the same amount of effort the ones with good genes will always have the edge over the ones with bad genes. There are a lot of situational things that can change that of course. And often characters with natural talent  good genes tend to be arrogant and lazy since mostly they can get through with little effort. Thus they can be beaten by less talented people that gained their strength through hard work. The thing is shonen manga main characters usually aim for the very top. In the course of the story they have to beat all those lazy talents and all those hard workers. But also those rare ones that have BOTH really good genes AND lived through hard relentless training. Therefore in order to be able to compete they also need some kind of starting advantage like extraordinary talent from their lineage.Please note that I use talent and good genes somehow synonymous here even though they are probable not entirely the same but that would be another discussion,OnePiece,cs0pxn3,1,t5_2rfz5

If he was still the strongest he would probably still think there was a place for him. Again I dont think anyone surpassed his prime but I do think he deteriorated downwards enough so that others MIGHT be stronger that what he was at the end of his life.

4392519,0,t1_cskrbrm,Yeah i see what youre saying maybe Momo had a dream like becoming shogun of wano but that wouldnt apply to any future with the strawhats. he was also saying to one up Luffy but maybe there is some truth to it. Im really curious as to what Zhou will be like and who we will meet. If we go to Wano at any point it will probably be an arc with a big Zoro involvement. Him being a swordsman and the fact that he has that Ryuuma sword which pissed of Kinemon so probably a few people in Wano wouldnt appreciate Zoro all that much or maybe they do since he is a strong swordman. But yeah I find the possibility for a new crewmember in this arc very low but I feel like the longer we wait it would exaclt be like you said. besides the character feeling left out it is important for us the viewersreaders too since we need some time to adjust with the addition to the crew and built some rapport with us.,OnePiece,cskrtig,2,t5_2rfz5

4610522,0,t3_3e55oq,Its actually pretty simple. He is boring. And to an extent I understand. He was introduced in impel down yet he hasnt really had the chance to just settle down. In impel down he was used basically to get luffy to marineford. He barely talked and only told luffy to stop fighting blackbeard as marineford was more important. He talked to ace to explain why he was in prison as well. At marineford he just got luffy to ace and got him away from the battle. He didnt say anything and was used to keep the plot moving. Post marineford he got luffy back on his feet. And than in fishman island he was all exposition. The only time we see jinbe not either explaining what is happening or fightingrunning are  scenes he has with the strawhats. And they both come after the events of fishmen island. We really havent seen jinbe just hanging out. Its always been really serious with him. I personally find jinbe to be a great character but his lack of any real development is apparent.  People also dont want him to join because he is too powerfulhe is maybe stronger than sanji and they need a new powerhouse or too experiencedwhich is kind of a stupid reason.People want him to die for a variety of reasons.

4675305,0,t1_ctjoxxa,Oda seems to be spacing out the lineage thing the two strongest people of the old era Roger and Newgate  had a lineage and the other did not. I seriously doubt Zoro has a lineage of any kind his character is pretty much based on hard work alone. Usopp probably has a lineage his character involves a lot of luck. Nami is not based on lineage but rather study and hard work same with Chopper  a god damn deer and Franky. Robin does but it was way more relevant to her character than anyone else. Of the strong people weve encountered a lot have been without lineages such as Rob Lucci and Sabo. We can only speculate about the current marine admirals and sengoku who probably doesnt  have one because he and garp are a parallel to Roger and Whitebeard.From the noncrew supernovas the only lineage bearers we know are Law and Boney no idea what shes connected to just that she is connected to somethingInherited Will is pretty much the main theme of One Piece so of course the protagonist is going to come from a lineage but I believe that Oda has made a fair point that strong people dont only come from lineages. ,OnePiece,ctjvf1z,5,t5_2rfz5
4676392,0,t3_3ey3k0,Im thinking Aokiji already discussed things with Akainu probably almost immediately after the War of the Best. Possibly even with Sengoku Garp and Kong there. They needed a way to deal with Blackbeard pronto  so why not have the one of the marines admirals do it? With Sengokus retirement coming up it becomes an amazing excuse to stage a fight for leadership then have the loser defect from the marines and join Blackbeards crew.Naturally this creates a few issues  Aokijis leg the battle on Punk Hazard Akainus response to the Gorosei.In the case of the leg Im going to claim we havent actually seen Aokijis legs before and that it was already missing from the beginning. Either that or he really cut it off to convince Blackbeard that he has no intentions of rejoining the marines any more.We didnt actually see the battle on Punk Hazard and what makes it extra dubious is the fact that they did it there. Sure they didnt want anyone to be hurt  but that also means no one actually witnessed their fight. In fact the story Jinbei told the Strawhats during the Fishman island celebration that Akainu had mercy on his former comrade...sounded reaaaally fishy no pun intended. The ten days it took I could maybe believe but ten days is kinda exaggerating it. Youd think if they fought seriously the island wouldnt be neatly half ice and half fire. Thats the most suspicious part. Why would Punk Hazard be split down the middle instead of having splotches of ice and fire scattered everywhere? Unless what actually went down was Aokiji and Akainu standing on either side of the lake throwing lavafists and icebirds at each other...well...Finally Akainus response...its probably some acting on his part. To make this crazy theory work he has to have some reason for keeping Aokijis undercover mission a secret. Perhaps because the Gorosei would complain that losing an admiral just to keep tabs on a single pirate a Yonkou by now who theyre probably underestimating is a really stupid move even for Akainu? Anyway they must have a reason for keeping it secret from other marines and the government.Its crazy so lets see people try and debunk it!editgrammar,OnePiece,ctk0bo2,13,t5_2rfz5

4693592,0,t1_ctm5pdr,Yep and you seemed to just dismiss it. You are purposely trying to knock down shanks while ignoring blatant evidence. Until it is said otherwise Im going to take the mangas words over what you THINK happened lol. We got textual evidence that said shanks clashed with kaidou and turned him away from marineford. The fact simply is we have NO idea what went down in the meeting so saying anything like oh there was probably no fight and he talked him out of it is just as baseless and without evidence as anything else anyone would say. But Ill entertain your idea for a bit even if shanks only TALKED to kaidou and made him turn away that should be some kind of a signifier of shanks strength. Why the hell would an unstoppable beast that cannot be killed obey or follow any suggestion a weakling according to you shanks is weak or undeserving of his praise has given him . No matter what the reason why would kaidou listen to shanks instead of just outright ignore him brush him aside and continue to rampage towards marineford? The fact of the matter is there was some kind of mutual respect of strength between kaidou and shanks!

4750754,1,t1_cttcd3n,gtAkainu and aokiji basically destroyed an islandno. They changed its climate. When Enel was done there was nothing but a gaping hole left. And yes the ship helped him but even without it he could have done more damage than Akainu and Aokiji combined. This isnt a baseless assumption Enel showed that he can create two of those Raigou in a row and even one of them has more destructive power than any moves a admiral has ever shown. Also We dont know their capabilities is something you can also apply to Enel so that argument is invalid. And when did Aokiji ever freeze a island even close to Skypieas size?They didnt even mention Kizaru after the timeskip. Do you really think that would have been the case if he got some sort of powerup? And like i said having Armament Haki would mean Enel could destroy any Admiral who came at him it wouldnt give him a even playing ground it would make him superior to any of the Admirals.Youre talking about baseless assumption but youre assuming that no one one the moon can train him in that? We have literally no idea who else could be there and if Enel is still there is a mystery. Now THATS a baseless assumption.gtAgain we do not know how good enels haki isWrong. Completely wrong. We know that it at least spanned the ENTIRETY of Skypiea and that he was able to keep it up  and listen in to the commoners so they dont say any things theyre not supposed to say. If Enel was in Dressrosa he would know exactly what literally everybody in the country was doingsaying. Thats how good it is.gtThe snake sisters had observation haki and luffy still couldnt do much.What the fck are you talking about???gtAnd youre saying that enel could easily train to be stronger than kizaru but the idea of kizaru training to be stronger than enel is ridiculous?No im saying the moment Enel learns Armament Haki Kizaru would need to gain a serious powerup to stand a chance against Enel. What is Kizaru going to train his Armament Haki? Observation Haki? Physical Strength? Once Enel gets Armament Haki and he can actually hurt Kizaru with his lightning he is fcked. Kizarus attacks are fast but Enel can dematerialize and move faster. You would think the same goes for Kizaru but Enel can freaking eradicate a entire island from existence in seconds. He would have him running the whole fight.His feats are crazy. OP Observation Haki Speed comparable to Kizaru Destructive Power and being able to jumpstart his heart not that he would need to against Kizaru after learning Armament Haki...yes Enel could beat Kizaru with Armament Haki and for the last time im not making any assumptions you just need to go back and rewatch the Skypiea Arc and imagine Enel could hit Logia with his attack.gtwe know enel got taken down by luffyYeah...the only person we know of who is immune to lightning. Who could hit Enel without any Haki. So...your point? Are you saying Skypiea Luffy is stronger than Crocodile because he beat him too without even being immune to his DF Power? And why do you keep bringing up Luffy like he has anything to do in a fight between Enel and Kizaru?,OnePiece,cttdlok,0,t5_2rfz5

It would only make sense that it reference Sabo. Its quite clear Oda had him planned for a long time and not until Marineford. Also something I forgot to add is that Sabo was introduced as early as Lougetown along with Dragon.  I feel this to be more like your speculations grasping at straws due to your doubts of Odas meticulous storytelling and how he has everything planned when written. I think that Oda had a vague concept of Haki since the beginning and didnt fully visualize it until the end so I agree that Busoshoku Haki wasnt introduced until much later. As for everyone has it I think thats supposed to parallel Devil Fruits which were rare in the East Blue but almost generic in Grand Line. This is the same. Its an unknown concept in Grand Line but the main factor to have in the New World. In the same way Oda didnt introduce the concepts of Zoan  Paramecia  Logia until later on he instead scattered them in different places in the show. The Dials were at least objects unlike Mantra which was basically a synonym for Haki whether or not Rayleigh confirmed it in the Manga. Also Shanks himself said that he lost his arm for the sea monster as a bet. He would have already fought Blackbeard and dueled Mihawk back then so he couldnt have been so weak by that time to be defeated by a damned fish. ,OnePiece,ctyckvl,1,t5_2rfz5

4836199,0,t1_cu41ryh,No see I disagree with this fundamentally. No one is born evil but what is evil if not someone enacting it? The villains have their very legitimate non mustachetwirlingly evil reasons for doing what they do but at the end of the day theyre doing it. Who cares why. A villain is not a villain if they lack a good motivation theyre just a worse villain.You should be judged by your actions not your intentions or your history. So Doffy had a bad childhood. An awful childhood. A soulcrushingly horrific one. So what. That gives absolutely no one the right to kill millions of people on a whim and so he  deserves being put into the ground.If you want to talk about real villains in our actual real world theyre usually far worse. Most of the perpetrators of horror in our lives grew up in far better situations than Doflamingo and didnt have a giant unkillable pirate king looming over their heads. Yet they still oversaw campaigns of unspeakable evil over countless human lives.People like Enel Crocodile and Doflamingo exist and no amount of psychological analysis forgives them for their ways.

4899323,0,t1_cuc1pgb,Well its your roleplaying experience. So of course you can do it however way you want and i think you should do it the way you get the most enjoyment out of.But im personally not a fan of the more loosely defined and potentially OP fruits. I think the more specific and limited the fruits are the more creative you have to get with it and in turn the more fun it gets. My favourite canon One Piece fruit is still to this day the Gomu Gomu no Mi as it very specific in what it does but thanks to Luffys or Odas creativity it still manages to be a very versatile one without being too OP or out there in what it does. And i think this Hole Fruit have an equal amount of potential to it provided one does no stretch the capabilities of its hole concept too much as at that point it just gets silly good and not specific enough. Because as i said being limited forces you to get more creative.But again by all means do it the way that allows you to have the most fun. That is the point of role playing after all ,OnePiece,cuc3k1k,1,t5_2rfz5

4952833,0,t3_3iolmu,One thing Ive wondered is will we ever see the group who wiped out the Rumbar Pirates crew and cost Brook his first life? Ive thought about how Brook would react if he met them again. Hed probably be a bit fearful at their return for himself and the other Straw Hats and angry at them for taking away his beloved crew as well as the flesh and blood that Laboon recognized him by. Sure you could leave it as a group of generic pirates who arent worth a mention but it feels like an event too significant to do that. The attack was definitely intelligent.Its because the crew that slew them broke their rudder and left the ship stranded and unable to flee all used poisoned weapons and took out their medic then ransacked the ship and apparently stole most of its precious supplies and it happened in the Florian Triangle cut off from the outside world so it felt like a planned attack on them. Take them out in a way that they cant recover from and no one will bother looking for them anyone looking for their whereabouts wouldnt dare venture into the Triangle at the risk of being lost themselves. And that begs another question what kinda group is skilled enough to enter the perilous and possibly monsterinfested Triangle annihilate a whole crew and live to tell the tale themselves?Side note I know such a group would likely be quite old or deceased by now unless they werent human such as giants who can live around  years or otherwise had something to stay alive.

Many people mention the upcoming Wano arc and I agree that Zoro should be stepping it up pretty soon.

Sure he could go on adventures or whatever but the search for One Piece is literally the biggest adventure there is and thats what drives him. It challenges him to go against stronger and stronger opponents and brave the most dangerous seas and to him thats what being a pirate is all about. He even explicitly states at one point that he absolutely doesnt even want to know what One Piece is because then itd be a boring adventure  even though a dude who probably knows what it is is right there. The fact that he doesnt know what One Piece is is EXACTLY the point. I really dont understand your gripe with it. Its not an unimportant dream at all. Hes after the greatest mystery and the greatest treasure in the world just like countless other people and he wants to be the one to get there first and surpass all of them. He doesnt want to rule as a pirate king literally he wants to have the greatest most ambitious adventure there is. And thats why Luffy is so wonderful because he is a simple character. Hes not that complex really. Hes not concerned with vengeance or finding redemption for his misdeeds. People sometimes describe him as an antihero but hes really not.

Its not a question of changing something on a whim its that the people involved made the same mistake you did and the process didnt catch it because they dont really care if they make errors like that.gt  Oda oversees thingsNot really no. Oda has almost no involvement in the show.gt If he gave it a variant name its because it has a varying strength.Not just varying strength varying strength because he did something differently from his perspective. Pretty much every attack hes used multiple times has been used at varying strength he names attacks based on what he does to use them not how strong they are.gt His being stuck in the air for a moment does nothing for the strength of the attack its just a Gatling from aboveNo its not. As I recall hes used gomu gomu no storm twice. Once in the last fight against Crocodile he kicked Crocodile into the air then launched himself up at Croc and used storm from below him. The other time launching himself up with his gained momentum even being visually emphasized with a panel before hitting with storm from the front. In the latter case he only uses fists which means theres only one difference from gomu gomu no gatling gun the momentum.gt A good deal of the ones you named were specialized and made up on the spotLike circumstantially modifying his gomu gomu no elephant gun attack by launching himself up into the sky first? Kind of like circumstantially modifying gomu gomu no rifle because he had a giant ball of gold on his arm?gt  Eagle Bazooka and Leo Bazooka arent random at all when his entire arsenal now has an animal theme.Except his other gear second  haki moves are all hawk not eagle. And his other gear fourth moves dont involve leo  theres no leo pistol or leo stamp its kong gun and rhinocerous howitzer. Id say thats at least as random as adding thor to his elephant gun.gt Gear nd is very much about power as well.No its about allowing him to move faster the comparatively modest increase in power is a sideeffect. Theres a reason Doflamingo commented on how his gear second attacks lacked power but didnt stand around and take any of his gear third attacks.gt Youre basically misquoting events and trying to pass it off as something to support you but its not working.I havent misquoted anything so since it appears youre delusional Im going to stop wasting time trying to convince you of something you refuse to see.Just remember this conversation if the series ends without any followup on this or indications that Luffy can spontaneously produce electrical attacks.,OnePiece,cuzg34l,1,t5_2rfz5

Sure if you cant swim you will start sinking but from what I gather DF eaters just sink because it would be stupid if a devil fruit user loses the skill to swim when he ate a devil fruit. Its like losing the ability to drive a bike because you ate ate a piece of cake. And we have seen that fishmen who eat devil fruits have the same sinking problem. HOWEVER since devil fruit users feel weak when submerged enough it could also be like you mentioned and since they cant move they sink although I doubt it because the weakness is really inconsistent when it comes to moving. So I reckon that they just sink.,OnePiece,cv147eh,1,t5_2rfz5

5106745,0,t1_cv1a3fk,Flevance became wealthy because of its export of Amber Lead which was bought by people from all around the World. Amber Lead actually becomes poisonous when exposed to air and since everything in Flevance was exposed or made of it within a hundred years everyone on the island developed the disease and died of it. So many assume since all the residents of Flevance are dead so is the disease.However that is not entirely correct. The island still exists so technically if people are sent there again the Amber Lead disease could return. Also the royalty escaped the island before the killings but probably still suffer from the effects of Amber Lead poisoning since it does effect each generation and they did spend a majority of their life living amongst the poisonous Amber Lead. Finally though its only a small quantity compared to the entire island of Flevance goods such as paint utensils sweets weapons makeup and other high quality items were made with Amber Lead and shipped to other countries. Most of these items you live within eat off of put on your face ingest or wound people with. As a reminder amber lead becomes poisonous when it comes into contact with air. It is safe to assume many of these products that were imported and sold to other islands for a hundred years are also poisonous and can inflict consumers with Amber Lead albeit at a slower pace. The quantity is so low compared to the use on Flevance and it could take several generations more than on Flevance to cause an outbreak. We do not know if the world government revealed to the general public that the amber lead was the cause of the disease and recalled all products. We do not know if they rounded up families from all over the world who purchased said products and checked them for the disease as well. In conclusion we could very well see another outbreak of the Amber Lead disease if. People are sent to the former island of Flevance probably as prisoners. The royals who escaped the island are still alive and are infected as well. Everyone who bought the products from Flevance for  years are also infected with it but not at the same extremity since they probably still use the utensils and still live in houses made of the paint or still use the weapons etc. Also the people who ate it in the sweets and people who used it in make up are probably more heavily affected as it was worn on their person or ingested. this would result in a world wide pandemic.,OnePiece,cv1jy04,3,t5_2rfz5

5121447,1,t3_3l5huy,I think this page alone proves that Blackbeard is at least two separate entities in one body. BUT its most likely three. I say this because every Jolly Roger in the series represents the captain in someway and just look at Blackbeards Jolly Roger. It shows three skulls. This along with what Luffy and Zoro said proves that Blackbeard is three different people in one. Whether he has three heads that he is hiding whether he is a experiment devil fruit ability or he somehow possesses three souls in one body Blackbeard is  three different being in some way. I also think thats why he was going after the mera mera fruit. I think he wanted three of the most powerful fruits and the mera mera was going to be his final fruit. Only time will tell.EDIT At the war I think Blackbeard had a fruit hidden somewhere on his body and when Whitebeard died Blackbeards fruit became the quake quake fruit. Seems plausible since we found out how devil fruits respawn in Punk Hazard. Then Blackbeard went under the cloak to feed the fruit to one of his other to entities. ,OnePiece,cv3brh7,3,t5_2rfz5

5243659,0,t3_3mtj2q,I like this train of thought. There is also one thing that comes to mind when reading your bullet points. Devil fruit powers are not well understood by the vast majority of citizens in the four blues. Almost none have an ability some of them have met an ability user and a significant number doesnt even believe in devil fruits. But I am pretty sure that only the privileged and those with stupid luck like Luffy can ever obtain a devil fruit.Even some of the elite DF users in Paradise  believe in nonsense myths about devil fruits Jabura. And everyone but Blackbeard is scratching their heads over how Blackbeard got two DF abilities.If sanji came from an average household in north blue he would never gain access to a book with such vast and dangerous knowledge about specific  Devil Fruit abilities. The CD is one group in particular that can achieve a compilation of all this knowledge because they are rich enough to buy devil fuits like candy. Either for their own empowerment Doflamingo or fed to their slaves Boa sisters for entertainment and perhaps research?There are many advanced technologies in various stages in One Piece but the librarians seemed like a pretty conservative bunch. So I am unsure whether or not the  printing press exists. Then again there probably isnt a catalogue of Devil Fruit powers on millions of bookshelves since only Blackbeard an Sanji not even Nico Robin have mentioned reading one.My conclusion sanji has some ties the celestial dragons.,OnePiece,cvi1te4,2,t5_2rfz5

Sanji and Zoro fight everything. They get awesome moments everywhere. Hell they steal epic moments fro other characters Im looking at you Zoro and at least pretimeskip theyve had to do it under great duress. Your standards are set so high for a good fight that you may as well stop watching the series my friend. Your fears are deeply rooted in some elevated expectations of what is good and what is bad. What are you expecting precisely? Because in  chapters its safe to say Zoro and Sanji have done...everything.Then you got Brook who cant seem to stop oneshotting every opponent hes put up against. Theyre not even fights. You dont see Brook fans freaking out andor hyperventilating over the fact he gets effortless fights.

This saga has a lot of cute character moments like Usopp Zoro and Brook being stuck in that cage or Luffy interacting with Shirahoshi. Just funny little friendships and actions that might make you smile.Although the present story isnt that great and it does kind of drag I think Queen Otohimes story later on is very compelling and interesting.

Hell fulfill his own dream of improving humanfishman relations once he starts sailing around with the Strawhats.One of these requirements is already filled bounty. But they still need to show all those signatures from the petition and that endorsement from a celestial dragon to the World Government to set that surface island up.

Now that you admit that it would work on weak people it should in theory work on strong people too because there is no inherent natural resistance or training you can do to work with no blood in your brain.What you are talking about and I agreed with is that Oda will never show robin simply choking out an evil boss character because it is boring unflashy and would take a few panels to resolve. Not only would the evil boss character have no chance to fight back there would be no action or suspense. This is why robin will never do it in the manga not necessarily because she doesnt have the power but because it wouldnt make good shounen scenes.I argue that she does have the ability but we as readers will never see it done for reasons stated above. ,OnePiece,cwbv57h,1,t5_2rfz5

Leaving the New World thats filled with other Yonko whod love to take advantage of a Yonko disappearing. Doesnt the government notice? Back when Luffy was a kid I doubt Shanks was a Yonko at the time so its believable. Now?Presumably he didnt return during Luffys childhood otherwise that would have risked his promise with Luffy. So did he just show up years later after never seeing her during that time?I think people take their relationship way too far. I dont find it that plausible that ANYTHING happened between them let alone it still be happening still. Shanks used their town as a base. Pirates like to drink so they spent a lot of time in the bar.Cant Makino just have a loving husband who doesnt have to be a major character?

The third group is also a lot like Logia in that they can create the element or objects in abundance though their bodies are just regular bodies.Im still not sure why Blackbeard is labeled as Logia his power to generate darkness but his lack of invulnerability are more consistent with a Paramecia like Mr s wax. His absorbing materials and other peoples powers are more about the power of dark itself than anything else. The power of it alone is insufficient Whitebeards ability to break things scaled up so that he could break the world and shatter an island but that has more to do with his strength than with the fruit itself.

5992149,0,t3_3xj2qc,Brook is weak.Reality Brook hasnt been shown to do anything that would suggest hes weak in a very long time. On the contrary most of what hes done since his famous defeat has suggested the opposite. He lost against Ryuma and just like every other member of the crew couldnt put a scratch on the Pacifistas prior to the crew splitting. Every other instance of him in true combat form since the TS has only showcased how powerful his old moves and new moves have become. But he still gets so very little credit for it. So basically I get irked when I see those rank the Straw Hat strength polls and see the mass underestimation of his characters ability in a fight. Ill  accept it if Oda decides to show him getting his arse whooped by some highertier New World opponents but that hasnt happened. Brooks done nothing but actively support protect and rescue the other crew members for nearly  years of One Piece history. Hes oneshotted and outwitted everyone hes come against since the TS ended.

I do not see it become true actually but just a good one heh. Its that Straw Hat Pirates gets to understand over time how devil fruits functions and how to eat  fruits at once.Law would die against Kaido and the Ope Ope Fruit would be recreated.  Luffy who shares the will of D and follows rogers steps will have the same incureable disease.  Chopper who already has a devil fruit gets to eat Ope Ope.  The doctor who takes care of Laboom was the doctor on Rogers crew who failed to cure the incureable disease. which Roger would die to if not executed by the Marines.So basically the Ope Ope Chopper will be a doctor on a whole new level who can cure and save LuffyAs stated this is by far a long shot theory with a lot of IFSand then the other theory that I believe in and hope comes trueBig mom. as in BM. has similarities with Maijin Buu as in MB from dragon ball   BMMB,OnePiece,cylf2qr,3,t5_2rfz5

6175592,0,t3_404td6,First of all you need to format your posts a little bit. Having a huge wall of text with no paragraphs makes it very hard to read. Okay here are some thoughts from a long time One Piece fan. The first thing I noticed in your post is this gtAfter watching  episodes of the subbed anime off and on over a period of years to even get this farYou are very early on in the series and it gets objectively better. Prior to the Alabasta arc the series is really just finding its footing. What your watching is more than a decade old at this point and the series has developed a lot since then. If you are really not feeling it I would recommend skipping forward in the series. If you get hooked then you can go back and rewatch with renewed interest. Popular arcs to jump into would be Alabasta Water  and Marineford.Something to keep in mind is that unlike Bleach and some other Shonen One Piece isnt primarily a battle manga. gtbecause its supposed to be a wacky adventureAs you say One Piece is more about the adventure than the fights. If you dont enjoy the feeling of discovering a new island and new characters you probably wont like One Piece  which is fine. AlsogtThe characters just dont have an appeal which makes me care about them like previous anime and the comedy consists mainly of slapstick and people yelling at one another which to me isnt funny anymore after the first couple occurances. This is a major red flag. If you dont enjoy the comedy of One Piece you are just not going to enjoy the series. Period. One Piece never tries to get to serious and that is personally why I love it. gt Im leaving the art alone here even though I think its easily the most unappealing and untalented work of any of the mainstream mangaAnother red flag if you dont enjoy the art it only gets more wacky. Your criticisms of the world not having depth or clearly established rules are pretty unfounded but to be fair you are only at the very beginning of the series... you havent even seen the One Piece world let alone how deep it is.  Id say skip ahead to Marineford the most battlemanga esque arc or water  the best arc. If you cant get into them and if you dont get at least a few laughs per episode then the series is simply not for you. ,OnePiece,cyrlngi,3,t5_2rfz5

And there is a great amount of Marines without that kind of driveBut there are top tier pirates and marines. Thats my point.I dont know what to say.In universe theres no evidence any such bounty hunters exist.Out of universe it doesnt really make sense. Were in the second half of the series and everything seems to be leading up to massive confrontations between the protagonists the Yonko and the government. Super strong bounty hunters dont seem likely to play any importance. If they dont have any role within the narrative why bother thinking they exist within the universe at all?The default position is not to believe something unless its been shown to be true a satisfactory degree. You have the burden of proof. You need to give evidence to show why you think there are super strong bounty hunters before you can explain why they dont appear in the series.And even if you did somehow give evidence that such bounty hunters do exist youre not disproving my idea.What are you even trying to do here?,OnePiece,cytxp95,1,t5_2rfz5

6232893,0,t1_cyy302p,I discovered today that according to Oda in SBS  Crocodiles bounty would be at least double what it was if his bounty wasnt frozen upon becoming a Shichibukai. So thats about  Million. Which is pretty good. And pretty in line with my previously established opinion that Crocodile was supernova level at best.And yes I can believe Enel would have a bounty of  Million. He has crazy powerful lightning powers that basically make him a god in a thunderstorm and he has destroyed an entire Island and all of its inhabitants beforeand tried to do it a second time. I still think a strong Haki user would make him look foolish because of his low physical strength and Haki proficiency but hes certainly a dangerous man if you arent made of rubber.,OnePiece,cyy41o6,1,t5_2rfz5

6234273,0,t1_cyxr65k,Alright Im just going to state my opinion as clearly and simply as possible and if you still dont see it my way then well just have to agree to disagree. It may get long but Id really appreciate it if you took the time to read it anyway as it will be my final attempt to persuade you.First of all I dont think Crocodile is weak. But I also dont think hes terribly strong in the grand scheme of things. Ive stated before that I think he is at best on the level of the Sabaody supernovaspretimeskip and I stand by that claim. And I believe the evidence supports my evaluation.The first and most important reason why I believe this is what Ive already said. Luffy was able to best him physically before he learned Soru or develped his gears. There is a colossal difference in strength between Luffy when he fought Crocodile and Luffys current strength. And yet Luffy is still struggling with the big names of the New World.My second bit of evidence is this. Oda stated in his SBS that if Crocodile hadnt had his bounty frozen his bounty would be at least twice what it was. Which puts him at about  million. Which would be totally in line with my previously established opinion that hes around supernova level.And third it just makes sense given his backstory and character profile. I often see people claim that hes a world class pirate and just seems weak because he was introduced too early and that he just looks weak due to power creep. But you can only really see it that way if you ignore his entire backstory. What do we know about Crocodile? Well we know that at one point Crocodile was a rising star and making a name for himself in the pirate world much like Luffy did in his run through paradise. And that fairly early on Crocodile went to the New World and challenged Whitebeard. Whitebeard utterly crushed him and after that Crocodile retreated to paradise and began searching for the ancient weapon pluton.So I think its pretty clear that Oda intended to portray Crocodile as a fallen star. He had made waves early onperhaps a super rookie like Luffy and made a name for himself. Then he marched into the New World after a fantastic run through paradise probably thinking he was hot shit and immediately challenged the strongest pirate alive to a fight. And after a crushing defeat he retreated back to Paradise and went in search of ancient WMDsprobably because he realized the enormous difference in power between himself and the best of the New World.Imagine an alternate universe where Luffy didnt have Rayleigh and Jinbei. After being crushed by Kuma and being too weak to save his brother at Marineford he may very well have given up on his ambitions and stopped progressingwell then again Luffy is Luffy so maybe he wouldve eventually pulled himself together. Thats what Crocodile did. He lost the drive that he once had started a secret organization to do all of his dirty work for him and stopped progressing for nearly  decades.That said Crocodiles story isnt a totally negative one. Crocodiles story is also about redemption. The events on Alabasta and Marineford seem to have renewed his ambition and now he has set off into the New World again with Daz as his first mateand presumably he has gathered more crew members since then. I expect him to be much stronger when we next see him.You say that because Oda has absolute say about what happens in the story power levels can fluctuate to fit the current plot. And youre not wrong. He does have the power to do that. But overall Oda is actually one of the most consistent and methodical writers in the entire Shounen genre and it would be very unlike him to have Crocodile jump ahead that far in strength after doing nothing but sit in a jail cell for a matter of months. And while Crocodile did show guts at Marinefordas Oda was clearly setting him up for a comeback he also didnt explicitly do anything at Marineford that would suggest he had gotten considerably stronger. I dont think Doflamingo ever intended to fight himin fact he was trying to recruit him and just generally likes messing with people. And I believe Mihawk was so shocked that Crocodile of all people would help Luffy that he considered Luffy to have passed his test and moved on. I dont think he had any desire to fight Crocodile and at that point he was finished testing Luffy. Daz defending Luffy doesnt have the same significance so he just cut him down and continued after his target. In the case of Whitebeard he was never able to challenge him because Luffy and the Whitebeard pirates were in his way. And with Akainu he basically just got in one good sneak attackwhich did no damage and was purely to buy time.So in conclusion... Crocodile has guts and a renewed determination. And I believe he will be much stronger when we next see him. But at no point before the timeskip do I believe he was any stronger than Supernova level. Because that is the level he was on when he was crushed by Whitebeard and quit progressing. I dont think there is any strong reason to believe otherwise. If you still think Im wrong then well just have to agree to disagree and move on.,OnePiece,cyy9oze,1,t5_2rfz5

Spoilers for those not caught up to the anime. Although it isnt canon Koumei used Haki to change his fan into the form of the sword and even changed the swords shape and length on the fly. Much like Boundman the Haki isnt just coating a singular thing like a fist or sword. It is in a deliberate shape such as the patterns on his chest or when it moves to counter Doflos Athletes foot attack. We still have yet to see the repelling Haki that the Boa sisters Sentomaru and Raylieh demonstrated in the post time skip battles or combined Haki like the Admirals used to deflect that attack during Marine Ford.

6666365,0,t3_46x1m0,Posted a similar theory a while back Ill post it below. I think it is pretty simple and theorists overthink it.Before dismissing this understand that this theory is simple and not some crock Cerberus Theory. Blackbeards power can pull in and hold on to mass with his Yami Yami no mi. He can also release what he takes in. He can draw in a Devil Fruit users body and he can also suck in the devils power My theory is pretty simple and works using the principles shown aboveBlackbeard can have multiple devil fruits and is hunting down the fruitsusers to gain their abilities because he can have many at one time. He sucks in a DFs body and holds it in his darkness along with the fruit goes its power and he just releases the devil fruit ability out of his Yami Yami no mi like he releases the whole town during his Liberation attack. He only releases the DF power but holds onto the body. As for how many he can have it may be infinite or he might have a hard cap on fruits he can hold. If the latter is the case he could simply release a DFs body and replace it with another. He could also keep those fruits on his ship possibly. Think of it like a Pokemon party. He is only allowed  powers but can swap out any as he pleases besides the Yami Yami no mi. Essentially he only has one ability but his darkness can hold many and utilize the powers. ,OnePiece,d08uyx6,5,t5_2rfz5

6789438,0,t3_48p0db,i think no offense in some of these youre mistaking powerful paramecia type devil fruit with powerful paramecia type devil fruit user. for instance luffy is incredibly strong no doubt about it but i dont think the gomu gomu no mi is actually strong at all. all it does is turn him into rubber. secondly i dont see how shikis power could be more powerful than isshos. to me the fuwa fuwa no mi just seems like a more limited version of isshos which controls gravity one of the fundamental forces of the universe. and personally i wouldnt have the hana hana no mi as just an honorable mention i think youre really underselling it like that. i mean robin a for the most part physically unimpressive character can single handedly defeat an entire platoon of marines with it and since there doesnt seem to be a limit to the amount of limbs she could create there is technically no character that isnt impossible to grab im including magellan and sugar in this list by the way without haki that she theoretically restrain and aside from maybe luffy can luffys bones break? snap their neck.,OnePiece,d0lvd6x,1,t5_2rfz5

Dont get me wrong Luffy still has much to learn look at him he keeps pestering momo. Will he get stronger before fighting kaidou? Almost assuredly. What Luffy needs now is more experience and a better understanding of whats really going on in his universe. Doff wouldnt really stand a chance against luffy as he is now if Luffy better understood awoken devil fruits. Ill give you though Doffy was severely crippled by Traw guy.

6975130,0,t1_d16rnne,gtJust because you can write coherently in your native language doesnt give you the right to be condescending toward other peoples English ability.Youre right it was rude so I apologize for that. In fact your English is so good that I didnt even consider that it wasnt your native language. gtIf youd like to offer your opinion argue the idea being presented. Not the ability of the person presenting it.The problem is I dont even know what your argument is. You seem to oscillate between three different ones Possible argument  The perceived drop in the quality of the anime vs the manga is not due to the animation studio but the viewers who have only recently been reading the manga and not just watching the anime.Lets test your argument a little bit. a If the quality of the anime hasnt changed the viewers have then the one piece anime since water  has remained at the same level of quality. If the anime is generally considered bad right now then in actuality it was always bad or at lease since water  and people have only just begun to realize it because they read the manga. If thats your opinion you have your right to it but it certainly isnt the conventional one as Enies Lobby Sabaody and Marineford are almost universally considered the best arcs of the One Piece anime all post going  chapter per episode. b If the conversion of the manga to the anime has remained constant as predicated by your argument the reason that the anime is considered bad right now is because the quality of the manga has taken a downturn not the actual translation of it to the anime and thus proportionately affected the anime. However this makes no sense in the context of your argument as it was totally predicated on people recently negatively comparing the anime to the manga. If the manga was also worse then the people would be saying One Piece is shit rather than the One Piece anime is shit. c That the anime has done a worse job of interpreting the manga and that has resulted in a loss of quality. This makes no sense in the context of your argument as it is the very thing that you are seemingly arguing against  that the loss in quality over the course of One Piece anime is effected by the viewer NOT the makers of the anime. d Furthermore you later stategtI myself do hope postDressrosa we get some  months fillers so that the pacing doesnt go . ch. per episode like we sometime get now.So you admit that the pace of translation has gone from  chapter per episode to . chapters per episode. This means that the entire basis of your argument that it is the viewer being exposed to the manga rather than the actual translation of the manga that is the thing that has changed is factually incorrect and you know it is. Furthermore because the manner in which the manga is being translated into the anime has changed you cannot by the logic of your argument that it hasnt use it to prove a point about the historical shift in consumers fans us of the One Piece anime. So no matter how I interpret this argument I cant see how it could be correct or even obey its own logic. Possible argument  People should buy the official One Piece manga releases because they have better quality translations. I dont know who you are arguing against or why you are even making this point? I fail to see how it is relevant to the rest of your post and just seems like a random rant in the middle. Possible argument  The quality of the One Piece anime is a direct result of external forces outside Toeis control and therefore they bare no responsibility for the product they sell and thus fans have no right to complain. Alright lets test this argument a little. a It is an almost universal expectation in the modern world that companies will be held responsible for what they produce. It should be a given. bLets pretend it isnt a given though for the sake of argument. Lets look at some reasons why the anime isnt up to par and see if its true that we cant hold Toei responsible. Contracts You say that they shouldnt be held accountable because they probably have contracts and agreements which demand they produce a certain number of episodes ect. Therefore they cannot go on break or add filler or whatever.Assuming this is true then Toei is still at fault for entering into long term contracts and giving guarantees of certain numbers of episodes when their entire business is reliant on ONE guy who gets  hours sleep a night and has been working flat out for fifteen years. If they literally built in no strategic planning and flexibility into their contracts and just expected Oda could work flat out for the next decade then that is a whole other brand of incompetence which they can rightly be held accountable for. Filler We know Toei is not contractually obligated not to add filler because they already do. However the filler they add in is generally of externally poor quality such as prolonging clashes in fights and lingering on shots for way to long having characters running for ever. So yes they can add filler because they already do its just really really bad filler. Filler does not need to actually be traditional filler arcs. Instead they could be creating more character interaction more scenes more jokes more fights or just adding anything that would actually raise the quality from the manga and contribute something to One Piece. They produce the worst possible kind of filler either because they are either incompetent untalented or..... next point  Money If they dont have enough money to properly produce their product then in this case due to One Pieces enormous popularity we can only assume that they are either being cheap saving their budget for cash cow one piece movies and specials or have been financially irresponsible. The fact that far less popular anime can have better budgets implies that yes we can blame Toei for failing to properly manage their finances the same way we can blame them for shitting pacing and animation. c Beyond all that even if we go along with your argument and absolve Toei of all responsibility for their product then that still doesnt mean that people cant complain about it because all the consumer really cares about is the quality of the product they are given. So once again I dont understand the point of this argument nor do I agree with its conclusions. ,OnePiece,d16yvps,0,t5_2rfz5

Luffy applies force into his attack whilst Kaidos fall is just gravity pulling him down. So because Kaido says his head hurts King Kong Gun should be able to due a decent amount of damage. Why? Zoro Luffy WB Garp etc have shown pain from something something seemingly minimal such as slashes or explosives even though they can handle more damage. All it shows is they can still feel pain. I suppose its similar to when you cut yourself you show pain but sometimes when youre not paying attention to it or are in a rushadrenaline you dont even notice it until much later.

7012675,0,t1_d1b2yim,The tricks they used for LOTR were relatively simple but very effective because of how they used them and varied their approach.  Tricks like body doubles and forced perspective can be done with minimal to no CGI.  TK however was talking about translating cartoon proportions to real life proportions.  LOTR doesnt have this problem since its characters didnt originally have boobs as large as a characters head or eyes larger than a fist.

Garp is also planned based on pilot chapter but as a pirate. In the interview he said he got general idea how One Piece going to end. Nami is definitely planned if we look at pilot chapters Silk and Anne as Nami. Oda wanted to keep Shanks as surprise due to his importance to Luffy backstory thus he only appeared in the final pilot chapter. Fishmen are supposed to make appearance in the first volume. Luffy is supposed to either have fire DF or rubber DF Luffy settled with rubber for potential comedic purposes.

7163433,0,t1_d1sbpu1,I would love to nestle in Nami. That goes without saying. And we didnt know he was the son of a feudal lord or why hes being hunted by Kaido until Zou which is why I said up until Zou he just seemed like he became comedic fodder after joining up with them after Punk Hazard which I found annoying. If it wasnt for Dressrosas length specifically taking two and a half years to end I probably wouldnt have felt the way I did about him if his character was developed sooner instead it just had time to fester and began to forget what his purpose even was aside from being Kinemons son. And yeah his role models were the coward trio so thats true. Im just saying Luffys constant treatment and refusal to acknowledge his noble status as well as refusing to help when asked by the Kouzukis by saying Youre the leader of all these brave strong warriors who are ready to fight to the death and yet you the leader and most important one are the only one who hasnt asked for my help? inspired Momo to grow as a person as well as a character from being the useless immature child weve seen since Punk Hazard to a more mature child whose finally starting to act like the leader he was raised to become. The development his character received in Zou was much needed in order to give more weight to the character instead of just being your typical bratty pervy kid.,OnePiece,d1sewia,1,t5_2rfz5

So theres the Parisian Carrot which is apparently a popular French variety as the name suggests. Id argue that theyre not popular worldwide at least compared to classic carrots but thats another matterConsidering Big Moms French theme I guess you could say Oda might have drawn the Parisian Carrots to reinforce an hypothetical Whole Cake Island Team foreshadowing but  call me nitpicky  the difference between the leaves throws me off especially if I think of tangerines.So heres a crack theory those mysterious things on Carrots clothes are neither Parisian Carrots nor tangerines but their fusion for a double foreshadowing.,OnePiece,d1sqswe,1,t5_2rfz5

So judging by the fact that Kizaru was completely unharmed and unfazed Im going to say that he reacted to that attack by making himself intangible not that the damage was insufficient. Either that or his fruit mastery is so good that he can unconsciously make himself intangible like Crocodile to a point where you require haki to hurt him. Since the likelyhood of someone on Sabody using haki is so small he didnt bother worrying about that bullet or Apoos attack.Either way as you can see with the link I posted surprising a logia isnt too crazy even if hes an admiral.,OnePiece,d1v05bv,1,t5_2rfz5

Theres no reason to think that observation haki wouldnt be helpful against something like Pikas rubble falling on you. Ill even give you a good example of what could be it Fujitora knew where every single piece of rubble in Dressrosa was while blind. If he didnt use observation to figure that out I dont know what it couldve possibly been because the one and only person whos ever said or done anything about the Breath of an object was Zoro and only ever in that one chapter and no other.

7382024,0,t3_4gdg66,I was having a similar discussion with my friend about this as all but one of the warlords do their job in Paradise and even Doflamingo is near the start of the New world. Their role must be to eliminate as many rookies as possible to make sure as few as possible reach the new world.Its the reason why there were  supernova in Luffys generation as opposed to the smaller numbers usually seen its because Crocodile Moriah and Jimbie were all unable to fight them off thats ths of the Warlords out of commission. But back to Crocodile I would say he fulfils a very specific part of the Warlords. His logia defence is enough to take out most rookies and I would reckon quite a few new world pirates as well. His attacks do not have scale and power that many of the other Warlords possess however they are far more deadly if you are hit with his attack you are either dead or losing a limb thanks to his drying ability. His attacks are also extremely fast as he was able to attack the platform in Marineford without anyone being able to react and was able to surprise Akuinu and bisect him.Crocodiles attack do not have scale but they have speed and they have lethality.Again all of the Warlords fulfil a specific purpose take Jimbie for example on a pure power basis he is much weaker than his fellow Warlords however he has an ability which at the time countered two other Warlords Crocodile Logia defence and Moriahs zombies. Plus he represented the world government trying to forge ties with the Fishmen trying being the key word. But he also played another role as every single pirate has to go through Fishman island having a Warlord there to fight them as they come is very important. Similarly I reckon it is one of the reasons Buggy was chosen as a Warlord he directly counters Mihawk as we saw in Marineford that Mihawk was unable to cut him.To conclude the Warlords are more of a statement politically and a way of eliminating rookies.,OnePiece,d2hab45,3,t5_2rfz5

7414054,0,t3_4guwkq,Well technicaly this was after I watched it as a kid but when I first watched it I didnt really have much to think about it. Its just a bunch of pirates fighting. What I really underestimated was the complexity of the story and also how casual everyone would use there devil fruit. I thought it be like in a video game were they dont use it unless its in battle.,OnePiece,d2kxh3h,3,t5_2rfz5
7414553,0,t3_4guwtf,Since the latest chapter didnt do much but confirm the theory of Kidds defeat and confirm the theory of Pudding being the  eyed girl then I think we should maybe talk about the Reverie and how we all think it might go. Personally Im under the impression that Vivi has some ulterior motive. I dont think shes going as a princess but instead intends to represent her country in her fathers place. If she were to do this then it could mean the grand fleet grows even bigger. Elizabello is already on very good terms with Luffy and if he and Vivi become friends they may come to an agreement this will give Alabasta a ridiculously powerful ally in the future. I think this is important because once the government finds out about Vivis relation to the straw hats there will surely be repurcussions and I dont doubt that other pirates will attack as well in an attempt to draw out Luffy. If the Marines work together with mutual enemies of the Straw Hats then Alabasta Sakura Kingdom Water  Dressrosa and Fishman island may be in trouble. I think that the reverie will bring up the topic of the Straw hats Luffys connection to Dragon and Dragons defeat. I think that when the Straw hats are brought up well see many members visibly tense up. Wapol might bad mouth him and that would spark quite the debate. Shirahoshi however is where the theory comes together. I doubt the kings and queens would talk separately. So I think Shirahoshi might act as a catalyst and accidentally defend Luffy and mention their friendship. Once this happened people who are on Luffys side may come forward and create an unspoken alliance between his personal Allies. This would be the start to Luffy gaining territory. All these islands coming to the unspoken agreement that they will ally together under Luffys flag. ,OnePiece,d2kziqz,0,t5_2rfz5

7415355,1,t3_4guzmo,I dont understand what point your trying to make  if your trying to say that luffy is stronger than doffy  then i have to disagree  although it could be interpreted both ways I personally think that if it was just a one of one fight  luffy would have lost.Yes luffy went through the whole arena before hand  but the fight with all the most powerful fighters  all the ones that got through  he wasnt even part of  Sabo replaced him at the difficult part. Plus luffy spent two years on a kill or be killed island ... He can handle a few scrubs at a tournament.Now against doffy  law had already fought with doffy on multiple occasions  draining both their stamina a little  which probably brought doff yall stamina down the same amount as the tournament did to luffy. On top of that doffy got destroyed from the inside out with laws gama knife thing  not sure if that was the name  Which means  while luffy was pounding on him in gear th  he was STILL trying to repair the damage law had done  and he was still holding back his true awakening ! When luffy ran out of gear th it was only because the people helped him escape that he managed to survive  otherwise that would have been the end of it ...

Fighting bellamy or leaving the scene would have been saying that luffy couldnt take the emotional abuse and needed to end it. he didnt need it to end. thats why he won that fight. Luffy was obviously disgusted and bothered when he realized that bellamy was really a guy with no dream or ambition. It was not a situation he wanted to run away from or escape from. He wanted to deal with it in that way.

Historically longbowmen have actually deformed their arms to the point where archaeologists can identify them from their skeletons by pulling back such immense weight repeatedly. He might be physically weaker than someone fighting upfront I dont know enough to offer conjecture but as far as the title weakest straw hat goes purely on physical strength I dont think its that easily placed on Usopp. That said Physical Strength  Combat Effectiveness as Nami and Robin show us by being likely not much stronger than the average marine in my eyes and regardless of that clearly not on the typical herculean strength of the New World but clearly being far more competent than those of comparable strength through the use of their powers. ,OnePiece,d2wvai3,2,t5_2rfz5

Whitebeard for example was going to die very soon anyway and thats when Teach would snag the TremorTremor fruits powers and claim Whitebeards land while the WB pirates just lost their captain and are weak. Everything would still fall into place.So in the same way in this point of One Piece if anything were to shock Luffy again someone close to him dies any real shocking news he would succumb to his emotions and start getting the intention to go on the offense against the ones causing it.

Luffy was oneshotted by Lucci but solod him the next day. This is One Piece the strawhats in particular progress extremely fast in terms of strength from arc to arc.

7657662,0,t3_4k3g25,After knowing that vinsmock is also a royal family but without land I get a feeling that all this marriage thing is world governments plot to assasinate big mom. I think its weird for royal family to make a relation with yonko without world government trying to interfere. Like even arabasta need to hide their involvement with strawhat or dofy that need other persona joker as identity when dealing with kaido. Probably world government is already tired with the age of pirates or trying to expand their influence to the new world that they try to assasinate one of the yonko. Probably vinsmock is chosen because theyre an infamous assasins family and theyll easily agree to do it if theyre being given some of big moms land.At first vinsmock trying to arrange a marriage between puding and one of vinsmocks son  or maybe  or . But when the whereabout of sanji is being revealed they make a change on the plan and use sanji instead. This is because strawhats is known to care very much about his nakama that hell challenge tenryubito marine hq or impel down to free their nakama. Therefore by using sanji it will lead strawhats to confront big mom and in the mids of their fight vinsmock will assasinate big mom. This way all the blame will be given to the strawhat pirates.,OnePiece,d3cmt46,4,t5_2rfz5

7682609,0,t3_4kjvnj,I dont think the hat has anything to do with the will of D or that previous owners of the hat were members of the D lineage. I think its just a regular hat which Roger just happened to  wear it and it became a symbol for greatness or something special for Roger which in turn was recognised by others around him Rayleigh who understood the meaning behind that hat and Roger passed it onto Shanks because he believed he was special not because hes a D but hes just a great person who was destined to become a great pirate. We barely know much of Shanks and i doubt Oda would make him a D as well because he is a character thats a stepping stone for Luffy and i believe Shanks has discovered what One Piece is and it could be related to Luffy through the will of D and Shanks just wants to help him reach that point. Also Pirates were a thing before Roger however it was Roger that shook the world and created the many pirates we all know of today. All because he said they can have his treasure its yours if you find it. This led to the great age of pirates as during or before Roger pirates may not have had the notorious status it has today with the many rookies that are taking over the grandline and entering the New World.,OnePiece,d3fgrxr,3,t5_2rfz5

7899279,0,t1_d43lxd6,I agree with most of your points and one thing I would like to add is that Laws power is surgery. This means that all of his operations require some kind of physical motion on his part to take effect and this physical motion often gives away what he will do. For example to cut something inside his room he still needs to make a slashing motion towards it with his sword. This gives an incredibly knowledgeable and physically superior opponent like Doflamingo the opportunity to realize what he is trying to do and dodge or stop him somehow. For example when Law tried to take Doffys heart with Mes Doffy stopped him by preemptively grabbing his hand preventing him from completing his Operation. Id bet that if Law tried to switch Doffy and Trebols bodies Doffy would realize what he was doing and use his superior speed to stop him from performing the Operation before he could complete it.,OnePiece,d43ybab,8,t5_2rfz5

How would the crew divide if Caesar really was invited?

They got used to and find the English dub voices comforting and befitting of the characters. To you the dub is not as good as the Japanese voices. To others the Japanese voices dont fit with the characters as well.I personally watch the subbed version. Thats how I started. Im alright with the dub but Im used to hearing the original voice actors. Im used to reading subtitles. I believe the original has nuances the dub does omit simply because the language barrier doesnt permit...but I dont think its so superior that Im left standing in the hall naked and baffled as to why someones opinion might differ from my own.The short answer? Some people like watching anime and listening in their own language. Its a preference. Not everyone cares about the nuances and the quirks because the dubbed version builds its own character.

8128934,0,t3_4qiwfb,Name Arjuna MikhailOccupation Martial ArtistAssassinDF HitoHito no Mi Model AkumaBackstory An orphan that grew up in a monastery on the Grand Line Arjuna was found as a baby by Monk Singh and was raised to become a monk also. As he grew up Monk Singh teaches him both yoga and Rokushiki. By age ten Arjuna is shown to be a genius at using Rokushiki able to master all six techniques with his yoga training to balance the violence of learning the Six Powers. When Arjuna and Monk Singh leave their temple for meditation deep in the mountains their temple is attacked by mountain bandits. When they return to their devastated temple and see the remains of all the acolytes and masters Monk Singh senses a deep rage hidden within Arjuna and when it finally boils over he unleashes a wave of Conquerors Haki. Using Soru and Geppou Arjuna leaves and tracks down the bandits that did this to their outpost where one lone female survivor of the temple is being tortured and is about to be cooked and eaten. Just as Arjuna is about to extract vengeance Monk Singh arrives and tells him that if he goes down this path of the demon he will no longer be a student of the temple and will be excommunicated. Using Shigan he hits a pressure point in Monk Singh to temporarily paralyze him and then proceeds to massacre the bandits. The bandit leader turns out to be a transplant from the New World and a former pirate underling who has the basic understandings of Haki and he puts up a valiant enough fight against Arjuna. The girl taken captive is used as a human shield when it seems like the bandit leader is losing. He threatens Arjuna that he will kill her if he doesnt surrender which pushes his rage to the boiling point and he one again unleashes his Conquerors Haki. Bandit leader doesnt lose consciousness but he breaks into a sweat and throws his hostage as he realizes what he is up against. She hits a tree instantly breaking her back and her cry of pain tips his rage further. Unconsciously he uses Armament Haki mixed with Shigan and Soru and rapidly punches holes into the bandit leader killing him. Monk Singh arrives to late to stop him as Arjuna gives him the killing blow. Arjuna leaves when Monk Singh tells him that he is truly a demon after what he done to the bandits and that he immediately want him off the mountain. Arjuna goes back to the temple where he steals their great treasurethe HitoHito no Mi then takes the heads of the temple apprentices to use their skulls as a prayer beads. After he eats the HitoHito no Mi from hunger he leaves the mountain and joins as an apprentice on a pirate crew and sailed with them for nine years before setting off to form his own crew under the banner of the Beast Pirates. He has fully mastered both Haki and Rokushiki while still pursuing his yoga training that he hasnt fully mastered but is close to finding balance within himself.

Anyways lets agree to disagree.Alright but the fact we disagree on this really says something about our feelings on this topic as a whole. Basically itll be impossible to get through to each other in this debate. Haha I guess this just means Im too quick to question the grounding of others opinions but thats just a bad habit of mine. gt Out of curiosity whom would you call chaoticgood?In One Piece? Kureha Franky maybe Zoro ? and some others Im too lazy to think of right now. Outside of One Piece? Perhaps Roy Mustang from Fullmetal Alchemist if Im remembering him correctly. I think Netero from Hunter x Hunter may fit that bill. I find it hard to label characters on that DnD scale though. I feel that its a bit too limiting but its not like I can think of something better to label with. Pgt Except that he does.How so? He was going to ignore Nami until she hopped off the building she was on and told him she was a navigator. He wasnt exactly chatting it up with the people he was working with at Baratie. There are a lot of examples of him not going out of his way to seek companionship from locals and whatnot. Hes usually pretty focused on just continuing his journey and adventuring really only going out of his way to befriend people if theyre weird help him or throw a party for him have an interesting history or are friends of friends.gt Yeah me too.

I like the idea of melted plastic to create tools and such though I think that it would be too similar to Mr. s fruit. Candy or food would be interesting though Im not quite sure if I would want to eat myself for sustenance. I would also have to beware of Big Mom and Jewelry Bonney.Plant and wood would be interesting because it would be very strategic. I imagine Wood being used much like Yamato from the Naruto series in the sense that it would be used to build cages bridges or used as an attack. Plant on the other hand would be like Usopps green stars but you could be powered up by the sun in a supermanlike way.,OnePiece,d580rru,1,t5_2rfz5

8382869,0,t3_4udj8x,Zoro has been matched against weaklings and been fighting in favorable conditions since Fishmen Island. Sanji hasnt. Lets look at his new world fights so far.First against Vergo he was extremely injured from when Nami was in his body. Its mentioned by him how injured he is twice I think meaning Oda wants us to keep this in mind or else why keep mentioning it? His second fight was against Doflamingo without knowing his powers. Remember this is the Doflamingo that nearly slaughtered an entire island while fighting against Luffy and Law who were going all out and even forced Luffy to take a ten minute recess from the fight while Law was forced out of the fight almost completely. Theres no way Sanji or even Zoro stood any chance against him and if you think either one did then I want some of what youre snorting.His third fight more of skirmish was spoilerss the head of his family. Sanji landed several solid hits on him and although his dad also landed some hits they didnt really do a whole lot of damage to Sanji. They were mostly things that caught him off guard because he wasnt familiar with the technology or fighting style. But then Sanji lost but that was really because Sanji didnt want to drag other people into their fight and the dad didnt mind stabbing through one of his subordinates which is something Sanji probably would never expect with him being so honorable and whatnot. If it werent for his dad fighting dirty the fight could have lasted longer and would have shown us much more of what Sanji is capable of and remind us why hes considered a powerhouse in the Straw Hats.,OnePiece,d5penon,3,t5_2rfz5

They survive in exile for twelve years Prospero learning powerful sorcery in the meantime then enact a plot to kill his traitorous brother before he has a crisis of conscience.

8460676,0,t1_d5yj0x6,Its good to know youve been to the future. I didnt think time travel existed until now but Im convinced.Why do people think theres a connection? Because Brook had a reaction to the Vinsmoke name that given its wording seemed derived from an old memory. He then very obviously clammed up about it shortly after there was a whole panel dedicated to showing he was keeping quiet hell when the crew were talking about the Vinsmokes. He didnt share what he remembered despite the fact it would be incredibly importantrelevant to finding Sanji and. Its an extremely outofcharacter moment since hes usually very eager and forthcoming about his knowledge about countries rulers etc like when he spoke about Wano and the Flying Dutchman. His reaction made it appear the Vinsmokes were a personal matter.Following that the only time he said anything about the Vinsmoke name was when he angrily asked Pekoms if that was a royal familys name and mentioned he knew they once ruled the North Blue with an iron fist. And he was correct. Reiju claimed he was mistaken when he wasntthe Vinsmokes dont rule the North Blue anymore. Theyre not the royal family they once were back in Brooks day. And none of this explains his reaction in the slightest unless you ignore Brooks personality entirely. It just adds to the mystery.So if youve got a better theory than he probably didnt think it was relevant which is bull because Brooks never witheld before as to why he hasnt revealed what hes hiding about the Vinsmokes and his memory then go on. Thats the point.,OnePiece,d5z4bza,2,t5_2rfz5

8594445,0,t1_d6fgdce,Im not that interested about where youre from but thank you I guess for telling me?You can swear if you want to I never said anything about you swearing I think you need to stop misinterpret things I write. It seems right now that you sort of hear what you want to hear.Again I wasnt against you using mate at the end of your comments I just claimed that it sounded ironic. Feel free to keep writing mate I wont stop you.Just because no one has called you out yet doesnt mean that my accusations are invalid. Youre telling me that if no one detects you youre not doing anything bad? I dont think it works that way.Let me give you an example My friend has been robbing people on the street for about a month now but since no one has called him out on this he isnt a robber. I dont think it works that way whatever the case is. And I have a theory about why you havent been called out yet. Im guessing you have a semismall youtube channel with gt subscribers am I correct? Of these possible gt viewers there will be a very small percentage of people who are there because they dislike clickbait videos. They are there because they either dont know what clickbait means like you even though Ive told you I think twice now? or because they like it. Possibly there may be a third group even smaller that knows what clickbait means and either dont care or are there ironically. Of course they are there for your content in the videos aswell I atleast hope that you have content and not just the titles.When I read And even if i did use clickbait when is it wrong using capitalised letters to attract viewers. When making a video infact when anyone makes a video they want to make it as attractive as possible without using big boobs on thumbnails or what not I got a tad bit sad that you admittingly said that you use clickbait titles the literal sentence after you tried to defend yourself with an asspull of an argument. So I guess were at the stage where you confess youre using clickbait titles now we just need to come to the part where you realise that you shouldnt do it and focus on the content instead.The only reason I called you a keyboard warrior is that you called me a keyboard warrior. The only difference was that you used it wrongly odd huh? You having a wrong definition of a word.. Im starting to see a pattern and I used it correctly. And you took offense at that?I have given you a mean to express yourself in a somewhat negative way? The whole purpose of me writing this is to make you realise that you had a clickbait title check and have you stop using them. Nothing else. Well... maybe to pass time..If you want something from someone its proper manners to introduce yourself first and I dont really see the point in having you know my age but if it makes you feel better. I was born on the th of January  which makes me  years old.let the round begin ding ding ding ding we have been going on with this for  comments. Were not really beginning now. You even said And u say im a keyboard warrior when i said u actually could of been a cool guy but yet u come back for more rounds like someone who just wants to pass the time. just  lines above this.,OnePiece,d6fwaak,1,t5_2rfz5

So far the commanders are living up to the hype.  I think doflamingo was really the highest level you could be before entering Admiral territory. Jack attacked sengoku tsuru and fujitora at the same time and lived. He also fought the  mink kings endlessly for a few days straight and wasnt even visibly tired. Cracker took an unexpected gear  haki attack like it was nothing and threw luffy back almost immediately after. Marco was able to fight against the  original admirals all in one day and the Gorosei considered him a threat to Blackbeard. Jozu was able to fight pretty evenly with aokiji before he got distracted and has one of the best strength feats ever. Vista fought against Mihawk and came out of the war almost unscathed. Ben Beckman literally stopped kizaru in his tracks for a few minutes just by threatening him.I think luffy is going to need to step it up just to fight against the commandersadmirals before he can even think about the yonkou.Also kaido and big mamas commanders together are Cracker Jack haha,OnePiece,d6nwheb,34,t5_2rfz5

Are we even watching the same show!?! Rayleigh was stated to be  times stronger than Luffy when Luffy was on Sabaody. But Rayleigh is old now and not even the captain.

8689389,0,t1_d6rkeca,Flaws are subjective and no my argument wouldnt argue every subjective flaw away. It doesnt apply to plot holes it doesnt apply to issues people may have with designs or locations it doesnt apply to character traits some people may not like. All my argument applies to is the context of this discussion. In that calling what Oda writes as the plot something that only serves to delay a climax insinuates that he doesnt really care about the content the fluff in your words that youre complaining about and is only writing it to fill space and milk money. gt I think we can agree that compared to everything One Piece has to offer this is one of the things that could be removed and no value would be lost. In other words it kinda sucks if you compare it to the rest of the show.No we cant agree on that. I wouldnt want anything removed from the manga anyway let alone Luffys idiotic antics getting him into trouble like they should get him into the guy is lucky enough to be alive as it is and the antagonists being competent enough to be able to at least delay and inconvenience the Straw Hat Pirates instead of skipping straight into climactic battles.

He at least would have put up a respectable fight. Sanji kicked a few times then boom defeated. Alls Im sayin is Sanji needs to either show his real power or get a power up because Oda has been shitting on him since the timeskip.

8798154,0,t3_50mz5z,PREDICTION TIME!Pleas skip if you dont want to read conjectures. Long shot but Im guessing the wedding is sai and baby ...cause why not.While I expected biscuit to get up I did not expect him to pop out like a new born chick. No wonder urogue lost he probably went ham on the armor and didnt realize there was a guy inside. Oh well. No need to say it but were all hoping for that lucky shot that hits cracker. Then I thought theres no way you make it in the new world being that weak. Maybe hes like Blackbeard who can take damage but really feels pain. Thats my guess anyways. I wouldnt be surprised if he turned the whole landscape into a cracker and became a super mecha cracker. I eventually see the battle going three ways. Luffy wins with his hidden second power up. He loses as time runs out on the haki and is captured given a chance to meet up with jinbe?. Nami steps in and saves him but cracker is hurt too they meet again later...Is anyone else worried about how In depth Pedro seems to know the system? Im going to go out on a limb and say somethings going to happen with him where hes recognized. Pekoms body should be washing ashore any minute now so that could prove interesting. Im sure bege will make his move soon too. Bropper and carrot will stumble upon something like the prison the ponegylph treasure etc which will be vital laterSeeing the other two vinsmoke brothers shouldnt be that crazy considering sanji was going toe to toe with his dad but Im sure theyre a force to be reckoned with. Itll probably come down to sanji seeing his friend hurt that will light the fuse for him to go all out.

8876642,0,t3_51rk96,I think if luffy awakens his fruit it will be some inner body change because his fruit changes his inner properties. Doffys fruit diddnt change his body it changed things on the outside so his fruit awakened also changed things on the outside by turning it into strings. Also a Zoan has inner body changes so awakened it changes their body. I think luffys fruit being called the gum gum fruit and not the rubber rubber fruit is for a reason. gum can also have sticky properties so maybe he can stick to things awakened. Not sure how this will help in combat but seems most logical. Turning swords and what not into rubber wont be a powerup now that we have haki to stop swords.,OnePiece,d7euieh,1,t5_2rfz5

Big Mom is very excited for this wedding solely because of the opportunity to eat sweets so I can imagine a future role for the wedding cake. A poisoned cake would be an interesting trigger for all sorts of events. Of course Big Mom would hardly be affected by such a feeble attempt at an assassination but it would certainly cause her to snap. Personally I predict that Luffy will destroy the wedding cake which will serve as a declaration of his desire to have Sanji return and as a means of earning Big Moms anger.

But the thing is still that the whole timeskip was to develop the characters and mainly their powers and skill levels to be onpar with enemies past the Red Line. Not showing that off isnt exactly what I would call character focus. Yes he had more focus than Zoro in the Punk Hazard arc but that was also a kind of weak arc it just filled the gap to get Doflamingo story going it focused Trafalgar more than a lot of crew members. And yeah I do agree the Franky Senor Pink was really good. But I still feel like Odas trying to keep  people in focus from the crew right now and Luffy is always one of those four the second is usually Zoro or Sanji the third trafalgar and the fourth is whichever of the rest of the crew that happens to be placed there. I was more character development where theyre actually doing things. I loved seeing reunion in Zou because it highlighted large parts of the crew without Luffy its something we havent really seen much of at all posttimeskip. I just want the crew to flesh out their training and timeskip skills.

I hope neither die and I dont think anyone in Shokugeki will die anyway since its not that kind of show but I could see Jouichiro taking the high road and losing something important as its befitting of his character. Hohenheim from FmaB and Kyouraku from Bleach also fit that kind of bill more or less. I dont know if the messianic archetype covers the laidback zen quality of these characters and I dont know if the sage is the most fitting archetype either.

9092447,0,t1_d84qwj6,Yes and no I jumped to conclusions. PreTS Sanji could not have defeated Don Krieg. The amount of punishment that he put Luffy through would have taken out anyone who didnt have a specific devil fruit where they could absorb the damage like Luffys rubber body did. As well the poison needles and explosions were overpowered. It is one of the reasons why Don Krieg is my favorite villain due to how reallife he was compared to the other East Blue pirates. By reallife Im referring to how he was Batman. A normal person using gadgets armor and his intelligence to defeat others. Kuroobi is stronger than Don Krieg due to his natural fishman endurance and karate. He even says that Sanji is an aboveaverage human during their fight.The question posed by OP was If the SHs traveled back in time to fight Luffys old enemies who would be strongest each of the SHs be able to defeat?Saying that postTS Sanji could defeat Caesar is laughable as Luffy had to use Armament Haki grizzly magnum to defeat him. Sanji does not have an ability or move that rivals that level of offense.

Sanjis comment when fighting Vergo wasnt that he was already so worn out  damaged but that just trying to kick Vergo made his leg feel like it was cracking.Vergo definitely seems to be stronger than Pica so Sanji fought opponent that was stronger than the one Zoro faced. However I think its hard to argue that the gap between Pica and Vergo is so great that Zoro could effortless beat Pica and Sanjis legs were breaking against Vergo and somehow Sanji and Zoro are similar strength levels.,OnePiece,d85hwyx,3,t5_2rfz5

The point wasnt whether or not they were made by man but why let such powerful weapons go free in the first place.gt Following this theory WG should be on BBs heels from the moment he stole WBs DF  which apparently isnt happening.This is easily explained away considering the fact that BB kept which devil fruit power he had hidden until he joined the WG. The WG saw he had it though decided to try and ally with BB rather than kill him. Best to keep the fruit in sight rather than out in the wild for who knows how long. Hell its entirely possible the WG didnt know Whitebeards crew had found the fruit in the first place. They made the mistake of assuming BB didnt know about the fruits ability to absorb other fruits.

Agree or disagree either way it wont change my perspective and I wont change yours.That sounds to me like willful ignorance given that there is objectively more to his character than that. You can say thats his importance or thats what you got out of him but to say that that is his only function is objectively wrong.gt As for patterns whats wrong with looking for them? Fiction as a whole uses patterns to better convey themes. Look at Dressrosa its no exaggeration thay it was supposed to parallel Alabasta there are tons of points going for that one in fact theres TONNE TONNES Ill see myself out. Patterns are a fun way to look at things and help formulate theories.Theres nothing wrong with patterns as a whole. My problem is with arbitrary patterns that are built off flimsy details and nitpicking. Dressrosa had very obvious parallels like literally to the point where Oda drew panels based off of Alabasta. Like Doffys defeat vs. Crocodiles defeat. Or the fact that characters got little narrative boxes after defeating executives. He has never done that elsewhere outside of repeating gags.I also dont like the idea of making theories just for the sake of making them. They should always have a solid base to stand on or otherwise they just feel delusional in nature. Thats just me though.,OnePiece,d8na617,1,t5_2rfz5

It would be  his resolve to fight Luffy at Water   his apology to the crew postEnies Lobby and  his resolve to fight Trebol and Sugar just for his honors sake. Sanjis has to be so far his refusal to fight Kalifa. Also I want to throw in one more for Luffy and Zoro. Romance Dawn at the beginning of the series he says hes going to become pirate king and if he dies at least he tried. Zoro when he discarded his pride to ask Mihawk for training. That imo is Zoros most defining moment because in doing that he accepted the full responsibility of being vice captain and fully put Luffys dream above his own.

Two teeny tiny things though  because of the painterly effect Sanjis arms look out of focus with whats around them I know its hard to sharpen that look to match the foreground items but even sharpening of the edge and maybe a slight texture on the skin would help and  the pouring arm is in a very unnatural position to pour coffee. I get the impression that you tried to make it fit into the page but it looks awkward and also like hes resting his elbow on the counter behind while almost knocking over the grinder at the same time. Raising his elbow to  degrees or slightly higher than his hand would make it more realistic and disassociate it from the counter in the background.

Edit What if Pudding has a devil fruit the pudding pudding fruit and shes using the pudding to basically change her appearance like Cracker did with his Biscuit fruit? Pudding is probably Fugly and is manipulating sanji because sanji actually thinks shes attractive. This whole chapter has been masking identities Reiju seeming like shes evil but actually good Sanji wearing the king Louis metal mask cracker hiding his true form with his DF Sanji wearing the mask to hide his beaten up face and now probably pudding hiding her real form.

9591009,0,t1_d9v8dcq,The thing is I feel like whoever says there are DFs that make you weaker just isnt creative enough. Its kinda like this concept from Pokemon. Luffys fruit is a decent example. By default all it really does is give you some extra tankiness... but this is the OP universe Zoros about as durable as Luffy without any powers so thats not really that much of an upgrade. Its Luffys creativity with the fruit that makes it cool.Kaku is another great example and what makes him such a BAMF to me is that hes figuring stuff out so quickly haha giraffes arent exactly the most imposing animal but on top of the strengthdurability upgrade he figures out how to integrate his new forms into his preexisting skillset.Theres another fruit that pops up much later on that I think is the perfect example. It seems so dumb in theory but the eater actually uses it in some pretty interesting ways. For those wondering Im talking about Spoilerss Senior Pinks swim fruit. Not really that interesting on the surface it pretty much just lets you swim in stuff you couldnt before while making it so you cant in what you could.

It will tie up his origin of being the weakling of the family especially when he beat the shit out of one of them and had a fair chance vs his legendary father until he started using people as shields.This is my tinfoil theory A powerful group will make an appearance to aid them against a Yonko. There is a significant dragon symbol that appears a few times. One on Sanji on a cover one on a member of Shanks crew aaaaand Gin. Sanji is the mina person of the arc so that is covered Gin is thought of dead but has a Chekhovs gun of meeting Sanji on the grand line. Shanks is the only person to do nothing sine the timeskip so he may make an appearance soon to set up the whole  Emperors saga thing. I actually see this more likely to happen with any of the other SH groups but the mark being on Sanji makes me currently think it may happen during this arc.,OnePiece,d9w72ci,1,t5_2rfz5

9634183,0,t3_5cu89a,In my honest opinion Im not sure one piece has managed to remain as captivating as it once was. Before the time skip Id have sworn the plot was perfect but there are three or four things ive been pretty disappointed with.  Before the time skip we had  really awesome Luffy arcs Amazon Lily Impel Down Marineford. All of which were amazing. After the time skip I think we all expected a lot more chances for the crew members to show their stuff but tbh its still been mostly way too luffy focused. Oda has made all the crew members really appealing but if they never get to show their stuff and have their time in the sun especially after all this time its pretty upsetting. I was watching some one piece amvs the other day and nearly cried because the last really emotionally badass scene zoro had was vs kuma so many years ago.  Haki flaws. Haki has opened up some serious issues in the story. Especially with the question of whether a two year time skip was necessary or not if everyone else all the supernovas and relevant enemies were all going to have haki anyway. I wont go too deep into it since im assuming everyone is familiar with all of the issues anyway. Repetitive plot This wasnt an issue pre time skip but recently theres been a lot of the same formula over and over again. You have luffy befriending the princess crew saving the kingdomisland luffy fighting the main bad guy..blah blah blah.  My main issue which is mostly a repeat of number  is that...in the beginning of one piece...it didnt really matter whether luffy or zoro fought you knew they could both deal with whoever the enemy was especially if zoro was  healed. Later on Luffy got pretty much every main boss fight because their crew was small...they were on the brink of life and death...and the deciding fight needed to be decided by Luffy. But I mean..after a  year training time skip...youd think you could toss zoro sanji or maybe even robin a shichibukai to fight and take care of. Luffy is the captain...and its about time he got to really act as a captain and let his crew members take care of things that dont quite need his hand to take care of. When he fights every important fight it makes things awkward because his crew doesnt get much to do.Weve seen impel down marineford etc. We know luffy is strong. No one questions that. Lets see what the crew has in store. nami learned all that weather knowledge ussop had his own progress brooke found his own path of the sword using his soul power that sets him apart from zoro franky with his vegapunk knowledge and chopper with his medical knowledge and lets not forget to mention robin who was with the fking dragon. Oda has all of this to work with but all we get is Luffy every time...it gets old. I never thought id ever be bored of Luffy but its happening and its not good.P.S. Im not very happy with the current sanji thing. Weve saved nami weve saved robin weve saved  princesses...but when the fk did sanji become a girlprincess. No wonder Zoro isnt here itd ruin their rivalry if he saw this.,OnePiece,da0m0ut,2,t5_2rfz5

9973006,0,t3_5hwk76,OK first of all Luffy is the strongest. How is it possible to overhype a character that much? Just because Zoro defeated Pica who turned out to be a let down. Luffys feats are way more impressive.In anycase I dont think there will be a year of Zoro. Oda is not going to pull another secret past revealed plot twist  years in a row. That would be  original. Besides there will be so many characters on Wano including the samurai and many supernovas Law Kidd Apoo Killer etc. so Oda will likely want to give them plenty of panel time. Not to mention that unlike Dressrosa and the current arc all the Strawhats will be there. They will need panel time as well. You think Oda will ignore all of those people to concentrate on Zoro?Just because Sanji has his own arc doesnt mean Zoro will have his too. With Sanji Oda himself mentioned he would play a big part in the following year. With Zoro its  fanboys imagination going wild. I think he will have his moment as usual perhaps involving Ryuga sword and likely a battle as well but I dont believe he will be the main focus of the arc.,OnePiece,db7id3v,1,t5_2rfz5

9976557,0,t1_db7ypn5,Someone somewhere else in this post made a good point he did to Monet exactly what he did to the Octopus swordsman on Fishman Island. Essentially intimidate them because he doesnt want to fight someone significantly weaker than himself unless he has to a la Mihawk when he first meets Zoro. Only where Zoro did the final blow to the Octopus guy because he didnt heed his threat Tashigi interfered as Monet was about to retaliate despite his threat not to.Tashigi then made the false connection that Zoro does not like to fight women. But as we know he doesnt fight Tashigi because she looks too much like Kuina and didnt fight Monet because he found her beneath him. We also know hes fine fighting women because he deals with plenty of them when first encountering Baroque Works  including a woman dressed as a nun with a child.But after the Timeskip he took after Mihawk.

10114679,0,t3_5kptgd,. I dont think he is half fishman. Oda spent a lot of effort hiding Jacks teeth from us untill the reveal that he was halffishman. That implies to me that sharp teeth are a telltale sign that someone is half fishman. Dillinger also had sharp teeth. . He could be halfgiant but other than his size what evidence is there to support this? We know that Oda is fine with making normal humans massive whitebeard so unless it is somehow related to the bigmomgiantstoryline I doubt it would be relevant. . Wano is going to be based on Japan. I think it is much more likely that Oda would base Kadios design and fruit off something from Japaneese mythology rather than a  pretty obscure figure from Greek mythology. The Oni theroy seems way more likley seeing as Oni are important figures in Japaneese myth. His design also closly resembles one also uses an iron spiked club in line with Oni. One of the abilities of Oni is the ability to shape shift  if he could shapeshift into different animals that would explain his epithet which could otherwise be easily explained by his crew the beast pirates. . I dont see how tattoos are evidence his skin is hard? Tattoos need to puncture the skin to insert the ink so it implies the opposite. In general I think people are taking the couldnt be killed and suicide is his hobby thing to literally  i think it was just to emphasize that this is one tough motherfucker. If you were to take seriously that he couldnt be killed then that would leave two options for powers that he must have.  A power which made him truly immortal or resurrected him whenever he died. Or.  A power which prevented him from actually eating a second devil fruit. Something like Cavendishs split personality which would take over and prevent Kaido from completing the act. If he was being kept as a slave to a different personality that could show why he was seeking out someone who could defeat it. ,OnePiece,dbpy906,21,t5_2rfz5

Specially Luffys since Shanks already gave up an arm to save him.Why is Jinbe allowed to be inside the castle though? A couple chapters back we saw a newspaper saying that he backed away from leaving big moms crew so maybe that was true and he gave up on his chances to peacefully abandon whole cake island whitout taking down big mom?

Then I think more than a year later I remembered that I really liked a lot of the world of One Piece and I wanted something quick and easy to watch so I picked it up again. I actually really enjoyed the Impel Down and Sabody arc and the Whitebeard war was very cool as well. I got to the timeskip and immediately I felt put off by a lot of small things that kind of piled up and then quit at the aforementioned point in Dressrosa.

10179518,0,t3_5lqle6,To add to what has already been said. Back in the early days it was way easier to identify the new nakama. They had something different to them and also the fact that Luffy literally always asked them to join very early into the arc. For example Zoro Sanji and Chopper. I think later on with Robin Franky and Brook it became more of a logical conclusion of the super long arcs. I remember Robin being the only crew member who people were surprised she joined. I was as well with my like  years at the time because it felt like she may appear later on in the story but her joining was just too absurd with all the backstory in the Baroque Works and Vivi. I think nowadays it has become just a bit too hard to pinpoint the newest crew member. There is so much going on compared to the early days that you just dont have the aha moment knowing Xcharacter will join. Will they stay friends and reappear further down the story? Will they join the pirate alliance? Will they maybe just like Vivi stay where they are and just have that bond? Or will they actually join the crew?  At least for me its gotten harder to tell over the last  years thats why I dont really like to speculate that much about it. The story is at a point where I sometimes feel a new character that would join the crew now would on one hand be awesome but on the other hand sadly have missed out on literally over half of the crews adventure and would never be seen like the core crew setting their goals as they entered the grand line or when they were seperated for  years.,OnePiece,dbxwkpu,2,t5_2rfz5

Hes probably just misleading us by keeping that leg out of view last chapter and has some other ideas up his sleeve.Also it might be possible that he actually did walk out of it if Big Mom explained the punishments.

Garps potential for Admiral also resounds that he was a lot stronger than Smoker.as for his fight against Shiki most people dont seem to read the context Marineford is a symbol for justice destroying it is anti to the marines message its why Akainu and Sengoku stressed it so much during the war Sengoku also mentioned it in the fight against Shiki. weve also seen what an Admiral level fight results in massive collateral damage Akainu and Aokijis fight messed up Punk Hazard and the fight against Shiki only destroyed half of Marineford despite Shikis DF being more capable of collateral damage that shows that Garp and Sengoku together were able to not only end the fight in their favour but also limited the amount of damage done to Marineford.,OnePiece,dcbenf6,2,t5_2rfz5

Since the art of fighting has evolved since then and people find new and better ways to maximize their training. But mostly because there are more fighters now and that means more competition  better results.This can probably be applied to the One Piece universe aswell. When Roger was pirate king there were X pirates.In the preset time there might be X pirates and that would mean a  times increase in strong pirates.

I think Sanji vs Ichiji would be the match up with Sanji winning. Out of all the siblings I think Yonji would be the weakest thus Reiju taking third with Ichiji at first Sanji and Niji tied for second strongest. But I think out of everyone in the family I think Judge is the weakest one.

10537752,0,t1_dd1qr4x,First of all this is an old post second of all I appreciate that you either are very good at guessing or have researched my posts because I really do like these characters. The basis of Bellamys character is a search to find acceptance which is very easily perceived by fans Initially including me as a wish to be viewed as someone cool. Upon reading further and discovering his honestly quite touching dressrosa scenes this belief was shattered. However the reason I still dislike him is that he is still to put it promptly a dick. He has not changed one bit in his actual character value and the only difference from then to now is that he has realized that Doflamingo is not someone worthy of his praise. He is still weak annoying and to me very uninteresting. He still has a shot at redeeming himself and if he has a cause the next time he meets Luffy I will perhaps change my opinion. Meanwhile Hachi ever since introduced has been portrayed as a goofy and very trusting character and when you further get to know him through for an example his lovely cover page arc you learn that he did not wish to fight and that he is very selfless. Also I tend to side with minorities that are clearly being discriminated against as I find it easier to relate to them.  I do not even need to explain why Bon Clay has redeemed himself considering the multiple times he sacrificed himself for a former enemy in impel down. The issue you are making in your reasoning is that you are intentionally only bringing up instances of these characters before their significant evolution of characteristics. This makes for an invalid argument when discussing characters growing as I could just as easily portray Bellamy in an equally bad light by completely ignoring his development.,OnePiece,dd2kk7f,1,t5_2rfz5

10676752,0,t1_ddh7prl,I made that argument because it showed that WB retreated from a fight too. the point of mentioning it wasnt to make WB look bad but to show that retreating from a fight you dont want to be a part of is not the same as running away because youre scared. Aokiji and Kizaru didnt really care much either. Aokiji attacked WB the first time because he was supposed to freeze the bay which he did he simply took an opportunity to take a shot at WB too if he truly cared he would have followed through afterwards too. his second attack was right when WB was about to use his quake to damage Marineford and as Sakazuki and Sengoku mentioned a number of times the Admiral where there to protect the place. so Aokijis motives for the second time were the same as AkainusKizaru also took an opportunistic shot against WB and was blocked by Marco he then reported back to the Giants about being cautious of aerial attacks from Marco. Kizaru never engaged WB again for a fight so he didnt care much either. ,OnePiece,ddh85tj,1,t5_2rfz5

Luffy and Sanji should be having the time of their lives here  . He probably didnt use King Kong anything bc nami was nearby or he didnt want to make a bigger scene lol or he was underestimating his opponent again which I kinda dont like. Actually Doffy tanks G way better than Cracker does hes just better with his fruit and haki so he was able to keep up with Luffys overwhelming strength and speed through numbers.

10889986,0,t3_5vksov,Jinbe and Smoker and possibly Tashigi will join the crew.Mainly due to the way One Piece was originally supposed to be it wasnt supposed to be super long series so things which appeared in the East Blue Saga hold alot more weight to me when predictions are concerned. That is the main reason I believed Jinbe would join as soon as I knew he was an ally I expected him to join mainly due to the focus they put on him back in Baratie arc. He was the only named Warlord outside of Mihawk made me think he was more important than any other warlord and had some special role.Same for Smoker. Smoker seems prime for the candidate of baddy turned goody he was focused on in East Blue and his morals ideals have been questioned as series goes on he is basically becoming more of a pirate everyday. Also something which the Straw hats lack to some degree is a baddy turned goody you have Robin and Franky who were both enemies but they never seemed as dedicated to being bad guys Smoker isnt either but in the terms of opponent he is. Also he is logia which hasnt been represented on the crew his strength has been portrayed at around equal to the high end of the crew and his potential threat to Luffy has been drastically decreased too. At the very least I dont think Smoker will stay an enemy.Also he looks really cool next to Luffy and I just really want him to join ,OnePiece,de383kb,6,t5_2rfz5

11007663,0,t3_5x5c7e,In the early days of the Viz translation I think the translators were still trying to get the feel of the manga. The dialogue is a bit clunky at times and the characterization suffers a little for example Luffy seems a lot more mature and articulate than the idiot he really is IMO for the first couple of volumes. There are a couple of weird spellings and names I would probably put this down to them not being informed of the English spelling and trying to figure it out themselves. To preserve continuity they keep these which a lot of fans find dislike.Nowadays the Viz translation is great I feel that theyve got just the right balance between accurately conveying what the characters are saying while also making it sound natural in English.Im probably in the minority here but I think the Viz volumes are probably the best way of going about reading the series the colored scans are absolutely gorgeous but there is some questionable dialogue in the online scans.

11142262,0,t1_deuxwau,As for WB at Impel Down I like to think he had a different plan on how to deal with the forces there that we didnt get to see but rolled with the whole chaos Luffy had spread.As for Shiliew though its important to note that Shiliew met with Blackbeard on Level  before Magellan took out the crew they spoke and seemingly did not fight and then again beforehand Shiliew was seen destroying a surveillance camera station where he presumably got his hands on the antidote. Then Magellan took out BB and crew on Level  and Shiliew cures them.So it seems pretty clear to me from the order of events that BB and crew rolled into Impel Down ready to put their original plan into action but then Shiliew came and told them what was up. So BB called a lateral and Shiliew wanting to escape Impel Down joined the BB crew then and there. BB and crew then played possum by getting one shot by Magellan in order to be able to sneak around after they were cured that way they can go all the way down to the bottom level without having to fight their way down and they would be left to cause what mischief they were up to before they made their exit. ,OnePiece,deuypyb,4,t5_2rfz5

If you have a problem with people just complaining all the time you can always try and convince them that their complaint is baseless. Either that or just ignore itBesides we also have absolutely no input over the quality of the anime the western market for Toei is completely disposable.

11195045,0,t3_5zt9cu,Hes been with Luffy since Impel Down and is both a loyal friend and great help to Luffy since he saved Luffy after Ace died. Then in Fishman Island right after the timeskip we get his backstory and Jinbe fights alongside the crew against Hordy not much of a fight but still. The scene where Jinbe donates blood after the fight to Luffy is still one of my favorite scenes in the entire series I thought it was almost criminal to not have Jinbe join right after. I can understand why though it would be weird to have him join for the Punk HazardDressrosaZou arcs and with his joining being postponed we had the same number of Straw Hats in DressrosaWCI  different ones for each.Most of the reasons Ive seen against Jinbe joining are pretty subjective too. The main ones are that hes too boring or too strong both poor reasons imo. One of the biggest reasons I think Jinbe should join is to see the status of the fishmen elevated in the OP world since from what we saw in Sabaody theyre thought of as nonhuman.

However they stopped Clover specifically before he said the name of the kingdom. The Gorosei could refuse to speak with Clover at all or order the CP to shoot him on the spot.gt laws amp regulationThat is a good point but one main theme of the series is freedom. Laws and regulations are opposite to it. gt  people with power can amp will live however they want regardless the society.Once Luffy becomes the Pirate King he will be in power but he wont be like the Celestial Dragons. He will continue to be the same good Luffy that lives however he wants but he wont do harm to innocent people and he will continue to fight villains that harm his friends. King Riku from Dressrosa was so well trusted by the citizens that all the citizens in the country were prepared to give all the money to the royal family in the middle of the night after a sudden request. He was in power but he helped people. That is a Lawful Good king.gt That is a reason why this series is unique because the main characters are by definition  both within their world and ours  legitimate villains.The main characters may be villains by definition as they are not respecting the laws of the world but they are Chaos Good. I wouldnt brand them as villains as they dont do bad stuff to innocent civilians. A real villainous main character is for example Light Yagami from Death Note.A lot of things I mentioned may be in real life or have an equivalent in real life but that doesnt make them good. If a king of a country doesnt care at all about the lives of his citizens he is not a good he is a villain.,OnePiece,df1y6nf,0,t5_2rfz5

11246976,0,t3_6075wg,Im going to take a slightly different approach then what Ive seen in all the comments so far. Im going to answer based on how successful the villains were at riling up antagonizing Luffy during their arc. Worst Enel. He didnt really do much to Luffy. The capture of Merry and half the crew was just his business as usual Luffy never had a real vendetta. Now its been a minute since I reread Skypia but I dont recall any moments of Luffy being mad at Enel until after they had already begun to fight and Luffys primary motivation throughout the arc had nothing to do with Enel. Best Hody. Hear me out here. Hody kidnapped members of the crew directly called Luffy out in front of the whole nation and even dared to call himself the Pirate King to Luffys face. If it hadnt been for Jinbe Luffy would have likely played right into Hodys hands. Luffy even stated he didnt care about being a hero for the island he just wanted to kick Hodys ass. Those are my thoughts. I think Enel is far from the worst villain in the series and while I love the FI arc Doffy and Croc are just two examples of much better villains. I think a case can be made for both of them in terms of doing a better job at literally antagonizing Luffy but is there anyone who did a worse job then Enel? This was fun.

11278308,0,t1_dfaa4vj,I kind of assume that Luffy will have a similar fate to Roger. There are definitely signs that point to it. From Rob Lucci telling him that Gear nd will decrease his life span and Ivankov cautioning the same when he injected him with hormones TWICE. Spoilers Even now we know that Big Mom can literally take peoples life span away in chunks and the current plan laid out by Capone leaves Luffy as a huge target. Honestly I doubt Chopper could heal what her power does to a person.A lot of the signs point toward Luffy being in a similar set of circumstances as Roger. Knowing full well that he is going to die and making a difficult choice because of it. I will say though that I believe that Oda plans for Luffy to surpass Roger in some way. Most likely taking down the WG and starting a new era of freedom for all.

Thats nice.His names Handsome.gtRight. Duval. Thats his name.Sure if you say so.gtSeriously what the fuck is with that newspaperSorry but the thing Buggys received that Mr.  is reading is an entirely different matter.gtAnd now  old guys are talking about who should be the new Warlords.The Five Elder Stars. Youve seen them before. Actually run the World Government though the Celestial Dragons are still a higher authority.gtHuh so Garp just abandoned the military?I think Garps a really interesting deep character. He like many marines sacrificed a great deal in the name of trying to do something for the good of the world. But it was finally too much for him.gtOoh but he nominated Aokiji thats good.Definitely the safest choice.gt...I really didnt take Luffy to be one for symbolism.

Well really you already have because youve already read the next few.gtUmm...what is that in the background of Kidds place?The New World is a crazy place.gtWhat the fuck is that thing?!The New World is a crazy place.gtSo the New World has an island of lightning.

I dont see that going well.Well theres some logic to it that might make sense in the future.gtSo...New World is just x crazier than Paradise?Yes. Very yes.gtSo Moria just...dissapeared? The fuck?Thats strong material for materializing. But even more so the stuff Doffy says.gtAnd Chopper went back to that island he just left?Im not massively swayed by adorable appearances but adorable actions? Dear god Chopper is so lovable here.gtSo let me guess hes going to music his way out of there?Maybe? Maybe not? Youll see.gtAnd now hes going to get some magic seeds too.Well theyre way cooler than that.gtSo hes going to train the person whos going to defeat him.I really love the thing about how Zoro is only able to do this because he found a cause greater than his own ambition. His character development was so subtle but has made such a massive difference.gtAh so that was the real message. Makes sense.Honestly? Awesome way to announce a timeskip.gtOh. Thats quite the easy way for him to get better at Sovereign Haki.Well Ill just tell you now . of the time we call it Conquerors Haki. Everyone does.gtmost people have a tendency to develop inequally let me guess Luffys going to be great at armament and terrible at observation?Maybe? Youll see.Also some thoughts on Haki I really like that Oda designed it to be very specific abilities instead of a generic life energy power thing. Not to disparage those when done well like Nen in HxH its awesome. But that kind of thing wouldnt fit in One Piece being introduced so late as fights are already about Devil Fruits and general fighting styles. Also the forms of Haki are explanations for things that in a lot of series just go unexplained. Things like stuff having more hardness or durability people being able to sense attacks coming in some vague way or knocking people out with their presence.gtAfterthoughts Well this was quite the way to cap off the first part of One Piece. Its cool to see everyone training to get stronger so Im going to be expecting a lot posttimeskip!Well Ill tell you now. By and large posttimeskip is something of a slow burn.

Associating him with a major villain paints him in a villainous light.  for joiningAlthough he is laid back he has a very serious personality and doesnt like following orders.

And job is really not a way to discredit Sanjis power. Law is the strongest fighter captain and main doctor of his crew. And there is some rival thing betn them. Oda had no reason to make Zoro comment while Luffy said that Sanji was  men worth. I took that as a sign for their ongoing rivalry. And Zoro has said that he wont follow a weak captain.

11597369,0,t3_65bje5,I think everyone is too absorbed in this Pudding character so when they found that she is what she should be they hate her more than BM herself. I found it kinda ridiculous because SHP was the one who made the call to trust her when they knew nothing about her except the fact that she is a child of BM. Im not saying that Im completely satisfied with the development that Oda gave her but again from the very beginning we only have so much to measure her character and we can only make judgement after Oda gave us new piece about her. Oda is free to do anything he please with Pudding. Even right now the idea of Pudding not actually evil  its hard to call her evil because she is on BMs side and naturally she is opposing the SHP. If we call her evil we have to do so with all others opposing SHP but oh well Ill just go with the flow   can still work because of the power that Oda give her. If her power to crop out and replace memory can work on herself then we wont know what is Puddings true intentions or goals not until Oda tell us later.,OnePiece,dgakjew,3,t5_2rfz5

Hes attracted to her but he doesnt lust for her.

That wasnt cool of me.However in Puddings case I still find it uncovincingly written. If she was to be traumatised character then it could be done in so many better ways. This scene seemed very shallow for me as I have no experiences like that. I believe that when a writer starts writing traumatised characters he has to take it seriously and no easy solution is allowed. Those are two different things to experience trauma and to write about trauma in a way that is convincing also for people who has no idea about such trauma. And this scene was so simple it has no build up and was very conveniently placed. If Oda was to do this again I wish he took more time and details to ilustrate this side of Pudding so it didnt seemed shallow for people who has no idea about it.,OnePiece,dgc2j8i,1,t5_2rfz5

11616035,0,t3_65p07u,I do think that Oda made Doffy too strong. It took Luffy a lot to beat him even though he is just a Shichibukai who is terrified to death of a Yonko. Now i dont see how Luffy who struggled with Doffy can beat the Yonko that he was so scared about or the Admirals for that matter who are stronger than Doffy too. If he had been defeated by the Leo Bazooka and we never got to the point where Luffy ran out of Haki then Luffy might seem strong enough to beat tougher opponents since his G still had a lot to show but now it seems like the Yonkou are unreachable at the current level.Im not so much worried about the power creep for the Yonko since those guys are supposed to be the strongest characters known so far what worries me is every other character like Doffy. This includes the Strawhats themselves who if they are expected to defeat the Yonko and their commanders this ones also seems too strong are going to have a huge power creep. I think such a huge power creep might really threaten what up until that point had been a well written power hierarchy that Luffy amp co. slowly climbed as time passed.Unless there is another time skip or some kind of training arc i dont see the Straw Hat crew beating future enemies in a way that makes sense. Right now we are constantly being introduced to characters that are stronger than anything we had seen before not counting Marineford and yet the crew doesnt seem that much stronger.,OnePiece,dgcors9,3,t5_2rfz5

11638875,0,t3_662ynm,There are some secrets from the Void Century that the government doesnt want the world to know. The government could have created a censored propaganda version of the story play up the Ancient Kingdom as being evil and their victory over it being great but for some reason they thought it would be safer to completely erase it from history.I have two possible reasons why that might be the case. First that the name of this kingdom has some inherent meaning that is dangerous for the government hence why Clover was shot before he could reveal it. Second that the secret is so damning that letting people even know part of the story is too risky. If people know about this ancient kingdom then theyll be curious about it and they might dig deeper.

I actually understand why people are so upset about this because I felt pretty much exactly the same when she turned out to be evil. It seemed totally out of the blue and arbitrary to me and while there were a lot of people saying how great it was and how there was totally evidence leading up to it I wasnt really buying it.That being said I held my tongue because you never know where the plots going to go until it gets there. People were convinced that shit was going to go south with the minks once the samurai showed up it was considered a given on the sub and then Raizodono is safe happened. The point being it might seem obvious where thigns are gonna go but thats not always the way they go.Personally Im feeling optimistic right now. This version of Pudding is way more interesting of a character to me than either her goody twoshoes iteration or the Im pure evil with no interesting qualities version.

He is definitely up there but there is definitely a case to be made for other supernova mostly the two that I mentioned. X drake seems to be Kaidos th in command King Queen Jack  Urouge beat Big Moms th commander and Luffy was a close match in G but couldnt beat Cracker. So it seems theyre all around the same level in addition to Law. We also know that Kid values Hawkins and Apoos strength enough to team up with them so theyre no push overs either. I cant see Bonney or Bege being that physically strong themselves though just dont look like all that to me.gtRegardless of his powers people tend to mock at him because hes a cocky guy that tried to defeat the Yonko and he couldnt. I dont get why some people says that hes a weakling for that.The funny thing is Luffy is just as arrogant if not even more. Kid has  supernovas instead of although Sanji kinda counts as one in terms of strength so theoretically they probably stood more of a chance. Its also possible that Kid is the only one that fought against Kaido. Hawkins probably ran when he saw  chance of winning and Apoo probably bowed down when the moment he felt Kaidos immense power.,OnePiece,dgn4qru,5,t5_2rfz5

11714081,0,t3_672jkw,Preliminary stuff that doesnt really mattergt If Shanks was sailing with Roger at the age of  he must have been a pretty exceptional pirate ... especially being under the counsel of Roger and Rayleigh.I mean Buggy same age as Shanks was also sailing with them at around the same time and hes far from exceptional so I cant really support that conclusion. We dont know how Shanks came to be on the Roger ship. I dont think we can just assume that its because he was strong or anything like that.Plus what do you mean by the word pirate here? It has different meanings to different people in One Piece so your sentence is kind of unclear. What qualities make someone an exceptional pirate?Main Objectionsgt If we remember Shanks told Whitebeard that he didnt receive this scar from Mihawk it means Shanks fought with Blackbeard around the time his duels with Mihawk were widely known about.I dont think that statement is enough evidence to support that conclusion. Shanks could just be clarifying that his scar is not from Mihawk for one of several possible reasonsi the claw marks look like they could have been made by a sword leading people to assume Mihawk did it ii people know about his legendary bouts with Mihawk so they might just assume anyway that the scar was from one of those fights and henceiii he could be clarifying just for emphasis iv another plausible reason I havent thought of yet. gt Based on that information in my opinion Shanks probably fought Blackbeard Teach before heading to windmill village and probably at the age in which he was already highly experienced which would place him at ages of .Based on the above and just in general I dont think theres enough evidence to support this.gt Shanks makes sure to emphasise that it wasnt Mihawk who scarred him the one who gave him this facial scar was none other than Teach himself and it wasnt a careless mistake on his part but testament to Teachs strength alone this heavily implies that Teach himself of similar calibre to MihawkNot necessarily. This could be testament to BBs cunning planning and intelligence. This is obviously a different situation as different factors were at play but bear with me for a second BB managed to kill Whitebeard not because he was stronger but because he was able to use the current situation to his advantage.I think the message here in to not underestimate him. Shanks may have been very careful but this doesnt mean that BB was unable to outwit him. This doesnt automatically mean that BB rivals ShanksMihawk in power. Thats not the only alternative conclusion.gt Not only does Shanks point out that Teach was able to scar him he also insists that the Great Whitebeard should not go after Teach denoting how much of a threat he considers Teach to be despite the fact hes speaking to the Worlds Strongest Pirate.Again I dont think we can conclude that Shanks is warning Whitebeard solely of BBs power. It is a possibility of course but we shouldnt neglect to consider that Shanks is warning WB because he knows how sneaky and manipulative BB is i.e. dont underestimate his cunning. I think the latter conclusion is more likely.gt It means Teach is as strong as Shanks which is why he pleaded with Whitebeard to have Ace pull out of his hunt for Blackbeard.I disagree based on the above. I dont deny that BB is powerful I just dont think he is as strong as youre making him out to be.,OnePiece,dgntjii,6,t5_2rfz5

Wielding a sword doesnt automatically make you a swordsman. Fujitora is a good swordsman but the fact that he uses his gravity powers as well means that he is not a pure swordsman. Same with Law. Shanks is not clearly a swordsman yes in the past but not anymore. Hes a one armed man fighting with his weak arm which is a HUGE disadvantage. Looking at the powers of the other Yonko its not a stretch to suggest that he probably has another power. Its clear to see that Shanks is stronger than Mihawk as well. ,OnePiece,dgowwjx,0,t5_2rfz5

11748203,0,t1_dgrnzff,gt Nope. Being sneaky doesnt and isnt what makes one an Emperor it is strength.That is postDF BB. He became a Yonko AFTER gaining the Yami AND Gura. Im talking about preDF BB. And like I keep saying IM NOT SAYING THAT BB IS NOT STRONG. Im saying that he probably wasnt as strong as Shanks preDF. Jeez. How many times do I have to say that.gt You in fact took Blackbeards its not time to face each other out of context...No I was talking about when Shanks said that. Not Blackbeard. And Shanks was saying that its not time for ACE to face BB. Nothing to do with WB or Marines. The rest of your paragraph is irrelevant.gt Being unpredictable is irrelevant. That is what fights are supposed to be. You dont exactly reveal  what you are going to do so that point is redundant.Untrue. Fights are not generally about unpredictability per se. Its about using your skill strength and smarts to best your opponent. Also we are not talking just about fights. We are talking in general. No one could have predicted BBs true intentions. His ability to plan be patient and manipulate situations to his advantage being unpredictable too is definitely not irrelevant.gt Shanks own statements that places Blackboards as an equal. He did not state that BB is an equal. This is conjecture on your part.gt Did you see Blackbeard also taunt Shanks regarding his scar? that is what bullies do. Clearly  Blackbeard is up there.No thats you making an assumption based on a leap of logic. This is not the only logical conclusion.Firstly being a bully does not mean you are stronger than  as strong as your victim. A lot of bullies do what they do because they are overcompensating for an insecurity or weakness.Secondly bullying is also not always physical. And this taunting is an example of that.But tbh this whole bullying point is irrelevant. The fact is that BB was crowing over the fact that he was able to get one over on Shanks. AGAIN this does not concretely imply anything about their relative strength. Like i said before there are a number of equally valid reasons that he could have been able to scar him.gt If you even have a clue regarding what aching scars denote in One Piece it implies defeat trauma or defeat.No need to be rude dude. But again this is just conjecture. We dont know this for sure. You cant take something thats a conjecture on your part and use it as a fact to support your theory. In my personal opinion aching scars is just a figure of speech and I think youre reading too much into it. But thats a different matter.,OnePiece,dgros7g,1,t5_2rfz5

11751208,0,t1_dgrzmpl,...Are you... are you actually trolling?Like if Robin did anything evil that was because she was forced to but she has never really done anything too bad. Franky was just attacking pirates in general with the specific purpose of keeping the town safe which is actually a pretty decent Modus Operandi all things considered.Caesar poisoned children. Poisoned. Children. With instantaddictiondrugs. On a research he knew was a dead end. On Children. Just kidnapping would be bad enough if it wasnt for all the poison and addiction. On children. And then poisoned his own loyal followers for the evulz. After causing out of spite the accident that made all of them crippled enough to consider them a god after he helped them. He accepted money to do research he knew was a dead end because he wanted to. He poisoned children cannot stress this enough because he wanted to. He tried to kill his own subordinates because he wanted to. He specifically stated he only took the money from the Yonkou because he thought he was safe hiding under Doffys shadow. All of that while working on his REAL project which was a weapon of mass destruction he intended to sell to the highest bidder. Stating he did all of that because he was scared indicates you barely read the manga at all or even watched the anime and is an insult to anyone who values actual decency on a human being. And thats not even considering his role with the SMILE production and no he was not being forced to do it his research was pretty much complete which is why he felt so safe as a Doflamingo subordinate in the first place.And this has to be a borderline hilarious value reversal. He did all the bad stuff he did because he wanted to but he has been forced to do a few good things. And by a few good things I mean cure an island of a poison he himself created after making a quip that indicates he was proud of himself for causing that much destruction and only because he was a hostage. Thats it. Spoilers He is now helping take down an Yonkou which is a more neutral act because it is the only way to escape and he is literally a hostage in this entire situation anyway. By no means is he anywhere even remotely close to the first step towards redeeming himself for poisoning. Children. Which is not even all of it.,OnePiece,dgs11vk,4,t5_2rfz5

I only mentioned the real life part in the above comment because it was relating it to the DF naming.
