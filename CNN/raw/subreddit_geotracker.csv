7750353,0,t3_4i74sj,I absolutely love my tracker but you have to love it for what it is. Ill reiterate on the power issue. If you think youd like something with more than  hp save yourself the trouble and go with something else. People do crazy things with these cars and they can be a lot of fun without a lot of go. Or if you still want one and power then by all means pour money into it. Swap in a . chevy vortec or a VW turbo diesel there are kits available. Me personally I have about  in my running and kicking tracker so its more of a street legal go cart than a x SUV.,geotracker,d3n5oss,4,t5_2u29x
