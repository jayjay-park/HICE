10312416,0,t3_5n33sx,Ive noticed something about this When it comes to the Abrams they become chaotic and bugish in movement when grouped together with more than  as a single slot and then told to move to one place together. But when in their own slot singularly their movements are far more in order as they should be. This is clearly still a bug and annoying but try only putting one and no more in a slot see if it moves more normal then. Hopefully the developers will take note of this soon so such a thing doesnt limit how we can play them. ,RogueAssault,dccyvmh,1,t5_39a4k
10485294,0,t3_5q4l4b,Youll need to use an existing KIXEYE.com account or create a new one to submit a ticket from within Rogue Assault. If youre still having trouble I recommend going to KIXEYE.com directly from a standard PC browser. Please also note that we are currently experiencing issues with ticket submission from Android tablets.There is also a KB article that goes over many of the ways to submit a ticket ,RogueAssault,dcwm84j,1,t5_39a4k
11060138,0,t3_5xume3,I was actually looking forward to this update so far I am not seeing a whoe lot of good outweighing the bad.Good.  I like the token from outpost for replay on strongholds.  I can work with that.  I can chooses to burn oil or tokens to do strongholds.Bad.  Hinds are now paper thin and almost worthless.  Reapers got tweeked up way too much.  Speaking of tweeking up way to much Tanks got a huge buff to the point of now I am being attacked by all tank armies instead of all s armies.  Certainly that was not your intention.  The biggest problem is the cost to repair.  Before I didnt mind spending up to . to repair.  Most of the time it was much less than that.  Now its way overpriced.  I just wont do it.  There is no way to fight alliance wars at this point.  When I originally started playing I really like the model pay to play more I could use my oil up and if I had more time I could continue to play on my own dime and I really felt like I was getting value from my gold by using it instead of oil.  Now thats just not the case. Its not worth it to me. You have priced yourselves.  Economics is all about elasticity of demand.  Your demand curve is steeper than you realize. You went the wrong way with repair costs.  Adding in the gold and leaving repair costs the same would have attracted more players overall.   Now as it is your limited player base is going to shrink substantially unless something is done very quickly. Overall you made lots of really big changes to a game that needed little corrections.  Not a good update overall at all.  ,RogueAssault,delnd3v,11,t5_39a4k

11089666,0,t1_deostrq,amorphous is just a vague understatement. Game balance is definitely not something that is zero to a fuckin hundred. Or rather in this case  because players dont like this shit.Game had decent shape to begin with. It just had to work out slowly to get a more proper form. But for some reason just jacked it up full of roids creatine some top secret military enhancements and formed some abomination...,RogueAssault,dep05il,1,t5_39a4k
11094051,0,t1_dephkff,Word on the grapevine is some of the alliances may be taking some action as well in a bid to send a message to developers. And these are top alliances too. Maybe everyone should take a week off and take in the fresh air. Start a new hobby. Knit D,RogueAssault,depi1df,1,t5_39a4k

11167244,0,t1_dexq52j,Not sure what youre implying. If youre implying it costs    gold that still begs the question of          oil per gold.     oil per gold.IIRC when i had very little gold I had  oil deficit and that cost  gold. I could be remembering wrong.,RogueAssault,dexsna0,2,t5_39a4k

11311125,0,t1_dfe2f03,I have watched and have seen maxed out aircraft with maxed out equipment make two or three passes on a base defense depending on how they vector in.  Drones being an exception due to them just sitting there taking fire until they or their target is destroyed.Helicopter that are player controlled can pass in and out of defense rings and wait for antiair to be weakened or obliterated.  Jets making Hi speed passes can sometimes make several passes depending on the vector they take and there is no controlling that.,RogueAssault,dfe3k4u,1,t5_39a4k
11334847,0,t1_dfgku3a,Happened several times last night again.  This time I submitted a trouble ticket.  And no if it doesnt transition to the card payout screen so you can activate the random payout generator then you dont get any cards.  So effort and oil for repair is totally wasted.  Infamy is for jackasses.  CRIT cards and upgrades are what real players are looking for.,RogueAssault,dfgs9wq,1,t5_39a4k
11696743,0,t1_dgkpp18,Idk what you played last time but all those s and rocket buggies added in la muerte are making it VERY different from last time. Remember the second iteration they got removed because they did excessive damage? That was a good call. Why the hell add them back? Now its impossible to beat it in one go,RogueAssault,dglueif,1,t5_39a4k
