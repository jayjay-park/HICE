3950583,0,t3_35pait,You may just be on at a slow time to get only a few people in Flaris. Saint Morning is typically dead besides players training there or those starting guilds. Many people though have their shops set up in the Marketplace which is located right to the left of the Public Office in Flaris.There might be a few private servers that are more populated but I find that the Tanuki server and Clockworks server are the most populated. Of course the game has had a significant decrease in players over the years but it isnt completely dead yet.ulolwutomgbbq said that theres lag bugs no attention and bad updates. Id like to clarify this a bit. On CW there are bugs such as a constant position lag problem that has gone on since december when the server first rolled out. This is due to a high amount of players and the server wasnt optimized by the korean team. Bugs begin to appear but again the korean dev team works slowly on fixes for the game. FlyFF does get monthly events that last for about  to  weeks at a time. One downside is that a majority of the game is mostly run by tickets players submit but no one submits anything because they think someone else will do it.,FlyFF,cr6lmev,0,t5_2rgnh

8755606,0,t3_5004af,Its way easier to make money than you think. If youre around level  go grind Ivillis Red Rotems lv.  mobs until you reach around level . They drop tons of sunstones k each moonstones Mk each and green level  parts ranging frog around  M to perhaps  for cruiser suits. You can also awake them and sell them for much more. The event ending today largely increased BA cards drop rates. Some of them fulgur electric fire volcano can go up to prices of around  B. The v ? quest starting at the Reonan NPC in East flarine is long but will make you gain several million penyas as well as a lot of experience I know the quest keeps going after level  and soullinked awakening scrolls as well as moonstones and sunstones in case you cant afford them. The beginning of the quest is slow but itll follow you for a while. Most weapons are worth much more than they used to but that will make you get a lot of money if you sell them I just dropped a guardian axe on a normal greemong and they sell for more than  M as far as I know Wcoins will make your money skyrocket around M for  Wcoins and around  Wcoins though thats not an option for everyone.  Events help a lot. A recent event made it easy to collect large amounts of Gold Packages that are selling for hundreds of millions.Overall the prices may look insane but its also much easier to make money through trading than it used to and if you dont solo pex youll find that many people will be friendly enough to give you gear or other valuables for free.Feel free to add me ingame Anfasa or Anfasax and I will lend you a hand to get good gear and make easy money. ,FlyFF,d703xf9,3,t5_2rgnh
