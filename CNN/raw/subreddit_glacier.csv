The Gunsight Pass route begins or ends from Lake McDonald and heads up to Sperry ChaletLake Ellen Wilson treks over to Gunsight Pass and then down to Sunrift Gorge or Jackson Glacier Overlook. The other route begins from Logan Pass and heads out to Granite Park and then down to the loop. An alternative to this would be to head down to Many Glacier from Granite Park but this would require a paid shuttle service. This however is far more scenic than the Loop.You can find more information on each of these legs here ,glacier,cp9utez,2,t5_2xh73

They will let you know about the snow conditions and if the Crypt Lake hike is open but in my opinion midJune should be fine. There might be a little snow at the lake but shouldnt have a problem hiking in. Waterton is beautiful though my parents worked at the Prince of Whales Hotel in their early s and actually got married in Waterton too so that place means a lot to me.But back to your original post if you want to avoid large crowds I wouldnt do the Hidden Lake Overlook trail. Even though the Highline trail can get kind of crowded that is always a must for any first time Glaciergoer. The wildflowers and colours are breathtaking and youre almost guaranteed to see mountain goats on the trail too. You can park at The Loop and take a shuttle to the top of the Going to the Sun Road at Logan Pass. From there its about a  mile hike to the Chalet and then  miles downhill to The Loop.I would also check out the Many GlacierSwiftcurrent area. Stop at the Park Cafe in Saint Mary they have the best pie in the world!,glacier,d2ttxbh,1,t5_2xh73
