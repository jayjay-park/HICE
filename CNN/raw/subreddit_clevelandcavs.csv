42500,0,t3_1ukzs2,Arguably a top  pick in this draft gets you a better player than a top  pick last year. In FA we have to overpay and making a trade means we have to give up assets. And I cant overstate how valuable rookie deals are  years of team control at beyond reasonable salaries. So I dont see any other option than shedding Bynum and building through the draft and maybe adding an impact FA guy over the summer if an opportunity presents itself. ,clevelandcavs,cej9pwr,2,t5_2sl2k

That third quarter was inexcusable but of course thats been Mike Browns m.o. since the LeBron days. Always a terrible third. Hawes needs to be shooting better than  but I think hell do fine once he acclimates to the team and gets out of complete tank mode. And I dont care what they are paying Jack. There is no way he deserves to play  minutes in any game. Ever. Yeah I know Waiters is out but give Delly the minutes. That said I like that even right now down  with  seconds left they are fighting. Even in a loss that is a relief and in stark contrast to a few weeks ago.edit Also forgot to say that Kyrie was fucking AWFUL tonight. Didnt realize how bad until I saw the box score. Im glad he at least knew it and made an effort to get to the line which worked out. Thats where not having Dion really hurts. Theres no one to take over if Kyrie is off.

1139247,0,t3_275e8v,Four candidates currently are in the mix for the Cleveland Cavaliers head coaching position including a pair of former NBA head coaches. Here are the names the Cavs are looking at. Assistants Adrian Griffin Chicago Bulls and Tyronn Lue Los Angeles Clippers both interviewed for the job last week while Lionel Hollins and Alvin Gentry are also in the running according to a report Monday by Sam Amico of FOX Sports Ohio. Amico writes that the Cavs came away impressed by Griffins preparation and Lues offensiveminded approach and itll be interested to see where this coaching search goes from here. Part of that could depend on the other openings around the league and whether any of the candidates the Cavs are interested in end up striking a deal elsewhere. Griffin is scheduled for a second interview in Utah this week for the Jazz opening a job Gentry has also been linked to.

Waiters is a very good player and still has plenty of room to grow.  I have no idea whats going to happen with Miller andor Allen but Id expect the Cavs to be using exceptions to sign guys like that.gt So that along with a player injured all year that people are already calling a possible bust and a st rd pick that will probably be in the s doesnt give your team much leverage at all.The Cavs cant trade their own firstround pick because they already traded their  firstround pick to Boston.

By flexible I mean young pieces who can play multiple positions and seem to have a high ceiling with the proper coaching Lets say we do pull the trigger on Love. That means we will do what sign three players to max deals? Yes we will have one hell of a I hate this stupid term big  but at what cost? The Celtics won one championship with their big . That same big  were pretty much reunited in Brooklyn for one season but they have nothing to show for it. The Heat went to four straight and only won two the second one was pretty close to not happening but for one incredibly lucky play. Hell even the once mighty Lakers who had Dwight Howard Gasol and Kobe couldnt get it done I know one of the worst examples of a Laker super team but still on point. The super team experiment in recent NBA history seems to be more of a talking point than a proven formula for winning. San Antonio is a prime example of how to build a franchise.

And he is likely to get a big contract after next season that I cant see the Cavs paying on top of  max salaries.  .It might not be till this summer or even into next year but it looks to me to be inevitable.

Is a team shooting great from  like Golden State tends to do? Put shump in let him do work. The fact that those two can both play starter minutes and neither mind being in the sixth man role allows us to do that its all down to a coaching decision. The fact that we have that sort of depth that we have two dudes who could legit be great sixth men or great starters and our bench includes a guy that is high on the list in rebounds... its a great thing when bench players could be starters on other teams.,clevelandcavs,co1fq5d,1,t5_2sl2k

Good news is you remind me of the  Cavs. Play great as a unit and have a great defensive presence with great rotations. Bad news is you remind me of the  Cavs. Got punched in the mouth in the playoffs and couldnt answer.

3795735,0,t3_33vi4k,Why is it the best situation for Love and the Cavs? Despite the medias best attempts all you see from him is smiles and laughter during these games while messing with his teammates. He gives us SO MUCH versatility on offense that youd be nuts to think wed be better without him. His spacing alone is a gift for two of the best attackers in the league his rebounding is elite his passing is elite if not underutilized and hes starting to get into a rhythm now with more rest in between games allowing his back to recover. His defense is lackluster but has improved A LOT in the last half of the season and it was evident this last game. Love wants to win thats why he wanted to leave Minnesota. Would he give up a chance at a dynasty to go to a rebuilding team just to get more points? He says no but I guess well see. Either way this team is in no way better without him unless you found another stretch  thats cheaper and can play great defense. Thompsons energy off the bench cant be replicated and his offensive rebounds have won us some big games so far. Sure were going to have to overpay most likely and that sucks but I doubt we willingly let him go considering his impact on this team and sharing LeBrons agent doesnt hurt either. Gasol would be nice for any team but giving up a big part of this team would be crazy. KEVIN LOVE IS A BIG PART OF THIS TEAM. I dont see Gasol leaving Memphis anyway but if he does Im curious tI hope he doesnt leave and was telling the truth but if he does then well see what happens. But until then all this constant talk of Kevin Love leaving is getting old when we have a playoff run to enjoy. We just cant KNOW what hes thinking despite the medias best efforts to employ psychic insiders. In no way would this team be better off without him right away unless they had a similar replacement in mind. ,clevelandcavs,cqoy02r,2,t5_2sl2k

This team wasnt supposed to be this good this fast. We had two roster shaking trades mid season a first year NBA coach not to mention a crazy off season that brought Lebron home. As Lebron has said its a process.That all being said I fully expect this team to rally with an us against the world mentality and fight like hell in this playoff run.

3983929,0,t1_cra7eho,ACTUALLY.. Blatt wanted to bench LeBron. It was LeBron that signaled to Blatt that he wanted to stay in. Also in game  Blatt drew a play for LeBron to be the inbounder but LeBron quickly scratched that and said he wanted the ball.As much as people joke that LeBron is the coach he does do a lot of coaching and changes during the game. But that isnt abnormal superstar players have always done this.. May be not to the extent LeBron has but coaches always consider input from their stars. I remember a few seasons ago when Tony Parker was drawing up a play in a timeout instead of Pop. Also dont forget Jason Kidd was basically a player coach in his time with the Knicks. LeBron has a great mind for basketball and his input is tremendous.Blatt is a good coach and is getting better as he experiences more games. He did have a few mistakes in this series but LeBron was there to help him fix it. Thats a great coach to player relationship.With that said I would like Blatt to tell LeBron to get in the post more since Love is out. We saw how effective LeBron was in the post in this series. They had no answer for him and had to bring in a double team which opened up others. Especially now with LeBrons jumpshot being off. We need to move forward with LeBron accepting go play in the post. Hopefully Blatt can convince him to stop playing hero ball at the top of the circle and just bully in the post.,clevelandcavs,craeiyq,4,t5_2sl2k

4012901,0,t1_crdham8,I agree on where he fits and his likely minutes but I like the idea of having him there especially over a guy like Perkins who doesnt do a whole lot especially well. Having Andy gives us tremendous versatility at the two big spots. We can run a small floorstretching lineup with Andy and Love giving plenty of space for LeBron and Kyrie to work while also having two great passers given their position to allow the ball to flow freely. Want to focus on rebounds? Throw out TT and Love. Need to bang down low and get physical? TT and Mozgov. Should we keep getting caught out of position on the PnR like we did in Game  against Chicago we can throw Andy out there as hes proven to be an aboveaverage PnR defender. We effectively have two guys in Andy and TT who are fully capable of playing both the  and the . Not many teams have such a luxury.With Andy back weve effectively got four quite different yet capable bigs. Love is an elite rebounder who provides a great deal of spacing and can both hit the wide open jumper and create his own shot in the post. Mozgov is a big body who can protect the paint and deter shots at the rim. TT is an offensive rebounding machine who never stops moving and a great target for oops. And Andy is a veteran player who knows LeBron as well as anybody. He excels at pick n roll defense is an elite rebounder and also can stretch the floor with that  footer of his.Im really excited to see what kinds of things Blatt amp Co. can come up with next year having four capable bigs who all excel in different areas. I think it could really open up the game for us depending on the situation. Plus Andy is the man and its always great seeing him do his thing out there. I cant wait to have him back.,clevelandcavs,crdp9pa,4,t5_2sl2k

Horford then calmly stated he was going to pray for Delly but that just infuriated the crazed Dellavedova more who then in an almost superhuman display of physical ability jumped upwards AND backwards from a sitting position using his own head as sort of a rocket propelled grenade in the direction of Horfords face. Horfords only protection thank god for razorsharp instincts and catlike reflexes from such a devastating impact was to use his muscular forearm as a makeshift shield. With his master plan thwarted Delly then took his monstrous rage to the Phillips Arena crowd where he continued his assault by picking up innocent children and using them as battleaxes on little old ladies.

4137133,0,t1_crrcqi5,Lebron is for sure great player. Probbaly one of best  all times. But...Concerning this Lebron played for many coaches and won for all of them and he made bad coaches look good narrative.Is it even reality?First two years he played for Paul Silas... They even couldnt get to playoffs and Silas was fired. Then he played  years for Mike Brown. The best success was just one NBA finals same as already reached this year .Then he played in Miami for  Spoelstra for  years and here he at last really won  finals including  championships. But in Miami almost in all playoffs they had fairly healthy big including Wade who is actually more experienced player than Lebron and also had serious impact. Moreover I dont think Spoelstra is bad coach. Hes not great but I would say aboveaverage NBA coach. And speaking about Brown  he is  not that  bad in setting defence and overall in regular season... But he just not good in adjusting between and in games which is essence of playoff coaching... and... know what... Lebron didnt change it at all.,clevelandcavs,crruoh9,1,t5_2sl2k

Lebron has to make his fucking freethrows as well doesnt do you any good to get fouled if you miss freethrows.

DJ had to be taken out of close games late because he cant hit a free throw and lacks any semblance of a post game.

4465156,0,t1_csthq7z,gtI find the Boris point kind of strange to bring up in the first place considering he wasnt a starter last year eitherHe wasnt a starter but he was getting starter minutes  which is starter minutes on the Spurs more than Tiago anyways. Like I said I expect LAs stats to improve but people forget how good the Blazers were last year and his numbers havent changed much since. Not as good as the Spurs but they almost defeated a team with Harden and Howard in  in the playoffs. LMA is an excellent individual player but I have never seen him as a guy that can excel in a motion offense. I am not sure he will fit in as smoothly in the beginning as everyone thinks. I think it will take at least half a season if not more. Lots of those sets are complicated to run. Another thing there is not much precedent here. Spurs have almost always only excelled with homegrown stars guys they either drafted and developed or guys who were shitty in other places and then they got them and started their training all over. So everyone on their team got trained with similar offensive and defensive philosophies. This is their first big FA signing let alone a star that didnt develop in their system. Its really tough to say how already developed stars will fit in Pops system. I am very interested in seeing how all of this plays out. As for defense I dont get the Bev comparison. He isnt even half as good as Tiago in any of the advanced analytics. Tiago is unfortunately wildly underrated. There just arent many good defensive bigs left out there right now.

4472510,0,t1_csucp1x,My ass. Love FORCED a trade because he threatened to leave for nothing the next year. He forced a trade because LeBron called him. This is documented. He wasnt going to come play with Kyrie.JR was about to be traded once we got him. It was never our intention to keep him. That whole trade was for Shump. LeBron convinced the FO to keep JR who saved our ass throughout the season. Also documented.All signs pointed to Love taking the  deal. Every expert out there had him slated for that. It was a foregone conclusion until LeBron talked to him. He in fact gave up over M dollars. Again LeBron didnt have to do it. He decided to recruit the guy because he wanted him around for  years and thinks he can help win a championship. They arent even the best of friends. So much for your LeBron isnt recruiting players theory. Also documented.West would have been great. Cant force a guy though. San Antonio offers a better environment for his playing time according to him. Documented as well.So I just proved you wrong on  accounts.Im done talking to you if you think he is the GM and the owner. Please continue your sheepish attitude and believe everything the media forces upon you. And you are extremely dumb if you think TTs negotiations have stalled our front office.

4983693,0,t1_cumnf43,Yes I know all of these things. And no none of these outweigh the cons of losing him. Lets go through them. LeBron wont pick up his option. He is going to opt out which means it is going to impose a cap hold which would  of his last years salary i.e. higher than the annual raise he is eligible for. Same goes for any of other nonbird free agents if they opt out. For eg LeBrons cap hold comes out to be be .M higher than his player option.  Next the difference between  and M salary next year is that you are assuming we let TT walk. That is a dumb move in a basketballsense as we cannot replace him at least for a another couple of years and with LeBron aging the time to win is now. Realistically the lowest we can sign him for is Myr. As I have talked about here that is a fair value for him in the longterm with a rising cap. And even though I am just some random dude with a keyboard i.e. you dont have to believe anything I say you can sure as hell believe capexpert Nate Duncan So realistically if we want to keep the best basketball team possible we sign TT. And at worst we are paying M tax extra per year. That again is not going to be the difference between us being below luxury tax vs not we will be above the  value if we sign Tristan to even a  bc of the aforementioned larger cap holds for all of our free agents. The difference between the minimid level and the full midlevel gets even more diluted out as the cap rises because they dont increase proportionally with the cap jumps. Realistically that ends up being about M in past years market. I dont think that is going to be the difference in us getting a useful rotation player vs not getting one. That M of extra salary is not worth not having a reliable PFC for the next few years. Second if the front office is shrewd they can resign LBJ to a longterm max deal and still remain below the luxury tax lineCome on you really think the front office is going to try to be shrewd with LeBron? LeBron is going to sign whatever he wants to sign. Unless he suffers some major injury next year at which point we are screwed anyways he is going to sign longterm AFTER the second big cap jump. LeBron is going to be on the books for M in salary in a few years. Mozgov will most likely get a M dollar raise next offseason. We are not going to have cap space even in a couple of years. I have talked about the numbers here before. Yes a lot of those numbers ended up being lower so we wont be as deep in luxury tax but do the math. We will still be above the tax line. Yes I know about the repeater tax. But as I mentioned in my post Only thing it will do is reduce the burden on DGs wallet. It doesnt make us any less flexible than we already will be. DG isnt low on money. Just look at how quickly his own net worth is rising. He can pay TT M extra more like  this year and  after bc of tax a year AND still stay profitable especially considering the fact that he already got JR and Kyrie on discounts  and Love also on one since he wont be doing the  anymore. Thats his prerogative. It isnt a zerosum game. We are certainly better with TT on the roster than without him so if he does get rid of him it will purely be a money saving move. Lastly this is just terrible talent management because you are letting a SOLID young player walk right now with the bleak hope of having some semblance of cap space in a few years when your time is to win now with which you intend to find someone similar to the player you let go already for cheaper? Makes no sense. And all for what? The hope of having a tiny bit of cap space in the upcoming years which likely wont happen either for the reasons I mentioned?

Varejao and Love cant play together which has been proven. They are both revolving doors defensively.gt We still got a trade exception which is cheaper that a long and expensive contract for TT.Let me jump into my TPE cannon and fire off into TPE land where players that fit the TPE grow on TPEes! A player has to be actually available either through trade or waiver and neither will have anyone worthwhile until December at the earliest and thats if we are lucky. gt  Furthermore I dont expect him to hold out much longer than the beginning of December.Me neither but minutes accumulate and Mozgov is probably going to have to play  mpg until TT gets back because he is the only good defensive big on the roster. For a big lumbering  footer those extra minutes could fatigue him over the course of the year causing an injury.

In fact to do so would be anathema to the purpose of collective bargaining.Not once in this discussion have I advocated on behalf of the team or ownership.  I am simply pointing out that Tristan has become his own worst enemy in choosing to holdout.  He and Rich Paul have both had their bluffs called by failing to pick up the QO.  They have painted themselves into a corner and are trying to find a way to save face.There is nothing wrong with a player negotiating for better terms but only if he has the leverage.

5825912,0,t1_cxj92pb,And finally..the Browns dont have to go full retard and only draft on upside is my point..Literally no one thought Barkevious Mingo had a high probability of panning out. Nobody thought Brandon Weeden at  years old was worth a first round pick. A large amount of people thought Manziel would be terrible because he got away with so much crap in college by just throwing the ball up to Mike Evans knowing he would out jump and college defensive back.  Nobody agreed with the idea of taking Trent Richardson in the top ..although on the same token no one could foresee him being terrible kudos to the Browns for getting a first round pick from the colts though.  Justin Gilbert was another purely upside pick..he was a soft big  corner with big upside but he wasnt a lockdown corner in college although he did make a number of spectacular plays.  I think this year they took a step in the right direction by drafting Shelton and Erving. While I cant say Ive watched too much Browns football this year those seemed like two good solid picks for the first round...Im not here to bash the Browns as I would never root against them unless theyre playing the pats. But as an outsider its pretty easy to see that their problems start with the players they draft...they need to change philosophies much like the raiders have the past  years. ,clevelandcavs,cxjawca,-2,t5_2sl2k

6280156,0,t1_cz3hay1,When Love shoots well and we win people think his defense is improved.If Love shoots poorly or we lose and more so if both Loves defense is atrocious and a huge liability and needs to be discussed.Ironically Loves defense has actually been better for the most part during his recent shitty offensive stretch.  Hes still abusable in some situations the Spurs did it although I still think a lot of that was simply good shooting by Duncan and poor team defense by us but still Love didnt shine there but he has most certainly not been that bad on that end lately.,clevelandcavs,cz3hexb,3,t5_2sl2k
6280836,0,t1_cz3iytu,Seriously. I think we match up better with them. GSW are just so fucking accurate with their shooting and even in our best games we have long cold streaks. They are a terrible matchup for us.,clevelandcavs,cz3k77n,4,t5_2sl2k
6280996,0,t3_41mphm,You guys in this thread are really funny and so back and forth.  Lets go over the facts of this game.  The Cavs didnt care about this game. We just had a really successful road trip which is a measure of our team.  The guys clearly did not want to play in this game... and thats fine... its a meaningless game in January.  We kept doing the same thing on defense because there is no need to show anything in case we do meet them in the finals if we get to the finals as well.  You guys let the media hype of things get to you.  This isnt football not every game matters.  Ive watched enough NBA games and seasons to know this is how it works.  I would have preferred to sit James Love and Irving this game just because but Blatt is really against it.  That being said how to JR Smith get a flagrant  for running through a screen?  The refs have really started to be bad as of late and its killing the NBA product.  If you cant ref a blowout how can you ref a meaningful game?,clevelandcavs,cz3kus9,-3,t5_2sl2k
6283935,0,t3_41orns,I agree. You get Markieff and then you get Blatt to stick to a rotation and offensive system. Our defense is  times better than it was last night. Just poor effort all round. ,clevelandcavs,cz3wv2b,1,t5_2sl2k

6287820,0,t1_cz3j7vs,you should. Love is going to be useless in the playoffs unless A. he learns how to play defenseB.

Worst performance probably still goes to Portland. Also we are playing way below our potential defensively. Way way too many easy open threes and free points in the paint. We also seem to have a problem with letting teams hang around when we are outplaying them.

6751365,0,t1_d0hmpce,I appreciate the compliment.Kyries game this year is just...strange. Hes posting careerbest numbers from midrange for example but for some reason his threepoint shot seems to be completely gone. I just dont get it. On another point  I think people tend to get a little hungup on Kyries not LeBrons  thats a different issue insistence on isolation plays as a whole  as hes one of the best iso players in the league  but with his lack of efficiency this season if we cant rely on him to consistently get buckets that way he has to start moving the ball more to compensate. As long as hes playing like he did last year the isolation is not the issue but that is not the case at the moment.Im not quite sure what the solution is either. I think the best course of action would probably be to continue to start him and allow him to attempt to get in a groove with LeBron and Love but maybe to continue to give him significant chunks of time with the second unit so that he plays against lesser competition and maybe he can rediscover his game that way. This would allow Delly to get more time with the starters to ensure a more fluid and efficient offense and likely more scoring but wouldnt run the risk of killing Kyries spirit or damaging team chemistry all while giving Kyrie a little more freedom to try and get back what hes seemingly lost. Well see what happens.I am by no means willing to write off this season or say we wont see a more cohesive and effective team in the playoffs but Kyrie has to figure it out while showing a greater degree of defensive intensity in the meantime.,clevelandcavs,d0hncn5,6,t5_2sl2k

I think its just comes down to an unexpected rise of an amazing team. No Im not saying we should throw in the towel but in hindsight its hard to argue anyone can beat the warriors the way they are playing. To end I dont think a huge move needs to be made but if there is something we can do we need to explore those options.

You think youve got a nice point lead to be confident about for awhile but then you blink and its a point lead and then you blink again and youre down . At times later in the game it felt like the Celtics were playing the carnival game where the hoop is too small for the ball to go through somehow they shot .And honestly Ive come to respect the Cavs as a result of living in OH for a couple years and having a bunch of friends who are Cavs fans but when its game time you guys are bastards and I hate you and I become shamelessly salty and say things I dont mean. Plus the fact that point lead the Celtics had meant nothing by halfway through the second quarter made me want to claw my eyes out.

Just for added context I also called Carlos Santana taking over in the leadoff spot in rwahoostipi and also called the rift between Kyrie and Lebron before Steven A Smith reported it later that week in this very forum. Its led some to call me the Nostradamus of Cleveland sports. So its a good sign that this call I also made will come true.Even an untrained eye could see Lebron Wade and Melos constant reference to this brotherhood on TwitterInstagram. Any way you slice it if WarriorsSpurs win this year and then look to add Durant theres no way the boys dont have something cooked up. Only question is is it here or Miami. Rileys level of expertise leads me to believe it would be there with a Dragic deal to get Paul.EDIT In answer to your question why in the bloody hell would you not watch?

7293943,0,t1_d270a58,gt They ran it almost never during the regular season. possessions. for reference GSW Death lineup played  possessions this seasongtThey played Mozgov and not Frye in that same game dumb.They had Irving and James off the court at the same time in that same game dumb.Its possible to make one dumb decision and another smart one simultaneously. I mean he did some dumb things today and other smart ones. I dont think they are mutually exclusive and not giving him credit for the smart ones and saying he lucked into it seems totally unfair. Youd be criticizing him if he hadnt made those. I honestly dont remember anyone here being this critical of Blatt. He almost lost us a playoff series with a stupid timeout call and people here still kept defending him. He also started Mike Miller instead of Tristan Thompson in a playoff game which we lost by the way. Our offense also never ran this well under Blatt and this is with Lue getting unable to shoot Irving for most of the season. You can nitpick things with basically any coach. I highly recommend that people at least collect data points till the end of the playoffs and then evaluate him instead of just looking at him in a negative light with every single decision. Its just confirmation bias at some point. I concede that Lue might not be headcoaching worthy but you need more data man. He picked up the job on the go and hasnt even had a training camp yet. Does anyone remember how terrible Blatts rotations were when he started at the beginning of last season and how he played LeBron  mins in the FOURTH game of the regular season sourcegtTo me it seems unlikely they were withholding this lineup but instead lucked into it because of ineptitudeThis makes no sense to me. Love   got . minutes. Our starting lineup got . minutes. Love at the  was literally the second most used lineup. You dont luck into that. It was clearly a strategy especially given how intent they were on reducing the effectiveness of Drummond. You can blame him for not using it more in the regular season but acting like he just lucked into a lineup that played the second highest minutes in GAME  seems delusional. Its not like this is game  and Cavs are down  and are trying to make some hailmary adjustments. ,clevelandcavs,d279t0q,1,t5_2sl2k

7815620,0,t3_4md8go,I put this on another post but probably better to condense it here Defense I hope a solid indepth film study can help the Cavs realize how seamlessly the Warriors would create confusion with constant switching backdoor cuts and high PnRs. There seemed to be a lot of miscommunication that led to a lone open man cutting for the basket. Help defense there were a couple plays where a Warriors guard would burn past a tall defender when there was a defensive switch and no help would come to clog the paint. That has to change. There has to be better rotations on the inside with more communication. Perhaps I am wrong and you can disagree but I think Lebron needs to play more. When Lue took him out when the score was  in the rd quarter the Warriors went on a  run. I think Lebron is key to our defense. Curry and Thompson were off and I dont think its only because they both had off nights. Kyrie should continue to stick like a leech and double teams will help them get shut down. Id rather have an inconsistent shooter like Barnes wide open than the sharp shooters. I dont think Livingston and Barbosa can combine for  again. I would like to note that we did well in our individual onball defense especially liked the effort from Kyrie and Love and that we did pretty decent at rebounding and not fouling them too much. We kept their FTs to a minimum.Offense I really think a lot of it is mental. I think Lebron is an incredibly toughminded player and is able to produce efficiently under pressure. However not so with the younger teammates. Kyrie himself admitted that he was frazzled by the Raptors home environment in G and  of the ECF. Im sure the same sentiments and antsy feelings are here at GSW. Maybe shooting more at the arena? Im sure a quick lead start will also help boost confidence. We cant relegate to ISO ball. We had fantastic ball movement when Lebron or Kyrie would drive and dish it out to the open man. Lebron was finishing extremely well near the rim in the beginning. Lue did mention that we missed  shots in the paint. We had sloppy layups and putbacks and also credit to Warriors for putting up good D. Keep Lebron posting up. We were  at the FT line and I would love to see that trend continuing. He was  from  and I think as of late his  pts have been decent. If he is wide open he should launch it. JR Love and Frye need to shoot more. JR only had  shots in  min. Lue needs to make better adjustments and better nonadjustments. If the squad is doing great then keep that  in.What do you all think? A genuine question what can the Cavs do to not get lost on defense? Is switching on man better than hedging or fighting through screens? Are our rotations not quick enough?,clevelandcavs,d3ujga8,8,t5_2sl2k

7823877,0,t1_d3vedjq,But starting over whom? Tristan or Love? Because Love gave them  and  and spaces the floor. The whole space and pace thing coach Lue is trying to do with this Cavs team doesnt work if you go put Timofey in with Tristan and go big. The Warriors already know the key to unlock that lineup and it is inserting Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup and going small.If anyone should see more playing time off the bench it should be Channing Frye. That guy was stepping up and contesting shots on the PampR and is a guy who can help space out your floor with the way he has been shooting the  this post season. Obviously JR needs to take more shots and Kyrie needs to try and get the ball moving before taking quick shots especially when he is sharing the floor with LeBron.,clevelandcavs,d3vgy7q,4,t5_2sl2k

7935742,0,t1_d47xtrk,I guess what I meant was that he cant seem to satisfy everyone especially if they lose. However even when they win more so in close games there are still people saying what he needs to do different. i.e. Pass moreShoot more. Youre right that he does get a lot of credit when they win but the majority of the time he also deserves a lot of the credit.  This is contradicting but I know what you mean.  gt Its only hero ball if you dont make your shots. Lebron and Kyrie played hero ball in game  but they went in so naturally they got a lot of credit.    I agree. In a sense there is both good and bad hero ball but thats where it comes back to bite him. I think we can agree that if any NBA player has the hot hand they should be granted a pass for hero ball. If youre making all of your shots by all means keep shooting. But if theyre not going in when is it time to stop taking shots and start passing more? Or should you just keep trying to score? Im talking about Lebron here but the question is really for all NBA superstars. If you lose is it better to have  assists or  points on  shots?  If Lebrons shots arent falling he typically starts to pass the ball more. However I personally feel that when his teammates shots arent falling and the pass is coming from Lebron he gets blamed for being too passive even though hes clearly off. Im not looking for the correct answer just stating that it seems that way to me.  Im not blaming the refs for Lebron missing shots. Hes missed multiple shots in this series that typically go in but I dont think hes missed THAT many. Ill agree with you the Warriors have defended him better than other teams and Ill give them credit for it but there have been a lot of play on noncalls and I think those stats are proof to that. I was simply stating that  gt Im sure it gets really old frustrating tiring and just flat out hard to consistently drive to the basket and not get any calls.    But maybe what I should have said is  gt Im sure it gets really old frustrating tiring and just flat out hard to consistently drive to the basket against this defense and not get consistant calls when youre fouled.    My point was it would seem discouraging to feel as though youre being fouled and not getting the call and also tiring if youre being well defended. I feel like it would be easy to convince yourself that passing is a better option...but not too passive.,clevelandcavs,d481w6m,1,t5_2sl2k

I never got an attitude from the Indians that they  knew they would win. I got that with the Warriors. Mostly Draymond but Cavs coming back is so much more satisfying due to how their opponent treated the whole deal.

Where would Steph be if he wasnt born in an NBA household? Everyone needs an opportunity whether its a product of who they meet in life or where they are born. Its your job to make the most of it. Mav and Rich did. This should be lauded. They have a full blown agency and they are getting clients like Ben Simmons John Wall etc.And people are not going out of their way to defend these guys at all. You know its totally possible that they see the nuance and agree with LBJ. Go listen to the podcast with Rachel Nichols and Elhassan. They go over this in detail. Amin doesnt care about staying on anyones good side. He talks about how growing up black in an underprivileged environment is pretty damn different from most peoples experiences and certain words carry heavy connotations. There is a reason every single player and even SVGSpo were on LeBrons side. They are people with a nuanced perspective on this topic. I wish for once instead of questioning and arguing about why someone is offended people did some introspection and said huh I didnt know that could be taken that way but now that you explain it I understand and Ill be careful going forward.,clevelandcavs,db03j4s,3,t5_2sl2k

Hes made the rd most threes in the league and out of everyone in the top  of threes made hes the only one that is also in the top  of percentage. He is shooting  from three on a great volume. Hes also obviously a better defender than Kyrie so I dont need to argue that.Before the tough game Lowry had last night he had a  game on  shooting. That was in January not December. Hes been the best point guard in the East this year and the reason why no one on rnba says Lowry gt Kyrie isnt because they have some kind of hatred against the Cavs it isnt because they are underrating Kyrie its because they understand how good Lowry is.Lowry is th in RPM Kyrie isnt in the top . Lowry is th in Win Shares Kyrie isnt in the top . Win Shares per  Minutes? Lowry is th Kyrie isnt anywhere near.Hell lets look at Offensive Box PlusMinus since the biggest argument for Kyrie being better than Lowry is his offense.Lowry is th Irving is th.VORP? Lowry is th Kyrie isnt in the top .Offensive Rating? Lowry is th. Kyrie? Nope.Offensive Win Shares? Lowry is rd in the league Kyrie is th.PER? Lowry is th Kyrie isnt even close to him.TS? Lowry is th Kyrie isnt in the top  once again.Assists Per Game? Lowry.There is literally no argument for Kyrie over Lowry this year. NO ARGUMENT. The only way you can argue it is if you include playoffs and if you assume that Kyrie is gonna be better in the playoffs. You know what? Ill give you that. Ill take Kyrie in the playoffs because hes a phenomenal player and hes gonna be one of the best players in the league because hes only .Right now though? Its Kyle Lowry.,clevelandcavs,dc01ijs,2,t5_2sl2k

He also seems way more confident and is fitting in so well within our system All his shooting percentages have gone up this season Our road to the finals is way easier than GS who will have to play the likes of the Spurs Rockets Clippers etc.  We have fucking LeBronThere is so much more going well but this god damn sub is an echo chamber of frustration and is completely negative.

11319263,0,t3_61jg0k,I took it as the Cavs just arent really making any adjustments on the fly or mid game yet as to not show exactly how they will fix the pockets the wizards and others are exposing and to also let those teams get used to only going and using those same pockets to score so when they actually adjust other teams will be a step behind!,clevelandcavs,dff0psl,2,t5_2sl2k
11324748,0,t1_dff2jm9,I dont believe this narrative that we can get our score on anyone. Weve seen time and again the team go cold against really good defensive teams. Im not positive Cleveland can stay hot in a  game series against the newlook Raptors. Even with Washington playing stellar ball Im still more confident than not we would win that series. Celtics are also in that yeah well probably do it in  or  section. Even if it were  games Im pretty damn confident we win the series.But I dont think the Raptors are the team they were last year in the ECF. They now have multiple players who can stifle Cleveland as opposed to one or two and once Lowry is back they will not be reliant on two players anymore like they were back then. It cant be under exaggerated how well and how quickly PJ Tucker and Ibaka have fit into that team.,clevelandcavs,dffn3pk,4,t5_2sl2k

11750067,0,t1_dgriisj,Kyrie makes incredibly tough shots like the one he made over Curry All.  The.  Time.  Usually theyre not in the waning minutes of game  of the finals but its not like thats anywhere close to the first time Kyries hit a ridiculously tough contested jumper in someones face.  Hes also missed a lot of those same shots too but thankfully he didnt miss that one.  Im absolutely floored he made the shot and it was wonderful but Im not sure Kyrie taking and making a shot that he often takes and frequently makes is definitive proof of a clutch gene or anything.  Ky certainly doesnt fade away from the big time but not many high usage offensive players do.  Most keep taking the shots theyve always taken and Irving is no exception for better or for worse.As for your last point Id be absolutely adamant that if people judged LeBron too harshly on a  game sample that they were being idiots too.  Just because a large chunk of people would be idiots about LeBron doesnt mean everyone should be an idiot about Steph as well.,clevelandcavs,dgrwe6a,3,t5_2sl2k

11791369,0,t3_688huo,I can see it going  as well. We will have our hands full with LowryDerozan constantly putting pressure on our defense. The defense is still a major cause for concern as well as the blown double digit leads in the nd half. If the Cavs can continue to improve on defense throughout the course of the series then Id be satisfied. I feel like Bogut really couldve been useful in this series to protect the paint and deal with some of Torontos size. Toronto only made  s a game in the regular season at  compared to the Cavs  at . If the Cavs get rolling from deep like we know they can then this should be a quicker series. If the shots dont fall and the defense isnt any better this will go easily go  games. But we still have the ultimate X factor in LeBron so not a huge cause for concern yet lol,clevelandcavs,dgwlatq,7,t5_2sl2k
