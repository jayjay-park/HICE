7956310,0,t3_4o12pt,I feel like the human part looked dull and boring because of the CGI.The effects worked awesomely on the orcs it was quite bluffing but on the humans it looked fake. I dont know why exactly but I found the CGI on the real actors faces kind of overshadowed the acting and made all the characters quite flat. The armours seemed fake the visual effects especially when they did magic looked unnecessary overkill and overall it just deserved the actors acting. Its especially noticeable with the mages in Dalaran they look just like placeholders they didnt find the good balance between CGI and reality for the humans. Also I think they could have removed a lot of useless Hollywood cliches from the film. Especially the pseudo romance pointless not credible and not even in the lore as far as I remember. Overall I still had fun the orc part was really great Id rate it .   and will expect a little more hopefully from the next movie. ,Warcraft,d4ad4am,1,t5_2qhoj

If you go in not reading books you dont know this Gandalf and Saruman too for that matter is just this old mage dude.Also Sauron is really introduced in the manner of this guy is evilok? much like fel magic in Warcraft. It us how it is dont ask why. I love it how Duncan uses LotR as an example and the interviewers argument is there were maps in the books. Well guess what there are maps in game and books! too.,Warcraft,d4e9qp7,10,t5_2qhoj

9899734,0,t3_5grffr,The current expansions name is Legion not The Return of the Legion or something like that. That implies that everything that the story has to tell about the Burning Legion will be told in the current expansion. The Legions story will end in the end of Legion and never continue.However the peoples of Azeroth defeating the Burning Legion seems improbable. My prediction is that the function of the Pillars of Creation is not to close the portal in the Tomb of Sargeras. Why would it be? The Pillars have had nothing to do with portals before. Instead the function is to open the prisons of the Old Gods and we have been fooled to think otherwise.In the end of Legion the demons use the portal to summon Sargeras. Khadgar attempts to close the portal with the Pillars but nothing happens. Sargeras arrives on Azeroth the heroes await the end of the world and the demons are celebrating their victory. As Sargeras begins his speech of triumph the tentacles of NZoth grab his legs and drag him into the ocean. Before he can react in any way the new avatars of CThun and YoggSaron infest his brain and turn him into their puppet.All others humans orcs elves dwarves demons etc. alike rush through the portal in panic. Some demons like the dreadlords join the Old Gods willingly they perhaps have all the time been only pretending to serve Sargeras. Others like the eredar abandon him and Archimonde and Kiljaeden admit that Velen was right. Illidan becomes the new leader of the remnants of the Legion and after that we have three different alignments.The next expansion takes place in the Twisting Nether and various worlds but it is mainly preparing a return to Azeroth to save the titan soul.,Warcraft,daxyigf,1,t5_2qhoj
