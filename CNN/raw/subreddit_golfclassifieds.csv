10393526,0,t1_dcm5v9n,I feel ya I still play a set of Cobra S Pros. Havent been able to find a set that feels like they do. I know the s are some of the purest ever made. Id hate to offend you with an offer based off of PGA value guide and comps on eBay. Yeah I know right handed vs rare left handed. Just dont think theyre worth that much more. So let me know if youre having trouble getting rid of them for your price and we will talk. ,golfclassifieds,dcm67xw,1,t5_2sl5o
