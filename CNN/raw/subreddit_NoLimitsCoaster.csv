180063,0,t1_ceyxozd,Perfect thank you! Ill try playing around with it myself and see. I wonder if anyone has considered releasing a pack of D objects representing the width and dimensions of all the track types in NL just a rectangle possibly equal to  ingame unit long Metric?. That way you could always be sure your building will fit the track without having to calculate different dimensions. Might take a while but it would really help until there is a track exporter available. Im pretty sure Google Sketchup already has an average adult height preset so thats helpful there. Thanks again for the info. Maybe when I get a better handle on the importingexportingcreating of scenery Ill work it all out myself and release it for everyone else.,NoLimitsCoaster,ceyy118,2,t5_2x2dp
1741822,0,t3_2eedp0,Ive heard it costs a lot of money to raise a coaster.Especially if youre raising it from birth yourself. You see a small coaster can grow into a beautiful thing but well need lots of time and resources.but in reality youll just want to highlight everything like uKingdaToro stated and just drag up down left right diagonal or where ever.,NoLimitsCoaster,cjypwo0,12,t5_2x2dp

2785418,0,t3_2rzcu6,I personally havent touched the builtin FV engine at all. Youll find that many people on NLE are split pretty evenly over the two. Id say maybe  are using FVD an  are handbuilding. Thats really huge considering next to nobody was handbuilding in NL. I think its a real testament to how good the new system is.Im still using FVD since thats what Im comfortable with. Unfortunately its not perfect as the export can sometimes add subtle vibrations on vertical twisting portions. That said I still have yet to see anything that can be as glass smooth and precise as FVD.But handbuilding is king if you really want direct control. As much as expert FVDers dismay youre still along for the ride when you build in it being limited to the tools it provides.,NoLimitsCoaster,cnkox8o,5,t5_2x2dp
