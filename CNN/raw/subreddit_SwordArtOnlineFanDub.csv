1469361,0,t1_cj0g2bz,Hello! At this moment the thing that is slowing us down the most is the japanese voices in the original video. Audio editors are very needed for this project! Dont worry if you cant voice act everyone here is welcome doesnt matter if said person has a role or just keeping tabs on the project! We welcome all! If you have any knowlage on how to edit the voices out we are all ears! Its the thing we need the most right now. As for the video calls I dont see them being needed in the future at most a simple voice call and even those could be joined by just hearing and writting on the chat your opinion. Nobody will pressure you into making a video call so no worries on that part.Thank you for your interest on the project!,SwordArtOnlineFanDub,cj0gkdv,2,t5_32jxw
