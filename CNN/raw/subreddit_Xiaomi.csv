My phones almost  on the charger when Im at home.Edit Some phones dont charge if the batterys already at  and will only continue charging if its below . Not sure if this is the case for the mi.There are many myths regarding whats harmful for the battery I recommend you to read shenyes post about it. Ill link it when I find it Here Relevant part gt Leaving your phone on the charger after it is charged has the potential to reduce battery life although this is less of a problem with newer devices as they often disconnect the charging circuit until the battery drops below .

1825823,0,t1_ck8d5i9,You do not need to rood the device at all which is nice!All you have to do is download the XBMC .apk from there website and upload it to the Xiaomi box using the xiaomi box built in ftp upload function.So if you click the link to go to the MI appstore it should give you a page with  or  icon choices at the bottom. Select the right most one and it will take you to another page which will have the app for the ftp upload. Then you upload whatever .apks you have downloaded for instance youtube xbmc etc..For me I downloaded KK Launcher and uploaded that first so that I could work on the box from an android interface instead of their custom interface because I cannot read Chinese.Also I use the mobile appstore on my xiaomi box because I currently live in China and the Google play playstore is blocked.

There are two popular ROMs used outside of China the official global ROM which is updated biweekly and has Google services as well as Chinese apps and the Xiaomi.eu ROM which is unofficial but comes with Google services only and gets updated weekly just like the official China ROM.Unfortunately as long as the Note  doesnt leave Mainland China no global ROM will be coming so Id recommend the Xiaomi.eu ROM.Heres the latest Xiaomi.eu ROM Instructions for the Note  are in the OP.,Xiaomi,cyj8zm2,5,t5_2t1l3

Same goes for the xiaomi.eu updates it downloads the entire ROM. Flashing the full official ROM would also wipe the TWRP.

8302889,0,t3_4t8m32,Mi performs a lot better than Redmi  in terms of performance multitasking camera amp custom ROM support. Redmi  has almost  times the battery backup than the Mi.    MIUI has improved quite a lot. Xiaomi updates the ROM weekly for developer version amp bi monthly for stable releases. Newer phones like Mic MiS Redmi Note  Redmi S have locked bootloaders. You have to apply for unlocking by writing an application.    I was a AOSP user before Moto G. Switching to MIUI has drastically changed my mindset about Xiaomi amp chinese firmwares. I have the Mi amp Redmi Note  Pro both excel in their respective departments. I have no issues with the hardware or the software. The only con about the RN Pro is the camera it struggles in low light but takes decent snaps in daylight.    Redmi  can manage  days with  hours of SOT with moderate to heavy usage. Redmi Note  can manage . days with  hours SOT with moderate usage. Mi chugs for  day with  hrs SOT. SOT can vary drastically as per your usage pattern.    Multitasking. MIUI is a ram hungry OS. You need atleast GB RAM device for smooth performance amp fluid multitasking. You can change the memory settings from developer options.    Definitely Mi. It lasts me through an entire day with data turned on the whole time. Mi already has amp will have more support from the official amp XDA community.    If you need both i.e. performance amp battery life go for the Redmi Note  Pro. The hardware is futureproof atleast till mid  amp it has awesome custom ROM support at XDA.    TLDR  Performance  RN Pro gt Mi gt Redmi   Camera  Mi gt RN Pro gt Redmi   Battery Life  Redmi  gt Redmi Note   Custom ROM Support  Mi gt RN Pro gt Redmi     Have a look at the wiki on the sidebar it has everything related to Xiaomi MIUI unlocking bootloader custom ROMs etc.,Xiaomi,d5ff36g,5,t5_2t1l3

But paying with your hardware is another thing and such bugs have to be fixed before using the masses as testers.Secondly They promote MIUI like hell and want people to use it. So if MIUI is the risky developer version why do they do this? Again They have some responsibility to fix at least hardware damaging bugs before releasing and promoting a new version.,Xiaomi,d75gjap,2,t5_2t1l3

10476723,0,t1_dcvm6ju,gtThankyou. So if I was to wipe cache davlik system and data then flash the new official build over the unofficial build would it work fine?What youre describing is a clean flash. You wouldnt be flashing it over the unofficial build because the unofficial build would be completely gone after wiping system and data.gtId have to download all apps and stuff again right? But my internal storage Spotify downloaded songs for example would be intact?Exactly. All your apps and settings would be gone but youd still have your photos music personal files etc.The reason some people try to get away with a dirty flash is because they dont want to have to redo all their apps and settings again. If two different roms are similar enough to each other unofficial version of rom to official version CM to Lineage OS for example then sometimes dirty flashing will work. If the phone manages to boot most of your apps and settings will be back exactly like they were before. Minor differences between the two roms can cause minor issues though which is why a clean flash is always considered safer.,Xiaomi,dcvn8km,3,t5_2t1l3

11473058,0,t1_dfwgpke,If youre lucky the shop will install the official global rom which is multi language and comes with Google Play. You need to select language at initial setup like with any phone. Alternatively it may have the China rom which has Chinese and English but some parts untranslated and no Google Play by default. If youre very unlucky the phone will come with a vendor rom which needs to be reflashed to official more about this in the wiki.,Xiaomi,dfwgsg1,1,t5_2t1l3

11485570,0,t3_63x2dh,Hello Fellow Singaporean DMoving from the iPhone  to the Redmi Note  is not an upgrade in all regards... Youll get better battery life from the RMN but youll lose out on gaming performancephoto quality and mobile payments. Everyday performance should be fine the phone does have some stutters here and there and is not completely lag free but in general it should perform great for the next  years or so .I do not expect Singapore to get the RAMStorage GB variant BTW but GB of RAM should be good enough.,Xiaomi,dfxvytm,1,t5_2t1l3

11705797,0,t3_670mkn,Ive changed iPhone screens before and I assume its the same with most displays. The glass and the LCD are glued together. If youre going to just remove and replace the glass then youll have to heat the phone up until the glue is soft. Then seperate the glass without damaging the rest of the phone. Now thats really hard. Youre most likely going to mess it up on your first attempt and end up wasting a lot of time and money.  Just take it to a store or replace the whole screen with touch. Itll be much easier and safer. ,Xiaomi,dgmvjwd,7,t5_2t1l3
