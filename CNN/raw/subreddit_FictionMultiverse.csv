Well insular dwarfism seems like a legit explanation and it even incorporates some realworld science in there so its not too farfetched. Heck maybe they were all penned up before the Great Mushroom Wars aftermath because they were so powerful. Afterward they were allowed to blossom and over the course of a thousand years or so they created their own nation.,FictionMultiverse,cgivaes,2,t5_2ytym
865778,0,t1_ch1bdgm,Lets answer this one at a time. It has fascinating implications. Considering that Equestria is in the same Earth as Ooo and the way that a light breeze in South Africa can supposedly turn into a hurricane that devastates the Caribbean because of how complex weather patterns are its possible that reckless use of these weather powers could be responsible for some of the weirder weather seen in Adventure Time my mind immediately turns to the knife storms. Ya know thats a good question. What is the cutie mark anyway? Ive heard that it gives them power and designates something about them like personality or passion which translates to job or whatever but what is it? Perhaps the first ones to appear came in the form of changing fur color and after that they would be stylized by the ponies using magic of course to better resemble the image they imagine instead of being a vague discolored shape that only reminds them of something.. Celestia is extremely powerful but its likely that shes been slightly deified. Maybe she and her sister dont actually control the sun and the moon but theyve been mythologized to that point. However considering that this is after a supermassive apocalyptic event that removes a huge chunk of the planet as seen in Adventure Time  maybe!. wut  ahem If this refers to how the ponies see what looks to them like an image of Luna on the moons surface keep in mind that Americans see The Man on the Moon and Chinese see an image of a rabbit. Different cultures see different things based on their mythology and ideas.. My image of the moon and Mars and perhaps other celestial bodies is that these planets are full of multiple species of lifeforms and that unlike Earth they do have more than one sentient species thats created civilization. Mars has the different creatures of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series the species that Martian Manhunter is part of and even a socialist utopia I discovered from a  Russian scifi novel. The Moon could conceivably have both Selenites and um Larry.,FictionMultiverse,ch2p04c,1,t5_2ytym

3019900,0,t3_2url2p,Great work! I get the impression that as humanity rapidly expands and becomes more diverse Nyar is weakening as he becomes stretched too thin and focuses on multiple dealings at a time. Going from ruling a nation in the early stages of humanity to stealing individual souls making wagers with other spirits and falling in love with humans.,FictionMultiverse,cob0dd7,2,t5_2ytym
