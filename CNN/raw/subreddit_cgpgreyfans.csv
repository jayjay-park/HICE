666754,0,t3_21r0dw,Disclaimer I acknowledge this is all personal experience.I learned Spanish from second grade to th grade junior year of high school. As I ended that final year with ten years total under my belt I realized at that moment that I was as good at speaking the language as Id ever be and you know what? My grasp was tenuous at best. I could still only speak in fairly rudimentary terms and topics like the subjunctive were still a bit hazy.  years later Ive lost around  of my Spanishspeaking skill and I expect it to degrade further.I took up coding as a hobby around the time I stopped taking foreign language courses. Im a CS major now. Let me tell you I value absolutely nothing from those courses in helping me learn HTML Java and Python. Terms like infinitive or tense have no comparison in web design or objectoriented programming. However certain statements like ifselses for while dowhile continue break and return can all be translated easily into English very quickly. My knowledge of English has helped me understand complicated code far more than any other language. Ive never thought about it before  do other cultures have modified versions of languages that might utilize a para loop?The way I see it schools teach skills that will be transferrable and helpful to society or the world overall. As Grey says a select few can hold on to the skills required to input language translation into a computer program. Were slowly moving towards a universal language  English  anyway. English French and the home countrys language are the languages of the Olympics. My final point despite all the evidence to the contrary I do think foreign languages should be taught in schools but sparingly and very early on. If you struggle with it as I did you can choose not to take it later on. If you love it you can take multiple languages. Perhaps a World Culture  Geography class should be mandatory into middle or high school and it could be integrated with the European History classes many take freshman year. Dont hire any new teachers or create new depts just change around what is mandatory so children can enter their chosen field earlier  or if they dont know what they want which is perfectly okay  at least they can take out the classes they struggle in and hate.WHOA RANT. sorry guys.,cgpgreyfans,cgg24yj,1,t5_30zjk
