5519389,0,t1_cwh3ulf,Thank you! I figure even if I dont actually make a difference if we know what the problems are we are closer to solving them. Good work this is exactly what I wanted to see. Even though Ive never stayed in Guyana for more than two weeks at a time Ive heard and seen the infrastructure problems you are describing here. I have no idea why the government in Guyana seems incompetent and unable to address problems as basic as proper plumbing. Are the systems for electricity and water waste management currently privatized? Obviously the problem with skilled tradesmen is that people are leaving the country without looking back and who can blame them? I dont want to live there either and Im not skilled at all! ,Guyana,cwh5hdl,2,t5_2s3m3
6619710,0,t3_46aq2w,Its pretty awesome that you are considering a teaching job in Guyana the school system would benefit from talented international staff. Guyana is a beautiful country with beautiful people but I feel obligated to share my moms experience from her most recent trip shes originally from Guyana and my family visits often. She was visiting last summer for a funeral and was taken back by the way people talked openly about the higher than usual crime rate. According to people living there theyve noticed more home burglaries and carjackings. Also a new president took office and its my understanding theres been some ethnic clashes which had always been somewhat of an issue. Like I said its a beautiful country but it is developing and has its risks for foreign visitors. I would suggest reading Guyana news sources regularly like  or asking around on a Guyana Facebook group. I hope I was able to offer some useful insight good luck! ,Guyana,d0419s7,2,t5_2s3m3
