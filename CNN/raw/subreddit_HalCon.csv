I checked the website and I didnt see any fees listed for any of the tournaments. I do remember that last year there was a magic tournament that had an entry fee I dont remember what it was but I dont recall it being anything too expensive. The first prize was a black lotus so there you go. ,HalCon,cj2iu4t,1,t5_2t2s5
