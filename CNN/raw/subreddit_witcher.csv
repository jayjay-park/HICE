Like late game half naked bandits being harder to kill than early game well armored knights . Also  in FCR you cant farm exp .

The heavy right attack has a longer animation and I use it when I know that there wont be hits coming in.Also there are mutagens that give you percent chances on hit if you do the light attacks it means you get more hits in so that might make the mutagens proc more.I never used the rebalance mod so I cant comment on that.

3373104,0,t1_cpcqyud,gt Right... Ill say it again  the only reason I enjoy gaming is because it is on a Xbox or Playstation. I wouldnt enjoy gaming if it were only accessible on PC because I dont own a PC... therefore I wouldnt enjoy gaming because its not possible for me to game in the first place. How can I enjoy something I physically cant do?So let me make sure I understand this. You think that if consoles never existed then there would not be any way to game? If consoles never existed there are still computers. You would be surprised how low powered of a machine you need to play games. Just because you have some misguided thinking that PCs are more complicated or complex than consoles does not mean that gaming would not exist if consoles did not.gtThis is why people buy consoles. It is more convenient for the consumer. If consoles didnt exist pc gaming would not magically because more convenientIm going to assume that the because should be become. People buy consoles because they assume it is more convenient and cheaper than gaming on a windows computer which is wrong on all accounts. People assume that consoles are more powerful than computers which is also wrong in most cases. People buy consoles because they are misinformed which sucks for them. EDIT Is this post yours?

3791626,0,t3_33t8ad,Copying my post from another threadI figured out the basics after watching the video a couple times. Each card has a strength number top left corner that adds a value to your score. At the end of the round the player with highest score wins.Each card has a type picture of sword bow or trebuchet that indicates which row it is placed on the board. Special effect cards rain or something in the left of the hand in the video reduce the effectiveness of cards in specific rows Reduce the power of siege weapons to  this round etc.Card draw is not entirely clear and there dont appear to be any manaland cards limiting the number you can play each turn. I would guess that you only play one card a turn and the round ends when one player runs out of cards.From what I can see I wouldnt really compare it to MTG or other similar games. It seems more like an advanced version of the dice from the last game. Both players line up their cards and whoever has the bigger number takes the round.,witcher,cqoh4x6,9,t5_2sebi

3829266,0,t3_347ljk,A lot of people tend not to understand how the alignment system really works. For instance a lawful good character is closer to a chaotic good character than a lawful neutral or especially lawful evil character.First the morality axis is the MOST important even though it comes second in the label. A person being good neutral or evil is going to inform their basic personality. Geralt is absolutely a good person. Moral neutrality in the Witcher world would probably apply to Dryads or something. The lawful and chaotic axis is actually secondary as it describes more or less their preferred method for achieving their ends their morality tells them what those ends will be to begin with. For instance a lawful good character neutral good and chaotic good character would all want the same results. Its just how they go about it that might change.The neutral morality is probably the most interesting in that it is a reverse of this. Since they have no guiding moral principles their lawfulchaotic alignment substitutes for morality. Think of it as ethics rather than morality. A lawful neutral character would be guided by the letter of the law rather than the spirit. Its the bureaucrat for instance. In the case of Geralt he is morally good and holds to neutrality in terms of how he views his place in society. Therefore Geralt is neutral good.,witcher,cqsrodi,3,t5_2sebi

We saw some terrible stuff before in both screens and trailers Elder Blood but the past month has been chock full of gorgeous screenshots straight from CDPR. They more than likely had to downgrade it so everyone could run it. The consoles at all and PC because were big on our  FPS. If someones specs destroy it we can mod it too I think it all works out in the end and the downgrade shouldnt be something to worry about. If anything its only a fraction worse than the old vids like the  min gameplay anyway and will be gorgeous no matter what. If you want more mod it but they hit a baseline where its both as good looking as possible and still runnable for those with weak rigsconsoles. I think its great on CDPRs part and worrying about downgrades is wasted effort unless youre terrible at modding pretty difficult to be bad at modding.

Other than that theres not really any necessary mods.In regards to the difficulty that was just kind of a derp on CDs part. They either decided to not delay the game or werent able to and thats a result of them not taking some extra time to make sure that everything was  balanced.

New people flood in and either dont think to checksearch past answers or the dodgy search tools fail them. Its frustrating but natural. A big stickied QampA would be nice.This is just a sidenote but that link and a lot of the other promotional material Ive read really make this game feel like a sequel to the books more thanas much as a sequel to the other two games in many ways which I really like the sound of. Shame its not as connected to Witcher  as Id like  though a lot of stuff from it is returning theyve said no characters from W not in W will appear in the base game.

Maybe because they wanted to make the game larger or the concept was to advanced for a standard pc.People just need to learn to not get hyped from trailers it always makes them feel let down when the real game comes out because it doesnt look like a super edited e trailer or because it doesnt look like a prerendered cutscene.Its stupid to think its going to be anything like the trailer.,witcher,crg1725,1,t5_2sebi

4048377,0,t1_crhnuw4,Of course Skyrim  and ANY other game with faceless nameless mute protagonist from Fallout to WoW  allows for a better roleplaying of your own character just because hes a blank slate.But overall the world of Skyrim is kinda barren. Youre called the dragonslayer  in the world where dragons are simple spawnable monsters that are easily dispatched. Youre called thane but noone allows you to reshape your borders or even gather your own army. Youre called guildmaster but you make no decisions about the way your guild should be doing its things or even direct the guys to do some guildrelated stuff youre simply given a tribute and access to some armor.So yea Skyrim is better at shaping the fantasy of your own character. But even DAI was better at influencing the world.,witcher,crhqvja,1,t5_2sebi

But lots of companies make worthwhile DLC. Some of it is smaller than their planned expansions but they also arent charging as much for it. Some companies make shit DLC that isnt worth it.But good or bad its still DLC. My point is just theres some good DLC. Theres some bad DLC. Something being DLC doesnt mean its bad something being paid doesnt mean its bad. Lots of people have that attitude though.I dont think it serves anyone to just take all the good DLCs and say well well call them expansions.

4060653,0,t1_crj51hd,I believe I had that at the very start of the game.I was lax on monitoring my usage and TDP at that point as I was on all low settings and still getting the crash it didnt occur to me that it was anything performance related with my hardware. However when I started digging I noticed that the crash and TDP were intrinsically linked.For me my very initial and repeatable crash was talking to ciri in your dream.Every time I have crashed since and monitored my hardware it has been exceeding TDP as the root cause. I feel like I must have been going over  usage on all minimum settings at that starter area too.This is noteworthy because unlike every other TDP related crash which I can make happen on demand if I so wish this one was repeatable much like yours. Now the game just crashes randomly if my TDP ever gets too high. I can instigate this by turning hairworks on max settings and going for a jaunt in the woods.

He then walks into an inn and there she is under a hood in the corner. Walks up to her and gives her the sword with an inscription Zireael. She essentially becomes a nonmutated witcher. Beyond that Geralt and Triss live together in a house Geralt being semiretired still taking the occassional contract and triss being the advisor to a new king. I think this has to be one of the best endings there is in my opinion at least. There are a lot of other spoilers and closure in that ending but I just wanted to answer your question.

It objectively takes longer. This isnt a matter of opinion it takes unnecessary extra effort to use potions effectively in this game as a direct result of the lack of an industry standard hotkeys.gtIf we keep dumb down games like this with convenience short cutsAre you kidding me?Hotkeys are not a new Ubisoft Free Roam XX concept theyve been around for a long time.

4080037,0,t3_3720go,Well after finishing the game i felt like everybody . I feel empty inside even after archiving good ending  . Still i am not satisfied about ending . I am not that type of guy that demands ...and they lived happily after ever  ending. I would be satisfied even if Geralt sacrificed himself or something bad would happend to him or somebody but it would happen in full epic mode for example Game of Thrones Books gt btw i read all Witcher books so i am not a scrub.In MY opinion The Witcher  endings waswere better . Why you ask ? Well simply because you get closure after all your decisions  even through the game you will learn about your decisions and aftermath of that decision and decisions are hard to make and sometimes even you must ask yourself about some controversial moral questions. In The Witcher  there are some hard quicktime events decisions that are questionable for future topics and discussions but ending only  lacks of closure of your decisions that happened through the game  and later in Witcher  you will learn that ALL your decisions were irrelevant Witcher   Witcher   minimum  hours of gameplay btw and only few decisions really matter. So even if i ignore this btw Bioware solved this problem with Dragon age Keep nonsense and in some case laziness of developers  or basically lack of time to finish game properly  i cannot explain why we as players and fans of this fantastic series dont learn about our decisions in the end . We learn some things that we already know or predicted but nothing shocking  nothing about our friends etc.. Through the game i was waiting for best friends  moment in tavern like in W and W books where you could speak about morals  decisions and impact you create on this world but sad truth there is none . Spoilers Half of a game you try to find your old best friend Dandelion and even after you find him there is no interesting conversation to discuss you only save his ass again  kill all criminal underworld of Novigrad to find him and in the end he acts like nothing happened and story continues further. I love how Dragon age  Origins showed us ending gt with ALL our decisions small and big ones and their aftermath. Still i love Witcher series a lot. Maybe our prayers would be answered in upcoming DLCs ?,witcher,crlclty,1,t5_2sebi

DAI was a single player MMO I mean weapon damage was converted to DPS!I even bought the Jaws of Harrkon DLC and when I saw it was just added or subtracted main game content I couldnt be bothered even trying to play it.Frankly Ive given up on Ubisofts in house games after AC EAs going the same way after that DLC.DAI was an improvement on DA but thats wasnt hard to do. I gave it as much effort as AC I see no reason to go back and play it again Ubisoft keep making the same open word games reskinned from Watchdogs to the crew all are take tower open territory games.EA well Ill see whats next but theres plenty of cheaper old games I never played after a few hundred hours of Witcher  I can play them instead.

4100369,0,t1_crnh0gu,Hm interesting perhaps I am being too harsh with her. Maybe she is like Keira and just wants to go back to living comfortably. Though I still dont trust her Philippa even says Geralt would be a fool to do so XD. My memory of the first game is a bit fuzzy it being so long ago. But I feel like she didnt put much effort into aiding with Geralts memory recovery in the first game. Didnt she basically tell him to just reinvent himself? It wasnt until Geralt started recovering his memory more rapidly in the second game that she seems to put forth effort into aiding his memory recovery probably because she could no longer brush the issue aside.I also think I recall her not being very forthcoming about who the sorceress Geralt loved was in the first game. Basically leading him into thinking that it couldve been her. Shes definitely an interesting character though. She seemed a lot more untrustworthydeceptive in the Witcher  compared to the Witcher . Which makes me wonder about her sudden warmth and sweetness in the second game. I have the suspicion that shes basically fooled Geralt into falling for her with her act of sweetness and that we the players are easily pulled in alongside him. Ive only read The Last Wish and Blood of Elves way back when they came out in english so I dont know much about her true colors.

And Im with you on the Bioware romances and Im a huge Bioware fan. One of the reasons my favorite romance in Mass Effect is Liara is because by the rd game youve actually built a history with her but even then compared to Geralt and Yen the Bioware romances just feel so...shallow... I worry Witcher  has ruined me for romances in other video games...On a side note Im really hoping that other devs take notice of the microexpressions that CDPR used to such good effect. There are so many small things that make such a HUGE impact. Like the smirk Yen has on her face when giving Geralt a hard time how Triss blushes when you flirt with her the pained look on the Barons face when he tells Geralt about his past...

4103295,0,t1_crnzwfn,I finished the game a few days ago so its all a bit fuzzy but if I recall its a real thing.  You use your Witcher sense to follow the trail of treats hanging off of the trees that lead you to the Crones.    If I remember right the little girl that Ciri bumped into was sent on the way to the Crones through the Trail of Treats because they were starving and didnt want an extra mouth to feed.  Also people of Velen give gifts to the Crones for blessings and what not.  I believe the tapestry that portrays the Crones in the hut is woven out of childrens hair.,witcher,cro01ab,0,t5_2sebi

4104681,0,t3_37me90,My opinion There should be seperate cooldown for all the signs and rolldodge should not interfere with cooldown. Right now it is downright stupid. I need to roll for an insane amount of time to be able to cast an offensive sign after I cast quen. Aard is another buggy sign. First challenge while casting aard is calculating optimal distance but that is a challenge then after I have an enemy successfully knocked down most often than not the insta kill does not work. Quick access menu needs higher time slowdown because it is hard to select the desired sign with that UI.And which sadist comedian decided it would be funny to bind parrycounter to trigger?

Its either impossible as you dont have the full access to the engine or at least very hard and expensive.So the thing we were given worse models and were stripped off cutting edge technologies is a bad thing period. I sincerely hope CDP brings back some of the cut features and special effects in the possible DX patch such as these ones They have a possible classic in their hands a classic that people will be playing in  or  years time and the game has to look good even then.Plus from what Ive seen theres very little difference between medium and ultra settings so even with current hardware theres still a lot of potential to make the game way prettier.,witcher,crqd6ps,1,t5_2sebi

Oh wait shes not his sister IN REAL LIFE. Just as IM NOT A MONSTER SLAYER NAMED GERALT IN REAL LIFE.  But apparently in your world people are totally unable to separate reality from fiction. I dont need to read a psychology textbook to know that Im not Geralt of Rivia. Sorry to burst your bubble Mr reddit psychology professor but I am actually capable of discerning fact from fiction.

It seems to be happening to some people not necessarily everyone.And yes that is the intention greyed out quests main or side do not give XP. I believe it is  now after doing some questing myself. Likewise mobs that are low level will have their level numbers grey and will not give XP. On that final note youre experiencing a lot more of the game and getting rewarded for it. Although it may not be for you plenty of people drop games after completing main story. For the first time I feel this game is worth all the side quests. I agree though I think you should still get rewarded for completing main quests.

But Women outnumber men in PC RPGS which is this one.. so it sort of fits right?As for trends yeah trends exist because they are popular. Also because things havent evolved. Again I dont think its about taking away what exists. I think Its about adding depth.I think youre wrong about feminism but I honestly dont think I can convince you otherwise. I hope you understand one day that there are things that could get better. Does that mean everything a woman says is correct? No. But to deny what does exist does a disservice to the world.A game with no women? Wouldnt matter if there was more depth. This isnt about what does exist. Its about what doesnt. How do you know something wouldnt be successful if it isnt made? Its not about force feeding anyone anything. Its about maybe just maybe opening up stories to people who dont get their stories told.As I said the Witcher  is probably my favorite game ever. CDPR did amazing things to have strong females. I think its great. This wasnt ever about the witcher. It was an example of a trend through gaming as a whole.Should of they mentioned the good in it? Maybe they should have.

4159164,0,t1_cru7pac,I did the exact same thing. I played all the Witcher games and didnt read any of the books. So my loyalties were more with Triss initially and figured if I ended up liking Yen more I would have the chance to change my mind. Luckily i read just enough about peoples experience with the choices on reddit that I was able to conclude the best course of action was to eat some gameplay time reload my Now or Never save after I completed The Last Wish and go back and say goodbye to Triss. Now that Ive completed the main story line I can safely say I have no regrets. In regards to comments that you could go to skellige way before you do Now or Never  Yes thats true but the flow of the game seemed to suggest you quest in Novigrad before making a giant journey across the ocean to meet with Yen. Plus the lvl recommendation was . I was like lvl  or so when I had to make the decision to go to Novagrad or Skellige. My gut wanted to go meet with Yen first just because that was a story and character I did not know and then I was gonna go meet up with Triss. But the lvl requirement suggested I go to Novigrad.  So then I was committed and bam there I was banging Triss and regretting it. ,witcher,crucsyl,2,t5_2sebi

4164029,0,t1_cruujdr,gt What?One of the decoctions gives you health back when you spend stamina not kiddinggt Not everybody will take or use this completely irrelevant.What a stupid thing to say.  It is obviously relevant because were discussing the difficulty of the game.  Moreover its only the rank  version you can get it early on of the most useful spell in the game Id say pretty much anyone who takes even a cursory glance at the talent tree will take rank  Quengt So name a game you feel contains objectively hard combat and lets see if I cant describe it in a way that makes it sound trivial?Halo  on Legendary was probably the hardest game Ive played for single player Id say that Starcraft is probably the hardest game to really play anywhere near the skillcap good luck making professional Starcraft look trivialgt This is just silly. First of all the size of the buttonkey means nothing and you know that. Secondly you dont become invulnerable while dodgingrolling unless you have taken and slotted a specific trait otherwise you can be hurt andor killed mid dodgeroll. So again this is irrelevant and again overly simplified description of the mechanic.Only bad players will get hit repeatedly by anything if theyre actively rolling away.  You have to be pretty unlucky to get hit while rolling.  Of course as stated if someone is bad at the game they will find this harder but that doesnt make the game hard it makes them a bad playergt I also dont feel the Souls games are hard either for me.I havent played them yet but they look extremely easy.  Like a simplified Witcher  just roll around on the floor all day and youll never die.  I still plan to play them at some point but the idea of rolling around on the floor for  hours is just... ughh...gt My objection was to you claiming there was a circlejerk about the difficulty of this gameShould have seen it a couple weeks ago...gt I still dont believe there is any reasonable way to measure the objective difficulty of a game like this with any acceptable degree of accuracy.Stupid thing to sayThe game literally has difficulty settings which is not at all uncommon  most games have measurable difficulty standards.  Like you wouldnt say that Chess and Checkers are equally difficult one is obviously considerably more difficult and complex than the other,witcher,cruwpxm,-2,t5_2sebi

4177827,0,t1_crwgmw0, I would imagine it would be fairly rare. For one to carry a sword on your back is highly impractical. Sheathing your sword would be very hard and drawing it would be impossible without a very short sword or a short scabbard. Perhaps a scabbard with a split at the end could work so the sword could break away from the scabbard while not needing to be fully drawn out the end of it. Peoples arms are only so long thats why swords are worn at the hip as you get a longer distance to draw from. Even at that long swords might be carried on a horse as they were heavy and still fairly impractical to draw even from the hip.    Furthermore swords were and still are for a real sword expensive. Only the rich would have had a decent sword and most foot soldiers would probably have used something more like an axe. Less metal doesnt need to be sharp it can be used as a common tool and the handle can be replaced easily and cheaply. So two swords wouldnt be common either.,witcher,crwh6ut,1,t5_2sebi

Its definitely one of the best games this year.I will have to say that my heavily modded version of Skyrim dethroned BG II as my all time favorite game long before Witcher  came out and so far W is hitting enough sour notes to keep Skryim on top.As much as I love the graphics and story of Witcher  I have several major issues with the overall gameplay  Movement Scaling Combat Inventory Management and just the general fact that Im spending most of the game feeling vastly overpowered even on DM difficulty.Hopefully the W modding community will be as prolific as the Skyrim community and one day Ill be able to call W my new RPG home.,witcher,crwhdwd,5,t5_2sebi

You wont be as effective at casting signs as with pure griffin build but you can hybrid a swordsign build in heavy armor by focusing on adrenaline gain and using that instead of Stamina. Maribor Forest will be your friend. You can spec full sword if you want for this build as well just bleeding all of your adrenaline into signs with Flood of Anger and Rage Management.Note Superior Petris Philtre guarantees application of critical effects from signs as well.

Signs though are the most OP build you can do if you go all out blasts through Death Marsh very easy just spamming igni.Crossbow What crossbow you have doesnt really matter just pick one that looks good. You will notice its use in Skellige especially when you realize that crossbows are the only way to attack enemies under water and it is a    shot for everything. You can also shoot flying enemies out of the air with it.Trophies Yep trophies feel pretty useless sells for shit too. Wish it was more like Witcher .Crafting If you want to craft the best gear in game look in to the witcher sets you can do it as treasure hunts in game or you can just google the location of the diagrams. There are cat school feline light armor for attack power griffins school medium armor for sign intensity or bear school ursine heavy armor. You can upgrade each piece  times enhanced superior and mastercrafted. Each set also has swords.Traps No clue,witcher,cryph3h,1,t5_2sebi

Unless the enemies jump back which they are prone to doing. If you manage to circle around harder enemies while swing so you hit them in the back then it obviously does more damage but still not much.When fighting a tougher monster especially anything made of rock I find heavy attacks to be the most effective.I typically pop Quen only  pts. in it though.

You should be able to use your Witcher senses  to see a torch to the right of the hidden door if you light it then it should open. But if when you use your senses Geralt doesnt say anything about the scratches and when you light the torch nothing happens you probably have a problem. Id try reloading an earlier save I found that if I didnt get there by the gangs of novigrad quest and went via competing in the arena instead then it worked. Some people found that not reading the note that mentions the door before trying to open it fixed the problem as well. I thought they had tackled this glitch already but maybe not.

4250403,0,t3_39m6yp,I hope CDPR notices this. And by notice I mean taking action and actually fixing the myriad of issues the game has. The Witcher  Wild Hunt greatest achievement is that it is a great game despite so many flaws.Many of them are less of an issue because they require you to have played the previous games so those new to the series are oblivious to many problems that break the immersion for those aware of them which is even more sad because the more invested you were into the universe the more things may fall apart.For example the game is a terrible sequel because it ignores what may have happened in the previous games Dead character come back to life Thaler Rightful heir and Radovids wife is ignored Adda Siegfried of Denesle is ignored and depending on your choices he is your friend and the grand master of the Order In the first game the major romance options are Triss and Shani. Another ignored character which is made even worse if you decide to never romance Triss and yet Yennefer will think you did. And above are only from the first game. The list only grows with the second game whose ending has wildly different possibilities that should change how the war pans out but instead characters like Anais Iorveth and Saskia are ignored Henselt is killed anyway and the witch hunt happens anyway.Everyone who played the second game thought their choices would be respected. It is even insulting to have the feature of importing or simulating saved games. It would be more honest to just say they chose one path as canon.But even then the problems do not end. Radovids character is turned into a one dimensional mad king whom is supposed to be a tactical genius trait that allows him to beat Nilfgaard but somehow Dijkstra can also beat them while seizing the power unopposed and seamlessly. So smart except that for achieving this Dijkstra has to convince Geralt to walk away from Roche and Ves after they risked their lives helping you fight against The Wild Hunt and just saved your ass moments ago also ignoring Geralt and Roche may be bros since the second game and that you could romance Ves.And what happens if you dont want to let them die? Dijkstra a crippled guy who claims to not be good in a fight joins the fray and try to take on the white wolf and his two white stripe commandos pals. Sigh.By the way since Anais and Adda are ignored how exactly Roche and Thaler plan to unite Temeria? do they want to rule it themselves and hope everyone else will just agree? That is assuming Emhyr keeps his word which he was known for but what about Lethos case?Then we have the poor depiction of Eredin more shallow than soap opera and cartoon villains. No more than an evil dude in armor easily beaten by Geralt. More of a joke than a real threat which turns out to be the white frost in the last moment with no real build up and that is conveniently dealt with by Ciri. Somehow.And the list goes on... Ciris fate depends upon seemingly innocuous choices that require you to have similar world views to the developers Triss romance is somewhat lacking third act feels rushed the ending lacks what happened to Geralts friends like Dandelion and Zoltan and etc..And we are not even talking about gameplay issues like the inventory the fall damage yeah I know just roll among others.The priority should not be making more side quests i.e expansions but revamping the game so it can fulfill its potential.,witcher,cs4qgg2,11,t5_2sebi

4258584,0,t3_39pva6,Hes not better than the Crematory Alchemist heres why the alchemist doesnt carry empty bottles he carries diamond dust sapphire dust emerald dust and amethyst dust. It looks like he just has one of each but he actually has an unlimited supply everytime you open the shop inventory with him it refreshes. heres the kicker the price he sells the dust at is actually marginally LOWER than the price you can sell that same dust to the Armorer in Heirarch Square and also I believe at other Armorers of his price level Oxenfurt.  So you actually make MORE than the full price of your trophy e.g  trophy wroth  Crowns I buy Diamond dust from him for  Crowns add some random items to make up the  difference and then sell that dust to the armorer for  or something close. Alchemist also sells Greater Runestones one of the few remaining that sells all varieties of them postpatch so thats a good way of fattening his wallet to sell him things you dont need. Its also better to leave your trophies with him because if you want to buy it back you wont be dealing with the price flip of other merchants where you sell them something for one price but to buy it back they charge you much more than what you just sold it to them for.

Skyrim has a wide range of activities to do but very little story associated with them. I think this aspect was actually covered a little better in Fallout New Vegas and Oblivion for example. To enjoy a sandbox game its true that you have to give up strong story direction to some extent but as Ive said previously the main story of Skyrim was never an issue to me. Additionally the way Witcher  plays is little different to a Skyrimstyle sandbox game other than the fact we already have a strong identified main character rather than the DIY approach. ,witcher,cs86hu1,4,t5_2sebi

4285523,0,t3_3811gk,Well ... they want to go someplace civilised right? Where would they go not to be persecuted? Im guessing they have to know something about the place theyre going to visit to teleport safely. And even then theres a  risk of failure. Perhaps more talanted mages like triss and Yennefer can teleport more safely but most of the mages in Novigrad probably werent that talented. And if they spread it out ... theyd have to dump some of the lesser mages into unknown territory. Theyd lose the safety of numbers. Keira went out into the wilderness. She didnt like it. I take it most other mages would have no idea how to survive in the wilderness so in a way the city might feel better. Since they can hide. So all in all perhaps going by ship is both easier and safer since they can all travel together at the same time and arrive in a manner that wont cause panic.,witcher,cs8p68r,1,t5_2sebi

4290928,0,t1_crxk780,Ran into this problem after I started a new game. Luckily I had a save right on the bridge leading up to it so I tested a few things.I dont know if the problem is triggered by leaving White Orchard because I havent even gotten that far yet. I had just unlocked the map PoIs and had just finished clearing the bandits in that ransacked village and was going through.The problem seems to be caused by one ghoul not spawning properly. Each time I killed the ghouls and the site not having the people show up only  ghouls were present and then it got stuck.So testing out meditating to random points in the day I ended up waiting until midnight and going back to the site and at that point  ghouls were there and killing the  ghouls caused the people to trigger and the site the clear. I dont know whats causing the th ghoul not to trigger but it may be time of day but meditating after you kill the first  doesnt reliably cause the th to miraculously show up.

So you see NG is something to make people able to reach the cap level. Secondly a game with such diverse and impactful choices such as TW has a lot of replay values but you are going to play again as Geralt and its a bit tedious to be at lvl  again once you already finished the story especially those who beat the game on Death March.

Anyway dying in  hits is sort of normal since youre not super OP early on its also the most dull period and the hardest to level in  that is but you shouldnt be getting hit that much either. Most enemies are highly predictable and only require dodge others like golems often require a roll or two or wraiths who attack with numerous hits at once.

The oblivion system was badly optimized as you leveled so did the mob but often times unless you selected the right combat skills they grew harder to fight not easier. Often times that resulted in players wanting to keep overall level down as low as possible.A system that mixes the two surely is possible as DeeJayDelicious pointed out progression is a feeling players like me included but losing difficulty at its cost also sucks.I like mobs with defined levels as they help navigate the player and set pacing. definitely Keep that but also adding scaling with a diminish return could fix both problems. This would mean the feeling of progression is intact but the majority of the creatures remain challenging through a fair proportion of the game  i.e instead of only  or  levels they might remain a threat for  or so.,witcher,csfqtao,2,t5_2sebi

Its talked about a little bit you get to visit a world thats frozen over but how is that different from an ice age?. You get to hear an obscure prophecy. At an unknown point in the future the White Frost may or may not arrive and it may or may note wipe out humanity. To me at least the White Frost felt like a story hook for possible future games.

4435662,0,t1_cspsnnp,I tried to  my first playthrough and I still missed a lot of shit.

Every time I found a new merchant and every time I was about to loot a chest or crate I had this little excitement for finally finding those goddamn recipes.  I didnt find it so I finished the the first time without finding those recipes.Immediately after playing through the game once I started a new game.  I also finally relented and Googled where to find Golden Oriole and Maribor Forest.  I discovered I had missed an herbalist!  I put in almost  hours into the game at that point I had thought I had explored most of the game world but there was an herbalist sitting right there near some major quest areas that I completely missed.Honestly I cannot give CD Projekt Red enough accolades for their world building.

She wouldnt work for gameplay since cdprs version of her has beyond op powers and since she isnt a witcher no potions mutagens or signs. And as for plot what could possibly be left for her to do? What could pose a challenge to her. Nothing any bad situation she finds herself in would be trivialized. If you have to contrive reasons to make her work or otherwise resort to forced writing then she simply is not worth it.Ciri and her future is something that should remain nebulous theres a reason sapkowski had her exit the stage in the books. There are other characters that would be more appropriate for a protagonist but honestly Geralt will always be the best choice.

4455086,0,t1_css45zn,gt The few times he does get into action he rarely uses signs.I have read fewer Witcher stories than you have.  Ive read through The Last Wish Ive just started Sword of Destiny and I plan to read the novels soon.  In The Last Wish which is my main frame of reference outside of the games Geralt uses Signs pretty often.  I think he uses signs at least once in every short story.  While I cannot confirm nor deny that Geralt uses signs infrequently in the later novels based off of The Last Wish alone it looks as though Geralt uses Signs regularly.  That first collection of short stories indicated that he used Signs when facing particularly powerful monsters or humans with magical powers of their own.  When he fought against humans or nonhumans he typically outclassed his opponents so much that he only had to use his base physical abilities to defeat them.Off the top of my head In The Witcher one of the very first things Geralt did is get into a bar fight and kill some thugs.  When the city guard arrived he used Axii to hypnotize them so they wouldnt arrest him. Later in The Witcher Geralt cast the Sign of Aard during his fight against the striga.  Unlike in the video game Aard could be cast as a continual stream of force rather than just a burst.  The way Geralt cast Aard in that fight appears to be similar to how it was depicted in the opening cinematic of the first witcher game. After scaring the striga off Geralt found sarcophogus where she slept.  He hopped inside of the sarcophogus pulled a stone slab over it then traced the Sign of Yrden onto the inside of the slab to hold it in place. In A Grain of Truth Geralt used the signs of Heliotrope and Quen throughout his fight against a bruxa.  Unless Im mistaken Quen is used against physical attacks like when the bruxa dove towards him from the sky.  Heliotrope is used against magical or intangible attacks like when the bruxa used a sonic attack against him.  He had to use both Signs often to stay alive against such a powerful vampire. In A Question of Price Geralt and the druid Mousesack combined their magical powers to knock out a powerful magic user who nearly killed an entire room of people using telekinesis.  Geralt used the Sign of Aard and Mousesack cast a curse I think. In The Last Wish when Geralt and Yennefer first met Yennefer cast something violent at Geralt.  Geralt had to use Heliotrope or else he wouldve been seriously injured.In regards to Quens description I didnt remember it quite right. The description I was thinking of can be found at the end of The Lesser Evil.  The citizens off Blaviken thinking Geralt was a coldblooded murderer tried to stone him.  He used a Sign to protect himself.gt The witcher holding himself straight raised both hands and made a swift gesture with them.  The crowd heaved the stones came flying more thickly but the Sign protecting him behind an invisible oval shield pushed them aside.,witcher,css8vsg,1,t5_2sebi
4455936,0,t3_3c4tfq,First of all thank you seriously. This is amazing. You guys did an excellent job. It may not be absolutely perfect but its damn near it. The only things I can recommend?  Add a history text box to the side to let you know what card the player used to let you keep an accurate account of whats been played incase you missed it. Or if that proves difficult perhaps a border or highlight around the last played card would work just as well. A button that allows the user to queue back up again in case the opponent leaves.  A chat box would be amazing along with the ability to close it out or mute it. A feature to say GGWP would go along way. Ive run into some slight bugs like seeing a Nilfgaard deck user playing a monsters card only unit. Weird but yeah. Also a bug I ran into while using a monster deck is sometimes when using a unit that doubles the strength or playing a horn sometimes a unit would not benefit from its usage not hero cards standard units.Again thank you guys for giving us something to feed our gwent addiction. Its amazing.EDIT One last thing actually crossed my mind recommendation rather. A friends list system isnt ENTIRELY necessary.

Im sure shed make a good leader just not a fulfilled one. ,witcher,csswhpj,24,t5_2sebi

4461001,0,t1_cssxnu9,True there are many great games that arent The Witcher. And while the gameplay and combat in TW are good enough they arent anything amazing. There are other games that are mechanically better. The Souls games have much better combat for instance.    What makes TW as some outlets labelled it the best game ever made is the narrative. The interesting characters the intricate questlines and of course the wide range of emotions it made you feel. FO will not be able to provide that. Sure you can say but you dont know that! and its true I dont. But when they announce the next Call of Duty I can make a reasonable prediction of what that game will be like. Fallout  will be what the fans expect it to be  a bigger Fallout  with a few more features. Its not going to rewrite the rules of what RPGs should be like TW did.    Now Im not saying Bethesda games are bad. I have many hundreds of hours clocked in them. They are fun to mess around in they are fun to mod and try out different play styles. But their stories are always cliche the dialog cheesy and characters one dimensional and uninteresting.  I remember so many instances where those games simply left me disappointed. For example in FO when you finally find your father and hes like Oh hey buddy. Nice to see you. Can you go get that thing from that place? Thanks. I just sat there going Seriously?  The worst I ever encountered was in Oblivion. I was doing the mages guild quest hunting this terrible mage who has been murdering everyone. And then I found him and hes a  elf in rags I punched him twice in the face and that was the end of that. I sat there for a few minutes trying to comprehend how anticlimactic and plain pathetic that was and uninstalled.    So yes are there mechanically better games than TW? Plenty.  Can anything live up to its narrative? To what makes TW what it is and make everyone crave for more of it? Not for a long time. I wouldnt count on anything before Cyberpunk.,witcher,csszm4t,1,t5_2sebi

Would be a perfect opportunity for Iorveth to show up Vizima expansion that focuses on the Nilfgaardian political situation and gives Emhyr some time to actually demonstrate his character Main narrative expansionrework that fills plot holes regarding the white frost gives characters like Eredin and Ciri the development they deserve and overhauls the endall of act . Make Dijkstra not retarded. Brokilon expansion with the Dryads.Seeing characters fleshed outgiven opportunities to shine would be nice as well. I would like to see more of Letho Roche and Vesemir.

In my case it was Im just gonna go kill the monster and come back and beat him in gwent. little do i know he was gone  The other missable Gwent Cards are a bit more obvious mainly limited time tournaments and Lambert are the only ones missable than the stupid White Orchard dude.,witcher,csxtizr,1,t5_2sebi

Either way you wont miss out on any content as far as I can tell.Youll come across several Scoiatael units in the game and get the option of siding with them or with humans so if youre sympathetic to their cause you might choose Iorveths path for the sake of immersion.Iorveth and Saskia might be included in a future expansion but thatd be many months from now.,witcher,ct26b2n,1,t5_2sebi

No I didnt go to every single question mark on the map because I dont need the shit loot that came with them and the glowing stone things were not very important to me playing through the game. What did I do wrong to miss out on  hours in this game. Its my all time favorite game lore and content wise but I feel like I missed so much anyway.

4690378,0,t3_3f6cmu,Eh its a bit iffy especially early on and kinda messed up designwise.For the first  levels you wont have all the oils. That means Poisoned Blades and Protective Oils wont work if you dont have the right oil for the job.Refreshment giving a  heal when you drink any potion is fine but you will only have it for a few levels. And then you will get yourself a Troll decoction andor Ekhidna decoction or one of the others and its no longer needed at all. I always spec out of it after I get Ekhidna its overkill. And again by that time youre using Superior White Raffards too which heals a LOT.Fixative Oils talent is junk. You cant get it until youre  points into Alchemy tree. By then youre using Superior oils which have  charges so Fixative Oils are no longer needed they last long enough for any fight. Not worth the  talent points and a slot. As a talent its completely counterintuitive. You need it the most at lowest levels when your oils have least charges. You need it least when youre high level and your oils have most charges. And the game only lets you have it when youre high level. Makes no sense it should be a tier  talent.The talent that gives your nondamage bombs  damage? Pretty useless too. This is static damage which doesnt scale. It does  damage at lvl  itll still do  when youre lvl  and by then that  damage is a fraction of even trash monsters health. And in NG mode itll be a complete joke. And eve at lvl  its an equivalent of a single fast sword attack. Again not worth the whopping  points or the slot.Talent that increases decoction duration? Makes no sense. They last  mins base. With other talents they last over an hour. More than enough time certainly not worth the points or the slot especially that deep in the tree.Timeslowing Frenzy talent I believe it only works against one enemy whoever youre attacking and only as they counterattack. Which makes it pretty limited. Though its awesome for avoiding those lowtelegraph counters. But its easier to just not get countered in the first place by not attack spamming.Basically a lot of these talents reduce your alcohol consumption by giving you more bombs per alcohest longerlasting potions and decoctions etc but again the irony is that alcohol is scarce early on and expensive and you dont have much money. But by the time you get all these alcoholusagereduction talents you have SOOOOO much alcohol I have over  Dwarven Spirit alone and SOOOOOOOOO much money that you can buy a metric shitton of alcohol any time you want. Which once again makes no sense.And so on and so forth.Ill admit its a pretty fun spec and its what I usually play with but strengthwise Id rate it as dead last behind all others. Especially considering that other specs can easily grab Acquired Toxicity just  points and  slot and use multiple decoctions same as a specialized Alchemy spec this talent really needs to be changed. With bombs you get more bombsperalcohest but they dont do more damage until Cluster Bombs but those spread so far they often miss entirely if youre fighting a single target. ,witcher,ctlrjnz,6,t5_2sebi

4699211,0,t3_3fahzj,Use yrden or quen either one will do the trick as long as you learned to dodge. Yrden if youre feeling like going on the offensive and quen if youre feeling defensive. If they teleported into yrden they will be slow enough to land a hit on before they can attack you but you can always dodge out of the way. The trick to fighting them is to wait for the teleported dodge out of the way wait for them to stop swinging if they are in front of you and then attack them. I havent tried moon dust but specter oil does make a good amount of difference because specters have pretty low health.,witcher,ctmvi2y,1,t5_2sebi

Especially because Im playing a potion focused build since my first playthrough I played sign focused sign focused is kind of OP imo. Honestly the only reason I have problems is because I dodge and Im out of range of the wraiths attack animation but the actual hitbox for the wraiths to do dmg is much larger.

Between TW and TW he starts to remember some stuff aided by the guys at Kaer Morhen Dandelion Zoltan etc. So at this point you could read some of the short stories befofe The Last Wish but thats optional.  Then at a certain point in TW you and Triss will get on a boat and she will finally tell you about some person and some other person who are very important in your life. That would be a good time to read The last wish the story named the last wish in the book named the last wish and The Sword of Destiny.

4734858,0,t1_ctr0ep8,All depends on personal playstyle. First time around I went full Alchemy. It has fun benefits  running multiple decoctions lifestealregentravel potions last a long time potions can proc other potions you generally have a lot of health and then regen on top of it. It had a fun arc and stayed amusing the whole time.Second time I went with Signs. Thats very different depending on how you allocate your points because there are fewer explicitly garbage skills than the other two trees in my opinion!. In general I either hit them with Aard or Igni I had already had my fill of Quen during my first playthrough blasphemy I know and it was pretty satisfying. I also went for Axii for the dialogue choices.For points for Alchemy Id just say out of the bomb tree as its not as useful in my opinion what with the limited charges and all. Beyond that most of the bad Alchemy ones are obviously bad  a final tier one makes decoctions last longer but if you already have that many points in Alchemy decoctions are lasting you eighty minutes or so to begin with!,witcher,ctrddtt,2,t5_2sebi
4737699,0,t3_3fsbxv,Id be happy to see some more Scoiatael. Although I find the fall from grace history of the elves refreshing in all its bitterness it would be great to contribute to a nicer outcome for them. I mean I can totally understand their actions while at the same time screaming internally How can you be so stupid! They are totally outclassed by humans and a shadow of what they were.BTW the main story is long enough but following the Scoiatael trend to be on the losing side or being used it would have been interesting if they had allied themselves with Eredin. After all they should be closer to these elves than to humans and a conquered world would probably profit them.

Although the Dragonborn is also affected by the timeslowing effects they are able to move much faster than their enemies while the Shout is active allowing them to attack enemies with less danger of getting hit back.You could blame the fact that it affects you too on your Witcher not being as skilled with Yrden as other Witchers.

4772174,0,t1_ctw2bic,Right but I think that goes more into how the game keeps track of what decisions you make. My point was that failing a goal is contingent on having a conscious goal in mind or a task explicitly given to you. Killing the Barons men is neither as its a spontaneous decision. Having a potential outcome to such an encounter that you did not personally experience listed in your quest log is both confusing to players as well as undercuts the spontaneity of your choice. Geralt cant know that fighting them was inevitable just that he was able to reduce the chances of it happening by acting a certain way. If the game wanted to indicate that a choice was made that had farreaching impact it should just say so in Dandelions synopsis. The fact you were able to skip a good portion of the quest is also selfevident to the player based on the conversation you have with same guards later on at the gate to the keep.,witcher,ctw2pra,1,t5_2sebi

They cant be tricked nor hit only magic can do some harm really powerful magic tho. But still killing an Ifrit for example is impossible.

Id link to it but for ease Ill just post it here its buried in a flood of commentsI dont like this the girl suddenly remarked. Its not as it should be. The dead should to be buried in the ground. Under a barrow. Shouldnt they?They should the magician agreed calmly. I think so too. But the witchers treat this graveyard as a reminder.Reminder of what?Kaer Morhen Triss said as she guided the horse towards the shattered arcades was assaulted. There was a bloody battle here in which almost all the witchers died. Only those who werent in the keep at the time survived.Who attacked them? And why?I dont know she lied. It was a terribly long time ago Ciri. Ask the witchers about it.I have grunted the girl. But they didnt want to tell me.I can understand that thought the magician. A child trained to be a witcher a girl at that who has not undergone the mutations should not be told such things. A child like that should not hear about the massacre. A child like that should not be terrified by the prospect that they too may one day hear words describing it like those which were screamed by the fanatics who marched on Kaer Morhen long ago. Mutant. Monster. Freak. Damned by the gods a creature contrary to nature. No I do not blame the witchers for not telling you about it little Ciri. And I shant tell you either. I have even more reason to be silent. Because I am a wizard and without the aid of wizards those fanatics would never have conquered the castle. And that hideous lampoon that widely distributed Monstrum which stirred the fanatics up and drove them to such wickedness was also apparently some wizards anonymous work.Vesemir was the only witcher left from the previous generation and he was only a fencing instructor. The Laboratorium hidden in the vaults of Kaer Morhen with its dusty demijohns of elixirs the alembics ovens and retorts None of the witchers knew how to use them. The mutagenic elixirs had been concocted by some renegade wizard in the distant past and then perfected over the years by the wizards successors who had over the years magically controlled the process of changes to which children were subjected. And at a vital moment the chain had snapped. There was no more magical knowledge or power. The witchers had the herbs and Grasses they had the Laboratorium. They knew the recipe. But they had no wizard.Blood of Elves,witcher,cucce3z,9,t5_2sebi

The only other I can think of currently was him killing those guys who attacked him in an inn before being brought before Foltest.

I then started this mission you can quickly get through the desert world by running straight to the portal skipping the walkchat with Avallach and Geralt was able to regen breath on the poisongas world as expected.  I guess swimming somehow around reset the mechanism.Worstcase I was fairly desperate before finding the above workaround... I actually made it to the portal without regen breath in the poisongas world by using Werewolf potion stamina doesnt drain outofcombat and taking a ridiculous path.  I took a route towards the Place of Power on the rightside twodrops and you will lose a lot of health... but will not lose ANY breath.  Then take this route  I died when I excitedly went into the portal with  health and immediately drowned in the next world... It MIGHT be possible to get through the underwater world if you have  health but I didnt get a chance to try. ,witcher,cukngm2,1,t5_2sebi

Its also a bit sad how poorly thought through some of the skills are.  Many in the alchemy tree are stuffed because CDPR couldnt decide how decoctions should interact with the toxicity based skills resulting in confusion and nonfunctioning abilities.Gameplay design is just not these guys strengths  I hope some new hires can correct that in future releases.,witcher,cukt5n7,17,t5_2sebi

5039701,0,t1_cutg7gl,What the OP is referring to is how zones require minimum levels to engage in combat unless youre running specific builds. This means that while your movement within and interaction with the games zones arent strictly limited its impractical to play through those zones without being in the correct level range. You cant exactly fasttrack it to Skellige after first arriving in Velen after all. Skellige has a lot of enemies in the level  range and enemies have their attacks and defenses strengthened when they have a red level indicator. When you arrive in Velen from White Orchard your character is likely to be level  or  and you can have collected up to  extra skill points from places of power. This means you can have spent eight skill points in total and will have two accessible skill slots. Entirely impractical for getting things done in Novigrad or Skellige unless youre running mods are playing NG or have a very specific plan for completing content while underlevelled. ,witcher,cuth411,1,t5_2sebi

But there is very little further interaction beyond that city afterwards I felt.

I think you have to use something for the second part like the griffin one. Drink it before the first set of wraiths so that you can take some damage and build up your damage resistance for the next fight. When it comes to the wraiths teleport move try to roll behind where they are appearing to dodge the initial attack then just wait for an opening once they finish the other swings. If other wraiths try to interrupt you beat up on them instead.,witcher,cuzf74m,1,t5_2sebi

5170106,0,t3_3lk22n,A reasonable summary. The key point here is that Geralts dialogue options are often about his relationship with that specific character not about the eternal process of simulating a personality for a blank slate. This makes everything Geralt says linked and credible for the character. And instead of trying to express some overarching moral position were exploring how Geralt interacts with a handful of consistent themes. My biggest problem with the video is hidden towards the beginning. The chooseyourownadventure book analogy creates questionable context because it argues that games can be summarised by turning points in their plot. While I do understand that this is a video about the dialogue NDA never clearly explains why a games content is defined by its narrative choices and dramatic beats rather than or in addition to its gameplay. If this is a game at least partially about what it is to be a witcher doesnt the way we wield a sword also have narrative merit? The combination of measured assertion and caution the game demands is drastically different to the bloodthirstiness of combat in a game like God of War.In short this video begins by asserting a very traditional position on what storytelling is or should be in a game. Its not that I dont see merit in the arguments that follow but to me it always seems incomplete when discussion of a games narrative elements is disconnected from its mechanical elements. Ideally they work in unison to improve the experience and CDPR do a very reasonable job of bringing together those elements in The Witcher . ,witcher,cv96s6h,2,t5_2sebi

It can be very daunting but at the same time very rewarding and youll get the best bang for your buck. The most challenging part is picking out what you need to get. If you dont want to build your own thats perfectly fine I just dont have any knowledge of who has good deals and who is reputable. If you do want to build your own then lets get down to some questions to help guide you into what you want. . What resolution are you planning on? p is the standard full HD resolution that is common on most TVs and is probably the most common one out there. p is better and a step below k. For context witcher runs at between p on xbox. . What refresh rate do you want? Refresh rate is the maximum frames per second youll be able to see on your monitor.  is standard with xbox witcher running at . It goes up to   and . . How many games will you have installed? This determines how big of a hard drive youll want.. How big of a computer do you want? Doesnt really affect performance just a preference.

All they are concerned with is women LBGT and muslims. There are barely any other demographics they even care to represent.EDIT Honestly I can understand why the focus is so great on these three groups because of the potential of extracting economic and political mileage but Id rather get behind a true SJW who focuses more on legal hurdles to having an inclusive atmosphere and general perceptions to the other in all demographics and not just criticizing the majority demographic of a region.

There wasis an issue with certain driver packages from nVidia and Windows   basically when you update to the new version some things fail to update because reasons and you end up with software package that is bits and pieces of old and new versions  hence the crashes.

5423809,0,t3_3pbhts,I just finished this game a couple nights ago after starting playing sometime midJune. I took a couple weeks break a couple of times to wait for patches but the rest of the time I was playing a few hours a night. My life has been really shitty for a while and it was so nice knowing I could escape into this game for a bit whenever I wanted. And now after many many hours its over and I definitely feel a bit empty. I dont think Ive ever gotten so attached to a game world and characters as I have with Witcher  partly because of the huge period of time I played it over and because of what my life is like but also because of how well crafted it is I agree the ending felt a little rushed like every big AAA game with a complex story it seems and I wanted more elaboration on what happened to the characters after the game but I guess there were a bunch of different choices and different characters to account for so it would have been difficult. Anyways its the journey that matters and a wonderful journey it was.,witcher,cw4y4uw,7,t5_2sebi

5426091,0,t1_cw57gjc,gt t is an option its not in the flow chart but the fact that you can go to Arefu is enough to show you that Fallout  has similar branching paths lmfao as Witcher s.No its not. In fact I just checked and you absolutely CANNOT do the quest backwards. If you go to Meresti first there IS no Ian there at all. You can cheatunlock the door to the cell hes not there. So no you cant do it backwards IangtArefugtLucy. He is not placed in the world until you get to the point in the quest where youre supposed to talk to him.Second if you talk to Vance and Family or hack the terminal it merely mentions Incident in Arefu and still sends you to Evan King to actually start the quest. Which is what starts Blood Ties. And from there you have to follow the quest chain without deviation  search first family house search second house report back to King go to Meresti talkkillhack your way to Ian convincenot convince him not an option if you didnt talk to Lucy go back to King with results the end. Talk to Lucy is optional. The steps and order of them is always the same.I JUST checked it myself speedrunning through it using cheats. The steps are set in stone. The quest will NOT advance until you complete the step before it every time. The quest starts and ends at Arefu always. If you run into Meresti before it you get sent to Arefu with no additional info and your character will act when speaking to King that he doesnt know about Family location. And the quest step is still Locate Family even though you already know exactly where they are.I also kinda feel youre confusing the freedom to move around an open sandbox world with freedom to do the quests. You say that being able to go to Arefu is proof of branching paths? Not really. It just means you can pick up the quest from many locations Megaton Arefu or Meresti but you cannot start the quest until you get to Arefu. As in the quest wont advance until Evan King. And from there its a straight line. Always. Check  houses. If you dont check them quest doesnt advance Ian doesnt exist etc. Then you go back to King. King tells you to locate family somehwere across the river even though you already know where it is if you came from Meresti. At this point Ian actually appears ingame. Then you go to the Family and talkhackfight your way to Ian at which point he does appear. If you started with Lucy and have her letter you can talk him into leaving. If you dont you cant. Thats the only real branch there is unless you count talkhackkill to get to Ian as choice but its pretty shallow and determined by your character attributes not by your own choice. And then you go back to Arefu which ends the quest. Always. That chain you always follow. Is that freedom? Hardly. Also its been a while but speedrunning the quest just reminded me how shitty Fallout  dialogue and writing is. And you absolutely cannot go Kinggtfind corpsesgtgo to Ian. You have to go check all  housesgttalk to Kinggtget sent to Meresti. No other way around it. Totally linear.,witcher,cw58ml6,1,t5_2sebi

It doesnt make sense that you can lock onto any monster you encounter in the wild but cant lock onto that same monster in a Witcher Contract fight.Speaking as a nonmodded PC player not sure if its any different on PSIts hard to tell sometimes cause theres no distinct indication that its working but you SHOULD be able to lock onto bosses using the normal controls. You just have to look close to see when your camera snaps over and starts tracking the boss. The main issue is that a lot of bossesmobs have abilities that instantly break your lock anyway Like when a lesser vampire cloaks or a hag dives under the mud and again without that definite indication its hard to tell when it happens. Its especially tricky when you have other enemies around the boss since its so easy to accidentally change your target.,witcher,cw99355,2,t5_2sebi

5472108,0,t3_3px9vh,Handsdown the best game Ive ever played. I played the first  and rushed through them mainly because I was in school at the time and didnt have time and I wasnt all that impressed by the gameplay of the first two so when the rd got announced I wasnt excited and I ignored a lot of the buildup to it. Originally I wasnt going to get it but my ex got it me at release and within the first hour of playing the game I was hooked. The moment I knew this was really something special was during the Bloody Baron quests. The story was heartwrenching and it was an emotional rollercoaster. The game makes you think theres rarely any good or bad black or white decisions its a big grey area. This game made me really think about the morality of situations what would come of things? It made me laugh and cry. The only downside is that after playing a game of this caliber all other games cant hold a candle to it. I bought all the extras the moment I finished the game. Hearts of Stone was just as good.,witcher,cwb43b2,1,t5_2sebi

5517890,0,t3_3qmocw,Great points thank you! I have almost  hours in the game and still feel like I know very little about it. Ill try and see how it plays without the minimap. I think this might be the best point you made yet Im afraid of never reaching where I need to go without it.The thing about the main quest being made out to feel urgent is the one thing that really bothers me for some reason. I feel like betraying Ciri when I go off to fetch a pan for some old lady on the roadside or explore a random tower for my personal gain.The only way I found to reason with this is The Wild Hunt is an epic foe. Although Geralt is an experienced Witcher they are beyond his abilities in the beginning of the game and he knows it. Being a Witcher means knowing how to enter a fight and being fully prepared. Geralt is working towards this because hell eventually have to fight the Wild Hunt to get to Ciri or defend her once he got there nowhere near finished with the story so just a guess. This is how I justify doing all the sidequests and so on. He needs resources and information to deal with this. Only way to get those is to get sidetracked here and there. ,witcher,cwgyl4n,1,t5_2sebi

Witcher  alone has red riding hood snow white and Cinderella if not more. I dont really see where the problem is. Theyre just fun references to figure out and if you dont know the reference it fits into the world fairly naturally. Like I didnt even notice the nietzsche and Marx one until you pointed it out.

6136355,0,t3_3zkxgt,The worst part of it for me was the implications of defying destiny. Geralt has endured so much done so many childish and stupid things and for a long time you can call it destiny. Yet if you really can break the tie  between him and Yen theres no reason why the tie cant break between him and Ciri. So much bloodshed and pain and misery for everyone was ... what? A result of love? Of bad decisions? It raises so many questions. Could he have been happier if hed not tempted destiny by asking Calanthe for a child? If they can break the spell now was anything stopping Yen or Geralt from doing it before? What even was the bond if it could be broken by the two people within it? In my mind its an incredibly sober moment where they realise their own responsibility for everything theyve done. Once and for all they see that they had a choice over everything they did and theres no getting away from it. Whatever you do in that scene theyre suddenly faced with all the stupid things they did the childishness of their smug jokes the sheer number of people that died around them in a way they arent before. Geralt more or less trades on wanting neutrality but being swept along by destiny to escape responsibility for all the idiotic things hes done but suddenly its all real. Its all real and he doesnt even love Yen. Everything is so incredibly monumentally fucked.,witcher,cyn50iy,5,t5_2sebi

6178013,0,t1_cyrvf9y,Of course not. Fallout  is a great game with a gargantuan following. I really do struggle to get into it and I find the world lacking depth. Which is weird because every computer you find has detail and the quests are all optional due to you caring about the motives or not but I just cant find the world enjoyable. That being said..

Its a levelling area only from  to  because quests from these level ranges seem insufficient unless you roam the whole freaking world map.

6186148,0,t1_cysqndi,I honestly think the game is balanced extremely well. Those who just want to complete the main story can do that while completionists and explorers may find plenty of challenge in sideactivities. Once you study it you realize the game juggles the leveled content and lootexp rewards in a very smart way so that the game stays enjoyable from start to finish. I have seen very few games that could do that better. Sure if you decide to do every activity in the game you will eventually become an unstoppable killing machine but I see no way to prevent that with the sheer amount of content Witcher  offers. Im a game designer myself and I had so much fun studying and admiring the balance of the game. CD Projekt REDs crew are amazing for what they did. It is much easier to follow the route of Bethesda shoving the primitive autoleveling system into the game making any kind of exploration boring and pointless yes Oblivion and Skyrim are the worst and laziest examples of that approach. Instead they created a finetuned handcrafted world balance which makes that world feel alive. Is it a perfect system? No of course not. But it is one of the best examples of openworld balancing I have ever seen.,witcher,cysstvl,4,t5_2sebi

6188028,0,t1_cyt015i,Well technically yes but I did it more as a challenge for myself because I was overleveled and was finding combat boring.

The bad ending where she becomes empress could be adapted by perhaps the fall of Nilfgaard and her having to flee then deciding to become a witcher or something like that. As you said in the worst ending she is merely lost for all we know she could have decided to go her separate way opening possibilities for a story.,witcher,czebrql,2,t5_2sebi

When the rest were published translator was replaced and the quality suffered a bit not because of the mistranslations but rather from being clogged with archaisms and borrowed words and by extent with numerous footnotes. Although I never saw the books in Polish so maybe its not a bug but a feature. Maybe Sapkowski got a penchant for abusing the thesaurus in those later books a la George R. R. Martin.  Anyway while reading the books I never got the feeling that something got lost in translation I guess Poles and Serbs are similar enough both linguistically and culturally to avoid that being fellow Slavs.,witcher,czez9p7,2,t5_2sebi

I mix and match nonwitcher gear as long as theyre the same type I go for light armor and have that set as a backup for the only set Ive managed to craft so far griffin. I usually put the witcher gear on for enemies within my level and during the main quest and use my backup when roaming around to do contracts or points of interest.Thats just me though.

6611663,0,t1_d0371u6,gt a quote about WWI is a single bullet killed  million people which is basically what Letho and Emhyr did by killing Foltest and Demavend.   I read it and agree you might not like him but I disagree that Letho is the reason of the war. Even if Letho hadnt assassinated kings there would be war again. Letho was just a pawn like Scoiatael or Lodge but the difference between Letho knows this and trying to do something for his school for witchers. He mentions that witchers are not allowed to enter some cities and we saw that in W how some folks treat witchers. I think he thought he might change something.  Also I agree about Foltest. One of the best things about witcher series is there is no complete black and white. Everything is between those like real life. ,witcher,d037a0m,1,t5_2sebi

6737588,0,t3_47ycjf,Im guessing you have finished the short story or maybe you havent. Spoilers up ahead in case you havent. The reason why he is called the Butcher of Blaviken is because witchers dont kill clean. He butchered a group of bandits in a gruesome way in front of crowds of hundreds of commoners and superstitious peasants. Witchers dont exactly gain the best reputation. The book Monstrum Or Description of the Witcher by Anonymous is as far as I know quite popular and slanders the witchers for being killing machines. It is their job after all. They have superhuman abilities they can move extremely quickly they have sharp reflexes and incredible strength in comparison to a normal bandit. It would probably be the first time the citizens of Blaviken would witness such a fight. Thats why they call him the Butcher of Blaviken. ,witcher,d0g83ul,5,t5_2sebi

But the good thing is you still have to improvise mix and match signs potions bombs and sword skills at least  of them to play effectively. I dont agree with the people that say the game combat is revolutionary or very good but its far far far from bad.The boss fights are pretty badly designed though especially Imlerith and Eredin which I both beaten on first try.

I mean the dude left his wife expected her to just wait around for him like a hat on a coat rack murdered her lover when she left him then practically kept her hostage for the rest of her life.

7189065,0,t1_d1uqem3,gt Why are you asking? I get that you dont wanna get dissapointed by the games but how is it any different because you read the books?  Take for an example Dandelion. As of right now I have read all the books but played none of the games. My personal inmyownhead perception of Dandelion is  informed by the books and  informed by the games. Once Ive played the games and seen that interpretation of him my personal perception of him will be informed partially by the one and partially by the other. It is possible if it is bad enough which I doubt it will be that the game version of Dandelion will influence my view of him to the point that I retroactively like my memory of him from the books less.  Another good example I can think of is the Matrix films. A lot of people really loved the first one but after seeing how badly the second and third turned out it made them like the first one less by association. Im not saying that will happen with the Witcher by playing the games because Im sure they cant be that bad or even that theyre bad at all but the possibility is there and there are some things as outlined in the OP that are making me worried along those lines.,witcher,d1vc336,1,t5_2sebi

I cannot finish games front to back but TW was the first game I actually finished in  years. I wish I could go back to that day and experience it like it was new all over again. BampW will give me that feeling and I know Im going to be really bummed out when its over but I will love every minute of that excitement not knowing whats next.

7430404,0,t1_d2m8es3,This. Is CDPR supposedly sexist for how the women look or for how theyre treated by men in the game? Because telling people their women characters should wear more clothes or look different is sexist not the other way around. Plenty of women kick ass in Witcher although the Witcher is a more realistic and gritty world than many games. Usually people dont go around kicking ass like that in real life and CDPR shows the other side of that. If people cant handle content like sexual assault rape women being tortured then maybe they should go play a kids game or something and stop being babies. Its just PC crap calling CDPR sexist. I dont think the devs care. I think they just wanted people to hear about their game which is fine. But to all the feminists who cry over rape and shit in games and movies its not sexist go live in a bubble if you cant handle real life.,witcher,d2msfy2,0,t5_2sebi

Not sure why you didnt get some of the DLCs those are free items and not necessarily tied to the main account holder. For HoS and BaW or the season pass your brother has to purchase the DLCs for you to access them from your Xbox. Hope that helps!EDIT just to clarify you can buy the DLC yourself but only youll be able to access it unless your brothers Xbox is set to your home Xbox.

Yes there are times when Yennefer expects Geralt to do something but its because she actually trusts him that he can and will handle shit she knows him  times better than Triss. Because all in all they work together to find Ciri. She doesnt tell him to buy her pretty dresses or whatever. She even tells him when Geralt is like  I will come back. With Ciri . And Yens like I know. Then later after Imleriths fight she shows  trust in him and support unlike your Triss whos panicking that you put Ciri in danger.gt Also Yen did mindcontrol him at one timeYou keep bringing it back. Yes it WAS shitty. But it happened when they didnt know each other at all to Yen Geralt was a complete stranger and annoying one. She didnt owe him anything. On the other hand when Triss was doing all this shit to Geralt she KNEW him she considered herself his friend. But more importantly she considered herself Yennefers friend.

7607700,0,t3_4jivr5,Ill tackle all these questions as best I can and in the order you asked them.Hearts of Stone the st expansion adds nothing to the base game all of its content isnt accessible until youre about Lvl  and is recommend to be done after you finish the main game anyway so theres no need to buy it until you beat the main story. Blood and Wine isnt out until the st so its not something you need to worry about buying right now but in case you dont beat the main story by the st you may wish to buy it anyway as its said to include some new mechanics to the mutation system and adds new armour. Whether or not the armour and other additions will only be available in the new area of Touissant available at Lvl  remains to be seen though.Side quests arent so hard to miss. Just check every single notice board you see and keep an eye out for exclamation marks on the map as theyre people who offer quests as well.Witcher contracts are the best guranteed way to earn good money you can also explore Velen clearing out monster nests bandit camps and caves in doing so acquiring a lot of loot which you can then sell on for profit.Depending on your difficulty what skills you want by the time you arrive in Velen differs. If youre on Blood and Broken Bones or Death March for instance youll want the skill which allows you to regenerate vitality during the day since Vitality doesnt recover when meditating on those difficulties as itll save you using food and potions to recover your health when outside of a fight. Id also recommend upgrading Quen asap as Quen will save your ass so damn much in the game. That and just upgrade the signs you find yourself using the most and put some points into upgrading fast attack so youll do more damage. Rest is really up to you and how you play.Notice boards do not replenish quests what you get upon looking at them the first time is all youll get but theres plenty of notice boards and plenty of quests.Save often. Sort of a no brainer but Witcher  encourages it especially when you can suddenly get  hit by an enemy  levels above you because you wandered into an area youre too weak to explore yet. Saving also helps tremendously should you run into any bugs or glitches,witcher,d36yf8u,1,t5_2sebi

So its sort of like a blinking pixel on your monitor. The cells dont work in sync they fire their impulses randomly so imagine a monitor with pixels blinking randomly all over the place.

7785178,0,t1_d3r2ro4,I mean you can call it an expansion as much as you want I personally also refer to it as an expansion rather than DLC. But the fact remains that technically it is a piece of downloadable content.Now this is not a big deal many people are willing to call it an expansion so as to avoid association with smaller pieces of DLC that often nickelndime Horse Armor but you cant go around correcting people who call it DLC when they are technically correct.And okay I grant you that Wikipedia isnt the best source but its definitely the most prominent link you find when googling for DLC or definitions thereof so Id wager it has some merit. Furthermore here are other links that share the definition with Wikipedia  and The first link doesnt look to be anything extraordinary but the second is GiantBomb. Id definitely call them reliable. They describe an Assassins Creed season pass as DLC comprising of  expansions thus not defining expansion and DLC as mutually exclusive as you seem to do.,witcher,d3r3yiy,7,t5_2sebi

7818304,0,t3_4mdo30,I played the games before reading the books and feel that my experience was a little deprived because Im playing the main campaign again and am seeing a lot of references to the books I never would have known before. That continuity makes the alreadycompelling story and characters even richer.The games have surprisingly little references between them and for the most part you can probably ignore them and be ok honestly. I see more references to the books than what happened in the previous two games. Because both of the games are not very short it could be a more rewarding experience on the basis of time alone to read first than play anyway.Of course none of this really applies if youre not really compelled by the story and setting much in the first place but you need to give it a good hour or so in before it clicks.

7831479,0,t1_d3p9i34,Hey Everyone I got another reply concerning the Dual Shock  icons disappearing patch ..  The CDPR team is pretty awesome they actually took the time to read my email to support and even look into the matter! Theyve submitted that the icons are missing and they might be added in a future patch! Here is the reply I received from supportThank you for your kind words and the link  The thing is that support for the controller wasnt ninja removed it was ninja added. There are many people working on the game thousands upon thousands of changes are submitted and internal changes are not published in patch notes. Apparently a developer added support and didnt let anyone or at least the people compiling the patch notes know that a change worth mentioning was added so it was lost among thousands of internal changes. The game is tested on the PC using Xbox controllers and mampk and my team also uses them so we didnt know support for PS controller was there.After our initial exchange with you we tested that indeed the icons were there pre. and are absent now. Please understand that at this time the dev team works on a very tight schedule but I submitted the icon issue for consideration.Kind regardsKarolina Niewgowska,witcher,d3wbqiz,6,t5_2sebi

This will greatly increase the chance to draw strongHeroes cards. Collect as many spies decoys and medic as you can. Always save medic for the final round to revive the opponent spiesif any on your deck. Choose the clear weather ability of your king. Against stronger gwent factions like Skelliger Monster if they go all in the first round dont try to match their card sizes but instead throw in every spies you have and concede the round.

7961271,0,t3_4o90xc,Ill admit at the outset of the HoS quests I wasnt particularly enthralled. I was definitely glad to see the introduction of the Olfieri and loved meeting Olgierd and Gaunter ODimm seriously the best villain in the game and getting to spend time with Shani but the starting quests didnt really seem to gel at first. Then slowly the pieces start to come together as you uncover more and more of the story connecting these characters. The writers manage to tell a very intimate personal tale that is a welcome break from the world and cosmossaving main quest where Geralts involved in events of great import but which dont really have a human side or any resonance on a personal level. I wasnt expecting the story in HoS to take place on such a smaller scale but it was a brilliant move for the writing and plot design.I just finished Scenes from a Marriage last night and I was just gutted by the end and paralyzed by the choice. The story of Iris is so utterly tragic and sad. I have less sympathy for Olgierd but even there he was trying to do what he did out of love for her. That quest is the kind that stays with you where you get so invested that you question your choices and your role and you wonder about what might have been if only things had turned out a little differently. ,witcher,d4ax7l0,3,t5_2sebi

7999659,0,t3_4opuul,Its a new set of armors amp swords for each school with the addition of the Manticore School set. Each set has its own special perk for wearing the pieces. For example with the Grandmaster Wolven set if you wear  out of the  pieces chest trousers gauntlets boots steel sword amp silver sword you unlock the ability to be able to coat upto  different blade oils at one time to a blade. The Wolven set is my absolute favorite because of this specific perk. I can now keep Insectoid relic amp ogroid oil on my sword all at once so there isnt a need to always stop amp pick a new oil each time I have to fight something on the road. My specific preference is Grandmaster Wolven gauntlets trousers amp boots so I get the  out of  amp the Viper chest armor because sexy. That way I can also use what ever swords I want with it. Remember that each school has its own perks so it does pay off to find all of the sets for each.,witcher,d4f8kmg,1,t5_2sebi

Most of the times I dont even use my sword at all I just keep casting Igni  times and watch everything burn while I just relax there. Shielded enemies wont catch on fire for too long thats why you should use Firestream to get them to drop their shields. The new mutation Piercing Cold made the sign build even more ridiculous. When Im facing multiple enemies I just roll in the middle of them and cast the alternate Aard sign until they are all dead. Sometimes I instakill  enemies with only one cast. Also because there are a few encounters where you cant use your signs or the enemy is just immune to them I use some skills from the fast attacks tree.,witcher,d4fmiog,1,t5_2sebi

One much more memorable character in particular.BampW is more relaxing and it has a much nicer more romantic view on the Witcher universe as opposed to HoSs dark nature. Its got dark undertones but its nothing compared to HoS. As a result its kind of less intense but still pretty enthralling. They both play differently I found HoS to be a more intense story dash because I wanted to see the outcome and Id been in the land before. Its in Velen. With BampW I explored a lot more it was more of a relaxed trip and the story just seemed right for me to do that.

I find it so strange because the mechanic isnt mentioned by the game anywhere offers zero tactical advantage over the shoulder animation which is easier to perform and lastly no other mechanics work quite that way.

8326363,0,t3_4tm3k2, From uAgentNebraska gt If youre still having trouble let me tell you you are quite certainly not alone in this struggle. gtThe only consistent indicator for the bats I found was to watch the formation very carefully. When they start forming around him they are in a very disorganized blob but eventually form up into a tall columnshaped cloud. I found that the technique that worked the best for me was rolling to the side directly after the cloud forms its maximum height behind Dettlaff. It took me a couple of times but on my first successful Dettlaff battle I took zero damage in the second stage using this method. gtAnother thing that helps a lot is shortening the second stage by taking advantage of his other more predictable attacks. I also use signs and I found it helpful to switch between Igni and Aard throughout the battle when he flew into the air I switched to Aard and looked out for his swoopacrosstheskyandslice attack making sure to time the blast right when he stutters in front of Geralt. This knocks him from the sky and allows a quick Igni blast and  sword strikes which quite effectively helps shorten the time you have to spend on stage . Igni does substantial damage whenever Dettlaff hits the ground and also has a small risk factor as you can cast it from a short distance away. gtHe has one last attack from the sky where he disappears from the shot and then reappears on the ground near Geralt. This one is relatively easy to avoid just dodge when you see that weird vampire goop form around Geralt. From there hit him with an Igni and  quick attacks and you should make substantial cut into Dettlaffs health. gtIf youre still having trouble with him I urge you to try these methods out. Good luck!,witcher,d5icm8z,5,t5_2sebi

Orianna has no difficulties at all making flowery speeches like a fullblown noble. She not only spends some time near humans cue the bruxa at the start shes a part of the social elite. Shes super cultured. Bruxae arent. Her little farm of children seems very similar to the farms mentioned at Tesham Mutna that the Higher Vampires experimented with. She knows about the Unseen Elder whos also a Higher Vampire. She talks to and about Regis like an equal. If we disregard the trailer it seems very strongly implied that shes a genuine Higher Vampire. And the trailer well ... its a cinematic trailer? Theyre often not  canon. Video games reuse voice actors and d models all the time as well. They build on things previously only mentioned retcon minor things when they make further developments. Thats not strange.Ill say she isnt a bruxa because nothing in the actual game suggests that she is. Not a single thing. A lot of things however imply that she most definitely isnt one. If they said shes a bruxa they might as well change the lore about bruxa because they arent making bruxa they way they say bruxa should be. Seems more likely that they just changed things from the trailer.,witcher,d5yi8bq,1,t5_2sebi

When Ciri finds out she is destined to be given to Geralt. Ciri wants to go with Geralt to become a Witcher. She hates being a princess. Geralt doesnt want her exactly cuz shes a princess and a girl witcheress doesnt exist. So he sends her back to the palace. Monthsyears pass and news comes that Cintra got attacked by Nilfgaard it was burned to the ground. And a lot of random coincidences happen where Geralt invokes the law of surprises on a random person he meets on the road and saves his life from a monster. The man says I know what youre expecting from this but Im not gonna be expecting a child any time soon. Nonetheless they go back to where he lives and turns out that Ciri has miraculously escaped from the attack and is living in this mans hut as a refugee.That is when this scene happens.Edit This is a very shitty explanation in retrospect. Theres a lot more going on like Geralt blaming himself that he couldve saved her. Him being almost mortally wounded and having some flashbacks regarding ciri under the drugs influence.

I tried to do all the quests below my level in VelenNovigrad before leaving to Skelliege to follow main quest and I ended up level  when I got thereand I play on Deatch March which has reduced exp gain. Since Skelliege is like level  zone there was quite a few quests that gave me no exp. I realy dont mind it since I am seriously overleveled already.In other worlds there is an abundance of experience to earn. It was designed this way so ppl have some freedom if it comes to doing quests. This way PPl who wish to follow mostly main story or simply dont want to complete every quest wont end up underleveled. And no exp for quests over  levels lower rule is there so people who like do do everything wont overlevel content by too much.,witcher,d6t4spi,1,t5_2sebi

8702715,0,t3_4z6wfe,I think the game is best experienced alone with headphones on and preferably on PC. The console on a couch next to a friend setting doesnt quite capture the somber and personal tone of the story and soundvisual design.I really appreciated the complex morally grey choices you have to make and their impact on the way the story develops. Its a far cry from the usual rpg fare where youre the chosen one leading a band of lilywhite do gooders to defeat the embodiment of pure evil. I appreciated the attention to detail they put into the multitudes of side characters and the background environment. This was the first time a game showed me the gritty dirty reality of a feudalera countryside. In the end I felt like the choices I made mattered I wasnt just following a predetermined path where everything turns out ok no matter what.

8708883,0,t3_4zahjl,Use the abilities you were given in combat. Dodge is your default escape. When fighting humans drowners wolves etc. you can just hold right click and block all attacks until you feel ready to strike. You can use parry but I find that parry isnt needed. Use signs. Almost every enemy is weak to one. Figure out which sign your enemy is weak to either by experimenting or reading the bestiary and it will be helpful. I found quen to be especially useful you can always rely on it if no other sign works. Loot everything you should be finding food in notime. Ive never ran out of food and I never bought any. Looting weapons is usually enough to keep your gear around your level at all times and if not then you can always buy swords from smiths or craft them with blueprints youve found while looting everything. Youll have the money to do these things because you can sell your loot.This is not a hard game but it is harder than most. You arent invincible even to common grunts.,witcher,d6u8vj2,1,t5_2sebi

For Roche you help him with his side quest with Ves. For Hjalmar I think you have to help Cerys get onto the throne of Skellige and then ask her for help and shell send him.

Youre right that it wouldnt be beyond belief that someone of his calibre could easily have manipulated important plot events but in truth thats just entertaining speculation. I think a huge part of his appeal as a villain comes from just how far above everything else he is compared to anything weve encountered in the series.

9018913,0,t1_d7vn2ls,The Witcher  really tried to do something impressive for what was essentially an indie studio at the time. They adapted an old bioware engine for middleaughts overtheshoulder DampD games and changed up the gameplay so dramatically you could  hardly recognize the underlying engine. The game was held back by a HORRIBLE original translation and the gameplay while innovative didnt always work but it was definitely a breath of fresh air. TW was the highlight of the series for me once you could get it running with all the goodies on except forget ber sampling its been obsolete for a while now and surpassed by better hardware systems. But anyway yeah the combination of the combat the need to still plan ahead with alchemy the deep skill tree the fantastic environments the forests around Flotsom are still one do the best game environments in any fantasy game to this day and of course the story tw made for a tighter but perhaps better constructed game experience than even tw. There are a couple of mods I play with tw however that really go a long way towards bringing back that feel to tw. First is a potion rebalance mod that generally lengthens potions timers and toxicity while rebalancing things like swallow and tawny owl so theyre not OP. You can also optionally make almost all potions except stillshort buffs like thunderbolt and blizzard impossible to drink while in combat to make it more like previous games. The other is the Immersive Camera mod which is just the bees knees. I vastly preferred the generally tighter camera of of tw where Geralt is closed to the viewpoint and looms larger in frame. This camera mod basically allows you to tweet every camera setting for different situations too and uses an excellent option menu to help as well not to mention hotkeys. Good stuff all around. ,witcher,d7vxkk6,5,t5_2sebi

9020894,0,t1_d7vsbj7,I honestly wouldnt even consider the voice acting in TW to be bad. A lot of it is genuinely good and on par with anything in TW. The problem is that the quality bar is all over the place and goes down in some places for no apparent reason. The performances for a lot of characters in TW  Thaler Zoltan Foltest Velerad numerous side characters  Id consider to be genuinely good. Its just that the bad performances colour peoples opinions of it.That and the audio production. I have no idea what went on with the audio production for the English version of TW but the audio quality is all over the place. Its clear that all the performances were recorded on professional microphones in a studio but it sounds like half the actors had their heads very close to the mic half were far away half received audio engineering in postproduction and half didnt half have random white noise in the background half dont. I think a lot of that is probably down to the Enhanced Edition where they brought back numerous actors to rerecord lines that were truncated in the original English translation  I guess they didnt necessarily have the time or budget to ensure complete audio consistency which is a shame.Either way though  I really think people give TW a lot of unfair criticism on the voice acting front.

9131397,0,t1_d89fub9,Exactly. This is how you combat pirating  you show the torrenters that youre not just a faceless corporation only out to make as much money as possible. Instead you offer a brilliant game competitively priced that is evidently the culmination of hundreds of individuals wanting to make something truly remarkable. Then even going as far as supporting those whom torrent in the hopes they may want to support the company but with no obligation to do so. CDPR really are setting the standard for how the gaming industry should be. Theyre showing that being a public company doesnt necessarily mean screwing over their audience to make money for shareholders.

This change doesnt necessarily mean the production company logged in and changed the status nor does it mean the movie is on hold this is most likely IMDb changing it themselves because they havent heard from the production company on a status change in several months. I cant remember exactly how long theyll wait before automatically changing the status but this happens all the time with IMDb entries either because the project has been abandoned and will eventually be removed by IMDb its status has actually fallen back into In Development but hasnt been changed by the project owner or whoever was supposed to keep the info updated on IMDb just forgot.,witcher,d89zbif,9,t5_2sebi

9501666,0,t1_d9k53m8,Yes absolutely. In W you only have to craft potions and decoctions and oils once. After that they autofill during meditation for  alcohest. Never craft alcohest since its in sacks all over and cheap to buy. Because of that I recommend crafting any potion and decoctions and oils that you think you might ever use.Feel free to use your potions liberally though obviously dont waste them. Even on death march I never ran out of refills. Keep an eye on your toxicity the green status bar  potions increase your toxicity and high toxicity  will cause detrimental effects. You clear your toxicity by waiting or meditating.Oils are another thing to consider. They give you a slight boost towards the target monster and cost very little. You just need to apply them whenever they run out. you can apply them midfight without issueDecoctions are incredibly powerful potions but they max out your toxicity fast. Without acquired tolerance alchemy trait they arent very useful. With acquired tolerance youll never enter a fight without one. ,witcher,d9ka734,1,t5_2sebi
9503786,0,t1_d9k4p6k,I actually just finished the story so I can answer that. The Wild Hunt only had the powerknow how to send small armiesraiding parties through at a time but what they were looking to do was evacuate the entire population from their world into Geralts world because it was in the process of undergoing an extinction event the encroachment of the White Frost.

Had Vesemir used Axii there was a good chance that  Ciri would have rushed to his aid in the center of the most powerful members of the Wild Hunt.  Ciri needed to get away but shed never have left him in that situation.  Vesemir did the only thing he could do to save Ciri and that was sacrifice himself in what is probably the most noble act in the entire game.  So its not that Vesemir wasnt as capable as Geralt it was that in his mind the only way to save Ciri was to give his own life.  In many ways Vesemir was like a Grandfather to Ciri and its sad that he lies in a grave at an abandoned Kaer Morhen with the ruins of the once great Witcher School crumbling around him. Vesemir saved the person who saves the world and there isnt so much as a Statue or  a city street named after him but such is the life of a Witcher. ,witcher,d9ls35m,32,t5_2sebi

That would remove their polymorphic medium. Im pretty sure the two are dead for good and the third ran off somewhere else not the tapestry. ,witcher,dabbpik,1,t5_2sebi

I dont like having to drink several potions every time I battle and more often than not I go without them because I go in guns brazing honestly I dont want to worry about having the right potion at the right time I just wanna kill stuff.  So I was recently searching for a CombatSigns build to respec into and came up with this one on my own Im a very amateur player so I dont know how it stands in terms of being a good build but Ive read that mostly every build is fine and while some are more OP than others none will give you much trouble.

The water and HBAO make everything look fantastic. The lighting definitely seems to have taken a step up.

9785233,0,t3_5fcz3r,These two things are unrelated.You get ability points throughout that game that you can use to unlock permanent ability upgrades. You get one point every time you level up and also one point the first time you visit each individual place of power. The upgrades from these abilities are permanent though you do have to assign them to slots to be able to use them.When you visit a place of power in addition to the ability point you get on your first visit you also get a temporary boost to one of your signs that has nothing to do with your skill tree. So if you see igni sign intensity increased and your igni usually does  damage then now it will do  damage just a guess I dont know the actual numbers. This buff lasts for some amount of time ingame and then expires. Unlike the extra ability point which you only get the first time you draw from a particular place of power you can buff your signs as many times as you want from any given place of power.,witcher,daj8riv,6,t5_2sebi

9795322,0,t3_5ff0ta,These are rules I keep during playing and theyve served me well so far.    Use Northern Realms deck. Play everyone you can at the start of the game and purchase every card you can from every merchant you meet who has them for sale. You need the spy cards medic cards and so forth since the Gwent players do get more challenging as you move forward.   I like to keep a lot of the freeze cards to counter monster decks because they tend to be very heavily reliant on close combat cards.  I keep a lot of decoys in my deck to counter Nilfgaard decks since they tend to be heavy on spies. I change my Northern leader card to Foltest siege bonus card since that will help you destroy opponents by doubling your siege cards.  The computer goes all out in the first round.  If your hand isnt great just try to throw the first round but use your lower number cards to make the computer use up as many of their cards in the first round as possible.  Keep your strong cards for rounds  and .  Keep your medic cards for rounds  and  unless during round  the computer pulls a burn card and takes away a key card from you.  Ill keep the medic cards to use for the end of the round just in case the computer burns one of my key cards during the round.    Play your spies in round .  If you lose any round it will be round  so its okay to trade having more cards for round  and  in exchange for giving the computer points in round . If you pickup a spy in rounds  or  play them at the start of each round.   Hold on to your high value cards and combos until the end.  Remember the computer may have a burn card and what I try to do is to lead with weak working up to strong in the hopes that if the computer does pull out a burn card Ill only lose a smaller value card and not one of my higher value cards.   Hero cards are awesome. Remember theyre not impacted by weather so sometimes you can play that to your advantage.  However remember if you use a lot of Hero cards in one round and the computer starts to use decoys and gives you the round you cant use a decoy of your own to pull back any of your hero cards for use in a subsequent round. Avoid the temptation to use just hero cards turn after turn after turn.  Beating the computer by  points in round  is a waste if you have decoys you can use to recall some of your cards for rounds  and .  Learn the enemy decks weaknesses.  Monster cards are vulnerable to freeze cards.  Nilfgaard is heavily reliant on spies and can be countered easily with decoys.  Scoiateal decks have either one spy card or no spy cards at all.  As you make progress youll get more cards in your decks and just get better at playing.  My last play through I basically couldnt be beat by the computer anymore.  Perhaps  time out of  the computer would beat me.  My current NG play through even with terrible cards starting off I can typically beat the computer  out  times. ,witcher,dakhh5p,2,t5_2sebi

There are a few quests where playing a game of Gwent is presented as an alternate way of resolving a certain issue but theres always one or more other options to continue excluding Gwentspecific quests of course!.Many people will probably tell you youre missing out but I did my first playthrough while ignoring Gwent and there was more than enough to do and its far easier to just fixate on the story that way. Im doing a second playthrough with Gwent now to see what all the fuss is about and find it mildly interesting but I like the rest of the game still much more.

Im like level  and Im taking on level  creatures on Death March by blasting them with Igni  times in a row all at once. Then I dodge and dodge maybe hit too to get my adrenaline points back up and I repeat.

Its cinematography is phenomenal the work and labour put into it is amazing and its overall an excellent movie I just dont like it.In the same vein I get why some people dont like Sapkowskis work but chapters like Thanedd Tir Na Lia every single scene with Vysogota and especially the Battle of Brenna and the storm on Stygga are from a narrative and literary point of view phenomenally written. ,witcher,dbi1rye,1,t5_2sebi

10134077,0,t3_5l0qlj,Im sure you can find some online but heres the general lowdown. In White Orchard make sure to both beat the scholar who teaches you Gwent and buy the cards from the innkeeper. Not sure if missable but theres a guy in Vizima courtyard you can fight for a card. Do any of the ones listed in the quest log as soon as possible so as not to miss your chance to play them. This includes Bloody Baron Dijsktra an innkeep and Madman Lugos. Lambert is a bit tricky. In the later parts of Following the Thread you can opt to meet him at a destination then immediately talk to him to play him. Otherwise wait until Kaer Morhen but do it before the battle or you miss your chance. Dont forget Thaler. Best time to do this is during Deadly Plot after saving him from trolls. There is the High Stakes tournament make sure to make manual saves so that you make sure you win every round. In Triss quest A Matter of Life and Death make sure not to miss the Gwent side tourney. Again use manual saves to ensure you win all  cards Finally make sure to keep the cards after the Dangerous Game quest for Zoltan. You wont find them anywhere else.None of the few Hearts of Stone cards are required for achievements and as for the Skellige deck you cant miss any of it as theyre all tied to the Gwent quest line. Other than that just play every merchant you see and always make sure to buy the cards from innkeeps. Once you have few enough cards left you can look up the card to find out where it is.,witcher,dbsh43s,2,t5_2sebi

Without them the games would be a cheap attempt at world building. Who knows what that would even look like. The games arent nearly fleshed out enough to fully stand on their own. Sapkowski provided all of the context. The games are really really well written and they could at least be fun on their own. But they would be more akin to assasins creed without the source material.

If I translate this word for word into German it turns into an expression of surprise Na so etwas!

10443846,0,t3_5pknpl,NG simply allows you to retain any equipment obtained in your first game when you start a new one. When you start NG you select a save file it has to be a save file where you completed the game and everything in your inventory stash and what you had equipped come with you as well as your character build. Armor weapons alchemy items alchemy recipes and skill points.Enemies and gear all get leveled up so if your character is say level  then the easiest enemies are gonna be around level  or so. And the lowest gear you find will be level . So basically everything goes the same in terms of character leveling.Same with witcher gear you can for example take your mastercrafted witcher gear and wear it to start NG. But its level  and then some random gloves you find are like level  or whatever. ALL the quests are the same and relatively leveled so if you want to continue with the witcher gear you gotta go through the same hunts crafting upgrading etc. Its just called legendary witcher gear but its all the same.The biggest advantages to NG IMO is that you have the alchemy recipes and skills with you at the start.There are no trophies or achievements whatever that are dependent on NG because NG was added later due to popular demand. So using it is purely based on if you feel like bringing the stuff with you from previous game. Personally I think its rather pointless because any gear you bring with you quickly remains underpowered due to the leveling system. I also actually like building the characters and alchemy stuff as I go... but if your save file has say Whirl and Acquired Tolerance skills or whatever you like you can experience the game with those from the start and some people like that.Ok other questions...If you beat the game on Death March you will also get the Blood amp Broken Bones trophy.The hardest trophies are... well beating the game on Death March. You have to start it in Death March and NEVER change it. Some people have reported issues with it it might be bugged I dunno Im on PC and didnt have a problem.The nd hardest is probably to collect all the gwent cards. This requires some planning and there are plenty of tips online. In short you have to be aware of cards that are only available on quests and hence missable you have to play lots of NPCs to get randomly rewarded cards and it really helps to keep a log of whom youve already beaten as each NPC can reward one and only one card.Note this is a different larger accomplishment than the Collect Em All quest you are assigned in the beginning of the game. To complete the quest you need one of each card type. To get the trophy though you need all copies of all cards some cards have multiple copies.Some trophies require certain ingame dialogue choices like having all available allies with you at the Battle of Kaer Morhaen. Keira is the easily missable one.Most of the trophies are unlocked by being careful and through doing all side stuff you can etc.The ones that require you killing a certain number of foes in a certain way are best done after beating the game and acquiring some potions of clearance. By that point you will have got the Death March trophy so you can drop the difficulty level to easy and then Aard  bandits off a cliff or whatever those are.The Devils Pit area has bandits that respawn when you fast travel away to another map like Skellige then fast travel back. Useful for spamming some of these achievements.The hardest most infamous of these is headshot  enemies with the stupid crossbow... ugh. Save this for last when you will be motivated to grind through this last stupid trophy.The DLCs have trophies associated with them so you cant platinum without them. Fortunately they are really great and worth playing on their own.Heart of Stone has one particularly difficult trophy that involves fighting like  of the same guy. This one just requires patience and trialanderror.Blood amp Wine trophies are easy but to get them all you have to play through its different endings so you can just reload save files and do that.,witcher,dcrw4n7,7,t5_2sebi

10609769,0,t3_5rsko7,While I loved the game there are a lot of things I thought were done really poorly mainly how the main story ended. Spoilers Mainly I hated how Ciri was supposed to sacrifice herself to save the world and how after doing so she just turned out to be alive. This kind of deus ex machina is only there to satisfy the average player but doesnt help the story and as someone who loves a good story I just felt used by the writers. Also the ending where she does die is awful both because in order to reach it you need to be a dick towards Ciri and also because of how Geralt reacts to her death. A man whos supposedly seen everything and whos lived a great many years should just see this as something that happens he should be sad but not THAT desperate as he is shown to be in the ending.Spoilers Another thing I really disliked which has always been a thing in previous games in the series was having to look for somebody the whole game. And everytime youre looking for someone you need to first look for somebody else who might know where they are. And before that you need to look for someone who knows directions that would point you towards the right path to reaching the person thatll help you reach your other person. Its a whole lot of meaningless searching which gets dull immediately and I hope CDPR doesnt get baited into repeating the same process in future games.Hearts of Stone Spoilers I also really disliked how you could beat ODimm in Hearts of Stone or at the very least how easy it was and how that solution came out of nowhere during the last  minutes of gameplay. Here we are dealing with one of the most powerful entities in the univand hes gone. Definitely thought that was rushed and feel that the true ending is the other one in which Olgierd dies.Blood and Wine Spoilers In this one I really hated how you have this guy whos killing half a city and the only way for you to get to the good ending is by NOT trying to stop him the quickest way possible but insted you gotta travel through fairytaleland and hope that things are just gonna work out. I mean I love me a good story but am I to miss one of the best quests in the game because of it? Hell no its not THAT good.Spoilers On another note while I loved the concept of Roachs quest I did feel extremely disappointed at the end of it when I discovered how rushed it was. Here I am taking care of this entity thats been plaguing this womans existence for god knows how long and she doesnt even want to know what it was? Closure? No? Aight.Also as an extra I despised all sections that required you to talk to Golems. God those were drawn out so much longer than necessary and were never funny. Except that one time that Radovid got called Ravodid. But thats it.I recall having problems with many other quests but its been a while since I played the game so I cant really recall them all too well. Aside from all this Ive got the same issues with the game as everybody else I suppose i.e. Djikstra being a really interesting character until the point when he goes mad the King of the Hunt being really uninteresting etc.,witcher,ddabepc,1,t5_2sebi

10650610,0,t3_5set6b,My recommendations for starting a New Game after making some mistakes. . Dont make all the grandmaster witcher gear. Make one set of our preference. Or you can make it all for funsies but make a separate NG save before you do it. That armor will be outclassed very quickly its sad I know.. Get Aerondight. It levels with you. It will be your one amazing silver sword evers.. Finish off all the Blood and Wine mutations even at a cost to your other abilities. BW expansion gives you all the resources you need get mutagens. Mutagens are very hard to get in the main game. I started a NG without doing this and ended up with nearly  extra ability points I couldnt spend because I lacked the slots the mutagens give and no way of farming mutagens. Also NG destroys nearly all your mutagens you have in your inventory. But you get to keep your new mutations.. Same as  but save all your gold. While your grandmaster armor will be quickly outclassed money is money. It carries over. I have k now just finished the baron questline in NG no cheatsexploits.

Besides unless there is a scoring method to compare runs its stupid. I like how forza does its difficulty you can essentially go from  extra credits to like  bonus when choosing difficulty.

Do you honestly think peace would have lasted? Not a chance. Nilfgaard would have attacked them again eventually and would win because Roche and crew gave up too much territory for short term peace.

10887213,0,t3_5vky0v,Combat is quite fast paced and in the early hours of the game your default armor will do you little to no good. Try to explore a bit. Youll start off in a place called White Orchard its very small so you shouldnt struggle to find stuff. If you hear humming and find a glowing rock go up to it and hold the sprint button down to draw. You will get a point to put into your character. Also if you like in game games you may get addicted to Gwent. If you want ill try to explain how it works though it is quite complicated. There are lots of things to do and you should have fun as long as you can be patient. Some battles may need oils potions and bombs to make it easier. If you see chests they may have manuscripts for alchemy creations. Take weapons and armor if you find some. If its crappy sell weapons to a blacksmith and armor to an armorsmith. If you find things called ltnamegts first map take it and read it. It will start a scavenger hunt to find Witcher gear. Just follow the objective markers and look around. Keep in mind that there are  levels for upgrading witcher gear. You need to find all  maps and diagrams to use them though. The last level is Mastercrafted though you need to do a special quest to access a master armorblacksmith. There are  major kinds Witcher gears. Feline Griffin Bear Ursine amp Wolven. Feline is for damage Griffin is for signs Bear is for protection and Wolven is for a bit of each.,witcher,de2xsl4,1,t5_2sebi

10938827,0,t3_5w3xto,This is what I did recently. I finished The Witcher  before break and just finished Assassins of Kings a few weeks ago and Im twentysomething hours into Wild Hunt. I found the change in so many game systems from one game to the next really jarring. Basically the only things that carry over are  having two swords  potion names and  steel on people silver on notpeople. Literally everything else changes. Alchemy and gathering ingredients combat levelling skill trees crafting bombs and traps... I felt like I was playing a completely different game. I did kind of start to get used to it at the end of Witcher ... Only to have the exact same thing happen all over again in Wild Hunt. I miss a lot of things about the combat system from Witcher  and the way you could carry a bunch of potions if you had the money or determination to get lots of ingredients. Having only three potion uses for some of the longer quests and monster areas is frustrating when the game is picky about when you can meditate. Crafting and brewing is easily the best in Witcher  though. Its nice to have Witcher  style brawls back after those weird QTEs in the second game.,witcher,de89hlq,2,t5_2sebi

11037899,0,t1_dej3w9d,Try fighting a pack of wolves wild dogs especially these first two nekkers drowners etc. and tell me that they dont work together. That they dont flank you. That they dont go through irregular cycles of sometimes waiting and strafing baiting sometimes coming at you relentlessly. That when you try to attack one the others dont try to take advantage of your opening. This happens all the time.   But youre right that it doesnt always happen. There are these weird exceptions and conditions that the game places on enemies. What Im talking about is when youre actually engaged with a handful of enemies of certain common types at relatively close range. Theyll absolutely try to flank you theyll stagger their attacks when you attack one youll see that others dive in to try and hit you. But this is only when the enemies are for the lack of a better term fully aggro. If they get too far away from you they sometimes become strangely passive. They even start running away and on a related note the leash range is much too small in my opinion. Thats also usually when you see the weird taunts by human enemies in my experience. Its not necessarily the number of enemies that dictates their AI as far as I can tell but more about proximity to the player except archers obv.. You just see it much more clearly with larger groups because its more likely that some of them will end up further away.    And yes of course this is to give the player a fighting chance  if they all piled on you constantly endlessly attacking with no openings it would make the melee combat much worse as youd have no choice but to resort to cc and cheese. It wouldnt be harder not really it would just force different less interesting gameplay instead of being able to have fun fighting them with the melee systems. The way the AI is designed now is smart because it gives the player openings that they can take advantage of if they play well with quick reactions and well timed sword strikes and dodges. Funnily enough you can see some enemies just mindlessly attack constantly like Endregas and theyre much less interesting as a result  theres no way to reliably fight them with melee without resorting to a tedious waiting game since their attacks constantly overlap.           Dark Souls enemy AI is just that  mindlessly piling on you. Each enemy acts as if there are no other enemies around at all even in boss fights designed around multiple enemies. You think this is better? I disagree. The things I mentioned above should be commended as good enemy AI. Of course fighting groups in Souls is still much more interesting than in TW but thats because the enemy movesets and the general combat system are way more interesting your Quicker Combat mod seems to do some cool things to fix that btw. AIwise though Souls could absolutely take a few hints from Witcher wolves.,witcher,dej4keu,5,t5_2sebi

The guy keeps joking in literally every interview he makes but the one phrase it butthurts a bit more people will take it out of context without mercy. People literally laughed when he said that and they were mostly gamers. If it suits you is not my business. Instead of looking an automated translation from a third hand transcription of that why dont you provide people the actual video where he says that? starts at gt He literally never said a words against games? Hell he did. You just didnt heard about it. He is very salty about The Witcher games and games at all.Thats what he said against the games in that video which the article you provided refers starts at The game caused me some unnecessary and not a lot how it is in that article shit and mess. Why? Because FOREIGN PUBLISHERS and not the games started to use pictures from the games as cover arts for my books. And people shunned the books. Saying this isnt new. This is gamerelated. As if it was a book written specifically for the game. Theres a lot of such books in fantasy genre. The so called gamerelated or comicrelated books. Doesnt matter. Not original. And the fans in Europe started to reject the books. I had to do great amounts of work to prove that the books were first. Do you understand? The games caused a lot of mess. A lot of mess.Youre proving my point. Its the very same issue with his books covers that I mentioned in the first place. He says the games caused the mess but hes blaming the publishers not the games. Do you want to prove yourself non intelligent and make justice to his sarcasm?gt Also he said that the game used his popularity to become successful while the fact is there were only two of his books translated to english on The Wild Hunt release and his books got on the best sellers lists in english countries just after The Wild Hunt release.Another transcription from the video starts at Theres a rumor I dont know who spread this rumor CD Projekt Red itself I suspect. A rumor that had it not been for the games I would never get translated and published in WESTERN EUROPE not translated to English. And then he is the selfcentered one. Bull. Shit. All the translations had been created before the games. All of them. And it was the game which benefited from my popularity and not the other way around. Thats the truth.Take The Last Wish as a parameter to check where and when his books were first translated. In the Witcher Wikia page of the book it shows that it was published in Germany Spain and France before the first game and in other  Western European countries before Wild Hunt UK Italy Netherlands and Finland not to mention countries from another continents such as Brazil South Korea and China. Out. Of. Context. Imagine my shock!gt If he wasnt so ignorant he would sell the rights to the Witcher for like x times more. Instead he only earned  million while CD Projekt is now worth  billions mostly because of the game.I youre werent so ignorant you would take the huge effort of scrolling this page up and down to read other comments in this very same thread and see how he acutally ended up helping CDPR to not bankrupt and allow them to be in conditions to make two more games by not selling the rights for like x times redundant more.,witcher,df28m6m,7,t5_2sebi

11268089,0,t1_df8jwcx,You play a blank canvas in Bethesda RPGs not out of laziness but so that you can paint your own painting. I do find character driven RPGs like TW more engaging and focused but Geralt will always be Geralt no matter what choices you make. And thats great but it provides a very different experience than that of say Skyrim or New Vegas. At their core both games are roleplaying games but they are still very different. The point of modern Bethesda games was never truly to pursue the main story and be the protagonist. It is to make your own stories and be the protagonist in those smaller stories. This results in a less focused and shallower experience but gives you the tools to craft your own adventure. I do think that Skyrim receives way too much praise for what it is and is a very shallow experience BUT it is one of the few games where i can play as a blunt nord warrior making his way in this fantasy world surviving and hunting in the frozen lands of Skyrim and then come back later and play as a charismatic elven archer pursuing hisher own goals within the confines of the same universe. Modern prefallout  bethesda games are very good roleplaying games if you like making your own stories but none of the stories ive experienced in any Bethesda game have impacted like Geralts adventure and they never will. ,witcher,df97z02,6,t5_2sebi

The leftsteel sword is for human opponents while the rightsilver sword is for nonhumans opponents aka monsters if an enemys health bar is red use steel.

You know what? My elven mare we should also call somehow. Hmm...  Potka maybe?  joked the bard  Potka  agreed the witcher  its a pretty name.  Geralt?  Yes.

One of the interpretations of the ending is that its just aguaras illusion. He says everything is an illusion at the end.My take when I read it was that Geralt timetravelled or spent  years somewhere and now came back. From storytellers POV Nimue cant know too much she has to be who she is in Lady of the Lake. From Geralts perspective  he probably just doesnt want to talk about it.

In those stories women are the heros prize the warriors reward and as such they have nothing to say they can only moan and faint in the heros strong arms. I am convinced that only with contact with the other sex  whether it is because of attraction care confrontation or opposition  a hero can fully grow. When I created Yennefers character I wanted Geralt to fully grow but then I decided to make things complicated. I created a female character who refuses to be a fantasy stereotype. To please the reader.  People can make whatever criticisms of Sapkowski they want but you cannot say the man is sexist or doesnt know how to write women. The books are full of strong clearheaded and independent women who take matters into their own hands directly as regards seeing their ambitions realized. Yennefer Triss Ciri Essi Daven Mother Nenneke Philippa Eilhart Marti Sodergren Sile de Tansarville Milva ! Angouleme Cantarella Mistle and many others all fit this description. Sapkowski based the society of his world on ours from a time when things werent great for women but his characters dont just sit idly by and let things happen to them. Sapkowskis female characters are people  same as the men  who are capable of independent action in the story  same as the men.  I think that CDPR inherited this paradigm and did an admirable job staying true to the source material in this regard. This is a good succinct example of this minor spoilers for the Beauclair fist fighting quest. Geralt didnt fight a woman he didnt fight a man he fought a person  same as every other time.,witcher,dg3809u,15,t5_2sebi

11652491,0,t3_66a23q,If youre really into the story aspect I strongly recommend reading the books then playing all three games.Of course this comes down to patience and time. If like me you dont have a backlog of games to work through then there is no downside to this. Yes it means youll be involved in Witcher stuff or like a year or two but so what if its good?The books are good though unless you speak Polish youll have to read a translation but they are fine. The first couple are short stories so you can check out The Last Wish on paperback and see if you wanna go further at very little cost in time or money.You can also start the first game during the books or after youre finished even though they technically take place after the game devs made some creative choices that treat the game more like a sequel in concept than pure narrative so you can do both at the same time if you like. Or books then games doesnt matter.The combat mechanics of the first game are.... controversial at best. If you care about story though you can cheat. Heres how I played with a controller and mods because I hate the combat but love the world and storyWitcher  is an amazing game but it benefits that much more if you catch the little references and character building that would come from the books and previous games. More importantly the books and games are great on their own so its not like youd be doing a bunch of homework to prepare for W. The books are lovely individual stories set in a fascinating world followed by a multilevel epic novel series. The first game is quirky darkfantasy conspiracy story and the second game is a complex medieval political narrative.,witcher,dggtomn,1,t5_2sebi
11654830,0,t1_dgguxm6,I have no idea how English translation is but Polish books are great.

11765217,0,t1_dgtkkut,agreed. Having only played the first couple hours of the witcher  and completed the rd I always felt there was something awkward about Trisss relationship with pretty much everyone outside of the lodge. Finishing the lady of the lake last night confirmed it for me  she is a massive third wheel in the relationships between Geralt Yen and Ciri. Its not as prevalent in the games as it is in the books but she kept trying to position herself as a lover to Geralt and a sister to Ciri while actively trying to push Yen out of the way which just came off as super awkward to me.Folks on Team Triss argue the relationship between Geralt and Yen isnt genuine because it is based upon a wish which is true but I argue at least it makes the dynamics with Ciri make some sense compared to Triss. Yen frequently refers to herself as Ciris mother in the books which makes sense in the context of taking care of her. Triss meanwhile calls her little sis while actively trying to get Geralts pants off. ,witcher,dgtm8gd,15,t5_2sebi
