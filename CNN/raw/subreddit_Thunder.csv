I like how they constantly deflect the most valid criticism of their team their average age and athletic ability. The Spurs fanbase always seemed chill but I guess when you dont get salty for  games it builds up or something....But the whole of rnba wont let you say shit about the Spurs actually being old. While they beat the majority of the league it seems pretty damn obvious to me that they arent athletic enough to keep up with the Thunder. Watch Tim Duncan Tony Parker or Manu Ginobili highlights. Yeah theyve aged well but theyve aged. They clearly arent the players they once were. I honestly believe the Spurs got a free pass last year once Russ went out. And I still believe they should have beat the Heat. Edit Ill also add that Ive yet to see one single Spurs fan mention that Parkers line for this game was ...,Thunder,cgjqus0,4,t5_2s53c

2693716,0,t3_2quzuu,I dont hate Ish Smith at all but the critics of him are absolutely justified. For one yes he is more consistent. But a consistent  for  for  points  rebounds and  assist player is not as valuable as an inconsistent player who still averages more that all of that. Lamb on his worst night still equals Smith on an average night. And that includes defense. Theres just no upside to Smith. More importantly Ish doesnt fit in with our team. We already have two slashing ball hog PGs who are very good purespot up shooters. And we never play Ish without one of them. Which either for we Ish into a shooting roll which he is terrible at or it makes it so that Russ or Reg turn into spot up shooters and both are a million times better off the dribble. ,Thunder,cna6rsf,-2,t5_2s53c

2775618,0,t3_2rus00,The thunder have always been one of the worst teams at defending the three even with some of the more imposing wing defenders. I have two theories behind this. we let teams have the three. With serge and steven roaming the paint and andre and russell focusing on stealing the ball and taking risks we as a team will let teams have open threes if were able to take away all the easier buckets. this is the one I cant prove but I firmly believe. I think teams just show up against us. Ive watched basketball most of my life and I think that when teams play the thunder whether it be the warriors or the magic they want to beat us a little more than they want to beat other teams. I like to think this is because other players view this as a chance to beat two of the best players on the planet. Like when we played against the suns one of the Morris twins just went in for like  straight points four threes I think making obnoxiously difficult shots all because he was fired up to play against US. I bet good money he hasnt as a hot spurt like that the whole rest of the season.I hope that doesnt sound weird its just an observation either way we need to figure it out before the playoffs start or we could get housed by the rockets or the warriors.Edit spelling,Thunder,cnjkt11,2,t5_2s53c

2851537,0,t1_cns0kfi,That is exactly it. Last night was so frustrating to watch. Everytime he would get the ball he would ask for a PnR then either drive to the rim taking a contested shot or bricking a long range shot.

4307276,0,t3_3abj01,Roberson was . from  and . from the line last season. He averaged . points and . minutes per game. Hes a few years from being suitable for starter level minutes IMO. The good news is Roberson is putting in the work  to get there  shots a day on top of other work. I just dont think next year will be Robersons breakout year. If he is shooting poorly on just a couple attempts per game he will absolutely kill spacing which is bad news for a slasher like Russel. Morrow is great on catch and shoot. He makes a lot of sense with Russ out there but he is the type of guy you hide on D. There is also the question of how much Morrow would be used as a starter. While Morrow works well to space the floor for Russ OKC has too many high usage players starting with Russ being the highest to maximize Morrows strength as a shooter and minimize his weaknesses on D. I think Morrow is a better choice than Roberson but including him would necessitate some changes in how much the other starters shoot the ball. Waiters is a possibility. The problem here isnt that Waiters isnt a good defender its that he is a bit small for a  guard. At  with a  wingspan Waiters is only slightly larger than Russ and could struggle to contest the shots of taller longer guards like Klay Thompson  with a  wingspan. Waiters size also limits him being able to switch on defense. Lastly Waiters likes to play with the ball in his hands more than he would be allowed as a starter. I think the team picked him up to be a th man and that is the role I think he is best suited to. Waiters struggles with inefficiency might be minimized if he moved to the starting lineup and took fewer shots but Im not sure how happy he would be about having his touches reduced. Dion likes his buckets.Lamb is the last choice though he might be gone by the start of next season. He has good height and length but at lbs would be a target to get posted up by heavier stronger guards. He is likewise limited in his ability to switch onto larger defenders. Like Dion Lamb is more of a ball dominant guard who fits better as a th man for this team. He isnt great at catch and shoot either.I dont think there is a clear choice at this moment and the team hasnt telegraphed their intentions. Personally I think Roberson starts in the preseason and gets a chance. I see Morrow in the starting spot for most of the season though. Maybe Presti will surprise us and trade for or even draft someone who is a better fit.     ,Thunder,csb5m1h,5,t5_2s53c

4913369,0,t3_3i3srh,I dont think starting Roberson and Adams together is a good idea and I also dont think its smart to start Morrow and Kanter together. Id say of those four guys its most likely that Kanter starts because of his contract and with my way of looking at it Roberson would be still starting at the two which gives KD amp Russ some relief defensively. Its been said so many times I hate to beat a dead horse but it for sure matters a lot more with who ends games and not who starts. I think our squad to close games will vary on the match up and if Steven Adams cant shoot a better percentage from the free throw line itll probably be Serge closing games at the five for the most part unless were going against a team that has no interior threat and then we can use Kanter in that late game scenario.,Thunder,cudv7li,3,t5_2s53c

6680265,0,t1_d09gjaf,It depends man if we knew we werent getting him back then absolutely trade him. While his offense has regressed I think hes still a great defender. I would strongly consider it if we were getting a great player on both sides of the court preferably someone with smothering defense. However our problem is that we wouldnt really have anyone to fill that power forward spot and tbh KDs talent would be wasted there. Thats the biggest concern if you play Kanter then youre gambling that hell be a decent enough defender every night or else youre fucked. It would also mess up the defense on at least one lineup because what do you do when Adams is out? You wouldnt have a single good defensive big man.

Brooks would be very stubborn with his lineups and strategy. Sticking with Perkins against the Heat may have cost us a title. BD has been much more flexible. If something hasnt worked he has made the right adjustment or at least tried something else. Example He stuck with Singler all season saw it wasnt working in the playoffs and shifted the rotations.I also think KD and Russ are  behind his decisions now which wasnt the case after the allstar break.,Thunder,d3fwqdt,21,t5_2s53c

8601058,0,t1_d6glo4m,I want you to read what you typed then read what I typed then tell me who seems salty. Ill bite though. You sure theyre okay with it? How about when both Draymond amp Klay said they dont need KD there. The team is fine as it is. Sure theyll be able to keep Curry Klay amp Draymond but theres no way in hell theyll be able to give KD a max contract and still build great depth behind the starters. Dont forget that injuries do happen. KD had the same injury that ended Yao Mings career. Dont forget about Currys ankle problems. Depth is very important. I dont care who the starters are. If you dont have capable back ups youll fail. This was a bad decision by GS front office. They didnt think about the future. Since you wanna talk about systems lets talk about them. Ill admit there are times when RussKD went hero ball mode. Look at the reason why though. Our starting lineup was RussRobersonKDIbakaAdams.  of our  starters are defensive minded amp dont have a consistent shot. Look at who we had on our bench. Not many scoring options. Look at our roster last season amp you tell me who you would want to take the clutch time shots. If you say anyone other than Russ or KD youre a damn fool.GS system isnt as great as people make it out to be. Its the players more than its the system. They have the  best  point shooters on the same team. Everyone else does screens. WHOA! amazing system! All they do is put up crazy shots that any other coach would curse them out for doing. Look at how terrible they looked when Curry amp Klays shots werent dropping. Im not taking anything away from them when it comes to shooting. I respect Klay Thompson.Next season theyll have a hole at Center. If you think theyll be able to keep Zaza Pachulia for .m a year youre trippin. Cant count on Varejao all he does is flop amp get injured. JaVale McGee? Really? David West? His best days are way behind him. I wouldnt be surprised if he retires after this season.Livingston amp Iguodala will be free agents after this season. Theyre gonna demand some decent money. Only way theyll be able to keep them is if KD doesnt resign. Even then someone might give them an amazing offer they cant refuse. Let this sink. Harrison Barnes got a max contract. These teams are throwing out crazy numbers to these players. So dont think people will take  less to stay with GS. Will you still be a fan when things go bad? This is a serious boom amp bust year for GS. Im saying GS instead of yall because I know youre a bandwagon fan. How can I tell? The way youre acting. You must be really trying to convince yourself that youre a real fan by coming here. Were excited about how our team looks. Theres nothing you can say to bring us down. And Russell Westbrook was always our best player you dumb fuck.,Thunder,d6gq4xu,7,t5_2s53c

Im saying that the fact that we had enough cap space to both retain KD and make an offer to Horford could only have happened this year. Sure once teams were aware of the cap increase they could plan on it but it threw plans theyd already made into disarray. These guys plan their stuff out  years in advance. In most years only a few teams could offer a max contract slot. This year nearly everyone could. That alone makes it different.And the concept of theres more cap space so its less valuable is not hard to understand. As I said before its literally supply and demand.

But there are other ways to open up lanes like cutting and using bigs to facilitate Like Sabonis and Adams can do.But thats easier said than done when our scoring is limited like it is. No excuses for how BD gets this team to defend though. We may not have the kind of team that can shoot but we have a list that in theory can sure as shit defend. That could be our identity make it a low scoring game and see what happens from there. Instead our guys just watch as the opposition scores.,Thunder,da0pmy2,2,t5_2s53c

If Presti was making moves assuming Durant was leaving that would have influenced Durants decision to leave. In hindsight it wouldnt have mattered but it was the right decision at the time. Anderson and Gordon dont move the needle for us enough anyway. Id rather have a  year old Sabonis for  mil a year than a  year old Anderson for  mil a year.

11211056,0,t1_df2pcch,A simple google search can show you what sing and trade is. In summary. kings didnt do that because a player would only agree to such an agreement if they trade him to a team he wanted and that team agrees to pay that extra salary compared to what they can offer lower to a free agent. If cousins dint want to go to NO kings cannot force him to. Then cousins might not renew his contract with Kings and go to team of his choice.Edit It doesnt happen very often because the third team that gets the player benefits the least from such an agreement so they do not regularly agree for such an agreement. Player gets an higher salary old tam gets compensated for a player that they would normally lose imagine what we might have got for KD is he agreed to this but the team that gets the player pays extra for the salary and trade players for a guy that they can sign as a free agent. This mostly happens if a team wants to dump of some salary and wants not to risk the guy changing his mind and signing with another team in FA.In the National Basketball Association a signandtrade agreement is a type of contract allowed by the collective bargaining agreement CBA wherein one franchiseteam signs an unrestricted free agent player to a new contract only to then immediately trade him to another team of the players choosing. This is typically done to enable the player to obtain a higher salary andor greater number of years on their contract than NBA salary cap rules ordinarily allow the destination team itself to provide the player.What is Sign and Trade Agreements?A sign and trade agreement is a trade made in the NBA in which a potential freeagent is signed by their team and then immediately traded to another team.  This structure exists because a free agents team would be left without any compensation if their free agent signs with another team.This is from sporting chartsSporting Charts explains Sign and Trade AgreementsA player may want a signandtrade because it allows the player to get a bigger salary for more years than if they just signed with another team.  Again this is the result of the NBAs CBA which allows teams to resign their own free agents for longer and for more money than other teams.  This rule is designed to allow teams to have an advantage when trying to resign their own free agents.  The teams seeking to sign such a player will benefit by getting the player of their choice while the players original team gains something in return for their free agent.  A team agreeing to a signandtrade may not renege on the agreement and keep the signed player they must trade him.,Thunder,df2rdy1,2,t5_2s53c
