So basically what they do is the lock out all customization because as always they can be used to give players in some form or fashion an edge on the rest.

1721547,0,t3_2e507d,Agree with others on playing GO instead of CSS.  Are you new to shooters or just new to CS?  There is a steep learning curve in many shooters and CS is no exception.  The best thing you can do is just play but there is also a ton you can learn by reading and watching others play.  Read articles about maps and breakdowns of pro matches spectate the people who kill you and watch streamerstournaments.You also need to familiarize yourself with how the game actually runs.  Look into config files and how you can tweak settings to optimize the game.  This may sound trivial since youre totally new but it is very important.  Better to get good playing under one set of conditions than changing things up sometime down the line.  As far as your actual question about game modes I think GO is pretty straight forward about that.  People generally play either open pubs where things are somewhat relaxed and you can feel free to do whatever or they play vs where things are a bit more serious and you should have some idea of what you should be doing.,counterstrike,cjw5xxv,2,t5_2r5c3

Or there is typo in the config name esp. if someone has hidden file extensions... file being userconfig.txt or userconfig.cfg.txt or some nonsense for Windows or in manual command in console.Readonly would just prevent editing so nothing could be changed in the config file until its set back to normal. Its not good idea to do for config.cfg and it also prevents userconfig and autoexec to make alterations to it. Its fine for the other ones userconfig autoexec or any other custom config if youre not going to updatechange them anytime soon.I wonder if you can execute the config with launch options exec userconfig.cfgzoomsensitivityratio doesnt show in config.cfg if its on default value and that is normal as far as I know.
