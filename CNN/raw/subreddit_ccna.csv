There is absolutely no reason you cant take the CCNA and pass it and spend the next  years studying for one of the CCNP exams while gaining on the job experience.  Passing any P level exam renews all P and below certs.The reality of things are that you will need to work an entry level job for a few years to go anywhere.  You can have all the certs and degrees you want no one is hiring a senior level engineer with a CCNP requirement who has no experience.Your first helpdesk job is going to be a miserable customer service experience.  Youll get to spend all day helping people reboot modems or click the sendreceive button in their mail client.  You will hate it.  It will give you the foundation of moving up to some type of network monitoring  NOC type of position.  After a few years of monitoring things that other people have built youll start getting opportunities to help build small portions of things and grow from there until you are the guy designing the entire network.If you currently have no network experience you should really expect to spend the next  years doing grunt work.  Just about everyone has done it and it doesnt somehow make you lesser it is just how you grow up in the IT world.,ccna,ci5myqs,0,t5_2qjhh

The router then figures out which networks those interfaces lead to. In a way it would be simpler if the network statement was used this wayRouterconfigrouter network interface fa area xBut thats not how it works. So in your example using the following satementRouterconfigrouter network ... ... area xThats fine it will work with your interface but if one day you configure a new interface with an address in the subnet ...X keep in mind that it WILL be included in your OSPF network.

I hope this doesnt get downvoted because I am not trying to be a troll.I know.  The exams hard probably hardest style Ive ever seen.  I know the stuff but the SIMs are harder than in realworld or even other simulators due to their limit in scope.  The no points given if you miss  on a multiple choice answer is hard as well.

Most of the time I see them they are being used as just an inverted netmask which makes them pretty easy to mentally convert back to the netmask.Sometimes I use them in IOS to match specific noncontiguous networks which is an easier example to do mentally. Like if I had   sites all with a voice subnet at .x.. its easy to divvy up the octets as Care.DontCare.Care.DontCare so ... or .... Then my ACL only would need permit ip SOURCE ... ....  To do that on an ASA would require either an ACL with  lines or building an objectgroup with  networks.Some of the tricks like build a wildcard to match only evennumbered subnet is not something Id ever see doing in production but is more just to reinforce the binary behind it.,ccna,cserjlm,1,t5_2qjhh

5480671,0,t1_cwaji6i,Ive been thinking about this post a lot. I finally got a chance to glance at the new OCG for new security level. It certainly calls out CCP which I found odd. Then I remembered something from my IAUWS CCNP wireless studies. During that study time the recommendation is to use the GUI front end of autonomous APs to write AAA statements. AAPs run IOS so one could enter the commands via command line. However we were told to use the GUI unless we had expertise with AAA command line. Its too easy to make mistakes and even lock yourself out. At the CCNA level you arent expected to write full AAA commands for site to site or anything else. Unless something has changed. Even in route switch its not until CCNP where you even learn the aaa commands for setting up a default method list or a local fallback. I think the GUI is there to help people learn the commands. Aaa is brutal in that the commands are longer than the screen and they have to be spot on. Just my thoughts. ,ccna,cwc7gq0,1,t5_2qjhh

6198373,0,t3_40hj8d,gtSo this is my question is CCNA just a big joke on its own?CCNA is the de facto expected  starting point for a junior. No employer is going to be blown away by the fact you have a CCNA but not having one is even more of a uphill battle. Also keep in mind your applying for junior positions no one is expecting a junior to have  certs unless your going for a SMB sole IT guy job...in which case dont do that.gt years experience with stuffJob descriptions are nothing more than a companys best case scenario wish list. A secret most juniors dont realize is that most people will not meet those requirements and arent really expected to either.You can still apply for a job that says  years experience it is up the company to say your whether or not your good enough for an interview. Though keep things in reason if they are asking for a CCIE then dont bother if your not a senior. Ever wonder ISP NOCs put things like SONET or CMTS in the experience section? So they can easily drop candidates they dont want without any fuss. Hell I worked for a place that would give a damn near impossible test on obscure things just so we could tell people we dont want sorry you failed the test. gtIs MCSE the next logical step?This always annoys me whenever I see it. MCSE is meant to be a intermediatesenior cert. Just like the CCNP it can hurt a junior more than help. Plus it is not a particularly easy  exams. Now if your interested in the infrastructure side of things you can always go through the learning in fact I always tell people a good Network EngineerArchitect should have a pretty good understanding of the microsoft and linux side of things. But I would keep actual certs at a MCPMCSA level. Besides a NOC isnt going to care at all that you have nonnetworking certs unless they happen to have a special project that might use the skills. But they might write you off as a sysadmin and throw your resume away.Anyway to get a job make a linkedin profile and start connecting with everyone you can send out your resume to the job and recruiter sites go to job fairs and generally just get your name out there.,ccna,cyu6t1y,11,t5_2qjhh
6205722,0,t3_3zd0bo,Hi. I took icnd now im preparing for icnd.My reasons I had no experience with cisco before Just wanted to try out was expecting to get  from my employer for icnd etc. icnd  CCENT had not so much  so had to pass from the first time. Ive expected  exam path to be easier English is not my mother tongueExam was not hard for me but ive learnt material quite well no braindumps i just love learning and i like to understand how it works.If you would take  exam path please have in mind that those exams should not be far apart. I mean dont wait too much before taking the second one.My choice paid off for me because ive got CCENT and then ive moved to the other job. Im working with cisco equipment now and moving towards ccnp.If ive had more money and some experience at a time i guess i would have taken composite exam. If youll be using all materials available and money is not an issue maybe you should consider composite. Its up to you.,ccna,cyv0w3h,1,t5_2qjhh

If the official courses were reasonably priced Id love to take them and Im sure others in all these Cisco subreddits would agree. I can understand why youd be amused I can agree with you that the fact that a book exists at all is somewhat of a blessing given that Cisco is seemingly assuming that people are supposed to just take these higher level or specialized track exams without any sanctioned guidance on their product. Its no wonder why people go the Juniper route when they offer their exam guides for free at least to my knowledge. I still think excellent is a stretch but I will agree that at least an OCG has been published.

6854279,0,t3_49mwkc,OP I highly suggest you take this job.  You may not like it right now but it might serve you better in the long run.gt I have my CCNA cert but I cant apply for any network jobs because I have no experience whatsoever.I was in the same boat you were when I started my career.  I was in one of the first classes through our local Cisco Academy at the local junior college back in the early s. The material was new to the teachers the teachers were new I didnt feel confident in my ability to sit the cert test so I thought I would self study for a bit and then try. Life distracted me.  Three years later Id had enough of my barelyhigherthanminimum wage job so I went back to the training center and asked if I could audit a course over the summer to help me get back up to speed.  The director advised me they had added classes through the CCNP level and turned it into a twoyear degree program ... which was even better because Id get a degree to boot.So I signed up got my aid took my classes. The electives included prep for the A and some basic Microsoft certs.  At this time the Microsoft certs were getting a really bad rap in the IT press because the market was being flooded by people with certs who didnt really know their jobs.  BTW it was as a partial response to this that Cisco decided to make their tests as tough as they are.  They want to weed out as many people as they can and that makes your cert more valuable.  So I got my A skipped the MS certs I didnt really like desktop support anyway and then passed my CCNA.Then I discovered Id put the cart before the horse that the natural progression for someone in the IT world is A PC repair MCPMCSE desktopserver support and then CCNA.I started looking for jobs and eventually did land one with a local ISP for an entry level position but what I realized was that Id restricted myself to only working for large companies with  employees or more. Its not until theyre that size that they have enough networking work to employ someone to do nothing but networking work.  Below  theyre looking for someone who can do  PC repair  server support and about  networking.  Thats not to say I cant do PC repair or server support  Ive been playing with computers since the mid s  but I have nothing on my resume to show for it.Im now  years into the career have plenty of Network Engineer experience and in both pay and political sense it would be a huge step backwards to take a desktopserver support role at a smaller organization.  So Im still restricted to working for large companies. Statistics show that the  of smallmediumlarge companies in a geographic area is pretty steady. So the only way to increase the number of opportunities would be to move to a larger metropolitan area ... which I cant do right now.You may be luckier than I.  You may be able to get into this job do some desktopserver support for a year or so and have that on your resume in addition to having a CCNA and that may open more doors for you down the road.While Im at it another piece of advice learned from my own errors If you ever think about moving up to CCNP to keep your CCNA active ... maybe dont go straight for the CCNP.  Get some of the other CCNAs first.  In my case I went with CCNA Routing and Switching then got my CCNP RampS.  Im not feeling up to the CCIE yet so Im thinking about getting some of the other CCNPs first.  Well ... a CCNA does not recertify a CCNP.  So if I want to get CCNP Service Provider I have to pass the CCNA SP as well as the CCNP SP tests to recertify my current CCNP.What I shouldve done is gotten my CCNA RampS then CCNA SP which would recertify my CCNA RampS then CCNP RampS then CCNP SP and be able to do it with one less test since Id already taken the CCNA SP.,ccna,d0t8oc5,2,t5_2qjhh

If you are looking at those  VLAN s as separate locations then they will either need  separate subnets or be NATd. Note that they can still be VLAN  at each location because that is only significant at that location. In production environments if you are designing this as  separate branches you would absolutely make these different subnets. BUT you may actually run into a scenario where you have two branches with the same LAN subnet and the only way for them to communicate would be to NAT between them i.e. your accompany just acquired another company and the new company happened to use the same subnet.

There is also some situations where if you have a limited license youll only be able to enable stub routing.In OSPF stubs remove either external routes andor interarea routes and tends to replace them with a default route. The general idea is that if you have  routes in your routing table the branch doesnt necessarily need that level of detail and if it is a smaller Cisco  or such then it may not do well with a ton of routes.In EIGRP stubs work similar but its main goal is to optimize the EIGRP network by stopping the branch for being queried when the hub has a route become active so the route doesnt become stuck in active as the hub asks all the branches that probably dont have the route anyway.BGP does technically have a stub mode but it only exists on the FWSM module.,ccna,dcgn37d,13,t5_2qjhh

11448506,0,t3_62bvey,. I prefer Cisco Press.. My opinion is heavily biased since I wrote much of Bosons ICNDCCNA exams.. Its entirely up to you as to whether you should do the oneexam or twoexam option. With the two separate exams youre not studying as much all at once but if you have any weaknesses you wont be able to hide them as easily. With the single CCNA exam theres a lot of material all at once but if you have a weakness the exam is so broad that you arent likely to be drilled to death on any single topic.. You can take ICND anytime after taking ICND but dont dawdle and wait years. No you cannot go back and review answers.. Yes you can use virtual labs.Also it is ICND not ICDN. ,ccna,dftofly,1,t5_2qjhh

11624015,0,t3_65tpt3,Congrats!Coming up with a bunch of multiple choice questions isnt the problem. Coming up with detailed and accurate explanations is the problem... as well as coming up with different simulations and simlets. For every  multiple choice questions we write we have to craft those simlets and sims too  enough to flesh out a full exam. Those take time to craft and my time costs money which would mean Boson would have to increase prices. So the goal is to give you good value for your money  helping you pass as efficiently as possible for a reasonable price.Theres also plenty of stuff we could add like the random stuff you found while studying. But were not going to add things just for the sake of adding things that arent directly going to help you pass the exam. What you need to pass is in the product  if not in the questions then in the explanations. We cover a lot of valuable content in our explanations.Still if you found something in the exam not just in your general studies that we dont cover please let us know being sure to stay within the NDA boundaries. We will be happy to add whatever needs to be added!Again congrats. ,ccna,dgdldpy,3,t5_2qjhh
