9554232,0,t3_5bre4c,Id say the thing I like most about blue spotted tail is just humbly and quietly Robin sings it. The earnestness and almost weariness make it so much more relatable for me. And the delicate guitar coupled with his sweet singing make the song imoI listened to HB a couple days ago and coincidentally was thinking side D Shrine Blue spotted tail grown ocean was one of my favorite sides of all time up there with side D of illinoise if youre wondering lol.,fleet_foxes,d9qr8et,10,t5_3gbou

11222861,0,t3_5zlz1d,I remember people talking about how the first song on the new album should open with the wind chimes that end Grown Ocean. Would be cool but maybe a bit too much. Would make more sense if the albums were conceptually connected.,fleet_foxes,df43iop,1,t5_3gbou

11695284,0,t1_dgln8mo,I do recall! I videoed the first and last song he played in Brussels uploaded on YouTube but not the second song. In Groningen I didnt make any video but audio recorded the entire concert. Thanks to you I now have the title of the second song he played. Im now only still missing the title of the fourth song he played. The other titles I have figured out.After the concert in Groningen RP told me he wasnt sure all the songs he played would make it on the record. It appears that almost all of them will be on the record except maybe the fourth song he played.Cant wait to hear the whole album!,fleet_foxes,dglog3y,2,t5_3gbou
