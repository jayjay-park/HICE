43585,0,t1_cejd00u,To put it simplyDeadpool being a character that is generally accepted to be suffering from a number of serious mental issues as well as being capable of breaking the fourth wall it would make sense that he would also be capable of holding a conversation with the voices in his head.The yellow dialog box is intended to serve as Deadpools internal monologue the same as any other comic character like Batman or SpiderMan.However once Way introduced the second white dialog box as a more crazed alternative inner voice the yellow dialog box often served as the voice of reason.Both were really just different aspects of Wades personality similar to the classic angeldevil on the shoulder cliche.All that said a running gag is that at least on occasion when it seems as if Wade is simply holding a conversation in his headno different than Spidey or any other characterhe is actually speaking to himself out loud.

On the other hand there are things that are always still in the air changing adding or cutting see what happened to Rouge for DoFP and then there is the studio instructions if they feel introducing Pym or even Lang in Avengers  there is a high probability that Whedon will say yes even if it was out of his original vision.,Marvel,cep2zhs,1,t5_2r40o

Theres just no way they dont.  That being said the win that matters far more is quality. Ive got low expectations but am hoping to be very surprised by Batman vs. Supermans quality but we already know Marvel can do quality. Unless they make some major mistake which they wont theyve gotta be pulling out all the stops if theyre gonna make this a big competition Im pretty confident in guessing that whatever Marvel puts out on that date will be the better movie regardless of whether or not it makes more money and as long as the movie is good Marvel will come out  the other end doing just fine. ,Marvel,cf9g8e5,2,t5_2r40o

If they dont fit the story then they dont appear its as simple as that. A Spidey story is a Spidey story and XMen story is an XMen story to have the Avengers show up to save the day wouldnt really make sense. Hell most of the problems the XMen have the Avengers could either solve with ease or its a purely mutant issue. Case in point theres an issue where SpiderMan encounters the XMen and he spends a couple of pages soloing a few members of the team with relative ease and he admits to holding back during the fight. Might be his first meeting with them dont remember. Point is SpiderMan is not a particularly powerful character but  most of the core XMen wouldnt last five minutes in a fight with him if he went all out. Only Colossus Wolverine and Iceman could take him out and even then its likely he would out think Colossus and Wolverine and wind up defeating them. If you insert a team of characters with such capabilities into any storyline of a different franchise they would finish it off lickety split.

He leaves due to a war his people are fighting.      months later Peter is born.   Some aliens come looking for him because to end the spartax bloodline.   They kill his mom but Peter kills the aliens.   He then goes from foster house to foster house and eventually ends up an astronaut.  Which is how he gets to space.

464704,0,t1_ceuujml,But dont we love the stories of supers because they ARE merely human at the core with all their flaws? Most of the mutants or supers werent raised in an environment where they were told they were special from the word goin most cases they learned about their abilities later and they shaped their personas as normal people but i can fire lazors from my face rather than I am a superior entity. In short compare Superman raised by humans taught to treat everyone fairly to other Kryptonians. Superman is extremely human they are extremely alien. Few mutant people in the MU were raised into the belief that they were superior or even different. most didnt even know. So I feel most mutants really are just like us. The ones that consider themselves superior act pretty much like supremacy groups from the real world firebombing churches lynching people running amok and instilling fear in those they consider to be inferior. the others just try to live their lives their egos tempered by the fact that theyre institutionally hated and have been raised in a culture that taught them they are untrustworthy. ,Marvel,cft36rv,1,t5_2r40o

This was patented as  StarkChobham armor.He also had S.K.I.N SynthKinetic Interface Nanofluid armor which is a lightweight liquid armor with immense structural integrity being harder than titanium and approaching lowgrade adamantium.And as people have already mentioned Iron Destroyer is a suit forged out of Uru and endowed with magic from Odin.

It affects every woman he interacts with in real life and every woman he may interact with in the future. Because even if you have trouble believing his speech affects women who read it on three internet his unchecked behavior WILL affect how he treats women in real life. There only thing you can do to improve such behavior is point it out how others do as well and how it has some cumulative impact which causes him to reconsider his attitude. ,Marvel,cgkf5ny,1,t5_2r40o

770548,0,t1_cgruxob,perhaps likable was the wrong word. The Tony Stark they have created in the MCU would not make the same decisions as the one in the comics. He seems very untrusting of SHIELD with apparently good reason. Do not see his character as it stands now to back registration. Also as it stands there is no real force that could force the registration. I think they could still do a Civil War story line but I think it would be drastically different then what was in the comics. Much smaller scale perhaps more government vs super heroes than super heroes vs super heroes. Some super heroes will obviously have to choose the governments side but dont think well get Iron Man vs Cap anytime in the near future.  ,Marvel,cgrv6gw,6,t5_2r40o

If the reason the variants sell for so much is supply and demand it is the same case as the Nintendo Wii. Demand was high supply was low. GameStop Walmart Target all sold it for the suggested price. People on eBay or Craigslist were the ones selling Wiis for . Most people hated it. It comes off to me like these comic store are the middle men who are using their stores as a physical CL. Do comics stores have to pay more to their distributor these rarier comics? Im just trying to find out why it is an acceptable common practice for place to charge so much more for a brand new item that has a suggested new price.

1025405,0,t1_chk03ik,Ultimate Marvel is still worth reading despite some of the worse writing. Its not much different than  Marvel in that respect actually. I think the main thing is that  can buffer out the bad stories with sheer numbers whereas Ultimate has only ever had up to  different series ongoing at the same time. Thus a bad story is made very noticeable. Ultimate Spiderman is consistently the best Ultimate Marvel has to offer and its honestly very good outside of that fact. The Ultimates series have been hitormiss but Ive always appreciated how brutal it can be in tone especially when compared to most Marvel stories. When someone dies they die and its going to be horrible to watch. Ultimate Fantastic Four is also a bit hit or miss but I really like what they did with a certain character in the end of its run. And finally Ultimate Xmen is also hit or miss with the newer version of its comic Ultimate Comics Ultimate Xmen being much better imo. As for the newer Ultimate Marvel stories they just relaunched three new series Miles Morales Ultimate Spiderman AllNew Ultimates and Ultimate FF. All you really need to read to understand those is maybe the Cataclysm event which served to shake things up for the Ultimate universe i.e. Kitty Pryde boxing with Galactus. ,Marvel,chkufgd,1,t5_2r40o

1042309,0,t1_chmpa6b,This is the correct answer although I dont think theres a correct way to do a deadpool movie anyway. First of all hes too corny to appeal to the middleaged folks with money. Secondly hes too vulgar for a lot of the younger crowd lt  that would appreciate his dickjokes although Im  and still laugh at them. Lastly and most importantly he doesnt have a marquee villian to go up against. Deadpool floats around between the avengers the xmen and others and either joins in their battles or fights the goodguys himself. If you do a Deadpool movie youll just end up with a watereddown Wade Wilson backstory with some cheesy liners fighting against Norman Osborns dark avengers or something. For that you might as well watch the Amazing SpiderMan movies.I say all of this as a big fan of Deadpool.,Marvel,chmrjwq,1,t5_2r40o

He used the square shaped one for a while then went back to the hammeraxe thing.In the Ultimate Marvel imprint title The Ultimates and its sequel The Ultimates  the Ultimate version of Thor wields a Mjolnir styled after a classical war hammer. It is not magical in origin but rather an advanced technological marvel designed by the European Union Super Soldier Program to mimic Thors powers. At the end of The Ultimates  Thor proves his divinity and reclaims his Asgardian powers to defeat Loki. In The Ultimates  Who Killed The Scarlet Witch Thor wields a hammer more closely resembling the mainstream Marvel Universe Mjolnir. In one scene where he is entering a secured building the computer controlling access identifies first Thor then Mjolnir this leads another character to question why the computer identified Mjolnir as a separate sentient organism but Thor does not give an explanation for this. He later displays a wall of weapons including both hammers which he states were gifts from his father forged by Ulik the Troll. However in the prequel miniseries Ultimate Comics Thor it is revealed that the original hammer is not the real Mjolnir but instead Dr. Braddock gives Thor techarmor and Thor suggests to turn the power supply into a hammer. It is believed that both versions of the hammer is not restricted by the worthiness test. In Ultimate Comics The Ultimates Thor puts his hammer inside the Room With No Doors with his son Modi so that he may escape the destruction and genocide of the Asgardians. With Thor being the last Asgardian alive and his hammer is gone he loses his divine powers and becomes mortal. Tony Stark kept Thors tech armor and hammer since Thor no longer felt he had use for it and gives it to Thor to restore his powers because he feels the world needs a god of thunder.That said Im not  sure your pics are from ultimate Im guessing from Thors beard and the lower case print.

1390526,0,t3_2a1gng,Schism is a good place to start in order to understand why there is a division in the Xmen between Cyclops group and Wolverines. Basically after the mutant decimation Cyclops begins to feel that mutants are next to extinction and that he must take whatever measures necessary to protect the remaining mutants. Wolverine finds this to be extreme and wants something closer to Xaviers dream where mutant children can have a chance at having a proper childhood instead of being raised into soldiers. Great read awesome art epic fight at the end. Avengers vs Xmen comes along a little but later and expands on this schism. The Phoenix force is coming back to Earth and Cyclops believes that as the cosmic entity for rebirth it is the key to jump starting the mutant race. I liked this series and it leads directly into where all the Marvel Now Xmen titles begin. Im not sure how far youve read into AvX but it causes some big changes towards the end.Marvel NowUncanny Xmen Follows Cyclops and his group of fugitive Xmen as they hide from SHIELD while starting their own school The New Charles Xavier School for Mutants and do whatever it takes to protect the new mutants that are starting to spring up. Notable XMen in this series include Cyclops Magneto Magik and Emma Frost.Wolverine and the Xmen Focuses more on the students and staff of Wolverines school the Jean Grey School For Higher Learning jeangreyschool.com. Notable XMen staff include Wolverine Iceman Rachel Grey Kitty Pryde Beast Angel and Storm. Also has a handful of mutant students such a Quentin Quire and Kid Apocalypse.All New Xmen Beast fears that Cyclops is slipping too far and might soon start a revolutionary war. To prevent this he goes back in time and returns with the original five teenage XMen Jean Scott Bobby Hank and Warren. Kitty Pryde helps lead this timedisplaced group as they try and deal with this futuristic experience.  They also bounce around between schools so it helps tie together Uncanny XMen and WATX.Xmen Focuses on an all female cast of XMen Faculty from the Jean Grey School. Notable XMen include Storm Jubilee Psylocke Rachel Rogue etc.Amazing XMen This one focus more on the general staff of the Jean Grey School as they do more traditional XMen adventures. Wolverine Beast Iceman Storm Nightcrawler and more.Uncanny Avengers A mix of Mutants and Avengers working together to try and heal the rift caused by the events of AvX. Notable mutants involve Rogue Havok and the Scarlett Witch. Wolverine appears often as well like always. I cant say Im big on the roster but the story lines have been pretty epic.

1433234,0,t3_2ak309,No need to start at  nor is there a need to read everything because that would both be expensive and massively time consuming.. Check the sidebar. There should be a few quickstart guides there.. If there is a characterteam you like find a comic shop near you and talk to the staff directly about where to start. They will be able to hook you up with a great starting point faster than we can. If that is not an option look for collected trades with the charactersteam you are interested in. These books have  issues of a complete storyline typically and are usually a great place to start.. This is important to remember. You will almost never have to start at  of volume  especially with the Marvel books. Recently Marvel has gotten really good at marking books as the start of a new storyline on the cover or on the first recap page.

1609853,0,t1_cjhqrna,It seems like theres too much money involved for Disney not to be pulling Marvels strings.  The problem is nobody buys comics so it doesnt really matter movie sales drive comic sales not the other way around.  On the other hand it doesnt hurt Disney to try.  Canceling the FF and Wolverine wouldnt cost them much considering but it might just hurt Fox enough to make a difference you never know.  And more importantly they wont be giving Fox any more free story ideas.  I dont know whats going on nobody knows whats going on.

1652530,0,t3_2d8yxu,Is it not more likely that because they have direct creative control that they can make better movies based on better written comics? There was a point where Avengers and Caps sales were so slumped they gave them to Leifeld to improve! But for the last  years Ive not had much need to read any Xtitles until the more recent books. Not because they were underhyped. Rather because they were overly crappy. Morrisons run on the books was the first bright spot in many years of poorly done stories.I really feel this article completely misses giving any due credit to Brian Micheal Bendis for turning the Avengers titles around. He started grabbing people with the whole Disassembled story arc in   years before the first IronMan movie even came out. If it wasnt for Bendiss writing Id never have read any of the Avengers. Now Avengers are so popular in the comics they need to mix them up with the Mutants just to keep people reading Xbooks. Which is the polar opposite of what it was for over  years at Marvel. The movies were inferior coming from Fox but what kept me from reading Xbooks was the even poorer quality of the lineup writing and art. Even when Claremont came back to the books it was a trainwreck. Its a testament to the Avengers creative teams from the last while that they were all shifted to Xbooks when the Marvel Now hit.,Marvel,cjngr03,3,t5_2r40o

After that you should go ahead and read Infinity Gauntlet For the Guardians heres the big Guardians recommendations thread rcomicbooks had a while ago  Heres a reading guide for the Guardians of the Galaxy and Marvels cosmic stories in general for the  era  In  Marvel launched a new Guardians series by Brian Bendis which starts with this volume here  A really cheap way to read all this stuff is with Marvel Unlimited Marvels digital subscription service. month or year gets you unlimited access to thousands of comics that you can read on your PC or tablet.,Marvel,cjx5647,4,t5_2r40o
1729509,1,t3_2e88sk,But history has proven that the superhero genre seems to be much more fragile. Superman  put superman out of commission for  years and then Superman returns took the man of steel for another years. Batman forever and its abomination of a sequel put Batman down for  years. Then there was Spider man Hulk Blade and fantastic Four. TASM was awful worse than spiderman  the only saving grace was the chemistry between Emma Stone and Garfield and TASM has been delayed back until  for unknown reasons many say because of how poor TASM was financially and criticallyEven with DC GL put the original plans DCs for JL to all but a halt.Marvel has been extremely lucky not having a dud especially GotG had that failed everyone DC Disney Fox and Sony would have second thoughts and be more cautious.

Why would you even give a shit enough to argue such a mute point?You will not see a movie where any of these heroes especially Iron Man is made to be the villain. They may but heads or break up but they wont have a while movie about them fighting especially outside of an Avengers movie.Civil was was about more than Cap. None of the events concerning Cap in Civil War would apply to the movies or work with contracts or lead to Avengers .Also winter soldier the dark world and the number  dont spoil anything... We know avengers  is happening because it was announced and is assumed we know cap wont die because we know the contracts and its a safe assumption that they wont kill anyone major.

A PG Deadpool would be great as long as they included breaking the fourth wall. Having him try and swear though the whole thing and getting vetoed bleeped out would be great if he was reacting to it and commenting on it. The violence should be pushed to the max of what that rating allows but again the unrealistic components would be commented on. The cherry on top would be another character getting to blurt out the one allowed FUCK per pg movie and having Deadpool react to that.In addition to this they should release an alternate version on home video thats rated R and includes meta speech from Deadpool commenting on the difference.,Marvel,ckhrxvq,11,t5_2r40o

I dont have numbers to back this up but I would be willing to bet that the majority of fans arent fans of the comic books and really have no clue as to the backgrounds of many of the characters or how they relate and interact with each other in the original context. And they dont care. Comic book movies got hot with Spiderman and XMen and Batman but Im talking Marvel here and realized a rejuvenation when Marvel Studios released Iron Man. The success of the Marvel movies have probably propped up the XMen and Spiderman to a point. There are plenty of dollars to go around and the bigger the fanbase of Marvel Studios gets the more runoff the lesser movies are going to see. They arent competing with Marvel Studios for quality or story but the Fox and Sony movies still have little chance of losing money especially if they play it safe and just churning out the same few storylines over and over. ,Marvel,clmj9oq,3,t5_2r40o

2329972,0,t3_2lynzk,Ok Im certainly not excited by this movie in general but seriously this is one choice that I dont have any issue with. Clearly they want to make it realistic and make the characters younger. It would make no sense to have a teenager be a king of a european country and even if they did there would be no way for him to friends with reed richards. Also Victor von Doom is a fucking ridiculous name especially for an Eastern European doom is an English word for christs sake it makes complete sense that they would change it to an actual Eastern European name. As for the programmer part all that seems to say is they are keeping the genius technological thing and putting it in a different setting. Making him an antisocial outcast instead of a generic evil mastermind monarch just makes him a more interesting character.The problem I have with this movie is the reasons behind the changes. Tranks trying to make something realistic and down to Earth when he should be embracing the whimsy. It seems like hes just trying to make Chronicle again but with a bigger budget. Its a misguided concept but what hes doing to Doom is the only way that the character could fit itself into that concept. Its not emasculating. Besides we know nothing about what hell end up as this is just the starting point.Again not trying to defend the movie. Its gonna suck. But wont be because of this.,Marvel,clzp48q,-1,t5_2r40o

2332355,0,t1_clzz6cq,They sold the Spidey film rights in the mids. Long before the financial troubles began. The Xmen rights were sold  years before they filed for chapter  and the initial payout from that was miniscule. The bulk of the money they received from those deals came from their backend percentages on the actual releases of the films which didnt happen until years after they were already safely back in the black. Marvel was actually out of pocket for a long time on the Fantastic  deal because they had to pay off Constantin Film to get the rights back so they could then give it to Fox. Again that was a backend heavy deal and the film was in development hell for many years before finally getting produced. The only that saved them from bankruptcy was the merger with Toy Biz. Film right sales had virtually no impact.

What truly got me when I watched the movie was the PeterGwen story the scoring really helped it to shine and the final scene with Rhino and the kid... but what of the other parts? Garfield himself had said in an interview that the movie couldve and shouldve been much better. But editorial decisions...And then there were the Sinister Six VenomCarnage and that femaleled movie... I sensed something strange. Sony seemed to jump too fast without backed by strong foundations.Then the whole hacking fiasco happened and now perhaps were going to see another reboot by Marvel.

At least thats how Marvels selling it. Were gonna have to wait and see just how it plays out but from this vantage point its not looking like a reboot.,Marvel,cnviqmu,3,t5_2r40o

3206160,0,t1_coua5ju,The term Marvel movie should stay broad if we are talking about Marvel Studios then we should specify that if we are talking about and adaptation of a Marvel character or story from another studio we should specify the studio but they both fall under the umbrella of a Marvel movie by virtue of being about Marvel intellectual property. Saying that only Marvel Studios makes Marvel movies carries the implication that only movies made by a production company owned by the publisher makes movies that ought be branded with the publishers name now would you agree that there are no DC movies? The clear implications of your logic says so afterall. Im guessing though that you dont think that because no one thinks that. I get that you are thinking of Marvel as in Marvel Studios but Marvel is bigger than that Fantastic Four and Xmen are just as much Marvel characters and their stories are just as much Marvel stories as the Avengers it doesnt matter whos producing the adaptations they deserve to be branded Marvel maybe not Marvel Studios but they belong under the umbrella of Marvel.,Marvel,coubfzn,-6,t5_2r40o

3356282,0,t1_cpas47t,My apologies for the snarkness in my comment. There are several ways in which reflection data can be gathered. While scouting with an HDRI probe. BeforeAfter shooting with a probe. During shooting where someone with a probe stands in cameras not rolling and someone with a probe stands in for what needs to be reflecting while the rest of the cast just hits their marks.. During shooting in a discrete location that is later edited out along with needing to edit out the working set crew which involves some effort but it has been done or else every HDRI spherical image would have a camera man in them . A lot can be done in post as well there are some newer devices that just gather more general lighting data while someone models out the set with or without the addition of matte paintings to supplement the reflections to be more accurate to what is intended. With AAA VFX houses like ILM WETA Digital Digital Domain Legacy Effects and so forth you can bet someone is there capturing data. How it is done exactly always varies on the scene the team and budgettime. . You can interchange an HDRI probe with a special fish eye lens or newer spherical cameras as well.For visual example here is a combination HDRI and Artifical reflective scene for a product Here is one purely from HDRI To supplement your researchstudies here is a good breakdown on how it was done a few but still relevent years ago I recommend looking on cgsociety.org as well for they often have interviews with various VFX teams on how they made the movies they worked on.,Marvel,cpaua2h,1,t5_2r40o

People know the SpiderMan story at this point like Superman so keep it simple and dont do anything to drastic where you would have to provide any background work that would take away from The Civil War story arc. Look at the new Fantastic Four they made Johnny black which to me is random especially since Sue is white.

You can read Hickmans New Avengers without worry until Infinity when the crossovers really start but the current events are the results of over half a decade of buildup in his other works particularly his Fantastic Four run which is the greatest of the FF runs and I highly recommend it.

3450063,0,t3_2zqmsw,I agree with the author that yet another rebooted SpiderMan would make no sense as audiences will be unfamiliar with him. This is why Im convinced that Tobey Maguires SpiderMan is making a comeback. He will make the perfect older world weary SpiderMan that appears in the comic civil war whos now a teacher and has a family. We wont need to see yet another origins story in fact Raimis origins story in SM was already perfect. In one move we will have the original SpiderMan trilogy become the first chronological entries in the MCUHeres my synopsis. After the events of SM Jj Jameson has relentlessly tried to discredit SM as a fraud a menace vigilante or possibly a publicity stunt. SHIELD also continuously does their clean up act for every SM adventure. Peter Parker feels disillusioned. He web slings less and less to focus on his relationship with MJ staring a family and becoming a teacher.The rise of very public Super Heroes like Cap and Iron man plus SM becoming a bit more reclusive means most of the world has forgotten SM or doubts he ever existed. Parker is happy with this and sees the world as being in the safe hands of the Avengers.During the battle of New York Parker is forced to defend his family. He is unable to aid the Avengers. While knowing that he made the right choice protecting his family a nagging guilt that SpiderMan wasnt there to protect New York eats at him. Jj writes a where was SpiderMan during all of this? Article that claims this is proof that SM was nothing but an unreliable menace all along.During Age of Ultron we see a scene where Iron Man is surrounded and in trouble by five of ultrons drones high above New York. It all looks lost when suddenly the nearest drones legs become tied together by a very familiar looking spiderweb. The web leads down to a rooftop where Tony sees SpiderMan for the first time. The Drone is attempting to fly away but Spidey holds him like a lassood horse using his spider strength. He whips out four more spider strands capturing the other Drones legs. He starts to spin in circles using the Drones own jet propulsion to give him momentum as he swings all five drones around and around in a circle above him faster and faster until finally sending them creasing down to earth in an evacuated Central Park.The Drones attempt to rise from the webbed mess theyve landed in when unexpectedly the Hulk comes slamming down on top of them stomping them into pieces before leaping off to find another battle.Tony looks at SpiderMan. Its an unfamiliar uniform for the Audience giving no clue as to which actor might be under the mask. Tony saysSo SpiderMan is real huh? Well how bout that? Hey thanks for the helpNo prob! SpiderMan stands with the AvengersSpiderMans voice is now disguised with an electronic voice distorter. Tony saysWhats with the voice? You worried about being recognised? You know I could easily see your face if I wanted...Go ahead and try pal says SpiderMan confidently.From Tonys POV we see him attempt to Xray scan Spideys suit to see the man beneath only to have it fail sensors unable to penetrate.Thats impressive. Wheres you get the material for that suit Mr Spider?I made it myself.You must be a very smart Spider to stop my scanners like thatLets just say that protecting my identity is very important to meUh huh yeah sure. Look I gotta go save the world now Mr Spider. If we survive this why dont you swing by Stark Tower some time? I enjoy talking with smart people.I just might says Spidey swinging away. In Civil War Spider man is back in the public eye. More popular than ever before JJ is almost entirely dedicating his newspaper to discrediting him. After Age of Ultron it appears that more and more heroes and villains have come to the publics attention despite the efforts of SHIELD and other agencies. Many wear masks and are perceived by the Media and governments as no better than vigilantes despite the good they do. The campaign for all heroes to register with the government has come to a head.The lines are drawn between Captain Americas camp and Iron mans. In a crucial scene we see Iron Man unashamedly appearing at a press conference as Tony Stark giving a press conference to large crowd of Media and reporters.

I didnt downvote anyone I love dissenting opinions on things I like its the most fun discussion in my opinion but its within reason that a fan subreddit downvote something that is trying to stall enthusiasm.

3825938,0,t1_cqry7zs,God I loved that show. Carter was the perfect balance. She wasnt an immunetoemotion badass which seems to be the creation of writers who dont know how to write subtle complex characters. Female characters emotions and real womens emotions for that matter are often played off as a joke or dismissed as overreactions or PMSing. Carter was special because she DID have emotions without ever feeling like a sexist womenbeemotionalamirite caricature. She pines for a man. But what makes her different is her raw anger and the way that love she harbors for her man becomes another facet to an already complex personality. On one hand she maintains this facade of being the perfect passive woman and some of those stereotypically feminine characteristics her loyalty to her boyfriend for example are what inspire her to act so far outside the norm. And that makes her really compelling. Im not explaining myself well here. Agent Carter took character points that I would normally consider tropes and are often used to create flat sexist female characters but goes beyond those tropes through extensive character development and the end result for me is a character who is eminently believable in her emotions and motivations. ,Marvel,cqse10t,1,t5_2r40o

3902520,0,t1_cr12fij,This is the correct answer.  It makes a lot of sense when you think about it.  Invincible Iron Man debuted at the same time as the Iron Man film so we got a very levelheaded Tony Stark and the incredible writing didnt hurt either. He saves Peppers life in The Five Nightmares by stabilizing her fatal injury the same way he stabilized his own  with a magnetic disk that prevented shrapnel from reaching her heart.  He leads the combined forces of The Mighty Avengers New Avengers Young Avengers Secret Wariors Thunderbolts and Hoods Gang against The Skrull Invasion at the end of Secret Invasion .  He provides Peppers with her upgrades during Worlds Most Wanted and provides her with the Rescue Model  Armor. He purges a large portion of information from his brain including the SHRA files to protect Osborn from getting the.  He finally picks Pepper as the woman he loves.   The big kicker is that Tony Starks brain is rebooted after the purge from a back up and theres no telling when it was last backed up.  Because he knows of Extremis and not anything about Civil War the popular guess is that the last back up was around the Extremis arc. Iron Man Volume     January   April   Tony then goes on to change Stark Industries to Stark Resilient.  He also reconciles with Thor and builds The Bleeding Edge armor with Mr. Fantastic.  The list goes on and on but Id also like to personally throw out that Hickmans Tony Stark isnt exactly a fuck up.  I think he did what had to be done and The Marvel Universe probably wouldnt have lasted as long as it did without his sacrifices also SPOILERS if you havent finished Time Runs Out and Secret Wars but Earth was shit out of luck against The Galactic Council until Tony used Sols Hammer.  ,Marvel,cr14e7t,3,t5_2r40o

Waid may not have the same sort of epic writing style as someone like Hickman or Remender but hes probably one of the most consistent writers Ive read in my  years of comic reading.

I thought Theta Protocol was the mission to take out hydra but the code name was directly involved in the helicarrier which wasnt even used in that mission. Then Fury was on the flight deck of the carrier and on the show they give Phil all the credit. It just seems strange and like a problem that a couple lines of dialogue could fix.Maybe I missed something though.

Agent of SHIELD Hawkeye by Matt Fraction vol.  My Life as a Weapon Black Widow by Nathan Edmondson vol.  The Finely Woven Thread Avengers by Jonathan Hickman vol.

I loved Guardians of the Galaxy from the first time I saw it and every other time I watched it. Secondly I thought all the characters in GOTG were great and liked the dynamic between them. The Avengers spent a lot of time bitching and not trusting each other even though they didnt have as much reason for that as the characters in GOTG did the Avengers mostly considered themselves and each other as the good guys while the Guardians is made up of people with questionable morality and painful or criminal pasts but nobody tried to hide it. Ultimately it comes down to each fans opinion and my opinions will very likely remain more favorable towards GOTG.

Hes so convinced he infallible that the one time something blew up in his face and scarred him left him completely shattered and he thinks he has to hide his deformity I prefer Kirbys depiction of a minuscule scar Doom doesnt hide his face because its ugly he hides it because its a reminder of his fallibility.  Im not a big fan of the Dooms actually hideous because hes stupid enough to put a glowing hot mask on his face explanation.

4263378,0,t3_39t36b,. SHIELD took the sceptre but because it was run by a bunch of HYDRA agents anyway they took it. I think theres an explanation of how in the leadup comic if youre really curious. See Cap end credits. Hydra has been playing with out of the ordinary power sources for decades but theyve also had a chance to get an upclose look at arcreactors see Cap . A SHIELD team came in and cleaned up offcamera because its just not that interesting.. Im not sure they got the powers from the gem. I really think HYDRA was experimenting with terrigen crystals somehow.. You missed the real joke  in Tony Starks mind there arent women that wouldnt want to have sex with him. Especially if hes the ruler of Asgard. It was a joke about his ego. Get over it.. We know Cap is using SHIELD resources to look for his best friends instead of whats in the best interest of the people of his country and has trouble putting his differences with others aside to get a job done. Not exactly qualities of someone worthy.. Baron Strucker and Baron Zemo is too much for casual fans.. Stark had extensive knowledge of the black market and they knew what Ultron was looking for so its not really a coincidence.. Calling Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver punks is a bit disingenuous.. This is poor planning. Youre right.. Nick Fury wasnt retired. He goes to Eastern Europe at the end of Cap .. Yes but it didnt bother me much since this was quickly done to advance the plot not a major part of it.. Falcon is working on a missing persons case for Cap referenced in the beginning of the movie. Everyone else who showed up was pretty much together DC and for arguments sake we can assume he was elsewhere NYC. If you dont like that explanation then just assume his suit hadnt been rebuilt.. The Avengers were handling it and they couldnt get clearance to go into Sokovian airspace. Or their communications were interrupted by Ultron. Take your pick.. Youre thinking too much into this. The powers that be were led by HYDRA again see Cap.... Somebody had to die. Quicksilver wasnt a very good character in this movie. Maybe its because they cut too much. Either way Im glad to see Hawkguy walk away.,Marvel,cs678s6,4,t5_2r40o

However Alan Davis has stated that the designation of Earth  was actually first made by Dave Thorpe the previous writer of the UKpublished Captain Britain stories.gtIn addition a difference of opinion exists regarding the selection of the number . In  Alan Moores soninlaw John Reppion who is married to Alan Moores daughter Leah Moore stated on an Internet message board that the number  was arbitrarily chosen by Moore and had no significant meaning saying it was just a random number of no significance chosen because people always seemed to be talking about earth  or earth  but never any higher numbers.

4759822,0,t1_ctudvpt,I just came back from watching the film and it isnt actually bad. The people going on about how bad this movie is are insane. Is it great? Not at all. But the fault clearly doesnt lie in the tone style script or even its low budget. The biggest issue plaguing this movie is that it is paced way way too quickly.Two things either happened here either execs demanded that any scene that expanded upon characters and relationshipsscenes that didnt immediately push the film forwardbe cut for time or they were blatantly cut before they were ever even shot.As it has been marketed from the outset this movie is very much a scifi drama that happens to be an adaptation of a superhero comic property. But it is not a superhero movie. And anyone who gives this movie a chance will see that they werent trying to make one. This was a slower characterdriven film that was edited into a quickpaced film with an ending that was clearly not the original.You know who wont like this movie? Fanboys and people expecting and demanding that it be something that it isnt. That Fantastic Four were never traditional superheroes by design. They were not vigilantes punching at everything. They were explorers that often got roped into trouble and had to work together physically and mentally to resolve it.The only thing that seemed off about this film was the big fight with Doom which seemed tacked on. The ending was clearly not originally intended to be a physical fight. They repeatedly state what the real threat is supposed to be. And it even does happen though its clearly edited into something they could punch at rather than deal with as this group should be dealing with it.Im prepping to write a full review that covers this movie in ways that no review Ive read or seen has just yet. But despite it being a clear case of a studio hacking at a film in its budget and in the editing room the movie came out pretty decent. Its interesting. Its got some good characters and concepts. But its chopped down into scenes that are just long enough. You can tell where there was supposed to be character building present more quiet scenes between Reed and Ben and everyone else including Victor. But it all got left on the cutting room floor in order to move the film along at a more superhero style pace. Like Ben it was turned into something in a freak accident not by design.,Marvel,ctuirbq,2,t5_2r40o

4760912,0,t1_ctuf7ia,From everything Ive read which is just about every blurb since this thing was announced Trank had no desire to make a FF movie at all. It was basically going to be a survival horror film but the studio stepped in and added the FF.Everybody is to blame since a horror movie loosely based on an upbeat campy comic should have never been greenlit.Trank had no desire to make it a comic film and was very open about that. If the studio wanted a comic book movie they shouldnt have ever hired him or at least replaced him early on.Im thrilled the film is failing though because this was clearly only for rights renewal. This gives Marvel Studios all the leverage in the world to get Galactus and Silver Surfer. Im still hoping it can happen in time to have the Surfer herald the coming of Thanos in Dr. Strange as a book end to tie it into the MCU.,Marvel,ctunoht,11,t5_2r40o

I think coming from nothing and becoming the ruler of a country is a story people would want to see. Its like when you read how JK Rowling was sleeping in her car but wrote Harry Potter which became a sensation. Its uplifting because the audience thinks shit if they can do it why cant I?  It also shows that Doom prevails even in the worse situation. Take away his power his technology and he is still Doom. Hell come back because he is a survivor. ,Marvel,ctvbhxi,2,t5_2r40o

4790963,0,t1_ctyd5ac,Everyone has rules in their lives. Some people measure the value of lives differently. Thats it. Whether or not they kill or save lives people do that. Kids are usually protected because they are innocent or in disaster situations because they can not fend for themselves as much as an adult.When it comes to value many people just believe childrens lives deserve higher priority in terms of presentation because of many reasons. Talking about innocence its because they are young and havent lived long enough to have a chance at life. Going off that they havent lived long enough to be choosing where they stand in a situation and are therefore innocent. The lifeboat thing follows the same idea that women and children cant do shit for themselves so the men have to help them get to safety first before worrying about themselves. Its assumed men can handle themselves better so they are not the priority when you want to save as many lives as possible.Its not solely about value but various factors. ,Marvel,ctyfujx,3,t5_2r40o

Peter Parker is a normal dude with a big brain and a LOT to deal with not some pathetic socially inept loser who cant talk to women. So many people think that theres supposed to be this Clark KentSuperman duality in the character but Ive never found that to be the case. Peter is still Peter when he puts on the mask hes just free to be the hero he otherwise couldnt be.

4866265,0,t1_cu7kupu,Doom and Thanos are on par as far as intelligence goes. As far as raw strength is concerned Id take Thanos as he can handily beat BB and Thor has gone toe to toe with Odin and survived fights with Galactus. I dont want to take anything away from Doom as sometimes he is written extremely strong and I think he has beaten out Galactus on an occasion or two by sapping him of his power as opposed to fighting him head on. It should be noted that both have been universal threats Thanos with the infinity gauntlet and Doom with the power of the Beyonder.Overall Thanos is at lowest a galactic threat and usually finds himself in a position to be a universal threat Thanos imperative Infinity Gauntlet etc. Doom has reached those upper echelons but still manages to have trouble dealing with raw power such as Thor or a herald. This is not to say Doom couldnt win if he had time to plan but a head on confrontation would not end well for Doom  times. ,Marvel,cu7xhrr,21,t5_2r40o

It really was escalation of something that need not have happened.  Again this happens in comic books quite often as the actions of the characters can often serve the needs of the plot.Theres some good Avengers runs out there and I honestly find Hickmans to be my alltime favorite save for that White Event stuff.

A synchronized MU and MCU change would certainly be interesting if not quite difficult to juggle.

That he could be a better hero than Peter was which I knew could never be true but hey give the guy a chance.Man it was disappointing. Every issue I hoped maybe hed have a moment where hed realize what really made SpiderMan well SpiderMan the heart the quips all that stuff. But as the premise was set it was just like a What If Otto Octavious was SpiderMan? He was a dbag to both his friendsfellow heroes and family with the except of Anna Marie and as a huge Spidy fan it was hard for me to read at times plus it made life difficult for Peter when he returned but thats that old Parker Luck. His whole SpiderDrones thing was kind of cool allowing him to keep tabs on the city but of course that backfired. He even got Spidy kicked out of the Avengers temporarily I guess but still. By around I think  I kept hoping that Peter would be back within an issue or two. I kept going with it seeing maybe hell redeem himself. And I suppose at the end in a way he does by finally admitting that maybe just maybe he was wrong and the only man who could be SpiderMan was Peter Parker. I burst out in joy at this scene in .

5128995,0,t3_3l8crn,Red Skull could show up in Guardians Vol.  but I dont see that being incredibly likely. Hugo Weaving doesnt want to and probably wont return so my ideal recast would be Cristoph Waltz. At any rate Id like to see him in space as Thanos lieutenant maybe as his chief tactician or some such thing.Last I heard Abomination was in SHIELD custody out in Alaska and was considered for the Avengers Initiative. Who knows what happened to him after SHIELDs fall In The Winter Soldier? Anyway I reckon we could see Abomination as soon as Civil War though his appearance would be pretty small mentioned by Ross or security footage or whatever. The next proper appearance for Abomination would probably be in either Infinity War. If he still hasnt rocked up at that point...who knows?As for The Leader...I have no clue. Like Abomination he could show up in Infinity War or in a mention or tape in Civil War but other than that he could show up in Doctor Strange perhaps? Dont ask me why this is probably the most likely appearance if we dont see him again before Infinity War.Ultimately I think we will see more of Red Skull Abomination and The Leader again in that order. Other dormant villains include Batroc the Leaper Crossbones you know hes in Civil War Loki as Odin Justin Hammer The Mandarin hes the real one this time I swear! Arnim Zola surely Hydra backed him up. Robot body anyone? and Ultron maybe? Perhaps he copied himself elsewhere or Thanos has a rudimentary copy? Look Id like Ultron to come back somehow so Im sure theres a possibility. There are some antagonistic organizations out there too. The Ten Rings and Hydra are still around and maybe AIM wasnt fully destroyed in Iron Man . You could make a case for the Ravagers from GotG but theyre not really villainous or even that much of a hassle. Oh and of course there are the TV villains who I really dont feel like talking about seeing as this is already a very long rambling that if you took the time to read a. Im sorry b. whatre you doing with yourself? and c. thanks for toughing it out.Alright! So yeah TLDR Red Skull should come back by Infinity War Part II perhaps as Thanos new tactician and Abomination and the Leader could show up in Civil War in brief cameos but I wouldnt expect much more from them in Phase III.,Marvel,cv48ie6,1,t5_2r40o

5219641,0,t3_3mhhh7,In New Avengers Illuminati its heavily implied Secret Wars II was done on a simulation Earth and none of it actually happened.From WikipediagtDuring the opening moments of the first Secret Wars Professor Xavier and Reed Richards unsuccessfully attempted rendering the abducted heroes and villains forced to participate in Secret Wars unconscious using Xaviers powers of telepathy. The rationale behind their failed plan was that doing so would deny the Beyonder the pleasure of watching the two sides fight solely for his entertainment. The issue also contends that the Illuminati confronted the Beyonder during the events of Secret Wars II a storyline with major continuity errors Tony Stark referenced as participating in the first Secret Wars when it was actually James Rhodes in Starks Iron Man armor. The Beyonder is proclaimed to be an Inhuman who was a mutant before he was exposed to the Terrigen Mists as well as the implication that the events of Secret Wars II never really happened and took place within an asteroid replica of Earth the Beyonder created and that Black Bolt under the guise as the Beyonders king convinced him to go into another dimensional exile as such the canonical status of Secret Wars II is unknown.,Marvel,cvf5q6p,3,t5_2r40o

5592266,0,t1_cwplhff,How does Pym learn from his mistakes? Reed I agree doesnt learn from his mistakes but Reed while a scientist is a family man and protecting his family is his arc. Reed is a selfless hero in that regard. Tony well hes arrogant but genuinely tries to do the right thing and he genuinely tries to stop doing bad things but his selfishness and addictive personality continually stop him. That being said I dont like Tony Stark more than I do Pym.But Id argue that Pym doesnt learn from his mistakes. He has a belief that he is too smart for people to understand and he does think hes right all the time but people are too stupid to comprehend it. And because of that he always believes the other Avengers belittle and look down on him and it perpetuates a cycle where he continually feels the need to prove himself as a hero.And that is his arc a cycle of feeling less than he feels he deserves and then doing too much to compensate and then trying to prove himself a hero. But the reality is being a hero should be in service of others pr a greater good. Hank Pym is just in service to his ego trying to make others believe hes one. Hes doing it for validation.And he is a joke in the Avengers and no one believes in him. So thats why he beats his wife and created Ultron.The only reason he would and thats if he wanted to even go back and not create Ultron would be because literally Ultron tries to destroy mankind. But without that knowledge hed still do it again and even more than that if he was given the knowledge hed think he would be above it and try to not let that happen but it inevitably would. Ultron would be created no matter what. And Ive seen no time where Pym tries to change for the better. And changing superficial things like costumes doesnt change the man underneath.,Marvel,cwq9ue7,1,t5_2r40o

As the sidebar indicates this is a subreddit for the comics though naturally there will be some healthy overlap. In this instance I think the onus is on the redditor to say I should be careful there because Im late to the game and there will be a lot of spoilers. You might also make the argument where does it end? At which point do we officially say something is old enough to not warrant a spoiler tag? Does the revelation of the Green Goblins identity need a spoiler tag? Or the fate of Gwen Stacy? At some point I think the smart thing to do is just draw a line.

5640327,0,t1_cww53m1,gt Race doesnt equal how relatable someone is. It really shouldnt matter. But it does. In America race does matter. You will get treated differently because you look different. When theres a dirth of people who look like you and have similar life experiences in a medium. You tend to relate to them more. As a black guy Im deficient relate to a black character. For example growing up I related to static so much. gtIm all for more black and women characters but for goodness sakes be original and MAKE NEW ONES instead of changing established ones or giving away earned mantles.If I showed you some original new heroes of colors. Who star in their own books. And the books were good. Some even award winning. Would you buy them? Because its one thing to talk about how youre for more diverse heroes. Its another thing to be about it. If you aint bout that life you slick sound like a hypocrite. ,Marvel,cww8j8c,2,t5_2r40o

5840930,0,t1_cxl0xbh,Time travel in the Marvel Universe is not written particularly consistently but generally changing the past forks the timeline rather than overwriting it. You dont create a temporal paradox or anything by pulling people from the past because the present thats changed by the fact that they were pulled from the past is a different timeline and our perspective stayed with this timeline.Similarly if someone from a dystopian future comes to the present to prevent their dystopian future from happening they cant truly prevent it. They can only fork the timeline so that theres a future where their dystopia doesnt happen. Which is also why there are characters from like four different dystopian futures in XMen  all of those futures come to pass just in different timelines.,Marvel,cxl9tyd,13,t5_2r40o

5868348,0,t1_cxosktc,I liked his run on DD and i absolutely LOVED what he did with Ultimate Spiderman.  But again in those instances he stuck to the continuity or he had a blank canvas.His writing just irritates the hell out of me when it comes ot GoTG and especially the treatment he gave to Nova. I was introduced to the cosmic side of Marvel with Dan and Andy and they gave me an amazing space opera. I hold it to the same caliber that a story like star wars told in terms of scope and breadth. But with Bendis taking over it pretty much just acted like none of it ever happened.   and my BIGGEST gripe is his damn habit of reviving dead characters and not even fucking acknowledging it. Case in point Corsair from the Space Jammers. He had his goddamn head blown off by Vulcan. The guy was dead as dead can be. But then Bendis gets on the book and says LOL I DONT CARE and the only reference we get about it is a toss away one liner It wasnt until months later that we got any sort of answer as to why that happened and even then it took Greg Rucka and Russell Dauterman to actually come out and explain it.  I just have this image of Bendis sitting in a conference room with action figures  Bendis whooosh  pew pew AND THEN CAPTAIN MARVEL SHOWS UP AND...   Editors Uh Mike. You cant use Captain Marvel hes dead.  Bendis So?  Editors Right. Ok. So how are you going to explain his coming back from cancer?  Bendis Fuck if I know.

Ive always enjoyed the split personality dynamic of HulkBanner but its always been more enjoyable to me when they give Hulk a certain level of intelligence. Not necessarily geniuslevel but enough to have a grammatically correct conversation with people. The old onedimensional Hulk is strongest there is shtick while iconic does not make for interesting stories where Hulk is the central character. That was something that bothered me about the Red Hulk Saga which is also pretty good that happened soon after World War Hulk. Hulk was a dope again. Im sure they explained it away at some point.

6073251,0,t1_cyfohhh,A fair question.  Deadpool is not a character in this run he is a meme. Every sentence out of his mouth was written with the sole purpose of being poster onto tumblr.  The writing is just unforgivably lazy. There is no overarching plot just issue to issue stuff. Way said in an interview once that the only reason he wrote Deadpool for so long was that because he didnt even have to think when he was writing it. At the end of the day you might get a laugh or two out of it but its not Deadpool. Its enjoyable for an issue or two but after that you can feel your brain cells deteriorating. The only good thing to come out of it was a larger Deadpool fanbase leading to stuff like a Deadpool movie becoming possible. Duggans run is a perfect evolution of the character. He takes the witty but dark and troubled Deadpool from Kellys run and adds a hint of Memepool from Ways run to please every Deadpool fan out there and really just write some fantastic stories. There are some more comedic focused arcs in his run such as Dead Presidents and there are some serious and dark arcs like The Good The Bad and The Ugly my favorite Deadpool story ever I might add.. And throughout the entire run Duggan maintains an overarching plot. For those reasons I would never recommend Waypool to someone just starting out with the character.,Marvel,cyfousi,3,t5_2r40o

6265500,0,t1_cz1nqsp,In the comics Jessicas insecurity undermined her ability to control her powers and that was reflected in the show. The show hints that TV Jessicas inability to fly is not so much that she cant as shes unwilling to try much less practice. When she takes off from her house in Episode  I think imbued with purpose and righteous venegance it was strongly implied that she flew Kilgrave back to the city.From a practical standpoint I think it is difficult to show a liveaction flying character and not have it look corny. I dont know if thats because it requires a big special effects budget because the poses flying characters have in comics look silly in real life or just because flying such an obviously superhero trope that it is difficult to fit into a noirthemed show. Or maybe its something else. Whatever the case I think Netflix was right to not even go there. The jumping scenes looked awkward enough.,Marvel,cz1tfxd,3,t5_2r40o

Maybe even all three.Showing that what Hitler considered subhumans could step up fight him and bring him down would have been amazing and actually piss off the nazis. With an aryan they ended up just making a white savior superhero.This would also help the diversity issue that Marvel struggled with since its inception. If Cap was black from the getgo nerds on the internet wouldnt be pissed off about Sam Wilson taking up the shield since you know Captain America would have been a black superhero all along. ,Marvel,cz9n1b0,-6,t5_2r40o

This deal included SpiderMan and all associated characters going to Sony although now Sony and Marvel have worked out a deal and the XMen and Fantastic Four and all associated characters going to Fox. This means unless Fox decides to collaborate with Marvel well never see mutants in the MCU.

Beast is odd because hes an Avenger so should be chill with Spidey but I guess is just being a douchenozzle and doesnt really distrust him. Some more examples for you Prodigy Jubilee and Ink all live at the school despite being depowered andor never actually a mutant.

Simply put I just find your double standards about this whole thing really bizarre and I dont get it which is why I continued to ask you for clarification. Personally Im enjoying all the femaleled comics from Marvel now. None of them come across at all like pandering but you seem very intent on maintaining the belief that it is regardless of whether its true or not. Almost all of the femaleled ANAD comics have been successful some are even among the top sellers and the fans and the market have clearly been receptive to the shift towards more balanced representation even though theres still a long way to go overall. Im going to leave this discussion here because I dont feel its productive and its becoming a little intense. Again Im sorry if you felt personally insulted.,Marvel,d0dxsy8,2,t5_2r40o

In universe they are the big .gt I do however wonder why immediately after saying popularity didnt matter you then cited a Google result.It was if you were wondering what the general consensus was. The big  could for an example be SpiderMan Wolverine and Hulk for most people. But for Marvel its Cap Iron Man and Thor. gtI dont think Marvel has a trinity. I dont think Marvel needs a trinity. Which is why I started reading Marvel  years ago.Thats probably because Marvel has more popular heroes outside of the main    whereas with DC most of their known heroes are the main Justice League members and most other heroes and villains are obscure to the public or casual fans. Marvel has always had one though. Its just less noticeable because their popular characters are more spread out and because their big  didnt consist of their most popular hero.,Marvel,d0o8fj4,1,t5_2r40o

The girl the xman is holding is a mutant with no powers just deformities that he hides away in his house while the city holds a witch hunt to kill all of the mutants. Its a very powerful story and a very good read. It think if you gave it a shot without an angry perspective you would enjoy it. Also as others pointed out it is much before the sjw movement and all the events are based off of s era comics of the heros the overall book doesnt even really preach the SJW mindset since the narrator starts off hating the mutants and even throwing rocks at them in protest he leaves his family over how upset he is that these super humans are in power. ,Marvel,d0tikcc,8,t5_2r40o

Anyone who actually know about Thor the comic book Thor probably never said anything like that. They are NOT Gods they are godly creatures that are more powerful than average human so they are considered as Gods in old times. But they are not literally Gods with a worshipers or anything.

6880741,0,t1_d0w82ms,Its important for these three characters because of the dynamic they bring to their characters beyond just the tired I have a secret identity to protect my loved ones schtick. Its important for SpiderMan as a character because of what he represents as a character. Hes the everyman the average joe with the kind of realworld problems that we all face every day. If he lost he secret identity than he becomes a celebrity and he loses that quality thats so important to his character. Hes just like every other super hero thats living in Avengers mansion. Its important to his character even if its not entirely realistic in a world of camera phones. His averageness is what makes SpiderMan great and every time they try to move away from that they ruin the character.Superman on the other hand is basically the opposite of SpiderMan. Hes an alien god from another planet. A mythic being who could annihilate the whole world with a wave of his hand. His secret is what makes him a grounded character. Whereas SpiderMan is an average guy who puts on a mask to become a largerthanlife hero Superman is a largerthanlife hero who puts on a mask to become an average guy. And some of the best Superman stories come from the balance between his life as Superman and Clark Kent. Without his secret identity his stories would be just punchups between him and villains with no real human drama to act as a counterpoint.And Batman is different from both because he doesnt even really have any loved ones to protect besides Alfred. His secret identity is important because of psychological aspect of the character and what happens when Bruce Wayne puts on the mask. Psychodrama is a huge part of Batmans stories and that would be lost if Batman didnt have an identity.,Marvel,d0w8wmh,15,t5_2r40o

6994783,0,t3_4bht2w,It does look a lot like him. But I dont think that Marvel would undo yet another Whedon death. Or maybe they would? I know the Coulson one bothered Whedon so maybe after his not so positive comments about the process of making AoU theyre just sticking it to him? Also Whedon did plan on bringing him back at the end of AoU but thought that doing that cheapened his death. I just saw that in another video that the og plan was to bring him back. Considering he can heal faster than normal and that that was the plan and that it does look A LOT like him. Itd be pretty cool if he did come back. I actually prefer AoU to the first avengers. The biggest downside to me was his death. Im a Quicksilver fan and think that its important that he and Wanda have more time together as theyre kind of a duo and their relationship is important to their individual character development. Bringing him back may be a bit too much but I think that that power set is needed in the MCU. Oh and Aaron Tyler Johnson signed a multiple film contract supposedly. So theres that too.

I think all their cartoons are terrible while DC cartoons are a must see for me. The movies are unfortunately not good. Which will automatically brand me a Marvel fan boy every where I comment. Yet Im going to comment. Your best bet is to not take it personal and either step away or just give your honest opinions on things and ignore the responses. ,Marvel,d1ade2k,5,t5_2r40o

At least thats how Ive always seen it. It reminds me of the scene in the BendisMaleeve run where he carves into Bullseyes forehead with a piece of glass. Thats pretty fucked. Or in season one where he kicks that dude off the building and has to wait to hear a heart beat to make sure he didnt really kill him.

Iron Man called together the meeting to propose that they form a shadowgovernment of sorts that would coordinate superhuman affairs from the shadows. This was an unpopular suggestion however and the others didnt agree that it was a good idea. They reached a compromise that they would meet and discuss things of great importance and tackle great threats together. Everyone except Black Panther agreed to this. Black Panther refused to take part in the group because he felt that it was wrong for them to decide matters in secret without consulting anyone else and predicted that one day there would be a disaster and the Illuminati would be divided on how to solve it leading to conflict. He did however promise to keep their secret. ,Marvel,d1e6r1r,1,t5_2r40o

He thinks that Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot are great though none of the characters are particularly fleshed out.  He emphasizes that Superman is basically Superman the whole movie without ever getting a chance to be Clark.  He did not feel anything emotionally with the end of the movie.Im not sure I agree  that Marvel adding humor to movies is setting the tone and style of comic book movies.  Nolans Batman movies were pretty serious and I thought they were great.  I do agree  that Marvels ability to humanize characters has been a big reason their movies have succeeded.

7358020,0,t3_4g4hhr,I actually did the same marathon over the past couple of weeks. A lot of fun stick with it if you can.Iron Man was great to watch after so long. It really does stand well on its own its not hard to see how it served as such a stable launchpad for the universe. Strong characters throughout though I agree Terrance Howards Rhodes was different from Don Cheadles not sure which one I like better and a wellcontained plot straightforward but moved along by just how strong some of the performances were. Having not seen the movie in so long Id almost forgotten just how great Robert Downey Jr. is as Tony. Its kind of insane how fun he is to watch. Hes an asshole yeah but his very internal flaws almost make him feel like more of a real hero to me especially compared to some of the other characters later on. Its great to watch him grow while keeping grounded as his lovably dickish self in each of his movies and the universe as a whole.Wasnt a huge fan of Incredible Hulk. I did think it was better than I remember it being in the theater and probably better than most people give it credit for online though. I thought its main problem was that it was just pretty genericby the numbers. Even now having watched it just a couple of weeks ago now Id have trouble describing any of the characters. I remember what they did and all but none of it seemed to be driven by who they were if that makes any sense. The movie was just kind of like this big cat and mouse game between Ross and Banner with a few people on either side love interest evil Hulk wacky scientist going through the motions. But yeah I mean they did do that at least so I agree with the whole okay and fairly entertaining thing. It was interesting how much they set up with Mr. Blue and the end scene that they didnt capitalize on Tony mentions the Avengers Initiative which we learn fell through sometime before Avengers  but maybe since were seeing Ross in Civil War that means well see more coming from this movie soonish?Let us know what you think of Iron Man . I also remembered liking it in theaters though my opinion of it had faded a little over the years until I watched it this time.  Another movie I think people give a harder time than it deserves.,Marvel,d2ek1qf,8,t5_2r40o

7442943,0,t1_d2g9ian,Not really enjoying what theyre doing with Sam here. I mean I get that Old Man Steve is very different from Cap Steve not that I agree with that but the whole Steve believes his country will always do whats right when it comes down to it thing flies in the face of over  years of character development literally twice as long or more than his total publication history before the Secret Empire stuff caused him to leave the role of Cap. Ever since his run in with the Secret Empire and discovering the US government had been infiltrated Steve hasnt really represented the American government but rather American ideals. I mean that was the whole point of Civil War. It really bothers me that theyre making this out to be a major difference between Sam and Steve.And that having been said I dont find Sam Cap to be an interesting replacement for Steve Cap. Rather than find his own areas he can be interesting in theyre basically making him the same character as Steve always has been but instead altering Steves character for the worse to make a distinction.Ignoring my issues with Captain Falcon though this isnt a terrible story. I just wish they got the characters right since thats a major part of whats going on.,Marvel,d2o7rdm,2,t5_2r40o

Just because shes become a moving juggernaut it just sucks that they just had to put such emphasis on her and thats even in First Class where the Hunger Games hadnt taken off just yetI think Mystique was already Xaviers half sister?

7722283,0,t3_4kzwbg,Bravo.  Excellent post.  I feel the exact same way.  Im a high school teacher and I sometimes talk to my students about comics before school starts.  They know Im a huge Thor fan and sometimes ask how I feel about Thor being a woman.  When I have the time to go into it and Im speaking to a student who is mature and thoughtful we get it into a discussion of the political agenda that is driving these character changes.  If anyone at Marvel thinks that their agenda isnt obvious and offensive they are either fooling themselves or they are so isolated in their sociopolitical echo chamber that they really dont see what theyre doing.Anyway you have really summed up and expressed my thoughts succinctly here.

Jack is able to withstand impact and blunt trauma forces to a much greater degree than a human.

7748280,0,t1_d3m7nui,gt A lot of people expect every comic book movie to be absolutely perfect and a direct rip from the comics. As a super comic book fan mainly for the XMen which is who I am very defensive for or offended by when they screw around with things too much like...Iceman its not that I want Xmen to be like the comic books its that I want them to care about the characters. I like and still like the first XMen film despite the glaring problems from the costumes to the way they treated Cyclops. I still enjoyed it and it was more because of the lines. Especially the conversations between Professor X and Magneto. Those lines that make you excited for whats to come next like the end scene. OMG. That scene where theyre playing chess and they have that conversation thats repeated at the end of this film....it gave me chills. Though the actual event of them coming to the school was far less exciting. Its nice to see them use their powers but I like the characters. I like that Cyclops is a stick in the mud sometimes that hes serious because hes always thinking of how to keep everyone safe always thinking of the next move...knowing how each person is in battle so he can use them to their best ability for the most effective outcome. Thats the Cyclops Ive been waiting for in the film and he never ever ever shows up. Until now I got a glimpse of him. I agree. Theyve turned Mystique into another Wolverine. Making one mutant more important than the others makes every XMen fan know you dont understand the core material that well.,Marvel,d3mx7u4,19,t5_2r40o

For all the people that Steve Rogers Captain America  is their first issue thats it.Captain America has been secretly a member of Hydra all along.How many of the people reading comics for the first time are going to immediately stop because of that last page? How many people are going to stop reading comics for  or  years before they dip their toe back in? How many people are going to go for  years thinking Yeah Captain America big hypocrite. Hes been a Nazi this whole time.?How many Jewish people looking for acceptance and inclusion knowing about Jack Kirby and Joe Simons creation are going to hear about this either first second fifth or eighthhand will feel like being slapped in the face? Not all of them sure but many of those are also going to be sitting and stewing on their false impression of Captain America in the comics like you did for who knows how long?It might be temporary.

7773613,0,t1_d3ps7js,Youre entirely correct although I think theres a meaningful distinction. This whole Red Skull as Trump bit is a blatant attack on right wing Americans. Im not saying media shouldnt be able to do that it certainly should. I just think that pitching the cause to fight against a foreign oppressor is fundamentally different than pitching the cause to fight other Americans. These arent people who want to round up people and commit genocide theyre people with different ideas about immigration. Painting other Americans with a brush that labels them as bad and unethical simply because they have different beliefs is fundamentally unAmerican in my opinion and thats why I personally feel like its different.

Its why its such a shame.Although I dont think Id care if Fox tried to have its cake and eat it too and continue their splintered continuity and let Marvel also use the Xcharacters and just pay them money. I mean people are already introduced to the idea that there were two different Quicksilvers even if they dont understand. And the people who care already understand how it works. And I mean Sonys trying to do a limited version of this by thinking they can use Venom separately from Spiderman.Itd be great if Fox can decide using its greed and just be all Ok heres our deal you can pay us to use these characters we have the rights to and well also make our own version of these characters.I mean hey multiverse. It would not be ideal but it would totally be acceptable.

Black Bolt is currently  the owner of the Quiet Room club a neutral ground where anybody can meet up.  Peace is ensured because anybody who starts trouble faces the wrath of Black Bolt himself. The Quiet Rooms status as a neutral ground allows for meetings of any purpose from wrestling press conferences between diehard rivals to poker games between nefarious super villains.I have no idea where the other Inhuman Queens are.

This magic as initially written by Steve Englehart in the s looks a lot more like Wicca  connections to the earth spirituality and the elements.Note that her powerset doesnt include reality manipulation though she can pull off amazing feats when possessed by Chthon or by other grand or malevolent forces see the Life Force in House of M thats the exception and not the rule.,Marvel,d4cqzfc,6,t5_2r40o

8154163,0,t1_d4wrv0n,To clarify the ongoing comic stuff comics are usually written in story arcs which have a beginning and end but they still lend to the next story arc in the series. Dark Phoenix Saga for example is actually just a story issues  in the Uncanny XMen series and Days of Future Past occurs a little later issues . When someone recommends writer Xs run they are just recommending all of the collected stories connected andor standalone written by that person pedantic I know. Marvel even sells some printeddigital editions based on runs instead of storiesthey are just a collection of stories like buying Dr. Seuss Green Eggs and Ham or buying his whole run including it and all the others like The Lorax. But that doesnt mean you HAVE to start from the beginning of a numbered series. In fact comics back then were made as if each comic was a readers first. There are too many comics to consume some most of which is not worth the time. Readers had to just start recommending specific runs that stand out as being higher quality AND partially standalone even inside a continuous series. Superhero comics are also known for reboots to welcome new readership. So  is where Chris Claremont took over told his own stories in his own style and marked an uptick in quality that readers claim is a good starting point.,Marvel,d4wtgl9,1,t5_2r40o

Vance told Rocket StarLord and the others that he was from the Guardians of the galaxy Rocket and StarLord liked the name so they decided to call themselves that.I also recommend people to read the original GotG because Gunn took some elements from that team and their stories for his GotG movie Yondu the Ravagers who can potentially be Peters father which can easily go over peoples heads who arent familiar with that source material.,Marvel,d4x20nu,1,t5_2r40o

Its said that vibranium has properties far beyond what normal people use it for. If TChalla can make a suit of of the stuff that is cloth it supports the idea that it is the material that makes Visions skin. Which then brings up other potentialities.

She chooses to use his power before understanding it and that is what has gotten people killed.Look maybe that Celestial was one thing where they had to act all the rest wouldnt have been world killing cataclysms which should give them time to investigate.If instead of just jumping to action at every vision she should have spent more time trying to understand how the visions work.

8453692,0,t3_4vgpx3,Yes but it has been stated that Matts radarsense is stronger than Peters spidersense.Peter has explained that he can navigate a room using only his spidersense its the reason he doesnt have to open his eyes to fight someone or can still fight in a pitch black room.While the general consensus is that the spidersense is a dangersense some kind of mental phenomenon that warns Peter of all forms of danger it is so much more than that.Peters canonically used his spidersense to be able to tell if someones carrying a concealed gun or not his spidersense doesnt just warn him of a threat directed at him but also directed at other people. While on patrol Peters spidersense will warn him if theres danger near and thats why he can respond to muggingstheftsheists so quickly.His spidersense gives him several hundredths of a second to register and recognize whatever danger is threatening him and his superhuman reflexes give him plenty of time to react to that threat accordingly.It varies from writer to writer but the spidersense has been able to warn Peter of danger even while hes unconscious allowing him to react and avoid said danger under the effects of sleep.Peter cant discern the nature of the threat from the spidersense alone bulletsbombspunches etc. he can however sense the severity of the danger a strong tingle of the spidersense will inform him that he needs to move quickly. A low buzz will tell him that the dangers nearby but isnt an immediate threat to him he has time to investigate.Its sort of inconsistent so a lot of people just interpret it however they want but its not nearly as precise as Matts radarsense. The spidersense is an extremely powerful ability Peters greatest arguably but its not infallible it can be tricked.The spidersense seems to operate on some kind of wavelength which is evident as Peter uses that same wavelength to detect his spidertracers. But that wavelength can be exploited a strong enough signal can override the spidersense or as evidenced by recent history get rid of it altogether.Matts radarsense is a combination of his superhuman senses combining to form a picture of the world around him he cant use his eyes so he needs his other senses. Peters spidersense has nothing to do with his five senses its completely independent of him and operates on its own.Bottom line Peters spidersense can help him navigate places its the reason he can fire weblines wherever he wants in the city without looking his spidersense guides his aim to spots safe to swing from but its not as effective as Matts radarsense in that regard.,Marvel,d5y8wge,17,t5_2r40o

8492033,0,t1_d62xiks,For a long time I only knew Deadpool from this Wolverine comic I had. The cover was Deadpool with Wolverine over his head skewered in his swords. It opens up with Deadpool and Wolverine fighting. Deadpool really puts the hurt on Wolverine and escapes. Wolverine gets a taxi but its going too slow so he used the roof as some kind of snowboard thing on pavement...Meanwhile Deadpool is hunting down Colossus and this blue girl who are both like drama actors? I remember this one girl complaining that the ketchup they use in place of blood is starting to attract flies. Theres one panel where the blue girl looks creepy. I think Colussus was trying to act and he goes YOU!! And she was like Yes! That sent chills down my spine but Colossus wasnt acting Deadpool had shown up!It was one of my favorite nonSpiderMan comics and it was my only exposure to Deadpool for a long time...

People keep bringing it up over and over again but it doesnt change that the best selling books were their most popular characters who mostly are white men.For the last few years marvel has basically been saying you want more black superheroes but dont want to buy books featuring black superheroes? Fine well heres a black captain America. Oh you want more gay characters but dont want any new characters? Fine well now iceman is gay. More women despite our massive list of strong female heroes? Fine well make Thor a woman.Theyve been in a lose lose situation for decades regarding this issue and its mainly been people who dont pay attention to comics that have been causing them grief. So they do these outlandish things not just to get a shocking twist for readers but to generate publicity to the general public.You dont hear a lot about sexism in comics anymore. Instead its bitching about how pc theyve become. But soon enough things will revert back to normal but the criticisms will be fewer.

8615225,0,t1_d6ihpiv,Thanks.  He really was a nice guy but I have to tell you this conversation along with several others lately are really making me start to take stock of my life.This guy had happy vibrant life.  He was born and raised in rural GA but when he was younger he lived in Atlanta and was a construction manager.  He told me many stories about their lives and there were a lot of parallels to mine.I was born in a small farming town lived a fairly happy young life grew up moved to cities for work and then  years ago began a shift to the suburbs and then  years ago  to our dream place  a large horse farm in the country.  Im  with the medical problems of a yo.  Too many surgeries and damage from my younger carefree years.But Im still commuting to ATL for work.  I putting in  hour daily commutes plus long work days.  For what?  Ive made my money.  I have all I need.Now I look at this man and see someone that had a similar trajectory and now is tired broken and in pain.  Living his life pretty much locked inside his house.  What kind of life is that?So I guess in my rambling way Im saying is this what we all have to look forward to? and if it is then I DAMN WELL want to make the most of my next  years before that is my fate.,Marvel,d6ii1u3,12,t5_2r40o

Also it could explain so of the more extraordinary powers that dont feel natural per se. Cyclops XGene is influenced more by the Power Stone thus he has his optic blast. Rogues is influenced by the Soul Stone so she can absorb the life force and mimic the power of others. Xavier is influenced by the Mind Stone so he read and control minds.

8711699,0,t3_4yy7t2,The Vision is obviously a masterpiece and Tom King is the next Jonathan Hickman in my own humble opinion. HOWEVER...DC was smart as hell and hes now their exclusive writer so Marvel lost there big time. Was slightly disappointed by his first Batman arc but it definitely wasnt bad.I think the main problem I have with Marvel now is that they are letting Brian Michael Bendis pretty much running the show. He has too many important heroes in his hands and hes doing a horrible job at all of them.I used to love Guardians of the Galaxy during the Abnett amp Lanning era and I simply detest what Bendis is doing to them now. Same goes for his GENIUS idea of bringing back the s XMen. Ive only been following The Vision Deadpool DeadpoolSpiderMan and Scarlet Witch. The Avengers and the XMen books have currently no appeal to me at all and I used to be a huge fan so I hope people can understand my disappointment with those books.

Comic decompression storytelling doesnt lend itself well to floppies as much as it does to trades which is why some people trade wait or read the whole story when its done.If you have trouble with the new characters I suggest you go back and reread the whole thing once its done but if youre finding out that you arent enjoying the story very much then yeah just drop out.For me its OK my friend buys it and I read it from him but the comic itself its not a must buy for me.

They try to regroup but a second wave of terrigen mist mysteriously appears and wipes most of the mutants out and even cyclops is affected which is why you see him falling over unconscious in one of those panels.

8905672,0,t3_524mca,The flaw in the debate is this after his experience with Jean Cyclops made up his mind to try and use the Phoenix and even as he states here that it killed Charles and not him...his plan was to have a teenage girl wield it.  Even worse this cosmic force that has eaten suns and destroyed planets is on its way to earth and his response to everyone else is  We got it...butt out.  My biggest issue with Cyclops was this he was a good field commander who spent too much time placing his hopes and dreams in the vision of one person. When he found that person wasnt pure he still went looking for something to save mutants regardless of the danger.  Once the mutants returned he didnt go full Magneto or Professor X.  Instead his stance was like the drunk guy at the bar that keeps announcing hell beat up anyone that wants to try him...which eventually will make someone try him. He also managed XForce poorly.  Rahne Sinclair? Warpath? Those guys werent killers.  I thought a good move would have been to keep the XMen as they were and have the XForce team Wolverine assembled do dirty work.    What most bothered me was him putting kids in a position to kill Oya despite him never being a killer and spending years hating that Wolverine was.  At its base I saw it as him losing faith in Xavier and then wanting to rebel in a sense...but he still had the examples of Magneto and he felt he couldnt be that...so he just kind of hovered in a nebulous area demanding something from others that he never did.  By contrast Wolverine has killed plenty of people but you cant find examples of him trying to convince others to kill.  Hes actually had numerous examples of applauding or out right stopping younger members from killing.   Cyclops biggest issue IMO was that he never had a life outside the XMen.  When that fell apart he did as well. Even worse near the end of the incursions his solution was...Ill become Phoenix again...cause that worked out well before.,Marvel,d7ibzp9,4,t5_2r40o

I like this thing thats going on with Deadpool that he is questioning himself and everything that happens at the same time. I feel that he is just telling jokes at this point out of habit or necessity that those around him expect. Kinda like how SpiderMan explained that his joke telling was his way of stress relief or fear. Of course hes still a comical guy but hes never going to be the same because he has responsibilitys and things to care about which some inevitably will come crashing down. SpiderManDeadpool seems like his guys night out since when he is with SpiderMan he can relate to in multiple ways and kinda open up while having fun. Idk Im rambling. ,Marvel,d7p08ly,5,t5_2r40o

This is due to the force of.the shotgun pushing him back knocking his brain around inside his skull while his skin was fine.

There was a big section for Disney Infinity with a focus on the Marvel characters. amp a decent sized Marvel merchandise store including a bunch of new  issues of comics and trade paperbacks.Its not the most in your face section of the park but if youre looking for it its not hard to find.

9195250,0,t3_569f14,Reading comics is a lot simpler than it seems at first. Comics writers are pretty good at telling stories that take place in a large shared universe but dont require you to have read a bunch of other comics to understand or enjoy them. Most writers focus on telling their own stories and explain everything you need to know within the story itself.When you start reading comics dont worry about timelines and that kind of thing. Treat each story like its own individual universe. The more stories you read the more you will see how everything fits together.If you want to get into Marvel heres some good recentish stuff I recommend checking out Iron Man by Matt Fraction vol.  The Five Nightmares Captain America by Ed Brubaker vol.  The Winter Soldier Thor God of Thunder by Jason Aaron vol.  The God Butcher Indestructible Hulk by Mark Waid vol.  Agent of SHIELD Hawkeye by Matt Fraction vol.  My Life as a Weapon Black Widow by Nathan Edmondson vol.  The Finely Woven Thread Avengers by Kurt Busiek vol. Any one of these is a good place to start with the Marvel Universe. I would recommend checking your local library first they may have a lot of these available to check out. Id also want to let you know that Marvel has a digital subscription service called Marvel Unlimited which has every comic I just mentioned available to read for just month or year. Its a real good deal.,Marvel,d8hkdjc,3,t5_2r40o

9267680,0,t1_d8o8p0s,Im not really sure how I feel about this. The dialogue is really ... I dont like it lets leave it at that. I went in with out any prior knowledge cause thats just how I like to start things but idk I was hoping for a new hero with some new origin story but got another inhuman. Theres nothing wrong with inhumans its just that its kinda seeming lazy. Why make an origin story when you can just say the Terrigen mist showed up and now super hero. And if Marvel just wants more inhumans why not make a series following newly reborn? inhumans rather than have  about heroes who are just inhumans.That being said. The power is really cool and there arent main main characters with this type of power from what I recall at least. I feel like there is a lot of potential for just about anything with Mosaic and there are could be a lot of really cool paths for the authors to take especially in terms of character development. Overall though I have no idea where this is going which is sort of a good thing.

Youve got the cosmic the sad tale he goes  through his wanted to help people and trying to stumble through that life his family and everything that goes with.  .

Had I stayed at my old company I would have been more fucked. I worked retail for  years and I know an absolute ton of people that work retail. I keep in touch with my old employees at my store. They have been told if anyone goes over  hours they will be written up.  write ups and their gone. Ive heard the same thing from people working for at least ten different retail companies. People that work in the service industry like retail food service call centers etc. positions that are typically low paying and require terrible hours to begin with are going to be fucked by this legislation. Most companies look at employees as a cost and nothing more. Most but not all companies with people making low enough salaries to actually fall under the threshold treat employees as replaceable. There are companies that will do right by their employees and allow overtime or lighten workloads to keep them under . A good majority will not and people will lose their jobs or illegally work off the clock to keep their job under the threat of termination. ,Marvel,d9my3q2,0,t5_2r40o

9597917,0,t1_d9w3an4,As far as funny goes The Unbelievable Gwenpool is currently on top of my list. Its clever and the art is vibrant and beautiful. Theres a  issue which gives you the introduction to the character and is still ongoing.Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is another fun book but its definetely not for everybody. And the art is an quired taste as well Its frankly something I have to put up with because I like the writing. Id say maybe check it out see if you fancy it.Old Man Logan is probably the epithome of tragic and dark so you have that covered with his current ongoing.On a similar vein I suggest The Vision its a  issue series that just ended a few weeks ago. Youll see high praise for it everywhere you look and its not undeserved.AS a fellow fan of Civil War  Id like to suggest Captain America Steve Rogers also still ongoing. THe only problem with that is that it does kind of assumes you have some past knowledge. You can always ask around if you dont understand something but I say that the only thing that you should need to read as a background is the Standoff event.SpiderMan is fun because theres like  of them. Theres probably one you enjoySpiderMan is Miles Morales ongoing. Personally not my favourite but it does has its moments and it ties in with Civil War  quite  lot so you might enjoy it for the extra expositionAmazing SpiderMan is good old Peter Parker. Currently theres a bit of n event called The Clone COnspiracy going on which might be confusing to jump in due to how much its actually using from past stories. one of those being...Superior SpiderMan often described as the best Spider Man run from the last few years. This one is over and done though.SpiderManDeadpool you might enjoy. Its just like the title describes a team up book starring Spidey and Deadpool. Its real a real fun ongoing.The extended family also includes Silkgirl who was also bitten by the radioactive spider and spent the last  years hidden in a bunker because of it SpiderGwenA story set in an alternate universe where Gwen Stacey was the one bitten by the spdier instead of Peter and Spider Man Miguel OHara the Spider man of the year  stuck in the presentIm afraid most of my suggestions dont lean to the tragic and dark side since thats not usually what I look for. I also mostly suggested ongoing or at least recent reads because thats how I started.

9641244,0,t3_5d2te9,Tom Taylor Dennis Hopeless and Cullen Bunn are all good at what they do. I hope they carry over in some form and that their stories are part of ResurreXIon in some way. Lemire is a good writer but man his Extraordinary has been underwhelming at best and irritating at worst. His character voices at best are bland at worst wildly inaccurate see Storm suddenly shifting with no explanation from decades long confidant leader of the Xmen to aw gee idk if I can do this stuff leadership is hard sad emoji. People keep bringing up Ewing and good lord that would be incredible but it feels like hes focused right now on the Great Big Story that hes been telling since Mighty Avengers which I assume is going to be the next Hickmanstyle yearslongbuiltupEpic. Id love for the Xmen to be a part of his huge story but I also dont want him to be forced into corners of the MU that he doesnt think fit and I also dont want the Xmen to be unnecessarily dragged into events. I like Nick Spencer too but his strength is imo humor titles. He might be work on one of the teen books or honestly on Iceman. Antman was a really really well balanced book between its goofy protagonist and his really personal serious journey. Chip Zdarsky or Ryan North would of course be golden in the humorbook arena too. If Chris Hastings has free time with Dr. McNinja wrapping up his longshot mini was golden. Ive been waiting for him to get more mainstream work. G Willow Wilsons Adjectiveless was the best run of the LadyTeam and Id love to see her get to write some of those characters again especially if Alist ladies like Rogue and Kitty are useable. Bennett would be really and truly wonderful but her stuff is just too dang niche to take off. Very few people really got the weird realitywarping meta satire that was Angela. They just focused on a few out of context panels and either condemned or celebrated the series based on that. That would almost certainly happen again. Kelly Thompson wrote some great Xladies in AForce. But man the one Xvoice Im missing above all else is Si Spurrier. Dude writes an amazing comic. XMen Legacy XClub and XForce were all an absolute blast really smart and really fun. He also seems to very much enjoy hyperviolence and that sort of comic has been absent from the postSecret Wars Xlineup. Old Man Logan hits some of those beats but its far too melancholy.

Even though the Amadeus Cho stuff was quite good I can go other places to read that. That being said I think it makes sense that two characters that have taken on two of the most important mantles in all of comics especially within the marvel universe would have to meet the allnew version of a problem that every superhero has had to deal with flaming skull motorcycle man. Even though Johnny Blaze is absolutely still out there as THE active Ghost Rider for at least this country or continent I forget the specific rules from the Heavens on Fire story.I dont think Robbie had enough time to show off his Ghost Riding as a result of all the hulk stuff but what he did get to do was quite awesome so it won me back over. Im looking forward to more cool Ghost Rider stuff and I feel like theres a good chance they work out the ChoAllNew Wolverine stuff in a way that doesnt just seem like they put two popular characters in a series theyre not sure will sell well otherwise.

For example I could imagine that the bone above the joint has evolved to handle more lateral stress and weightbearing but not as much sharp impact since that is shockabsorbed by the foot ankle and knee to some extent and therefore more microfractures or inflammation would occur.I had not considered stairs though.

What I get from his story is that as much as he may desire to settle down work on his art maybe have a family theres something in his mind that wont let him back down from the fight. Its kind of how the spidersaying goes With great power comes great responsibility Steve cant stop fighting as long as he is able to. Even when he was drained of his serum he dedicated his life and his mind to the world and to SHIELD and then did the one thing he could with his shield without throwing it and that was passing it on to the next generation and perhaps the man he believed the world needed to see as Captain America. Cap is forever a soldier thats what makes him great tragic and even terrifying if he switches sides.,Marvel,dbae10q,7,t5_2r40o

10083322,0,t3_5k6mct,The thing about comic book events are that though the essence of the event may be similar to that of their MCU counterparts they tend to involve a lot more characterspast storylinescrossovers so it may be a little overwhelming to jump straight into them. And its okay thats totally understandable. For starters if youd like to explore Hydra Cap I would recommend you read the crossover event Stand Off then move on to Spencers Captain America Steve Rogers run. Stand Off is a wellliked simple cleancut event thats relatively recent and Captain America Steve Rogers will follow the events of Stand Off.If youre also looking for pretty recent books on MCU characters Id recommend Matt Fractions run of Hawkeye. Its a must must must read and captures the essence of Clint Barton so perfectly. The ongoing Doctor Strange run is also solid though the art may be a little different from the MCU Doctor. For the Avengers as a team Hickmans Avengers run is universally recommended but it involves a lot more characters than the classic MCU set. Youll find that not only are there multiple Avengers divisions their members have also shifted over time. The recently concluded Tom Kings run of Vision is also legendary. Its really really good. And itll help you transition into the current Champions run which is kind of a younger version of Avengers thats also really popular. Could I also point you to XMen First Class? Its a modern retelling of the original five XMen team members basically a summary of past events and I think its a great place to get started with the XMen universe as well. I personally loved it.

When the book launched it was a major marketing point. It isnt delivering. The only difference between the Champions and the Avengers is how many pompous speeches the team makes after defeating the villain. Oh and the number of twitter hashtags involved. This issue the Champions get shot down and captured by Atlanteans. What have the Atlanteans been doing in the wake of Namors death? Has Atlantis been rebuilt since its destruction in Infinity? Do Atlanteans have territorial conflicts with other nations? Why are they so hostile? Is it a misunderstanding or their usual policy? Beats the shit outta me cause the Champions treat the Atlanteans as expendable mooks drain the water out of their ship and flee without making sure theyre not dead. Will the Champions return to check on the helpless women they saved from Islamic extremists? Nope! They have a Gwenpool crossover coming up no time for all the little people left behind.....oh wait....TLDR Waid boasted about how Champions would help the people left behind in the wake of superhero conflicts and them wrote a totally average book.....except for the bragging and twitter hashtags. ,Marvel,dbznpo9,14,t5_2r40o

10250482,0,t1_dc5wldc,Carol made one misstep the whole event lmao. The incident with the innocent woman was a mistake another vision most likely manipulated by Steve Rogers after all he is tied closely with Hydra. Kidnapping Ulysses was incredibly stupid especially when he had zero proof kidnapping the kids was the get proof. Carol was trying to keep peace the whole event within the means of Shields lawful reach. Tony kidnapped an Inhuman and brought an army to shieldss doorstep. Then put on the War Machine armor with the intention to fight Carol explain to me how those actions were Captain Americas doing? He was manipulating Tony but that doesnt excuse his moronic decisions. The only people who left Carols side were the Inhumans who now had way more to deal with in their own ranks and Black Panther which hurt since he and Carol were close. Everything Tony got was definitely for nothing but he was the cause of it being for nothing! Had he not acted like a psychopath and more peaceful and scientific resolution could have possibly been established. Instead Tony believed amassing an army was the better move and attacking Carol when she went to speak with Spiderman and Cap. I cant understand how you think Carol was written like an animal she was simply written as a hero doing her best to try and keep the peace and prevent possible tragedies. Meanwhile Tony was written like a loon who couldnt formulate a compete sentence and then got his teeth kicked in. ,Marvel,dc5y5nd,2,t5_2r40o

10399673,0,t1_dcmtzgq,His flaw is that he is really cocky and runs into things without thinking. Hes TOO enthusiastic about being the Hulk. Thats why he has his sister whom he often doesnt listen to anyway but she at least tries to keep him balanced and focused on the overall goal. Example from the latest issue Note that he isnt broken like Banner is. The story is a lot like the Superheavy arc that DC did when Gordon took over as Batman for awhile. Gordon didnt cry about his parents dying because thats not his motivating factor. How each character approaches having and using the superpower is the interesting story when they do character swaps like this because how every person would approach having a superpower is different...

Anyone who doesnt want to know should skip this comment.Its not explicitly stated what exactly happened to the mutants just that the Reavers and in particular Richard E. Grants character were in some way responsible though not intentionally. Mutants arent extinct in the film just very rare.Logans powers slow down because hes old and because of the adamantium in his body. Its poisoning him but very slowly so while he is suffering from the effects hes not dying as such although it is mentioned it will probably kill him some day in the future. The stuck claw is near the beginning of the film Logan has to pull that one out manually.

11083060,0,t3_5y96v2,Thats who they cast for Valkyrie? Im getting a bad feeling. No its not because shes not white I dont care. Its because I can never take Tessa Thompson seriously in any role. Her acting always seems to be just north of soap operas. Even on Westworld I couldnt get into her acting. I REALLY hope Im wrong and I might be because Marvel is always spoton with casting. We need to see Valkyrie as an impressive powerful believable woman warrior instead of hot California girl pretending to be tough as I fear will be the case. She seems to be as bad a choice for Brunhilde as Gal Gadot is for Wonder Woman.Why is Hollywood afraid to cast women with muscle tone and lessfeminine features? Brunhilde should be STRONGlooking. She should look as big tough and muscular for a woman as Thor does for a man. She should look like she could bench press any normal man with ease and she should have chiseled features that border on handsome in the feminine sense. Yeah... Definitely not feeling that casting choice. I hope Im wrong. Ill give her a chance to impress but if its just the same character she always plays Ill be disappointed. I need to remind myself that these EW photo shoots almost always end up looking really cheesy. They never do ANY favors to the actors in costume. EW could make Iron Man look cheeseball and cheap so Ill hold out hope that this is bad EW photography and editing and not what well see on the screen. ,Marvel,deo96wb,6,t5_2r40o

11225344,0,t3_608h0y,IF is so boring my OH feel asleep halfway through the sixth episode. . people did shit on Luke cage its second half falls apart . people did shit on JJ it has pacing issues . season two of daredevil dips really bad in the middle But IF starts with all these issues and carries them on. Its written so poorly that even Clair is cringe inducing. There is nothing special about the cinematography to point to in terms of framing or lighting not a colour palette. They certainly was not interesting colour grading looks as grey and dull as the avengers No clever tinges of purple like in Jessica Jones or the framing her behind glass to show her separation or vulnerability. Luke was constantly framed with bars in shot to show the pending jail time. There is no tension DD gets hurt and I believe it none of that here. Fin Jones is so unconvincing as a martial artist I actually laughed out loud in the sixth episode. The worst thing about this is the Meechams dear God are they dull.

His nievity bordered on plain ditzy and unaware at times. I kind of see what they were trying for hes mentally regressed to the  yr old but I expected a much higher level of of mental balance maturity and wisdom from someone who championed the trials of Kunlun and is arguably one of the greatest martial artists on the planet.A powerful teenage mutant can have rage issues but it doesnt fit a hardened trained gifted martial artist.The character as portrayed is what I wouldve expected from him training as a teenager not established as the Ironfist. I wouldve much more preferred if he was wise beyond his years instead of an emotion dumpster fire reacting to environment without thought or self awareness.,Marvel,df6ld32,2,t5_2r40o
11245847,0,t1_df6okso,gtA good character doesnt have to be a likable one. Never said they did as youll notice I said I liked Fisk Killgrave and Mariah.  In fact you could add Kingpins wife to that list as well.  All of them frankly terrible people who I found far more interesting to watch than the younger Meachum.I understand what they were trying with Ward and it was exactly as you described I just didnt feel it totally worked.  It goes back to what I said with the entire show needing a solid second draft.  While they had a good idea of how to structure Ward they didnt pull it off in my eyes at least.  They had a good base to work off but they didnt cook it properly.  Ingredients were added at the wrong time things werent left to simmer the way they should have and while the final outcome was perfectly palatable it didnt reach the levels many of the other unlikable characters did.  That said hes at least far better than Diamondback...Once again if people like it it literally does not affect me or my take one bit so theyre welcome to like it as much as they want.  I have so many great comic book adaptations across film and television right now that I dont have to cry every time somethings not exactly to my liking.  Im still wonderfully excited to see Defenders and a big part of that will be getting to see Luke and Danny meet and become friends.  Nothing about this show was bad enough to make me think that interaction wont be great and if Im honest thats really what I wanted most from an Iron Fist show a character that was decent enough to stand beside Cage.  ,Marvel,df6p7gx,2,t5_2r40o

I thought that the scene of her and Cottonmouth ya know which one Im talking about could have been such a fantastic moment in show history but I feel as though she couldnt handle the character and the whole scene just came off as super corny and forced. After that episode I was so pissed that she was going to probably end up as the main villain that I stopped the show for about a week. I started back up because I felt I needed to give her the benefit of the doubt. But whenever she came on in the next episode I just cringed and couldnt take it so I just stopped watching the show.

In general for a show about Iron Fist vs The Hand it completely lacked magic and mysticism. It was like they were afraid to admit that yes magic is real. The Hand challenge was strange because of that attempt at realism. Like what were these russian guys? They seemed like random street thugs why call them specially to fight Iron Fist lol. The Bride of Nine Spiders was particularly terrible they tried to make it realistic I guess but all I kept thinking was her carefully hanging up the white sheets and putting fog on the floor to make it more spidery its like shes nesting...

11291940,0,t1_dfafnrp,ROUND ONE SYNOPSES PART IISomewhere...Attorney Murdock sensed something was off. He was keenly aware of his new surroundings through his four enhanced senses but unable to determine one important facet why. He determined that he was close to a familiar presence. Suddenly a door behind Daredevil exploded and through the wrecked doorway came a large man with a large weapon. And shots were fired.The blind hero sprung to action without fear with an impressive acrobatic display but then he felt a familiar tug at his mind. A telepath! As he had done many times before Murdock let the intruder into his mind welcoming him to overwhelming pain and confusion. Sensory overload! A result of the telepaths inability to conceive of Daredevils heightened senses.Kick after kick after kick sent the attacker reeling back against what was left of the doorframe but the Man Without Fear came to realize his attacks were futile. He knew it he knew it as soon as that huge arm grabbed him around the neck. Not an ordinary arm. Not belonging to an ordinary man. But before Murdock could say a word the fight was over and the mutant called Cable was the victor.RESULT  Cable d  DaredevilSomewhere else...Wolverine figured it out first but Hawkeye figured it out best.As they separately came to realize the truths about their shared situation they naturally took their own approaches to it. Wolverine a traditionalist preferred to settle things with fists. Or worse.Aw. Bro. Arent you going to give me a chance? Clint lamented.And so they came to grounds for an agreement and what they agreed to was a drinking contest. Clint produced two bottles from his quiver with a knowing glance. RESULT  Wolverine d  HawkeyeAnd somewhere else...The battle if it could be called such a thing was fought without so much as a twitch of a finger. Thats how these things are handled by mutants with the tremendous psychic and telekinetic abilities of Jean Grey. The XMens founding female knew from experience that the mind of Natasha Romanov had been manipulated controlled twisted and experimented upon more than an average Avenger. She expected some safeguards she predicted a struggle. But when someone with the tremendous psychic and telekinetic abilities of Jean Grey sets out to mentally overpower an individual she usually succeeds.As a courtesy after the ordeal was through Jean allowed Natasha to enjoy pleasant thoughts as she slept and removed her memories of the incident altogether.RESULT  Jean Grey d  Black WidowAnd at one other place...Bishop the mutant bounty hunter from the future checked his time displacement device as he ran hoping he is not too late. But for what? He didnt know. Something was pushing him and he was determined.In his haste Bishop tripped and came to find that it was not a clumsy effort but rather  a chain grasping his leg and tangling him like a snake. Suddenly he was flung back and forth in the air and he struck the ground and was tossed upwards again and finally crashed to a rest on the hood of what appeared to be a car. Struggling he could make out a figure coming towards him. A rider skull ablaze dragged the chain engulfed in flames. Bishop reached for and fired his weapon hitting the rider square in the chest barely slowing him. Taking a different approach Bishop turned his weapon toward his own chest and unloaded. As the rider reached for him Bishop pulled him close unleashing his stored energy in a concussive blast sending both flying. Stumbling to his feet the mutant time traveler realized he was nearly out of options. As he watched the rider rise and approach again Bishop spoke into his temporal communication device Send me back ten minutes. In a flash back on the run the mutant bounty hunter from the future thought he had put himself in a situation he could handle. He sprinted in an opposite direction than before planning to gain an advantage but within moments he realized he had made a huge mistake. Something had gone wrong. He was not where he thought he would be. This wasnt ten minutes ago.He saw things he did not expect he would see. He saw the demon he knew only as Mephisto handing a man on his knees a letter  a contract. With the last of his energy a collapsing Bishop unleashed an energy blast in their direction. As he drifted in and out of consciousness in this weird unknown place he remembered Mephisto standing over his body. With an evil grin the demon displayed the letter  the contract  with Bishops bloody hand print upon it. Had he won? And why? And at what cost?RESULT  Bishop d  Ghost Rider,Marvel,dfbxbgb,2,t5_2r40o

It just doesnt make sense to me to have a strong opinion on it. There was a clash of egos Kirby left and Lee insulted him. Just about everything else is speculation. Comparing their solo works is silly whatever happened later on cant prove the nature of what came out of a moment of team work. It may be that Kirbys later work benefited from his previous time with Lee. It may be that Lee was tremendously talented but worked best in collaborative enviroments. We dont know.

11385809,0,t1_dfmjjud,Just because its understandable for a teenager to do certain things doesnt mean it is the right direction for teen Spidey. Teen Spidey however is an arrogant hothead. This also happens to be a trait many teenagers would share I would agree he is trying to be heroic but his motivation for being disobedient shouldnt be to prove himself to anyone. As for Peter looking up to Cap that is also true. Despite this teen Peter would most likely not take kindly to any command under others even someone like Cap. Even if it would make sense for him to do so I would still remain adamant that that is an improper direction for the character. His core concept is being relatable to any everyday person and receiving the gadgets and teachings of a billionaire playboy is not exactly relatable its a direction the character should go in. This movie shouldnt be about Iron Man and SpiderMan relationship and dynamic it should be about SpiderMan. IMHO the best part of this movie is probably gonna be after Tony takes away Peters suit.,Marvel,dfmk8vt,1,t5_2r40o

11529060,0,t1_dg2oqan,My issue is that this sort of tone doesnt mesh well IMO with the underlying story. This is supposed to Ragnarok the Fall of the Gods and End of the World. Sure it looks like Asgard is going to get rekt. But it shouldnt be a lighthearted affair. This is the destruction of Thors home his people and the main stablizing power in the galaxyuniverse.It would have been IMO far stronger to have gone less GOTG and more Winter Soldier. You can still have comedic moments to lighten the mood but maintain the gravity of whats going on.Also this movie seems like itll suffer from the Spiderman  syndrome  trying to cram too much into one film. This movie looks like itll basically be Ragnarok smashed with Planet Hulk not to mention if they do mix in the Guardians into things plus whatever tiein to the Infinity War.Im very mixed in terms of this movie.

I got to ask him a question in the QampA thing as well and after when my brother and I got to take a picture with him it was just us three and the photographer and two security guys and he had been talking and taking pics at this point for hours. Anyway we are behind the walled off booth thing with just him and my brother out of the hearing range of thousands of others and he was so damn nice and chatted with us and did the same poses my brother and I did and he thanked me for my question earlier and I told him how I was there as a surprise from my older brother for my birthday and he shook our hands and said Well happy birthday young man. What a great bond you and your brother have...enjoy your day and I hope this old man helped to make it a good one! And he was so fucking sincere and nice and I was just floored with how amazing of a guy he was. About  hours later it was my turn to get my comic signed and he looks up at me and says Hey!! Its BirthdayMan! Still having a great day? And I said Sir youre the best...I mean that... and he goes Thank you so much...Now youve made my day even better... and afterwards my brother and I got hammered in the bar they had there and couldnt stop talking about it hahaha. We still talk about it a good amount and we each have the pics framed in our houses. Literally the most genuine and sincere man Ive ever met.ALSO after my brother and I were talking to other people there how awesome it was to meet him an older gentleman told us how the last time he saw Stan Lee at a comic con it was the end of the convention and the guy had lost his keys and Stan Lee was literally walking back to the limohotel room or wherever and stopped helped this guy look for his car keys and made his security guys help as well for a half an hour.

Keith Giffen who wrote Annihilation wrote this and.....while I wont say who else is featured in it he does call back to it at the beginning of Annihilation itself  plus its about Thanos and lays groundwork Giffen would continue in Annihilation.Everything else is just collecting what the various GOTG folks were doing in the couple years before Annihilation.

Then read Dan Abnetts Guardians  and after that Secret Wars Korvac Saga.Heck if they have the original Korvac Saga you should go ahead and read that too its basically a crossover between the Avengers and the original Guardians of the Galaxy. The Korvac Saga BTW was also what introduce James Gunn to the Guardians of the Galaxy so its a must read.Also pick up anything by Jim Starlin specifically Infinity Gauntlet Adam Warlock and Infinity Watch related comics.All of this will give you a big appreciation for some of the stuff James Gunn has done in the GotG and GotG vol  and it will make you appreciated Cosmic Marvel more.,Marvel,dglgp4k,2,t5_2r40o

For example in the new Infinity War movies Im assuming that at some point Thanos gets a hold of all  stones and puts on the Gauntlet.  The very instant that he does this he should just wink or snap or whatever and bing Avengers are all wiped from existence.  Bingo no one to challenge him he wins.  All over and done with roll credits.I get it that this doesnt make a great story that writers cant have that happen so that there can be a satifying ending to the story BUT if thats the case then why make an artifact thats supposedly ALL powerful instead of just REALLY powerful?Edit  Yeah everyone I know he defeats himself through various personality flaws.  This is some of my point.  Having a tool grant omnipotence forces the writer into a corner in which this is the ONLY way out of this situation.

11786842,0,t3_68489r,Hi Gerry thanks for the AMA. I must admit I dont really read your comics other than some of your earliest Deadpool stuff but how youve been talking about your respect and love for grand cosmic adventure really has grabbed my attention. Not that I dont buy enough comics every week anyway but whats one more?My question is how do you feel about the constant tieins from seemingly more than  of Marvels books? No one thing has driven me away from reading Marvel books more than tieins to events that I couldnt care less about. I get the sense that you have some say in whether your books get hooked into an event but even when you make an effort to merely pull relevant story threads into your books I still cant help but feel like Im missing something. What gives? How can we signal to Marvel as readers that I would buy so many more books if they werent being constantly interrupted?,Marvel,dgw2t65,3,t5_2r40o
