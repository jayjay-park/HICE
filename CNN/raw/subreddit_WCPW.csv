I certainly understand why they want their ondemand feature to be a component of Extra to try to gain more paying members  but I worry it will have the opposite effect.  I was very much considering becoming a subscriber but was waiting for them to add more content and fix their technical issues to justify the expense.  Making the free content harder to watch weektoweek means I wont catch episodes of Loaded and sadly that makes me less enthusiastic about the product.,WCPW,dcrjtji,1,t5_3esa9
