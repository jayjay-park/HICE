131673,0,t1_cetfd2u,Heres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about The lady doth protest too much methinks  gtThe quotation The lady doth protest too much methinks. comes from Shakespeares Hamlet act III scene II where it is spoken by Queen Gertrude Hamlets mother. In Shakespeares time protest meant vow or declare solemnly. The context is a play within a play and the Queen criticizes the Player Queens speech on the grounds that excessive avowal of her plan to not remarry after the Player Kings death sounds hollow and insincere. Today protest means declare an objection so the phrase has come to mean that one can insist so passionately about something not being true that people suspect the opposite of what one is saying.Pictureimage source | about | ujsnen can reply with delete.

10638808,0,t3_5s7zub,In science Hypotheses are predictions or educated guesses about the relationship of specific aspects of phenomena the relationship of those things. Hypothesis The path of light coming from distant stars is affected by massive objects.  For a long time that was a working hypothesis. It is now a tested confirmed true hypothesis.  That particular gravitational phenomenon is called gravitational lensing.      A theory attempts to explain those phenomena. The theory says why the hypothesis is true. The Theory of Gravity explains gravity. ToG comprises among other things a mathematical  physical model of how and why gravitational lensing occurs.  In philosophy its a little different. The counterpart to hypotheses are premises statements or propositions from which other may be inferred or necessarily follow.  Lets use Platos Theory of Forms as our example here. The ToF attempts to to explain among other things how the world can appear to be both permanent and changing. Why does it appear both ways?  The first premise of his ToF goes We believe that the more objective a concept is the more real the thing it represents.  He then adds another premise and reason from them.  In logic a premise is something else. The classic example is Premise  all men are mortal.  Premise  Socrates is a man.  From which we conclude because both  premises are true  that Socrates is mortal.  Theses are arguments. My masters thesis was an argument about a certain mathematical relationship.  John Deans thesis in his book Conservatives Without Conscience is that the Republican Party of today is dominated by authoritarian personalities both leaders and followers. ,logophilia,dddb84m,1,t5_2rt1y
