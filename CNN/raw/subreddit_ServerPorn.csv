1397207,0,t1_cir7jk9,Mate I cant give the kit a big enough rap yes its commodity hardware and yes its not as cheap as you may hope but it is worth every cent.The Nutanix Operating System and the intelligence it contains that allows for hardware parity and data localisation is gold.I have done full cluster upgrades in place without any effect on the production environment and without a single user noticing.  Having a cluster really brings a lot of flexibility with it in terms of not having to take the environment offline to maintain it.I retired  SANS with this roll out there was no agonising over how to layout the datastore all resources form a single bucket you can carve up on the fly as you see fit and the best part when I want more storage I just add another node and then the cluster will make that storage available to me without me having to do anything.Just to give you a couple of quick facts I have  VMs on that cluster including all my desktops and server like SQL  ERP.We replaced  RU of physical servers with  RU of Nutanix.  Dropped from a base load of  Amps to  Amps.,ServerPorn,cirf5oz,8,t5_2sb9o

1983155,0,t1_cks3abt,Mix of both but being an academic environment its really just beginner stuff thats why we went with the K cards. While at VMworld there were a lot of engineering firms that are currently utilizing GRID cards for VDI environments to make their software available out in the field and to secure their project files. uiaindings would be able to help a lot too with any questions. I suspect ours should have no trouble handling what our studentsfaculty can throw at it once its fully deployed.,ServerPorn,cks65oc,1,t5_2sb9o

4235106,0,t1_cs2xic1,Just because it was patched does not mean the patch is active.  The reason is in how LinuxUnix handles files.Take Glib for example its the core library for all Linux programs which are not statically linked.  If you have a program which has a library file open with version A and you update to version B the program will continue to use A until it closes the file handle used to open the library.  In addition the disk space taken up by A will not be freed until the file handle used to open the library is closed even though it has been unlinked deleted.  There is a plugin for YUM which will tell you which old files are still opened by programs.Heres another example say you have a box which has a remote exploit vulnerability in sshd allowing any attacker full root access.  Lets say you then patch sshd but dont restart sshd youre still potentially at risk depending on where the vulnerability is.  If the vulnerability lies in the portion of sshd which spawns new processes per connection youre vulnerable but if its in the spawned portion then youre safe as each newly spawned process will use the newly patched library.Things can also get more complex if Version A of application expects to use version X of a shared library but when you update to version B of the application and Y of the library the currently running A may have trouble when it tries to open library Y this is assuming it does not keep the file handle open.,ServerPorn,cs2zoh0,3,t5_2sb9o

5023313,0,t1_curhcki,Ah. Thanks for that video  Im about to start it from the beginning and watch the whole thing. What Im getting from it right now though is that your finer movement is still of the character within the universe and its only when you stray too far from the scenes origin that the universe shifts on its own separate scale and it pops you back to the origin of the local scene. Is this reasonably accurate?Also the single vs doubleprecision causes a different problem from what I thought before. Its not a matter of the GPU being able to render more efficiently but simply being able to render it more precisely which would change the image.,ServerPorn,curi138,3,t5_2sb9o
