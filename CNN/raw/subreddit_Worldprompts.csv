3517311,0,t3_30k13y,The wrinkles on the mans forehead folded up as he smiled teeth showing as the corners of his mouth twist up. He laughs and places a hand over his head pointing down at the short round hat. This old thing? he asks eyes closing as he gives another chuckle that echoes through the room. His skin is light brown with a tint of red that makes him almost like as if hes been kissed by the sun. The younger man glares his tightly buttoned coat straining just a bit as he sits more upright. Yes just tell me why you wont take the hat off. Do you have something hidden under it?Oh why do you think Im hiding something? You refused to take your hat off and you cant wear it in your entry ID. Thats the law.The old man chuckles again placing a hand on his hat. The young man in uniform raises a lighthaired eyebrow his mouth in a frown. His skin is lightly tanned and his sharp brown eyes pierce the old mans gaze as he waits. I suppose I suppose. If thats the law that is.He pulls the hat off revealing a perfectly normal head of black hair. He flips it upside down and holds it with both hands on the brim. The young man looks down at the hat where a small baggy sits. Recognition fills his eyes as he looks at the small crystals and he flushes slightly.I didnt see a thing sir he says as he raises the camera. You just give me a smile and youll get your visa for entry to Alleghany. Youre coming in from the Republic of Yuropa right?The man laughs and nods. The young man snaps the portrait and puts his hat back on. As the young man leaves to develop the photo he places his hands in his pockets. He wraps his fingers around a small retractable knife and follows behind the young man just before the door to the photo development room closes.,Worldprompts,cpt7729,2,t5_37jsn

3521974,0,t3_30mbdo,Because you havent learned how to see the rest.We live in a world of seven dimensions but we only exist in these  three dimensions of space and one of time. We know there are others because people smarter than you or I have counted them I take it that math checks out. The Super Seven are dimensional avatars. Think of them like nesting dolls  the th dimension encompasses the previous three and the th dimension encompasses the previous four. The Super Seven are the same way  each is a sort of superior to the previous. But heres the rub while they answer to next guy up theyre restricted to their own dimensional space.That is why you and I only see three the first three to be exact.gtBut wait you said we live in four dimensions  three of space and one of time?Yes exactly. We live in the fourth dimension. Hasnt it ever made you wonder why we can see space but not time? Time is invisible to us because we are inside it. Take the nesting doll example again  you cant see the nth doll of the set when you are inside it. It works the same way with time and our dimensions we cant visualize time as anything other than cheap metaphors because we are its subjects under its control and shackled by its rules. Super Four is a dimensional avatar of time and therefore exists outside of it. We cant see whats outside of our dimension.gtBut you can learn?Not me no. Im too old for that. You can though.gtSo...hang on if Super Four is outside of the th dimension then logically that means that Super Seven is outside of the th dimension right? But you said there are seven total. How can he be outside of the last dimension?Thats crazy talk son. Do you want to learn physics or philosophy?,Worldprompts,cptqbce,10,t5_37jsn

3539170,0,t3_30swsx,Well as the tale goes there was a young man by the name of Ikazel who was the leader of a small but famous group of thieves that inhabited the area around Bardlestown. Ikazel was a kind of a legend around the town it was said no one had ever caught him stealing. Now one day during the Bleeding Dragon Festival Ikazel walked into a bakery which was a central point in town as it duelfunctioned as a bar. It was especially crowded today due to the festival. Ikazel casually reached for a loaf of bread preparing to slip it under his coat. A flash of silver later he found his arm lying in front of him.The crowd went silent and all eyes fell on the cloaked man standing to Ikazels right. The man reached for his hood pulling it back slowly. This man was Haeln a traveling adventurer famous for slaying the three chimeras and reclaiming the golden sandscroll from the Nyrubaght ruins. It is said that Ikazel his arm cut clean off had sat down in awe and shock. The crowd began to cry for Haeln to chop off his head too for Ikazel had a reputation as being cruel and twisted. But Haeln seeing through the stories and into Ikazels eyes saw that he was no more than a bored kid. Haeln extended his hand and grasping Ikazels good hand pulled him up onto his feet. Ikazel seeing that he had been bested swore his loyalty to Haeln then and there. He swore to follow him wherever his adventures led and to defend Haeln with his life. Ikazel went on to become one of the most famous battlethieves in the land building up a reputation that rivaled even Haelns own. And that is why we begin every story with It began with a slice of bread and a severed hand ever since. ,Worldprompts,cpvoruf,1,t5_37jsn

3577617,0,t3_31ame2,Well you cant literally turn into a dragon but you can become a highly ranked demon just like a dragon or a wraith.First you have to become a demon. There is only one way to do that which is to acquire a soulgem. With the soulgem you will be able to collect souls and insert their powers into your bodysoul. Be careful though as the soulgem can corrupt your mind. The possession of a soulgem may attract malicious spirits or ethereal demons ready to feed off of your feeling of power. You need to have a huge amount of selfcontrol and selfawareness to combat the corruption. Its advisable to already have a certain understanding of spiritual beings so you can recognize their influences. Also if you lose the soulgem you lose your power.After you collected enough souls and your power has greatly increased you will slowly turn into a demon. The corruption speeds up the process but also makes you lose your mind so its not advised.Youll know you reached the rank of a dragon or wraith when youve gained a remarkable amount of fame a badass title lived for more than a hundred years and people dont have the courage to disrespect you.Some famous dragonranked persons Maximillien the Wraith Knight Horlin the Soulslayer Ardhmor the Death Knight Silenis the Mute Forest yes the entire forest is a highranked demon. Its a little complicated. ect.If you want to become a wraith all you have to do is get the rank and die.You can also get a higher rank than that but it takes a lot more time and theres only one person known who could do that which is Warlord Drylon.,Worldprompts,cq02rhj,2,t5_37jsn

These are all dangers that will chill any veteran sailor to the bone and make him pray like a priest or cuss like the Plague itself. But. There is only one thing in all the Twelve Seas that will make that sailor either jump outright overboard without holding his breath or slice his own wrists with a rusty knife just to be sure. Peer into the eye of a typhoon during the Storming and you will find it staring right back at you. Never blinking never waning in intensity. Stare too long at it and you go mad madder than those hatters over in Anglekand. And thats saying a lot considering how bloody mad those bloody hatters can get. Bloody unnatural bunch of folk they are.

3703160,0,t3_32svby,If youre the intended recipient of an Abysm Pattern youll know immediately.Abysm Patterns look mostly abstract but with some recognisable forms or letters in them. A particular line might remind you of a childhood toy or of a piece of esoterica you know or it might just evoke an emotional response by its shape. The person who is meant to read it will recognise every part of the symbol and understand the intended message as a kind of metaphor relating all these parts together. Its quite a pleasant sensation some people describe it as a religious enlightenment.While metaminds can create Abysm Patterns with sufficient knowledge of their target they cannot read them directly. Hence they are the most secure code ever invented  decoded not by a password or a key but only by the brain structure of the reader.Variations have been attempted  patterns that can only be read by people of a certain ideology for example  but they produce a lot of false negatives. This does not stop the gullible from using them to test which of their compatriots really supports the cause.The danger is in examining a Pattern for too long. By design they appear as a puzzle and compel the viewer to solve them. If you think about one for long enough that you memorise it you can easily become obsessed with it and with anything that looks like a clue to cracking the puzzle. For example one widelyshared Abysm Pattern had elements that looked like the Topatech logo causing an inexplicable interest in products associated with that logo. This was an accident on Topatechs part but its why you shouldnt forward Abysm Patterns to random strangers.,Worldprompts,cqedva9,5,t5_37jsn

I spotted a gap between  gearheads and made a dash for it. Gunshots rang out but I made it. At first it seemed like it would work. As long as I kept moving Id be alright I could anticipate their actions better than they could react to mine. I dodged and weaved punching and shoving the ones in my way.

No not like this. I strained flesh against metal and moved my hand the last few degrees to point it at my chest. I fired the White Bullet engraved with a diamond. Bright light filled the room and condensed around me. The gearheads nearby were thrown across the room. I ran and as I ran the aura pushed everything in my way aside. Energy surged through my veins and I felt my cuts and scrapes heal. What a waste of such amazing power. I got to the door at the other end and realized those fucking clankers were still following me. I focused and the light surrounding me flowed into a wall penning them in and leaving me unprotected. Dammit that would have been really helpful. The wall would hold for about  minutes.

Avenues both groundlevel and elevated crisscrossed the city like the veins of an organism. The clouds were strungup in the sky like thin strands a bright and cheery Gtype star illuminated the whole sceneIn the middle of the city a mountain rose upward but not like any ordinary mountain. Gora Proroka was flanked on all sides by steep cliffs as if it were a pillar jutting from the gatedoff natural area below. It was the last refuge of true wilderness left in Edem and it was home to a group of monks who still swore by the Old Scriptures but today a heavy security detail was on patrol both inside the monastery and on the grounds outside of it.The crackling of radios and crunching of footsteps interrupted the painter his hand reflexively drawing back from the canvas his careful eye making sure not a single error was made on the section he was working on flicking one of his locks to the side as he glanced up at his subject.Emperor Jahnus sat on chair longsince concealed by the magnificent gilded cloak he wore shrouding his upperbody before draping over the side of the cushioned chair continuing on until it ended with a intricately patterned edge. He was young something the serums always tended to exemplify his short raven hair brushed backward the sides of his hair trimmed down. However what most drew the painters attention were his scars. The most advanced biotech in the world could only do so much and half of the incumbent Emperors face was draped in scartissue the left half of his face drooping down slightly as a result. This as an artist is what concerned him.Did he wear them with pride? A sign of perseverance? Was it something that built his inner strength or did it stoke the fires of his hatred for his enemies? Every detail mattered and even though this wasnt an abstract portrait by any means any minute thought he had into designing this would reflect in the final product.A demure smile crossed over the Emperors face possibly having a humorous or perhaps he had sensed the inner conflict of the painter.

It was used by the Jade Empress of Ystvar roughly  years ago and has since disappeared.  The scroll is enchanted with an illusion and a curse.  Any messages may be written upon it read read aloud and magically erased as many times as desired simply as a magical reusable scroll.  However upon the utterance of the scrolls magic word the current reader of the scroll will slowly be cursed to never see or hear another living creature ever again  they are still able to see the world around them and the affects of people and creatures around them and feel anothers touch but the people and animals are all silent and invisible to the cursed.  The scroll was used against the Jade Empresss own son after he turned traitor.  Over the course of a year his doctors and clerics tried to help him realize that they were still there and to find him a cure but were unsuccessful.  He slowly went mad over the following few years begging for scraps and affection but never able to keep another happy or remain happy himself for more than a day or two.  One of his doctors reported that the prince clawed his own eyes out rather than see a world bereft of life though he knew it was there.  After that he disappears from the records.    ampnbspThere are tales that it was used a second time on a village elsewhere in the Jade Empresss kingdom with a different magic phrase.

Water is falling in big but of varying size waterfalls from above downwards. At the lower end of the known cliff is a big and thick cloud layer which stretches in all directions to the horizon. There are also clouds which move along the cliff so that you get rainy days on varying heights.Here is a simple image illustrating itThere are ledgesplateaus of varying sizes all over the cliff many of them hosting villages settlements and castles.There is an extensive cavecavern system in the rock which spans the whole cliff and connects the ledgesplateaus with each other. This cavern system also has an infinite depth.The sun rises on the left side of the cliff and sets on the right side. At noon the sun is exactly opposite the cliff at roughly a  degree in the sky.

Weve come all the way from the Royal rivers sent by the high king himself to retrieve a mythical set of armor said to encase the wearer in streams of impenetrable water. Id think it nonsense if not for my own intrigue and the fate of the land depending on us. It is embroiled in civil strife and political distress due to the advances of Spivah and his zealot uprising. The court of officials are grasping at straws trying to quell them. So they have enlisted Mesala and I to endure this task of vast uncertainty.Truthfully? I could give a Drumands back end about the matter. Ive seen the inner workings of the court and the seeds of evil have long been planted within. Two sides of the same tonken except the incantations are the same on both sides. Of course this was of no consequence to our exalted king. Not when theres a tool of immeasurable power to be had or a prophecy and a warrior desperate enough to risk it all for his family. On the eve of the rd moon we reached our point of interest. A ruined castle high in the mountains of Zandalore. We were in the ancient kingdom of Zandelle the Shrouded. I dont know much about the ancients. Never was the scholar. Apparently he was tiny yet somehow had subdued a vast amount of land and one of the most enigmatic armies of his time. Some say he was deep in the ways of sorcery and that this afforded him unrivaled advantages over his enemies. Legendary items such as the liquid armour. Grimores with the most powerful spells rings of various enchantments. Yet like so many before and after his kingdom went as fast as it rose. No matter. What we need may lie here.Do you hear that? Mesala whispered.   Hear what? Its quiet as a silk rat here. I scoffed.   Mesala has many quirks and can be seen as many things but I know her. Have for a while now and while often a mage of sunny disposition she always knew when a situation was to become dire. She remains one of the most aware and intuitive elves i know.Your observation is firmly rooted in truth Biscuit but thats precisely the problem.   I looked at her provoking some form of elaboration.   Envoys of Zandele. They know were here. Theyve been waiting.   Not an instant after saying this as if right on cue the air around us chilled to an unnerving temperature. Winter? No..much colder and entirely different.It was as if every despair i could conjure up had manifested itself upon my being leeching away the very willpower to live. A sadness like no other hopelessness. Before i could even realize the enormity of my uselessness a soft gleam of blue light crept into the distance. It was warm and soothing like the beautiful days of harvest light back home. Mesala. Saving my ass yet again.Blessed Shal Biscuit! Compose yourself. We will not make it otherwise.   She had a ward completed in an instant. Thank Shal for her. I could feel my strenghth flowing from my pads shooting up my spine bursting out at the chest. Where are they?! I screamed.   Keeping her stare poised and focused straight Mesala answers   Look my dear warrior. Just before you. Zandelle lives!   As i gather myself Mesala illuminates the entirety of the ruined castle entrance. Her stave at the ready. I can see it all. Six envoys three on each side. They are clad in crimson armor with no headdresses. Their skin is smooth and scaly. Long silver hair pours from their hair like a majestic waterfall and with piercing eyes that glow red with hate they cut across the space threatening every thing i know. Zandelle is set atop a golden throne made from the darkest of magics. I cannot make out his likeness for he is surrounded by a dark shroud. It billows out like the poisonous gasses of Morispor. I dont want to breathe. I steele myself beside my precious mage but i am utterly surrounded by fear. Mesala notices and cuts me a most peculiar look. A look of complete terror and unyielding fascination.Prepare yourself she says we are to engage in the most magnificent of battles!  edit formatting,Worldprompts,d7ffy7a,2,t5_37jsn
