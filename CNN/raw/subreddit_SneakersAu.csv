I hate the idea but have you tried looking for resale on gumtree or eBay etc? I dont know what the resale is but it shouldnt be too crazy? Careful of fakes though they are getting pretty good. ,SneakersAu,d8lpiag,1,t5_3gu3v

10545350,0,t1_dd3f0qq,That is an interesting distinction. Although I do feel the same way. I think it comes down to the reason you value the items that establishes how you feel about replicasfakes. I like whiskey too primarily for the taste and sometimes the historystorysentiment that cant really be replicated. Same goes for watches I buy or admire them because of the craftsmanship quality and the time it takes to create a beautiful watch. The design can be copied but its still not the same.As for shoes I value them for the look and feel first sometimes the quality and sometimes the craftsmanship but that depends entirely on the shoe. If someone can replicate the things that are most important to me in these items I dont really see a problem with it. They are getting very good with the shoes too. I do have a problem with people acting superior in reps but acting superior in retails is pretty much just as bad. In reality theyre just shoes. ,SneakersAu,dd3flq1,2,t5_3gu3v
