3477106,0,t3_302o80,Are you positive youll be selling it in  years?  Maybe a lease yes those exist for the Corvette! might work out better?  Or finding a used one yourself?  s are readily available depending on where you are located.I just purchased my first new car as well though I intend to keep my Corvette for fingers crossed a normal  to  year lifetime.  Out of curiosity what would cause you to sell the car?  Though its a twoseater its still somewhat practical.  It has a decent amount of space is comfortable enough for daily driving and can even squeak out good highway fuel efficiency.I went with a GM credit union discount which I believe is close to your GM discount.  Youre correct that with that amount off MSRP your depreciation hit is a lot less and may be nearly absorbed by the discount.  Have you calculated your monthly payments on the vehicle?  I would expect that over  years and with that little mileage your depreciation in private party sale may be k or so.  MSRP on a  LT Z automatic in red is k.  So you can do the math and figure out just how much of a hit youd be taking.As far as options from what Ive heard the LT tends to be tougher to sell used.  People see it as the barebones Corvette and rightfully so.  I think a LT Z would be the best for resale value along with red paint and an automatic transmission.  Red accounted for something like  of sales last year and was the most popular color so I imagine it would be easier to resell.  I wouldnt get any appearance options not even differentcolored wheels and I would probably not opt for magnetic selective ride control or the performance data recorder.  I feel like both of those options are ones youd pay for now but would not be as appealing when it comes time to sale.  I did however get those options for my own car but thats because I intend to keep it for myself.Honestly though and depending on your financial outlook you may want to throw all of that out the window and just get the right car for you.  I know I would not have ordered my car any other way though Im not planning to sell it.  So youll need to figure out if the compromises e.g. an automatic are worth the extra money you may save when you sell it vs. the value you derive from enjoying your car for the next two years.,Corvette,cpom674,2,t5_2qxld

I think in  GM changed the Z mufflers to match those of the NPP on the base and grand sport and the ZR.  From  the Zs muffler w the valves open went straight through a perforated section of pipe that was surrounded by a chamber full of fiberglass packing.  In  they did away with the perforated section and just made it a solid pipe like the NPP and ZR mufflers so it really is a straight through exhaust with the butterfly valves open. So its noticeably louder imo...But yes the C zs are amazing cars and I highly recommend one!,Corvette,czi6pjd,1,t5_2qxld

7453851,0,t1_d2pfxpp,Firstly let me caveat by saying I have not driven a C. I own an  manual transmission C. I cant say how the traction control system has evolved since then.If I am pushing things a bit well kind of a lot and Im in even a mild curve I will usually get a mild fishtail when I shift. Not to say I start fishtailing out of control but the rear wheels will break free for just a moment and drift slightly towards the outside of the curve. I know how much of one to expect at what speed and for how much of a curve etc. Thats on a completely dry road optimal conditions in the normal driving mode.My subjective judgement would be that the TCS seems to be set up for keeping you safer in fairly ideal traction conditions. It will help you get a good launch rather than just smoking tires from a standing start. It will also kick in and annoy me when Im cornering hard on purpose and when Im in the mood to play a little I usually end up kicking mine over into competitive driving mode so it will get off my back a little.That said I think its easy to get yourself in trouble in rainy conditions. Again only have experience with mine and what Ive seen others do. With the tires that came on mine I couldnt go faster than about  MPH complete straight line in heavy rains without feeling the vehicle starting to hydroplane and the steering getting loose. I usually stuck to the right lane threw on my hazards and just cruised along at what let me get good traction.Turns seem to be the biggest problem in rain. I think its pretty easy to spin or at least start to making a turn in the rain. If youre starting from a stop and easing onto the throttle a bit too fast youll probably feel her start to go and be able to back off quickly enough to save yourself easily. If you were approaching a turn at speed and trying to make it quickly you may be spinning through the intersection by the time you fully appreciate the fact that you didnt have enough traction available. TCS isnt magic it mostly has control over the throttle not the steering input and both can consume your available traction budget.Mostly I think if you drive it in a sane fashion youll be fine. I know I push mine a lot harder than a lot of people push theirs but I am very aware of the limits. Just be extra careful in rain the first few times.In terms of tickets... Im probably gonna jinx myself just saying this but Ive never had a ticket in mine. I also pay a lot of attention to my surroundings and I dont hotdog when Im near a cop I can see or in areas I know to be historically high on enforcement. Depending on the area you live in I think a lot of cops are likely to be more interested in the car than in giving you a ticket so if youre not an ass even if you get stopped if youre friendly youre probably reasonably likely to still get off with a warning but it depends a lot on the cop and the area.Some of the things I have done in mine should definitely have gotten me tickets though. Best advice I can give you there is to pay attention. The stretch with the underpass that the cop can hide behind that you cant see until youre past him isnt the time to drop it to third on the highway and punch past someone at .,Corvette,d2pgep6,2,t5_2qxld

7528528,0,t1_d2xy9r0,I do my burnouts in sport mode with TC off so the tires will spin freely.  I then usually switch to Track Mode and turn TC back on.  My best run was using that setting.  One of the runs at the  mark I forgot to switch and ran it in Sport Mode with TC off.  I had a fair amount of wheel spin through first gear finally hooking up late.  I didnt pedal because I was expecting TC to manage it.  Without drag radials Im not sure I can get good traction through first unless I pedal.  Honestly the TC seems to help a LOT through first gear.  MY next step is to learn the routine for Launch Control as Ive heard it does a really good job of managing that first gear then lets you free when you shift to nd.I havent had good luck getting Launch Control to activate...need to spend a little more time working that out.  Wheel needs to be straight and car in first gear stopped.  Ive been hitting TC button twice and switching to Race Mode however I may just need to hit TC once.  Ill play around with it a little more so I can test it next time.  Going to switch back to my Automatic car though next few times to get my team some points.,Corvette,d2xyggc,2,t5_2qxld

When it does just replace with an ATI balancer and never worry about it again.Rocker panels are easily broken from bumps and steep driveways.  But also broken from improper lifting.
