288369,0,t3_1xe4jm,Hey if theyre coming out too flat try rolling up the first bit until the rice completely surrounds the filling.  Then make a C shape with your hands around the bamboo roller and try lightly crushing it by closing that C shape. After a few times you should get the hand of how much pressure the sushi needs to hold its shape without smooshing the rice.  This is how I was able to get the hang of assembling sushi though I dont pretend to be any expert of any kind though I make quite a sushi on a regular basis so its worked so far.The other thing I would mention is that someone else in this thread noticed the rice looked awfully mushy which could mean that too much watervinegar was added to the rice.  I recommend getting something like an Aroma Rice Cooker and using a  ie cup of water to cup of rice ratio of moisture to rice and letting the cooker do its thing.  That should get the consistency youre looking for. You can also get Calrose or Botan sushi grade which you can get pretty much anywhere. I get mine in a lb bag at Kroger but theyre cheaper at any asian market.Hope this helps happy rolling! ,sushi,cfanjno,3,t5_2qm24

1699836,0,t1_cjtf9bs, C is  F which is what our freezer is. This is the normal freezer temperature. Just get the fresh fish. Rinse in water to remove fishy smell. Pat dry with paper towel. Saran wrap it tight a few times. Throw in the freezer. Youre all set.. The main problem with eating fish raw is the parasites and salmon has such low parasite rate you dont have to worry about it so much. DO NOT eat fresh water fish raw. This means tilapia. And no need for massaging the fish. Just remove the mushy parts along the middle and use it for rolls. The main difficulty is the sushi rice prep. Right balance of sugar salt and vinegar. Rice has to be sweet and sour. Salty not so much because I dunk my sushi in soy sauce. As long as you get that right. youll have an awesome sushi. Anytime you want. Forming the nigiri takes a bit of practice too. If you fail at first just squeeze the whole thing in your palm and eat it and you will find it tastes the same. But try to get it right. ,sushi,cjtfdvj,0,t5_2qm24

If you got prepared eel with BBQ sauce I throw mine in a hot water bath water very warm to the touch but not scalding for a few minutes. Once its soft I take it out of the bag and slice it. Then I reheat in a toaster oven. Cooked eel will always be safe to eat if property reheated and not left out at room temperature.,sushi,cn2oiwa,2,t5_2qm24

I dont support fishing species that are being fished to death.

6297713,0,t3_41s1of,It was the first time I had ever considered that eating something could be an experience. I first had sushi when I was  from a dinky mall cafeteria stand. Up until then I had never really had anything experimental in the food department just standard North American food with the occasional Chinese or Taco night. The first bite I had was half of a California roll and it moved me in a way I didnt know existed. The texture and taste and composition of sushi was something I had never seen before and I remember that I could hardly comprehend how it worked. I was staring at the remaining half of the California roll so intently that I didnt notice both my sister and dad tell me if you dont like it you can spit it out while offering a napkin. I remember how I noticed each part of it separately and I kept moving it around my mouth with my tongue to change it and take more notice of it. I didnt know the flavour of sesame before. I had never eaten sweet and salty and sticky rice before. I learned that seaweed was edible. I didnt know you could mix crab and avocado and cucumber together. I didnt understand that despite the roll being one piece of food there could be so much going on at the same time. After that first bite I kept trying different types of sushi from all over the place and it eventually became me trying every type of cuisine. I rarely find a dish that I will not try and when I do its usually because of hygienic standards. Sushi inspired me to go into a the culinary line of work and recreate my first experience with food for others. ,sushi,cz5h8vz,4,t5_2qm24

If i had to name some rolls as starter i would say Rolls like shrimp tempura  Godzilla  Spicy tuna.

Uni ranges in color from rich gold to light yellow and has a creamy consistency that some love and is offputting to others.It straight up tastes like a shot of ocean water with the consistency of pudding. Its awesome. I usually dont like to eat it with the seaweed nori that they wrap it in because I enjoy the flavor of the Uni so much while the nori can be great at some restaurants and shit at others.

10295532,0,t1_dcag61h,Its personal preference really. Sashimi is usually cut thicker and you dip it lightly in soy sauce or they may provide a sauce for you to dip it in. Nigiri is meant to be more of a complete bite that is assembled by the chef when done right. With nigiri the chef will add whatever ingredients he wants to go with the bite like rubbing wasabi on the bottom garlicginger puree onions different types of fish eggs brushed on sauce daikon etc. Thats only if you are going to a slightly more expensive place sitting at the sushi bar also helps. If you go to an AYCE place then they generally dont put much effort into the nigiri and youre just gonna get some fish on top of the rice because they expect that most people are just gonna douse it in soy sauce anyway.,sushi,dcb1z0k,1,t5_2qm24
