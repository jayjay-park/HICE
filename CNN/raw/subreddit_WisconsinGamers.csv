11047726,0,t3_5xo1nd,Its been awhile but Ive been there several times. Here are my thoughtsLots of really nice computers with most games gamers play. They also have about  Xbox ones a couple of Wiis. They do have VR.It gets busy fridays and saturdays nights but usually wasnt full when we went. Again I havent been there in months but things mightve changedThey serve food right to you! Which was great! Burgerschicken bitesmy favoritechicken sandwich and more. Decent fooddecent prices.All you can drink fountain soda. Coke products for  foam oz cup. Prices for playing there were a little pricy imo. But this was the only gaming lounge Ive been too. If recall it was  for  hours. But more expensive if you bought less hours. Also your time per your account was saved if you didnt use it all. If you wanted a pass for the whole day it was .The service from employees was pretty good! Friendly and always helpful. Sometimes computers would glitch or have problems etc.They do competitions for many different games which they have schedules for posted there.All in all its definitely worth trying out and seeing if you enjoy it. Plus you can meet a ton of new people.,WisconsinGamers,dek8oar,1,t5_3j5fk
