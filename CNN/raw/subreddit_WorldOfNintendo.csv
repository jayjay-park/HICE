As I was there on Walmarts mobile website in addition to the Falco  figure being stock I saw that the Falco plush was available to order as well.The next thought I had was maybe Walmart had the White Tanooki Blooper amp Tingle plush in stock from the last wave.

Its strange because I was at Walmart the other day and they had aisles of Fire Luigis so I know someone didnt come by to buy them all up.
