1459277,0,t1_ciz70ac,date Sat Sep    from Phil Jones ltp.jonesuea.xx.xxgt subject Re kilimanjaro to Jenkins Geoff ltgeoff.jenkinsmetoffice.xx.xxgtGeoff The data that are used for the grid box should be within the grid box. They will be low elevation sites though and this may be part of the reason. It might be worth seeing if there is anything in the UA data  but I reckon there wont be much in that region.Ive heard Lonnie Thompson talk about the Kilimanjaro core and he got some local temperatures  that we dont have access to and there was little warming in them. The same situation applies for Quelccaya in Peru and also some of his Tibet sites. Lonnie thinks they are disappearing because of sublimation but he cant pin anything down. They are going though.Lonnies email is Lonnie G. Thompson ltthompson.osu.xxx.xxxgt You could try emailing Ellen as well both might be in the field. Ellen MosleyThompson ltthompson.osu.xxx.xxxgt Im off much of the next  weeks at meetings. I hear youre retiring soon  hope all goes well !  Im sure youll still be in the field somewhere. Cheers Phil At   you wrotephil ltltkilimanjaro.docgtgt we have been concerned that people often use the melting glacier on kilimanjaro as an example of impacts of manmade warming. you may have seen some stories countering this on the sceptics websites.I got philip brohan to look at temps there see attached and there isnt any convincing consistent recent warming in the station data. but your gridded CRUtemV does show a recent warming. presumably that is because as philip suggests the gridded stuff has influences from quite a large radius and hence may reflect warming at stations a long way from kilimanjaro?would you agree that there is no convincing evidence for kilimanjaro glacier melt being due to recent warming let alone manmade warming? be grateful for your help cheers geoff Dr Geoff Jenkins Head Climate Prediction Programme Hadley Centre Met Office FitzRoy Road EXETER EX PB UK tel    xxxxxx mobile    www.hadleycentre.xxxx.xxProf. Phil Jones Climatic Research Unit        Telephone     School of Environmental Sciences    Fax     University of East Anglia Norwich                          Email    p.jonesuea.ac.uk NR TJ UK,GlobalWarming,ciz71u5,1,t5_2qi7x
1554223,0,t1_cjaisan,Goddards analysis was rubbish except perhaps for his criticism that NOAA may have used estimated values when they didnt need to but the adjustment would be minor.  Keep in mind that several other independent data sets track closely with NOAA such as RSS and UAH satellite data JRA HADCRUT and the Berkeley Earth Temperature Project.,GlobalWarming,cjb3g0x,1,t5_2qi7x

It would have cost less than k today. Ive save about  each year from gas so thats good.,GlobalWarming,cy12nae,1,t5_2qi7x
9327245,0,t1_d8ihjlk,Hi so Ive been thinking if really our problem is just an increase in co in our atmosphere. Couldnt we find ways to leak it out of the atmosphere? Obviously our tech wouldnt even know how to attempt that at the moment but I feel like that sounds way easier to accomplish tech wise than say maybe break down all of the co in the air.,GlobalWarming,d8yap1b,1,t5_2qi7x

However the actual real world demonstrates a very strong effectThis of course is obvious when you understand how transpiration works and how trees work. What isnt obvious is why anyone would think this would not happen...everything about tree biology predicts that C is a huge fertilizer. ,GlobalWarming,d9py1ze,1,t5_2qi7x

11776114,0,t1_dguecki,First of all your image is based on a false premise i.e. that the hypothesis for global warming was based after observations that temperatures had increased. In fact global warming was predicted decades before any warming was detected based on the physical properties of CO.Second the graph makes a number of false statements such as the claim that temperature dropped after . Also adressing CO does not mean undoing  years of industrial progress.So that graph is total crap. There are plenty of lines of evidence supporting AGW theory which is why nearly all major scientific institutions accept it as the standard model.,GlobalWarming,dguuxgs,4,t5_2qi7x
