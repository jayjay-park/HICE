10208615,0,t1_dc06mhw,I dont think Fu style has anything to do with Liu YunQiao? Taiwan baji has a very distinct flavour and Fu style is... not so similar,bajiquan,dc17bwp,1,t5_2sbyj
10565604,0,t3_5qmx1g,Excuse slow replies.  Havent been on much.  I believe that there is some Baji in Spain which may be fairly cheap to travel to. Or Italy.  I would suggest maybe learning something else Chinese until you can come. Sure it wont teach you baji fali but itll work as basic conditioning and prep.  You could likely find a simple Shaolin school and focus on stance and jibengong. Even if you only learn the  basic stances and some simple punching etc you can train that hard and itll make it easier once you can learn.  Sadly there is no online distance learning for Baji right now.. at least none that I would recommend...    uMiikaW can you chime in?  You dont do any distance learning or e coaching at the moment do you?,bajiquan,dd5qbf1,1,t5_2sbyj
