1145275,0,t1_chyg6a4,gtIf your quality of life is high enough with low enough effort and you still care about inequality its envy thats the problem.Both quality of life and effort required are a measure of value. All value is subjective. You do not get into the realm of absolute objective jealousy or not through defining all your terms subjectively. More fundamentally there is no such thing as value without the very same mechanisms that create jealousy. The two are inseparable.gtIf the lower end has high enough upward mobility they dont care about it.Judging by the amount of civil unrest since  Id argue the empirical facts are not in your favor both in terms of the consequences and in terms of the actual facts on mobilitygtThe general level of wealth is more than high enough to not need subsistence farming.Is that why people starve?gtThe problem in western countries is the lack of freedom to use that wealth.I will never in my life have the opportunity to start a competing energy industry. The players who accrue enough regional wealth to provide the infrastructure even in a free market will be the longstanding firstcomers to the industry and remain undominated until fundamental technology shifts render their model irrelevant. It is not simply the case with energy costs either the facts on natural monopoly and barriers to entry make simplistic platitudes about freely creating competition in a free market an increasingly stupid pile of bullshit.gtgtWhere do you think government came from in the first place?gtFear of the unknown. Its a left over from religion.Is that why all new regimes created all over the word over all of recorded history are manifested as ways for the wealthy to secure their wealth?

1433470,1,t1_civu6t7,The broken window fallacy relies on a flawed concept of perfect information that does not exist for shoestore owners or anyone else in an economy in fact.Edit since people decided to circumvent the CSS just to downvote me for the Broken Window Fallacy to be a fallacy it requires that the shoemaker have the opportunity cost and expected future value of every piece of capital in his shop. That is to say if the breaking of his window and his expenditure on the glazier forces him to buy an efficient window seal that actually ends up saving him money it is only a fallacy if we assume he somehow knew about this moneysaving glass and any other money saving upgrades. Otherwise he is in fact better off himself as well as the glazier as well as any one else who he buys from in the long term.In other words the typical observation is not that it is grand for stuff to be blown up or destroyed but that for small amounts of destruction of wealth the longterm wealth might increase because of capital improvement. And it is not a safe assumption that the actor knew about all of these capital improvements prior to the destruction of the item.,LibertarianDebates,civynft,-1,t5_2tvku

2202872,0,t1_cljqoio,gt The perception of brands is factored by advertising more so than necessarily the quality of branded products themselves. People are not basing their spending decisions on personal rational decision making because this is actually the intention of the marketing industry to encourage people to spend irrationally.Citations fucking needed. gt Under the conditions that advertising did not exist people would spend their cash differently. I personally think it would have a positive effect on consumer spending behavior because purchasing decisions would have to be made not based on accounts given from producers themselves but upon more neutral third party sources.Citations needed. Also rd party sources do exist. gt All advertising primarily appeals to emotion. This is pretty basic knowledge to anyone in the industry. Advertising isnt necessary to communicate price or quality it only becomes necessary as a defensive measure against competition under the conditions advertising is the name of the game.Im still trying to decide if your last sentence here actually means anything when parsed in English. As for the rest citation needed. gt All the examples you gave of knowledge being transferred via advertisements could just as easily be communicated more neutrally objectively and efficiently without marketing.Citation needed notice a trend here yet?. gt Good point. People are irrational and fall victim to a lot of extramarket forces. I dont see why that justifies intentionally increasing the level of emotive thinking induced by allowing an industry to intentionally manipulate the purchasing judgments of consumers.First citation needed on the claim that advertising actually does what you claim here. Second youre missing the point. You want to institute a bunch of regulations costing resources and impeding on individuals rights especially speech which I shouldnt have to prove to be important. Therefore it is up to you to justify the proposition. Your reasoning would justify government regulation on pretty much any aspect of life total control over both the social and economic spheres of life control over culture over parenting over who can have children over education over all media and science etc. ,LibertarianDebates,clju7kj,2,t5_2tvku

3452491,0,t1_cpllhfv,gtThat seems rather long. Can you tell me where in the article it says that natural monopolies cant exist?It is like proving that God does not exist. The concept of a Natural Monopoly is an economic theory. Seems reasonable but that only makes the matter worth investigating not automatically true. DiLorenzo deconstructs the theory and the flawed logic behind it.Quality refutations are always going to be a lot longer than stuff that just sounds reasonable.gthighly suspect commoditiesIn your example there are a lot of unrealistic presumptions though not explicitly stated. For example how was this technology discovered how do you go from impossible to requiring a trillion dollars to get started? Further in reality a trillion dollars worth of what? Why? I dont expect you to be able to answer because this is just a hypothetical but in reality that is an entrepreneurial problem and in reality you have given an answer without a question. Like .In short that isnt how you prove unproven technology thus in the interim the entire endeavor is highly suspect. It is no coincidence that stuff that everybody depends upon is widely available and almost impossible for a small group of people to control.As far as amazing resources if I wasnt making sense there gold and silver are not only pretty but the most useful metals in the world. We would do so much if we had more but just because it is more useful than anything else doesnt mean anybody is going to spend a trillion dollars expanding mining operations tomorrow.As far as scales of production large capital investments can make it marginally cheaper to produce one thing a very particular way. The problem is that when resources are tied up in one thing they cant be used for something else. This makes the cost of change for large firms very expensive where it is very inexpensive for smaller firms. Sometimes people are really smart and can in a respect see the future of technology. Many will risk and a few will win. But you cant be right about everything all the time. IBM was once a titan of industry that nobody could compete with. Sun Microsystems HP Microsoft are Apple and Google somehow different than the titans of the past?

7789750,0,t3_4lzeu8,gt A poor person can not do what they want to do like a rich person can. Therefore we should attempt to lift as many people out of poverty as possible in order to increase their freedom and society as a whole.Free is not the same as equal. Nature is unequal. Some people are smarter stronger more attractive etc. If you want to remove wealth then why not also remove intelligence strength beauty? Should we cut off Usain Bolts leg so that I am free to compete in the Olympic m sprint?gt How is it fair just or morally justifiable that somebody should have an easier life than somebody else because they were born into wealth something they didnt work for and had no control over?First I reject the notion that life is or should be fair. Everybody should play by the same rules but we cannot make everyone start in the same place.Second you focus on the person inheriting wealth but there is another side to the equation. At some point a person earned the wealth. If a person earns wealth freedom means they can use it for whatever they want and that includes giving it to their family. Yes the recipients are lucky no they probably dont deserve the wealth but to say a person cannot give their money to whomever they wish is a massive violation of freedom.,LibertarianDebates,d3rmhq4,6,t5_2tvku

7954146,0,t3_4nutqd,A common libertarian view is that gun rights allow citizens to defend themselves and stand up to an unlawful government agent. So if a police officer is unlawfully endangering you you have the ability to defend yourself. Therefore wherever the line is drawn it should be drawn at the same point for all domestic citizens government agents and civilians.No government agent ever uses or threatens the use of WMD against civilians. Therefore nobody needs WMDs for defense. With the increased militarization of police civilians often have automatic weapons pointed at them without having ever broken a law. We saw a lot of this in Ferguson. Police units with tanks snipers and machine guns trying to keep the peace. Due to this fact I believe it would be tyrannical to not allow citizens the right to own a tank sniper rifles and machine guns.On the other hand if we demilitarized police so that they only had semiautomatic weapons and no tanks I think it would be reasonable to expect the same from civilians. Until that happens though disarming the populace just leaves them open to unlawful searches seizures intimidation violence and even death as weve seen with the numerous police murders that have been protested recently. If you want police to be prevented from killing innocent people you need the means to prevent it from happening.,LibertarianDebates,d4a4cqx,3,t5_2tvku
