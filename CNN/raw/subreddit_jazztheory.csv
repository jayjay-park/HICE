1193166,0,t3_27s7b0,gt Does it make sense to talk about the theory of a movement borne from folk tradition improvisation and freedom?Absolutely it does. All music has rules not necessarily unbreakable its just that folk music and some other styles arent as academically formalized as classical music is and as jazz is becoming. If there werent any rules or structure to jazz then any schmuck with a saxophone could get up and sound like Byrd. But they cant and the theory of jazz lies in the reasons why they cant.gt Does the theory even exist or are we just inventing rules to explain the patterns we hear?Thats what all music theory is.,jazztheory,ci3ulvk,3,t5_323yq
1207642,0,t1_ci5gcbg,thats really helpful thank you! So for example when moving to another chord is it important to start on the root note of the chord as the bass part? Or should I mix it up and start on another note in the chord? Or any note in the current scale? Or just any chromatic note?Also a bossa doesnt follow a walking bass line usually so I think approaching the root note chromatically shouldnt be used excessively.,jazztheory,ci5h829,1,t5_323yq

4689223,0,t1_ctllllz,Wow thanks for the full breakdown. Ive been trying to teach myself jazz piano for about a year now. Sometimes it is slow going since so much can be happening at once. That is a lot going on in just one chord voicing! And the great part is if I were to ask someone else they might have a totally different interpretation of what is happening. But I think thats whats so fun about playing jazz.,jazztheory,ctlmbw8,2,t5_323yq

5836297,0,t1_cxjyjlo,I can only practice in my dorms practice room. My phone has very bad quality audio that would be drowned out by the sound of my playing and my laptop doesnt have a battery and so needs to be plugged in. There are no outlets in the room unfortunately. So yeah...,jazztheory,cxknyzg,1,t5_323yq

7702929,0,t1_d3hrfno,I agree with all of this but if he really wanted to do some backgrounds behind solos that seems fine.  It is a specific arrangement and while I see solo backgrounds on big band charts I have seen a few on small group stuff.  ,jazztheory,d3hrsj5,2,t5_323yq
8003863,0,t3_4ost7r,The answers here van be wrong. Shuffle is a type of groove based on swing eighths where the drums play a strong back beat on snare on  and . Swing drums in general play the back beat only using the hi hat. Another difference is that in swing the drums play continuous th notes dada Dada dada Dada . In jazz they play one quarter note and  eighth notes  da Dada da Dadafor every half bar on ride or hi hat. The bass in swing walks mostly quarter tones.  In shuffle sometimes they play all of the eighth notes. They indeed both have swong eighth notes. Only one has strong back beat and one has a less strong back beat. On piano you would play more on shuffle and more sparse on swing. ,jazztheory,d4fpkfq,1,t5_323yq

9535748,0,t1_d9obtso,This is super helpful and gives me a lot to think about. Just one questiongtAltered chords do not ALWAYS have both the  and  altered. They can have just one or they can have multiple. Like if you see Gb thats an altered chord. G? Gb? altered chord. When soloing you can use any of the alterations over it.Are you saying that you can play a b and a  over a chord voicing with a natural  like G?,jazztheory,d9ohadw,1,t5_323yq
10034480,0,t3_5ew813,Well with the ii chord you could easily play the Dorian mode over it and it would sound fine. I know when I solo over Blues like that I do the blues scale of each individual chord when soloing and then if I get a ii I mess with the Dorian mode a little bit. ,jazztheory,dbfipc5,1,t5_323yq
10058996,0,t1_dbiatu0,Right on Ill give those a try. Thanks!,jazztheory,dbipmhv,2,t5_323yq
11412317,0,t1_dfpctmw,Those were chord tones not chords and the bass notes were melodic notes not necessarily in that order. As far as it being a Calt and which voicing I use B EF and A or the b the  the  and the b. Thanks,jazztheory,dfpkp8d,2,t5_323yq
