I am  and my girlfriend of  years is getting increasingly uncomfortable with my photography purchases so I definitely foresee this being something I may face in the future. I just want to know how it comes to that and if it is something avoidable.I live with my girlfriend and were very close and make lots of big purchases together. But seeing as I make money with my photographyvideography and am growing professionally I feel I have the right to spend my own money. As long as of course I pay my bills and am responsible.

2097576,0,t3_2ixmyw,I dont want to be THAT guy but I think you should skip the modes and go full manual from the start. You really only have the three controls ISO aperture and shutterspeed to worry about and theyre very easy to master.You say you want shots of unsuspecting people with shallow DOF. So that means youre going to likely have your aperture as low as it can go maybe a couple clicks up and then adjust ISO and shutterspeed accordingly.For dark situations ISO is going to be your friend. Youll have to experiment and see what noise levels youre happy with and then adjust shutterspeed and aperture around that. Both of those will likely be low.Action shots mean high shutterspeed and likely a medium ISO to accommodate that unless you are in a very well lit situation. Aperture is what you want it to be.Some more things to consider Try to keep shutterspeed at least the length of your lens. So if you have a mm lens aim to have a shutterspeed of . This helps to not get blurry shots and is a very general rule. Dont be afraid of higher ISO. It isnt  anymore and noise levels in cameras have gotten so much better. Aperture is what controls you DOF. So a small fstop . . . etc. is going to have a shallow DOF while the opposite is true for higher fstops. Also the length of you lens will affect DOF. The longer your lens the less DOF youll get at certain apertures compared to shorter and usually wider lenses. For example a mm at f. and a mm at f. are going to have two very different DOFs with the mm having more in focus.If I had to do it all over again I would read as much as I could on framing and composition and the theory behind it. The camera operations are the easy part. Getting photos that are appealing is the hardest part of all. Good luck hope this helped a little.,canon,cl6g5a8,7,t5_2qi07

3151497,0,t3_2vzic3,I have a D and do documentary style shooting with it.I do have Cinestyle installed but tend to prefer the Neutral profile w flat settings instead  Sharpness  Contrast  Saturation  Color Tone.Cinestyle gets WAY more dynamic range and a much more flat image. But unless youre fairly skilled at color correction and have a lot of time in post to spend on each clip its quite a bit cumbersome to work with the clips after shooting.With a Neutral flat profile and good white balancing during shooting I find that just a quick  second tweak of the Way Color Corrector in Premiere gets things looking very nice very quick. With Cinestyle sometimes it takes maybe  minutes and a few layers of effects to get into the same ball park.If I was shooting a major project that I know I wanted to spare nothing to obtain the absolute BEST the camera could and was prepared to spend much more time in post Id shoot Cinestyle.As for Magic Lantern its a Godsend for video on the D. However I would not recommend shooting RAW for documentary work. Its too unstable and WAY too cumbersome for massive amount of footage on a decently quick turnaround.

8387439,0,t3_4ug2yh,A few things to try  checkHeres a process  . Power off if possible  . Remove battery  . Remove memory card  . Put battery back in  . Put memory card back in looking for the red flickering to see it register the card  . Try to power onRepeat that process up to about  times it may recover take note of the red light and if it flickers.If the red light doesnt flicker at all and you get zero response try swapping the memory card for another eg if you have an adapter a microSD from your phone or GoPro and repeating the above process. If it boots back up your memory card may be dead. Be wary though as this might not be the end of your troubles.When you open your battery flap theres a little opening here with a little plastic pin sticking up within it. That pin detects if the battery flap is closed or not give it a little nudge just to make sure its not stuck or something even try nudging it gently as far forward or as far rearward as itll go prior to closing the flap. If that works then great.Lens take off your lens and carefully clean the metal contacts it can cause issues if the camera cant read lens data properly.Last ditch  optional I saw a video where a guy blew compressed air being careful not to form any condensation by keeping the can of compressed air upright and preblowing away from the camera into the memory card slot and it somehow fixed it. Im not a fan of the idea however as rapid cooling can cause mechanical stress on components and can potentially cause water to condense inside your camera body.If you cant find an issue try to remember if your camera was getting hotter than usual around the time it had its issues. My EOS D has run into issues as well and besides getting warmer than usual I once had my camera freeze I turned it off put it in my bag went home pulled it out an hour later and even though it was off it was quite warm drawing power while turned off. Mine was also giving Error  codes.If thats the case for you I have bad news for you its likely a main electronics board issue and its going to be expensive to fix. Canon sent me a quote and the main board replacement cost alone is half the price of a new D  lens. Labor is another . Going through a discount store its actually going to be cheaper for me to buy a new D body than to have mine repaired.,canon,d5pz7c4,2,t5_2qi07

8782365,0,t3_50ct6s,Ive got the  f. II and the Sigma  f..  I carry the zoom with a  f. every day I shoot for work as they pair well together as youd expect.  I find the overlap between them very useful as it keeps me from swapping out too often in the field.  They also both have the same diameter cap Ive moved ND filters between them when needed.I consider the  f. more of a specialty lens and Ill bring it out when I have a specific kind of shot in mind.  Some of my favorite evening shots in the last year were with it  its crazy sharp and exhibits more contrast compared to the Canon.  I find it has less coma too.  Note the front element prevents filters even a UV just for protection its heavier than the  and not weather sealed.  So if you love your  as most do and you feel youd like to extend that same feel color and contrast but wider for street interiors landscape  Id go with the canon.
