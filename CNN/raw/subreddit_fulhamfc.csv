23899,0,t1_ceh5gnm,Im not going to lie. I had actually completely forgot about him. I remember us signing him last year and getting over excited about Jol building a great set of youth prospects.... I guess he just needed a bit of time either that or Rene just decided to give him a chance in the cup. The assist wont do his confidence any damage though so good on him. ,fulhamfc,ceh5jwo,1,t5_2t2kg

300764,0,t1_cfbx6b4,Good luck getting  points. That will literally never happen. The game is just going to be rearranged hopefully before your Spurs game so youre worn out.Also Im a United fan I just came on this subreddit peacefully to see how Fulham fans were reacting to the game at the weekend.

935844,0,t1_chag7u3,Besides this year Sidwell frustrated the shit out of me. If he leaves Im okay with that. Dejagah is good enough to get poached. I hope the rest of that list stays. All could feasibly leave though.Id love to see the youth given focus. Id love to see us bounce down a year grow stronger and bounce back up with one of the youngest sides in the league with a solid foundation.,fulhamfc,chansjd,2,t5_2t2kg

2582748,0,t3_2pd0ll,I never really saw the upside in him. Maybe it was because he was playing without any help at the PL level but I was rarely impressed by his overall decision making. Maybe some time in the Championship will make me feel differently,fulhamfc,cmvpaur,4,t5_2t2kg

3094686,0,t3_2vjs52,As ecstatic as I am that well have him for the rest of the season I cant help but feel desperately sorry for the guy. Hes been aching to leave for over a year now and every time something seems to fall through. He seems to have reached an understanding with Kit though so Id imagine hell play for the rest of the season but we wont push for him to sign a contract.,fulhamfc,coirh1d,5,t5_2t2kg
3334086,0,t1_cp7t9qy,I think we HAVE to stick with Symons unless he loses the next  games. They are so crucial. If we lose the next  then fire and just put Curbs in until the end of the year. Evaluate how he does from that.,fulhamfc,cp8b8h9,2,t5_2t2kg

4988024,0,t3_3j8rsr,Two things. Hoped to sign Hooper with smith being injured and Taggart going out on loan. Hopefully this could still happen.. Think this has been an extremely positive transfer window. Really happy with the work done from the FO. Mike Rigg seems like a very talented leader in our club. Now Kit needs to mold these boys into a team or be removed. ,fulhamfc,cun8prg,4,t5_2t2kg
