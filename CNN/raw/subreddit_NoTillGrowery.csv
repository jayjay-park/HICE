6138153,0,t1_cynbhyu,I use this in my no till container and it is crawling with beneficial bugs. It really only affects the bad ones. Cinnamon is basically the number one because it kills on contact and destroys most eggs. The real beneficial organisms in your container are unaffected. ,NoTillGrowery,cyncdly,1,t5_38z3a
6849812,0,t1_d0s8uo3,Careful when using this recipe this is a method for natural farming in the garden not specifically CANNABIS farming. Its an important distinction. Cannabis requires special care.Theres also a reason these really opinionated guys have no pictures posted of their plants.Edibles uses the stronger recipe and its completely stunted his flowering plants. Check it out if you dont believe me www.instagram.comborealisdank  Hes on week  flowering.EDIT Another food for thought If you read the beginning of the book on KNF it puts a lot of effort into making a very succinct point TO you and thats that you should be experimenting with the plants roots fruits and herbs that are native to where you are and what your specific plant BEST responds to. That is the basis of the scientific method. You cannot BOX your thought process up If you never do anything new you will never achieve anything new.Much love.,NoTillGrowery,d0sqf1l,1,t5_38z3a

7317264,0,t1_d29w9nx,That source directly contradicts your hypothesis that while using it wont make your plants more potent because it does make the plants produce more cannabinoids.gtMy current hypothesis is that the distribution of terpene  cannabinoid content would be more even when testing different bud sites on the plant as well as having increased trichome coverage.So more cannabinoids are produced their bioavailability is not changed.,NoTillGrowery,d29x8x1,2,t5_38z3a
8017687,0,t1_d4gjfct,It sounds like your soil microbial life is almost non existent especially if youre just using water. It takes about  weeks to build up your microbes with weekly watering of compost tea. You want the full array of nematodes protozoa fungi etc that a tea can provide. You need the microbial life to break down the amendments into plant soluble form. Your plant cant eat a lot of that yummy stuff in the soil without them.Adding some worms in too wouldnt be a bad idea as theyll also help your soil food web. In the meantime it wouldnt hurt to throw some organic fish emulsion or hydrolysate kelp aloe Vera coconut water silica Ful Power malted barley and sprouted seed teas to help them along while youre waiting for your microbial life to grow.,NoTillGrowery,d4h9ghx,3,t5_38z3a
8203020,0,t1_d52weuv,If they arent drying out then you are probably over watering. A soil that is constantly wet means youre starving the roots and microorganisms of oxygen  creating an anaerobic lack of oxygenbad organisms thrive environment. Its not necessarily an ingredient youre mixing in thats going bad. Water itself can create an anaerobic environment. Think about a pond stagnant versus a rushing river oxygenated. Which would you feel safer drinking from?Or a hot tub...if its stagnant unfiltered and not treated with chemicals left on its own it can grow all sorts of nastiness.Let your soil dry out a bit and breathe. You can do foliar applications in lieu of drenches if you want to give your ladies a boost of something.,NoTillGrowery,d52xjek,2,t5_38z3a

8627343,0,t1_d6jpfbl,Thaaanks mate. On another note can you please point out where Im wrong? I like being corrected but not being told nah youre wrong heres some down votes and a generic description of mycelium...      He means in mycorrhizae the plant gets the benefits of  myceliums higher absorptive capacity of water and mineral nutrients because of the finer and large surface area of hyphae. What he cant believe is that this symbiosis can sometimes be pathogenic and that mycorrhizal fungi can sometimes under some conditions take nutrients from plants.,NoTillGrowery,d6k0sew,2,t5_38z3a

10047419,0,t1_dbh71oq,They add azomite mixed minerals granite dust calcium and magnesium diatomaceous earth coco coir molasses and innoculant. All of this is added to organic material that is then broken down by the worms. the finished castings are screened to  and sprayed with a solution of filtered water molasses and beneficial microbes cultured at our facility and then slightly dried. some moisture is preserved to support microbial life in transit. you may find some small worms and egg cocoons in your bag,NoTillGrowery,dbh7de2,1,t5_38z3a
