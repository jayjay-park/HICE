227568,0,t3_1wpmy7,Here is the biggest difference USC IS THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA. NOT UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAProud of abstractly and historically  the state flag is really beautiful and its everywhere. It commentates when charleston held off British attack during the revolutionary war  fort moultrie on Sullivans island in charleston was attacked as the British tried to land but the palmetto trees held against cannonballs. Also One side of the state seal has a palmetto tree rising above a shattered oak tree representing the defeat of the British navy in the same battle. This is why the palmetto tree symbol is EVERYWHERE in SC though they only grow within say  miles of the coast. again the symbol of the palm tree and the crescent moon is everywhere  tons of people have vanity plates with the symbol on it and many have decals on their windows with it too. The flag is colored indigo because that became a cash crop. Coincidentally a woman Eliza Lucas Pinckney developed it EXTREMELY rare in the preRevolutionary planters class. SC is historically and generally a very independent state as are its people. SC has attempted to secede four times first from the province of Carolina next from the British empire and then twice from the union SC wanted to revolt during the Mexico crisis of the s but even the other southern states thought that was crazy. The first shots of the civil war were fired by cadets of the citadel at fort Sumter in charleston harbor. as already mentioned people are proud of their southern hospitality  to the point that some in the contemporary black civil rights community argued that the reason the transition from racist Jim Crow policy to desegregation WITHOUT VIOLENCE happened in SC because the whites had manners and upholding an orderly and calm society was more important than repressing africanAmericans. Its THAT key a cultural marker here. Source Walter Edgar the preeminent SC scholar south carolina  a historyGenerally youll probably see a lot more pride for the confederacy than out there. Its not in your face just memorials and CSA grave sites. your friends werent kidding about the food much of it is very highcalorie. Coupled with low exercise rates as throughout the south and EXTREMELY hot and humid weather and total dependence on cars for transportation obesity is endemic. interesting to note that the other USMC boot camp besides camp Pendleton in San Diego is in Parris island south of charleston. SC also has the biggest army base in the US fort Jackson east of columbia.  casinos are illegal in SC. The only casinos are ships that leave from a city on the NC border north of myrtle beach and head into international waters.  the state has an incredible amount of biodiversity  it may be the most biodiverse state in the union debatable. First is the coast which is subtropical then the coastal plateau then the midlandsSandhills then Piedmont then a small portion of the blue ridge mountains. California may have more terrain diversity  SC does not have rainforest though neither does CA or any sort of desert but there is an incredible number of different types of flora and birds in particular. youll probably notice government differences  the state spends significantly less on infrastructure but also taxes significantly less. gas prices are EXTREMELY cheap compared to California. That youll like.  many many trailer parks. Most in the nation. religion is big here. All Im gonna say about that. when cars break down  people hang tshirts in the window. Youll see it often and its weird. SC is NOT a hour state. Things close at night and on Sundays good luck  really almost everything thats inessential is closed . gun culture is big here. A law is about to go into effect that allows concealed carry in bars and restaurants. Georgetown county at one pointth century had the most slaves in the us as the rice plantations just inland from the Atlantic and on the waccamaw river were kings of the NATIONAL economy. once you get out of the cities it gets EXTREMELY rural and small town. if youre not located right off a major interstate north charleston is it will take you longer to drive anywhere than you think. Most of the state and us highways go through tiny cities and slow down dramatically. there is NO RUSH here in anything. Dont be shocked if at the grocery store the cashier and a customer in front of you finish a conversation for a few minutes before youre helped. drivers will often wait a few seconds when a light turns green to start moving.  SC is COMPLETELY CARDEPENDENT. It can often be LIFETHREATENING to bike on roads here as drivers do NOT respect bikers. edits fort moultrie not Sullivan  ft Jackson is east of Columbia not south And added a few other things,southcarolina,cf4c2su,29,t5_2qr5g

I usually get your accent isnt southern! which is true my accent is a mix of neutral Midwest southern Ohio and Northeast. My wife usually gets You have a lovely accent! Her accent is sort of a gentileupstate accent. Sort of like a less pronounced Lindsey Graham. Anyhow unless someone has a real REAL thick accent I havent observed really any different treatment.  I have seen smart people with thick accents treated as though theyre stupid but that was here in SC. ,southcarolina,ct17qv0,8,t5_2qr5g

5495448,0,t3_3qctr5,This came close to happening at a highschool I attended in SC. This girl probably thought she was hot shit by disobeying an officer after being told to vacate the classroom Luckily the teacher in my class went into depth and told the student that by not leaving when told she would be trespassing and officers would be called. My classmate decided it would be best to leave rather than be arrested.I really dont think that this is a case of violence with the cop. If she didnt leave when told and was stubborn enough to resist an officer what else could he have done? Shrug and tell the teacher to deal with it?

The area I think you are taking about we call this more Arcadia lakes I believe was pretty badly affected by the flooding. But depending on where exactly your work is you can get just about anywhere in  minutes in the Cola metro area so you have options. Typically people buy rather than rent an apartment because it is really just cheaper to buy a bd home than it is to rent an apartment. And renting a house can be astronomical too because the taxes are so much higher.  But if you are expecting to move in the next couple years there are certain areas you want to be mindful of because of their low resale value. ,southcarolina,cwns67e,1,t5_2qr5g

6458449,0,t1_czmouem,I voted for Hillary in the  primary and was prepared to vote for her again this year until Sanders announced he was running as well.  My feeling was that I was settling for Hillary not because I trusted her to do anything spectacular but because I didnt want to go third party this year and chance one of the hyperevangelical republican candidates winning the presidency.  But once I started looking into what Sanders wants to do even if it does feel a little pie in the sky I just couldnt go back to settling for Hillary for the primary.  He talks about changing our policies to be a country that I want for my kids.  The income inequality is just a given reality college is barely affordable even when you can get a patchwork of grants or high rate loans to pay for it theres no guaranteed paternitymaternity leave and just the premium not including the deductible when I actually have to use it for my health insurance accounts for over  of my paycheck.  I just cant get behind a candidate like Hillary who claims wanting to reform the financial sector and the skyrocketing college costs when shes also collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from both places.  I know its considered standard practice but I dont think it should be considered that way anymore.  Of course I dont think the road to his proposed changes will be easy but Id like to try.  When it comes down to the general if its Hillary against the GOP Ill cast my vote for her then mainly because otherwise I shudder to think of what Supreme Court justices would be chosen by a politician who believes that religion comes first over the law.  ,southcarolina,cznchzw,5,t5_2qr5g

7637578,0,t3_4jvceq,While Im prochoice there was an interesting podcast episode from Radiolab called  Weeks  Days where they talked about all of the medical improvements weve made with preemies and that gradually hospitals can save babies born more and more prematurely than ever. Like when the Roe v Wade decision originally came out it allowed abortions up to what  weeks? And that was because after that the baby could survive if it was removed from the womb. But these days some doctors claim that babies born even more prematurely like  weekolds can even possibly be saved if removed from the womb. So even apart from religious folks who are prolife it is interesting that the abortion ban could possibly be scaled back to like  weeks because of medical advancements. Not saying thats the reason SC did it lol prob not but it is another way of looking at this issue.,southcarolina,d3aclq9,5,t5_2qr5g

I think the choice of abortion should  be left up to the woman but I also think men get the short end of the stick when it comes to these things.
