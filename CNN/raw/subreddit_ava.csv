9421392,0,t3_55kwc0,This is pretty pointless you cant get rid of cheaters just like that.You got to keep in mind that it would cause whay more trouble if they banned legit people every games devs struggle with this and there will always be cheaters.Wait for the next ESL Versus season for ava if that ever happens again. That wont get rid of all the cheaters but will definitely filter some of them out.AVA is an old game which makes it easy for coders to crack it and Xigncode isnt the best anticheat either it can easily be bypassed. Nothing will change for that matter  but thats because they cant change it.They cant ban people just because people think theyre cheating there needs to be solid proof which is a lot harder to provide than most of the community might think.,ava,d9a85u5,1,t5_2qzbw
