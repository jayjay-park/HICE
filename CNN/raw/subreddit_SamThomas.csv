Description A fleshy organic core surrounded by an advanced cybernetic body. The vast majority choose to look humanoid in appearance  arms  legs and a head but they can switch out bodies to suit their needs ex a miner would switch into a large drilling machine body while working then back to a humanoid form when his shift is over.  Other There are two other races within the Sector Humans and Cybrians. The Ascendants were originally human and the humans that are left in the Sector are the descendants of those who didnt want Cybernetic enhancements. They all reside on Exul. The Cybrians are an entirely robotic race of A.I. that were discovered on Exul. The humans that discovered the Cybrians used their technology to become The Ascendants. Only a handful of Cybrians are still functional. They reside within the Legion Lord Core so they might share their wisdom with The Ascendants.,SamThomas,ckbr8l3,3,t5_2zhh9
