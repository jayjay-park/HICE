1486807,0,t3_28rqxj,Start with a picnic bench they are the best things to practice with in my opinion. look up some tutorials Jesse laFlair has incrabily detailed ones and use those to learn how to do some vaults. I would suggest starting with the speed vault then the kong then a reverse. also look into a dash vault because while I do not enjoy them to much others can do them better then kongs. this is a lot of information to start with but depending on your athletic ability and amount of practice you can learn these tricks in a couple of months. Oh also to make it easier start by doing all the vaults going the short way of the picnic bench.,Freerun,cj2n9rf,1,t5_2sv18
