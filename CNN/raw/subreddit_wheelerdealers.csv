10267027,0,t3_5n0aeo,I wouldnt be surprised if theyre leaving Atta Boy and Wheeler Dealers to work directly for Discovery and Velocity with a new show of some kind maybe with their own production company like the Top Gear guys did.  Theyve been in the US so much for the past few years and Velocity keeps bringing them to Barret Jackson to do commentary and interviews. Discovery obviously likes them a lot.Edit a few hours after I made this comment I saw a commercial for the upcoming Los Angeles car show on Velocity with appearances by a bunch of Velocity hosts including Mike Brewer Chip Foose Wayne Carini and some others. Mike still seems to be affiliated with VelocityDiscovery.  ,wheelerdealers,dc7tnse,8,t5_2wq7y
