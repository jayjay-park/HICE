371169,0,t1_cfj8bjd,Poisonous and venomous have different meanings though. For example the dart frog is poisonous as in it has glands on the external portion of its skin that can cause a reaction if touched or ingested. A spider has venom glands that secrete venom whenever it bites into its prey. One is used as defense the other is used for offense. There is quite a difference. And the markings are fine a dock spider is in the same family as a Nursery Web spider just different genus. Either way they are all harmless. ,spiders,cfj8jkc,8,t5_2r1sf

451448,0,t3_1z8t3w,ujoot and I have had several long drawn out discussions about this search and you shall find There have been no reported deaths from black widow spider bites in the United States for decades.  There are a few in the last  years assigned to brown recluse. But your question actual spider bite needs some arachnologist involved and few are. So a death attribution death certificate does not require formal proof. Add the large number of wounds misattributed to brown recluse and the frequent misidentification of harmless spiders and you get deaths misattributed to brown recluse.  So how come no widow deaths? Well widow spiders are easy to identify and the syndrome less confused with other diseases.,spiders,cfrktop,1,t5_2r1sf

1890820,0,t1_ckgzl4g,Having a male inside doesnt necessarily mean that theres a female inside. Widows generally dont live indoors. They are timid spiders that prefer to take up residence in undisturbed places. Mature males on the other hand wander in search of females so its possible for one to come inside once in a while.Male widows are harmless. Personally I wouldnt kill it.If possible find a location where people arent likely to encounter it. Suitable release locations are anywhere that would make good widow habitatgt In nature it is a fairly common spider most species are found in recesses under rocks or logs in a woodpile in crevices or holes in dirt embankments in dark sheltered spots and in barns amp outbuildings where it builds strongwalled retreats quite close to the ground.gt gt However they readily adapt to humanaltered environments and are most commonly found in outbuildings sheds barns privies water meter holes nursery cans around lids of dust bins around seats of outdoor privies spaces under chips of wood around stacked materials of any kind in deserted animal burrows or rodent holes entwined in grape arbors and under any item or structure e.g. barbeque grill slide sand box that has been undisturbed for a lengthy period. Additionally in the eastern United States Latrodectus mactans is associated with littered areas with dumps of large cities with garages and storage sheds. In arid parts of Arizona this spider inhabits almost every crevice in the soil and its nests are found in cholla cacti and agave plants.,spiders,ckh1acd,2,t5_2r1sf

Sometimes people do connect two unrelated things like a sore spot and a spider in the same room later that dayand thats way less convincing. It could also be that a supersensitive area near the tear ducts might produce a way worse reaction than where most people get bit in the hands and feet. Im not really sure but none of the things this spider looks like Amaurobiidae Metaltella ought to be a real danger. Of course youll probably see both black and brown widows in the SD area Edit to add but not recluses which dont occur that far westyou may be mistaking another species for a recluse? and those you definitely want to keep far away from your son.

I fall back on the comparison to a beewasp sting since most people are familiar with it  itll hurt maybe for a few days but it isnt a big problem unless youre allergic or otherwise sensitive.

As a recovered arachnophobe I can attest that for me all it took to get over my fears and become an arachnophile was increasing my awareness and familiarity with spiders. I read about spiders. I learned which species lived in my area which species were potentially dangerous and which were not which is almost all of them! I learned how the potentially dangerous ones black widows behave and just how shy and nonaggressive they really are. And I started keeping spiders as pets. Baby spiders are cute and nonthreatening so I started small  a widow egg sac and a baby tarantula. When you watch them grow up before your eyes its really hard to be frightened of them. It is also nearly impossible not to become fascinated with them as you watch them feed and grow and change. By the time my little widow hatchling was fullgrown my view of her had done a complete  from seeing her as a deadly spider that must be squashed to seeing her as a beautiful creature that deserves respect. She has since died  widows not being terribly longlived  but that baby tarantula is fullgrown and shares her room with a whole bunch of assorted spiders and other arthropods all caged separately of course. ,spiders,coc4mhe,11,t5_2r1sf

3412567,0,t1_cph71yp,Without a doubt I agree. I grew up in Moreno Valley I was always mindful and never scared for my well being as I had education regarding my favorite spider. Its just a safer bet to be proactive widows are in no danger of being wiped out and simply killing the individual will help this person sleep without fear.OP all the points that are in this thread are valid.  Do what you will but keep in mind that you can share a house with a widow as long as youre mindful. Do try to verify the identity of the spider first though if you want more Internet friends and points. Its rather unlikely that you have a genuine black widow but until identified caution is hardly a bad idea. ,spiders,cph9a4x,1,t5_2r1sf

4414060,0,t3_3blb88,First spiders dont just bite for no reason.  They dont wander around and go hmm this looks like flesh NOM.  They eat bugs.  Black widows are shy creatures who hide in dark corners  females typically pick one spot and stay there their whole lives and only females are medically significant. gt Im scared that if I go to sleep I might not wake up.Secondly this is not how black widow bites work.  They bite to convey WTF stop squashing me!  The whole purpose of biting would be for you to notice them and make you stop doing whatever offensive threatening thing you are doing.  If you are a bitten its gonna hurt.  The primary symptom of widow bite is muscle cramping.  Have you ever gotten a charlie horse when your calf muscle seizes?  Like that but not going away for a couple days.  And sweating your ass off.  You would know it and have plenty of time to get to the emergency room where you could get antivenin which has prevented anyone from being killed by a widow in more than  years where it is available.  But understand this even with NO treatment if youre a healthy adult you would probably be fine.But youre not getting bitten so you can stop worrying...,spiders,csn76q4,3,t5_2r1sf

All the reported deaths I am aware of happened when antivenin was not available. Without antivenin people whose lives are in danger from a bite usually get calcium gluconate ... which does jack.  My point is that those deaths happening where antivenin isnt available is not a coincidence.  The reason we dont have deaths in places with antivenin is that antivenin works.  To prevent death.  Yes fatal bites are RARE  I already said that.  And because death is rare the purpose of antivenin is USUALLY only to prevent pain and suffering.  I will restate there is a an important difference between RARE and NOT HAPPENING.

In one study of  Phoneutria bites in coastal Brazil only . of the victims required antivenom and the only death was one small child. Although there is an obvious major concern when children are bitten most bite victims experienced minor problems without longlasting effects and certainly not death. Most of the bites were in adults minor symptoms resolved without complications.Thats really cool!

6932826,0,t3_4aohhd,Yes Ive kept woodlouse hunters before. They are fast and at least in my experience go into a defensive posture fairly readily when provoked raising their front legs and displaying their fangs. When Ive kept them its so I can show them to my students  and these spiders are pretty shy preferring to hide underneath rocks leaves debris or whatever substrate is in their enclosure. In order to show them to the kids I have to gently remove that protective covering  and they dont much like that. I wouldnt call them aggressive  more like timid and skittish  but I dont pick em up in my bare hands either. Not all of them go into the threat posture  some curl up as small as possible and try to hide instead. If you put one in your terrarium I suspect that you wont see it very often  though it may help to regulate your pill bug population at least somewhat. They dont seem to be voracious eaters so it may take a while to put much of a dent in the population  and the pill bugs may be capable of reproducing faster than theyre getting eaten.,spiders,d125u0w,3,t5_2r1sf

All the spider needs is one thread to span the opening then it can run across to reinforce the line with stronger silk. The next step is the kicker with one thread across the opening the spider can choose the anchor site that is most favorable for the web to be suspended properly.

9719880,0,t3_5e7ecs,Ive kept a wolf spider theyre pretty low maintenance. My experience Food crickets houseflies anything its size or smaller should be fine. Beetles and isopods might be too tough. For flying insects catch them under a cup and pop them in the fridge for a few minutes to briefly knock them out makes for easier transfer. If it isnt going for the prey take it out if possible for the spiders safety and offer it again later.  My spider was about the same size and ate every couple weeks.   Shelter They like having something to hide on but also something to stand on top of. They may molt in their shelter so make sure its not too small.   Water I used a wet cotton ball changed out frequently. If you choose to mist the enclosure they will drink water droplets off the side very cool to watch watch out for mold!   Cleaning I periodically had to clean the enclosure because she trailed silk everywhere and left insect remains lying around. I made a smaller temporary habitat to transfer her into. Dont try to handle it it might escape just shoo it into a little cup or something. Temperature wise they probably dont need babying. They can handle freezing weather at least  Celsius.Have fun keep us posted!,spiders,dab6q78,3,t5_2r1sf

10291704,0,t3_5ndlds,Nice! That notsolittle beauty appears to be a Mama huntsman spider  and unless Im mistaken she is clutching an egg sac full of her future offspring! These lovely spiders are beneficial predators that will control other bugs for you  and they are not dangerous to humans beyond the risk of heart attack if you have a weak heart to begin with and are startled by the giant spider in your bathroom! See for example Heteropoda venatoria or a close relative.Comparison pictures one two,spiders,dcamcep,71,t5_2r1sf
10299596,0,t3_5ndlds,Update Thanks for the help everyone! The spider is now safely relocated egg sack and all to the nearby garden downstairs by means of broom and dustpan.,spiders,dcbijpa,26,t5_2r1sf

10639386,0,t1_ddcaujh,Do not guess medically significant spiders. Funnel web spiders are grounddwelling and do not hang in webs. This spider is not even in the same suborder.  This is Badumna a common and harmless Australian house spider.,spiders,ddddddh,2,t5_2r1sf
10697219,0,t3_5szn8e,Do not release this. You risk introducing a new invasive species. Its very illegal to bring it into the US if youre in the US even by accident.I dont think anyone will be able to ID it with that photo. How about you preserve it in some alcohol so you can get a more close up shot?,spiders,ddjc75i,7,t5_2r1sf
10731065,0,t3_5titbm,Spiders dont need a great deal of air. Ive kept black widows in  oz. plastic water bottles with the lid screwed on tight and no air holes to keep the babies from escaping and never had a problem. The only time the lid is removed is when I feed them. Small household spiders can also get by without drinking water as most of them get their moisture from their food. While three weeks is quite a while for a small spider to go without food if it had recently eaten prior to being captured it isnt an extraordinary amount of time. I typically feed my pet spiders every week or two and they do just fine on that schedule. Tarantulas will routinely fast for weeks or even months prior to molting though for a small household spider Id say three weeks was probably pushing the limits a bit.,spiders,ddmtuzg,7,t5_2r1sf

11227775,0,t1_df4547w,Wow! Ive never seen a male so big! This makes a lot more sense though. We have a female house spider weve been feeding and stealing the egg sacs of to release the spiderlings to disperse outside after hatching living in our master bathroom which is on the other side of the wall from the kitchen. Most of her mates were about half the size of this guy. I know I didnt provide any size reference. The spider wouldnt hold still for even a second and was meandering drunkenly. It was hard to even get reasonably clear photos. It was about the size of a quarter including the legs so I suppose just the body was probably at least mm.,spiders,df4njf3,1,t5_2r1sf
11244051,0,t1_df6gf3h,Im all for them and their right to exist but having a wild and unexpected spider the width of your hand charging at lightning speed at your face isnt cool no matter how much you like them.

11744098,0,t3_67i81j,Thats a male and hes not yet full grown. You can tell by what look like a pair of water balloons at the front  his immature pedipalps. In a molt or two those will turn into dark sclerotized apparatus used for mating. He has no egg sacs just a nice shelter in some debris. On his back I see a pattern like this which puts him in genus Theridion. ,spiders,dgr81se,3,t5_2r1sf
