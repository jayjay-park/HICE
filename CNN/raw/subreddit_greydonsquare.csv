1391352,0,t3_29x9lw,I deleted my first comment after I thought about this some more. There is a definite culture of authority with police and Im not sure how necessary this is. Theres this front of intimidation thats put on and its that intimidation Ive seen used to get people to surrender their rights... and it kinda makes me wonder why it has to be like that. Theres also this response that well cops are out there every day putting their lives on the line. You dont know what its like... And I get that. But then we have to ask on the spectrum of policy from favoring police to favoring civilians... do we want the err to lie on the side of shoot first?  ,greydonsquare,ciqoqpk,1,t5_2yurd

3873777,0,t1_cqxu0vc,Right you understand they are meant to be minicasts right? Not actual podcasts with full length interviews. This is meant to be my unfiltered thoughts. I have another situation for interviews and things like that. But I dont want to interview anyone. Its just ot really what Im interested in to. . ,greydonsquare,cqxuds9,3,t5_2yurd
