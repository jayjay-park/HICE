9886562,0,t3_5gzju9,gt How could I use this in my workplace?Youre right. There is no answer yet. Its in early development and not ready for production applications. Just start building stuff with it. Turn that into frameworkslibraries. Rails came from the code that build Basecamp it didnt come crashing down.Dont just rewrite. Solve problems you have with Crystal instead of Ruby. Especially problems where Ruby is limited. Otherwise people will see no use anyway.,crystal_programming,daw8q68,2,t5_343bz
9910299,0,t3_5gzju9,Late to the party but...What Crystal needs is a larger community and more development speed. Go is getting so much better with every release and same goes for rust. These languages are in competition with Crystal but have huge communities and developer teams and are backed by large companies. How can crystal compete with that? Only by attracting more people into the ecosystem.,crystal_programming,dazc2oz,2,t5_343bz
9922506,0,t1_db0wkh9,Weve explained to you time after time why crystal works in the way it does in regards to union types. If you are unable to accept it as correct you might as well go and use a dynamic language.Creating a recursive dynamic structure in any statically typed language will always end up with either creating a common interface over scalar sequence mapping or loads of casting.,crystal_programming,db0xeae,2,t5_343bz
