2701444,0,t3_2i05u3,There is a difference between a minor proxy a guy with a flamer standing in for the melta guy an major ones  like that kid .. Minor proxy is widely accepted in most groupsclubsstores but you should still ask if they are ok with it. Major proxy should really only be used with friends. And play test a model is dumb . you should already know what it is strong against an what it will struggle with. Having a physical model makes no difference in how the dice are rolled an what it can do. But this is just my opinion,40k,cnb56pr,3,t5_2su24
5724675,0,t3_3thja7,Im doing the same thing Im using the Calth boxset to start an Ultramarines k army. Heres my take  squads of tactical Marines with no heavy or special weapons Terminator squad and contemptor then buying two more squads of separate tactical sprues and making two  man heavy support squads one with the sprues Missile Launchers one with Heavy Bolters and two  man tactical support squads with flamers and meltaguns these squads dont exist in k in your case Id maybe make the other ten Marines into an Assault Squad.That way it makes the core of your army a solid mass of Marines with the tactical flexibility of some supporting heavy weapons and an assault squad. All you really need after that is some more dreadnoughts maybe some armour definitely some Rhinos or Razorbacks. Re the weapons for the Terminators Id honestly magnetise the arms. Is really worth it because they come with the options for a full squad of Lightning Claws or Chainfists or Power Fists. Sometimes you need a terminator assault squad sometimes you need antiarmour sometimes just a solid tactical squad. Or you could just get  Calth box sets! ,40k,cx6pach,1,t5_2su24

6841992,0,t3_43976r,I would say go to eBay and look up the tau battle box.  A piranha meh stealth team awesome simply for the  cover save out in the open more crisis suits not body guards as they are  pts more expensive and fire warriors always the strike team.  A cadre is a must as it gives you a bonus shot at full range and an additional at half range if they dont move rapid fire is  inches for fire warriors not ....three shots per model!. Later on a commander broadsides riptide and hammerhead in no particular order.  Magnets are your friend.,40k,d0rufn0,1,t5_2su24

7150649,0,t1_d1qq98o,pretty good questions. OP can really carve deeper dramatic effect with one thing that makes the audience connect with a story is a main character. this should be the chapter master. apply the usual questions to developing him who is he? where has he been? how did he get here to his place of office? why should we care about him? what is the chapter masters ideal vision of the imperium? many writers will use the chapter master as a core then go on to use chapter command as secondary supporting characters. librarian chaplain tech marine etc.  the setting is not as important in k as other genres because its already so fleshed out. in my opinion the homeworld information should be limited as most k readersplayers are drowned in a sea of bullshit where new planets are thrown at them every other sentence. however the homeworld should tie in a few of their traits that make them unique from other SM chapters. edit i think the best way this can be avoided is to have a destroyed homeworld so the chapter is thrusted into the k setting and the homeworld is used purely for character building.  how by the book does chapter command follow orders during campaigns? what kind of relationships does the chapter have with their home world and other branches of the imperium? and the opposite how does the imperium view them and why? bad blood with other loyalists is always a good sell for k audiences most commonplace being during the course of a campaign one chapter taking a lot heavier casualties than another and this pisses a lot of people off.  lots of times k writers will just straight up steal ww  ww stories and inject them into k. and those stories are hugely popular so feel free to go ahead and do that.  a mistake to avoid going into mindless dribble about battles. i see many k players fall into this trap where they really want to tell the audience about every really cool game theyve had so they list too many and they are lost in a mess of details. the reason why they list notable battles in codexes is a showcase of the armys character progression. regardless of how much shit everyone talks about matt ward his listing of battles in the necron codex was an excellent example many of the different battles listed painted a clear picture of the kind of progression the necrons have experienced since their reawakening.  just remember the ageold advice Is this the most interesting part of your characters chapters life? If not why arent you showing us that?fortunately since you are writing about space marines you have a large pool of potential drama to draw from creatures from the warp are pulling the librarians in one direction see all dawn of war plots the administratuminquisitionAMsystem governors are pulling chapter command in another direction see lots of BFG and epic  plots etc.if you want to PM me any rough drafts id be happy to offer constructive feedback. good luck!,40k,d1qygap,2,t5_2su24

7905576,0,t3_4njs04,Varies friend from author to author and from threat to threat. Citizens would have zero knowledge of necrons as most of the time the guard and occasionally marines dont know what the deuce necrons are.Orks are common knowledge theyve been a pain since the the well before the Great Crusade and probably earlier. Eldar also probably more common because of piracy and that theyve been around for as long as mankind in space.Tau unless your a citizen on the Eastern Fringe probably unknown.Nids probably vary. Ultramar obviosly know. Anywhere near where a hive fleet went probably knows. And id imagine the stories are widespread over the imperium by now.For all the threats I think the level of he knowledge increases with rank. Common citizens have all these things as boogeymen that the Emperors Angels need to go smite. Planetary Govenors rogue traders and other ranking citizens likely have better knowledge.Note about the Grey Knights Yes theyll kill any guard they fight with they also mind wipe any marines they fight with. The only exception are the Space Wolves. Thats an interesting story.,40k,d44nulb,3,t5_2su24

11309557,0,t3_61ehvf,The only thing that formation changes is command bonus  special rules. If You where to run a list of units from a formation as an unbound army it would behave exactly the same as if You where to field them as formation  only it would not gain the command bonus  special rules from it.So no  unless specifically stating that in formation rulesrestrictions it does not affect unit placement coherency joining or leaving other units etc. They are not separate entities on the battlefield apart from putting boundaries on the scope of their respective command bonus  special rules. The formation may have their own restrictions on how they can be fielded or rules how to treat units that are part of it. For example Tau Ethereal Council have special rules says they are single unit and treated as characters instead of independent characters. At the same time Taus The Eight is just a formation of  independent characters as there is no rules governing this aspect of gameplay in he formation rules. This does not stop player from fielding them as single unit just like You can field ICs as single unit under regular rules but You are not forced too like in the case of Ethereal Council.Formation can govern how the units are fielded. For example TAU Rapid Insertion Forces govern which unit of this formation starts the game in deep strike and which starts the game on the battlefield. Player Have no choice in this example and have to follow the rules. ,40k,dfdx64e,2,t5_2su24
