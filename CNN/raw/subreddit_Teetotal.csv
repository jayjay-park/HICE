I know I might be considered too young to be teetotal but my halfsisters life went down the drain from alcohol and drug abuse so I really dont think Ill ever be tempted.,Teetotal,ceu2wuw,8,t5_2srks

8179542,0,t3_4r2y0c,Okay. First of all I genuinely see where youre coming from. I created this sub in the hopes of finding people who felt like I did which at the time was much like how you feel. Can I ask how old you are? I will tell you from personal experience that it gets better as you and your peer group get older. It feels to you like drinking and drugs are everywhere and theyve taken over other peoples lives and that may be true for now but that will improve as everyone matures.gt  Could I be with a woman who during an average conversation would keep saying Sorry babe Im ridiculously high right now. What were we talking about again?I think thats a question you have to answer for yourself. Its perfectly fine to decide that you dont want to be in a relationship with someone who doesnt drink or do drugs. I felt the same way and I got really lucky in finding my spouse. Your post sounds to me like a lot of frustration regarding the prevalence of alcohol and drug use in our society which is absolutely something that most of us struggle with around here but also in large part with the difficulties in finding a significant other. Thats something that most people struggle with in life for a lot of reasons and doubly so when youre teetotal AND not willing to be in a relationship with someone who isnt totally sober. It is absolutely hard to find people who arent ever involved with taking mindaltering substances but we are out there. Dating sites arent a bad idea but Id say you need to be really upfront about your intentions well before meeting your potential dates. Make sure before meeting that they understand your needs regarding an potential relationship and if theyre drinkerssmokers just move on. Most importantly and Ive learned this one the hard way dont judge them. Dont judge anybody to their face. Even if you feel the same way I do which is that drugtaking and alcohol use are the dumbest evilest most abhorrent behaviors that exist among everyday society keep it to yourself. People dont like being judged and even if you feelknow that youre absolutely correct theyll get their backs up and get angry. Im currently in a situation where Ive had to cut a family member out of my life while shes young and is more concerned with drinking than with having a relationship with me. Im hopeful that shell come around when shes older and more mature but the one thing that wont help the situation is me arguing with her about her drinking. Telling her its evil and suicidal and scares me to death every day hasnt gotten me anywhere and I guess it never will. People in general arent going to understand or sympathize with how you feel and trying to make them do so is a losing battle. You need to focus on yourself how youre feeling and working out coping mechanisms for getting through a world in which you dont quite fit. But everyone has to navigate that teetotal or not.,Teetotal,d4zzq0q,3,t5_2srks

10881587,0,t1_de21npe,Well if its that foreign to a sober person and such a completely new way of being conscious then yeah not interested haha. If I cant anticipate all the radically new information coming in from my brain and I cant compare it to anything Im familiar with Im going to be terrified and probably have a panic attack. People are brave! I cant relate.,Teetotal,de2cwto,1,t5_2srks
