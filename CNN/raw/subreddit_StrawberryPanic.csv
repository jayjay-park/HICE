173721,0,t1_cexeiqm,Correct. Please buy it. It goes directly to Seven Seas entertainment who did the translations. Buy the one novel that has all  volumes.In Japan there exists  volumes in the light novel series. What happened is that they Seven Seas released Vol  and Vol  in English but due to poor sales they never came out with a rd one. They eventually finished it in  but instead of releasing it to the public as one small rd volume which wouldnt have practically sold at all they sold it in one large light novel that contains all  of them.Heres pictures of my copies of Japanese and English light novels amp mangas. Sorry I dont have the nd light novel volume in English available. Its probably packed away right now  remember the rd light novel in English doesnt exist.Side view light novels on left mangas on right     Light Novels Front coverEngTopJPBot     Light Novels Back coverEngTopJPBot    Mangas Front coverEngTopJPBot         Mangas Back coverEngTopJPBot    volume Manga Front coverEnglish    volume Manga Back coverEnglish    As for your second question Im going to have to say no. This was established around . The problem is the light novel and manga is all over the place. Its not very good. Strawberry Panic! was meant to be trashy sleazy story. The problem is that the anime was utterly brilliant in its delivery! The reason you wont see a rerelease is because of the abysmal performance of the manga and light novels. The light novels are pretty WTF with a lot of weird moments but I still liked it.I strongly recommend reading the wikipedia article on Strawberry Panic! Theres so much good information there.,StrawberryPanic,cey7x5t,1,t5_2u8hc
