Were all web developersprogrammers. Two of our guys are working on a Foosball app a web app currently that can be used on iOS Android amp Windows Phone to keep stats etc. Id happily share that app here in beta to a few once we get all the bugs and such fleshed out if that sparks anyones interest.,foosball,cf53al8,2,t5_2qx3n

2593260,0,t1_cmx26so,Fortunately for me I attend a university that has about  of the student body living on campus and it is uncommon for students to go home over the weekend.  We have a pretty strong party atmosphere with a focus on community building.  So I luckily do not have to worry about planning these events on weeknights.Also I really want the community outside of just the university to become active in this ideal foosball scenario which would be difficult to do if it was not held on weekends simply because I fear people with jobs will not have the time.And oddly enough my university does have a table in their lounge area in the student union.  However I inspected it and noticed there is some warping near each goal where the field seems to have become convex in those areas.  I still might try to use it for gathering interest in this plan but it is just not the most ideal table.  And I have a table in my house at college as well but the field is also a bit warped where it all sort of slopes into the center of the field instead of remaining flat.You are definitely right about people enjoying just watching the game and relaxing.  That is one of the coolest parts about the sport aside from it allowing practically anyone to be competitive in it.  I also think you are right about the  players part.  Maybe instead of going to  we could go to  to circulate people through the table faster.,foosball,cmx2r6r,2,t5_2qx3n

When I play girls or guys even for fun i try to spot them points to where its always hard.  Like I give my mixed partner  points and the drop and if she wins i get the drop. That way they get to talk trash also and keeps its fun. ,foosball,cp8q3vg,2,t5_2qx3n
