42297,0,t3_1ukp0e,Since the price has come down I think its a great buy if you like the scale look I do!. We had one in the shop and I had a lot of fun with it  its not crazy fast given the motorbattery combo but its quick enough and nimble enough to be worth what you spend.  Personally I would love a chance to drive it in sand because it would look fantastic with that iconic body.  Since its Duratrax you wont have as much aftermarket support as some other brands but Id love to get one and scale detail it out.  I say go for it.,rccars,cej8vu0,2,t5_2stj0

143489,0,t1_ceuhusp, is just the size of the can correct?  This is the size I need to fit the motor mount?  What would you recommend for a backup motor in this range?  The Traxxas ESC VXLs cant use a pole so I must stick to a pole motor.  Furthermore How can I tell if the vehicle I just bought has the new or old VXL motor?  I ask because the other option would be to rebuild the motor over time although its new now so NO NEED TO but the rebuild kits have two different options.  I believe the biggest change is the size of the bearings in the new motor are bigger.,rccars,ceurvnw,1,t5_2stj0

That being said there will only be an offset of mm on the rear end with the HPI VTA tires.  The current supported bodies account for this and the car will look fine.

887861,0,t3_249w29,I find the best treatment to be dependent on what tire brand and compound. For example my m proline treatment is to brush with paragon and then leave overnight. Then I use a product called Traction X made and sold by Todd Putnam. Finally about a race and half before Im up i brush on clear HyTraction Juice. The stuff is like glue. The other key is to make whats called a tiretub its a lunchbox or pencil box with a brush screwed and glued to the bottom then you fill that with simple green and warm water. This removes all the dirt applies simple green doesnt get any water in the tire and doesnt remove the traction compound because very little water is used. Obviously what works on your track is dependent on the track but remember some additives soften some just make your tire sticky and you should combine the two. And a toothbrush is a great way to apply compound without applying too much. ,rccars,ch57bna,1,t5_2stj0

I thought it was the diff or the slipper I just could not put the power to the ground. I changed everything. diffs. slippers. motors sensor wires. everything. Anyway I was changing my motor over to a . running it stock this season and it started flashing the blue green code at me after it wouldnt engage. turn the motor over by hand. works again then  seconds later green and blue code again. tested it with  seperate sensor wires. Not the problem. Tried soldering two motors I knew where fine. same problem.I had a hobbywing Xerun . I got off a guy and all of a sudden my power issues are gone. My trans sounds good. Smooth delivery of power. I have tried every setting with a pulse sent Charlie emails on what Ive been doing wrong and yet after they shit themselves I replaced one with a RS Pro and it was a totally different car to drive. I put the hobbywing on this one and I have also put a LRP Flow on the other one.So Im not just anecdoteally bashing Novak for fun Im coming from experience.

I also made sure it did penetrate the rubber but careful not to touch the foam thats quite easy to do. Then attached two wheels to the Summit held it up by its rear bumper so its pointing down and gradually increased the throttle and hey presto it works! I could see spray on my paving so I could monitor how much water was coming out I kept doing that until I could not see much water at all. I would say run each pair for about  minutes at half throttle but bursting to full throttle for a few seconds. This really did the trick. Thanks folks.,rccars,cn1bb3a,1,t5_2stj0

Always hurts the pocketbook and makes the hobby just that little bit less enjoyable.Despite it being totaled you should consider talking to someone at traxxas and explaining the situation to them to see if they have any idea what could have caused it. It certainly sounds like some kind of radio glitch like a receiver problem of some sort low battery voltage or something like that maybe a vibration caused it to freak out.

2712768,0,t3_2r362y,with the brushed motors these trucks have your not likely to break much. they are pretty tough and should fair pretty well in crashes even at full speed. Now when you upgrade to brushless motor and lipo batteries your gonna break all sorts of shit lol..either way here is a list of stuff i commonly breakupgrade on most of my trucks.  Aarms...go with RPM   shock towers...go with RPMI suggest because even though aluminum stuff is pretty it usually only last  good crash and its bent all to hell  bumpers... TBone bumpers are the best RC product i have ever dealt with. They are the hardest damn thing to break on my rigs and if you do manage to break one all you gotta do is send them a pic of the broken part and theyll send you a new one free of charge...not even shipping.   steering links...i make them most of the time using all thread and brake line. but the aluminum ones from traxxas are good.  wheelstires...I like proline...newgood tires will make it a whole new truck and pretty much a must when you go brushlesslipoIf you guys are just bashers i highly suggest you coat the underside of your body with drywall tape and shoe goo. It will dramatically increase the life of your lid.   motorbattery...this is by far the most expensive upgrade but also the most worth wild. your truck will be twice as powerful and the run times will go also. the Traxxas VXL upgrade for this truck is good as far as batteries i usually shop around. I have many different brands and am satisfied with the performance from most of them. Just remember to do some reading and youll be able to weed out the junk pretty easy. Also when you go lipo youll need to pick up a lipo specific charger aswell. ,rccars,cncfirn,3,t5_2stj0

I have both and frequently run the let my brother drive my wd Stampede and he gets mad because he just cant go where I go.  I know the wd cost a few bucks more but consider Im going to be sending you a free LiPo s worth  and the fact that the wd just kicks total ass and is absolutely worth getting if you can afford or you will regret not getting a wd.  The wd is still a great machine but my stampede with a set of Trencher tires.Items you will need to purchase along with your RC . s LiPo andor s LiPo later. Wil send free Onyx s if you get a new RC....I have too many random S LiPos laying around.  If you get a stampede x I will send you a really nicecool upgrade for it . A simple LiPo balance charger. This one i a great starter charger and Im happy with my own.  You can move on to a more advanced charger down the road if you thing you need more. You are technically supposed to charge the battery LiPo saftey bag like this one but any old ammo can or safe metal container will work. LiPo batteries can sometimes burstblowupget fireyetc.  Please us linked safety bag.  I have always used an older steel ammo can and have yet to have any incidents  You can run the Onyx battery on the budget Duratrax charger twice a day for  months and you will not have an accident.  Properly charging a LiPo battery is very simple to learn. Im not a lawyer Doctor or Priest  . A set of these Hex Drivers are an absolute requrement. You can spen . less and get a but you see how much more you get for only .  I would have bought that Duratrax hex kit if I knew it existed. Amazing deal.  . Optional Steel front drive shafts for x. Steel Rear drive shafts for wd Steel rear shafts for wd  MIP drive shafts are much better but the ones I linked seem to be halfway decent and cost about  less than the MIP shafts.  The stock plastic shafts are just a nice way for Traxxas to sell replacement parts and people keep buying them since they inexpensive.  . Dont jump your new RC on purpose until you know how to control your RC in the air.

5495084,0,t3_3qc27p,gt mAh .V cell NiMH battery with AC chargerFrom the store description so thats what you have I assume.Nimh batteries are pretty versatile basically they charge by having a voltage difference from the charger so your charger gives the dead batterywhich say has a voltage of .v electricity at v and the battery uses that difference to jump back up to its full charge in this case .v.  The rate at which your battery charges is dependant on amperage output of your charger.If you look somewhere on your charger it will say something like Output ma or .A  vor so doesnt matter.  To determine how long it takes to charge your battery from totally dead divide its capacity mah by the amperage output of the charger in this case it would take a  hour charge. mahmahoursIn general for the stuff that came out of your box your charger  will stop charging when it detects its no longer raising the battery voltage to .v full.To test your battery voltage which is the best way to gauge the capacity use a multimeter if you have one.,rccars,cwe1ryi,3,t5_2stj0

If you run like I do the stock truck will last about  min each run until youve broken then upgraded nearly the whole car. I have a traxxas rustler that has nothing left on it built by traxxas except the radio receiver. I dont own any of the three youre looking at but I do own other axial cars so if you make it the XL version the yeti would be my choice.  I have no experience with EXC and if I were looking at another traxxas car I wouldnt waist my time actually buying anything from traxxas. Just go strait to RPM or which ever company you choose and buy the parts to build a custom Revo.   is where I got my Rustler parts There is a lot of build time before you get to run but I like that aspect of the hobby as well so it doesnt bother me. It may seem like its more expensive but for me Im just going straight for the car I will end up with anyway and saving myself the initial  I would spend on the stock parts that all broke right away.Ive seen some pretty good videosreviews on youtube of the Rival I would have to take a better look at it to make a decision though.

6649612,0,t3_46pyyo,Im going to expand a bit on what uJayRich said.The Rustler VXL has whats known as a sensorless brushless system. This means that the speed control has no idea what position the motor is in and has to estimate it. As a result this creates some rather abrupt throttle changes. In some cases this can actually mean the car goes in reverse when you want it to go forward.A crawler is not an accurate comparison because those normally use highturn like T brushed motors that have a lot of torque.If you want high performance AND accurate throttle input youll want to upgrade to a sensored brushless system.,rccars,d074llq,5,t5_2stj0

Also the body would get crushed real quick if he got at it before I called him off it.I now have a truck set up just for him but that kit runs a pretty high price tag he has not broken it yet about  years on.

8794251,0,t3_50kr8w,Ive used the picketsaka Louise hummer and they work great on paved surfaces and packed dirt. Ive only run them a limited amount on grass and they were not that good and they were downright terrible on loose dirt. Dont get me wrong I do like the pickets but they are going to be more limited as to what surfaces they perform well on. They do make a great front tire for the rustler on most any surface though. I actually really like how they performed at the local track. Thought have switched to dirt hogs or bow ties in the front and I like either of those better.  Here are some super cheap dirt hawgsAlternatively here are some super cheap . badlands.   these will actually be cheaper than the dirt hawgs as they will use the cheaper . wheels. They will work great in grass as well. On pavement though they will wear fast. Edit here is a picture of the badlands on my rustler  And the masher option. It will work well on grass and give you a bit better wear on pavement. I just ordered a set of these as I could not pass up the price.  Or how about some pre mounted gladiators. The top layer will wear a little quick on pavement but they have a long lasting bottom layer that will still provide great traction in grass. Btw I highly recommend ditching the stubby front arms on the rustler and getting the rpm wide front arms or proline protrac front arms. Youll gain performance and be able to run the same offset wheels all the way around so that you can rotate tires for longer life. ,rccars,d74y7hz,2,t5_2stj0

8847991,0,t1_d7b6d3s,Yea sadly these days that could describe most tracks. I dont want to harp on the past but when I raced as a kid most tracks did a good job of policing and kindly reminding people that this is a family hobby. Now a lot of tracks are lazy they dont police the hack driving dont do tech inspection and they dont seem to care when people in the pits and on the stand people make rude sexual jokes use foul language fight and smoke. This is a young peoples hobby and as adults we should be thankful guests. Sadly what youll see is the bar room tracks will scare the younger and newer hobbyists away and overall do nothing to grow the hobby. The same thing happened a lot in the late s with indoor carpet tracks. I quit taking my boy to one indoor track already after two adults got into a physicalverbal confrontation on the drivers stand during a practice night. The track owner watched from his pit table with a lit drag did nothing and then had a fit on facebook when half a dozen people showed up the next week. Whatever  my money is green and will spend just fine at other tracksshops.Thankfully not every venue in like that. The track featured here seems nice and sometimes people just get caught in the moment and forget. If it becomes a consistant problem a kind reminder never hurts. If someone gets offended and threatens to never come back good we dont need those people anyway. ,rccars,d7beidq,2,t5_2stj0

9217547,0,t1_d8k8rhm,I watch Bathurst every year but this year felt a little boring. Maybe because I wasnt there maybe because of the excruciating amount of ads that we had to watch but I didnt get into it like normal. Honestly I think Bathurst needs  or more cars to be truly awesome and honestly they should allow the top  dev cars to run in the main game for Bathurst. But anyway..I have a soft spot for BJR and it really hurts to see them bomb out like that. Same for DJR theyre  teams that always seem to get the shitty end of the stick. I said early on in the weekend I hoped Scotty Mac would win and if it wasnt for Whincunts move who knows what would have happened but he ruined  peoples Bathurst with one attempted dog pass. He showed his car was blisteringly fast why would you risk your own Bathurst with a stupid move like that when you basically could pick any spot to pass and make it stick!! A podium of Holdens honestly hurts for me to see. As a Ford fan you honestly go to a race weekend not expecting to win or dominate and with ottomh  Fords to  Holdens simple maths says its not going to happen. But congrats to Wilbur. He raced a smart clean race and was there st the end. ,rccars,d8ke4e1,1,t5_2stj0

10137339,0,t1_dbsl5av,I dont have a  but I can give you some tips based on my experience with HobbyKing and cars in general I believe unemesislama has one and can give you some better ideas.HK tends to stock car at all of their warehouses but parts are mostly only available at the global warehouse in Hong Kong. The only thing that affects is shipping costs the global warehouse is usually a few dollars more but not outrageous unless you order something really heavy. HK also has issues from time to time with parts being out of stock for longer than expected. Theres a lot of butthurt about this but the key is just to get what you need and think youll need in a lump when theyre available. Just based on what I normally get Id try and pick up a set of spare front and rear arms hinge pins for the front and rear arms a spur gear or two the optional spring set and a few wheel sets. Outside of the spares I think youre on the right track for a full setup. Theres a wide latitude of things like radios and power systems that you can use. I just give an example of what Im currently using for my BZ.Radio Turnigy XS. Around  and Im pretty happy with it.ESC Turnigy Sportsman A ESCMotor Turnigy Trackstar .. Dont feel like you have to go ballistic speed right off the bat. HK has this car in a ARR almost ready to run version with a . motor. Batteries NanoTech  super shorties I love these little things. Theres a variation saddle pack for cars like the . To charge them I use a SKYRC imax B mini and a v power supply. I love this little charger and for a few bucks more theres a ACDC version if you dont have a power supply. Have fun with it whatever route you go and dont forget to come back and post some pics.

You can find even smaller  scale tires if you are building a tractor trailer for instance. I was going off the measurements you gave us of mm. I can only speak from what I know  and since I dont do any on road builds thats the reason I said maybe it would point you in the right direction.Another thing to keep in mind with a smaller tire like that with the setup I mentioned above would be faster.

10776388,0,t3_5u2kxy,The Arrma Kraton is a strong durable and fast truck. As far as it being the fastest and best basher is a subject of opinion. I had the little brother of the Kraton Talion. The diifernce are pretty much that the Kraton has bigger tires longer arms and a diffrent body pretty much. I put that truck threw hell and back and survived things I never thought any rc could... I hit a tree mid air... As far as your comment about the Kraton having a cage... IMO it doesnt offer much other than protecting the body from caving in when you land upside down. It wont offer much protection to anything else unless you run it with the body off... The cage to me is not really a selling point. You can ask any racer or basher here and they will all attest to the strength of lexan bodys. Lexan bodys are cheap and can be had for less than  usd. Options.... Well you got a fuck ton from kits to RTR trucks. Again this will be a subject of opinion. With that said I will ALWAYS recommend a KIT over a RTR.  Cry Once Buy It Once  . A kit will give you the chance of learning how to assemble you rc from the ground up. This will teach you off the bat how to fix your rc when it breaks and it will break. Kits offer better quality parts and in some cases hop up factory parts. Kit parts have better and stronger parts. For example the Team Durango shock shaft is a mm vs the Arrma being a .mm. Another great part of building the kit is picking your electronics for higher end items that you would likely end up swaping out from a RTR. You will get to pick a way better radio and reciver that will feel better in hand and offer more options from cheap to high end. Stock servo on ANY RTR suck plain and simple and you will just end up swapping that out within the first week.Kits in no particular order and with the kraton being nothing more than a truggy with bigger wheels imo... these will cost in total around  to k completed and driving depending on what electronics you go withTLR ight T e . . TLR is a great brand and makes high end race prove trucks. If it can survive A Main races it is sutibale for bashing. This is a Truggy. Throw bigger tires and wheel combo on it to make it more sutibale. Team Associated RCTE  Team Associated has been in the game for so long now. Race proven with numerous victorys all over the world. Quality is top notch and after market support is very strong.Another Truggy again but throw on bigger wheels tire combo and youre set. Tekno MT  Tekno is a race only company with their first step into the basher scene with a kit car. Quality is bar none one of the best in the market today. This is a monster truck with th race buggy truggy scale in its dna. RTR options. in no order. Traxxas X Maxx s . This is bigger than the Kraton faster and more expensive. Traxxas ERevo . Good solid truck with a parts available at any LHS. Team Associated Rival  A rtr from AE. Strong and takes a beating. You also get good AE quality from a race brand with great electronics from Reedy.Losi LST XXLE  A RTR from Losi. Great parts support and great quality. Comes with dynamite electronics and Spectrum radio not to shabby for OEM  So that is a general list based on what i read on forums reviews and things I have had. In no way shape or form is this the guide to follow but hopefully you will get something out of this. ,rccars,ddri938,2,t5_2stj0
