I like having that varied but really turning it up for the finisher so that the comp has a chance to reverse my finish. I also lower the window big time for the player getting to reverse so that I have less of a chance to time reversals and actually get hit with the cpus offense. AI leave the finish reversal window higher though so I can reverse the cpu finisher. I up the amount of stamina used so that my guy actually gets tired.Do all this at Legend difficulty of course and I think youll have a better experience. ,WWEGames,cmrm17t,3,t5_2t9bx

4436702,0,t3_3bpbva,Not a bad match at all a few missteps here and there but that can all be forgiven considering the online can be really sloppy at times connection wise K really need to fix up their servers. My one real problem with the match came at around the  mark where Cena hit Reigns with an AA and then Punk kipped up as part of his comeback sequence and he couldve went for the pin on Reigns wouldve made sense psychology wise to steal the win that way but instead went for a pin on Cena? Im looking into this way too much I know but it was the one moment that strikes me as odd. But anyway with all that said I feel like I should state how much I love Triple Threat matches in this game. If you get the dynamic right between the three superstars then you can have some incredible matches. I remember doing multiple Triple Threat matches with the same combination of Batista vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Rey Mysterio and I always got a great match with some really creative finishes too.,WWEGames,cspxjnp,2,t5_2t9bx

This year my friend and I are doing our Universe like so...There will be three brands Raw Smackdown and NXT.  One of us will be the GM of Raw the other Smackdown and both overseeing NXTs daytoday.  With all three being major shows there will be three minor shows to make use of the deep roster were inheriting and downloading.Using the spreadsheet well be able to track winloss records well be tracking Power Ranking and Power Ranking History and well also be able to include a third belt into both Raw and Smackdown.  Making our own Power Rankings and keeping record of each match that happens for that particular roster that is competing for that belt. Effectively were going to have three tiers for Raw and Smackdown.  A top tier WHCWWE Championship a midtier U.S.Intercontinental and a lowtier EuropeanUndecided Championship.  Tag team titles will be unified between shows.We will have quarterly PPVs for NXT.  Each show there will be a competition whether its the end of a tournament or a Battle Royal Elimination Chamber etc. to determine which NXT star gets promoted to a main roster.

As for the RawSmackdown PPVs there will be three or four shared five seperate Our respective MiTB KOTR Manias Rumbles SummerSlams and also two shared at the end of the year in which well have a show versus show lineup.  ,WWEGames,cvsod4t,2,t5_2t9bx
5330685,0,t3_3nuyn1,Last year I just had two huge Smackdown and RAW rosters. This year will probably be the same.For my big PPVs Summerslam Wrestlemania I schedule a Saturday show that week of  matches in the same arena just to extend the card as much as  matches. I also create a King of the Ring PPV winner wins a title match at Summerslam like .I get rid of the Divas title and make all the Divas inactive. Sorry I just need more space for other matches. I select whatever Rivalries I want and the rest are rivalries I have in my head. I play every single match to make sure I get the result I want. I made sure to clean up all the Superstars enemiesallies just to make sure the matches get booked properly on the PPVs.The most Ive gotten out of Universe is   years and I play a lot. Its because I sit and play every match. However Ive also never had Primo become my WWE Champion or Jey Uso be WHC for  years because of this. Last year I made Main Event and Superstars more of a big deal with the occasional title match main event and superstars like Orton and Cena appearing from time to time.With how many superstars well have plus myself throwing all the NXT guys on the main roster from the start Ill need to separate RAW and Smackdown brands like before. However I think Im going to keep one tag title instead of two just so that my PPVs dont fill up with  title matches and one non title.I really wish we could book triple threat fatal four way  man or triple threat tag team feuds. That would save me a lot of space for my PPVs.As far as my booking Im pretty consistent with WWE TV. I keep most tag teams together Cena stays near the top Undertaker randomly appears for a few months at a time and same with HBK whenever we get a modern HBK. I never use legends unless theyve interacted with superstars today like Jericho Edge Booker and Batista.,WWEGames,cvt1zml,1,t5_2t9bx

Think of the rivals as mini bosses that you MUST BEAT.You can force a rivalry with the champ when youre not rank   or close to rank  however all that will happen is youll get a nontitle match with the champ on a regular show and the champ will have unlimited reversals and over powering strength.

6779954,0,t1_d0kkzjt,Where are you getting lost? Ill see if I can help explain it better. In the shortterm maybe this helps more thoroughly.Lets say your CAW is CM Punk and you put all the effort into creating this one CAW and his attire is awesome and you got his moveset perfect and all his stats in your Universe mode all nice and tidy. And you have an entrance for him you worked really hard on. But for PPVs you want him to do something alittle different in his entrance. Maybe you like Tyson Kidd walking backwards on ppvs instead of like Owens just walking straight forward the way you have him for your regular shows. Theres not a way to create an alternate entrance like there are attires. But you dont want to overwrite the entrance you already made and lose all that hard work if youve spent a lot of time customizing the RAW entrance. With this process you dont mess with your first Punk you just make  new CM Punks lets call them PunkEntrance and PunkEntrance These are sort of like making backup characters. You dont need any attires stats or anything for these caws we only need them because they create an entrance slot in the games database. Now you go to Create Entrances and you first select CM Punk and youre going to select Copy to Superstar and then select PunkEntrance. This will copy the entrance youve made for Punk over to PunkEntrance. So if you played the game at this point CM Punk and PunkEntrance would now have the same entrance.  After that go to PunkEntrance and create the entrance you want your main CM Punk character to have for ppvs. Now when you play Universe mode before you get to a ppv you go in to the Entrances screen back in the Creation area select PunkEntrance and Copy to Superstar and copy it to CM Punk. Play the ppv and then you can switch it back using PunkEntrance entrance the same way.  As long as you have the PunkEntrance and PunkEntrance entrances and dont overwrite those once theyre created you will have all your work saved somewhere in the game that you can flip back and forth with.Its a workaround process but at least you can do this.It sucks that I cant save attires the same way so I can green and yellow trim Punk attire but if I want red on my same CAW i have to just edit one of the greenyellow ones. ,WWEGames,d0ksiq9,1,t5_2t9bx
6785464,0,t1_d0lew2j,Yea but even in game he has multiple attires. No matter what attire you choose even if the hat is different it still appears as the blue hat. Its kind of a glitch then.

You can play the matches or if you dont like the matches the game suggests edit them and make your own card and play through it.Then you can make title matches make heelface turns or form tag teams and keep booking and playing Raw until you decide you want to add Smackdown or NXT or a Legends show or ROH or NJPW or Lucha Underground....you can download superstars and there arent many wrestlers or arenas you WONT find if you search the community creations suite.There is no scoring system or ratings or anything so theres no penalty for booking the show however the hell you want.

7461741,0,t3_4haiuk,Ayo Im back but just with a RAW for now.In the beginning of RAW two huge announcements are made one is John Cena is returning to RAW after a small hiatus and another is that a new  Contender will be determined next week via Elimination Chamber! Match  Titus ONeil vs. Jack Swagger w JBLTitus ONeil comes out to address his loss over Daniel Bryan however Jack Swagger and JBL come out and interrupt him insulting him for not being able to put away a goat like Bryan who doesnt deserve to be the face of the USA. This leads to a match where with some interference Jack Swagger gets the win after a Gutwrench Powerbomb. Match  The Ascension vs. RTruth and Mark HenryBoth teams return after a small  week hiatus and make sure to entertain after their disappearance with the match being quite high action and brutal though it is the Ascension that pick up the victory after Viktor pins RTruth following his signature STO. This definitely earns them a shot at the Tag Team championships which will be defended next week after they were questioned about it.Next we have Randy Orton talking with Edge who claims no hard feelings however after pressure from Edge Orton agrees to give him one last title shot as the main event to prove his friendship and to maybe even prove he is better. Match  Daniel Bryan vs. RusevAfter having beat the previous  contender Titus ONeil a few weeks back Rusev felt he earned a shot at Bryan who accepted the challenge. However JBL surprisingly came to ringside and rather help out his fellow American in defeating the Bulgarian Brute he actually distracted IN FAVOR of Rusev. Despite this interference Daniel Bryan and Rusev went back in forth in a fantastic match many nearfalls and highspots making it a blast to watch though ultimately it was a running superkick to the head that dealt Bryan in making Rusev the winner.Now Cena is suppose to come out and cut a promo about his return and his claim to get back the WWE Championship but he is soon interrupted by  men who feel they deserve it more Ryback Seth Rollins and Kevin Owens who were all busting their asses week in week out while Cena was at home and its only with the run in of Chris Jericho and the recently traded Dean Ambrose that halts their attempted beatdown setting up for a man tag match for later in the night.. Match  Sting vs. StardustA nice match to fill the time displaying both superstars greatly as Stardust actually seemed like worthy competition to Sting rather than some jobber. However it was ultimately Sting who picked up the win after  Scorpion Deathdrops.Match  John Cena Dean Ambrose and Chris Jericho vs. Ryback Seth Rollins and Kevin OwensHigh action match with lots of finishers with Cena looking especially good in his return along with the old Ambrose vs. Rollins rivalry seeming to be reborn. However all it took was one PopUp Powerbomb on Cena to earn the heels the win. Match  Randy Ortonc vs. Edge for the WWE ChampionshipThese two gave it their all in this match outclassing their Extreme Rules match a night ago with plenty of drama and closecalls. Randy Orton while not known for his highflying ability was able to pull off a diving elbow drop onto Edge from the toprope onto the outside being spot of the night. And even after  Killswitches and two Spears Edge ultimately could not defeat Orton and fell to a RKO. After the match Edge accepted the handshake though ended up shoving Orton away and walking out afterwards still leaving the status of Rated RKO unknown.Overall a pretty good show kinda sad Titus lost since he is one of my favs but still was fun watching.,WWEGames,d2qcquv,3,t5_2t9bx

7649631,0,t3_4k2qsp,On paper it seems like a good idea but the revenue from microtransactions and DLC on a dated titled will never come close to how much money can be made from a completely new release.Also in my opinion regardless of the profitability I wouldnt want to play the same game for  years. WWE Games make advancements in physics and gameplay as well and those are even more important to me than new content. Regardless of my opinion though WWE wants a new game released every year as they get a percentage of those sales every year. Changing the release schedule to once every two years will half their revenue stream from game sales and that wont look good to their investors. ,WWEGames,d3bpyf5,4,t5_2t9bx
