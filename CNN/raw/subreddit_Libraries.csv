As a librarian I really prefer to be helping the person who has the sort of question that requires human intervention rather than making them stand in line while I check out books. And when were having a hectic day I really appreciate that there are four places people to go to check out books without having to stand in a single customer service line for people arguing about their fines and asking reference questions etc. Ideally we can provide better customer service to the people who want to know about great books to read or have specific reference questions when were not trying to rush through them because someones waiting to check out their  books. I have a ton of human contact every day and I think patrons who are looking for human contact can get some from us at my library. But the patrons who arent looking for human contact have that choice too. But I think the staff have to actually pay attention to whats going on. From the main reference desk I have a good sightline to one of the checkout machines but not the other one  I try to keep an eye on if someones having trouble using the machines or if the machines out of paper which I know not all the staff at my library pay attention to. If youre not a librarian you may not know about this but librarians are actually discouraged in ethical terms from making personal comments about what a patrons checking out. It can make the patron feel like they dont have privacy it can make you feel like Well one day were talking about the new Lois McMaster Bujold novel Im checking out but now I have to come in to check out this book on divorcing your abusive spouse or coping with terminal illness or hemorrhoids and I dont want to be judged...So I say yes to personal relationships! No to using automation as an excuse to reduce staff or deprofessionalize!

Should I just not help and kick him out because I dont agree with him? I think Alan Moores book Lost Girls doesnt really celebrate women as much as I would like.

Should I get rid of the Twilight series because its the worst writing I have seen in ages?No.My issue with your posts in this thread are because YOU have inserted your own opinion into this issue.

Mrs. Tobey the chief clerk showed me what I have to do every morning at that hour.First I must take the books weve received that need to go to other branch libraries as well as to Grand Army Plaza and put them in boxes take them on the trucks carts put them in the lift a dumb waiter and then go to the conveyer belt where the man from the Interchange truck a real truck is and send him the books.He then sends me our branchs books and I take them upstairs and screen them for reserved or lost books take out transaction cards from the back pockets and then put the books back on the shelves.Mrs. Higgins in charge of the parttimers and my immediate supervisor has me in charge of  in NonFiction thats a kind of mezzanine above the first floor. So I sort out books and shelve them in their proper places.The first day went fast and in learning the routines I did not feel like too much of an idiot so this job may be okay for a while. Everyone is very kind although I have not yet met the head of the branch whos supposed to be a monster.,Libraries,cr5fdcd,1,t5_2qidr

If you have no financial concerns Id definitely suggest trying a pageclerkassistant job in a library. Id actually suggest that before you start a program  or at least job shadowing someone. Not just someone a few someones as every library is different. How bad the job prospects are really depend on where you are. I had a friend who got the degree in a small city in Michigan.. there are literally maybe a dozen librarian jobs in the whole city. I was in west Michigan and found it abysmal but once I started looking in Chicago while finishing up my degree I found tons of options available. Of course the job market depends on time and place. Right now Ive been looking for a new position and I feel like theres not much at all. But then again Im being much pickier now! Because I did my program online Wayne I had the flexibility to move to Chicago and start a job even before I was graduated. I was looking everywhere possible for jobs  all the usual suspects INALJ going directly to businesses I was interested in etc. Eventually LinkedIn showed me a job and it ended up being that easy.

I say this because there are lots of specializations under the umbrella of librarian and if you know just what youre aiming for your decisions about your bachelors degree and other classes you take will get a lot easier. This might also tell you if a paraprofessional position in the library is what youre looking for. Getting an MLS is expensive and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who isnt looking at specific job descriptions that require it. In my experience libraries seem pretty monolithic from the outside but from the inside the work is much more specialized and the sooner you know where you want to fit the better. ,Libraries,cxo1ha9,5,t5_2qidr

I have worked and volunteered in libraries since  got my MLS in  FINALLY got a librarian job in  and then was fired after  months because they knew my SO wasnt going to move to be with me. So now I am where he lives very large metro city in the PNW take a guess have applied to over  jobs since last July am going to my th interview on Wednesday and have no idea what the backup plan is since this just isnt working. The ALA lies as far as I am concerned. They need to limit the number of accredited schools and number graduated each year because there is such a glut in the market. It is ridiculous. I know that Denver has a library school so my best suggestion is to look for jobs in states that dont have one Idaho Montana Wyoming the Dakotas New Mexico...although I definitely dont recommend Albuquerque!!!. I am not above applying for page jobs to get a foot in the door and when I have gotten interviews I was one of  or  of the  that made it past HR and to the branch out of the  ! who applied. But I am so obviously over qualified they dont give me a chance. I cant even put a book on a shelf here even though I did that for  years at the first library I worked at. It is a mess out there and you are far from the only one experiencing it. Now when I see people post on here about wanting to be a librarian I tell them my story so they know the reality of the situation. I think a lot of people ignore me think that these things wont happen to them but it is too likely they will be right in my place  years from now. So now I try to warn anyone who posts on here.

The computer had to be stored in a custommade locking wooden boxcabinet and only opened for use when the nonprofit had a volunteer present to assist patrons... for  hours only on Saturdays.

I left an LSS position right after finishing my degree and have been bouncing around part time jobs librarian and pay the bills the librarian job isnt paying for the last four years and I think theres a huge benefit in the stability of having just one job you can really focus on and make big changes in even if its paraprofessional.,Libraries,d5vrhlv,2,t5_2qidr
8500370,0,t3_4w57oy,The short answer is that yes there is a small chip and antenna in the tag. Most of the time this tag goes on the inside back cover of the book or the back cover of the media case. The tag for the most part adds nothing to book and there will be no dent in the pages. Indeed most of the time the part of the tag exposed to the world is a smooth surface so you wont have to put a sticker over it at all.The chip is activated by the reader unless you get the ones with batteries in it but I dont know of any libraries that do. Theyre much more expensive. Anyway the chip is activated by bringing it in close proximity to the reader. The reader will provide a burst of energy that powers the RFID long enough for it to transmit its information to the reader. The reader will relay that information to the ILS in the same way a barcode scanner might. Your ILS will get the barcode and whatever else it might be configured to pick up. If youre using RFID enabled gates it will also flip a bit on the chip turning the security feature on or off depending on whether or not its going out the door or back on the shelf.Finally anything you put in the way of the chip can block it but it will take a reasonable amount of work to fully cut it off. The readers are strong enough to pick it up through the cover of a book and some readers are strong enough to activate the chips while the books are in bins processing them en masse. The thing thatll really cause a snafu on a selfcheck machine is the book jacket. If the cover is shiny like a foil cover that can block the reader. If the cover is blue that seems to affect it a bit too. And like Nora Roberts Blue Smoke which has a shiny blue cover... that used to never check out on our self checks.,Libraries,d643k6a,7,t5_2qidr

Tell them that the workplace is a professional environment and part of working is learning how to separate business from personal. That being involved with a coworker can be messy but whatever their personal relationship is outside of work they need to leave it at the door and do their jobs. Focus more on the fact that theyre not doing their jobs because theyre hanging out with eachother and are distractedin a way its no different than if theyre chatting all the time to their coworkers or arriving late and leaving early. Theyre getting paid to do a job that theyre not really doing. I like what ujubilantdusk said about giving specific examples. Make your expectations clear that they are not to socialize on the floor during working hoursuse their break time or after hours for that kind of stuff and since they are still on probation I think you can honestly and authoritatively tell them that if this behaviour doesnt stop immediately they may and likely will be dismissed without a good reference.,Libraries,de5kekx,3,t5_2qidr
