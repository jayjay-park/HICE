883009,0,t1_ch45m85,wow somebody is a bit of a bitch. Where in what I said is their any hate for limp bizkit. I am  just not the biggest of fans. If you look back I have actually posted a Limp Bizkit Song to this reddit. I Like Limp Bizkit. Just not as much other bands. So maybe you should remove your tampoon and stop being a one tracked mind bitch and deal with the fact that some people dont like things as much as you.Edit Also dip shit i fucking suggested them! you dumb fuck,numetal,ch4ngex,0,t5_2sgqr

2379927,0,t3_2ml24n,Whole still and will forever rip me apart. that cd is just amazingly depressing and I love every minute of it. ,numetal,cm5v8dr,1,t5_2sgqr
2598068,0,t1_cmxmgra,Hell yeah Im excited! I loved Dark Days to death still my favorite album of theirs. That album on its own was way different from Chamber Music which is way different from their self titled. If they continue on the path that they were on before splitting up I have no doubt their next album is gonna kick ass. Dez said himself that hes never been more excited to be in the studio working on something so there are virtually no negatives about it in my mind.,numetal,cmxpdhd,2,t5_2sgqr
3392282,0,t1_cpexte5,Ive seen both versions used a lot. They use the slot on their youtube channel and facebook page.I know them pretty well. This is my favorite song of theirs ,numetal,cpey3jj,1,t5_2sgqr
3880335,0,t3_34uc3v,This Nonpoint video has a ton of other bands in it. Some notables Jacoby from Papa Roach Chad from Mudvayne Crazy Town Chester from Linkin Park Jonny Santos from Spineshank David Draiman from Disturbed.,numetal,cqylbmz,2,t5_2sgqr

4598778,0,t3_3dyl77,Otep is one of my top  favorite bandssingers so I will just list a few bands that I also enjoy.Sister Sin she toured with them once really good kind of classic metal feel with a kickass female vocalist.One Eyed Doll more obscure but again she toured with them before and they are pretty good.  Kimberly is an absolutely awesome human being to hang around too.The Birthday Massacre more technoysymphonic than metal but they have a few pretty heavy songs.Other than that other female fronted bands that I enjoy that arent too similar are Angelspit though they are no longer female fronted sadly Delain Sirenia Nightwish Leaves Eyes Epica and Xandria.  Those last  are all symphonic metal which some straight metalheads dont seem to like so much so they might not fit the bil if you want a straightOtep feel.  There is also Emilie Autumn who worked with Otep on Ur a Wmn Now but she is very different.  ,numetal,cta9kx2,2,t5_2sgqr

6721424,0,t3_47muny,Metalcore came after numetal. If there was a single song to introduce you to this sound Id say Anodyne Sea by As I Lay Dying. For whole albums check outAs I Lay Dying  Shadows are SecurityAs I Lay Dying  The Powerless RiseAll That Remains  This Darkened HeartAll That Remains  The Fall Of IdealsThe Devil Wears Prada  With Roots Above and Branches BelowHowever if youre looking for modern bands that capture the sound of the numetal era the only  Ive found are Gemini Syndrome and Love and Death.,numetal,d0ejxd7,4,t5_2sgqr

8145626,0,t1_d4vfc6h,Nope. I heard of Calm back when they came through NY in . Eventually learned about these guys and enjoyed their sound. I like digging up old bands ,numetal,d4vqzy8,1,t5_2sgqr

9025009,0,t3_53vqg5,Not a discount travel website I saw Hotwire open for From Autumn to Ashes Dillinger Escape Plan and  Crazy Fists. So yeah it was a pretty stacked lineup. They definitely held their own but even though they gained a new fan the band folded right after their debut The Routine was released in . The posted track is a bside thats actually a favorite of mine. ,numetal,d7wnxmh,1,t5_2sgqr
9484976,0,t3_5ai6ca,I think adding in some oldschoolers is a good idea too so people know whats up.Hedp.e.  Pay Me or Closer maybe. Really fucking good.Dont forget the new Korn album. Rotting In Vain is insane.Deftones may not be that much Nu anymore but if you want add in Phantom Bride. That song is getting heavy radioplay in my country.As for new bands add in Sylar with Assume and Fire From The Gods with Excuse Me. Also Cane Hill. All of them released original and strong albums. Coal Chamber also released an album last year. Its not fitting for what youre going for but they and Korn were the first real Nu bands from my knowledge. edit most of them already added but Fire From The Gods are missing. They have Nu vibe going on like a heavier P.O.D. with a hint of Skindred.,numetal,d9i86g2,1,t5_2sgqr
