7553073,0,t3_3t63o0,CMDR Doc Seven Echo referred here from the miscreants and constantly warring factions over at the EliteOne sub.  Your faction looks inviting.  Do you have an Xbox player base?  I currently am running fuel for the Rats CG.  Once thats over I may head to your system.  I find myself hopping between trading in my T NPC bounty hunting in my Cobra and exploring yet my newly kitted out Asp Explorer is begging to stretch her legs.  I am coming disenfranchised with the warring between the xbox factions looking for some relaxation and meditation.  After the Rats CG I may come over and take a look.Fly steady!  o,EliteGoH,d30qydf,1,t5_3adjr
9124222,0,t3_556ytl,i dont want to sound like a downer in the room ... but why are the GoH in coalition with some clearly criminally intendedexploitative playergroups?i mean i know that sometimes its moreso PvE than versus each other as human players ... but the game is significantly RPG and of the complete opposite of what one can do with ones OWN save games in a game like civilization or tropico ... dont get me wrong i think players working togther is important ... but if the lines of CHOICE of one galaltic power over another  instead of another when some are highly incompatable with some of the others ... to my mind theres too much of a conflict for a player faction that would be upholding Utopian values which are critically anticrimeexploitation ... and yet in the LIST of   in coalition with  on inara i think it was ... i was thinking about joining GoH ... and then i was like ... whoooaaa  no  not if in coalition with them ... them ... them....so am i missing something here?  is that LIST somehow overlisting ?  ndstep  ndlink adding ones not in practical terms organisatinal terms ones really aligned? ... adding friend of friend etc.... where as DIRECT relationships are less than that?  is it automatically generated?.please correct me so.,EliteGoH,d88kziq,1,t5_3adjr
9307704,0,t1_d8voks9,The GoH stacks up incredibly well. Its growth rate is amazing. Their afre factions tha have tried to expand even in to a sinlge station within their home system and have failed after months of trying let alone expand out of the system. This is peraps the closest thing you can get to a chart of active memebership of factions.And its owrth remebering that every conuted towards the GoH inara page has go to the ffort of becoming Allied and not simply just clicked on add me.You guys are doing an amzing job. Cant wait for multi crew!,EliteGoH,d8vthco,1,t5_3adjr
