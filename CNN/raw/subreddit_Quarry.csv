9450047,0,t3_59y0pl,Ummm... can we please talk about how the entire village scene was one continuous shot? It was nine and a half minutes long. With explosions. And airplanes. And insanely good acting. By an entire fucking company. Its like they watched the one from True Detective and thought how can we blow this out of the water? Possibly the most important scene in the whole season and it was one shot. HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS!?EDIT OK OK so only the first . minutes were one take.,Quarry,d9duyy2,18,t5_349os
