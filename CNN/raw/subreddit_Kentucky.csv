9719161,0,t3_5eb90h,Speaking of Lexington only...There are several breweries in close relation to I Country Boy West Sixth Blue Stallion Ethereal Mirror Twin Life Brewpub but there is a little drive into downtown from I...probably  miles max. All except Life are in pretty close proxiimity so you may be able to hit one or more. Perhaps in this order Country Boy Ethereal Blue Stallion and then West Sixth on the way back out of town towards I.All of these are open on Sunday about noon but you should check their websites.All have great beer so again check their websites and if you want to ask specific questions perhaps I can answer them. Ive been to all of them and all of them have a reasonable varieties and are pretty good. Country Boy has some sours on right now that people tell me are good not a big sour fan here.

10318560,0,t3_5nm0jb,What can you do?Heres how the KY legislature works  That post has some great links to help you find your representatives. Call them. Email them Ive seen instances where the email doesnt actually work or get to the rep.  Where you can check your party status if registered change it or register yourselfothers if not already registered to vote   One of the biggest things you can do is to show up to your county meetings each month. That is typically a  hour meeting once per month. People spend more time sitting in traffic during the week mowing their grass or arguing on Reddit.  While Im a Democrat I know that doesnt work for all people. You can still make a difference in your party of choice.  If youre a diehard Republican no matter what? First of all review that no matter what bit. Figure out the top  things you care about and make sure that matches what the GOPs actions reflect. Show up and be counted at your county meeting and let your representatives know what points matter to you and which ones do not.  What does not help is not doing anything. If you are  satisfied and dont stand to take any financial impact are fine with your friends family and neighbors and their families taking financial and educational hits? Good for you. Life is probably pretty swell. Tax wise Jefferson County has a significant amount of taxable incomes an revenues that fund the rest of the states programs. UofL losing accreditation will hurt the entire state financially educationally for quality of care medically. Never mind BBN losing their  rivals  both teams and fan bases are better and stronger because of each other.,Kentucky,dcdny4a,5,t5_2qo41

10683408,0,t1_ddht87s,Got to be brief for time.Never mentioned Sessions. Only addressed what you wrote and why it doesnt apply. But here is a list of things he did as AG in Alabama. He was bad at his job. I dont know if hes racist but he sure doesnt want to help the poor and minorities. In my mind Byrd would be unfit for office and should be unelectable. But he did admit his mistakes and apologized for them repeatedly including in his memoir. Sessions has doubled down lying about his record and praising his decisions saying the judges were wrong. That seems familiar to an attitude his future employer has.The attack was against McConnell for his actions. For his outright refusal to move the country forward. For denying funding for a list of infrastructure in the state of Kentucky that is on an emergency repair list because it would like the administration did something for the recovery. Remember the financial crisis McConnell refused money to the state of Kentucky when it needed it the most. That is treason.But to the original issue. Six or Seven Senators have now read that same letter Warren tried to read last night and McConnell and the Republican leadership have not had the balls to censure them. That takes true leadership which is what I think the original post was trying to make. Ted Cruz called him a liar on the Senate floor he had no balls then. But a loud mouth smart woman tried to read a letter written by a world renowned civil rights leader about his buddy which the facts of are not disputed yep better shut her up. That is not leadership.The attack wasnt personal against him and it wasnt personal against you. If I wouldve written he looks like a turtle and has the reasoning of one too. That would be ad hominem. But this wasnt ad hominem in any sense. But that is the reddit fallback. Anyone that admits he wants the administration to fail which means the country fails is an anarchist. Rooting against the interests of his countryman or the people of his state is treason.Quoting Wikipedia is a good source? Really? But if you can dispute anything in that article I linked go for it. Understand pointing out the name or disposition of the source doesnt mean the article is  inaccurate. In fact the article paints Senator Byrd in a bad light if you read it. Thats is the conservatives best and only move at the moment so I expected you to say that when I sent it. It was what I found quickly but it was accurate. And you cant disprove it.,Kentucky,ddhwv88,3,t5_2qo41

Thanks for the explaining anyways.My argument is that there is no reason to have a title and also a registration where you have to pay every year. I dont believe that is a valid reason for people to pay them. One title where we pay them one time upon transfer is enough. They have record got paid to uphold record the end. Now charging you a recurring fee for that is unnecessary.,Kentucky,dgqtp8a,1,t5_2qo41
