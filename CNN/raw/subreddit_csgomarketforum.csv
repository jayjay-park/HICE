However this has a more significant impact on items that have smaller quantities since there arent as many people to dump items on the market when the price rises a little.Just a couple of days ago I traded a huntsman blue steel FN for a fade FN. That is solely due to the fact its rarer. It used to be cheaper but like the items you mention it rose the last few days.BS and WW are rarer than FT thats the only reason.

6077937,0,t3_3yrlk9,i have  huntsman cases that i bought at  cents or cheaper so definitely liking what im seeing atm . fwiw the demand before this was more like k a day. xmas monies and all that im sure is bearing some impact on the current rise. I also agree with what someone said about investors stalling the price for quite a bit when they were mass getting rid of it.the short term investors probably alot less of those around now. I expect the price to go higher than elvper is predicting in the coming year i think more like usd.I have  weapon case s and its obviously a much less popular case its sitting around .k in stock as i type this so halfish of huntsman the price is basically the same and it does about  th or  th the volume of sales a day. The Huntsman is a very good case it has a reasonable m a gr AK couple decentish usps... and obviously if the huntsman knife is someones thing then u can only get it here currently. although i think it will eventually go up to round  in the year coming. def expect it to slow up early into the new yr for a bit imo. its only gonna take  ppl with stocks like myself or more who want to get rid of them. and with the after xmas new yr and back to school hangover it will definitely halt for a little while.I still regret not buying more at the time because of lazyness in getting more accounts sorted.,csgomarketforum,cygav9f,2,t5_33bf2

8339998,0,t1_d5jbti7,Probably poor wording from me i mean that it will take roughly a year at least for the price of the new knives to fall. Next case is probably either Gamma  or new operation case. But since a case stays at least half a year in rotation thus it is safe to assume that the knive prices will fall for at least a year from now on due to higher and higher supply from lots of case openings.,csgomarketforum,d5k1y7c,1,t5_33bf2

8498784,0,t1_d63okmr,If we assume that McSkillet is right there is still the question which drops we will get. Maybe some of the old collections like Overpass or Cache which were operation drops constantly since  operations will be replaced by something new or old like Mirage in that case those operation skins could keep rising. I dont think Cobblestone will be cancled because of Dlore and its popularity but who knows. And Gods and Monster Chop Shop and Rising sun are too new to be cancled?

8789079,0,t1_d742dyy,I guess thats sort of true. Demand wont be high forever but supply will drop long before that. There are a limited amount of items and cases have stopped dropping. We arent getting any more Awp assiimovs aside from the ones currently in cases. People get vacd with high value skins all the time which lowers the supply further. Most people dont sell out when they stop playing so those items dont go back out into the market,csgomarketforum,d74b5ha,1,t5_33bf2

9850965,0,t3_5gb5e7,Instead of the usual sarcasm lets explain it. People arent going to say buy bullet rains theyre guaranteed to rise because its impossible to know in the current market but more importantly why would they tell a complete stranger and put more of their profit line at risk?Do some research on which skins have strange histories  Mac Cursed for example. Look for skins which have limited supply on OPSkins and the market but have a few at lower than normal pricing. You can risk that it might rise again but its a tricky game to play. Personally I have won on Desert Eagle Hypnotics and P Muertos but lost on Mac Cursed and MP Pandoras Box....You have to understand that to come onto a forum and basically ask Hi I want to make some money. Someone tell me what to do boils down to asking other people to do the work for you AND risk their own bottom line.You could take the long game on cases again if you wish but the market is so stale right now for consumables that its impossible to predict a recovery.,csgomarketforum,darlqh1,7,t5_33bf2

10938518,0,t3_5w4l4l,I have been paying attention to this topic for a few weeks now. Earlier in the week when someone posted about Kotk cases all it did was raise prices up from .ish to .ish over a few hours then out of no where the market got flooded with several hundred cases and prices cooled off. I personally feel the investors posting about this are just trying to hype up the cases so much that less smarter investors will buy blindly then they can cash out when the price gets high enough. This is a csgo market forum the last time I checked and hopefully this post will be deleted as well. I love profit but context matters. ,csgomarketforum,de88ccb,11,t5_33bf2
