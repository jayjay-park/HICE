582705,0,t3_20tbr5,Built by a bunch of exslaves not a European army the near impregnable Citadelle Laferrire is one of the best examples of the art of military engineering from the early th century.This massive stone fortress was constructed on the orders of Henri Christophe a former slave and key leader during the Haitian slave rebellion by up to  workers between  and  as part of a system of fortifications designed to keep the newly independent nation of Haiti safe from French incursions. The Citadel was built several miles inland and atop the  metre  ft Bonnet a LEveque mountain to deter attacks and to provide a lookout into the nearby valleys.Amongst the colossal defensive walls of the fortress the Haitians placed  cannons of varying size. These were obtained from various nations and still bear the crests of th Century monarchs. Also the fortress was outfitted with an elaborate system of water supply and cisterns. It could shelter a garrison of  men or  if necessary. Enormous stockpiles of cannonballs still sit in pyramidal stacks at the base of the fortress walls. Since its construction the fortress has withstood numerous earthquakes though a French attack never came and it was eventually abandoned.

4805125,0,t1_ctzmt2w,not really  Castles are often out of the way today which means that you have to drive there which means that fewer people consider getting married there. Then there is the problem with hotels  for the people who dont  cant drive back  are there enough around. or is the castle itself one   which means you have to renovate it to standard and you have to pay staff and so on. Castles are nice  but they are a huge money sink. ,castles,cu084zp,1,t5_2qrft
