1371068,0,t3_29rlce,I stated this on the first day of the merge and have been justified in my thought by some of the comments posted here that Im not impressed by Mattherson vs.  A whole lot of talk with very little to back it up.  Sure there are a lot of good players and outfits from mattherson but the hype that was built up was nothing.  As far as being respectful I cant comment as I rarely look at the chat box so Ill let other people chime in on that as they have.  Over all though the merge was good and because of the large pop we have now it has forced me to change my strategies and thus become better.  We are the best server and am proud to fight with and against our new Mattherson allies.  Im sure any server smash event we partake in we will probably kick ass in.

I know we capped two bases adjacent to an amp station and got credit for the amp station cap that was not even a target. I know that during training those that miss it will run with other open platoons and get the credit for the caps. I know that we can shift objectives and some idiot in command chat is blaming us for being the pop at a base simply because our name is on it when we are on the other side of the map. Ive been playing for over a year at BR spent much of that leading squads platoons or coaching others in a large outfit with a large array of personalities and skills.

1909160,0,t1_ckj86cg,MW had a very different take on things.  Because this post could be very long MW eventually became my favorite of the franchise Ill keep it brief.First up MW discarded the notion of the critical slot system used in the board game and in every Mechwarrior game up to that point in favor of a hardpoint system.  While I hated this change it eventually served among other things to help distinguish various chassis.  Before there wasnt really much of a difference between any two  ton mechs as they could be outfitted armed and armored identically.  In addition to this certain electronic systems were restricted to particular mechs only some mechs could use jump jets torso twist rates and maximum allowable distance varied and basically each chassis became truly unique.Throughout the game and its expansions the game had problems though.  Basically it was a problem with balance.  To save a lot of time suffice it to say that only a few weapons were actually worth using in MW native ER Large Laser LRM AC AC ER PPC Gauss Rifle Light Gauss Rifle or at least this was the perception at the time.  This resulted in a meta that was fairly boring and was colloquially known as Boating.  The most popular mechs were the laser boats  ER Large Lasers on a Mad Cat  on a Nova Cat the Missile Boats Mad Cat MK II with  LRM s and the Gauss Boats Mad Cat MK II with  regular and  light gauss rifles.  People basically would sit at a few hundred meters and peek over the edge snipe and then drop back inside cover.  The boat philosophy simply didnt allow for higher intensity combat as you required a lengthy cooldown to keep all that heat at bay.  Eventually the expansions gave a bit more variation.  The UAC came around the much maligned heavy gauss the X pulse lasers and a few other odds and ends disrupted the meta a bit but things still generally stabalized around the Pack lots of one type of guns on ideology.I was never one for that kind of nonsense.  I spent hours tinkering in the mechlab and ended up coming up with some very odd designs many of which were highly lauded by the community.  At one time I had  of the top  designs on whatever the community site for the game was Under the name SynTek if memory serves  its been  years so. . .   For example in an age of boating my choice of a mech that only sported two er large lasers was odd when those lasers were backed by  smaller LRM racks ! and  class  autocannons !!.  People laughed because that mech had a terrible alpha strike potential but they ignored that on the hot maps where I exclusively used it the mech could sustain a staggering DPS at longer ranges than the laser boat could even touch.  Or my highlander design that proved Inner Sphere tech really could compete at close range and regularly managed to go  in city fights against mechs theoretically better armed and armored.Im actually playing Planetside in large part because of how bad the only online version of Mechwarrior is right now.  Honestly my favorite parts of a lot of games is tinkering with the systems and trying to build ways to give myself an advantage.,EmeraldPS2,ckj8pfj,1,t5_329k0

2880313,0,t1_cnt8twa,I get you and we dont differ much in outlook.  What Im about is how individuals can mesh.  Its at the core of any group.  I may be long winded but...  Its entirely possible to talk about leadership expectations without making them personal or destructive in anyway to the process of producing a team effort among individuals who havent ever played together or do so on a very infrequent basis.   If youve been a part of joint ops of any sort you know that if it happens at all that eventually the parties get around to deciding how decisions are to be made what general operating procedures are to be and what each group or participant wants out of it.  It sounds very reasonable but isnt with the since everybody has to confront the reality that things arent going to be as they were and were comfortable with.  They are going to have to give up control and power to some degree.  A shake down cruise has to do with finding whats wrong with the mechanics of the ship but most of all its about how crew settles their differences.   Kicking somebody out is one walking off is another  kicking the can down the road qualifies and so does a nondecision like the two teams solution are all ways of settling differences.   Giving all the power to one having equal power and pretending that leadership isnt necessary or just letting things happen and being pissed off all the time and doing what you want regardless are others. The hard part is in getting everybody to air things out and it means confronting emotions without defaulting to deciding by not being a team.  It happens in marriages too usually over money or sex but what its really about is getting used to sharing power.   InMedeasRage is talking about what he thinks should be the guiding principals.  Its possible to point fingers and make things personal.  It doesnt get anywhere.  If things can be aired out without vitriolic and gamesmanship then its going to work at least to a degree.  In the end people can just opt out and life will go on.  Youre willing to engage.  I hope you decide to participate.,EmeraldPS2,cnvhskh,1,t5_329k0

2891843,0,t1_cnwn0am,Zerg is a strategy that uses overwhelming numbers to defeat your opponent. It gets its name from the Starcraft race that uses large amounts of small cheap units that are quickly rebuilt. On offense this strategy is usually looked down upon as it requires you to sit overwhelming numbers on the capture point for the entire timer allowing your opponent to possibly take the population advantage elsewhere. On defense however this is the strongest strategy in the game. An example would be dropping  population on a fight and wiping it in a short time allowing you to move on to attack your opponents territory or redeploy to another defense.Many people dont like zerging because they say they enjoy fair fights. Which basically means they like to sit in a stalemate for  minutes shooting bad players in the face. Your experience in this game will be much better if you ignore what others dont like and focus on what makes you effective. ,EmeraldPS2,cnwt1en,6,t5_329k0

If you successfully defend a base XP should be rewarded perhaps based on how fast you defended. The faster you go back to your faction bar being  filled the more XP you will earn. Thatd probably get people off their asses.If you abandon a fight you get half the XP you wouldve earned had you stuck around and won.

When I used to be in CML the times where I realized I was shit at the game was when I was alone away from my group. I used them as a crutch for my poor play.Only when I started branching out and started soloing a bit did I truly get the feel of the flow of battle I learnedWhere to find cover and when to move especially when there is no squad members to recon for you and only have random people who dont know what spotting is in the base.To pick and choose your battles so you fight for the long run in the battle rather than a brief spark in it. Groups tend to promote suicidal play because respawnrevival options are there to back it up. Learning to solo means less reviving for medics and more shooting and support from them.How to change the tables on people who are equal or better than you are using the resources and terrain to your advantage. Whereas before it used to be just flankingdistracting them with a squadmate.Soloing helps you learn a lot about the game and when you come back into group play you will know how to play greater roles in the squad and the battles in general.,EmeraldPS2,cr6l8ts,3,t5_329k0

4777632,0,t1_ctwqwde,Miller had a lot of drama about the whole selection process  fairness doctorine. drama on miller suprise suprise! It came down to the higher level outfits who wanted to treat it as a competition its called a tournament and the lower level outfits who wanted it to be a fair play event.It splitted our server in half after the Briggs smash proved that we cannot afford to have weak links. low level platoon got crushed and needed help two hours long The high level outfits pulled out of the whole ServerSmash business until Miller changed from its everyone can come and play to a we go in it to win it. My little summaryBecause of all the drama PSB came up with the fairness doctorine here is a thread that shows that we did not support the fairness doctorine fully because it wasis way too vague.I honestly feel that PSB should have made this a competitive event from the beginning. So that everyone would bring their best and the NaCl levels after someone winning would be a lot lower than what we have right now.,EmeraldPS2,ctwrg1x,2,t5_329k0

Its obvious not as effective as a motion spotter but still so effective that I dont see removing motion spotter change the games much.AFAIK there also isnt a cooldown as long you dont miss a spot for like  times in a row to prevent spamming it but Im not exactly up to date with how spotting mechanics work so Im probably wrong in that regards.However the main issue with your argument is that you want an entire class usability pretty much removed because other classes were slightly less effective. I state slightly because last  seasons clearly showed that LA and obvious HA did great with motion spotters in play...Before you answer yes I know both engi and medic are in a similar situation. Where engi is really only limited to be a repair bitch for a potential max and medic being a really risky play under current scoring system.This is indeed a flaw of the system but I dont see why that flaw could be used as an argument to neuter another class.,EmeraldPS2,cv2yfq3,1,t5_329k0

5224282,0,t3_3mjvug,Ok. This is entirely inaccurate. First off I NEVER wanted to go to Bastion. I agreed to go because we would need to coordinate the entire faction to even have a chance of taking it. We didnt take it and it was actually great that we still decided to work together even after the failed attempt. The continued unity even after failure is what won us the alert. Shades worked well with everyone else the entire time.  is nearly always a competent force during alerts now a days. So Im not sure where you are getting that they are obstructionists.nd and RAUG coordinated with the rest of the faction until the end of the alert. Im not sure what you mean. Im also confused about you saying me and Whiteworm agreed. I completely disagree with Whiteworm on a lot and agree with Shades most of the time. Also that girl who you were working with at Bastion is a prepubescent guy who leads AOD. I think it is at least.We were coordinating with nd until the end so Im really confused by your statements. I cant believe you just said AOD is most coordinated with the most competent strategies. Im ded from laughing so hard.The network hub plan that could be construed as a failure from outsiders had  uses. One it forced VS to contest our capture of it hard since it only had one point. They needed a much larger force to repel us. It would have disconnected a ton of VS territory. It also forced VS to give up tech plant to NC. Shades was right to continue down the Sungrey lines. Since VS was in shambles from panicking. Sometimes people attack bases not to take them but to pull forces from elsewhere. I only half expected network hub to work and I said that in command chat. VS had to choose between  bad options if we attacked it. That was the only plan I had that didnt work if your only definition of working is taking a base. I took like  bases along Wokuk lattice links with a little over  pubby squads earlier in the alert. The real positive is that command didnt give up after the failed Bastion attack.Onto the point of the post. Id trust myself Shades Octavian from Dog and CaptainCox from TR on command chat. Especially myself though cause Im Sun Tzus father.Edit Ill be honest since I just read Cox throwing me under the bus. Cox is overly cautious indecisive and gives up on taking a base way too early. Still above average and he leads a fairly competent and active force but he isnt Shoctor. Shoctor apparently is only playing VS now.,EmeraldPS2,cvfpu28,-9,t5_329k0

5366230,0,t1_cvxkr8t,Most of the problems that people find with their factions are usually madeup. TR has midtier outfits. NC has midtier outfits. VS has midtier outfits. The problems that plague outfits and factions as whole entities goes so much deeper than some subjective idea that one faction has more of something than the other factions. The main problem that I see is differences in opinions. Some leaders of some outfits see certain things to be very fun and very effective. At the same time other outfits see the same thing as a waste and look down upon those other outfits. And then it spirals with people becoming even more separated and not able to actually work together as their strengths. Each faction has very capable outfits leaders and players. You just need to look at them in different angles to see their respective effectiveness. Edit Or just merge because that has always worked so well. ,EmeraldPS2,cvxlhpk,2,t5_329k0

5372883,0,t1_cvybvyg,Can I give you one useful suggestion re the joint ops side of things? Consider rolling alts and running joint ops on other factions with a small group of key people e.g. decision makers or people who you feel would be good resources to bring along to get a feel for how they view other outfits and how they viewaddress the VS on this server. I guess this isnt technically joint ops so maybe its better to say bring a small group and join NCTR outfits when they do their ops.Bonus points if you can do this on a night where you know SSGO is going to be active so you can fight against your own outfit and their leaders and get a read from an enemys PoV and double bonus points if its during an alert since people tend to step up their game re intensitymobility. Youll also get a less filteredmore realtime readreact to how people perceive your outfit when they show up at a baseon a lane.Edit This is of course not something that is super useful if youre basically going to be a pure zergfitfeederfit but if you want to try and move closer to the midtier I think this sort of thing can be useful.,EmeraldPS2,cvyg2t1,3,t5_329k0

5458364,0,t3_3poah4,When I run with a large platoon I personally try to designate someone to pull a galaxy or sunderer ahead of time or multiple depending on the situation and distance and have those ready to go while leaving the main force there as suppression. Rededployside is still real so I dont like losing a cap at the last second by pulling everyone off when they can redeploy into a galaxy right after. As long as its still in friendly territory they can still get to the next fight quickly and if poop hits the fan where theyre at they are already suppressing the counter attack. I also want people to have fun and lead casually in a sense so I dont make vehicles or maxes redeploy when I lead or kick people that might be intelligent enough to do things that are needed on their own.  I try to have people get to fights where they dont get farmed but arent sitting around bored out of their minds. Tactically during an alert I play differently and defensively. Theres a much more constant flow of movement from spot to spot in that scenario. I dont PL much anymore so Im speaking mostly as a squad leader or two squad perspective. In those cases I just ask the PL for permission to sort of rogue my squad as I see fit and they usually say thats fine. If they dont its not the kind of platoon I want to be in. Sometimes we just follow the zerg and play for funfarm and sometimes I have them move fast and do what the zerg cant so I try to be on point and have them ready to respawn when I feel its ok and more of a shock troop attack.,EmeraldPS2,cw9cvz1,1,t5_329k0

5480785,0,t3_3q5i1w,gt they were moving in airarmor in amounts that effective resistance would be impossibleFrom my experience as the squad lead of IOWN on the western lane this is spot on. Our squad of six was tasked with the vehicle play on our lane a job we had great difficultly doing. I recall us pulling AA buses multiple times and getting wrecked by  AP lightnings. When we pulled lightnings of our own they always have an equal or greater number of them.I remember one time when we had three lightnings and an AA bus up and we had just wiped their sundies from Genudine I saw two battle buses at least  lightnings and a vanguard coming straight from Sharpes. We proceeded to get wrecked. We had one success where we pushed up to Sharpes with a bus and some lightnings. Though as we were attracting more enemy pop to resecure they pulled more lightnings and wiped us through numbers. Im not sure if they had more dedicated vehicle players on the Western Lane or we just didnt coordinate properly as a squad. Performance wise we did just as well as FedX as shown by kills and KD unfortunately at the very bottom for  man outfits.

I do make suggestions but I feel that you would discard them on some fabricated technicality.Your problem is you are trying to ram home a solution without considering the constraints of the problems it may create. This is a recipe for more work down the road. Should you need evidence look at the leaning tower of Pisa.  How many millions have been spent trying to correct something that was built on an unstable foundation?  closer to home how much programmer time and effort has been wasted because they shoved the game out the door in  months instead of developing it properly?The same holds true here. I have always tried to understand the goal of the devs and align my suggestions with those goals. Suggesting that they undo something they did will almost always get you nowhere. To take your competing suggestion to VP You are suggesting a WDS style capture system and MMO like cosmetic gearing. Have you considered the costs of having bill and bishop make that gear? By not charging for it that is now a financial loss not counting the cosmetics people wont buy because they have this gear.  Tell me have you thought ahead to when most players have all their cosmetic gear? What then? Do they make more? Add a new tier? That sort of thinking might work in expansion based MMORPGS but I highly doubt it will work here. Not to mention it does nothing to address the fact that armor and air have little purpose outside farming. Your suggestion does nothing to address this. The VP generator could serve as a new objective for those vehicle players allowing them a role they have been lacking since day one. Again your suggestions have amounted to NO! NO! BAD!  And dont address the problem that vehicles have no purpose.

5834796,0,t1_cxkfw3b,I get those moments too.Right now Im trying to finish my last VS assault rifle the Equinox VE.  With a compgrip its actually amazingly accurate.  To the point that within m I can chain headshots and kill HAs.  The problem is if I am not shooting perfectly I get killed by those same HAs.  It shines in those fights where you are fighting outdoors but not getting shelled by armor.  I flanked a HA at m last night and he popped shield turned around and killed me with a GDs.  I was very annoyed because even against the shield I felt I should have been able to kill him.  If I had thought otherwise I wouldnt have engaged.  But I realized not only did he have the shield he had a more appropriate weapon at m and might have been using NW while I play medic using flak most of the time.  There were just too many things in his favor that I didnt factor in.So while I am with you on constantly improving and critiquing mistakes I also know theres a lot more to it than raw shooting or positioning.  Im constantly dying to BRs who get a few lucky headshots even though they have a sub  KDR.  And that damn no attachment trac...Also make a few backups of your .ini.

6141343,0,t3_3znjlq,So tonight I was leading GOKU and I have to say... it was tough finding good fights.We started on Esamir where as you can see in the screenshot we had a cushy   pop and lots of territory.  After farming the TR at a biolab I decided to take us to Amerish hoping we could make some headway out of the warpgate.Frustratingly the TR were aggressively camping the warpgate.  We had some fun taking barrik electrical back and forth a few times same with Aramax chemical.  But then we were faced with AFC or Granite valley against double the continent pop.  I made a few plays for AFC which we couldnt push through.  The NC were completely ignoring us so it was either ghost cap or get farmed.  The Esamir alert popped and I grudgingly took us over there despite having lots of pop.We had a pretty easy alert running into BAX twice for good fights and keeping the TR completely pinned at Andavari.  We ended the alert owning almost  of the territory including Nott and Eisa locking the continent.  I was disappointed we couldnt get better fights but despite only  continents being open we couldnt really even the odds anywhere.I took us back to Amerish hoping to avoid Indar.  We made another attempt to get out of the warpgate which had been recaptured entirely.  Hit another brick wall at AFC and now the NC were hovering at  pop and completely stonewalled Wokuk with .  Indar was shit as usual.  I got us to cap Aramax and Barrik again we defensive farmed Wokuk tower and then I called it a night.   hours of PLing without the ability to really get something going on Amerish and just zerging Esamir.Frustrating.  ,EmeraldPS2,cynpfyx,4,t5_329k0

6380488,0,t1_czeed7d,I canhavedo play every single other infantry class in the game and I play them all well based on my ability to play FPS fairly well in general. You make the point that Planetside  is not a pure infantry game by design when almost everything about the games combat screams the opposite. Vehicles feel shoe horned into the game an afterthought if you will. Weve actually got a REALLY GOOD infantry game minus a few blemishes here and there but if you are actually trying to be successful against the way everyone in the community plays the game youre going to find  yourself being unable to necessarily DO the fun things you like to do simply because this game has a problem with shittier players who will literally dopull anything to win a meaningless base.Bad game design and ignored bad game play mechanics ALLOW every fight that you spawn into to be completely inundated by mouth breathers that will literally do anything to get one kill and then die. The next average to decent sized fight youre at take note of when you see a heavy that cant really beat you with his gun pull out his rocket launcher instead to insta kill you. Take note of all the vehicles parked at the drive in movie theater that is the outside of your spawn room or the insta gib bulldogfury vehicle that is parked right onnext to the control point. Take note of the ESF AG farmer who when challenged by any other aircraft succumbs because he can literally only right click left click ground targets and then die. Take note of how many regular players you kill who immediately rage pull a shotgun that almost completely removes all skill barriers. Take note of the guy you kill twice who now decides that he needs a  HP insta gib suit with built in teleport because hes mad you  dinged him a couple times. You really still have the nerve to ask me why I play a class with more available HP in a game with unmitigated garbage game mechanics that any mouth breather can employ at literally any given time?

6625164,1,t1_d04j0m2,Heres the context that this whole incident took place in.VS own Saerro.  The TR foolishly in my opinion tried attacking it because attacking Saerro is almost never a good idea.  They held C point intermittently got on B and were getting ruthlessly farmed in the tower.  The VS let the fight drag out for well over an hour farming the tower touching B while these TR pubs kept dying the map didnt really have many other great options except going to biolabs  this is Esamir after all.So Bloodryne did the one thing at Saerro that an attacker can do that doesnt involve being fish food for the VS who have been padding their KDRs at that base.  He put an HE prowler in the mountains between Saerro and Eisa and started farming the tower.  He was one of the only TR actually getting kills and not dying over and over.  AND he was doing one of the only things that actually give his faction a chance to break into that tower and potentially win the fight.I made a post on the main sub about how problematic these bases are and how they would be improved by shortening the timers.  It was just an idea and some people liked it others didnt.  Unsurprisingly a few people didnt like it because they thought I was trying to kill good fights.  In other words such a change would interrupt their tower farming forcing defenders to leave the tower and hold  points or lose their base a lot faster.So the argument that hazey was acting on behalf of the collective group of VS in that fight rings very hollow to me  after all they are holding a highly defensible base and have just about every advantage possible including the presence of other highly skilled players who are doing what they do best.  If anything bloodryne was taking a shitty situation and a shitty base and turning it back on its head by using his HE prowler.  I hadnt really gotten into the moral question of this whole thing because I thought it was pretty obvious that instead of taking one of the many routes to kill a single HE prowler faction swapping to TK was the wrong one to take.  Like I said in the original thread you can pull a VS lib and probably get the same result.  Or bail assault with C.  Or if you are really getting farmed there find a different angle of attack or place to spawn.But if you want to get into morals Hazey was acting selfishly against the terms of service of the game and against the intended design of the game.  He was right that he should have killed that prowler  as you said the needs of the many.  But he did it the absolutely wrong way.  I cant believe I actually need to explain that to anyone.I havent taken a debate class or a philosophy class in years and am long removed from college so I cant really engage you in terms of justified partiality.  So perhaps this response falls short in that regard.  But in a video game where there are many complex interactions with different players  there are countless scenarios where players are put in unfair environments.  I also have a growing list of things that I think need to be rebalanced from EMPs and motion spotters to base designs and maxes and the entire air game.  But I accept the game for what it is and dont pretend that we can somehow teamkill our way to better fights or a better game.  As far as what people think of you?  I actually think you are a pretty fair and seemingly nice person.  Weve had plenty of good interactions over the months and years.  What I am saying is that your statements are unbecoming of a moderator.  As in something that a community moderator shouldnt be saying.  Thats a judgement on your actions not your person.

The only people who are bothered by me are those who play in a fashion to ruin the experience for others who play this game. At the end of the day this is a game. This isnt a set match with rules. Its a sandbox. Where players make the experience not the game. Eve online has a similar experience as this one. It even has its own toxic community. But it has enough places for new players to go that there is at least some shielding from the elitist player base. That doesnt exist in this game.This game is dying. Every month is generally worse than the previous month. No one sees or for that matters cares that their actions have a direct result on people playing this game. I dont comment on infantry stuff as I dont participate it in that much.Yes. I send tells to people who actively try to make this game worse. And to be clear only the elitist jerks have problems with me. Its funny how I get along and do just fine on live. I have conversations day in and day out with people both above and below my skill level in the air. We get along just fine. So I will keep on sending tells to those of you who sit on flight ceiling if you are actually good and have no reason to do so. Those of you who use aa missiles. Those of you who gank the same person over and over.I dont appeal to the elitist jerks. They dont like me. I fight for the every man. The people who are trying to get to the next level in their game.

Same with running with a pistol out etc. None of this was as prevalent before stats.da added medkit prominently.Either way objectively speaking killing a BR repeatedly like that pads KDR accuracy HSR if you choose to KPH directives not with a Betelgeuse obviously but otherwise LPK and SPK.

Its like they went and bought a new engine for a ship that has  holes in it. Sure its a nice new engine but it didnt really do anything to make the boat more seaworthy.

Were infantrycentric just without MLGtier players.gt The day I see a successful TR underpop cap maybe Ill change my opinion.Well whenever we happen to be in the same place you carry the overpop to victory so thats a little tricky.

He isnt worth responding to.It isnt a perfect response since Keirsti probably knows something about the game but dont waste your time on tr.

So I started to drive towards him honking the whole way  not a single flinch but starts to shoot at me with his pistol when I got really close. Thinking to myself This must be a noob. I jump out of the sundee and begin to knife the air to start a knife fight. He doesnt follow through and continues with his pistol  all misses. I start charging him with my knife and he finally gets a hit on me. I raged a little bit since he wouldnt join in my knife fight I switched to my primary and domed him.I still regret pulling the trigger to this day. It was a flippin fresh BR nub.

The massive hellzerg then pushed its way north and capped towards the biolab and East and capped j. The giant obnoxious air blob pushed the VS back to crater firing range. The fights were all shit so we grabbed a ranger harasser with a buster Mac in the back and trolled the air until we got bored and went to Saltamir.Basically the only thing that can break the stale front lines is a massive cancerous Hell zerg which is also tremendously unfun. bringbackhex,EmeraldPS2,daruqut,1,t5_329k0

10882256,0,t1_de1yxqw,gt i dont think your providing me as much insight as you think you areThat maybe and Default running IRGU was about as Tryhard an outfit as they come. But then what do you expect from a SoloValk pilot main? P  Yet more is said in team speak than anything you may have experienced in chat in game. For instance one of the biggest frustrations we all expressed and Default is definitely verbal in TS about Zergfits is the lost potential they represent. If you are questioning him or the zergfit vs nichefits  like IGRU at all you might have missed that his frustrations would only be so hot because he sees that much potential being wasted. In an odd way that is quite a complement. And if you knew Default at all thats about as close to a real complement as you will get! P,EmeraldPS2,de2fe8f,1,t5_329k0
