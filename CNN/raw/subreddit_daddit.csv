9250,0,t1_cef3i93,Well first its not a preference its a hard wired result of genetics. I dislike that term as it insinuates there is a choice. Second youre right. kids are unaware of sexual urges or societys correlation to colors. He maybe gay and like the color pink. He may also be strait and just like the way that red and white mix together to create a bright and vibrant color. He may just think they are silly and he likes the attention hes getting from wearing those glasses probably the case.When I was about  I think I painted a ceramic heart for my mom for valentines day. I was super proud of it and carried it all day. We went to a store and I got tired of carrying it. It had a ribbon tired to it do you could hang it. I ended up hanging it from my elbow. My mom noticed the funny looks I was getting but ignored them. I must have looked like a little old lady with her purse clutched tightly to her side.  years later I got three kids and am as about as hetero as you can get. I got guns collect knives and chew beef jerky blah blah blah. Doesnt change the fact that when I was a kid I enjoyed a fairly girly object and didnt care what other people thought. Just my thoughts sorry for rambling haha.,daddit,cefhlqj,1,t5_2rxue

Im only at  weeks so Im as interested as anyone else here on how to do this.One of the books many people around me swear by is Healthy Sleep Habits Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth.  Unfortunately the book meanders a lot and the advice contradicts itself.  Basically the solution is to try everything even the counterintuitive stuff and then when you succeed claim that youre smart.One of the many things he recommends that you didnt mention directly was to put her to bed earlier maybe  or  hours.  Look for signs that shes tired  yawning or fussiness that seems to indicate that shes struggling to stay awake.  Do your best to put her to bed right at that time.  In some cases putting the kid to bed earlier results in the kid sleeping longer.,daddit,cejx1ms,3,t5_2rxue

I could use FMLA sure but it would come at the expense of my wifes time.   When you work at the same company as your spouse you pool from the same FMLA allotment as your spouse you dont have your own individual time.Luckily my company still had a paid one week paternity leave.  I still needed to use up a lot of my vacation time because my wife had a csection.   I mean honestly that is a pretty major abdominal surgery.

231854,0,t3_1wqoh2,My story for todayMy clothes washer has been making an awful smell when the water would drain out. It is a front loader and awhile back I had checked the trap to discover my daughters socks and others things clogging it up. It made it very slow to drain. So I figured that the trap was causing the smell. Well my girl . wanted to help. So of course I let her. I showed her how to use a drill to remove the screws how to open the trap and let the water drain and how to clean the trap. Then we put it all back together. Washer smells better and my girl learned how to do it yourself. Being a dad rocks. ,daddit,cf4s38g,5,t5_2rxue

Try to assure them that theyre not alone in this and that many people have been there ours are  months old just a couple days ago and come out on the other side great.

I found out when I was  that my LDLs were in the mids after a routine physical and simple blood test.  I was put on a fairly low dose of simvastatin  mgday and my total cholesterol is now well below  mgdL.  I now go to my doctor every  months for maintenance blood tests statins do have a chance to mess with your liver so the tests are to ensure that the medicine is still working and that there are no issues with my liver.  The generic medication is  covered by my insurance.  So are both physicals with my doctor.  The only thing I pay is  for the lab tests. per year is a pittance for the peace of mind that Im much less likely to end up like both of my Grandfathers who died of heart attacks in their early s or my cousins who have had heart attacks as early as .TLDR GO GET TESTED.

Youll get to hear your wife complain about all sorts of legitimate things and theres nothing you can do to help. A good FRG goes a long way here. Everyone else hit the nail on the head though. The first few months are rough but it gets better pretty much exponentially once the kid learns to go back to sleep on her own when she wakes up at night and when she really acknowledges you.

I can barely remember what life was like with out him and cannot imagine anything will bring me as much happiness as he does. So many things get said about parenthood that are trite and can barely express the joy but they are true.My wife and I are planning on adopting our second child so weve been through the parental adoption classes and training.  The major theme in all of these classes is that these kids will still wonder about their birth parents and that you as the adoptive parent must always keep it in mind as the kid will.  So do the kid a favor and make it so he only has to wonder about one parent. Also kids and babies are amazing wingmen should you ever get to a point where youd like to meet women again.,daddit,cflulg9,2,t5_2rxue

671675,0,t3_21ubni,That happened to me and my wife a lot. In my experience it was generally as simple as misplaced frustration. You are frustrated because you are trying to adjust to a new way of life that is frustrating. Being a new parent if very frustrating. You try to contain your frustration but inevitably it spills out somewhere at some time and brings about an annoying and lame situation between you and your spouse. Its the frustration of adjusting to a new situation in your life. And you cant be mad at the situation so when you get frustrated negativity tends to spill out through your frustration onto your spouse which they dont like so they send the negativity back which you dont like so you send it back and so on and so on. its a cycle. You just gotta not let it get to the point where it all happens out of reaction. Cuz if your reacting your not thinking.How we got through it was by simply sucking it up. When you feel the bickering coming on just leave it be. Acknowledge to yourself and politely to your significant other that you can feel yourself starting to bicker and you would rather stop and walk away for now to cool off or collect yourself or whatever than start an argument with them and leave hurt feelings. Usually when you tell someone that you need to leave in order to spare the feelings of both of you they wont be upset with you for that. Its a pretty selfless thing to leave a situation to cool off so both parties arent pulled through the ringer. Hope my experience helps!,daddit,cggmael,8,t5_2rxue
672899,0,t3_21uner,I havent made it to this phase yet and to be honest Im a little nervous. My  month old is an expert at pressing my buttons already. I just cant believe how many times I say NO! on a daily basis and Im not even there most of the day. However the fact that you are seeking help means that you have not yet lost your mind. The hard part though will be realizing what is happening in the moment and stopping yourself from reacting. This is something I currently struggle with as well. When I get worked up I am very tempted to just lose my mind and scream and yell but I have to stop myself.So I cant give much advice except my mantra Keep trying. Keep trying to be better. Keep trying to help. Keep trying to stay calm. Keep trying to raise the perfect kid. Keep trying to ltanything else you need to tell yourselfgt. Good luck!,daddit,cggrbfc,1,t5_2rxue

The first  days were some of the most stressful of my life. I cried at one point because I was so tired and I was afraid Id fall asleep holding him and Id drop him. I was so tired I wanted to die.But it passed.Its okay if you freak out a little. Freaking out is okay. Its normal. This will pass. Thats your mantra. Say it over and over. This is normal this will pass Im going to get the hang of this everything is going to be fine.I was a champ at this child care stuff by like week . Zero to hero. Youre going to be just fine.EDIT If youre ever too stressed to deal put the baby down in the crib and walk away for just a few minutes. Letting an infant scream for a little bit isnt going to hurt it you getting so stressed you crack and get rough or something IS dangerous. Put the kid down in a safe place crib walk away for two minutes. Breath. Hell punch the crap out of a pillow or something if that makes you feel better. Then you go back and figure out if the kid needs feedingchangingburpingholdingrockingwalking around.Its going to be okay buddy.

My advice to you would be to watch the nurses handle your baby they handle hundreds a year. The first time bathing my son was a little terrifying but now I just shower while holding him. You will relax with time. Good luck and congratulations brother. ,daddit,chi6ytm,1,t5_2rxue

1182603,0,t3_27nukq,Hey friendYou are not alone out there with your frustrations. Some infants are just more challenging than others. Once the honeymoon stage has worn off a bit and the relatives have gone home its just you guys and the baby. Thats when the hardest times can be especially when there are medical complications. Just remember it almost certain to get better. This is just a stage and every day that you survive is one step closet to your child growing up. The best thing you can do is take a step back and ask what is the real problem. You might be yelling with your wife but did she really cause the problem? Once your figure out where the real issue is you can keep taking baby steps towards the solution.  Other things to think about is focusing on your breathing and taking your ego out of the equation. While I dont personally meditate I believe in the Buddhist ideals of trying to keep a clear mind. Might be worth looking into a book about it. Now thats easy to say but when you have a two month old having a meltdown its hard to do that. But its hard for everyone. Just remember all dads feel like they are not going to be good enough but thats very rarely the case. You will make it through even if its not perfect. And hey if you can make it through boot camp youve already dealt with screams and stress. Just take things one day week or minute at a time.,daddit,ci2nuq3,3,t5_2rxue

1210355,0,t3_27z0mm,We went from a one bedroom to a two bedroom apartment when we were expecting our son. We like having a separate room for him. It means our bedroom can remain a child free sanctuary most of the time. Theres a laundry room and a bathroom in between our bedroom and his which means theres even a decent noise buffer for whomever is sleeping. It might take up to a year to find close and move into the right house. Theres no guarantee baby wont be born by the time youre ready to move. If you need to upgrade look for a rental house or bigger apartment for a couple of years. You wont be responsible for maintenance or repairs when your little one needs you the most. Lots of projects will simply be put on hold with a newborn. We moved when my wife was  months pregnant and had just about everything settled arranged and decorated except our bedroom before our son was born.

Surely love has no bounds but Im inclined to think most foster kids would do better with the resources of an economically stable uppermiddleclass household than in a workingclass family that cannot offer the same opportunitiesresources.,daddit,cl9v8fz,1,t5_2rxue

2159250,0,t1_cle87mq,I got my information from a bunch of years as a psych and neuroscience major many peerreviewed articles none written by me or anything and a few anecdotes from friends who experimented way too much with it and were left with the equivalent of a permanent khole. In fact most of the articles regarding positive benefits of mdma and i mean pure because thats what real studies use is mostly focused on trauma not depression.  Even in those studies the treatments were concluded to be unsafe due to the degenerative effect it has on neurons.  MDMA is touted as as cure for depression not by the scientific community but typically by psychonauts who want a platform to rationalize their drug use.  And Im pretty much a utilitarian in regards to most drug use save crack coke and heavy heavy opioids in that do what you want to.  Its your body.  But to try and spread inaccurate information to justify your the royal you not you in particular own use is disgusting on the same level of the over prescription of heavy heavy opioids for less than terminal conditions.  Youre either misleading or mislead in your info regarding mdma as a useful treatment to depression.  And the people youve seen first hand get better might find themselves unable to activate or reuptake their neurotransmitters in the future.  Which will lead to serious serious side effects in addition to a sharp relapse of depression including but not limited to conditions resembling parkinsons.  I mean sure you wont have depression while you do it but otherwise thats some serious poison youre slinging.  Endorphins have a similar affect although lessened on depression are really really unlikely to cause damage to your nerves and theyre free. ,daddit,cleagjj,2,t5_2rxue

Get an ice pack some bandaids antibiotic ointment Benadryl Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen childrens version of all meds.  Find out whose insurance she is covered by.That said  year olds eat a variety of different things.  Chicken nuggets are a good fallback until you figure out what she likes.  Fruit.  She should probably drink whole milk and water with occasional juice.  Beyond that you will probably have to experiment a lot.  You should encourage her to eat what you eat but that can be a huge battle you may not want to fight.Do you have Disney Jr andor Nick Jr?  If so that will be a good emergency fallback plan for keeping her entertained.  Crayons and paper playdoh simple puzzles Duplo are all good choices too.  At  most toys are not that gender specific and kids are not too picky either.  If she does not have a favorite stuffed animal I would take her to the store and let her pick one out.Baths  you just have to get over it.  Get some kids shampoo and washcloths and maybe some bath toys.  Fill the tub only a couple of inches and let her play then scrub her down.  DO NOT LEAVE HER UNATTENDED!!!Potty  this is tough.  Potty training sucks under any circumstances and these are not good ones.

2896298,0,t3_2inm41,I know this post is pretty late but I wanted to give you a bit of encouragement. Small acts of service have a deeper impact than you realize. The one that stuck out to me was the shot of the princess lunchbox. Im sure you two probably had a good laugh about it but that fact that you took the time to pack his lunch means more than he probably now realizes. My father passed away a few years ago way too early into my young adult life. Of the many ways he loved me one thing that stuck with me was the fact that he never failed to pack my lunch before work. I never asked him to and I would have gladly done it myself but he was acting selflessly. That had a huge impact on my life just that simple act of service. Now that hes passed away Ill never forget that love he showed and I intend on caring that service onto my future family and others. Sorry for getting really emotional. But I just wanted to point out that small acts of love will really add up over time. It will be shown back to you in more ways than you could imagine. Maybe not now while hes still young but it will happen eventually. Just wanted to encourage you. You guys seem like a really loving family and he seems like a great big brother. ,daddit,cnxban2,2,t5_2rxue

3308792,0,t3_2y1gk9,Yep. I hardly ever cried before I had my daughter. I would feel emotional about things sometimes like tv shows or books or  whatever but I could reign it in easily and remain stoic looking. Not anymore. Now if theres something remotely sad or sometimes even cute or happy queue the waterworks. Especially if therere kids involved. Its not like I even project my kid into the situation or anything. My tear ducts just activate all on their own. I have to do my labor visualization hack to try to control myself when therere other people around but when Im home with just my family Ill just go ahead and get sniffly. My husband has been more teary too since Baby. He used to get sad and cry about some things when wed watch a movie but hes done it more in the last year and a half. Especially sad kid things for him too now but any sad thing might trigger him. Or happy thing. Sometimes the happy ending rolls around and he starts sniffling. A lot of people I know seem to think its unmanly he cries about movies and things but I love it. I like that he empathizes so strongly with other people even if theyre fictional and it makes me comfortable being emotional around him.Edit Sorry just realized this was rdaddit.

Everyone can buy one of the many straw sizes available mbps  mbps mbps etc. If you buy the larger straw its only normal to expect to drink the volume that fits in the straw. The amount of milkshake is more the data caps which are also applicable. How fast they drink it also doesnt matter. Youre allowed to drink this much per ltperiod of timegt mbps  and are allowed to drink ml data caps. The straw has no effect on either except limiting you to x mbps. The analogy is pretty damn good!

The best suggestion I have is to stay supportive of your wife and to keep letting your boy practice and try to figure it out. Maybe you supplement with milk or milkformula by bottle to ensure hes getting enough to eat. Let your wife know that you will help her do anything possible to make breastfeeding work. Keep trying because it is what she wants and maybe eventually your boy will get a good latch.,daddit,cqzfvr7,5,t5_2rxue

3961286,0,t3_35u5hn,We have flown  times with our MO and it has actually been pretty easy.  Honestly packing up to get out of the house is usually the worst part.  People tend to be extra nice when you have a baby which really helps.  We always took a cab to the airport and brought his car seat.  You can check it for free to your destination.  We also bring an umbrella stroller for actually going through the airport.  Again you can gate check that for free and it doesnt count against your carryons.  Plan for one of you to just carry him through security then put him in a stroller.  They will probably do the hand wipe detection thing and a brief pat down.  Heres some other tips off the top of my head Allow extra time for everything.  It will all take longer with a baby and is so much more unpredictable. Nurse or feed during takeoff and landing to help with their ears popping.  At least use a pacifier during this time. Check some luggage and only carryon the necessities or what you can easily handle between the two of you.  Generally pack light.  There will be several times where one of you has to hold the baby and the other one will have to be able to carry or move pretty much everything else. Have a change of clothes for the baby and both of you.  Weve had diaper blowouts or big spit ups on  of the six flights that required a shirt change for one of us.,daddit,cr7tj6u,3,t5_2rxue

Know you may laugh smile cry wail and be angry within moments of each other until the emotions become less intense. Treasure the time the pictures the memories that you had with Rkkvi r.

5700797,1,t3_3t6zkn,This exact thing destroyed my marriage. Beware for you are likely at the beginning of a nightmare spiral that could wreck your life.The root of it is likely your wifes depression and insecurity. The less shes allowed to get away with doing and still enjoy all her privileges the more you can bet shell keep getting worse. this hurts and its hard to do but you have to set some hard boundaries and be prepared to enforce them. make her go to therapy. items x y and z must be done before I get home today. no excuses. take away that atm card. hide the remote. change the wifi password. do not let her badger you for hours on end to get her way. women love to confine you in a room and prevent you from leaving until they get everything they want. dont allow this look up your local laws for illegal confinement she is not allowed to block you in. she will likely go full passive assault on you telling all your mutual friends and family how horribly youre abusing her and the kid by depriving them refusing to sleep in the same room with you etc. But people will eventually come around and stop believing her crap. you have to stick that out people will be giving you sideeye for a while.I wish I could tell you this is a pathway to a happy ending but it might not be. Im just telling you what I wish someone told me  years ago. if she is reasonable and snaps out of it this is recoverable but if not she can still punch out of the marriage and take half your stuff so do whatever you have to to protect yourself. ,daddit,cx3qmbx,3,t5_2rxue
5718856,0,t3_3tfsud,I remember when I first did this. My wife went away for the weekend and I was left with my son for the first time. These other dudes are right  go run errands. I went to the mall. This is stupid as poop but one thing thatll help your confidence at the mall is that a dad alone with a baby gets ALL THE AWWWWS at the mall. Women will actually walk up to you and say cute baby or shes so sweet and then look at you like youre the father of the year I know I know societys standards are so low that just standing with your child puts you in the running for dad of the year. But nevertheless its a confidence booster if youre feeling like oh god am I getting this right?!I like the mall because theres a ton of stuff to look at. And hey maybe you can start Christmas shopping early? If not go to the book store and pick up a cute book you can read with your daughter. Like the other guys said going out and shopping will fill your day. If you can manage go out to a restaurant for dinner and take your time eating and feeding. If you cant manage and dude no ones judging you on that then treat yourself to takeoutdrivethrough and go home and enjoy dinner in front of the TV. Put on some silly kids shit thats colorful and singsongy my son used to love Yo Gabba Gabba  I dont know if thats still on but it entertaining for us adults too. Then read that book you picked up to your daughter at bedtime get her comfy changed and down and enjoy the rest of your night. Hopefully shes a good sleeper. If shes not...thats not my realm of expertise.MOST IMPORTANT just remember youre a good dad and your wife believes in you or she wouldnt be leaving. Be confident. And if you panic were here in this subreddit .,daddit,cx5zarf,3,t5_2rxue
5719893,0,t3_3tftqi,Touch up your training with your dog. Things like being able to order your dog out of the room or to go lie on a dog bed are very handy once your baby arrives. These need to be trained thoroughly in the presence of distractions. E.g. if your dog doesnt go lie down on one command with dog cookies on the floor there is little chance he will when there is a baby present either.Also loose leash walking. If you dog pulls now thatll just be more annoying when youre pushing a stroller. Teaching your dog how to walk beside a stroller is useful.General dog manners and self control things not diving for food etc. that is dropped on the ground stuff like that. ,daddit,cx63xlh,1,t5_2rxue

5775456,0,t1_cxcyv2j,My daughter has an incredible grasp on language its frightening sometimes. Over the last few weeks its like the floodgates have opened and she is forming a lot of short sentences. At her  month checkup the doctor was very surprised at the number of words she used just there in front of her and we said her vocabulary was well beyond the  words she heard in that  minute visit. I am sure some of it is repetition but she knows a lot of words and understands their meaning. If I am picking up around the house she will look around find other things around the house and put them away or pick up trash and bring it to the trash can. When the batteries die in a toy she brings me the toy and says it needs help dada. This past week she is recognizing what bathroom activities are. She tells us as she is pooping that she has to poop and wants to sit on her little potty when we go to the bathroom. No successful potty for her yet but with her understanding what it means its only a matter of time.Yet it was nearly  months until my daughter walked. She never really grasped crawling until  months instead scooting around on her butt or belly flopping around. She runs around like a nut now but it took her a lot longer than her peers in daycare of a similar age to keep up with them. She spoke way before they did and I have yet to hear anything more than some single words or grunts out of others her age but they have much better handeye coordination than my daughter. She has very little interest in throwing a ball around or playing with toys in general. We have a little kitchen set with fake food that keeps her busy for a little while but otherwise she would rather just walk around showing us toys and objects asking what they areits name and what it does. My wife has her masters degree in early childhood development and said this is not uncommon. Each child develops differently and ours just happens to have a very good ability to pick up language but her motor skills are a few months behind. Eventually it will all catch up all we can do is find where she is strong and continue to expand her abilities to the best we can. ,daddit,cxczzjp,5,t5_2rxue

6170622,0,t3_4012ee,I used to run my own business parttime. I also was raising my son the other half of the time. It became too difficult for me to run the business and I wasnt making enough money to keep it so we decided to sell it about a year ago. Since then my wife has been the bread winner and we have had a second child. I have become the stay at home dad. I dont remember my first child son being so difficult. I dont know if my second daughter is more difficult or just raising her and a . year old is just tough but I find myself struggling really hard daily. The wife works graveyard right now and it is really hard to express my difficulties with her cause I know that she has problems of her own. She would rather be at home with the babies than sleeping all day and working at night. Id rather be the bread winner I just cant make the money that she makes to maintain our expenses. I have broken down and cried once but I mostly find my self angry at night when Im trying to get her to sleep. It gets really difficult to get her to sleep I usually holder her for  mins to an hour and sometimes right when I go to put her in the crib she wakes up and starts crying. Those are my most difficult times.I also find it difficult to deal with the toddler sometimes. I have to tell myself that he doesnt mean to wake his sister up destroy something scream...etc he is just a toddler. I think itll only get easier as she gets older but till then I cherish sleep and alone time. I also miss just spending time with the wife. Its a struggle but I can see light at the end of the tunnel.

I too took  weeks off when he was born.  I normally work  ten hour days.  Im currently working  ten hour days and will be potentially until July but now thinking Ill come back full time in February.  This was so I could spend more time with my new son.  But Im almost  and have very little formal education beyond high school so Im going back to college I started again while wife was pregnant and am in my third session.  In spring Ill be doing  or  classes along with work and baby boy.  School was going to be for engineering but now Im leaning towards math or physics.  I spend a lot of time in rfinancialindependence and I hope to start phasing out of my career within  years to run a food truck.  I love cooking and feeding people and I think a food truck would be a blast.Im in a technical trades field and run an advanced facility.  We do meaningful work that benefits a large number of people although most dont realize it much of the time. I used to come in and get worked up about my job and require things be just so.  Now IDGAF.  So long as I get to go home to my wife and boy thats what matters.

We give it an enzyme spray right quick and toss it in the hamper. No smell or anything. Occasionally youll have a major poo situation. Get a cheap spatula from the dollar store and just scrape the solids off. Done.We dont have nearly the collection other families do and we do diaper laundry about once a week. Ymmv.

6507948,0,t3_44s0se,I once heard someone say I never knew it was possible to survive with your heart outside your body until I became a parent.  It is like most of my life was waiting in line and now Ive boarded the rollercoaster.  The highs are higher the scares are scarier it goes faster than you want it to but you always are looking forward to that next big thrill.  Do what you can to prepare and just assume that it isnt enough.  The best parts  When I come peek in the crib and my crying daughter stops and smiles up at me.  When I walk in the door after a shit day and she grins and reaches for me.  Hearing giggles.The worst parts  People joke about poop but I would clean up the most heinous diaper a dozen times rather than deal with nonstop crying through the night.  Lack of sleep is tough.  I also ache at times when I know I have to let her get hurt or learn something the hard way rather than putting a shell around her forever.  I didnt really give up anything for good.  I racked my kayak for a year but Ill get it back out come spring now that I have sitters I trust.  I stopped PC gaming for a while but am now getting back to sneaking an hour here and there after she is asleep or during naps on the weekend.  I got really bad at prepping healthy meals for the week and exercising regularly but have started making time for those again.  I am way behind on a lot of TV shows but really dont mind that at all.  Im super lucky to have family and friends that gladly will sit while I take the wife out or go out on my own and I know a lot of guys dont have that.  There is a period where you give up a lot of interaction and hobbies but in my experience the hobbies that you really enjoy youll find time to keep them up.  You may have to compromise but you shouldnt have to completely give up anything that you really love.  And now youll have another person to share the hobby with when she gets old enough.,daddit,czsgz2g,3,t5_2rxue

Pack a little bag for each kid with some treats and little toys but dont let them see or know about the bag. When theyre getting bored or cranky get something for each kid out of the bag.

Ask the airline before you book. For me the layovers were the hard part. It was tough keeping a toddler entertained in an airport in Amsterdam for  hours until our next flight. My suggestion is to bring a bunch of toys games coloring books etc. If you got a tablet with a bunch of games on it that helps too. Most airports now have free USB charging stations and wifi as do the seats on the planes. Also dont forget to pack some headphones for her so that she could watch some animated films during the flight.  ,daddit,d26609q,1,t5_2rxue

7528813,0,t1_d2xukiw,This will be a bit long so bear with me. Fell in love with a girl the first time I laid eyes on her. I told her then th grade Id some day marry her. She rightfully laughed in my face. She and I quickly became friends. Because who doesnt want to be friends with a psycho like that right???Throughout high school I was still in love with her. Had a couple of girlfriends as you can tell Im not the most attractive guy but nothing compared to her. Had a falling out thanks to a bf she had senior year until she came to me with Im pregnant. First thought uh.. it aint mine! But of course I didnt vocalize that. I supported her through her pregnancy and the guy leaving her because hes a douche bad that wasnt ready for a kid. After highschool went our separate ways I to college her to work force as a single mom. We continued being great friends me still in love her in love with the idea of having a guy she could depend on even if he looked like me.A couple years later  I have graduate college twice AASs and tried to find a career as a cop. Heres the thing about that I applied to  minimum departments and couldnt get hired. Any place that accepts government money EMS must hire vets first. So anyone who joined after the attacks of September   and was a cook in the Army GO NAVY BEAT ARMY! AGAIN!! got hired over me. So  I joined the Navy. Cant beat them join them then beat them. I professed my love once again and reminded her of our high school pact and asked if shed honor it. If we werent married by  wed marry eachother. She said we could try and date.  got married. Now to the meat and potatos. His bio dad about a year after hearing of our wedding having had NO contact with his offspring for  years by this point started asking when I would adopt so he didnt have to pay child support anymore. We started the process then the Marine Corps happened and I went to AFG. I played in the sand for a while and came back to start the process again. USMC legal didnt read wouldnt help us with the adoption. Call it understaffing over work or simply because Navy owns Marines and they resent it. HA!So after I transferred to San Diego area the Navy was a lot more helpful. The two things that took the most time were getting the bio dad read sperm donor as hes not much else sign off the form the proper way and getting the court to agree to let me adopt. I had some adjustment problems coming back and needed help with it. Rightfully this made the court apprehensive. But they agreed nearly a year later and I finally adopted my son. The thing is it wasnt until someone ELSE pointed out he was my stepson at the time that i realized he was. Because of my love and closeness to my best friend and eventually wife I had never even considered him to be anything less than my son. We just had to make it legal.My advice to anyone in the Navy or Marine Corps who is adopting get help through legal. They will create and help file the documents for you. Also Im not sure about the Army or AF but the first two will pay you back ALL the money you spend in an adoption AND give you  days of permissive TAD free leave after the adoption is finalized. EDIT So I found out the form to request reimbursement for adoptions is a DOD form. Meaning all services can request reimbursement DD .,daddit,d2xzmil,66,t5_2rxue

7847088,0,t3_4msryt,My wife had gestational diabetes and my daughter was born with such low blood sugar that it didnt register on the reading. They rushed her off to the NICU and she was hooked up to an IV for  days until she was able to regulate her own blood sugar. The good thing out of it was that the hospital we went to was very small  maternity rooms in all and a NICU that could only handle  babies at a time. We were the only ones with a baby in the NICU and they told us her situation was common. They let us spend a lot of time with her throughout the day since low blood sugar just meant a nurse was monitoring her every hour. We spent an extra day in the hospital because the doctor wanted to be sure that my daughter didnt become dependent on the IV to maintain her blood sugar. Three days after she was born she was perfectly healthy with no signs of any issues with maintaining her sugars and  years later its just a memory. Do everything you can to make your wife happy. If she is able walk down with her to the NICU as much as you can to see your son. Its scary to have your baby rushed off somewhere else but its important to ensure he is healthy and his blood sugar can be maintained on his own. Our doctor kept telling us that its absolutely nothing to be concerned about and they react this way to give the babys system the jump start it needs to learn to regulate their blood sugar properly. Let your wife know everything is going to be okay and try to have her get some rest. ,daddit,d3y2yac,2,t5_2rxue

8023791,0,t1_d4hxs3e,That is what I was getting at for the parents. If they are already not in favor of him but think their precious little daughter never does any wrong then the legal battle could be a little more intense if the parents push hard enough and hire a good lawyer. Thankfully he has no assets to speak of so there is nothing to go after there but they can make the visitations a nightmare. I have a coworker whose wife has a child from another marriage. The father of that child is an absolute jerk and sits on a pile of money. So he makes their lives a nightmare just because he can never thinking about how jerking around a little girl between visitations causes her more problems than anything else. He does it just because it upsets his exwife. I am not alluding to this happening here but if the parents are jerks about it and want to feed money to the battle it could be drawn out and revisited often over the course of this poor childs life. Still I cannot stress to OP how important it is to get the legal process started now. After figuring out a living situation its the very next thing to get started.You are right terminating parental rights is difficult and in this case where mom seems more lazy than anything else a judge will never TPR unless there is some sign of abuse drugs or some other real reason to rule mom entirely out of the picture. Based on what weve been told here there is absolutely no reason to TPR and the courts wouldnt go down that path.As far as courts favoring moms I think that depends on the state and the judge. My wife works in the foster care system and at least here in the state of Maine the courts do a good job of balancing time between mom and dad unless there is a reason not to. My parents divorced when I was  and my dad had us all week long and every other weekend so its not unheard of to have rulings in dads favor either. If OP really does have documentation proving mom is giving up as well as multiple texts videos and other evidence to support that he should be the primary caregiver I dont think a judge will rule for mom unless we arent hearing the entire story here.,daddit,d4hy6no,1,t5_2rxue

8377631,0,t3_4ucpqh,As others have said it all sounds like typical newborn stuff. Weve got three kids each of whom were very different in their newbornness. All of what youve described sounds quite normal. Having a kid is probably the hardest thing youll do but also hopefully the most rewarding. As to your points here are some of my thoughts Newborns have weird reflexes and usually randomly move around. For sleeping you should be swaddling him. This will keep his limbs secure but will also make him feel like hes still inside mommys belly which is what hes used to. So get your swaddling skills nailed so that the little guy cant really move once swaddled.  Vaginal births literally squeeze the baby as it comes through which has the benefit of pushing out mucus from their lungs. Sometimes theres a bit left. If it was a Csection delivery therell probably be some left to spit up. Probably normal.   Getting a newborn used to sleeping on their own can be massively frustrating. Every kid is unique and youll unfortunately just have to find his rhythm and what works for him. Our second kid would scream around the clock unless we held him . It was about  months of literally holding that kid all the time. Now that kid is soooo cuddly and its wonderful! Sometimes thats what the kid needs and youll have to give it to them. Newborns are really hard. Over time youll find your rhythm and it will get better. It might get better in  weeks or  months or in  months but it will get better. Also never feel bad about bringing your baby into the ER. Never feel like youre bothering them or that youre being too paranoid. ,daddit,d5or47h,2,t5_2rxue

8415913,0,t3_4usxzd,A wise mentor of mine gave me the advice as we approached our due date that its ok to not like your baby at first in fact plan on it. The first few months are rough. Babies poop pee eat and sleep and in between each of these they cry. While moms may still form some attachment because of the intimacy of breastfeeding its easy as a dad to not feel all that much early on because we dont get much feedback.

8819658,0,t3_50yhd9,Dad of  yr old twins here... For the first few months everything should be on a schedule. They should eat and sleep at the same time and on a constant schedule. It will lighten the load a bit. We fed our girls every  hours for the first weeks. For each feed wed switch responsibility for each girl. This allowed us to bond with both but it also prevented all fights. If my baby was very fussy or needed a lot of changing there was no discussion. It was my baby so I did it. After  hours we switched. Some days one of us would be stuck with all the poops and fussing but it was completely arbitrary and fair which helped a lot. The first few weeks are going to be hard. There is no changing that. You just have to buckle down and get through it. In a few weeks itll get easier and it continues to get easier and a LOT more fun. Right now I have two toddlers pretending to be swimming together on the carpet. Its hilarious to watch and be a part of. Good luck! Youll do great. ,daddit,d7803gi,19,t5_2rxue

8882500,0,t3_51t8ub,My daughter figured out the childproofing cabinet latches we installed within the first few minutes she saw themat  months old. Based on that we decided instead to move any household chemicals into our laundry room on an overhead cabinet. As for sharp corners on furniture we have never padded them. Children are going to get hurt and they are going to run into things. The real world isnt padded so we figured if our daughter is going to learn a lesson she might as well early on. She has bumped into things and had a few bruises or scrapes but nothing that isnt remedied by a bandaid.The only thing I did take some time to childproof was to install tamper resistant outlets throughout the house. We have an older farmhouse with outlets that were installed in the early s. They worked just fine but rather than put in those little plastic protectors in the outlets I just bought a couple of packs of tamper resistant outlets and switched them out. Then I didnt have to worry about pulling those stupid caps off every time I needed to use an outlet and make sure to put it back they have childproofing built in.,daddit,d7fju6c,1,t5_2rxue

9937088,0,t3_5hqff5,I swear to god the amount of handwringing over this subject mystifies me.  Ive never met an adult whose relationship with their parents was ruined because of Santa the Tooth Fairy the Easter Bunny etc.  When I was old enough to realize the truth it wasnt traumatic  I honestly dont even remember exactly how it happened.  I think I just grew out of it.  In retrospect I see it as a fun part of childhood fantasy that my parents indulged in.  We now do the same thing with our kids.My oldest is  and finally has admitted he knows the truth.  I think hes probably been faking it for a year or two but has been playing the odds.  He doesnt seem heartbroken by it.  He seems to enjoy getting to play the other side now like helping put out Easter Eggs last year for his younger siblings.If youre not religious or simply choose not to do Santa with your kids or want to be less materialistic more power to you.

So get all of the expensive stuff done right away Get him seen by Family practice or Pediatrics. Psychologist. Probably speech therapy. Immunizations.

10846509,0,t3_5uwmx5,Just throwing this out there because you never know Watch for requent urination or weight loss.I know its probably just a  year old being a  year old but this happened to us when my son was . Then he started to lose weight and urinating frequently. We were well passed the bed wetting stage then all of a sudden he wet the bed twice.Turned out he is a Type  Diabetic. Low or high bloodsugar can do really bad things to your childs mood and is usually the first sign that children exhibit.If hes showing any other signs please do yourself a favour and get his blood sugar checked.Two and a half years later I now run a Type  Diabetic support group in my area and this is always the first sign. Its tough because this is also the age where they start talking back and become angry over little things.After my son was diagnosed rushed to a hospital and was introduced to insulin injections his behaviour was polar opposite and his symptoms went away instantly. We spent  days in the hospital getting his body back to normal and learning everything there is to know about TD. We actually had to take two written tests to ensure we understood it well enough to care for my son.There is a lot of misinformation out there so let me go through my quick spiel Type  Diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Your immune system attacks and kills the insulin producing beta cells aka islets rendering your body unable to produce insulin. Your body uses insulin to convert carbohydrates that your body breaks down and turns it into energy. Without that energy conversion your body will begin using your stored energy fat to keep your body functioning. The sideeffect is noticable weight loss. When your body burns fat it produces ketones basically acid which stays in your blood stream until you urinate it out. Your bodys natural response is to increase urin production which dehydrates you and causes you to drink more to flush out the ketones. Too many ketones will cause headaches mood swings and if undiagnosed will cause death.It has nothing to do with diet exercise genetics or family history. It can strike anyone at any time but is most common in children aged .,daddit,ddyqozf,2,t5_2rxue

11073682,0,t3_5y4gow,Is she doing solo child care while youre at work? I would say be prepared to take over when you get home and let her rest as much as possible. Figure out quick easy dinners or pick something up just try to take the stress off her as much as possible when you get home let her nap or watch an hour of tv or get out of the house for a while or whatever. My wife got a little stir crazy between when I went back to work and when she did. How is your daughter sleeping? For the first month our son wouldnt sleep unless he was being held so we would trade off holding him and catnapping with actually trying to sleep so we kind of had a shift thing going so one person would actually get some blocks of uninterrupted sleep. The other thing that really helped was writing down every time he went to sleep and woke up and every time he ate. This is more for later  months when they develop more of a schedule. That way when you take over you can look at the journal and know approximately when she will be sleepy or hungry again. We did kind of soft sleep training starting at  weeks and that helped too. You can start as early as  weeks its not for everyone but it really worked for us. just helping him get on a schedule allowed us to plan our lives. Another protip naps in your car at lunch. if you get an hour lunch break go catch some shuteye. Saved me for that first month or two. ,daddit,den6wxp,5,t5_2rxue

11262353,0,t1_df84abi,From a vocabulistic point of view it could qualify for  but the content of the book itself could easily be better rated as  if they want to crack down on the murder of  kid and detailed accounts of hunting. Though the kids themselves are within that age range. Love the list though. ,daddit,df8kkko,1,t5_2rxue

Happy birthday to your little one !!! ,daddit,dgg22si,5,t5_2rxue
11652189,0,t1_dfxit6x,Sorry for just now answering your questions.The cameras take pictures of the top half of the fridge each time you close the doors.  That way you can always see a pic of whats inside it when it was last closed.  The way you handle expiration dates is through an app on the door.  You use little balloons and drag them over the item then put a date on them.  There are a few other apps that my wife uses like the photo slide show calendar and shopping list.  There might be a few more...idk.  I completely agree with most people that this thing is mostly a gimmick.  Then again... I used to think I wanted buttons on my cell phone.  Maybe Ill change my mind on this technology as well.  I just keep going back to my original justification....  my wife loves it.  ,daddit,dggsg6k,1,t5_2rxue

11706933,0,t3_671ax1, is pretty crazy because youre learning a lot of new things and your schedule drastically changes as a whole swath of things becomes impossible. is not so bad as you already know what to do and youve already resigned yourself to the fact that youre not going out to all the things you used to.  Overall the workload isnt that much more but it does take a bit more scheduling.So to answer your question yes.  It is easier knowing what to expect.  That said every kid is different and youll still come across new things to deal with that werent a problem with your first. is a trap because you get over confident handling two kids fine.  Once the third one comes you realise youre outnumbered...,daddit,dgn0dr0,10,t5_2rxue
11715039,0,t1_dgnftlo,No kidding! The whole breast is best movement drives my wife and I nuts. While breast milk is technically healthier a FED baby is best. Is my son growing and a happy child? Yes! So shut up and mind your own business. You may be lucky enough to have a job and life that allows you to breast feed or pump but not everyone is so lucky. So as long as hes getting enough nutrition who cares. Plus I know tons of moms who never shut up online about breastfeeding. Then we get together and their babies are eating pizza or cupcakes or other crap. Meanwhile my son is devouring veggies like no ones business. Do you realize how hypocritical you really are?,daddit,dgnxg54,4,t5_2rxue

11729328,0,t1_dgo8j0t,Its ok to cry.  Weve had moments like this a bunch and were only at four weeks.If you havent read it yet theres a book called Happiest Baby on the Block by Dr. Harvey Kemp.  It saved my life.  The loud sustained SHHH to stop crying the white noise recommendations deep and rumbly sustained kept him sleeping which helps everything else and knowing that this is ok and hell sometimes just scream its all good.We tried things like pumping to get her sleep or fomula but he vomited up ALL the formula and even the small bottle we finally pumped. God knows she wasnt producing much because of how little sleep our dude gave us.  He fed like every  minutes.  Anyway It takes time.  The most important thing is sleep and making sure your lady goes to sleep even if shes ambivalent.  Breast is best and it DOES eventually click.  We had so many problems latching and almost gave up too.  Its hard.,daddit,dgpjt0k,1,t5_2rxue
11731649,0,t3_67ccor,Keep his hair it looks cool. Its nice having kids look different and why should everyone have to conform to the buzzcut look. Be original! ,daddit,dgpt9sn,4,t5_2rxue
11732099,0,t3_67eccg,Im with you OP. A stranger should never touch my child unless they are saving their life. Especially if they pick them up. Happened to me one time and if my wife wasnt there I would of lost it.,daddit,dgpv3sp,5,t5_2rxue
11752761,0,t3_66zbzz,I have both a burley bee trailer and a thule ride along mini front.  I always prefer taking the two year old in the front seat as it makes riding easier.  Basically me being a selfish biker  . I wouldnt and didnt use it until he was ym old as I i wanted him to have maximum neck and torso control.  He loves it though... hes gone out for  hour rides with me before with most being in the . hour range.  Now that I have a  month old we only use it on weekends when mom can watch his brother.From a safety perspective the trailer is obviously miles ahead and I can see why most people think the frontseat is scary.,daddit,dgs7e07,1,t5_2rxue
11759260,0,t3_67pdou,One thing I make sure I do is have my son look me dead in the eyes when I explain things to him and have HIM repeat what the consequences are.Also I think you need not be afraid of putting a little fear into your son. I dont mean that hes afraid just that he knows you mean business. Even toddlers understand empty threats once theyve seen you make them enough they need to know that when you make a threat that its legit. My son went through a phase like this and it was tough he had a lot of time outs and toys taken away. But now he knows the rules and that if he breaks them he wont like what happens. I have him  days a week and I think he has had  timeout in the last month. He still wont listen all the time but he knows when the serious voice comes out that its time to start,daddit,dgsxx32,2,t5_2rxue
