7938817,0,t3_4nztbq,Since you are pushing for it so hard I guess I have no choice but to provide my alibi.The only reason I have been so unwilling to share as it would have added to the confusion and made this trial a whole bunch more suspicious of me spending as much time as I did on those documents.On Day  at around PM I was with Nekomaru Chihiro Makoto and Chiaki as they watched their motives. I refused to watch my own as I knew itd be a trap. Im sure you all know what happened from there.After the meeting I ran into Nagito I knew all too well that hed been planning something. what it was however I was suspicious about. I made a note to keep watch over him at some point but I never got around too it.Later on I checked the teachers lounge and head masters office and found those documents as Makoto and myself mentioned earlier. I spent awhile checking and coming up with Theories but to no avail..Before I went to sleep I checked the chemlab and found something had been taken although now that I look at it it must have been Celestes poison as I remember the medications to still be there.The next morning I waited in my room still thinking of what those documents could have meant. then after the tea party happened I found Makoto and dragged him aside and told him to look at the paperwork.Before the blackout I felt worried for Chihiro and Ibuki listening to them talk about an announcement I didnt even hear so I followed them to make sure it wasnt a trap but it was..After the blackout Im sure you know what comes next... we found Sayakas body and I ran into Makoto and the others and informed them Sayaka was dead.,DanganRoleplay,d48ec2z,3,t5_3ckk4

8623689,0,t1_d6jj2vp,Were not trying to measure achievement though. Were trying to increase participation. Even viewing consecutive sign ups as a good thing is a matter of your own perspective. Systemic favoritism promotes desirable behavior. From the perspective of trying to get new comers in the guy whos gotten in  times already getting in again is undesirable. If what youre saying is I dont like that our sign up system encourages people who havent played recently to make it in and if its not please correct me since thats the impression Ive gotten so far thats fine  but were coming at this from two fundamentally different angles.  The logic has been that if you want to make a more inclusive and friendly community youre going to want to get people who havent been involved involved. If you disagree with that premise youll have to elaborate why you disagree. Because that is the whole point of the priority system. Of course if people who havent played a lot are coming in someone has to sit out and the people favored to sit out are the people whove already gotten to play a ton. But again thats not the crux of the issue. Theres no way to include new people without having people who have been participating sit out unless you increase trial size or number of concurrent trials. After all if we sit out new people to let more new people play the net effect is weve done nothing.The question is is getting people who havent been involved involved a good thing for the community? If so is the current proposal an effective way of doing it?Edit There is also the matter of the physical scramble during sign ups but I think that is out of the scope of this proposal.,DanganRoleplay,d6jk9yd,1,t5_3ckk4

8670886,0,t3_4ypcqg,If youre all done making idiots of yourselves I might be willing to give you my information.My morning was quite typical for a Togami. I awoke early and prepared for my day. When the time came I had breakfast in the cafeteria and then headed to the library.A certain halfwituSoccr  followed me no doubt to talk to me about Fukawa. I must have made it clear that I would rather let the Togami name end with me than I would to consider her for even a second considering she didnt bother me further.I went to the gym when we were all called. Id rather not spend any more time with you than I have to but I dont intend to get myself killed for some silly rule violation. Regardless I didnt have any interest in this dinner motive so I returned to the library. Perhaps due to my charisma I had another follower this time. As I continued to read my own material Kirigiri searched the archive. I can only assume that such material is casual reading for someone that handles dead bodies as a hobby. Regardless she stayed inside for more than an hour before I checked inside to see that she hadnt offed herself. She seemed to be quite shaken but after pouting briefly the two of us went to have lunch.While dining Naegi invited both Kirigiri and myself to some movie night they had planned but I declined and having more sense than I expected Kirigiri did as well. I left the area early as soon as a food fight was mentioned. I returned to my room not wanting to be followed again and stayed there until  at which point I returned to the library.Whether he followed me or not I admit I do not know but the hope fetishist entered moments after I did. He did not last long under my withering glare and left after around twenty minutes. At  I saw several of you carry the delusional breeder past and went the opposite direction to the greenhouse. I think youve already figured out the obvious conclusion so I have no more to say on this matter.Moments after I arrived Naegi Komaeda and Nanami showed themselves as well. I took Naegi aside to the library to have him tell me what he knew. He showed me nothing so I showed him the door. I did my own research in the archive until  trying to find some method to this madness before losing interest. I intended to return to my room when I was rudely interrupted by a scream from the bathroom. I take it you need no further explanation.,DanganRoleplay,d6phchu,3,t5_3ckk4

Your classmates are trying to discover who murdered one of their own and all you care to do is trail off on vague comments and make flimsy defenses.In addition to your constant foreboding That doesnt fit in with when I sentence fragments you claimed your headache was from a new perfume you were trying. Chloroform has an etherlike scent so the cause of the sweet smell at the crime scene was more than likely your perfume.It was you who spent most of the day in the laundry room right next to the bath where Chihiro was killed. At any point in the day you could have sneaked over there and attacked him. You claim to have been in the infirmary until  but Gundham was unconscious and Mikan left you alone for a great deal of time.You were also one of the people who knew of Kazuichis plan to slaughter a chicken for dinner. With this knowledge you wouldve known hed need a knife so you waited for an opportunity to steal the knife hed borrowed from the kitchen to use as your murder weapon.You also clearly came into this trial expecting Chihiro to be dead from a cause besides drowning because when we worked out that Chihiro mightve been drowned you were visibly shocked.Tell us what you know. umayakaibara ,DanganRoleplay,d6q71f7,1,t5_3ckk4

8689301,0,t3_4yziqt,All right! Everyone is unsure of whats fact and fiction so Im here to make sure that everything is all straightened up! You can thank me later!First up! By now weve determined that sometime around PM as we know Chihiro was planning to go to the rec room at PM to meet with Chiaki as said in the note in his room! Chihiro was escorted away from his original path to go to the Rec Room. The Killer probably grabbed him and used the chloroform they gathered and took Chihiro to the bathroom to carry out their plan.Note on Chihiros roombulletIts probably like this... The Killer placed Chihiro down undressed him so it would look like he was bathing on purpose and set the shower to run. Thanks to our investigations we figured out the shower would fill the bath in about two hours.Oh! Dont forget that I was the one that let you guys all know that the shower head wasnt tampered with once and for all!Shower headbulletBut anyway... The Killer dumped the chloroform into the bath let it go down the drain and then plugged it up so that the water would fill up and eventually drown Chihiro. Which mean the Killer would be able to have an alibi from that point onwards.All the Killer would have to do is take the clothes and the chloroform bottle and dispose of the evidence. Now... Im unsure whether they went to the trash room to incinerate them immediately or whether they realised it was open later so threw the clothes and the chloroform bottle in then but either way the evidence was disposed of!Trash room itemsbulletAfter that around PM when Chihiro had already died to drowning Sayaka took part in her own plot. Around PM she found the knife I dropped after I killed those chickens and she stored it in the bathroom lockers. When she came back to dispose of it she realised there was dripping sounds in the bathroom.That is where she found Chihiro. As shes already described to us she saw it as a perfect chance and immediately went to hold his head under the water. When she thought he was dead and she didnt realise he was already she tried to fix the crime scene to her own liking.She hung up her slightly wet tracksuit and she found another tracksuit in the laundry room to dress Chihiro in. Then she stabbed Chihiro with that kitchen knife. The mop was used to clean up the water that had been spilled and I guess she must have emptied the bathtub at that time too. Dont forget because the chloroform had been emptied out into the bath some of the residue got caught by the water and thats how it got on Chihiros skin.Kitchen KnifebulletMopbulletGreen tracksuitbulletSayakas tracksuitbulletChloroformbulletSo... All that remains is to figure out who did the original crime sometime between  and PM and who was planning to return to the crime scene before the girls bath happened. After all they probably werent done with fixing the scene to their liking and they discovered that someone else had already done it instead.At first... I thought Nagito was suspect because he was the one doing trash duty but since he left the gate open anyone could have used it. I then thought about Mikan since she was annoyed at Miss Sonia and Chiaki for not including her for the movie night plans. But... even Mikan isnt petty enough to kill someone for it.Hagakure is... himself. I dont think he could plan to murder anybody. Makoto is a potential since he left Komarus room at PM and went to get a snack... But you know its him. Miss Aoi is also way out of the question. Shes too nice she wouldnt hurt a fly!Hey Miss Sonia are you jealous? Miss Aoi is shaping up to be one heck of a gal! uOrblet Im kind of digressing here. In my mind theres only one person that could have done it and I think everyone else is of the same opinion. Komaru doesnt have a good alibi between  and PM. She also returned nearby the crime scene and found Sayaka in the Laundry room sometime between PM and PM. With PM being the time that the girls bath was scheduled she would have wanted to adjust the scene before then so PM and PM is a perfect time!I bet Komaru went there to fix up the scene just before the girls bath happened and she got distracted on the way by Sayaka! Shes a girl and she knew everyone was planning on going to the bathroom after all! Theres no way one of us guys could have done it for that reason!Im all pumped up!

11423949,0,t1_dfqvixc,WWhat?! Youre kidding... But that would...Does that really make sense? If Mukuro attacked me then was she planning to kill either Peko or Nekomaru? Its not like she could have killed all three of us isnt that disallowed?Dammit I knew leaving her with Nagito was a bad fucking idea!Shit... I was the one that brought Peko with us too.

11624575,0,t3_65tpqi,This was an amazing experience and an amazing trial. While I dont think I did great this trial was phenomenal and pretty much everyone was IC. Akane Kazuichi Mondo Celeste Byakuya everyone played their parts well. Mondo and Byakuya are probably the standout solvers for me but everyone brought up valid points. Monokuma and Monomi did very well at preserving the mystery and being comic relief! Just everything about this case was very very good.,DanganRoleplay,dgdno7g,2,t5_3ckk4

11807899,0,t1_dgygp39,You beat me to suggesting it Celeste.But yes its likely that the rope was used to move the motor. And if thats what happened since we had the rope for the party that means the murder occurred before the party happened.,DanganRoleplay,dgygsob,1,t5_3ckk4
