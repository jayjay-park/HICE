I would like to see an unbiased opinion on the matter. Although from what Ive heard this does not sound like the best plan for a sustainable local economy as their is a possibility that this plan could fall trough. What if by the time we gain this water line the local levels are already too low?  And it sounds like this is the case even now.  ,CastleRock,cr12d72,2,t5_2vvhm
