As hunters being on high ground helps you avoid most of the wildlife without having to watch for it gives you better visibility and lets you spoil ambushes.

2273958,0,t3_2l9spl,Val Medic  Keep teammates alive with your medgun and healing burst. Hitting the monster with a tranquilizing dart slows him down and marks him for your whole team to see him through walls for about  seconds. Your sniper rifle creates weak points on the monster but I find it less useful in general compared to healing and tranquilizing the monster. Youll be a high priority target so try to stay behind your teammates. You can revive teammates from a downed state by healing them with your medgun.Hank Support  Keep your teammates alive with your shieldgunthing. Especially the medic. Your shield gun loses power quickly so you can switch to your main gun and do some damage while its recharging. If you see a shot you can take with your airstrike like if you catch the monster evolving go ahead and take it just be aware that your airstrike will do a bit of damage and a lot of knockback to any teammates it hits. Use your AoE invisibility to keep yourself and your team safer during fights or to try and sneak up on an unaware monster. I think you can also use it while downed so people can help you up easier.Maggie Trapper  Your biggest job is to land your mobile arena with the monster inside and then stay alive. When the trapper goes down the mobile arena does too. Otherwise it lasts a very long time. While in an arena spam harpoon traps wherever the monster is or where you think he will walk towards. When looking for the monster try to predict where he will go and cut him off. Just following in his footsteps is usually pretty useless because hes much faster than you. Your pet Daisy can help point you in the right direction but dont rely on her too much. If you miss the arena you can hold down the button you use to equip it and that takes it back down so your teammates can get out.Markov Assault  Shoot things. Lightning gun is pretty short range but high damage. Switch to assault rifle if you need long range. In a fight try using all the charge on your lightning gun and then lay some mines while the gun recharges. Use personal shield whenever the monster gets in your face to wreck you.Monster in general  Sneaking around is very important. It leaves no footprints so its harder for the hunters to find you. It will also make it so you can sneak around flocks of birds without alerting them that leads the hunters to you as well. The idea is to sneakrun away from the hunters killing and eating wildlife. You dont want to get into a fight at stage one unless you know what you are doing. Once youve eaten enough you can find a safe place to evolve takes about  seconds and you lose whatever armor you have when you evolve so be careful!. At stage  you can probably take the hunters in a fight once youve built up some armor. You can also try to continue on to stage  and become even stronger.Goliath  I like to start with  in charge leap and fire breath. Charge and leap are great for mobility and fire breath is good to kill groups wildlife quickly. I love the stamina regen perk you can nearly cross the map in one sequence of leaps and skill usage. Your leaps with the jump button are really really strong because they go so far and recharge pretty quick. With some clever use of sneaking and leaping you should be able to at least get to stage  with a full or mostly full armor bar. This should be all you need to kill the hunters but if they still cant find you continue to stage  by all means.I like to max fire breath at stage  and rock throw at stage . I feel like charge and leap especially leap are more useful as mobilityCCutility while rock throw fire and your melee attacks do the real damage. I think a lot of people severely underestimate rock throw. The damage it does on a direct hit at level  is insane and it gives Goliath the useful benefit of a ranged attack. Its less useful in certain terrain or indoor areas but its not too hard to hit in most situations. You can skip it if you dont think its useful and just put  points in everything else.Kraken  Youll want to start by getting a wireless keyboard and throwing it in a washing machine with a few bricks. This should be sufficient to win. I kid but Kraken is extremely strong right now. Lightning strike and vortex are his best abilities and not only do great damage but knock hunters away if it hits them interrupting whatever they were doing. You have melee attacks while on the ground and ranged attacks while flying. Banshee mines can be used as simple projectile attacks if you dont get a chance to set them up as an ambush but I dont find them terribly useful. Aftershock does great damage but its so slow that most hunters can just jetpack away before it hits them. Try saving it for a cramped area. Your gameplan in a fight is to fly above the monsters and rain lightning bolts vortexes and basic ranged attacks down on the hunters along with banshee mines if you levelled them. You have less mobility than the Goliath since your airdashes dont travel nearly as far as his leaps and your abilities dont give you any extra mobility. You can fly over gaps to try to leave the hunters behind though. Be aware that you still leave footprints or footprintlike things behind while flying so you need to sneak if you want to be stealthy. Also tranquilizers affect the Kraken more harshly than the Goliath because he cant leap and his flying turns very sluggish while tranquilized. If you manage to find the cooldown reduction buff as a Kraken you could probably just go and kill or severely harass the hunters right there even at stage .Edit typo,EvolveGame,clss3gp,3,t5_2zo6k

2327721,0,t1_clzevhw,Whats illogical about having the population reflect the real world if only a tiny bit?  Every game has mostly male characters but I never see a game like this where most of the characters happen to be female.  Its always the other way around.  People only think its irrelevant because they dont personally care or theyre used to it.  Personally I feel if its such a nonissue to people why do they feel the need top fight against it. If you dont care about the gender of characters then you wont mind when the next set is all female.  I preferred hank anyway because I care about gameplay but again itd be nice if half the time my selection wound up being female instead of almost never since I tend not to like healers and my friend wants to play as the girl so one of us doesnt get to.  More than one is good.  One for each class would be fair.  Its really telling that such minor request receives such a back lash from other gamers.

2625215,0,t3_2pwsph,Ok well you are only referring to the hunt mode. The game itself has very good diversity.But onto your point I do agree that if a team gets a turtle team of markov maggie and bucket the monster is pretty boned.I recall a match during the big alpha. I was with my friend playing with two pubs. I was markov he was hank. Our trapper was awful. I was better at tracking the monster even if he had daisy. Alas Markov doesnt have a mobile arena so i could only chip away at his armor with my assault rifle. Needless to say we didnt get any HP damage on him a Goliath. I assumed we were boned but spoiler alert we werent.I just told my team to head for the power node trap up and wait for Goliath.....a fully armored full HP goliath. We ended up taking him down. We lead him through trap after trap. His armor was gone almost right away. We got downed a few times but hanks cloak and barrage made it very challenging for the monster to finish off anyone.Me and maggie used any breaks in the monsters assault to retrap the area for a few seconds. That meant sacrificing val or hank but as soon as they were downed we drew his attention and he came running through the minefield again.I may be jumping the gun but I tend to agree with OP. Either the turtle team needs to be nerfed or some other objective needs to spawn on the map like Baron from LoL or Roshan from Dota.,EvolveGame,cn192yo,2,t5_2zo6k

2764462,0,t1_cnhvpwi,Well sure but Hank can also deal an insane amount of damage with the orbital barrage its just that his thing is more accuracybased and more of a burst dealio.Also again Cabots damage amp is limited. You wont get more damage out of it if the entire team shoots while hes amping itll just go on cooldown faster. The monster will still just take an extra  damage as a result of the amp  or whatever the exact number is . Buckets turrets never stop shooting he can throw down as many as he wants pretty rapidly and he can easily switch between his rockets and turret redeployment to constantly be dealing damage. The only way to be sure would be to get do some testing and see which one would actually be more damaging but until then Im vehement in believing that the turrets that constantly deal damage and target weakspots backed up by rockets will be more damaging than the Xamountofdamage amp. ,EvolveGame,cnib43l,1,t5_2zo6k

2863432,0,t3_2svpwp,The reason why real serious competitive games like League of Legends are so successful are beyond just having a great game. Its because LoL isnt pay to win or even pay to enjoy. Evolve is a great game much potential to be a serious competitive game but their money grabbing approach however is going to be its downfall. You can make us pay to have new monsterclasses but let us be able to unlock them without paying as well. Even TF gives random drops so you can get items without paying for them. But Evolve is trying to make these things strictly pay to play. I read one the devs talk about their model and approach and he defended it by saying that others will still be able to experience the content so long as other have opted to drop the dimes to get it. However experiencing the content is not the same as playing the content. I cant help but feel as the OP in that Evolve seems to be money grabbing here. I also dont think its the Devs but their new owners. The devs probably see a game with potential fresh fun competitive ideas while the owners just see the potential to rake in money. Ill probably still end up preordering the basic and hope for the best but if they anticipate getting more money from me after that to make THEIR game last longer then its shelf life then no.  Also the game lobby system is buggy and constant crashing. Im a bit skeptical if theyll have all that fixed in a month. Im sure will see patches on launch day if not week.,EvolveGame,cntknlz,-2,t5_2zo6k

2869215,0,t3_2sy0b3,Played alone for the whole time because my steam friends didnt had it or their PC was too shitty to run it... So I played mostly monster. I think Im th best monster right now it feels kinda good to be honest. Just winning as a monster feels good its fun. Wrecking people who think they can take you at stage  is even more fun. I lost twice as a monster Once on my nd or rd game another when I entered a game already running with Leviathan running with one quarter HP or something... I wrecked their team even if it was the first time I was playing him but the support was still there denying me the reactor destruction. I fucked up I lost.Now Im on a winning streak. Something like  games? I dont know Evolve is closed right now.So yeah I had a great deal of fun. Now the preorder... I keep it because I just enjoy the game and nobody will tell me dont preorder because I already placed the money and I wont have it after the th of February if I cancel it.

2869231,0,t3_2syo4c,Yes.  You should be doing this all the time.While the end game of the monster is to hit level  and full armor the best way to do this even against skilled hunters is to engage when you have armor and a perk.  Youve got a decent chance of getting a small objective a dead hunter or a few knockdowns so that the bigger fights will be easier later and you can sometimes wipe the whole party if something goes wrong for them.  You just need to get out after your armor goes before the hunters do enough damage to your health to slow you and prevent your Evolve from healing it back.  If you do it right then when the buff expires youll have no armor be hard to see and be ready to Evolve which loses your armor anyways.And while people may complain if you do wreck them this way this is a healthy gameplay pattern.  The monster isnt evenly matched with the hunters at level  but he is always a threat under the right circumstances so there is tension and rising and falling action throughout the game.  You and the hunters will have more fun if you have at least three skirmishes over the course of a game and if youre good enough to beat them off of just a buff and a good pick you should do so. ,EvolveGame,cnu8dnq,1,t5_2zo6k

2873008,0,t3_2symtp,I agree with just about everything. Evolve does everything possible to give the advantage to the monster and disadvantages to the hunters. Everything from character movement map colors wildlife even perks are in the monsters favor. Just to state I have  hours into the beta and I still love the game and have already preordered. Well worth the money for a great game though I do have some issues.The real problem with the balance of monster vs hunter is that the learning curve for the monster is so low plus he is alone while the learning curve for the hunters is incredibly high and there are  of them which increases the chances that the hunter team will mess up.As a hunter you need to conserve and use jetpack correctly in order to keep up with a very fast monster look for monster tracks look at the map carefully for a sneaking monster that blends into the background Watch out for your teammates who may find the monster before you or get attacked by wildlife yet split up enough to cover an area so you can even find the monster and thats all while dodging wildlife that will take  your hp if not kill you outright.While as a monster all you need to worry about is keeping ahead of the hunters and staying out of sight. And even if a monster is caught they still have the very good option of hiding in the dome until it runs out. Not to mention that the game punishes hunters for making a mistake much harder than a monster for making a mistake. If even  hunter dies theres a  timer where the hunter team is pretty much useless AND the hunters take a max hp penalty. And all while the monster can run off and easily reach level  Then come back to fight a weakened hunter team. On the flip side if a monster makes a mistake and gets caught in the dome when they dont want a fight its pretty trivial to simply hide in the dome until it goes down then run.Im not saying its impossible for a hunter team to win. What Im saying is that the hunter team has to play absolutely perfectly because if even  person messes up a tiny bit its a massive hit to the team. While the monster can easily recover from a mistake and that nearly every mechanic in the game helps the monster while harming the hunters. ,EvolveGame,cnunu2w,1,t5_2zo6k

Ive gotten so many Stage  wins by incapping someone then spamming lightening strikevortexesmines at the incapped person and his wouldberescuer. Dont even think about going in for a Revive until hes grounded  youre much better off chasing him with damage. The exception here is if you have Hank  you can use the shield projector to go in for a revive or bombard the body and hope its in a more convienent spot.Finally Jetpack Fuel against Kraken.

2964072,0,t1_co3fqnr,Reiterating the other posts I say this because while you should be using Lightning gun for its entire charge as often as you can Markovs Mines are just as important and probably the most powerful secondary item any of the three Assaults have.They wreck the monster.  A mine isnt just a incidental damage the monster might step on.Mines can set up a defensive position.  Did you know the mine will block a rock throw? It will knock you back but not taking damage is worth it.  Is the monster camping a corpse? Drop mines on your buddy that damage will rack up faster than your lightning gun if the monster doesnt GTFO.  Heck just drop mines on a buddy anyway and let someone else revive them if possible.  This is also how you should use Hydes Grenades.Do you have two path choices? minegrenade the path you cant take.  Smart monsters will try and juke you or double back.  Ive had a match where I threw a grenade into a cave then followed the team up another path because the monster was taking damage and I asked who was shooting it.  When the team responded no one I realized I had nailed the monster with my grenade.  The overall point is that its too easy for new players to think the other parts of their kit are incidental tools that might be cool to use rather than fully thought out parts of that character with specific and intentional uses.If anyone ever asks why dont we have grenades like every other shooter the answer is that some people do but the devs gave you something else they considered just as useful instead.,EvolveGame,co513k7,1,t5_2zo6k

3098734,0,t3_2vkk0d,the recolor for the skins were a bit weak but I can see were the devs are coming from. If they give the Goliath magma cracks on his spikes then he will be easier to see than the normal or recolor skins. Even though t may be jut slightly they skinned character will be at a disadvantage. Even f they made te magma glow only effected when the armor was higher the visual representation would change and cause some players to miss the monster. Sure those arguments are a little weak but they are probably what went through the devs minds when they looked at the issue. As a dev I would rather deal with the these skins are pointless argument rather than the my skin makes it easier for the enemy team argument. One is purely a taste complaint while the other can effect balance.Both of these things aside it is only the second day of the games release. The recolor a are the quick and dirty skins. The stuff that actually changes how the monster appears may be in the works and come along with the Goliath when he is released.As for hunter recolors I am fine with this as well I am not a huge fan of the silly skins present in league of legends or smite or dota. In evolve it would mess with the immersion if hanks walking around in a silk bathrobe I call it Hank Hephner goes with the bunny suit Val skin play boy package for . or your regional equivalent!!! fighting monsters and immersion is something the devs worked pretty hard to get rightPersonally I may buy the bog monster kraken. The skin is a little more varied than the others and for . its not a huge hit on my wallet. A similar skin in league of legends takes at least a . or more comitent for the lp and then then skin purchase so at lest they arnt having you buy monster bucks or daisy turds or whatever fake currency name you come up with in your own time.

Most of my early  PC gaming years i spent with blizzard who fully supported there games without DLC and the off games i did buy outside of blizzard never had DLC either and came complete on ship with maybe a couple patches to fix any big issues but thats about it Maybe an expansion down the road but yeah. The DLC trend is still relatively new I suspect that like myself altho not in this situation paying for DLC is a turn off and just seems greedy to the older generations that grew up gaming when it wasnt really a thing. But i could be wrong.Nowadays it seems like theres micro transactions or DLC or some other form of revenue companies make from every game out there on the market now I think if done right like the current situation skins and aestetics and nothing drastically unfair or game changing in game then theres room for it but each game and each format is a different situation i guess.

This games replayability however is not in unlocking content but the nuance of the gameplay and challenging yourself against new people and combinations of enemies maps and perks. If that isnt for you that is just fine but this game has an incredible amount of depth that even the diehards havent fully grasped yet. After all it has only been out for  days so far.Personally Ill pick an intense cat and mouse challenge over yelling at a bunch of bugs in the same raid I did  times last week and the week before that and the week before that...Edit Monster Hunter?

Maybe if you like support and a new support comes out that seems awesome you might consider it. But really you arent missing anything by not buying DLC you dont want.With the gameplay requiring you to know what your teammates can and cant do them buying the DLC means you play your existing character different when you play next to them.

3136279,0,t1_comn0qe,I was fortunate enough last night to hit stage three Max armor and Max health. I wiped the hunters at the relay I had to destroy and the remaining trapper was uncatchable. I believe it was Maggie as she kept shooting hooks in the ground that would snare me each time I got close to her and shed put more distance from me. I gave up after  seconds of this and doubled back to the relay and got it to  hp. They had all re spawned by this time and I beat on that thing for the remainder of my shield and  of my health the thing never moved from  and then gave up and tried to wipe then again and died.  So to clarify I had full armor and health when the hunters showed up and the machine was at  health. I say  because it couldnt be any lower it could have been  idk.

3137640,0,t1_con798i,And since thats standard operating procedure for hunters any monster with any sense could just turn around sporadically because worst case scenario he runs into two people who cant stop him or refresh the tracker on him and he goes on his merry way maybe a little wear and tear on the armor to show for it but thats not a big deal. Just like the hunters can easily catch the monster once they know what hes doing the monster can easily escape because hunters behave so predictably when they think theyre springing a trap. Or since monsters are faster at crossing the terrain than hunters all he has to do is keep moving and the hunters will never catch up to him to get on either side of him.Any super overpowered advantage you think the hunters get by knowing where the monster is the monster gets those same advantages by knowing he can be seen.

However I still get this perk because it increases my survivability damage utility and is awesome. If you are gonna downvote back it up with proof because I guarantee you that perk does not effect the heal burst.Edit Ok so apparently its a bug that I wasnt aware of. It was very clearly stated that class abilities were not effected by the perk. In alpha and beta the perk did not.

3180825,0,t3_2wke2q,For support Bucket is definitely the weakest. Hank can do some really clutch plays with his Shield and Orbital Barrage while Cabot has insane damage potential range and tracking ability. Buckets UAV is sometimes useful but most of the time puts the player in a bad place and forces the hunters to fight with . His turrets do ok damage not nearly as good as Cabot but are so easy to avoiddestroy. Depending on the team compositionmonster Cabot can be better than Hank but both are good and bring a lot to the team.At higher levels I get the feeling that Maggie becomes more and more useless. A decent hunter team will find trackscorpses or the monster will trigger birds and from there on Daisy is totally useless for tracking. Abe is just better than Maggie and Griffin imo with his OP darts and stasis grenades his shotgun is pretty good aswell. The other  classes are covered by uROOTminigun and I totally agree with what he said. Of course for most this game is casual and you shouldnt expect anyone to be try hard in pub lobbies but some characters are just worse than their other options.edit missed a word.,EvolveGame,corowj6,3,t5_2zo6k

My complaints come when a stage  with full armor tries to dome run us gets no incaps escapes with  bars of health and doesnt attack us at all. The running until stage  thing really only works at low tiers and at midhigh it results in a long term lose for the monster. Some of those matches last night would have been monster wins if they prioritized fighting over running.We do like to poke a bit of fun at people so dont take it as salt.

Doesent happen alot.In a team that knows how to play and how to evade a monster buckets awesome damage eats its health away.Many games ive played as hank and while we hold the defense quite long in the end the monster wins with  bars health.Believe me he woudent have won with Buckets damage on him.On any general game Bucket pumps out k too k dmg.I get k damage from sentry guns and just another k from missles.Now compare that to hank or Cabot?

3246579,0,t3_2xavvr,I think that Laz needs to be fundamentally changed. He might not be better than Caira but Caira isnt infuriating to play against. I dont even play the monster online because playing against Laz is so not fun. Its not worth it to queue and have a  chance of having a Laz in my game. I think that the hunter should be based on stealth healing still but the way that he knocks downpoints off is totally game breaking. That is a core game mechanic for the monster to take advantage of completely removed from play. It also makes the already hunter advantageous earlymid game even more hunter advantageous. This would be like taking the grey off your teammate in LD. It would break the game and make it super survivor favored. If you down someone in the early game because you caught them off guard or outplayed them during a dome it doesnt matter. It doesnt help you in the late game because those penalties dont stay. Instead Laz should have some sort of way to heal over the down penalties or something. This is the part where I possibly look stupid cause Im not sure this is how the game works. I think that when you get down penalties you lose a small amount of your max health right? What if when Laz revived you he healed you back to full no matter how many down penalties you have. That way the down penalty mechanic doesnt get totally removed and Laz still is powerful at stealth revives and keeping his team alive. I lose against Laz cause no one has down penalties and hence a ton of health too. But if they just had a ton of health they would still be more dangerous to the monster than normal but still have down penalties. That way if you can outplay them still. But ive lost to hunter teams that totally suck but since they had a Laz they were just unkillable. ,EvolveGame,coyila9,1,t5_2zo6k

3307522,0,t3_2xxsnh,You can look at this situation in game theory as a noncooperative game which means there is at least one Nash equilibrium. If monster onlyhunter only is an option then the equlibrium will be that everyone will choose those options rather than being flexible this is because things will rapidly converge to the point where if you DONT pick the popular side you will ALWAYS get put as the unpopular side. aside in this context the unpopular side is the one that falls short of its target which is  for hunters  for monster. so if  want monster it is popular gt but if  want hunter hunter is still unpopular lt.So anyway this system will result in no one being willing to play fill even people who dont mind mixing it up because fill will become just another way to say upopular side. So then it comes down to the mix. if there is a perfect  mix then no big deal. I am doubtful that this well be the case very often. When it is not the case we would be seeing some unacceptable wait times on the order of probably at least  minutes for the popular side between matches even if the balance isnt that far off. And the number of complaints of people getting stuck as a role they dont like seems to indicate that the balance is a fair bit off atm. I would guess that m waits would not be uncommon.Admittedly this situation is fine for people who prefer the unpopular side but it sucks for everyone else. and even if you do prefer unpopular side this result should not much if any better than the GOOD Nash equilibrium which is what should result from the more cooperative arrangement where the system does its best to give you your preferred role.,EvolveGame,cp5a9bs,1,t5_2zo6k

3342563,0,t3_2yg9s3,I think some areas are unbalanced the patch notes theyre working with basically sum it all up. Wraith moves too fast Hyde stinks Cabots railgun is too strong Vals healing is bad Griffins sound spikes can be useless and arc mines are too strong. The balance is good but certain hunters are just blatant bad choices. Were seeing some very large potential balance changes with the next patch to me thats a sign of a game thats unbalanced. Cabots railgun for instance is having its DPS lowered by nearly . Thats a huge change and just shows how OP he currently is. With that said... I love the game and feel thats its pretty well done but balance is something that needs a lot of work.

3430969,0,t1_cpiomaq,Yah. Are you looking for general tips or you wanna play? As for general medic tips unlock Caira. Haha she really is the best medic although Val is fun to play but I personally think requires much higher skill to play well. CrimsonBZD looks like he gave some great tips too. With Val you generally wanna immediately get the high ground in  fight. Get up to a cliff remember your medgun has a m range. Is no one hurt bad? Consider using your tranq and putting a couple sniper rifle targets on the monster. Thats x damage of your teammates hit them and they last a bit bonus if they are headshots. Try to keep line of sight with your teammates otherwise the medgun doesnt work. Hopping into combat to fire off healing bursts can really frustrate the monster too but they are vals only way of healing so save them for yourself if necessary. Immediately as the dome goes down think tranqs. Not only do they massively slow the monster they light him Up for the entire team to see. Keep that bad boy tranqed for a while and he isnt escaping anytime soon. Anther Val thing incapped teammates. Your medgun has the potential to bring back downed teammates from its max range. As soon as you see someone go down hit then with the medgun. If the monster sits there focusing them hopefully the rest of your team will continue pummeling him and you can either hugely delay your teammates death or bring him back. Sorry that was kind of a long post I got thinking about things Ive learned with Val   let me know if you want more tips or want to play. Maybe start a new post on here too Im definitely no expert.

3478192,0,t1_cpogbgr,That would work and excellently if monster traversals were equally affected by these things.However if it were as you described it Abe would be immediately worthless and Maggie would be close to it considering her main utility is to follow the monsters footprints.Maggie would still be able to effectively dome the monster however she would need to more or less guess or otherwise outright ignore Daisy in order to lay a harpoon trap pool where the monster will be in order to get the dome.However I dont think the game is balanced around this. I think thus far monster players have gotten off easily I know I have because with the way it works now the trapper has to perform at a degree much greater than the other members.Furthermore I think that if you have a scenario with an S monster with full health and armor facing a team of Hunters with no strikes still means the monster wins outright assuming a perfect world where everyone plays their roles to the best of their abilities.If that is the case then it would follow that the monster is not supposed to be at full HP at S by simply avoiding domes but instead engaging with the hunters and managing to at least leave the dome without HP damage.,EvolveGame,cpoqmmp,1,t5_2zo6k
3478621,1,t3_3032t1,I feel like the reason they are doing this is because they are not making money off of the new maps and game modes. I am a game design major and I can tell you it is not cheap to make a game. From what they have said about it before its release they want to keep the community together. The higher price might be their way of continuing the games development. The good thing is that these new hunters and the behemoth are not required to play. You can play with people who have them. I like to look at League of Legends as an example. The game is free and the way you support the developers is by buying skins. The skins dont do anything really. They are purely cosmetic and have no real effect on gameplay but they still cost about  with the most expensive being . I dont feel like they are forcing anyone to buy them. If you like the game and want to get some cool new characters go ahead and buy them. If you feel like it is a waste of money than just keep playing the game because you arent really losing anything from not buying them.,EvolveGame,cpose49,-2,t5_2zo6k

3484264,0,t1_cppegme,I think they wanted to encourage less spamming of the mines like grenades  this should give the monster player a little time to react to them but isnt a high number nerf.  I believe Markov was winning close fights by running directly away from the monster and tossing mines on the ground as he ran making it impossible for the monster to interact with him without taking damage.Actually come to think of it I know the exact abuse case scenario.  Want to see some cheese? Heres some cheese This is from the tournament last weekend my first ever as the monster.  Ive got a good idea of how to beat it now but good god was it obnoxious to learn about there.

3554803,0,t1_cpx1125,I will preface this by saying that I am not really bothered by this bug. Its no big deal really.This is not how software testing works though. A developer on this scale would be utilizing unit tests that should take an input variable hitbox activation by specific damage source for example and test in code the expected output health loss by monster. It doesnt require playing the monster or being good. They should easily notice this discrepancy if this x damage thing is confirmed. I havent seen any official announcement though. Edit bug apparently confirmed on dev stream.,EvolveGame,cpxgzfn,1,t5_2zo6k

He is just so full of quality of life type of features. Want to heal a teammate who is far ahead of you or ran off? No need to rush there just send the drone in. It has infinite distance it revives you can target teammates through walls it stays up and follows a teammate even if you die. Your main damage dealing weapon doubles as your utility tool reducing your healing burst cooldown no need to frantically switch between items in battle. Your healing burst also has the largest radius of all medics no need to put yourself in harms way. Your other utility tool is a simple grenade launcher with no funky mechanics just lob the grenade and put it away.

Thats exactly what they need to change to make him stop taking x damage from all attacks. The rock wall bugs yea I can get that. Thats probably harder to fix. But behemoth having a permanent double damage bug is not only something that shouldnt have made it into the final product its something that shouldnt be that difficult to fix.Balance patches taking a while I get they have to make changes see if they work tweak them etc. This isnt balancing something this is making a monster take normal damage like all the other monsters. ,EvolveGame,cpxxxiu,-2,t5_2zo6k

3637430,0,t3_320vrm,Ideally in a balanced game different hunters are best in different scenarios.  If one hunter shines above all others its typically because the game hasnt established that sense of situational balance as efficiently as it could.In the instance of Support Sunny is currently reigning supreme for a number of reasons.  Her damage mitigation is twice as effective as Hanks firstly because her shielding is automated and secondly because her jetpack boosting requires less precision and timing than Hanks shield projector.  Right now shes effectively a Hank . which is something you generally want to avoid when designing new playable characters.Sadly TRS did it twice in one launch.  Torvald is basically a better Parnell with a more reliable shotgun a stronger ranged AoE attack and more consistent damage amplification with the steady supply of grenades as opposed to the riskier costlier SS.  At least Hank still has the incredibly situational but highly worthwhile Orbital Barrage.  Parnell does literally nothing Torvald cant do better.,EvolveGame,cq6w7f1,2,t5_2zo6k

However with Sunny that is not even necessary. At this point I dont think there is any Monster that can get away from a Sunny  Trapper dome except Behemoth near caves.As for combat lets say you take Torvald The Stasis Gun makes it easier to connect all Mortars because once the Monster uses his last traversal point he will be slowed enough to get all hits off. For Markov outside of traversal movement the Monster will almost always be in Lightning Gun range with the Stasis on him. Griffin is solid dont get me wrong but I do not think he is the best for this composition. Only thing I see him doing better is keeping Caira alive. With Markov the mines do a better job.,EvolveGame,cq8jb5l,1,t5_2zo6k

3668131,1,t3_32disa,The shooting gives them more stamina thing is pretty overblown.  You have to be pretty close about dome radius before it actually puts the monster into combat mode.The monster is rarely gaining anything at all from longrange shooting.  The bigger problem is that its you know shooting the monster and giving them immediate feedback without needing to look back that they still havent broken contact.  Holding fire during a chase isnt about stamina and holding fire with tranqsstasis which dont cause combat mode is still a good idea its about not giving the monster free data.Further chasing a monster while keeping them in sustained combat mode isnt necessarily a bad thing either.  It also stops armor amp health regen.,EvolveGame,cqae43j,2,t5_2zo6k

And Griffen can easily clear the entire board of the monster tokens while turning them into the bullet tokens combine this with Cabots damage amp which also is his level two can clear entire rounds quickly.TLDR I like Hyde and Cabot because they can use their level  much more and are better than some level s and Griffens sound spikes are really useful for clearing the entire board.,EvolveGame,cqfjsqm,3,t5_2zo6k

3747076,0,t1_cqj9438,Id actually say its that her shield drone isnt area denial its just a better shield than Hanks. Yeah they both have their pros and cons but Sunnys shield drone a works for her too which is huge and b works while shes doing other things. Neither jetpack booster nor shield is really an area denial tool theyre just two incredible defensive tools to save hunters from monster focus. Add on her jetpack and she has something no other hunter has  gadgets to keep her team safe.,EvolveGame,cqje4hd,2,t5_2zo6k

This exploit would be far more serious if it constantly tacked to the crit spot.Also how does a skillful player at an fps not have the ability to shoot the crit spot more accurately? If I just said and good fps player can deal more dps sure youd be in the right.

Almost any combination of skills is fine on Goliath as long as you take at least one point in Leap Smash for mobility.  Charge is for CC Fire Breath for cloak and destructible objects Leap Smash for clearing cluttered up hunters turrets and shield drones quickly and Rock Throw for killing fools.

He cant use traversals to catch up his walking speed is messed up because hes bumping into the relay and his abilities are all being blocked by the relay as well. Then imagine all that with a Maggie dropping harpoons as she runs.All hes got is the hope that the dropship is far enough away to kill them with fire breath or that the hunter is stupid enough that walking the other way will get them.

3899623,0,t1_cr0qymw,gt You can absolutely do that. I do it all the time on PC just boost straight up and rain heals from the sky. Why on earth would you think Caira wouldnt be able to use her jetpack while shooting?You missunderstood me on that I didnt mean Caira to be the one in air but the other guy being focused. Trapper for example.gt Distance doesnt affect Cairas healing rate. She fires the same grenades at the same rate at any distance and while flight time introduces a slight delay into the start of the heal it also introduces a slight delay into the stop when she goes to reload keeping her healing speed the same.It does not affect the hps directly what I mean is if for example Val starts healing at max range m and Caira shots at the same time the time the Grenade flies is the time Val gets ahead. To be honest I do not know though how long that is It could be . s which would have nearly no factor or . sgt So all these fudged numbers the fact that your math only takes one persons reload into account the fact that you ignore how Caira gets disproportionately boosted by perks all leading to an analysis that just barely manages to draw the conclusion that the two are equal tells you that Val is a better singletarget healer?I only took Caira with Perk for a reason so I could compare it to Val without perks. I calculated you out how much healing Caira gets with CapacityReload if my math is wrong there feel free to tell me. Its kinda late here already so maybe Ive made a mistake.It leads me to the conclusion that mathematically if both of them hit  with no perks they are Equal. And this leads me to the point of bringing the game in with Situations that we both listed up that we think X benefits more than Y. And through those I think Val has a better shot.,EvolveGame,cr0shml,2,t5_2zo6k

4049332,0,t3_36wnfj,I mentioned this in the other thread but theres an achievement for reaching Stage . Which means theres probably a Stage  as well. So I was thinking the difference between this mode and Hunt might be no perks or buffs. I believe TRS has mentioned interest in a no perksbuffs gametype as well. Then with a possible best of  this would be exactly the kind of gamemode theyd add to a Ranked mode. Another idea I had more in line with an Arena mode is that the monster no longer fills its evolve meter by eating. It can only do so through combat. So theres no fleetil and the monster is forced into constant engagement in order to level up. But they would probably do something with the dome for this gamemode because itd be a bit overpowered.

4060843,0,t3_370vv6,Ive been VERY VERY successful with Parnell while using Movement Speed. Keeping a close distance monster keeps them on tilt stops feeding and when they evolve you can always get  magazines of your shotgun into them for x damage x if you shoot for the head. This takes out . bars of health usually you can get another . to  by shooting them afterwards. Additionally MS helps you juke the monster if it comes to that.Use your rockets A LOT. Against the Wraith in the air the rockets do much more damage. Its also great for hitting people around corners. Dont underestimate its power.Use SS early in the dome so you can use it again in the last  seconds.Dont be afraid to use SS while chasing to gain some distance on the monster.Another tip when low on health and you want to use SS use your shield BEFORE pressing SS. Ive learned that the hard way.,EvolveGame,crj5zi9,2,t5_2zo6k

4080878,0,t3_37cchw,For those at workThe short version The Monster and the Hunter squad all get dropped into a dome. No escape no excuses  this aint over until someone goes down! The new Arena Mode places five fixed domes on each of the  maps in Evolve. For those not up on your math thats  lockeddown venues ready for brawling. At the start you select a map then youre in for a bestofthree series of hardcore firefights. The Monster and Hunters are locked in that dome until one side is eliminated. After that match you immediately jump to another dome on the same map for round two  that continues until theres a victor.All the Hunters and Monster begin each match with one perk. Monsters start at Stage  with  percent armor but can feed on wildlife in battle to regain armor and even evolve to Stage . Though the size of the mobile arena makes this a tough task. The dome isnt coming down. So for all you Trappers out there your job got a little easier. There is no dropship timer. Once a Hunter dies in battle they have to sit it out until the next fight. Players cant change their character or perk selection between rounds but Monster players can change their abilities.Obviously if youre looking to get competitive with Evolve something like an Arena Mode is going to be awesome to play  or watch. Thats just a taste of things to come.,EvolveGame,crlg23o,34,t5_2zo6k

4633222,0,t1_ctehm57,i mean you pretty much admit in your opening paragraph that you are somewhat of a special case. The preference system isnt great for people like you but its good for the game in general. I will say that as any hunter but especially as trapper youre basically handicapping yourself by not becoming intimately familiar with monster play. Know your enemy!I dont think buying something without either learning how it works or being willing to adapt to its idiosyncrasies is particularly reasonable myself. Basically everything about the preference system makes perfect sense its only an issue with people who are exceptionally rigid putting a role as  generally guarantees youll get that role more often than not over reasonable intervals so really its only those completely unwilling to be anything other than their favorite that have real problems.Ive heard this argument that having the option to wait for their favorite role however long that takes would keep them in the game and every time i roll my eyes. Thats just not believable that most people would be willing to put up with  minute waits you might power through for a few weeks but eventually youd be tired of that and just quit anyway. Giving that option would just mess up the system and not actually retain players IMO.,EvolveGame,ctel4ss,0,t5_2zo6k

4740044,0,t1_ctrwe0d,The reasons those types of posts are downvoted is because Kraken though strong doesnt appear to be as crazy OP as some posts seem to assert when hes faced with Hunters that are actually good. In most  circumstances Kraken complaints are founded on experiences with bad or uncoordinated teams. Right now his most dependable and powerful ability is Aftershock but thats basically the only thing that worries good teams  and teams have found decent ways to deal with it.Lightning Strike is an easy dodge if you have  bars of jet fuel. As in if you have  bars and it hits you its your fault. Mines are easily mitigated with a dedicated mine clearer. Vortex is super hard to dodge at close range but can be outhealed. Aftershock is whats left and it is what it is.If you have Hank or Sunny the respective player has to keep an eye out for AS when its off cooldown and save shields and booster for it. If you have a Griffin you should always look to be behind Kraken or at least on the opposite direction of Support or Medic whoever he is focusing. That way when he goes for the Aftershock bomb you can stop his forward progress with a harpoon and the target can dodge it easily. AS is played around on the assumption that it will hit one target.

Running and sneaking should be applied where it is needed. A Laz team has one weakness they cant keep the trapper up. Use this to your advantage by focusing the trapper and incapacitate them to run away and find a more favorable location to fight.   DONT CAMP BODIES IN EARLY STAGES UNLESS ITS LAZ BODY and you have enough health to take out the whole team. You shouldnt fight if you dont want to but if you do. Do so near Wildlife and try your best to get into the areas with water. If you can incapacitate a hunter in deep water you can force Laz to revive early or risk losing the body in the water. Laz can revive bodies if he cant walk on the water. Get abilities that help reveal cloaks and also handle the turrets bucket puts out. When you are ready to fight the best you can do is to first go after Bucket  taking down Bucket means you wont lose Laz later if you to finish him off. Plus side the only damage should now come from the assault.  take out bucket go after Laz. If Laz cloaks just wait and go near the body while also doing damage to assault.  once Laz s cloaks go out you are free to kill him unless the trapper can pull something up his ass.  Attack near the body dont stand directly on the body funny hit boxes will cause Laz to revive  in between your melees.,EvolveGame,cw7fmaj,2,t5_2zo6k

8237015,0,t1_d575889,If its true that you competed in esl and played over  hours then I respect your opinion on this. I used to play Vs FAV and his clan who played there and used to have really good games with them I thought they won it but cant remember ne way doesnt matter.... i do think that all the things combined make monster really really strong and not sure I agree about everyoine can do damage now because if they do the dome just drops which I feel is really strange. The armour regen is the big one for me and I do think that the monster perks outweigh the hunter ones in terms of strength. With all perks fully upgraded it is the strongest the monster has ever been in terms of passive buffs like armour regne damage  feeding speed etc. I need to level to play rranked to really see how the meta has changed and maybe its becuase I am being matched againast new players but never seen the monster having so much going for him. I know the hunters could never catch him in a straight line but with the choke points removed it does feel easier to do circle around the map. I am eager to play a good team and tbh i really hope i am wrong but all these changes seemed to have buffed the monster and alot of the hunter changes dont seem very strong. I break through the supports shiled with ease and with like  cooldown reduction I feeling so strong. I would love to be wrong tbh as I really want the game to succeed I am just feeling like I shouldnt be able to win stage  so easlily with or without new players all the perks buffs and gamesplay changes feel so strong to me. ,EvolveGame,d576kxn,1,t5_2zo6k

I guarantee no Griffin player will tell you his sound traps are his main weapon.Like I said. You havent played against a good Griffin. This is blatantly obvious.Edit I see you completely re edited your post.gtGriffins harpoon is okay but it doesnt keep a monster close after the dome goes down.That is precisely what it does. A good Griffin player is aware that the dome is about to go down and is positioned accordingly. You will get a couple of harpoons into the monster. Letting everyone else DPS.

8249016,0,t3_4sca5q,The game was always  Monster vs  Hunters. Yes the Monster player always spawned beneath the Ship this does not mean you get trapped instantly. If you do youre just playing against first timers.The Trapper used to be the only one who could cast the Dome over the Monster and on top of that the Dome used to have a projectile that you throw out and it had travel time to it. After the travel time to the projectile was over you had the Dome slowly come down it started forming from the highest point and then slowly descended downwards until the Dome was complete. The Dome also had a distinctive sound to it when it was cast by the Trapper. This meant that a bad Trapper would mean you will never get to fight the Monster until hes Stage . Also some Monsters like the Wraith could burn all  stamina bars to leap out of the Dome before it was fully deployed. None of this is relevant any longer because now all  Hunters can deploy the Dome and its instant so theres  counterplay to it from the Monster players side.The reason why you never reach Stage  is not because you spawn under the Ship. This has nothing to do with it you have  options when you start the game. You either dont care about your footprints and get as much distance as possible to the dropship and head for the best feeding route most effective method or you can walk a certain direction for a couple of seconds to leave footprints then sneak and turn back and head another way this sometimes leads the Hunters to the opposite direction of you because they follow your footprints when in reality you sneaked another way most effective in pubs but still inferior to the first method.The real reason you cant get to Stage  is because of the Planet Scanner. Turtle Rock added a  second CD hand held mechanic to the game that shows where the Monster is located every  seconds because of bad players. Planet Scanner is the reason why sneaking is  pointless in the game now footprints dont matter at all and the whole sneak gameplay is gone.The reason why this game is so hard to balance is because how different it is in pub play vs competitive play. In competitive play Hunters were always more likely to win than the Monster but in pub play its the other way around. Lots of people complained about the Monster just sneaking until Stage  this was especially true for the Wraith and the Hunters would never be able to find the Monster and fight them. Some pub Hunter teams just straight up went to the Relay and just sat there until the Monster reached Stage  and came there because the Hunters didnt want to chase him for  minutes. How dumb is that? Pub Hunters basically gave the Monster free Stage  because they were unable to track him and trap him properly then complained in this same sub reddit.When youre facing competitive players who know the best feeding routes and where each buff spawns they already know where the Monster is going to be heading a good  of the time. They will go and lock down the best part of the map the part that has the best feeding route or the best buff spawn. If the Monster is not in that direction the Hunters will claim a free buff and know exactly where the Monster is from there. A good Hunter team can completely lock down  of the map by properly spreading out to key locations and chokepoints when you play vs a good Hunter team you get a feeling that youre trapped no matter where you go and youll never have time to feed its a real pain. However this is only true in very high level competitive games  of this game is pub play and the Monster always has the upper hand there against uncoordinated teams thats why the game is so hard to balance because  of the Hunter teams in the game are not skilled and coordinated enough to play the game properly.. But its the majority of the population so you sort of have to cater to them at least a little bit balancing wise rather than just focus on the top  players who know how to play the game properly.The Planet Scanner is the biggest bad decision Turtle Rock put into the game. Sneaking is pointless now. They probably tried to alleviate this by adding armor regeneration to the Monster this was not in the first iteration of Evolve either which I really dont like at all personally.

Please teach me how even if hes trapped by harpon or whatever you just have to destroy it and run you wont take heavy damagesgt If they didnt nerf dome then the planetary scanner would be more OP than it already is.Something also need to be done for the scan i suggest increased cooldown and trapper should be able to see the monstergt If they left dome the way it was then the trapper would be the only one with it.Id rather have  usefull dome than a weak shared dome,EvolveGame,d59qeii,0,t5_2zo6k

What I run most of the time Regen Rocket Lord and Bohrium Batteryjetpack recharge.,EvolveGame,d5jxk4j,2,t5_2zo6k
8339158,0,t3_4tspz8,All hunters have a little passive regen outside of combat now. And regen works only when you havent taken damage for a few seconds so you wont be regeneration while being attacked. So  regen perks is a bit of a waste.Val has the highest single target healing real good to get a monster off a teammate their focusing on usually support. Rogue Val has less single target healing but better aoe healing. Her heal burst is unique in how it applies a constant  meter dot heal on teammates while not on cooldown and when used will heal only her by as much as  of her hp maybe more. Val is less about damage and more about utility with her tranq with  second  slow a good Val will attempt to keep the monster under constant tranquil. And her rifle applies a weak spot which increases damage when shot at it by a decent amount. Rogue Val has passive healing on allies so she doesnt have to focus as much on her teammates and can deal more damage. Her rifle does not open monsters up to weak spots and deals less damage but has  rounds per magazine and can dish decent ish damage. Her poison dart doeant slow but still applies the global green tint to see monsters through walls as well as apply a nasty poison dot which helps keep armor from regenerating and can deal good home damage. I can heal more with Val personally and apply good pressure on the monster with a constant slow but with Rogue Val I have been able too deal as high as k damage with her and average k. ,EvolveGame,d5jy69y,1,t5_2zo6k

8375367,0,t1_d5o1ysb,Completely depends on your personal preference. Im  sure the monster role is the least preferenced role in the game besides possibly trapper. So if either of those two are your favorite roles then you have a better chance to always get to pick those.Its like picking a supporthealer or tank class in any MMO game. They are always least prefered compared to the damage dealer classes. If those least prefered roles are your choice then you get to have shorter queue times for dungeons.In any case the player gets to choose their role and get to play it. No matter how long the wait. Thats better than playing something you dont even want to play. Player choices matter and being stuck in a single role a whole match long feels more like a punishment if you didnt want to play that particular role in the first place.,EvolveGame,d5ogyje,2,t5_2zo6k

8376923,0,t1_d5oaiu7,Im not OP but I like having Traversal Regen and cooldown perks on Gorgon. Cooldown lets you lay more traps as you evade the hunters slowing them down more. In the dome it lets you acid and web more. Gorgon is kind of stealthy and likes to ambush the hunters and is more ability based than say... Wraith. I usually only autoattack if everything else is on cooldown.Traversal Regen really helps you put some real distance between yourself and the hunters especially at the start of a match Having that one extra web sling up earlier really helps sometimes.,EvolveGame,d5onxtd,1,t5_2zo6k

8525540,0,t1_d6787zp,gt People are going to leave after auto character selection and the lobby is going to fall apart anywayIt seems like the problem with matchmaking is that people act the way you do. Matchmaking is going to match you with the best group it can find based on player skill and class preferences. When you leave and force a lobby to disband the same group of players is going to get kicked back in to the matchmaking pool. If it matched you with  people that prefer the same class then there probably isnt an ideal matchup so the group you just left is probably still the optimal matchup.This isnt a problem with the game code you are criticizing a design decision. Forcing the game to split up the optimal group because one person repeatedly leaves is either going to increase queue times or force it to match less optimal groups that have less variety in class preferences andor more disparity in skill level.,EvolveGame,d67975g,0,t5_2zo6k

8960668,0,t3_52wmof,RAbe  Shotgun and freaking grenades just sit better with me than machine guns rocket launchers flame throwers lightning guns and mines. Although Torvald and Parnell are close second. Kala  I love the concept of a humanmonster experiment gone wrong. Might be a little clich but she is the most unique character in her class and I just enjoy playing her more than the other supports. Sunny is close second because she provides a lot of utility for the team but isnt as interesting as a human crossed with a monster. Maggie  Shes what I imagine the perfect Trapper should have traps harpoon turrets and a beast companion at their side. Crow is close second only because he has a stasis rifle instead of some traplike device. Slim  Hes got a kit thats just right for an insect alien. Organic primary weapon grenades that mess with Monsters senses and a healing drone. Not to mention hes quite challenging and incredibly fun to play. Wraith  Im a very big fan of horror genre and Wraith has the strongest horror vibe. Other Monsters are pretty badass but theyre more like fantasy creatures in my opinion. The way she slithers through the air deceives her prey with her decoy adducts her victims in a matter of seconds and goes all fucking berserk when forced for fight. Shes fast agile and menacing. There might be other monsters that outperform her in any stage but Wraith is going to stand at the top for a long time. Only way to top that is adding a freaking Xenomorph from the Alien franchise. ,EvolveGame,d7oxrp0,2,t5_2zo6k

On the left is  cyborg maggie while on Hydes right is nonmutant looking woman Bowie and a multilimbed mutant Greenman.   Would have liked to see a cyborg Daisy.Hyde himself has a giant swordclub with flame shooting out of  exhaustvents.Is this the crew that manages to take out the possessed kalakali ?The names of some of the characters arent consistent.   Bas Primus in the Outlaws looks like Professor Eugene Bronson of Trappers  rather than Bas Primus.  Billy Smooth of Trappers  looks like he evolved into Yoshirou Sundae.    Warbuckets Misfits feature Domino which looks like the silhouette of Jellybean and GracieVG which looks like the silhouette of GrizzlySon.   A very guardian of the galaxy vibe.  ,EvolveGame,d9eefjg,5,t5_2zo6k
9455080,0,t1_d998j2m,Because Stage  was a patch that got rebranded as Evolve Stage . It was formerly TU Title Update  deserving no more fanfare than Title Updates  before it.It also wasnt Beta despite TRSKs attempts to make it seem so. But some gamers seem to have severe deficit in critical thinking skills or extremely shortterm memory and fell for the misdirection.,EvolveGame,d9ehygn,0,t5_2zo6k

9510697,0,t1_d9kq4hi,gt that Matt and the others posted after they were fired is canon. It is nothing more than speculation on their part on what I have looked into this a little more granted while hungover and I cant find any canon information on the monsters origins and the latter incarnations dont always make sense Electro Griffin is an actor playing griffin in a filmIf you have a link to the source id love to look into it more though,EvolveGame,d9le8pm,1,t5_2zo6k

10150007,0,t1_dbnkf4f,gt It needs to be something where it has a single player campaign.Left  Dead did fine without one. Just focus on coop and make PvP and afterthought.,EvolveGame,dbujqv8,1,t5_2zo6k

11327629,0,t3_61n6qx,To be fair hes supoosed to run lol. Drop buoys find somewhere to put your respawn beacon if someone dies return and use heal burst when you can. Would you rather have him jump in the monsters mouth?Edit also gotta say Abe is one of the weakest trappers. Id say go Jack or better yet Crow.,EvolveGame,dffyus9,17,t5_2zo6k
11354693,0,t3_61s1at,I have no desire to let a determining rank take my role as Medic when I know how to play it and rather not lose. I rather wait a few more minutes than get stuck in a game that sucks because someone doesnt know wtf theyre doing,EvolveGame,dfj17ru,1,t5_2zo6k

11376905,0,t3_61vyvb,Sunny destroys wraith since she pretty much has to burn an ability to destroy the drone. Jack and Griffin can stop warp blast and abduct.Honestly all you need to do is to safe up jet so you can dodge warp blast its that easy. Wraith is one of the weaker monsters once you know what to do.,EvolveGame,dfljxaw,1,t5_2zo6k
