10888606,0,t3_5vlqt0,The github repository has a lot of information on it.I discovered it when I was looking for a platform that already had IO video and storage that I could put my own core on. I bought it for developing a PDP and PDP core on but Ive been distracted since I got it playing games with their available cores. The documentation could be better on certain points but overall its a fun little system.,fpgagaming,de32yyk,3,t5_3j5ob
