4946634,0,t1_cua8hv3,Sorry for late reply  holiday and forgot about Reddit.You make a character by relations between yourself and two fellow players  those sitting to your left and right.  If the person to your left and you share the relation Two scientists investigating something then youre a scientist.  If the person to the right share the relation Father and son on a tourist trip then youre one of those two  perhaps the father.  Now youre going on a tourist trip with your son and have accidentally started to work with a Night Vale scientist as you are a scientist yourself.,welcometonightvale,cui2a94,1,t5_2y2xk
