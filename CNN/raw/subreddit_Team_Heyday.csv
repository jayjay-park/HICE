11793471,0,t3_683gw8,I weigh the same today as I did a week ago. But last week I was up from the previous week so thats better than an upward trend.Ive had a reeeally stressful week. I know I could have done better so Im not trying to excuse it but I also know this week will be a little easier to do better in. Ive still got a shot to come close to my challenge goal even if I cant meet it. more weeks! Lets finish strong guys. ,Team_Heyday,dgwtvq3,3,t5_3jkfu
