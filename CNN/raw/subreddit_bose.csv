7530519,0,t3_4i5ohk,Part of the issue is that the FCC has cleared BT headphones on flights but not all airlines have agreed to that.  Since noise cancellation was built for flights theres been some resistance to Bose building them.  With that said airlines have started relaxing their policies on wireless devices so I bet youll see a pair before this Christmas.Source  Im a consumer electronics expert and work in the field.,bose,d2y6lyw,3,t5_2ykqh

8341397,0,t1_d5jxqes,Interesting i need to research more on the bluetooth spec it seems there was no real speed gain between .edr  mbit and  mbit but can transmit over wifi at mbit im not sure when the wifi speed would actually be available assuming bluetooth just negotiates to use exisiting wifi network if both devices support itAt least it seems bluetooth  will actually be getting a speed bump when its released.Bluetooth  uses less power at the cost of range and other than additional features the speed is the same as .As for your issue you may benefit from another driver i linked one before for the csr chip ill edit this post with it later.,bose,d5k88p3,1,t5_2ykqh

9298132,0,t3_57s4z9,That would be really really nice but Im pessimistic that Bose would implement this after the release of the headphones instead of just releasing a new pair a couple years down the line with it.,bose,d8ulsbk,2,t5_2ykqh
9306610,0,t1_d8v5v27,Yep its a biological leather alternative.  I think they first implemented it with the SoundLink Around Ear II headphones and then the QCs or vice versa whichever one came out first.  It feels and looks like leather but its not true leather in the sense that its cow skin.That being said cleaning is really easy.  I always stuff a microfiber cloth in with my QC and my QC headphones to wipe the pads and outer earcups.  Ill wet one corner if theres gunk on the pads that just isnt coming off.  Im not worried enough to throw a silica gel packet in with mine simply because Bose offers replacement pads and theyll do so for quite a bit of time.  Theyre still offering replacement pads for the QC headphones and those came out ages ago.,bose,d8vohnm,1,t5_2ykqh

9420566,0,t3_59ogk5,I have the same impression bought them on Thursday last week took a  hour flight all was fantastic. Now I have the impression the ANC is weaker. Was looking to confirm this with others too as this might just be my hearing getting used to the ANC and amplifying external sounds which were being silenced at first. Any thoughts?,bose,d9a4e41,1,t5_2ykqh
10051359,0,t1_dbgvico,I took a Solo  home and tested it in my small guest bedroom  office.  It sounded good in that room but Id never use it as a primary sound system.,bose,dbhpua6,1,t5_2ykqh

10128240,0,t1_dbom4gy,Nope. The problem seemed to work itself out for a while maybe after I turned on voice prompts but it seems to have returned full force in the last few weeks. Im thinking about contacting Bose and having them give me another pair. I love these headphones but this problem is super frustrating.,bose,dbrprom,1,t5_2ykqh
10233018,0,t3_5lr62u,Do you have a problem with the aux cable like me? The cable and pair I am using for christmas have an issue somewhere. One of the two is having problems connecting at the headphone jack port. Not sure if it is the cable not getting good connection even when plugged all the way in i triple checked or if the jack itself has issues of that sort wondering if i should call bose?,bose,dc3yxk6,1,t5_2ykqh
10335254,0,t3_5nz48z,Dont know of a dongle but I found it very easy to just have the aux connected to the controller. Beats the purpose of wireless but the cable is so discreet that its fine.  ,bose,dcfk4qc,4,t5_2ykqh
10357010,0,t3_5objum,Your mileage may vary but this  one worked for me on a Dell XXX Inspiron with Windows .. The stock Dell BT drivers didnt work for constant audio streaming. Now I can stream Spotify without any issues. Pretty low profile on the laptop as well. Download the driver package from the URL on the box.,bose,dci0zz8,1,t5_2ykqh
10464345,0,t3_5pvsqq,Try updating the headphones on a smartphone with Boses app.  From what I recall Boses program is more of a browser plugin.  You download the Bose updater but still have to point your browser Chrome or Safari to Boses update site The only standalone program they offer for updating anything is for the SoundTouch series.,bose,dcu8na6,1,t5_2ykqh

10901187,0,t3_5vrokz,Their sound quality is the same as it has always been sculpted.  The QCs are indistinguishable from the QCs and those were miles above all their other earbuds even the ones released in .  The QCs while not for everyone Im not a fan of their adaptive EQ that changes with volume are Boses highest reviewed headphones ever.The SoundLink Color II speaker is also an improvement over the first one and sounds better than most other Bluetooth speakers in the same price category.  Their SoundTouch  speaker sounds better than other wifi speakers in the  price much better than Sonos their Companion  Series III speakers sound better than other  computer speakers with dedicated subwoofers and I can keep going on.So no Boses sound quality hasnt decreased over time.  They still offer an inaccurate sculpted sound with everything.  The main thing that has changed over time is other companies have caught on and implemented a similar vshaped sound signature where the lows and highs are boosted while the mids are recessed.  Beats Sony Skullcandy JBL and tons of other have followed in Boses footsteps.  That still doesnt mean that Bose isnt the best at some things.  Their QCs are the best noise cancelling wireless earbuds theyre also the best noise cancelling earbuds on the market.  Im also a big fan of their Acoustimass  Series V speakers.  There are comparable and better speakers in that price category but theyre much larger and dont hide in a setup nearly as well.Lastly Bose did away with the exchange program because too many people were taking advantage of it.  You can still take your products into a store and they will often replace them with an offtheshelf new product if youre within the oneyear warranty.  Too many people were exchanging their headphones when there wasnt anything wrong Bose was also loosing money with their tradeup program.,bose,de4dovd,7,t5_2ykqh

11369670,0,t1_dfkpt9c,I decided its not worth getting the QC. I recently lost me pair of earbuds so I decided I should get a pair of those first since I use earbuds more often.
