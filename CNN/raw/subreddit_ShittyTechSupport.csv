3275060,0,t3_2xll13,Hey there OP.  Just wanted to clear a few things up since there seem to be some very misleading comments in this thread.As an amateur programmer I feel obliged to help you out in this situation.  First of all you must understand that most wireless routers dont have a particularly long range.  Specifically there is no way that your standard wireless router will have a long enough range to reach your work.  However there are a few things you could do to improve the range.Many people dont realize this but the power supply unit of your computer  thats the metal box inside your computer tower  operates on the same frequency as most wireless routers.  When your computer is running the range of your wireless router may be greatly impacted because of your power supply unit.  But fear not there are ways of changing the frequency on which your power supply operates.First of all youll need to open up the power supply unit using screwdrivers.  Dont worry about the power cord  it can stay plugged in since this is a very short process.  Once you get the power supply open go and get a cold pitcher of water.  Adding water to your power supply every week will help to dampen any fluctuations in the frequency it operates on.  Before the water has a chance to warm to room temperature quickly pour it into your power supply.  It is imperative that the water stays cold!  Once its in there make sure to mix it well preferably with your bare hands.  Mix that shit up real good.  Once youre finished close up the power supply and youre all done!  Enjoy boundless internet wherever you go!Disclaimer dont actually do this youll die.,ShittyTechSupport,cp1l0vb,1,t5_2t2dc
