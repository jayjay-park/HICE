2440766,0,t3_2ndulu,Awesome writeup! Even if I was just barely right i had several concepts needing fix now Ill remember to think about more things than I did there.Oh I have a side question. What is the difference between a normal and a money game? The books and places where Ive read about BG havent detailed whats significantly different so I have no idea what Im supposed to focus on a money well or a normal game game.,backgammon,cmddtwh,1,t5_2qlki

2866596,0,t1_cntwr73,I think ublueflights comment is right on. To ELI it a bit Youve got a  point prime right now five covered numbers together blocking black in your home. Its better to take checkers off a middle number rather than the back number because you have a better chance of keeping black contained longer and giving yourself a chance to catch up.,backgammon,cntxlbk,2,t5_2qlki

5407559,0,t3_3nv35a,I felt the same way when I first started playing versus Gnu and then XG. I think its a combination of a couple things. The program plays very well and puts the opponent in situations where they are likely to leave shots. I think we pay more attention to shots that are unlikely and then when the computer hits it reinforces the memory.Keep playing and youll find that its not the program at all. And like others have said doing your own analysis will likely improve your own play.Edit I tried using the asterisk to make a couple of bullet points but it didnt work for some reason. Sorry for the strange formatting. Found that you need two line breaks before the first asterisk in your list.,backgammon,cw2vjr7,1,t5_2qlki

Also define whether you are playing legal moves or not.is there a good faq for this?I also thought youre supposed to use two sets of die because when the player picks up their dice its considered the end of their turn. Is that a made up rule? haha,backgammon,d0rcrqh,1,t5_2qlki
7017781,0,t3_4bpu2r,I used the Excalibur and thought it was fine. This was years ago but I did think the buttons felt a little flimsy but they always worked so maybe it wasnt really a problem.Programming it was tricky but not crazy hard. I remember using a tutorial online but I dont remember which one. This however is the first one that pops up and matches roughly what I remember. The Excalibur doesnt have backgammon specific rules in it so you have to use the custom options which is what makes it more involved.I know nothing about the Saitek but would be a bit surprised if it had backgammon specific modes built in.,backgammon,d1btb8k,1,t5_2qlki

7855181,0,t1_d3yz1qm,Youll definitely want a good book like weve been talking about. Learn to count pips there are many different methods find one you like and stick with it. But the biggest thing that players do is to collect reference positions. You will definitely want to get either XG Windows and paid or gnubg all platforms free and pay attention to what youre doing wrong and right. Dont just rely on the analysis but do rollouts. And save positions for later study. And when you save a position  especially one you missed  play around with the checkers till you figure out how it changes the outcome. So if you played one way that turned out to be a blunder figure out what would have to be different in that position to make your play correct. And then remember it!The top players have huge catalogs of such reference positions that allow them to look at their current game situation and compare it against the positions theyve memorized which then helps them make the right decision.Memorize at least the first two moves and at all scores. Its surprising how much equity even good players give up by not knowing how best to play a second roll at a certain score.Thats a lot right there but doing these things counting  playing and analyzing games in XG or gnubg studying your reference positions and memorizing the opening rolls will get you to intermediate play and with solid technique youll be quite successful at that level.,backgammon,d3yzrq8,2,t5_2qlki
