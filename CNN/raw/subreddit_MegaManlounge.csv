1752356,0,t1_ck00y2r,HAHA!  Creating flair is the one thing I really wanted to learn because I felt the Mega Lounges didnt have enough custom flair and I wanted to OVERLOAD MML with custom flair.  Speaking as someone without a lot of rudimentary programming knowledge  but perhaps with slightly more experience than you  it is not so hard once you figure out the process.  But it is a slight process.  Ive actually held off on creating more flair for a while because it eats up the CSS stylesheet space  and there is a finite amount of space for you to work with.Flair is probably the one area I could help you with.  Beyond that Im limited ,MegaManlounge,ck01jko,4,t5_325l2

2015150,0,t3_2htjtw,I see a lot of good thinking in these replies. From the tone of your original post it really sounds like you dont want to go. My biggest question here is why is HIS job the determining factor here? I have to assume you had discussions about him possibly going out of state while he was interviewing but then maybe its something he decided on his own. Without that information I cant really weigh in.While youre young and fairly movable I would still be cautious about picking up and leaving to be with your man if youre not completely certain you want to be together for life. Reason being the further away you are from your support network and the more reliant you are on him the harder it is to get out if thats what you decide you need to do. I speak from experience having lived with someone while I wasnt earning a whole heck of a lot. When I wanted to leave I didnt have the resources I needed which made it x harder and I wasted a lot of time. This isnt a decision you need to make right now. You can stay where you are and see how it goes being apart. It may be that you find you cant stand the separation and theres your answer. Or  you may find you dont mind it overly much and thats an answer too. Honestly Im a little irrationally mad at your boyfriend for putting this on you right now.

As I was reading I was expecting to read the revelation of what it was but in finishing I saw that it could be taken as any difference. Bravo. My nephew is autistic and still a very bright child. He is only  hours older than my son so they are almost identical in age and being that it is my brothers kid their genetics are very similar. They both dealt with their parents divorcing within a year of each other. I am always fascinated at how much they are different and how much they are very alike. ,MegaManlounge,cn129j3,3,t5_325l2

2634065,0,t1_cn29a4o,Born in NYC liked baseball from when I was  or  years old so I was a Mets fan first and Yankees fan when it didnt interfere with the Mets. Moved to Houston when I was  learned and liked football there so was an Oilers fan. My brother  years younger got to like the Astros but I was still all for the Mets so we would fight about that. I was a minor fan of the Rockets but never big into basketball. Enjoyed the Houston Gamblers USFL football team when it was active but that wasnt for long. Briefly attended U of H but never completed a single class there and the college I mostly went to youve never heard of it didnt do college sports so was never a college sports fan EVER not the Cougars not the Memphis Tigers nothing...just dont care.  Moved to Memphis when I was  and within a year or so the Oilers left Houston played a game or two in Memphis I saw them play the Rams at the Liberty Bowl then move to Nashville and become the Titans.  By then I was already faltering in my interest for football and for sports in general.  The Memphis Riverkings minor league hockey team came along and I was dating my future wife so we went to see a couple of games.  Meh.  When the Riverkings moved down to Mississippi we werent bothered...its not far across the border and the southern boundary of Memphis IS the state line...theres even a State Line Road so when our son was old enough we took him to see a game when a friend gave us free tickets.  Still meh.  Then the Memphis Grizzlies came along and I briefly got interested in NBA again.  But still not a big sports guy any more.  The Grizz have been doing REAL good this year not last night though and a lot of my friends are into it.  So I watch with them sometimes but its still all just ltshruggt to me. The only thing I know about the Rangers is thats where Nolan Ryan finished his career and the only think I know about the Texans is that they exist.,MegaManlounge,cn2empg,2,t5_325l2

2748098,0,t3_2rj5ym,Whats up with my butt? Im not sure why anyone would care to read about my butt but Ill share nonetheless. Some of this will be kind of gross and uncomfortable so be warned. Butts arent exactly flowers and rainbows.Due to some shoulder pain I havent been getting my regular workouts at the gym so I havent been squatting more than my own bodyweight. Im waiting for my shoulder to heal so I can balance a heavy barbell across my back again. Gotta keep working toward having that squat butt!Further inside I have not been putting very many things in my butt lately. A few days ago my girlfriend wanted to peg me but she only got it about  inches in before it started to hurt so we had to stop. I need to stretch my butt with a butt plug more regularly so we can try again and have it go better.Ive been doing regular kegels for a couple months now which have strengthened my pelvic floor significantly. This means that the muscles inside the bottom of my abdomen including those inside my butt have been getting stronger. Kegels are not just for women! Men doing kegels often have larger harder erections and more endurance during sexytimes. They are a wonderful addition to a normal exercise program and can be done anywhere.I do not keep a wallet in my back pocket and any time I do put one in my pocket my butt feels really uncomfortable. My butt and back do not want to deal with that nonsense. I keep my wallet in the breast pocket of my jacket or in the event of jacketlessness my front pants pocket.I recently started eating a lot of these weird protein powder drinks because I got the packets of powder for free and the high protein helps me reach my daily protein goals. Since I started consuming them almost daily my shits have become greasy as fuck and hard to wipe. Ive needed to use about twice as much toilet paper as normal. Still Im consistently getting stronger while losing body fat and feeling fantastic so the extra gross shits are a small price to pay.,MegaManlounge,cngg40w,5,t5_325l2
