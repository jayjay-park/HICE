389928,0,t1_cfl5hr1,If all goes as planned the individual factions will have enough autonomy under the current system that they will be essentially managing themselves only with similar systems and like spirits. Disputes will be handled similarly guild banks leadership decisions only the factionspecific things and rosters will be different.,esoredditguild,cfl6k2w,2,t5_30cxd

423647,0,t3_1xwp2e,Im Milkshaker living in The Netherlands. Im going to play a Dunmer in the Aldmeri Dominion. Havent decided which class yet tried out different ones just not sure yet. As an MMO player ive played WoW as a hardcore raider SWTOR WAR and some other games. My main interests in ESO will be a helpful I dont mean boost me plx help but generally kind and knowledgeble community of people in a guild to PVE and PVP with. I suspect that I will be a hardcore casual i.e. wanting to be hardcore but time restraints usually get in the wayI am usually up for a dungeon or pvp group when Im playing and will probably want to pick up the healer or tank role a decent amount of times.,esoredditguild,cfooch7,2,t5_30cxd
440204,0,t3_1z3zx2,Im kind of thinking it may be a good idea to create a cross faction guild with a group of our best crafters so they can post items for sale between guilds. Leave  slots empty for members to join in buy then leave. The guild master could purge the guild every week of people not registered to stay.,esoredditguild,cfqe4ba,1,t5_30cxd
497418,0,t3_1znlws,I like the idea of a guild youtube could be nice for people that wanna join our guild to see what we do in our guild and see how our community is!We should focus on all sorts of content! PvP exploring questing farmingcrafting fun moments and such!PTS is always nice imo!,esoredditguild,cfwt67l,2,t5_30cxd
512921,0,t1_cfy6e87,It depends wholly on how the game is patched in regards to more customization. I think what we would be looking for from ZOS is a numerical limit to the amount of items someone would be able to take out at any given rank. Then wed be able to keep a good handle on who was taking out and who was putting in and could be available to withdraw more for a player who had put in well more than they were capable of getting out.,esoredditguild,cfyklri,1,t5_30cxd

686408,0,t3_21zmky,Do we want to join one that EP is already winning or one where we can turn the tide? Obviously campaigns will have a longterm life thats tough to predict.,esoredditguild,cgianys,3,t5_30cxd
694653,0,t1_cgj6a4h,You dont need to avoid the sun. But vampires do have  weakness to fire. It is quite substantial penalty. So I expect that only about  will choose this route.,esoredditguild,cgj8fnp,1,t5_30cxd

1001965,0,t3_25k1hp,Hiya.  My account is Tanjent and my main character is Arlas bosmer nightblade archer.  So far all my gameplay has been on AD US.Im sidelining crafting as I go fiddling in most of the product lines on one character or another.  Glad to make trait items whenever I can and useful items if you can help with materials as needed.  Dont get too excited though I havent gotten all that far along in most of the crafts.So far Im enjoying the questing and storylines.  I havent done a lot of PvP so far but I had a good bit of fun when I did.,esoredditguild,chi6jh5,1,t5_30cxd
