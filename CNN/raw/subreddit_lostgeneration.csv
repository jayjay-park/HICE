That and crony capitalism is just normal capitalism since the state in capitalism exists only for the benefit of the ruling class.

Ill give you benefit of the doubt for now and assume the latter since I dont feel like looking at the exact message I posted EDIT yeah this is the one where i just gave a quick summary without explaining the numbers sorry.My figures assume MASSIVE cuts. Like the entire social safety net is dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up. Between social security  billion medicaremedicaid  billion welfare  billion and other cuts  billion we can knock the budget down to . trillion. Universal healthcare if our spending per capita is the same as other countries which it likely would be if we have universal healthcare would be closer to . trillion. I assumed . for sake of calculation although even if it were higher it wouldnt impact taxation much.  flat tax would cover THAT and basic income. Between that and basic income yes the state could cut a lot. They wouldnt need welfare. They wouldnt need healthcare. They wouldnt need unemployment insurance. Theyd be able to eliminate all that. This would allow states to make their budgets a lot more like in current red states or maybe even smaller. So instead of that inflated  rate you get in NY you might get . City taxes will likely remain the same since their big expenditures are police fire education and core services like trash collection and utilities and stuff although in my experience city taxes are generally low. Like  or something at best.Also does that chart factor in local taxes? I doubt it Ive see it before and its national only if Im not mistaken.Anyway assume . trillion and  million people in that calculator set corporate and income tax rates to . You get a k UBI.

The confirmation bias trap makes this propaganda very effective as it is designed to pit people against each other by vaguely telling people what the problem is then allowing the human mind to fill in the missing details. In essence fooling someone to think that theyve come to a conclusion based on their own empirical evidence. When the truth of the matter is they were told what to think from the get go. But in order for the person to truly believe the lie they have to think they came to the conclusion independently confirmation bias. All it takes is one weak example to finish off the conditioning. In many cases the media provides this example through sensationalist articles involving people way out of the mainstream of society.Are there lazy millennials? Sure. Are they any more lazy than previous generations not in my experience. But all you need to do is find ONE to validate a conclusion youve already made about millions of others hence the confirmation bias.Its a divide and conquer strategy. If the ruling class didnt pit parents against children their heads would be on pikes right now. Fact of the matter is millennials have some of the highest education rates in American history. Recessions tend to disproportionately affect people who are on the fringes of the labor market people trying to enter for the first time and people deemed too old to work.

Student loan debt is just another straw on the back of the already overloaded working class camel.Im stuck in the situation where I cant possibly save up enough to put a responsible down payment on a home in my area. I need  minimum to have  and I have no way of growing my savings other than risk it in the stock market.

However mo isnt worth my happiness in an environment where I wont get a better rate of return out in the market versus spending it on creature comforts. Need I remind folks that this is by design from the Federal Reserve Bank. The whole reason for ZIRP is to promote spending over saving by placing working class people into the same situation that Im in currently.Interest rates may be low but I plan to buy to own not to pay a mortgage in perpetuity.

I dont know what to tell you. I enjoy what I do yes it has been a lot of work yes the pay is good when I speak to high schoolers or college students and they ask me about engineering I do suggest they consider it.I would like to point out that the effect of people getting a degree in a stem field and moving out I think has been exaggerated. To give an example of myself I was offered a position as a project manager at a software group. Now all I was taught in school in terms of programming was very basic. I could have moved out of electrical engineering and moved into software engineering but decided not too. Everyone I knew from school who graduated with an engineering degree is still in the field. Some of them changed subfields some of them are now mangers but all of them still design.The right way to become an electrical engineer has not changed. Go to school and get an engineering degree. You can work your way up the ranks but it takes a long time and it is harder to change employers. The good news about engineering is you can generally get away with a  year degree. I do know people with masters and full doctorate but it is quite possible to do well without it.

Sure most Americans are wasteful and there are ways that we can all reduce our environmental impact but the ascetic offgrid commune life of an ecominimalist isnt for everyone and its not a realistic solution to our current problems. For a large corporation Costco is remarkably ethical  moreso even than most of its small local competitors.  And theyre doing it in a profitable way thats more likely to encourage other companies to adopt similar policies.  Theyre providing a realistic alternative to the WalMart business model and the minimum wage society.  Yes there are still downsides to consumerism and global trade but relieving some of the pressure that average people feel to buy cheap at all costs will increase their willingness to spend a little more money for sustainable and domestically produced goods.

Not only do more qualified students face more competition for a spot in college but the less qualified students who leave without graduating often carry the feeling of being a failure for the rest of their lives.We have gutted the votech education in high school that not only taught useful skills but also introduced students to trades that they otherwise may not have known they had any interest in.

2755464,0,t1_cnh9dw8,witchbrew let me be honest with you. I did voted in the midterms I had to vote straight ticket because in the local seats there was NO COMPETITOR. Even in the court and the county council section on the ballot there was only one candidate no competitor. Guess who was only available on the ballot Democrats. And they had no real plan for the real issues in my state.And Im past fed up of people ignoring structural problems or socioeconomic class issues related to low voting turnout as excuses or lazyness. Especially when you mention thisgtRich older people are voting in droves its the young and the poor who arent. In the previous midterm election  of eligible people from households earning more than k voted as opposed to  of those under k.  of people over  voted as opposed to  of  yearolds.gtThe older generation also shows up and does something about it. I cant tell you how many times Ive tried to get people on a local board go to an eventfundraiser or even try to be active in any way whatsoever. People  and under just dont do it they dont give a shit.  and over theyre all over it. Theyll show up to events sit on boards talk amongst themselves and campaign.You said it yourself you hypocrite! Disagreeing that its a class issue then explaining the socioeconomic fact behind it. People over the age of  have the time because theyre retired from their jobs or wealthy enough to be retired! People under that are still have jobs and in this economy and in some cases have parttime low wage jobs. Ive mention this in my previous post and you disregard it and then said the same practical thing for your argument. This is not only a structural issue its a socioeconomic class issue and you basically dismissed it as an excuse. You are pretending that structural issues and socioeconomic class aspects of voter apathy do not exist.,lostgeneration,cnha96u,1,t5_2r40j

2792091,0,t3_2rqym9,I grew up in North America.  My father had a job that provided him with a pension and health care after retirement. He owns his house and vehicles outright.  Yet he didnt pay for any of my education.  He also accepted a house instead of acres of land that he could have handed down as an inheritance.  Thats fine.  It taught me to be self reliant and determined to make it on my own.  I paid down  degrees on my own and can say I got there under my own steam.  It is highly annoying when I hear him complaining about money though. Fast forward a few years later.  I now live in Australia and see ultimate boomer behaviour.  The boomer politicians created negative gearing here and continue to sell off real estate to foreigners.  The combination of these things has kept housing prices at ridiculous levels here.  Those same boomer politicians all have multimillion dollar real estate portfolios and will do whatever they can to artificially keep the housing market high.  I am waiting for that bubble to burst.  However I think that it will just cause more of these old farts to continue to work and delay retirement.  ,lostgeneration,cnlg83c,1,t5_2r40j

3080691,0,t1_coh91z9,I understand the POINT of the black bloc but the EFFECT isnt working toward the desired OUTCOME. If a tactic isnt working why keep using it? Say some business is acting like youre saying and gets targeted. Great a broken window and some stolen items... Which are insured. In the end the store owner gets a new window a mild reduction in foot traffic and has to wait for a new shipment to restock some items. Unless you return every goddamned day or every week for months you arent going to do enough damage to the bottom line to change their tune.And in all honesty thats not how the black bloc is acting in this area. Theyre causing random mayhem not targeted mayhem. See Snapping off car mirrors and the like. Theyre not batman and theyll never just happen to know the identities of the bad business owners and those that arent. The only one I ever got a chance to talk to was convinced that by escalating events and increasing the chance of police brutality would help lead to a revolution. That shits fucking delusional when you look at reality where protesters can be cowed into submission by a measured amount of brutality.Other things like whipping bottles at the cops from the middle of a march which was otherwise acting peacefully. The idea Id guess is to get the cops to do what they do best and hope that the protesters escalate their actions and resolve in response... But thats not what actually happens as protesters tend to really just be normal mild mannered people. When confronted with beatings pepper spray tear gas and mass arrests which never reach the courts the protesters inevitably wind up losing momentum. The police arent using these tactics because theyre ineffective theyre not stupid. Theyre doing it to crush resolve and it works. Then when the older generation hears about the protests that one asshole whipping a bottle gets shown a thousand times adding the appearance credibility to the claims of authoritarians. The protesters lose the people lose the authorities win.Yes... They were going to do that anyway so what was the point of whipping a bottle then? Its not going to do shit to a cop in full riot gear making it a meaningless gesture at best.This shit only works if there is widespread support for their actions which simply isnt the case. ,lostgeneration,cohb8ap,1,t5_2r40j

I never understood why we always had to do chores and why my parents would punish themselves by cooking cleaning and doing the yard. Of course now that Im an adult Im s bit of a stickler for keeping my shit in order. When I rented with friend I always was annoyed at how little they cared about the state of the house...now that I bought a house my girlfriend and I know it reflects on us and pretty actively care for the house and try to improve things. My dad is pretty frugal since he was  of  where my mom is more typical middle class spendwhatyouveearned. Im pretty lucky his dont pay people to do what you can do yourself attitude kept us fixing things our whole lives. He had an apartment he rented out and we learned plumbing and painting doing repairs there. The attitude has helped me to be more frugal and take enjoyment in a job well done. The big difference is that I found a gal who is frugal too. I finally found a career job that pays after a decade of part time school and full to part time work. She makes around  grand and in  years of work socked away about  grand. I have a lot of debt but I make close to  grand now and only live on around  of it due to the past decade ingrains get frugal habits. The rest goes toward getting this debt slavery collar off of me. My dad seems to understand but my mom who I think is a bit more typical of her generation doesnt understand why I wouldnt just make the minimum payment and go on vacations and cruises and buy new furniture. Shes never lost a job. Ive had more jobs in my short working life then she has had her entire life. More interviews more applications more of everything and Ive seen it disappear because of the economy despite being the guy with the budget sheet in front of me preparing a report for what a record quarter it was going to be. Basically I think we will all end up a bit more frugal and much more wary of debt. Unlike the Great Depression I dont think we will be as scared of investing and hiding out fortunes under the mattress. We will hopefully get the best of both worlds and I think things will be looking up for us all in  years when baby boomers soft lazy bodies just cannot handle work anymore whether or not they can afford to quit. ,lostgeneration,cop8ym6,4,t5_2r40j

Parts of it yes largely because employeeemployer mutual loyalty has all but completely eroded in that same timeframe but its rare for there not to be additional training once an employee starts anyway.gt  the cost of college is really screwing over more people than its helpingThe cost to the student for what Im describing would in my world be effectively zero...you wouldnt start paying into the system until you do so through taxes after you are gainfully employed.,lostgeneration,cp9jl6j,1,t5_2r40j

I dont think it is dangerous to trust my coding team. I trust them with lots of things. They are grown adults capable of making such choices and I trust them. They have to work with this person anyway and would have to fix their code constantly so they have little reason to lie. Plus as a manager if I cant trust the people who work for me I have royally fucked up already.I dont care what your educational background is for this specific role others we do all I care is can you get the job done.  If the rest of my coding team says you can I trust them.   Now we only develop for in house use not commerical yet so that is part of it.

3377686,0,t1_cpd02zc,I can see what youre saying but the reality is that they did have a reason to do it. She brought in more revenueprofit than expected because she worked hard. Hard work is more than x the investment. For example bear with me this is hypothetical but still supplements my point if I hired a person to clean  building but theyre so goodhard working that he or she cleaned  buildings he or she is an excellent investment. So instead of paying  people to clean  buildings I pay  person to clean both and give a bonus. This is much cheaper than paying the salary of  employees. When the ROI of an employee reaches a high level a bonus is an excellent investment in the retention of said employee because the employee brings in more than he or she is worth. Either way every employee is an investment some are just better investments suckers than others. ,lostgeneration,cpda54b,4,t5_2r40j

3391130,0,t1_cpekxkk,Probably not but thats not how it works currently either.Throughout their working career they pay taxes based on their income which go to provide benefits for someone else. The tax formula changes periodically as needed to help keep the system solvent.In retirement they receive benefits based on an average of the income. The benefit formula has changed since they started working as needed to keep the system solvent.Not only are the formulas not tied together at any given time the benefit recipient is receiving benefits based on the formula in place when he retires when he paid taxes based on formulas from decades earlier. On top of that we already have taxation on higher benefits effectively reducing benefits for higher incomes.Your question really is asking whether the income cap would be the same for both tax and benefit formulas going forward. And the answer is probably no uncapping benefits is unneeded and would greatly increase costs.

3894772,0,t1_cqzio0i,Heres what I have generally seen in the last  years or so...Employers want people with degrees.  Fair enough.  So you go get a degree and do well decent GPA took the super difficult classes in a STEM major get internships etc..After college it was Oh good job on the degree but you dont have the  years of experience.After hearing that experience line several times you finally get a job offer for less than optimal position take it figuring it is better than the alternatives decent pay related to your degree not working at a min wage job not working at all.  You figure that you can continue looking for something better in the meantime.  You also continue networking volunteering and working on your own personal projects.  Now of course employers are making the assumption that since you never got into anything more mainstreamsimilar to what that employer does youre no good.And of course since you have been with your current employer a long time youve gotten raisespromotions and accrued a metric ton of vacation which makes it harder to move. ,lostgeneration,cr08kzi,2,t5_2r40j

The voter that votes in this manner is referred to as a donkey voter.gtTypically this involves numbering the candidates in the order they appear on the ballot paper first preference for the firstlisted candidate second preference for the secondlisted candidate and so on. However donkey votes can also occur in reverse such that someone numbers the candidates from the bottom up the ballot paper. In systems where a voter is required to place a number against each candidate for the vote to be valid the voter may give the first preference to the candidate they prefer then run all the other numbers donkey fashion.gtDonkey votes are most common where preference voting is combined with compulsory voting such as in Australia particularly where all candidates must be ranked on the ballot paper. There are different versions of the phenomenon applicable in the Australian House of Representatives Australian Senate and in the Australian jurisdictions that use the HareClark single transferable vote system.gtDonkey votes may occur for several reasons including voter apathy protest voting the complexity of the voting system or voter ignorance of the voting system rules alternately what appears as a donkey vote may in fact be a genuine representation of a voters preferences.gtSometimes the term donkey vote may also be used to refer to an informal vote submitting a blank or defaced ballot paper although this use is not included in major dictionaries. citation neededgtInteresting Robson Rotation | Voter apathy | Ticket election | Precinct Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcsukpe oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecsukpe.

Outstanding student debt sizable as it is pales in comparison to the housing market and hasnt been monetized in similar scale. billion sounds like a lot but its a drop in the bucket compared to what was going on with MBS CDS and the OTC derivatives market. Its qualitatively different because a homeowner can walk away from an underwater mortgage student debt can only be discharged by the sweet release of death. It just cant collapse the way the housing market did itll be much slower. Instead well have a malingering economy for along time with things getting worse and worse but there wont be a pop and sudden rapid decline. There will be a heavy social toll and unrest once it fully sets in that we have all these financial obligations for the old folks and extremely poor young folks are left with the tab.

5081069,0,t1_cuy8hip,Its super easy when you use bullshit hypothetical scenarios! Paying someone to take care of your child is a childcare cost.Should the stayathome parent make less than the working parents? Why should they make less than what a daycare would charge considering theyll be providing food attention toys water and electricity as well as having wear and tear on their house and property and their sanity. Should they do it out of the goodness of their own heart? Even if they charge only what they need to break even on costs theyre working their ass off caring for in the  parent  child scenario up to ten children youd need less care for children in school assuming its not summer but that also means the ones that the one parent cares for all day are infants and toddlers who require constant care and attention...  why shouldnt they actually make money on it even a pittance? And at what point is the cost still more than can be absorbed from minimum wage and since in this scenario the parents arent sending their children to a certified daycare theyre not likely to get any financial assistance towards childcare. Of course for many of those counties the living wage for a family of four is still above minimum wage x  so even in your fantasy they still dont make it in a big way.Coming up with your solution was probably easy  making it work in reality for the poor human beings out there isnt even close. Do you believe that every poor family has four other families nearby that they can work this out with or did you not bother to think about that?People are still relying on nonprofessional daycare somewhat like the type you describe in communities today. It still doesnt solve the bigger problem its just cheaper than professional daycare you know the ones that run background checks have certifications and training etc.?.If youre giving yourself a pat on the back for this solution youre deluding yourself. ,lostgeneration,cuygmi6,3,t5_2r40j

If youre going to pick an individual to think about why not the homeless person? But the argument capitalists make is that capitalism is the most efficient from a societal perspective. In this case its clearly not true. There are empty houses and people who need houses to live in. There is no actual physical reason why those people cant live in those houses only conceptualeconomic ones like the idea that one person can own a bunch of property they dont use while others starve on the street. In some other economic systems there would be no landlord for that empty house because you wouldnt be allowed to monopolize three houses while someone else is sleeping under a bridge.The capitalist theory of utility economics says that the person who owns three houses must want them all more than the homeless person because they were willing to pay more for them.

5946587,0,t1_cxz3ydm,I think its pretty clear that abundance is due to exponential growth in technology it has nothing to do with politics. Low skill jobs were plentiful in the th century because the investment in machines needed people to tend them at that stage in development. Also a great many jobs were too complicated for the rudimentary machines of that time to do they all required people because we did not have computers. Now we increasingly do. And they fall in price rapidly doubling in value for money every  months. That doesnt mean that most of humanity should become idle. What it means is that the skills bar to employment demands more skills for people to get hired so we need to invest more energy into education globally. We also need to figure out how to make life all of it more supportive of lifelong education. Some employers allow employees to work on their own projects as long as they are constructive additions to the company or the community or ideally both. Since machines will do more work people will need to do more thought. And we will be living in enriched environments and our brains will grow. Were being presented with a stark choice and we need to move to the next step together peacefully. People are advocating a huge pulling back a privatization of education and healthcare framing public services as a theft from corporations. That is utterly wrong. Look at it this way to privatize everything will create a society where almost nobody can get a job because of the cost of education. Bringing in low wage service workers wont be acceptable because they need to be earning mote money at home. The window of time will be short and by midcentury self aware robots will be able to do a great deal of teaching. Why so fast? Because the growth on human knowledge is an exponential function. In the next  years we will much more than double the sum total of human knowledge knowledge it took us more than  years to acquire. So the urgency is very high to stop playing games with our future. No matter what we do we need to move on to the next stage eventually and that stage is one where people do not need to work unless they WANT to. And we should think about the fact that people like learning its a flow experience and we should be more generous as a society. That does not mean taking things from poor people either. People need to save what they can  imagine the problem of trying to save enough money now for all of your future descendants. Thats really not so practical is it?We need to make a great many things free and devote a lot of energy to figuring out a plan which will make us all the better with them. And stop thinking that jobs define people as most jobs will be evolutionary companies may last but technologies and products will increasingly often have a short lifetime. As things chage faster and faster. Jobs will also change constantly. And most people will not have them unless we are willing to also embrace a level of change and creativity we dont have a grasp of now. By mid century we will have computers that think. Long before then most jobs will be done by them and most people can move on to other things IF we as a society create a world that gives people more options people will use them and prosperity will continue  The work places of the future will also be information sharing centers  that makes work also learning and paradoxically more productive of wealth. Wealth is a product of both creativity and other forms of labor. We need to find better ways to balance the two. Children have a natural creativity that until a few decades ago we routinely beat out of them. That still is far too common. But it has to stop. As it ends up wasting a great deal or peoples lives. We cant do that any more. Its too much time to waste.We have to accept that within our lifetimes we will get to a point where a great many even most people will never get good enough at what they do to get a job any job. We should just see lifelong education as necessary for everybody. We should do the best we can to figure out how to make all of life a learning and teaching experience.The economic world we live in is not going to go away if we change to adapt to this new normal. Nor will money vanish or be abolished. Basically we just are coming into our adolescence and soon hopefully our adulthood as a species. Thats more often than not an exciting positive time.Eventually jobs will require literally the very most exceptional ability. In order for people to get to that point they will need to learn their skills for a long period without any income its likely. We have to learn to live with that. We simply need to stop being so idiotically greedy. We should realize that we as a society have earned this rest because of technology a gift we all own. A gift that we have devoted thousands of years to getting to. But even if we dont adapt it will still happen. Because the more we learn the faster we learn more.,lostgeneration,cxz4lu6,1,t5_2r40j

Praying over lottery tickets for gods blessing to save them from poverty.These idiots would win  and get excited as hell completely ignoring the FACT that they spend a thousand dollars this year to win . They just want an escape from their shitty lives and they live in denial.If  of these people stopped wasting money on lottery smokes and shitty beer every day they might not be in such a hopeless financial situation. Most of them were either white or ghetto trash that could barely be classified as sentient. They were just human ashtrays and beer receptacles that had unfortunately reproduced multiple times and had a few bucks to waste on a brief escape from their hopeless dumpsterfire of an existence.The day welfare checks were received was ALWAYS a busy day at the lotto counter. Of course lots of them tried to sell food stamps EBT for cash to spend on the lotto and beer. The line at the lotto register was like a human zoo of failure substance abuse and bad judgement... with children in tow.The lottery is an idiot tax only these people pay. Some of the money goes back into roads and schools in my state but it should be more like nearly every penny besides what they need to keep the lights on and the lottery ticket machines printing tickets.These fools might as well be turned into useful idiots and use the money they waste on the lotto to pay for them being a drag on society at large  hence idiot tax.,lostgeneration,cyw093u,19,t5_2r40j

If Im understanding the issue correctly the issue at hand affects people not just techies who live and work in SF  not remotely. There is a valid tech scene in the city proper. Not all techies commute to South bay. I understand techbros letter takes on a classist tone that implies its only techs problem and I completely disagree with that. It affects everyone walking to work or transit. No I dont have a solution.  but I do resonate with the complaint of hundreds of pedestrians otw to work dodging feces and tents on the sidewalk.

As such requiring them to pay all this extra overtime and have these strict scheduling systems would probably significantly affect the operation of the business and its viability to succeed.  As I said to another person I think when a family member works for a business theyre essentially a de facto member of the owner class. They effectively own the means of production even if indirectly.

He cut education laid off hundreds of teachers in the middle of the recession opposed the medicaid expansion caved on it when he was losing his reelection bid but implemented it in a messed up passive aggressive manner. Quite frankly the only reason the GOP is doing well is because of opposition to obama. And the democrats defeated and dejected by their party not doing anything dont have the enthusiasm to come out and vote. Thats the only reason the GOP is winning. Voter turnout among democrats is low. A vocal minority is winning because the democrats are basically fed up with their party. Quite frankly these trends will continue and even get worse under president clinton. But they could reverse themselves under a president trump. With the GOP controlling the government they cant blame the democrats its all on them. And as they mess things up the voters will get angry and be outraged and come out to vote. Not to mention a couple years to distance themselves from the obama presidency might do them good where they dont keep insisting on  more years of the same thing we had for  years and are tired of. The democratic party is too invested in its current party trajectory and too unwilling to change what they deem to be a successful formula. I believe the majority of people these days actually trend liberal. ESPECIALLY millennials which cant be bothered to vote much at all. But the thing is the liberals are kinda alienated from the status quo. Because the democratic party isnt really doing anything. And everything they do they do half ed. Look at clinton vs sanders in the general election. Clinton represents the current course of the democrats and she loses to most republicans outside of trump. But sanders can beat the republicans. This is about voter energy. its about party alignments. Its about tapping into groups of people alienated by the current status quo. You need to energize people. You need to get them fired up.And this is whats so scary about this election. The democrats got low turnout in  they have no idea why. Theyre clueless. They go into  with these shady tactics against bernie sanders and this whole anti progressive vote blue no matter who attitude. They insist on killing the one candidate who could energize people in the general to win to push a candidate  of the democrats potential voter base doesnt even like and wont even show up to vote for. The real problem this election is the democrats are out of touch and their message is falling on deaf ears. They keep pushing the status quo and are completely tone deaf in dealing with the issues of many people including millennials. They think pushing more of the same crap is fine. And thats gonna be their downfall. And then we say oh its because people like republicans? Lol.

I know that my intelligence and curiosity are largely cosmic flukes not indicators of the strength of my character. What I also understand is that a truly special teacher realized my brother shouldnt have been shunted into special ed entirely but merely had a learning disability in math. He is capable of basic arithmetic and some geometry but most algebraic concepts are too abstract for him to fully grasp. That is why I bristle when I hear people of perfectly average or higher! intelligence giggling twirling their hair and proclaiming their brains are incapable of figuring out the restaurant tip. If my brother can eke out a C in algebra I so can they.Check out this article in the Atlantic last week It elaborates on your idea that decent employment is fading from view for far too many Americans.

Experiences vary of course but for the most part rural areas tend to have high poverty less job opportunities a less educated populace less entertainment less infrastructure and less diversity and variety. Not to mention levels of gossip intolerance and shaming that wold be impossible in a larger area simply because people couldnt keep track of you that well there. If you fit in completely well with the culture i.e you share the religiousmoral views you plan on reproducing enthusiastically or are a huge fan of outdoorsy activities than they might be a better fit. But for most people theyd just be in a shit area stuck with shit pay at a shit job with little resources or things to do. Lets look at education for instance in the rural high school I attended there were no foreign language classes. None. We couldnt get a foreign language teacher. Likewise with higher math we couldnt offer Calculus or even Trig to the students. And that sort of lack is reflected in many other areas. ,lostgeneration,d9g2xiy,2,t5_2r40j

11005258,0,t1_defexho,ARCHETYPES OF THE CRISISBoomer Gray Champion Elder ProphetsTheir myth is a journey to Owl Mountain a primordial sanctuary preserved since the most ancient times sustaining wisdom passed down from villages in the middle of nowhere speaking to us across the millennia. Clues of what old Boomers will be like can be glimpsed in the conscious aging movement. Cuttingedge books like From Ageing to Sageing speak of new spiritual eldering institutes teaching people to engage in vision quests. These new elders of the tribe see themselves as wisdom keepers who must apply their dormant powers of intuition  to become seers who feed wisdom back into society and who guide the longterm reclamation project of healing our beleaguered planet.Boomer gerontologist Harry Moody sees a twentyfirstcentury shift to a contemplative old age that eliminates todays focus on activity and instead transcends doing in favor of being. Elders will be defined as spiritually gifted over their juniors who are too busy to cultivate the quietness and inwardness from which mystical experience is possible. Pain and bodily decline will be accepted even honored as the necessary burning off of worldly dross for the purpose of acquiring higher insights. In sharp contrast to the youthemulating uninhibited octogenarians of Gail Sheehys Silent Generation these new earth sages will want to be authentically old people critical links in human civilization without whose guidance the young might sink into Philistinismbut with whom the young can craft what gerontologist David Gutmann terms the new myths on which reculturation can be based.As they fill the upper age brackets Boomers will believe themselves to be elders who in the words of anthropologist Joan Halifax function like old cobblers and dressmakers sewing us back into the fabric of creation. They will feel a new transformative dimension of time enabling them to craft myths and models that can resacralize the national community heal its dysfunctions and grant moral authority for the next Golden Age. The very otherworldliness that Boomers will regard so highly in themselves will strike younger generations as evidence of incompetence. Elder contempt for this world will strike younger people as dangerous. Yet regardless what youth think of these old messengers they will respect their message and march to their banner.The full dimension of the Boomer persona will only emerge when todays betterknown s birth cohorts whose youth was marked by relatively few social pathologies are joined in public life by the tougherwilled more evangelical s cohorts whose youth was marked by many more pathologies. That is the mix that will beget this generations elder priestwarrior persona vindicating the preCrisis era.As the Crisis deepens Boomers will confront the end result of their lifelong absorption with values. Their habitual tendency to enunciate unyielding principles will now carry the duty of enforcement. The same Boomers who in youth chanted Hell no we wont go! will emerge as the most martial elder generation in living memory. Whatever the elements of Crisis old Boomer leaders will up the moral ante beyond the point of possible retreat or compromise.X Doom Player Adult NomadsIn a recent genre of action films from War Games and Back to the Future to Terminator and Independence Day a stock drama unfolds. A young protagonistalone unprepared and immersed in a junky cultureis chosen by chance to decide the fate of humanity. The situation looks dicey. The protagonist too has slim expectations of success. But at a pivotal moment this lonely wayfarer challenges destiny deals with the stress zeroes in on what matters does what is required and comes out on top. The most popular video games following the same script stress oneonone action and deft timing Find a treasure grab the tools rescue a princess save the kingdom slay the enemy and get out alive. Everything is yesno full of code words and secret placesin a style one TV executive calls Indiana Jones meets a game show. Ive glimpsed our future warns a high school valedictorian in the film Say Anything and all I can say isgo back.The message to her classmates is understandable because Nomad generationswhat Christian Slater refers to as a long list of dead famous wild peoplehave always been the ones who lose ground in wealth education security longevity and other measures of progress. Yet they have also been the generations who lay at the fulcrum between triumph and tragedy the ones who hoist their society through the darkest days of Crisis.The er mindset will be hardboiled and avuncular the risk taking now mellowed by a Crisisera need for security. Middleaged people will mentor youth movements lend stylishness to hard times and add nutsandbolts workmanship to the resolute new mood. They will be begrudgingly respected for their proficiency in multimedia and various untutored skills to which old Boomers will be blind and young Millennials dismissive. Throughout the economy ers will be associated with risk and dirty jobs. They will seek workable outcomes more than inner truths. We wont have a bad backlash against our lost idealism predicts Slacker filmmaker Richard Linklater since his generation never had that to begin with. Like Hemingway their moral judgments will be situational based on how everybody feels afterward.As the Crisis rages on the eras stark new communitarianism will require ers to rivet new grids in place. Newbreed mayors and governors will abandon old labels and alliances patch together people and technology and rekindle public support for community purpose. Having grown up in a time when walls were being dismantled families dissolved and loyalties discarded er power brokers will reconstruct the social barriers that produce civic order.They will connive first to get the people behind them next to bribe or threaten people into doing whats needed and then to solidify those arrangements into something functional. They wont worry about the obviously insoluble and wont fuss over the merely annoying. Their politicians wont brim with compassion or nuance and wont care if they have to win ugly. To them the outcome will matter more than democracys ritual aesthetics. Their hand strengthened by the demands of Crisis ers will sweep aside procedural legalisms and promises legislated by old regimes.As the Crisis resolves the society will be fully in er hands. If all ends well their securityminded leadership will usher the society away from urgent crusades and into the next High. If not ers will be left with no choice but to yank younger generations by the collar appraise whats left of their society and start anew.Y Power Ranger Young HeroesWhen summoned these ordinary youths transform themselves into thunderbolting evil fighters. Cheerful confident and energetic Power Rangers are nurtured to succeed in the face of great odds. Whatever they dofrom displaying martial arts to piloting hightech weaponrythey do as a choreographed group. Their very motto The Power of Teamwork Overcomes All speaks of strength in cooperation energy in conformity virtue in duty. Their missions are not chosen by themselves but by an incorporeal elder in whose vision and wisdom they have total trust. In social movements they will initially seem pacifist hard to ruffle their civic power as yet untapped. This youthful hunger for social discipline and centralized authority could lead Millennial youth brigades to lend mass to dangerous demagogues.The risk of class warfare will be especially grave if the  percent of Millennials who were poor as children  percent in inner cities come of age seeing their peerbonded paths to generational progress blocked by elder inertia. Unravelingera adults who are today chilled by school uniforms will be truly frightened by the Millennials Crisisera collectivism. Just as the Unravelings political agenda centered around children the agenda of the Next New Deal will center around young adults. Millennials will not oppose this because they will see in it a path to public achievement. National leaders will not hesitate to mobilize and deploy them in huge armies.Near the climax of Crisis the full power of this rising generation will assert itself providing their society with a highly effective instrument for imposing order on an unruly world. They will appear capable of glorious collective deeds of conquering distant lands of potently executing any command that may be issued.As a Crisisera president commits the society to clear a path for a bright future the political juggernaut of Millennial youth will stand squarely with their beloved commanderinchief. This generation of young heroes will follow wherever the Gray Champion leads whether to triumph or disaster. They will vex Hollywoods Unravelingera elite with their cool rationalism. They will vex feminists by accepting a new mystique between the sexes. They will vex free marketeers with their demands for trade barriers government regulation labor standards and public works.Z InnocentsChild welfare will be a settled priority no longer anyones crusade. Protective nurture will be on autopilot. Few adults will dispute that children must be taught community norms often by rote. Children who fall below standards will be warned that the community has ways of remembering that a young persons reputation can be easy to harm but hard to repair.
