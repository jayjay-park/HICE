7385943,0,t3_4ghjtw,Pettyness as soon as something decent comes up on here I have noticed there is always that toxic element. But tbh the rest of you fine folks make up for it. And this is coming from a  total reddit noob haha.,NewChannelCentral,d2hqc0u,1,t5_3dyy6
7440225,0,t3_4h69fn,Honestly theres too many problems with this for anything to really happen. I know of a few websites that exist where you can get views and subs from people. One website I used on a fake account went like thisYou subscribe to people like their videos andor watch their video for  seconds in order for Youtube to verify it as a legit sublikeview. By doing this you get points. Using those points you can advertise your channel. Its like a cycle of cheating and its really pathetic. But unfortunately I think they did everything possible to make sure they werent cheating based on youtubes rules. So although it may be obvious hes cheating I dont think theres really anything we can do about it.,NewChannelCentral,d2nwmas,1,t5_3dyy6
