626017,0,t1_cgbdphs,Theyre saying that the movie will be the Gravity of the Weather. I hope so because of Richard but I didnt really like Gravity at all. At least in your country the movie is going to come out. Here I totally doubt it the cinema companies have something with bringing us only bad movies and the really commercial ones that arent necessarily good movies. And expensive like hell too.,RichardArmitage,cgbfgdn,3,t5_2vv3z

1399908,0,t1_cirqsi6,And were very grateful for it! Im still boggling over the  in there thats just...wow. Very happy to hear the stage door meeting went very well! One of the many things I cant get over with is the bit where you describe the last scene with the kiss and the crying in unison...just imagining it already steals my breath I cant fathom how being there must have actually felt like. Thank you again for these wonderful answers and a heartfelt congratulations on an amazing evening!,RichardArmitage,cirrc0v,1,t5_2vv3z
1731213,0,t1_cjksuw2,gt for much if the book hes consciously opting out of society and amusing himself on his own terms.Yes. Thats another thing that weirded me out. Youre right when you say he didnt set out to be anyones saviour but the smug satisfaction of seeing himself as such seeps out of the narration   these kids didnt even know how to chop vegetables  I showed them how to make curry so that they dont just give themselves indigestion  I feel like there is a strong undercurrent of a weird pleasure in there precisely because he is amusing himself as you say with the situation. Which does not mesh in my mind with him having been a social worker and liking it and all that.I dunno I guess the protagonist being an inefficient nasty bit of goods is as much a theme of the book as the kids are but I cant help feeling that he needs as good slap in the face. Maybe if someone else was to tell me this story a third party that watched both him and the kids there would be more of a balance and less selfindulgence.As for the legacy of Thatcherism and the Northern communities I cant obviously say a thing on the matter. And yes I too would like to see what will Richard do with it but something tells me there will be a good deal of humility added on. Call it a hunch.,RichardArmitage,cjxdu3e,1,t5_2vv3z
