5144764,0,t3_3lfqtq,Last I heard moved to northern MD a few years ago there was an indoor airsoft arena in the Rockville area.  They should probably have a small pro shop that sells guns and BBs and the like.  Not sure what theyre called but a Google search should solve that for you.Alternatively Amazon,MDGuns,cv64xqb,1,t5_31j9k

9034053,0,t1_d7xqbrn,I have been told by some that your prints are good for  hours and some have told me that is no longer the case. I had a place in Laurel promise me that when they called the police they were told your prints no longer expire after  hours but of course I was naturally skeptical of this. ,MDGuns,d7xr0jx,1,t5_31j9k

9460473,0,t3_5a159m,You might get more help for this on rguns or rar.  Not saying theres anything wrong with this sub theres just more people available to help you.  But also make sure you explain that the heavy barrel requirement is mandatory per Maryland law.,MDGuns,d9f6ka0,1,t5_31j9k
9560716,0,t3_5bsrpk,Might be besteasiest to find on Gunbroker or otherwise online and have it shipped to your local FFL.  I bought mine a few years ago got a G version and shaved the handle down myself and that proved to be the easiest way by far.  Also unless you have small hands Id advise getting the G version and some new G mags which will fit in your G assuming youre trying to run a same mag setup between this carbine and your pistol.  You can use the G mags and any rounders you might pick up in everything that way.,MDGuns,d9rjz0r,3,t5_31j9k

10093713,0,t3_5kcw91,Not the best price but pretty fair.  I bought a  hbar DelTon DTI back in  for  off GunBroker.  It came with MOE furniture but the stock was Commerical spec but still really snug and well put together.  It didnt come with a rear sight at the time so I just picked up a cheap Matech buis that worked fine.  You can still build your own though so you dont have to limit yourself to prebuilt.  Edit forgot to add that DelTon has good customer service should you ever need it.  Everytime I reached out to them via phone or email they were always polite and helpful.,MDGuns,dbn85vj,3,t5_31j9k
10466877,0,t1_dcuitm6,Completely agree. Ive been wanting one for a while. I just hate what the price for them has become. I could almost build an AR pistol or rifle for what theyre asking ,MDGuns,dcuizp9,1,t5_31j9k
