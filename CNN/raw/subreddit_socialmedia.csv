68956,0,t3_1uvdk0,Did you just copy and paste a tweet into a reddit selfpost? Thats not a good idea.Social media content is not universal and cannot be simply copied and pasted across all outlets. It is important to tailor the format and content to the media type and technical aspects of the site. For reddit links to the outside world should be just that. Your chance to distinguish the post is through a wellcrafted headline that is relevant to the subreddit and sometimes facilitates discussion on the issues addressed in the link within the reddit posts comments section.Try again! ,socialmedia,cema2zs,3,t5_2qi2m

1348766,0,t3_29ian3,Hey JamesI just signed up.  I think you have a cool idea here but perhaps some rethinking is needed to get it really rolling.  Some specific notes Recommend not requiring a photo before registration.  Some people dont want to add a photo. You need a tutorial or announcement screen or something.  When I first logged in I had no clue what to do. As far as I can tell you have to have a friend to post something.  Yet unless you know someone already joined or have an email address you cant friend someone.  Its a bit like being invited to a private message board but you dont know anyone  and theres no join now button. Im curious why the say something block is limited to  characters.  At that rate not sure anybody would say anything. I posted google.com into the link block and it returned a bunch of css.  Not sure why that happened. If this network is REALLY about content why does the search bar say search for people?Am I right in concluding that if I have no connections selecting all connections to share something means that I am actually sharing it with nobody?I think the better content less mindless chatter concept is a good jumping off point but the way youve implemented it Im not sure it will work.  After all if I want to read great content why should I have to friend someone first?  And putting up barriers to sharing like having to friend first will mean that the network grows much more slowly.  Also if I friend someone do they need to approve my request?When I stand way back from the idea I think friending would be more about following someone with good content  subscribing  than having to share directly with that person.  Who is my audience? And this raises another question motivations for readers and for sharers differ quite a bit  but the friend requirement treats them as if theyre the same.  I think decoupling friending from the sharing of content  perhaps the public pages you mentioned already might be a solution  would simplify and empower users to go their own direction and see who takes an interest rather than having to build an audience first.Hope this helps! ,socialmedia,cilcyj3,7,t5_2qi2m

1446737,0,t1_cixlill,First you have to pay to make larger groups in Meetup.com. Meetup.com also pertains more to hosting longterm weeklymonthly groups where as my app is more about quick. spontaneous ephemeral groups e.g. jam session museum visit pub crawls LAN sessionsparties kind etc.. You also dont need to create an account like in Meetup everything is simply imported through Facebook... much more convenient if you ask me. We also have Reliability Rating and Ranks... Reliability rating is to ensure that whoever joins your group actually attends the group its calculated by dividing the number of groups you actually attend over the number of groups you join e.g. If you went to  groups but joined  youd have an  Reliability Rating. This allows users to filter through users trying to join their group. One would rather have someone with a  Reliability Rating than someone with a  Reliability Rating. You also rank up the more groups you kind of join not incredibly important just interesting and demonstrates the breadth and amount of groups a user has joined. Im trying to make groups as fresh alive and tangible as possible aiming to be the Whole Foods of groups. Im also allowing local businesses universities to promote their services and events for free through GoBe Groups through something called GoBe Promoted page. Imagine owning a bar during a blizzard... instead of giving up hope create a group with an interesting promotion e.g. Title Frosty beer on a frosty day Description  pitchers for weary travelers braving the blizzard. Or imagine owning a pizzeria and making  pictureperfect pizza pies excuse the fun alliteration but theres no one coming into your store... just make a GoBe Group and offer an interesting deal however silly it may be Id sing Its Amore to everyone buying a slice. My app allows for immense creativity and spontaneity all without having to sign up or registering for an account. I also made it so users can invite their friends to their groups even if they dont have the app.  Hope that answers a bit.,socialmedia,cixmhzi,2,t5_2qi2m

Theyd never be an impression or a possible link click so dont worry about it.

Its very easy to talk about what people should do and its another thing to actually do it and get great results. Seems that concepts that seem legit to many authors dont really work in reallife.Generally those that are writing books arent the same people running social strategy at big companies. Instead theyre marketing influencers that are talking to a far different audience and have little connection or experience to what its like to run real social media marketing programs that have to answer to real ROIs.,socialmedia,cxh976x,2,t5_2qi2m
5814070,0,t1_cxen57x,Okay. Im from a football centered country and am an ultra myself as they call it. So I might come off to this from a different angle. But I dont think were talking Social Media in here. I think were talking marketing. What I would do is focus on two groups. Entrepreneurs and fanatic supporters. Entrepreneurs Its fun how entrepreneurs are a group who knows how to get stuff done and get people to come. They know how to and already have succeeded. Start a sponsor group and HIGHLY focus on networking. Show the sponsors theyre not ONLY paying for the sponsored plates next to the field but give them seats. Two per sponsor. Give them a networking event once every month. Will it cost you some drinks some seats and some snacks. Yep. Will they take one new person with them every single match wholl get introduced to the beautiful game? Absolutely. Fanatic supportersIm in a high spot at a fanatic organized group so again I might come off from a weird angle. But look at the football commercials. What do you see? Beautiful goals tough tackles and crowds cheering. Why? Because the atmosphere of football is highly important to loads. How often do I hear that kids mainly like to go to the stadium for the fanatic side. The bad boys screaming and singing. The tension of pyrotechnics and the group who just looks as one huge brotherhood. Give them space. Dont organize too much for them. Just talk a lot with them. What do they want what can you get them. Giving them space to do what they want will only raise their fanaticism. About Social MediaI can give you a huge text about actions hashtags during games retweeting replying but we all know what you should do with social media. Be social. So what can you do different? Follow the banter and join it. Dont be afraid to be joined in rivalism or jokes about beer and stuff like that. The most famous Twitter in the Netherlands is of one of the smallest teams FC Dordrecht. Why are they famous? They sound like theyre one of the supporters in the away pitch. Fun fact for a while they were until he made a joke which the board thought was just a bit too much. And btw dont forget Youtube.Be one of the guys. Be the lad. ,socialmedia,cxhsflc,1,t5_2qi2m

6496034,0,t3_44g99c,You have it right as far as Im concerned.  In my opinion it is imperative to build a community surrounding quality content that provides value.  I think the problem with most business is they dont want to take the time to build up a following and build a relationship with their followers and resort to just pushing their agenda right off the bat.If you look at any successful brand on Instagram they are posting quality content interacting with their followers fostering a relationship and gently advertising in between many posts that arent salesy.Instagram offers the bio link as the only option for a clickable link... which scares many people but in my opinion is an advantage because it makes it less confusing since there is no other distractions and if people want to see more of what you are about they will click it.  If you have an excellent funnel set up and send people there with the bio link you can focus on building a community on Instagram and the amount of clicks into the funnel will naturally grow.I cant tell you the amount of businesses I see on Instagram that post a couple of quote pictures follow a ton of people thinking this will get them quality followers in return and then spend the rest of their time trying to sell to an already unengaged following.  That is a fast road to nowhere IMO.Yes it takes time.  Yes content marketing is becoming saturated across many niches.  Yes you need to be unique and consistent.  But that being said Instagram still offers an incredible opportunity to drive awareness and traffic to a funnel that drives saleslist sign upsreaders etc if its done right.I am currently building a page on Instagram without any agenda except wanting to foster a community of people that like to laugh and be inspired.  I will eventually leverage it to build my list and start to think about monetization once my reach hits k and the organic follows start to flow. Im currently at k and growing everyday.  Having fun too I might add.leonlush,socialmedia,czr8kn4,2,t5_2qi2m

7027604,0,t1_d1cx4pi,I was quite open about it that I posted content. I am new to social media analytics and they had good resources and I also use their service... again I am a fan... full disclosure like I said before. I dont have a formal background in marketing so aside from the books I read Crowdbabble and a few slideshare posts from prominent people are the only resources I like. Initially yes because I was interested in social media analytics but my focus on Reddit has changed to political posts cute cats and TIL... as evident in my post history. On occasion Ill go to social media analytics or post stuff from their blog because I like their content. Otherwise I wouldnt share it. Their resources gave me the confident to freelance consult... I felt someone might be able to do the same with the resources they provide. The economy fucking sucks so this helps pay the bills. Im sorry if it caused a problem. And meh I like the dudes...or dudettes posts who happens to be in the same subreddit as social media analytics. Its a small community and I sometimes I click through to see what else this user posted because she writes case studies for a company I pay  a month to. I want to see what this person has to say. Do you want any more honesty from me? Like what I do when I fail to serve a client? ,socialmedia,d1cxkcr,1,t5_2qi2m

Are your marching orders basically Go post some stuff on Facebook without direction? Are you building an audience or providing customer service to an existing audience? Are you converting customers or educating prospective ones?I dont know the industry so I dont know what any best practices are. But examine your competitors and see what theyre doing if anything. Profile your customersaudience and learn how they engage with content. Do they even do that? Will this be a channel for promotions? Will it be another way to collect data for a mailing list of some sort?Youre overwhelmed because there are a lot of ways social can be tailored to suit your needs. But you must have an understanding of what those needs are while devising a plan a brand voice and a content strategy specific to a platform and how its users interact with it.

7325448,0,t3_4fk69a,There is so much completely and awfully wrong with this article I couldnt just cringe and close...What are you doing spending money on ads when your measure of success is CPC??? Not conversion rate? Cost per lead acquisition?Youre apparently measuring relevance without bringing CTR  bounce  and conversion rate into the conversation?No text on ads because it looks like an ad? Heaven forbid someone clicks on something that looks like an ad and expects to be sold something? You talk about changing images but not targeting or which demos respond better to different types of content or time of day day of week or different headlines on identical content.. Were the ads running concurrently or sequentially? Did you test female vs male images paired with female vs male targeting? You used images of males that you knew to be generic and overused  yet you dont think that played a part? You used bright and airy photos of the women while the dudes are largely in offices and claustrophobic  yet with those sorts of variances in your test subject matter  you think the results have any statistical significance?With  ads and k spend  thats about  per ad and at an average of . per click or thereabouts youre at . clicks per ad. Personally I think thats far too small of a data set to draw meaningful conclusions from especially considering your highly flawed methodology and performance criteria. Getting  irrelevant clicks for k at an infinite cost per lead is a garbage way to advertise a business.

Let me know if I am getting this wrong The easiest way would be to promote your services to small businesses. Ive worked for several who would be happy to pay to get a brandrelated post to the top of any SubReddit. That would be one way of making money through reddit.Alternatively you could insert affiliate links. Top posts get thousands and even millions of impressions. If a fraction clicks your link and makes a purchase you win. Focus on Real Estate and Finance here as they tend to have the highest paying affiliate programs.Finally you could link to your own site from the post and watch some money role in as a percentage click on the banner ads you have placed there.

If a person is rude to you then avoid them. If someone offends you avoid them or even better show them and anyone else interested why your argument is better than their insult.Take your example of a person who thinks that BMW drivers are jerks. Your solution is to ban the person who posts this from your network or otherwise get rid of the comment  your methods are not clear. Alternatively you could have just allowed people to ignore block or defreind this person as a reaction to the opinion on BMW drivers. Your way restricts speech the alternative doesnt.In the end its your social network so you can run it your way but if there is certain speech that is going to be disallowed censored banned or otherwise supressed then your claim to being for freedom of speech is going to be on shaky ground.,socialmedia,d40fwld,1,t5_2qi2m

8002608,0,t3_4ofd7b,A little update on my experiment with no SnapChat for  weeks.One of my friends after going three days without snapchat texted me asking if I was dead.  Im assuming he sent me a snap and noticed it wasnt opened for a lengthy period of time  days so far.  Then they asked if I had delete my snapchat. I am no means popular on this app and only receive snaps from my guy friends but I believe I learned a more valuable lesson here.The lesson I learned in my  days without it is more about self restraint.  I can keep the app and not have to look at the feed.  Although it may be very tempting. I can simply just open it when my friend sends me a snap. As of now I still have the app deleted but probably will redownload it in the next day or two.  BUT I still plan on carrying out my experiment I plan on not viewing any of the feed.I have noticed in my short time of  days without it than I was somewhat more of a happy person.

9018362,0,t3_53pgl7,It works but is it useful?ampnbspDoing it wrongA lot of people think that it is an awesome way to get more followers by following everyone you can and pray for them to follow back but this strategy is just a waste of time and will consume more hours then necessary. The way you present the hack is just too simple and unreliable and might result in a very shitty audience.ampnbspDoing it rightLike with any other thing in business you will need a strategy. The idea behind the hack is great and it works nobody will deny it. However the real trick is to do it right. So before you run out there and start following everyone find a working strategy.ampnbspYour profileUsually people will follow you back because they feel obligated to do so which means they might not even engage with your posts. You will end up with thousands of followes and only tens of likes on your content. So in order to get the really juciy guys you should clean up your profile a bit make sure all the content fits your brands narrative and is interesting and engaging enough. Try to get the bias out of your head and look at your profile cirtically and see if you would personally follow your own profile.ampnbspThe executionAll social media platforms are driven by engagement. I dont care what other people say. The essence of social media is sharing and reacting to content. So this strategy will work on almost any platform that has a like share and follow button. I also assume you know your target audienceStart searching for the right people. Look for people that share the same hashtags you do people that are interested in the same things and check out their profiles. If this is a profile you would personally follow engage with some content on their profile and then follow them.If they see your name popping up several times in their notifications they are more likely to check out your awesome and organised profile which hopefully will lead to them following you.ampnbspHonest opinionLet others critise the shit out of your profile before you start a followfollow campaign. Make sure your profile is appealing. If yoi truly like how your profile looks you can start a campaign.This is not a new hack it is psychological trick and a lot of social media marketers try to perfect it in their way. It is also universally applicable as long as you do it on a social media platform. Play a bit with the stuff and see how it will work out. Good luck with that.,socialmedia,d7vv6wy,1,t5_2qi2m

You also want to build a community of loyal fans people you currently know family friends etc. could most likely be a part of this  you can download CSV files from LinkedIn andor your email program and upload them to your Facebook Page make sure you read the latest SPAM info before doing so. I found adding my current contacts to be a great way to build up the number of likes.

9886484,0,t3_5gz4df,I was studying and started my own online shop selling shoes. I developed a digital strategy including social for my shoe business. Learned and used tools like Photoshop Illustrator InDesign video editing made some clips on my DSLR Adwords Facebook Ads Analytics etc.... I completed a frontend development course and built some static websites not necessary but being able to code did help in my interview and I also made sure I understood marketing concepts like according to Brian Balfour.Data Analysis   Understanding the meaning of data to identify understand and pinpoint solutions..Quantitative Modeling    Translating your historical data into a forward looking model to simulate the future which helps you understand better what you should be doing today..User Psychology  The data doesnt matter unless you know how to influence the numbers in an authentic way.  That comes down to understanding the psychology of your audience problem and solution to figure out what your users respond to. .Storytelling After the success with my online shop I helped two other small local companies develop and implement strategies. I then made a portfolio highlighting the successes I had. Applied for jobs and I now work as a digital marketer for a tech company.Just a note smaller companies might not need a dedicated social marketer just yet so knowing about digital marketing and traditional marketing helped me get my job.Also no job is just fun from beginning to end although you enjoy social media marketing there might be parts of your job you dont enjoy as much you still have to do it and deliver. ,socialmedia,daw8d0k,5,t5_2qi2m

Your story and brand must be aware to the market for market to appreciate. Look at any large industry player Coke Verizon Nike Underarmour etc. and they are vastly successful because of theyre brand awareness. Another example would be DJ Khalid.

Another thing to mention is that I like sending personal stories to friends and having the privacy I do not get with other channels.

ESPN uses Facebook comments and many articles have hundreds of comments with several long threads included. Voicing your opinion in a few of those comment threads would likely be fine.Another way to use these comment sections is to just add the users as friends if you are using a profile vs page and use a customized message andor invite them to a group using a customized message.The latter is the way that I have used this for campaigns in the past.

This was with a mid level  digit budget. At the end of the day your costs will depend more on your audience when using either objective.  If you care about reachfrequency and controlling the amount of times a user is exposed to your brand I would go reach.
