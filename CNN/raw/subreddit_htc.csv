195405,0,t1_cf0hdnw,I believe you meant well lose some part of the screen. However youre not really losing anything. The screen will get larger to cover the space the buttons would have taken OR the device will get smaller  both good things. Also they onscreen buttons go away when you dont need them like watching a movie in apps etc which means you have more of the total surface area of the phone dedicated to viewing. It makes for a more compact device relative to screen size.,htc,cf0p4wi,2,t5_2rjy3

2079003,0,t1_cl41u5z,ok so what they showed us has already been shown except for the fact that with the whole cropping thing you can do a lot more than just crop yourself out of the front cam and put you in the back cam. you can for example take a stock picture of the eiffel tower or the taj mahal or anywhere really and then take a video of yourself and crap the video into the stock photo so it looks as if youre actually at the place. then you can post consecutive videos on facebook from all over the world and your friends will have no clue whats going on.,htc,cl434up,1,t5_2rjy3

3326639,0,t3_2xkz72,Hmm I started with the Windows Mobile devices on Sprint working with the PPC through my tech support job and got my first one as the Cingular  the HTC Wizard  years ago. I then got the  TyTN on ATampT the HTC EVO G on Sprint and most recently the HTC One S on TMobile wt for HTCs first solid aluminum unibody design and unlimited highspeed data!. The HTC One Ms design was very striking. The One M I didnt like  they rounded the corners too much for my taste and the brushed aluminum did not look as good as the anodized aluminum of the M which perfectly matched my Dell XPS Ultrabook My TMobile contract is now up and to say a lot has changed in the cellular industry would be a huge understatement.I can no longer get phones at the regular two year one price upfront discount like I had for  years before that which means new flagship phones cost A LOT of money up front the  and EVO ran me a modest tax before and the One S I got for free on activation for porting from Sprint. The one M is now  down plus monthly payments on TMobile which is bullshit. I cant afford a One M through TMobile and the design isnt really appealing too me far too close to the M. I would really like the Desire Eye but it doesnt support most of TMobiles bands and  is too much to spend on something that doesnt support all of the frequencies I need. Honestly this will be the first time in a long time I havent had some HTC device on hand but Im really looking forward to the BlackBerry Passport. It has all of my Android apps I tested them instore at ATampT supports both ATampT and TMobile bands has a fantastic capacitive touch keyboard and the screen resolution and size is perfect for web browsing. I guess I will see what HTC has in a couple of years when I get ready to upgrade again. ,htc,cp7gqar,1,t5_2rjy3

9596010,0,t1_d9vug76,The features make the phone. A touch screen is a feature. G LTE connectivity is a feature. A headphone jack is a feature. And speakers are a feature. You buy your phones based on the best features that you can get for the best price.Obviously those are features but theyre necessary features. Things like HeartRate monitors IR blasters gimmicky addons that arent really that convenient or helpful can get in the way of the things that should be. Features arent really required.The reason why the Pixel is so controversial is because even though its a good phone its incredibly expensive for how few features you get. If you think features dont make the phone then I challenge you to go back to a flip phone for a month.Granted it seems like a steep price but look at the quality of the phone itself. A good phone has gotta be sturdy reliable and work well with no exceptions. Instead of focusing on features theyve put their efforts into improving the quality of what they already have.People have consistently said that they are okay sacrificing a little bit of bezel for front facing speakers or a little bit of thinness for extra battery. HTC used to be the innovators giving us the features we wanted or didnt know we wanted. Now theyre backpedaling. And whats worse is they arent giving us anything to make up for it. Just look at the gigantic chin on the Pixel. If you think HTC has been making the right calls then look again at the sales of the M or the  compared to the other phones that came out then or just wait until this phone is released and watch and see.Did people ask for front facing speakers with the M? Nobody thought about it until they innovated it. But with the growing demand for fingerprint security they wanted to give their customers something thats becoming more of a standard on flagships than a feature. To give their customers that important improvement they had to sacrifice the speakers. And while yes the MM sound better with their speakers they added the bit DAC. Even then they still have dual speakers.How can you possibly say they dont try and make up for the changes theyve made. Look at the front facing camera with OIS. Look at the DxO mark rating for the rear camera. Its one of the highest rated cameras for overall performance color accuracy etc. Look at the structural integrity of the aluminum body. Sales reflect very little about phone quality.,htc,d9vwk8z,2,t5_2rjy3

10585460,0,t3_5rjhlp,i thought they offered a full  year warranty even accidental on its phones. Personally I bought a second hand htc m used it for like  months then my brother used it for like  months. Then it developed a software issue that not even the att store could fix. I couldnt even ROM it. So i called HTC and they said it was out of the  year warranty. But they sent me a survey to review my experience needless to say it was a negative one. I left my info on the survey. They contacted me again the next day the HTC specialty team or something. So they said they would take a look at the phone but need to know that physical damage wasnt the reason for that issue. So i sent in the phone at cost. They are pretty honest about trying to make you happy. It took them like  days to fix and I had it back on the th day.They paid return shipping and comped fixing the phone. I used it for like  more year and then flipped it on ebay. Phone worked flawlessly since repair battery was just dying downI definitely think they are customer service orientated. I think if you buy a phone you should not be scared at all that first year call and ask about it cant hurt tbh. After the warranty period it can be a little bit of a hit and miss but still probably better than LG. I think theyre trying to be more apple like its just they dont have physical locations as far as i know so it has to be mailed in.,htc,dd7t4lu,3,t5_2rjy3
