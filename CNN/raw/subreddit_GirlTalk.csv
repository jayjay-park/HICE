1445574,0,t3_2apf9y,Aw thats basically the set up to the first date I had with my now husband. A friend and I over analyzed the situation as  year olds are prone to do. We determined that it was only a date if he went out of his way to pay for something. He did and it was. I realize that thats a bit simplistic and relies on cultural preferences. As for the mama bear I had a papa bear. I lied to my parents a lot or just omitted details so I dont have any advice on how to be a good kid about the situation. Mine were typically okay with me dating as long as they met the boy first but I sometimes felt like that put too much pressure and awkwardness on it. Maybe if you dont spring it on her and give her time to meet him it will go more in your favor. Good luck with your kind of date! ,GirlTalk,cixh946,3,t5_2s6lj
1553246,0,t3_2byaw1,Hes not really your friend. Is he really a nice guy and a friend if the only reason he is being your friend is so you will sleep with him? Kindness coins ! sex owed. I would ditch him. Its not being mean at all.,GirlTalk,cjaz15e,1,t5_2s6lj

4811894,0,t1_cu12i6n,Thanks for the thoughtful reply. It is good to hear all these things from someone else. I am doing many of the things you recommend and Im looking forward to when my social life feels full and rich enough for mewhich I hope ends up happening. But again getting the acknowledgement is validating. Its also good to hear about it working out. Cheers.,GirlTalk,cu12v1w,1,t5_2s6lj
