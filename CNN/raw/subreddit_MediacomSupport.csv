Im not trying to say that its certainly your wireless but its a possibility Id like to eliminate if possible. As for wireless do you have separately named .GHz and GHz wireless networks. If its a linksys and its still set to default you might have a YourNetwork and YourNetwork.media or YourNetwork GHz with your network name. In my apartment building the .GHz wireless speeds are genuinely terrible because of all the wireless routers stepping all over each other. My GHz wireless is perfect but I had to name them differently so that I could only connect to the GHz.,MediacomSupport,db38jsx,1,t5_393ai
