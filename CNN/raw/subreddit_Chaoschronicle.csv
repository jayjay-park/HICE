8670802,0,t3_4yn0mg,. Ceasar is a pretty decent tank . Ceris very good mage . Lone has nice dmg for his active skill just gotta make sure his final atk from his active hits.. Canna is decent with her ability to heal and reduce skill CD. For Gloin make sure to get some Decrease MP items and he should be fineTeam is pretty good but at some point you may want to add an archer class in there.,Chaoschronicle,d6pgyvj,1,t5_3fraz
8682695,0,t3_4ywog7,Its very grind heavy but honestly really the drop rate is really bad from the currency.  So you really wouldnt be making of a difference.  The only way this game would be skewed toward PP is if they start selling subjugation tickets for rubies.  Then I would say its unfair.If you like the gameplay and you want to go FP it is fine.,Chaoschronicle,d6qyn4d,2,t5_3fraz

8992504,0,t1_d7sbomp,Hey thank you for the feedback. That is actually a great idea. It would be nice to have a section for stage strategy and various team compositions. If Im not mistaken all of the Chapters follow the same monster patterns for each chapter.,Chaoschronicle,d7srdfp,2,t5_3fraz
9078702,0,t3_54lrdf,You guys dont know the problem still ?The problem is that the enemies in Arena have boosted skills during defending including your own team when somebody fight you.We figured out that AI Zached burn power isnt bugged its just that every enemies Zached seems to have lv  active skill. This is further proven by my Ash with  elite weapon that does less damage than any other Ash I had faced at .Enemies Ceris also show CD reduction of  seconds which means rd skill is max even though when you check their teams it only shows lv  or lv  which should be  sec  secs respectively.You cannot outdamage the AI enemies. Cancelling skills is what you must do. The CDR gears spreading across your team has to be planned perfectly and this needs lots of trials and errors testing. The positions of your chars from front to back affects the outcome greatly.  For example if you leave Chris at the rear he wont be canceled by enemies Zached grenade because he will walk up and the th position of your team will take the grenade. There are many more tricks that the top guys are not sharing... I have a  winrate and sitting at  points already for this week it can be done.I said so many times to ppl that having your own Zached doesnt mean you will be Arena god. Against some set up I actually have to take off Zached in order to win because of how she is positioned when you put her in the team.Dont copy the popular set up because going into battles with identical team to the enemies you basically just tossing a coin there.,Chaoschronicle,d8342dw,2,t5_3fraz

9414688,0,t3_59hvso,You have Verid Violet and Demona! I am jelly.I tend to use the  star dupes to skill level. I would use trash  stars to uncap. If you are going through the trouble of ranking up your  star dupes to  star you may as well transcend them. Then again I am still fairly new to the game so take my advice with a grain of salt.,Chaoschronicle,d99dlfd,1,t5_3fraz
9515867,0,t1_d9j5u7z,May I ask what other games do you know that have this trading mechanic? Im coming from freemiums that have the use N units where N is the number of stars to evolve the unit you need and still relies in gachas to actually obtain new units Ive found myself wishing the other freemiums I play used this trading mechanic as it actually improves my chances of getting better heroes.Cheers!,Chaoschronicle,d9m17pc,1,t5_3fraz

9961624,0,t3_5i5tau,Poporu and Dagon that means you only have  slots for reliable CC heroes. Karfel is not one of those thats where your problem is.Replace Karfel with a CC hero. Baham is great and pretty easy to skill up. Ash is good. Aeris is another option cause you have to invest in her for the Arena anyway. ,Chaoschronicle,db60xhb,1,t5_3fraz

10136531,0,t3_5l430m,Id probably go for something likeStage Zached Dagon Elfina Ceris Aeris  If youre having trouble Yacheol with enough Evasion can tank stages through  normal and like  hard without a healer allowing you to get more dps mostly for the  star.PvP Yacheol PegasusIf you get enough evasion onto Yacheol you wont really need him. In that case pick another one of the end options Zached Aeris CerisKellainElfinaTheodrin  The current meta is centered around Chris being able to counter Zached. If you come up against a Chris that you cant avoid add Kellain. Chris is usually going to be your opponents weakest character because he doesnt have much use in the game outside of countering Zached. I added Theodrin because he too can counter Zached although it doesnt always work. If your opponent doesnt have Aeris Ceriss spec will likely go off which ends the game. Otherwise Elfina is probably your best bet because she is pretty consistent. For Arena Id focus on getting gear with Cooldown Reduction for Zached Aeris Yacheol and Theodrinshould you choose to use him.Manatech Tower is a game of consistency. If you are unable to cancel all or almost all of the skills youll be in trouble. There are also too many opponents to go without a healer. Elfina will be your most important tool. Then youre looking for a tank and allhit skills. Like I mentioned before Yacheol is able to tank and has an allhit skill. If youre having trouble making the time requirement try swapping him out for Dagon who is able to draw out more opponents at a time. In addition to your tank and healaer youll want allhit dps units. Id recommend Zached Ceris and Aeris but other dps units work. Many people also like Lone in particular. ,Chaoschronicle,dbsslp3,2,t5_3fraz

11040275,0,t1_dejbz7j,Ranking equipment requires  of the same weapon both enhanced to . Once you have them both maxed they will show up in each others rank up menu. Or you can use rank up stones if you have them but regular weapons are easy enough to acquire doubles of. Elite weapons get tricky. ,Chaoschronicle,deje99s,1,t5_3fraz
11057556,0,t3_5xj628,All heroes are worth keeping just in case the meta change.  Damon has been meta since the charger change and will be continuing forward.  I would save the  Damon for transcending.  Theres also a little known bug where if you uncap a hero with the same hero whos on its second transcend you can make the nd skill .  Unfortunately that means you need to keep your Damon with at one locked accessory until you get him to  with  transcends.  ,Chaoschronicle,delct6p,1,t5_3fraz
