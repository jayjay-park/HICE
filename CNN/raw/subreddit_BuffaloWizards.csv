7782524,0,t1_d3qspjw,Definitely a fair bit of a learning curve involved for the DM yes. While I still describe URealms as being a boileddown version of DampD the focus is shifted heavily and combat works almost entirely differently  in URL you basically only miss an attack on a roll of  or less though sometimes youll only get halfdamage on sub rolls but your damage is a guaranteed flat value when you do land a hit. DampD is completely the opposite  you can miss on attacks with somewhat high rolls even and when you do hit your damage can vary quite widely. For an example in URealms if I want to cast Fireball I just roll a D and see what I get. Lets say I roll a   thats probably going to hit for full damage  total. In DampD if I cast Fireball there a level three spell first obtainable by sorcerers and wizards at character level  it has a guaranteed hit against a target area with a foot explosion radius and targets in the area have to attempt a Dexterity saving roll to dodge the attack. Anything caught in the blast takes d damage which means the damage can vary from as low as  to as high as  per target hit and takes half damage even if they successfully dodge the blast a range of  to  damage. Spells usually put the burden of dodging on the target as opposed to burden of hit on the caster since in DampD your usage of magic is much more limited than in URealms.,BuffaloWizards,d3qt3sn,2,t5_31e75

10114683,0,t1_dbp6ome,DB was a medusa which if you recall the noncanon campaign Many Gobos of Pat an entire fighting ring was orchestrated by one. The medusa in that one basically created an entire army by herself for one mission. Theyre not the type of characters to directly orchestrate something but tell others what to do. If DB had the ability to tell Rob what Krungor could do it would have been great but I think Rob had good plans for Krungor and DB would have been  trying to improv something cool while Rob would have had certain attacks thought in advance. Either way DBs characters policy of dont get the hands horn dirty unless you need to fits well into the medusa character.,BuffaloWizards,dbpy9oe,2,t5_31e75
