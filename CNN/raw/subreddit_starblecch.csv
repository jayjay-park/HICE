2750316,0,t1_cngp3jl,Star Wars is a fantasy story set in space. Swords wizards magic princess to rescue the whole  yards. Some even say the Death Star was the fire breathing dragon Luke had to slay. I love it.Star Trek is about humanity traveling in space hence the name. It has more science and speculative science fiction in it than Star Wars. in fact SW has always made a point to stay away from techno jargon and explanations. ST is all about it. I love it too. In other words I love apples AND oranges I just dont confuse one for the other ,starblecch,cngp6r0,2,t5_2x0fq
