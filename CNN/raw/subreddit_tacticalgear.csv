3731809,0,t1_cqh62tz,Sure  So first off I was wrong its m thats the issue.  That particular round travels at normal velocities over k fps inside of  yards.  At that rate they tend to punch holes in plate steel rather than dent and fracture.  So a common milsurp ammo in a very common AR pattern rifle in distances further away than home defense scenarios provides some questions to reliability.  AR has some videos regarding their pieces stopping this particular threat inside  yards  so there is info out there.  Just be an informed buyer and know what threats youre really looking at facing.  To put it simply the major disadvantage of steel plates are weight.  .lb doesnt seem like a lot per plate but when you double it up and add lbs plus all the stuff you carry on your rig it can add up.  Not to mention steel tends to be a little less ergonomic and less comfortable than ceramic.   The general consensus with plate carriers is less is more.  There are some diagrams around that show how to properly carry armor and what it shoudl cover.  Its essentially only for vital organs lungs heart backbone  everything else is sacrificed.  Kevlarsoft armor is usually only carrier in side pockets in cummerbunds and even then a lot of people opt to not use it.  Hope that helps!,tacticalgear,cqhnezu,2,t5_2vso4

8410170,0,t1_d5sjojt,First never claimed to be an expert.Second if you read the end of my first paragraph youll see where I said that Im operating on the assumption that OP is LEO or first responder.If OP isnt LE or the organizations sexurity youre absolutely right.  Probably not a stellar idea to suit up in tac gear to respond to an active shooter.  And if he is security he definitely needs to have some coordination w local LE in place BEFORE anything happens.TLDR If youre not a copauthorized security dont suit up for battle unless you want to run a super high chance of getting yourself shot.,tacticalgear,d5stdmy,2,t5_2vso4

9054847,0,t3_53ssju,Just as an fYI. Not sure what your current armor set up is but I know that if you take any standard LEO soft armor level  or  you can normally fit the hard armor into the carrier that is standard if you want to wear it under your uniform. Ive tried it and I know a few guys I work with who are uniformed LEOs who wear it like that everyday. They dont use a special carrier at all. Just the standard one that comes with the soft armor,tacticalgear,d808xs8,1,t5_2vso4
9323426,0,t3_584qot,Personally a fan of the milspec monkeytactical tailor adapt pack. Its an extremely versatile and adaptable hour pack. It can be used as an assault pack and mate with many swift clip chest rigs like a HSP DCR or can mount to a plate carrier. It can also be used as a standard  strap bag or a sling bag. It even as a pocket design to hold a holster for a CCW.,tacticalgear,d8xt9ki,1,t5_2vso4

So short term engagement  LBV  Chest rigLong term wear and  or long distance marched while wearing gear  older style harness.Also not all harnesses are A.L.I.C.E. there are several M.O.L.L.E. versions,tacticalgear,d9w7ihz,3,t5_2vso4

10728123,0,t1_ddmiavb,Lots of good suggestions thank you. The boots are basically brand new less than  miles on them so Im hoping they break in and I can lace them tighter for better ankle support. Ive heard good things about those ear muffs and they will be on the list when I have the funds available. With all the other more in my humble opinion important things i need to round out my kit a helmet is pretty low on the list but it is on the list nonetheless.,tacticalgear,ddmixss,3,t5_2vso4
10857738,0,t1_ddz4tug,a few nitpicks the ops core is lighter then the airframeIf lightness is your goal an ECLAN is a bad call. you can get cheaper and lighter x scopes or maybe an aimpoint micro  magnifier. but given that the weapon is a mk just an aimpoint micro is probably fine. Lancer Mags are lighter then PMAGS and about the same price. Also you can drop a lot of weight on MREs by breaking them down or taking less.  is a bit excessive imo one can last a day easy enough.  You can get lighter suppressors and weapons too but if youre keeping it milspec then thats fair. ,tacticalgear,ddzwdm9,2,t5_2vso4

11705314,0,t1_dglmumt,Modularity. The Gcode belt uses a proprietary mount system. You have to buy the Pr clips for your Gcode pouches.  Their system is not to spec with PALS so molle pouches fit sloppy. And if you change systems your Gcode pouches wont fit Pals properly without purchasing molle conversion. The Gcode operator belt is  and you still need Gcode pouches with proprietary rp clips that they charge  for when you buy a pouch.The AWS belt with  lab panels  columns of molle to true pals spec is also .  Im going AWS everytime. Youre allowed to disagree. Thats the beauty of choices ,tacticalgear,dgmti8h,2,t5_2vso4
