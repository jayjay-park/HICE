There are a lot of glove vendors but EmazingLights KeK and OLS are where I hear most people get their lights Prewires will break really fast and then you have to buy a new set Go Microlights. Gloving is a lot more work than you would guess just looking at it ive taken  different people to teach them and when it comes to the drive to practice on their own they give up an over the top amount of rude people starting out and at the point you start to be decent its a skill with no other applications in life. But the look in someones eyes when you give a truly fantastic show makes it worth the endless practice and conditioning. Also later on when you want to get different diffusers than what comes standard go domes its the one i see the most people using and my favorite for comfort on hands and finger mobility,gloving,cjqsl7b,6,t5_2sy2d

2249045,0,t3_2kk765,I like to let my gloves get dirty until I take them to a show. I order a new pair around the same time so within a couple days of the show I can switch the lights to the new gloves. Its my own little ritual I do after every show.While Im change out the lights I reflect on the show all the people I met my rave fam that I cherish and the joyous time I had soaking up the bass and channeling it through my lights.Its my way of taking myself back to the memories Ill cherish the rest of my life. Ill admit I never remember the entire night but when I take the lights out of those dirty gloves the amazing people I met and experiences I had shine brighter in my mind than any LED ever could.Finally when the last light is placed into the new gloves I look at the pristine white cotton and I know these gloves may be destined to sweat dirt  and tearing but theyre also going to be a part in one of the best nights of my life.This is just what I like to do with my gloves maybe give it a try sometime.,gloving,clppd44,0,t5_2sy2d

5597374,0,t3_3rqs84,I was the same way! I wanted to have a complete set of unique moves right off the bat so I actually didnt watch a ton of videos so that I couldnt be tempted to just steal moves. You should watch tutorial videos to get an idea of the basics but I would advise against watching project videos and trying to learn other glovers moves. If you put in a bunch of time in the lab coming up with your own sequences you will end up with moves that other people arent doing. Youre in a good position where youre new and havent been conditioned yet to do the same shit everyone else is doing. So if youre serious about being unique take advantage of the fact that youre a fresh slate and just put in the time. Take video of yourself and watch those videos so you can memorize YOUR OWN moves. Btw I found it easiest to come up with sequences by focusing on the cause and effect style. Its easier to remember the sequences because the next move just makes sense the previous move determines the next move.,gloving,cwqwol4,1,t5_2sy2d

If you are anxious you are living in the future.  If you are at peace you are living in the present  Lao TzuLet gloving be that tuning fork to the present when your mind feels and thinks and desires nothing but the music and moves you make.

Unless youre talking about more of a strobe effect then its a mode in the more expensive gloves. You should be able to get the same effect if you just practice conjuring and timing your elites. ,gloving,dei8rp1,2,t5_2sy2d

11772970,0,t3_67y4ji,I have exactly the same questions as you. Once all my Hub batteries ran out I just said fuck it and went back to my Element V couldnt be bothered to buy more and probably wont until they update the app.Speed only has two sequences so the inclusion of the second slider is confusing. The way I seem to think it works is that the bottom slider determines when it will switch from seq to seq and the top slider determines how quickly it switches back. Oviously the first slider is sequence change but with only two sequences thats all you need.But honestly I made a whole test glove set of varying and calculated sensitivities across the modes and didnt learn anything other than Flux is a little bit broken. I tried both at the bottom both at the top one at the top and one at the bottom both in the middle one half way and one not so on and so on. I couldnt figure it out.,gloving,dguhzs5,1,t5_2sy2d
