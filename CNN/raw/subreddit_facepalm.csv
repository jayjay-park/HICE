3765,0,t1_ceeu1so,gtgt Useful predictions. Cant test thisgt I for one find it very useful in determining what to doOk I got something wrong there. Its not even a prediction its just another claim. It doesnt logically follow that when you get reincarnated you get the body that you deserve for how you behaved in an earlier life. How is good and bad evaluated here how is it determined that you get a stronger body or get born crippled? Thats not a prediction which logically follows from the claim that people get reincarnated its just another claim. And what I ment when I said useful prediction but I should have worded this differently is that you need predictions which you can use to verify the claims. You can talk about how conforting it is to know that bad people get punished in the end anyway and how people who you think where born inferior or in lower classes dont deserve your help anyway not saying that you do this but that kind of worldview actually does logically follow from the claim yougetwhatyoudeservereincarnation and is still widespread in the far east. But all those things dont matter if you cant proove that reincarnation happends in the first place.gtgt Of course there is. an end to they chaingt No there is not. So.. why DOES quantum mechanics work the way it does ?Lets get back on track here. I asked you why youd need a soul to explain similarities between more closely related people if this phenomenon can already be explained better with DNA. You didnt answer but you started talking about the whychain for whatever reason. So whats your point here? Is your buddhismtheorythingy save from asking Why? over and over again? gt Youre again putting words in my mouth.I just dont get your point then. We dont know why quantum mechanics behaves the way it does we might find out more in the future only to hit the next wall of thats just the way things are like we did for hundreds of years. But were still using quantum mechanical effects to watch movies in D. It still works. So what has the whychain to do with wheter or not and how DNA works? gt As a thought experiment I mentioned a scientific although complex method to verify such claims..I guess you mean thisgt And it is clearly falsifiable. The theory states for example if you cut off another mans leg you will be born without one. You speak to a person in a closed room record the conversation make him practice the mentioned austerities to learn previous birth memory recollection amp human birth reincarnation make him cut off another mans leg wait for him to die and be reborn find the child that is able to exactly recall above recorded conversation check if the child has both legs. If he does theory is false.Easy after a major battle with lots of hacking off of bodyparts the next few days should be full of newly born childern with missing bodyparts. If the experiment you describle would actually work you wouldnt need to do it yourself youd just need to keep track of what kinds of disabilities  birthmarks etc people are born with and compare it to the injuries that people inflict on each other. There should be lots and lots of correlation to be found here even just with ruff numbers.,facepalm,ceev72c,1,t5_2r5rp

13901,0,t1_ceg0e1u,First homework which I never heard college kids call anything but whatever certainly doesnt need to be graded. The professor may want to show the class data about how they view an issue before that issue is explored and discussed.  Second if the problem is as I speculated that the student has no internet access and therefore has to use an intermediary anyway it may be that she cares a great deal but cant feasibly do it herself in the timeframe required.  As I said before no one knows what is going on here. But realize that youre now mirroring the same wellpoisoning comments that OP made. And no reasonable person would believe that these few lines of text are enough to draw an informed opinion about this woman.  Im not saying shes a saintshe may be a horrible person.

She was the one stupid enough to put them online right?Theres no difference between that and this. People CAN get images of themselves off of the internet.

We had a soldier come into the unit later down the road who practiced Wicca.  He had his religion put onto his dog tags but when he attached a Pentacle the same as Christians were doing with crosses around his neck he got shit for it and was told to remove it.I can only shake my head at those who announce that Christianity is being attacked in the civilian and military world because to me its not that but rather the floor is becoming more open to the fairness of any religion and Christianity is starting to lose the hard grip it had on a lot of aspects of control it once carried.This to me  was a prime example that its still the dominant religion and has a little too much control which takes away the fairness people want and expect.,facepalm,cf0c5jy,1,t5_2r5rp

605505,0,t1_cg8q211,gt junior high when my buddies and I started smoking we would drop a light cigarette between our forearms that were pressed against each other.  First one to pull their arm away lost. Lol that brings back memories. I think we were freshman in HS when we did that. Stupid yes but I got an angle that actually makes it kind of special. My best friend from elementary school on was killed years later. Always haunts me because we had both joined the Army and if I had gone B like him basic infantry we would have been stationed together. But I didnt see a future post Army with infantry so I went a different route. We got stationed different places him Ft Stewart in Georgia and me Ft Hood in Texas. He was killed a year or two later and its always haunted me that if I had done infantry maybe I wouldve been by his side and he wouldnt have been killed. I mean I loved him as a brother. My whole family loved him. He was family. Anyway back to the point we did that cigarette between the arms thing in th grade or freshman year of high school. We had one particular one where neither would give and we both got majorly burned and blistered up. I have an obvious scar from that now but I kind of love it. Its a reminder lifelong of my friend and all the good times we had. Maybe that seems stupid but I look atrub it whenever he comes up or I think of fun. Sorry to sidetrack there. Other games we played were slap boxing got a great story there too body boxing only body shots allowed or a game we called blow for blow. Basically take turns hitting the other person in the arm as hard as you can until someone cant take anymore and gives up. So many great memories. I lived in a real poor neighborhood in the DC suburbs. They call then suburban urban pockets. Lot of drugs lots of folks from everywhere and a lot of gang violence from the Hispanics we had people from everywhere the biggest gang repped was probably th Street from LA. They like most other Hispanic gangs in the area beefed with MS. Probably the biggest highlight from that was them meeting MS across the street one night in the library parking lot why they built a library there has already baffled me. Anyway MS showed up in a van and then jumped out with machetes. Me and my friends were friends with the neighborhood gangs but that wasnt our thing so we were just watching. Anyway the neighborhood locals were caught by surprise with the machetes and had no answer and took off. Unfortunately they caught one and no lie caught his fucking arm off almost completely through. I think the blood stains are still there  years later. I remembered when the police tried to put up cameras high up on the local lampposts. I think every single one was shot out with a BB gun within the hour. Sorry Im dragging on here. Just dont get many chances to talk about it these days. You know we were all poor our home lifes sucked most like myself from broken homes but that neighborhood was special. About  years ago they ran everyone out and tore it down how many suburban neighborhoods do you hear about getting torn down? Like I said unique special place. ,facepalm,cg93kx1,1,t5_2r5rp

926549,0,t1_ch9lgnx,maybe you were just a bad server? the world is trying to run as efficiently as possible and no one is trying to feel entitled to your hard earned money. however youre expected to pay for the true cost of your meal. if the restaurant industry is tacking on a  discount on your meal prices at the expense of their employees just so we have the option to decide whether they earned the remaining value then we shouldnt abuse it. this system keeps the industry disciplined and weeds out the goodbad but if we all decided to fuck the system then we would see that  markup come right back.all im saying is that its not a phantom or a made up cost. regardless whether tipping exists or not youll pay  for your steak either menu cost  taxes or menu cost  taxes  tip. at least with tipping you can hold your waiter accountable.also ive never been a server or busser. this is just common sense.,facepalm,ch9lqju,1,t5_2r5rp

930899,0,t1_ch9wv2m,No  is above the federal tipped and regular wage its . in the United States. And yeah people can live on that.People in the United States have a higher purchasing power than you do in Australia in some parts of the country you can buy a house for . Things like gasoline do you call it petrol? and milk cost less here due to government subsidies. And in other places in the country things cost significantly more but the state minimum wages are often higher to compensate. I think Californias is pretty high somewhere around ?.For example one of the reasons you pay more for video games than Americans is because your minimum wage is set higher than ours close to double. Same reason region pricing puts the MSRP of video games and movies much lower in places like China or Taiwan their wages are lower.And theres countries like Germany where there isnt a minimum wage at all the assumption is that the market will correct itself and that labor is strong enough to advocate for a fair wage. So while I understand where youre coming from it must seem unfathomably low haha its not quite so simple to just convert Australian dollars to American. Australian nominal GDP per capita is higher than the United States but your PPP purchasing power parity GDP per capita is lower. The US is also quite protectionist of some industries which skews the numbers a bit as well.,facepalm,cha3j0c,2,t5_2r5rp

936282,0,t1_cham441,An entertaining childish argument wherein you refuse to even acknowledge that the tipping system is absurd to anyone not intertwined within it. The point being made here is that just because this system is relied upon doesnt make it remotely sane. I tip what I tip you tip what you tip. If you would like the waiter to bring you a nice glass of White Knight lager you can sit there  shut the fuck up and drink it. But youre paying for it. I tip what I think is fair usually north of . If the guy next to me tips  it makes him no more less a customer and no less worthy of the time it takes to serve him. He doesnt buy into the system because hes got bigger balls than me to look waitstaff in the eye after he does it. Im a socially anxious person the notion of offending my waiter means more than the money. I dont like the system and if a waiter ever balked at my tip Id zero it out in front of them and I have. But until that point Ill worry about looking cheap and coldhearted. Now why dont you reach back pull the fulllength stool that must be lodged painfully in your asshole and use it to dismount from your high horse and simply get that what people tip is what they tip. I tip high. I dont want to be perceived a certain way by a person Ill never see again and am clearly a neurotic mess. This guy doesnt want to tip because either way hes a valuable customer and the system is laughably broken in the US. Which of us is right? Who gives a fuck its at the customers fucking discretion. ,facepalm,chapl5n,0,t5_2r5rp

966814,0,t1_chd62sn,When I was playing football almost  years ago the team was like any team made up of my friends acquaintances and of course those that I just did not care for. Some kids had outspoken religious beliefs while others just kept to themselves. And I signed up for football because of the benefit to my body. We lifted  days a week and then did cardio for . I was in amazing shape through that time and proud of it.I too believe each side has their own stance and there is nothing wrong with that. Where I see a problem is when such as the case of the image in the OP one side takes it to an extreme and attempts to blur the line of truth to their benefit. No matter where you are in the realm of belief that is just wrong.I am  years old. I have seen enough of all sides to be happy with my choice to be a complete nonbeliever. I am not spiritual religious godcurious etc. My choice is based mostly on the logic that all things can be explained. Yeah science is my religion you could say. There is no superstition no evil just fact. That makes much more sense to me.The other reason I refrain from religion is the history of it. There is so much violence for the sake of religious belief yet every religion claims to be the way. True peace is not gained from violence but from knowledge and religion seeks to oppress the attainment of knowledge through fear mongering and mysticism. Who benefits from this sort of ignorance? Those passing the plate that would be who.And that is the final reason I am completely against religion. Not only does it seek to control society through fear and ignorance but it also profits greatly from that fear and ignorance. Especially in this age of commercialism religion is one of if not THE biggest business to be in. I grew up and still live in the south and God is big money here. Churches are pretty much on every block and you rarely see a reverend driving a modest vehicle or living in a modest home. Just look at what the current pope has been cleaning up lately. So while I can understand you and many others have positive dealings with those that we label christians  as a whole this is simply another group attempting to force its view on to the entirety of society. It has been happening for centuries and will continue until human beings can move beyond the ignorance of the man in the sky. But do not misunderstand while my stance to not believe in religion is firm I have never attempted to force my view on anyone nor have I attacked another with a different view. I will only ever defend my beliefs.,facepalm,che6pvl,1,t5_2r5rp

Using a derogatory term is not a trigger. Graphic depictions of someones rape and beating... trigger.

Where does protection of human rights stop and where does tyranny and censorship start? But most definitions are subjective anyways. Racism too can be considered subjective.But I am pragmatic and I am glad we live in societies where child pornography is forbidden. In the same way that laws restrict personal freedom for the wellbeing of society I support speech restrictions on the same ground.I know its personal opinion versus personal opinion but if I have one argument semiflawed its an appeal to authority is that most countries in the world every single one of them? do not have absolute total free speech even in democracies.

2463061,0,t1_cmg4mni,It may have been about reproduction in SOME people but was not a prerequisite to survival or the flourishing of our species! See the difference? To argue otherwise is claiming that females of our species do not have and never have had any sexual desire at all and have always been only forced into sexual copulation for reproduction throughout history  not a very powerful argument and one that has no scientific backing at all! However the only instances of homo sapiens sapiens not being omnivorous  ie. eating both plants AND meat  is when certain members of our species have been forced to become herbivoric for short periods due to a lack of meat available to them at the time. That is the reality.We are still animals like all the other species on our planet. We may be smarter and more self aware but that does not make us any less animals. The smug satisfaction you refer to actually comes from the arrogant people who are unwilling to understand our history as a species and think they can dictate to others what is right or wrong to put in our mouths even though history and biology proves them wrong.I will point out again for the third time since you wont address it point me to any evidence historical or biological that humans are not omnivorous. We ARE designed to be that way  our digestive tracts prove it. We should eat both plants and meat. It is in our biological design and our history as a species proves that unequivocally.    ,facepalm,cmg4vi3,-1,t5_2r5rp

No one believes me that I ALWAYS used the metal to cook on Also I dont know about running the microwave empty but when I make two bags of popcorn in a row the second bag consistently has way fewer unpopped kernels.

And associates are not allowed to help unless I am like dying.Blood flying everywhere.  Dude screaming and flailing and fighting like mad.  I get him pinned mind you I am  and  lbs soaking wet but he is doing that sideways running in circles on the ground thing with me on top of him.By now there is blood everywhere and a huge crowd has formed.  I got the dude pretty well pinned down but I am using everything I got to keep it that way.  He is yelling and swinging etc.  Luckily a customer comes running in with a deputy that just happened to be in the parking lot.  He points to me as the good guy lol I got a laugh out of that but we get dude cuffed up.So as he is sitting there bleeding all over me and the deputy are checking me over for injury.  Luckily just some scratches on my arm and knuckles.  The blood is all over the walls counters register floor etc.  We close off that area and as we are doing so dude tries to run out the door in the cuffs.  There are many people in the doorway watching and kids and I cant let him get to it and hurt them.I leg sweep him and he hits the concrete ear first and GOOSH blood goes flying.  Thought I killed his ass.  Store manager is just standing there jaw wide open.Long story short guy came back with numerous felony warrants and was on the run.  Shoplifting to make it by without being found.And upon searching his backpack we find numerous prescription bottles.  The deputy asks him what they were.

To freeze water there youd put it in a freezer its beyond rare to be able to just put it outside and have it freeze. Thats the amazing part to them not the fact that water freezes below  degrees F.Reddit loves to hate the south and the south is dumb and shitty in a lot of ways but this stooping to a new low.Edit Im going to address the shitnado happening below. If there is anyone in Alabama who DOESNT know that when the temperature of water reaches below  degree F freezes then theyre a complete IDIOT. My point is that this post is just meant to be a way of saying that the temperature in Alabama is significantly colder than usual. Apparently its also in the context of Dont leave water out for your pet because itll freeze and the pet will get its tongue stuck to it or something so theres that to consider.But really Im sure these people know that colder temperature freeze water I know a lot of stupid people I know a girl who had to ask me how to boil water and another one who wouldnt eat vegetables unless they were coated in ranch dressing because the fact that there was water inside them creeped her out but even they were not stupid enough to somehow miss the who  degrees is the freezing point thing.,facepalm,cosfrt9,44,t5_2r5rp

I dont care about Gamergate because I have no vetted interest in gaming journalismpress at all so Im not getting involved in any of that. But when you get people who are writing articles about how gravity is sexist and are trying to get them published in scientific journals and taking up space where actual scientific research could be published and ultimately make science a laughingstock to some people that makes me fucking irate.There was a live forum at my university recently where someone tried to bring up the topic of too many white people in science and proposed that the amount of Caucasians allowed into STEM majors and STEM jobs at the university be limited to a certain ratio until enough nonCaucasians applied. They proposed a  ratio which if actually enforced would be batshit insane. Needless to say it was dismissed almost immediately but when I was sitting in there listening to a group of three people propose this all I could think was they cant be serious can they?

If you do not see the problem with making a statement like that then I will just leave it for others to consider.  It sort of makes my point for me.  Feminism has most definitely NOT good for everyone. And therein lies the problem.  Like any movement  liberalism Marxism conservatism Christianity etc.  the thinking people of the world have to decide how to parse out the good and the dangerous.For some reason I have not met many women who seem able to do this.  At least not in a way that makes sense to me.  There is some movement but only very recently.  I am still here and hoping for true balance and fairness  across all spheres not just for women.  And feminism has long since abandoned that cause and has shifted significantly in a new direction that seems sad and dangerous to me. That is if my read of just about every article comment and video I consume are any indication.I hope this gets better. Perhaps this is just a pendulum swing that needs to happen before it settles out to something that resembles humanism.My fingers are crossed. But they are also crossed in hoping for an end to starvation war and racism.,facepalm,cpcimky,-1,t5_2r5rp

3796593,0,t1_cqozar6,I was homeschooled and vaccinated. We did it because where I lived had a pretty bad education system and my mom wanted me to not be an idiot. We used an online charter school. It was great. Im the only person in my group of friendscoworkers that would redo highschool in a heartbeat. But a lot of people shouldnt be homeschooled. I cant even tell you how many times people have said You were homeschooled? You dont SEEM homeschooled. Im shy of course but that was even before I switched to a homeschooled program. But Im not socially retarded.  So many parents screw up their kids by not having them enroll in activities with other kids. They dont interact with anyone else for years dont leave their homes etc. Ill say that I certainly didnt go out a lot and I sure as hell didnt do any activities through our local public school. But I was in theater through community programs vocal lessonscompetitions I took a drawinganimation class and my sister who was in college at the time would take me to her college for drama club and I became an honorary member. Wed also do other things at the college and I got to sit through a class or two with her which was pretty cool. She also worked at Chuck E. Cheese at the time so she would take me there or I would go there after my theater practice was out and wait for her to finish so we could go home and Id be around other people in highschoolcollege working there and it was pretty great. Social interaction is really important and a lot of parentskids forget this when they start the homeschooling process. I was also lucky to have a school with actual teachers you could contact. We had optional webchatchatroom lessons and I was in a program through the school to teach leadershipteam building skills. Wed go on a trip with a bunch of other kids and we learned the normal teamplayer kind of stuff about proper diets and all that. It was tons of fun even if there was some unneeded drama but thats going to happen with any group of highschoolers.  would learn again. tldr  I knew what you meant with the dumb comment and agree. A lot of parents are too dumb for homeschooling. ,facepalm,cqp1ik7,5,t5_2r5rp

3896667,0,t1_cr0e4lp,Meh not the bitchiest reply Ive gotten today.And I understand what youre trying to say Im just telling you its wrong.  Yes these trashy rag magazines exist.  Why?  Because people pay for them.  Doesnt matter whos backing the stupid thing readership drives all in the news.  So yes corps do in fact own publishing firms...that print trash.Heres the thing though  in general print news and televised news to a certain extent dont operate well with a significant bias.  Or perhaps more accurately they arent as profitable as other print news which runs things without bias.  If you want to put a picture of Obama hanging from a noose like an old lynching picture go for it but now youre restricting your readership.  Polarizing issues are bad things to show a bias on.Also this is somewhat disingenuous.  I dont know many people who think rag mags are news.  Comparing this crap to an actual professional news source is missing the subtleties in the print news business.  A reporters goal generally is to win an award.  Be recognized on the national level.  Theyre not going to do that if they write obviously biased articles or hack jobs.  The job itself tends to cause a reporter to try to be as accurate as possible.All in all the press is indeed more free than youre making it out to be.  The goal of the print news is to make money and its hard to do that if you alienate half of your available readers.,facepalm,cr0gd10,1,t5_2r5rp

He is too ignorant to understand that atheists dont think his deity exists ergo we dont see any categorical difference between his deity and the unicorns fairies and leprechauns he mentions.Therefore his claim and explication of atheist hate are unsubstantiated puerile fantasies indicative of self delusion.This clearly demonstrates he has a perverse understanding of atheism at best. In his mind which cannot grasp the atheist concept that his beloved deity is a figment of his imagination we atheists are just stubbornly rejecting the truth.Therefore out of wholly unjustifiable sense of moral superiority on his part he rants and raves against that which he cannot understand.But of course fundies are quite good at that kind of thinking.,facepalm,csa50qi,2,t5_2r5rp

4501366,0,t1_csxlpni,Everyone says that the answer is we had a common ancestor. While that is true common ancestry is not the answer youre looking for. I have asked myself the same question and I found the real answer not all animals evolve at the same rate or in the same direction.Example If parts of a population of animals from a temperate climate were moved closer and closer to a desert each year leaving some behind every time then the individuals which have genes helping them survive in heat and drought as well as the cold of night deserts are cold during the night will live better than the others and will spread their genes to their children. Eventually you will have some individuals in the temperate areas and some in the desert and if you suddenly switch their homes they will all die but they all originated from the temperate climate. The process of applying pressure on a species to kill off individuals which dont adapt is called selective pressure.This actually happens all the time in nature because random mutations happen all the time and those who can live better in harsher conditions will likely stay there on their own because they wont have much competition for food. Then some of them will also get random mutations which will make them better suited for other areas. After billions of years and billions of generations you end up with something as beautiful as the diversity of life on Earth.So the thing with our common ancestor is that some individuals from a species evolved to be stronger or something similar and became what we see today as apes while other individuals from that same species evolved to be smarter random mutation caused their brain size to increase or something similar. Both groups survived in their own way and propagated their genes long enough that the differences between the two groups are now too big to allow individuals from one to produce offspring with individuals from another and this is when biology considers us two distinct species. The process of individuals from one species isolating themselves and becoming another species is called speciation.The Wikipedia page on speciation is really worth reading because it will explain why and how speciation happens tldr Not all individuals died and not all individuals turned into humans.,facepalm,csy1to0,1,t5_2r5rp

From working with low functioning kids I can definitely tell were not entirely separate things were very much cut from the same cloth. That made working with them very difficult for me I saw too much of myself in them. While others saw their behaviors as nonsensical I usually understood the reasoning and appeal behind it. I could tell their internal lives were as complex as mine but they were imprisoned by their inability to communicate. It was as though they had completely neglected to take any interest in language and utterly failed to realize its purpose or importance until far to late  much the way I had with nonverbal communication. I developed my own supernatural theorycoping mechanism about autism The skills that do not come naturally to autistics can be taught through painstaking explicit instruction and operant conditioning but theyre skills that are intuitive to most people as though they already remember from previous births.I think autistics havent been human for very many lifetimes. We were either animals whove just moved up or divine beings whove just moved down. In either case theyre not used to being human yet and are having a hell of a time adjusting to it.

Aside from that Jenner was proven by an analysis of her phone and phone records to not have been texting at the time of the crash.Shes not being charged because she did nothing wrong other than perhaps following too closely and not reacting fast enough.Shes not not being charged because shes famous and rich anyone else in the same situation would likely not be charged as well or would be being charged with a misdemeanor that would have effectively no repercussions for that person other than a court date and the charge being on their record.,facepalm,ct6rlkj,150,t5_2r5rp

4953781,0,t1_cuixyz2,Sure heres a NatGeo post on it gt The Confederate battle flag made its reappearance following the end of World War II. A group of southern states seceded from the Democratic party and ran their own ticket the Dixiecrats and the Confederate battle flag was very prominent with the Dixiecrat campaign in the  presidential election. Before  it had appeared occasionally at football games at southern universities and usually at soldiers reunions or commemorations of Civil War battles but other than that it really was not a prominent feature of the South.gtOnce the Dixiecrats got a hold of it as a matter of defiance against their Democratic colleagues in the north and the African Americans in their midst then the Confederate battle flag took on a new life or a second life. In the s as the Civil Rights Movement built up steam you began to see more and more public displays of the Confederate battle flag to the point where the state of Georgia in  redesigned their state flag to include the Confederate battle flag.Snopes took a look at the misinformation regarding Civil Rights era denial of white supremacy symbolism gt However the fact remains that the Confederate battle flag has long since become the preeminent symbol of the Confederacy and what it stood for and across the span of several decades it has been coopted by segregationist and white supremacist groups such as the Dixiecrats the KKK and the Aryan Nation. Certainly one can be a racist or a white supremacist without associating himself with Southern Pride or a Confederate battle flag but for better or worse no one group is any more authorized to use the Confederate battle flag as their symbol than another the Confederate government and its military forces ceased to exist  years ago and therefore have no say or control over the usage of the Southern Cross.As the author of The Confederate Battle Flag a recent book John Coski said in an AskHistorians AMA gtI would never deny that people have and do use the flag as a deliberate symbol of racism I devote much of my book to tracing and documenting that use but from an historical and ethical standpoint that is not the first assumption I would make about anyones motive without other evidence to suggest it.Here lets do some pictures and let the people of the Civil Rights era the prosegregationists speak for themselves          dixiecrat rally  the dixiecrats were formed when democrats adopted civil rights platform and southern conservative democrats strongly disagreed. they broke from the democrats started dixiecrat and eventually joined the republican party by the s hence how southern white conservative democrats became the Southern Strategy of southern white conservative republicans           I mean this is certainly not an AskHistorians quality post but I dont have access to academic literature at the moment so for a more indepth and historical answer perhaps you can ask an academic community . ,facepalm,cuiypz4,28,t5_2r5rp

4978127,0,t1_culy4t5,Firstly let me commend your ability to paste  links whilst on mobile. That was quite an impressive feat!Secondly there is no need for your patronising tone. It does little except paint you as an even larger arse than I previously concluded.  Now after careful examination of your wikipediapsy blog links I have determined that whilst many data points show a link between high IQ and atheism it is far too simplistic to brand religion itself as the limiting factor in intelligence development. It ignores the complex social economic and historical factors at play all of which can have great effects on intelligence. Indeed the most economically developed nation the US is an interesting outlier in terms of social development and yet maintaining high levels of religiosity. Could it be because there are more intense economic pressures on some regions of the country or is it because theres a church there?  One of the many scholarly articles linked in your wiki you so helpfully provided for me on this subject includes The Chronic Dependence of Popular Religiosity upon Dysfunctional Psychosociological Conditions in Evolutionary Psychology Paul  PDF Id advise you to read it as you may learn something Ill give you an excert you can read below. The author concludes  gtPopular nontheism also is a predominantly superficial psychological response to the socioeconomic environment in its case to a sufficiently secure one. The greater the displacement of religious sensibilities by more secular alternatives the greater is the corresponding suppression of popular creationist opinionthat is dependent upon high levels of belief in a creator. gtLimited to explaining longterm variations and trends in mass opinion concerning serious religious belief and practice versus secularism the socioeconomic security hypothesis is not a universal theory. It does not necessarily deal with casual supernaturalism the competition between sects the suppression or promotion of nontheistic opinions via government coercion or the retention of religious devotion in a significant minority of persons who benefit from secure prosperous personal circumstances. These problems like all aspects of the religionsecularism puzzle require further research. Nor is known due to the lack of examples to provide needed data whether western societies that have evolved high levels of nontheism in response to secure prosperity will fully return to traditional levels of theism if economic conditions undergo a long term decline. If prosperous nations continue to be so then religious sentiments should fare poorly while the latter is predicted to remain successful in less developed countries.Hope that loads ok on your phone.I didnt mean Atheism was cancer Im an atheist. YOU are the cancer self important douche bag who thinks he has achieved enlightenment because he has been to college or can watch David Hitchens talks on youtube. These people have points but there are also other points.

Losing someone very suddenly in a murder is going to inevitably garner a different reaction than another situation. Also expressing grief in full view of the public eye as opposed to in private life.

I can seriously not even begin to explain how this they became less extreme because we nuked them asspull is nonsense just read a goddamned history book that wasnt written with a political agenda. We didnt just drop the bombs and cross our fingers the war would end. Each bomb had a specific purpose and that purpose was to convince the Emperor and military hardliners in the Japanese government a geopolitical entity that the military forces they had available could not overpower the American war machine especially in a siegestyle blockade. Islamists do not have an Emperor nor a single organized military. They do not have a command structure you can dismantle or critical facilities to destroy. There is no geographical area that could be considered their territory except ISILstan. They live among innocent people in large population centers. There are no Islamic extremist areas for us to nuke. Sure we could annihilate the entire area that ISIL controls but keep in mind that theyre an invading army in those areas. Nuking them would pretty much prove ISIL right about America and give the terrorist recruiters the single best piece of propaganda they could possibly have imagined. You cant kill an ideology with a bomb unless you literally just murder every single Islamist and everyone else on earth with a barrage of thousands of nuclear weapons all over the world. Im pretty sure thats not what youre suggesting though.

5222808,0,t1_cvfj2jk,This got very pleasant very quickly! I agree absolutely that you are dealing with an awful lot of tribal situations here in the west and particularly in America we forget that in some of these areas we are talking about families who have lived in the same region for hundreds if not thousands of years and who have grievances that go back that far especially about access to resources. When things get tough and resources get scarce people tend to fragment along whichever lines are the most pronounced. This can be racial tribal socioeconomic class or religious and I think the primary drivers in the middle east is religious. It doesnt help when you have the leaders of countries like Iraq Saudi Arabia and Iran driving the wedge in to create better conditions for themselves. Add on top of that the fact that a lot of the outlying regions in these countries have had very limited access to the central government and mostly rely on tribal and religious administration for services and you get the mess we have today.And true about Christian vs capitalist. I suppose the best way to say it would be western but again thats another simplification. Nordic countries be like fuck yall to all three of those words.

It seems a little patronising to me to suggest that they only make that choice because they are blind to their own oppression.Many Muslim women see it as liberating. Their culture values modesty it protects them from the male gaze and can help with not needing to worry about body image etc.Personally if I was a woman I would not wear one but to phrase an argument the way you did seems quite disrespectful to me.,facepalm,cwcuhaj,9,t5_2r5rp

5525341,0,t1_cwhwgux,Wrong about what? Let me lay it out for you from my perspective in the UK.First off we have multiple grades for our degrees Firsts Higher Seconds Lower seconds and Thirds.Second we have these things called Graduate schemes. Large businesses specifically hire graduates train them for about a year which leads them straight into a decent position within their company. The degree doesnt usually matter as its just proof that the person is educated or have skills from being at uni.These grad schemes are very competitive. A lower second or a third is probably not enough to get one.So if I cheat and get a first or high second it will very much help me get me into one of these schemes. Once on the scheme I will be taught everything from scratch and off I go into a nice job.So... what are you paying for? Youre paying for a degree to get you into a job that will pay well.Now I earned my degree fair and square so dont start saying my morals are showing.

An assault rifle is an actual designation for a select fire rifle with intermediate cartridge. An AR is not an assault rifle unless you can modify amp register it as NFA.

They photoshopped the airplanes hitting the towers into news reports and everyone who was in the planes that died were paid off to pretend to be dead. Not even kidding. He didnt even know that there was more planes than the two that hit the twin towers. He literally just watched a documentary on YouTube about this conspiracy theory and thats as far as he went into educating himself on it. To be fair he was really open to discussing the matter and I made him look up videos of the plane crashes the towers falling eye witness and survivor interviews and read actual facts. He eventually changed his mind amazingly. Although he did try to find a new conspiracy that fit his new knowledge. But I was shocked and appalled that someone could believe that there was thousands of people willing to be paid off into being fake killed while their families grieved. Whether it was a government action or not I dont believe it was personally theres no getting around the fact that people died gruesome and horrible deaths that day and people lost loved ones. ,facepalm,cy22mwl,2,t5_2r5rp

It is a basic property right that entitles the possessor to  the right to continue peaceful possession against everyone except someone having a superior right  the right to recover a chattel that has been wrongfully taken and  the right to recover damages against wrongdoers. Possession requires a degree of actual control over the object coupled with the intent to possess and exclude others. The law recognizes two basic types of possession actual and constructive.Actual possessionexists when an individual knowingly has direct physical control over an object at a given time. For example an individual wearing a particular piece of valuable jewelry has actual possession of it.Constructive possessionis the power and intent of an individual to control a particular item even though it is not physically in that persons control. For example an individual who has the key to a bank safe deposit box which contains a valuable piece of jewelry that she owns is said to be in constructive possession of the jewelry.,facepalm,cz8s8un,0,t5_2r5rp

Its only because we communicate so much by text now that we are noticing.  The average factory worker in the s was not more literate than the average facebook user.Furthermore evolution of language is no more goal oriented than biological evolution or at least I dont see any reason to think it is.So yes we should work to speak as clearly as possible.  But shifts in language do not need to serve any purpose and we are not the first generation that dont read vry good.  The language will be fine.edit because people dont seem to get biological evolution Evolution does not work towards a goal anymore than gravity does.  Randomly occurring mutations that help a species make a home in the bone zone stick around mutations that cause them to die prematurely do not.  Evolution is the result of those beneficial mutations not the sentient purpose driven creator of those mutations.  And just because a species or a language is successful does not mean it is done evolving or that there wont be beneficial and harmful mutations still to come or that we will always know one from the other when we see it not to say we cant make pretty good guesses.,facepalm,czetgs7,1,t5_2r5rp

6403906,0,t1_czhj4sj,In cases where someone is considered a savant they often have delays in skills consistent with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Savant syndrome also occurs in individuals who have experienced traumatic brain injuries. The spectrum part of ASD means that this disorder occurs in people with a wide range of intelligence and other skills that are not covered in the diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic criteria for ASDs primarily involve deficits in social communication and social interaction skills as well as the presence of restricted or stereotyped patterns of behavior. There isnt any specific intelligible level associated with ASD. So when youre thinking of the typical media portrayal of someone considered a savant youre likely thinking of the more extreme cases where someone with very low functioning ASD and delayed cognitive skills has a set of skills in a specific area significantly more advanced than their overall functioning. However individuals considered savants like individuals diagnosed with ASDs do not have to be cognitively low functioning. There are savants with very very low IQs and others with very very high IQs. Traumatic brain injuries also arent associated with any one intelligence level. You can diagnose an individual as having an intellectual disability if their IQ and adaptive functioning skills are under a certain threshold. You cannot do the same with ASDs or savant syndrome savant syndrome isnt actually an official diagnosis anyway. It doesnt have anything to do with being politically correct its that ASD and savant syndrome are not defined in any way by the IQ of the individual. ,facepalm,czhk4r8,1,t5_2r5rp

The last time I voted I used what seemed like a very archaic machine with knobs and levers.  I trust the mechanical machines but you leave yourself open for human errormanipulation.

6756139,0,t3_487k3u,. There is not one cancer there are many types and some can be cured. So far there have been no indications that there might be a single course of action that is equally and drastically effective against all forms.  . Think of all the people it would take to come up with a cure. These people are doctors and scientists not executives. These people... these hundreds of scientists and doctors would have to have spent decades developing this cure with millions of dollars. Now youre proposing that all those people are just sitting on it and none of them have grown a conscience? Even assuming theyre paid off or their lives are threatened with a group that large its very improbable that none of those men and women of science would put their ethics above their own well being.  . Continuing to harp on the fact that this alleged cure would have been developed by a team of doctors and scientists were also proposing that none of those folks would be willing to face whatever consequenses from the medical industry big wigs in order to recieve a Nobel Prize and go down in history alongside the likes of Madame Curie.  . Most scientific research is done fairly openly but with patents and other legal protection from other companies using it. Scientific research is published openly so that it can be worked on one step at a time often by completely unrelated people. It can take decades or centuries for one discovery to lead to a second by a different person then to another before all the information can be put together and eventually you have a breakthrough. That process also would promote the chances of another scientist not in the secret group eventually getting enough scraps of information to put together the cure on hisher own.  . Finally why would the medical big wigs supposedly orchestrating all of this even bothered spending the money on cancer research to begin with? Why not just not discover the cure then theres nothing to hide. Spend the bulk of the cancer research on new yachts and do everything you can to stifle the progress of the research. That would both make money and prevent there from being a clear and tangible piece of information the cure that would completely crumble the scheme if it were stolen.  . To dispute point  lets address the fact that the companies researching cures for cancer are often not the same companies providing treatment for cancer. They are completely different facilities with different staff and often fall under different parent organizations. This alone debunks pretty much everything. Doctors study cancer independently and sometimes they do it with government grants while working at universities and sometimes they do it while working for nonprofit organizations. Theres no one Big Boss over all of medical unless were going fullon conspiracy theory borderline Reptilian People here in which case cancer shouldnt be the focal point of our discussion.Most of these points can be discounted if you propose that the cure was stumbled upon accidentally which would require point  being incorrect to begin with but then you have the issue of trying to find out that someone has found the cure prior to them making the public statement getting to them and everyone on their team prior to the public statement and somehow keeping them all silenced. See points  and  on why that would be difficult.,facepalm,d0i53kc,6,t5_2r5rp

6923974,0,t1_d10tv4s,Right.  I suspect plants arent consciously aware despite being able to react to stimuli because science currently has only been able to demonstrate evidence of consciousness self awareness theory of mind etc. stemming from neural activity which weve only seen in animals.Regardless though youve cited a common concern so its worth addressing.  Its important to note that veganism isnt about perfection  its not do no harm its about aim for as little harm as we can in practice.  As such theres nothing really wrong with the idea of trying to reduce the number of plants we raise and harvest.  Veganism actually ends up saving more plant lives as well though.TLDR here  A cow burns wastes as in nothing edible results from it on the order of  calories per day and each cow lives for  days.  That means every cow is wasting several million calories humans eat somewhere around  millionyear of waste per cow.  Feeding plants to cows then eating the cows is massively inefficient.  Other animals arent any more efficient either.As we know from the law of conservation of energy energy isnt created or destroyed. Calories are a measurement of energy so the calories in our food have to come from somewhere. All calories in the food chain and the macros we derive them from  ALL the fats proteins and carbs that we eat originally come from what are called in ecology producers or primary producers. Producers plants cyanobacteria and a few other unicellular organisms use photosynthesis to convert the suns energy carbon dioxide water and minerals from their surroundings to produce carbs fats protein and cellulose collectively called biomass. They also using some of the energy for the biological processes involved with living.At the next trophic level we have animals herbivores omnivores eating plants called primary consumers. Theyre incapable of adding energy into the system but instead consuming producers plants for their energy. There are two important things about about consumers First the amount of energy any consumer gets from eating something is generally around th of the available energy this gets called the ten percent law. Second that animal is actively using those calories living its life. For example humans spend in the ballpark of  caloriesday just living our lives. Thats by no means a particularly high number for the calorie usage of an animal. To maintain a lbs weight a cow has to consume around  caloriesday. Adult blue whales use somewhere around . millionday.Then at the next trophic level we have secondary consumers. They eat animals that eat plants. The same  law applies and they similarly spend massive amounts of calories living their lives. Consuming farm animals puts you in at this level of efficiency. Getting th of the energy that came from the sun requiring the consumption of x more plant calories as well as the lives of the animals involved.Being vegan puts us in directly at the lowest and most efficient trophic level were currently capable of doing which is much more efficient than filtering our calories and nutrition through another animals body.  Theres actually similar inefficiencies regarding protein and nutrition... but its similarly a long read though Im happy to discuss it.  Also all references to calories here are using the U.S. standard of Calories kcal  its typically denoted with a capital C but Ive dropped it here for readability.,facepalm,d115nko,2,t5_2r5rp

6928284,0,t1_d11c8di,gtBut human contains the word man which is really sexist.I know youre joking but there were actually some really interesting linguistic shifts in Old English which could be interpreted as shifts in the way society viewed men and women. I think a lot of people assume that the word meaning male human shifted overtime to also mean human being but the opposite is actually the case. Originally mann was a root word meaning only gender neutral human being and there was a term meaning male humanwapmannand female humanwifmann. The term for human slowly merged with the term for male human and the specific term for male human became obsolete. It would be kind of weird today if we dropped the word male in lieu of person right? Thats akin to the kind of shift were talking about.  While you cant make any specific claims just from knowing about this linguistic shift it does suggest that there was some societal change which led to the word for males to usurp the term for people. ,facepalm,d11n9xk,21,t5_2r5rp

6996469,0,t1_d168ekr,Right but it makes it seem like all people with white skin have the equivalent of South Parks Jew gold. Not too mention its wildly inaccurate to portray it as if these families are continuously passing on and expanding wealth. Most people with money earned it themselves and its not fair to them to act like they all inherited it. Not too mention that many people we call whites are descendants of immigrants who came to this country with very little and made their own wealth here despite also facing discrimination. This video tells people what they want to hear  wealth is just a product of race! It has nothing to do with how hard you work. You are unhappy and poor because of your race and to no fault of your own. But thats not reality. We should be focusing on societal problems that make it difficult for minorities to access education and attain wealth rather than making everything us vs them and sending this message that whites dont need to work hard and blacks shouldnt bother because the game is too rigged. Furthermore evidence shows that families frequently lose their wealth in just two or three generations.The prison part I actually thought was really well done and I think adding in more things that are modern societal problems for minority groups makes a lot more sense than trying to harp on white guilt for things that happened  years ago. Its clear to me that this project wasnt based on facts or research it appears to be the product of some people who came up with their own ideas of what they wanted to say didnt fact check and then put together what is ultimately an emotional statement more than a pragmatic or realistic one. ,facepalm,d19e5og,1,t5_2r5rp

But as far as the teachings of Jesus he said we have to help people not that we have to have the government help for us. Many in American protestant churches vote against government sponsored welfare programs but run soup kitchens and food banks take collections for all manner of different private charities provide basic necessities to young single mothers. A fucking whole shitload are involved in anti human trafficking causes many help women who have been involved in prostitution.

Heck they even renamed the Hoover Dam after he left office for a while because they wanted to direct their anger. For Obama and Hoover alike the field was plowed and sown with this problem long before he came into office. Couple that with serious tightening of belts from the financial sector and you have this weird time his entire administration has been in power. I am not going to say Obama has done an amazing job but his administration has done a better job than some folks. The problem is that these issues are HUGE in scale. There are more moving parts to an economy than this feature or that. Its more chaos theory than any cabinetpresidentcongress can handle really. Not gonna go too conspiracy theorist on you but the entire system is to blame. From Reagan up till Obama we have had a serious infection of oligarchical positionings that have dug some serious fortifications. Its like a cancer.

By not accepting what is or who is then you break that first and foremost rule. In my eyes that is not a true Christian. Also all the laws in the bible are in the Old Testament. Which Jesus himself in red ink said we arent bound by the old laws. And my honest opinion when we leave this world we dont have a gender anyways. People problems with what is considered out of the norms is mainly a cultural thing and not a religion thing. They will swear up and down it is religion but to not its the same thing with Islam.

7539908,0,t1_d2z3pg7,Im not sure what sources people are using here but most sites that you can readily Google are using studies that pulled breed mentions in news articles from the s to the s. You can probably see why this method is completely idiotic already.ASPCA and others have done independent studies showing media bias towards reporting pit bull bites and ignoring other breeds like ambulance chasing. News media isnt trained or certified to identify dogs by breeds. Neither are police. So you get a dozen breeds all lumped together for pits Staffordshire terriers American bulldogs mastiffs canaries presas etc. but you dont have that same issue with German shepards or rottweilers. So the numbers become inflated. Then you toss in ownership rates. We simply dont know what the most commonly owned breeds are.  If  of  dogs bite people and  of  dogs bite people which is the worse breed? Rudimentary exampleThe study most often referred to for ownership rates is A old and B shittyIt used classified ads to determine ownership rates. This is going to inflate some breeds and deflate others based on peoples preference. Itd be like going to the classifieds looking at what cars are for sale and determining the most popular carcompany. Its not that simple and once again it suffers from the aforementioned breed misidentificationconflation. I know I didnt think any of the stuff I mentioned but Im on mobile and Im not big on linking studies I consider to be crappy anyway. But if someone links something check its methodology.

I get severe social anxiety and used to frequently be subject to panic attacks. I know how it is to have something wrong and be unable to control it. But you know what? I dont use those things as excuses and Im constantly trying to get better. I keep trying to learn new ways to control my thoughts and anxiety and new ways to follow social cues in acceptable ways. And when I fuck up and people call me out on it I dont fall back on oh but Im autistic so you cant get mad at me. Because Im high functioning enough and have learned enough that I should know better. I just have to try harder and remind myself of things that arent appropriate. So in short no Im not fucking ableist. I just think you can try a little harder instead of hiding behind your disability and then claiming bigotry when you do something wrong. Edit spelling,facepalm,d3mxph7,21,t5_2r5rp

When I look at paintings or sculptures or any classical art medium I also perceive intrinsic beauty but through a filter the filter of deliberate human creation. Of course these two perspectives are different. Of course you come to different conclusions. But that does not mean one is not valid while the other is I think.

Because in theory the bank notes are supposed to be backed by something like vaulted gold but in reality theyre just government issued IOUs and the only consequence of printing more in order to spend future taxpayers dollars on whatever deemed necessary would be inflation of their agreed upon value thus compounding the debt. So technically we really do just print our own money but usually the only approved expenditures across the separation of government are things like defense spending instead of education or feeding the homeless. They choose to fund things like giant data collection centers to record every move you make on the Internet by borrowing against the future tax dollars you are going to pay but cant be bothered to make sure everyone is housed fed and educated.

Buying from a small producer like myself yes and no you still have to pay butcher fees usually around . Typically around my parts South Central MO they are sold for about .clb to the public from a range of small producers. Mainly this will cover feed and medical costs worming sickness etc. with about  profit for the farmer. Now  may seem like a decent profit but you have to realize it takes the farmer about  months from farrowing to slaughter. Add in the costs of me transporting feed from store to my shop my personal labor and costs of supplies to buildmaintain pens Im not making much money at all. Hell in the past  years Ive not turned a profit because of expansion and new breeding stock. All of this paired with fluctuations in the market  which plumeted years ago and fluctuating feed costs it is hard to maintain a good budget year to year.gtEdit is there a reason it is more in certain places than others? Or is it the norm to be the same no matter where the location is? And has that been the cost for a while now? The reason for cost differences by region is feed prices and overall market demand. Feed prices are cheaper the closer to crop land you get. If you live in the corn belt feed prices are lower than if you lived in the NE. This is from the price to transport grain from the fields to the feed manufacturer. If demand is high and there arent many producerproducers then your prices will be higher and vice versa. Now for me I buy lbs of feed and thats will last me for  days. I only maintain a breeding stock of  sows and a boar. My feed was about . a sack today when I went to buy it totaling out to about  around February I was paying about . a sack because of being out of harvest season and crop yields the previous year. ,facepalm,d7u09g0,2,t5_2r5rp

Here is an endorsement from AL.com an Alabama news site which lays out the concerns and considerations that Alabamans  a state deeply red  should think about in their choice. They endorse Hillary Clinton.Its very thoughtful and comes from a conservative point of view. Endorsing Hillary Clinton is not a thing they do lightly.

The practical gas mask reason is absolute BS. Im in the military.  of black guys have shaving waivers because our hair is too curly to shave with a straight razor on a daily basis without creating very painful ingrown hairs. So for medical reasons Im allowed to have a beard if I wanted to grow one. When you go overseas youll see the majority of special forces guys have beards to help blend while theyre in country. What Im saying is theres plenty of people in the military with beards and if you look at militaries in the middle east almost everyone has a beard. Plenty of Saudi pilots get their mask on just fine with beards. The whole gas mask fit is some dumb reason they tell you when youre in basic to get you to stop asking why beards arent allowed. And if their really was a chemical warefare attack we use fullbody suits to protect us from that not just a silly mask. The reality is that the military just prefers a cleaner look but were willing to wave that look when it comes to medical reasons and tactical ones. So at that point why not religious?

From an evolutionary standpoint sure I imagine that a big part of this was to help us avoid crushing our balls when we sit.  But the direct cause is simply the fact that our default sitting stance is to have our legs spread a bit.So its more than just the fact that we dont want to sit on our balls its actually a completely unconscious decision.  If were not paying attention thats just how well sit sometimes.Obviously everyone should be considerate about how much space theyre taking up and having your legs spread way apart is certainly something people need to watch out for.  However I take the subway a lot and there are a lot of inconvenient things that people do without realizing it.

Some take this a bit too far..gtgtThe fact many members of a particular group do X doesnt automatically mean X is a key part of being in that group.gtThe fact that there are LAWS in religiously dominated societies AGAINST X absolutely make it a key part of being in that group.So because there are laws against being gay in Saudi Arabia that automatically means you have to hate gay people in order to be a Muslim? Sorry but no it doesnt.Look mate the point I tried and apparently failed to make in the bit you quoted was that just because many Christians hate atheists doesnt mean you have to hate atheists in order to be a Christian. Just because many atheists hate Christians doesnt mean you have to hate Christians in order to be an atheist. Just because many gay people are camp doesnt mean you have to be camp in order to be gay.

9663004,0,t3_5dfmae,Payday loans can be  APR.  They are short term loans most of the time they expect you to pay off the loan within a week or two.  People who take these out often have to take out additional loans to cover the cost of the original loan.  It create a sort of loan loop that can be super hard to close.The typical bank loan is about  apr depending on the amount your credit rating and the length of the loan.  Id be willing to bet that getting a personal loan for k was a very good idea in getting those payday loans paid off.  It was stupid getting the payday loans in the first place but people get desperate and sometimes have no other choice to pay bills.  I have a family member who paid her credit card bills with her student loans...which is also pretty stupid.  Student loans do have lower interest rates so in theory it isnt a bad idea.  Not so much of a good idea if you had to have your parents cosign and you decide that you cant afford to pay your monthly payments.,facepalm,da461k1,235,t5_2r5rp

You dont get to choose for him.gtThen you punish them in whatever way the legal system...Its usually a progression of measures up to jail time.

10055465,0,t1_dbi8f6f,Yes he may not have been one of the original disciples but even after Yeshua was dead Judas was replaced after he hung himself. Paul saw the spirit of Jesus and was made to preach using his extensive knowledge of the laws. He may not be a disciple but that doesnt really have a whole lot of bearing I imagine. Yeshua of all people wouldnt rebuke people based on their title. His words all seem to line up with other scriptures so his words have just as much legitimacy out of all of them.Sin is as sin if one thing is a sin it is just as bad as another sin. I understand your position but while not explicitly stated in Corinthians he was rebuking the abominable acts of the Corinthians doing what they did and considering the rampant practice of homosexuality in Greece its not far fetched to believe he was referencing those acts. I dont have my books right now so I cant look at the scriptures in question so Im going off of memory. Its definitely still a sin Yeshua never overturned many of the moral laws of the old testament. He still thought that all of what was considered sin to be wrong and never sought to make any sin completely okay to do.,facepalm,dbi92dc,2,t5_2r5rp

10375827,0,t1_dck5b6e,Well Id argue that the first part of the statement birth control is bad for you definitely has some basis in reality and is not crazy. It definitely sticks out on a list next to sunblock gives you cancer. Though Id say bad for you is a gross oversimplification.Ive sworn off hormonal birth control because Im just one of those unlucky people who is extremely drug sensitive if theres a side effect on the box theres a good chance Im going to experience it and HBC comes with a host of unpleasant side effects. Some girls are lucky enough to not experience them I drew the short straw! That girl probably did too. unnecessary because its really really hard to get pregnant is where shit gets crazy. If you dont know the status of yours and your partners fertility which can contribute to taking several tries or not being able to conceive at all and the woman doesnt pay attention to her cycle which contributes as well but following your cycle is not  effective then its just a gamble. My biological parents gambled one night and lost spectacularly. My adoptive parents actively tried for years and never could. At the very least always use a condom! Its what Ive had to do and Ive always kept a box in my night stand because you wouldnt believe how manyhow often guys will be like OOOOOPS! Forgot the condom! Guess we just have to bareback!

Further searching found that he wants to keep the US from breaking with historical norms on percentage of the population being foreignborn. It seems he wants to limit immigration so we stay at  of the population being foreignborn.This is well above the levels that policy kept us at during the s to present. And is a level we arent even expected to hit until Trump is out of office. Im not sure that having more legal immigrants than we did in the last  years is severely cutting back.He also wants to move to a more meritbased immigration system so we prioritize skilled people more.When you look at the actual info I dont think it warrants saying he wants to severely cut back.,facepalm,dcx2sn2,1,t5_2r5rp

At the time I was on a probation period at my new job no insurance it costed me  for the pharmacy to issue tylenol s to deal with the initial pain. My uncle has cancer hes getting top of the line care his costs are transportation and missing work. Everyone deserves health care. I really hope the republicans have some sort of plan you americans deserve better. Ultimately I believe the system needs to be rebuilt to emulate other first world countries.

And now liberals are trying to use it against conservatives in situations where it makes no sense. TD was created because conservative views get downvoted in literally every single sub reddit. There was no place to have any meaningful discussion. Even rconservative and rrepublican were small crap shoots that got brigaded all of the time. TD isnt a safe space it is just a space.

In this way many laws of the old testament are still relevant today to many Christians and the process of picking and choosing which old testament laws are still followed stems from this as well. Theres plenty of old laws that people wouldnt even consider following today like not wearing gold bracelets or not eating shelfish because they were moreso seen as common laws of the period in which the bible was written and dont really apply in the modern era whereas something like Dont be gay is still seen as relevant. ,facepalm,dd26qcu,3,t5_2r5rp

Having a moral high ground doesnt make them go away and I dont see you in politics or campaigning to raise awareness of the issue or end the killing of animals for food.

11273516,0,t1_df88gh0,I am no expert but here are my thoughts. These may be disingenuous of the thoughts of pro life people but I like to think Im sympathetic to that side.Everything in your body is alive it is just kind of grey what human life is. A fertilized egg in early stages is not hugely different from most of the cells in your body at a functional level that is a gross oversimplification but for the sake of the point. Its also not independent and its not sentient. It doesnt feel pain it joy or  a connection to its mother. Some would say human life begins at birth when it is independent of the mother. some say at conception because to end the life of a fertilized egg is to actively prevent a future baby from existing... But IMO thats very similar to birth control which of course many people who are completely pro life under all circumstances are also against. Some say its when the heartbeat is detected  a really arbitrary distinction that is often used as something of a compromise. Some use some other arbitrary distinctions based on intuition and developmental science that indicates when it starts to feel pain and think and sense.Theres also the side of the discussion that brings in a legal definition of human life in regards to human or legal rights. Should an unborn fetus have them? Should a recently fertilized egg have them? Most agree that born infants should have them but is a newborn baby all that different from a  week old fetus?And of course if a fetus is apart of your body well no one can tell you what to do with your body unless you risk harming someone else.which I guess is why many drugs are illegal because of behavioral changes that put others at risk or contributions to global cartel economies. Thats how Roe v Wade gets through. Ultimately this trumps all of the controversy around the definition of life in America at least.Thus why the issue is so complicated. ,facepalm,df9u4ny,1,t5_2r5rp

Let me set them on fire for youI never said anything about Donna Brazile.I never accused the Russians of setting the number of debates.There now that thats out of the way...HRC was an undeniably controversial candidate.  I blame her loss totally on her.  She didnt sell anything other than Im not Trump.  She gave her supporters not a single issue to rally around.  Thats her fault.The Russians obviously affected some people by hacking the DNC.  You are obviously one example.  You wouldnt be going on about this stuff except that the Russians fed it to you me and everyone else.  Is it measurable?  No.  Did it effect the election?  Of course it did.  Dont be stupid.Do you think that the RNC wasnt colluding to deny Trump the nomination?  Of course they were.  Neither Bernie Sanders nor Donald Trump were members of the party that they were seeking the nomination of until they decided to run for President.  It would be beyond comprehension to think that either party wouldnt do everything it could to stop them.  In the case of Trump he faced a huge number of weak candidates from a fractured party and was able to defeat them one by one.  In the case of Sanders he faced a couple of candidates including a strong party insider that was the clear frontrunner of a relatively unified party for over a year and was too tough for him to take down.But I assure you that Trump got even less support from the RNC than Sanders got from the DNC until Trump won the primary.  The only reason it didnt come up more was because the Russians didnt attack the RNC.  Trump certainly brought it up on multiple occasions.  ,facepalm,dfvsl92,2,t5_2r5rp

They cant possibly see that paying taxes helps us as a society improve. My opinion is if you live in a country you should contribute to those who are not as fortunate as you local and federal funding and public services like the library and education. If you dont like it move somewhere that is not a modern country where you dont receive services like the police force and public schooling. ,facepalm,dfxa5q3,20,t5_2r5rp
11482204,0,t1_dfxebl0,A This isnt a suggestion to cut government spending elsewhere to fund extra food but a proposal to add an extra  tax on private tuition fees.B There are already free school meal programs in the UK. There are funds available for every public school to provide a good quality lunch to any student who is under financial duress hardship or from a low income family. If the school is not providing this it is purely mismanagement on their part not a lack of government support.C A lot of children who receive private tuition do so not because their parents are rich but because their parents sacrifice a lot to afford it. While this tax will also affect the rich it will hit any lower or middle class families who wanted to invest in their childrens future incredibly hard and all to subsidise the families who can already afford to pay for their childrens lunches. D Ironically by forcing hard working middle and lower class families out from private schools the effect of Corbyns policies will further deepen the intergenerational class divide between the families who have and have not.Conclusion Poorly thought out based more on an appeal to emotion than any actual facts. Source Part of my job is working with the accounts of publicly funded school meals. The amount already given per meal per child varies depending on management efficiency of the school and tends to vary from . at the lowest to . at the highest. What this will actually buy varies depending on the quality of the catering service the school employs of hires but that factor will stay the same with or without this proposal.The schools I work with also provide free breakfast for every student though generally only the poorer students take advantage of this as it requires coming in to school early and the breakfasts arent particularly enjoyable. Tea toast porridge fruit etc. ,facepalm,dfxi7kd,6,t5_2r5rp

11599417,0,t1_dgaq0g2,That passage they reference is as followsgthaving been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God who raised him from the dead. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness which stood against us and condemned us he has taken it away nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities he made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross.So I assume the sign is trying to be provocative enough to get you to look up the passage. Its not really tone deaf its just attention grabbing. If it was said by just anyone Im sure people would be offended but I assume Living Hope is a church and this is outside of a church so people passing might assume theyre trying to get at something worthwhile.,facepalm,dgaswhs,37,t5_2r5rp

11620009,0,t1_dgd17pv,Its pretty much a dirty word but eugenics explored the kinds of questions youre asking. I think that there are definitely outliers but its on both sides with each gender having certain perks that the other doesnt. Men have a higher center of gravity it makes it easier for them to do handstands. While women with lower center of gravity have better balance. You can try and compare the elite from both genders in competition but there are certain perkshandicaps that genetics hasnt outrun yet on both sides. What has been fascinating is trans athletes have entered the picture and people are not pleased. Just taking it at face value you now have a women with the genetic advantages of a man. Some people feel its unfair. I can see what theyre saying but what theyre advocating is having this woman compete with other men. But if thats the case why even have men and womens divisions if trans athletes cant compete in the division that matches their gender? At any rate I think these divisions exist because otherwise the sport would be dominated by one group. While that in and of itself doesnt change just because theres two groups we would have missed out on some talented athletes without the current set up so Im not mad at all. ,facepalm,dgd50av,1,t5_2r5rp

Making home ownership a realistic goal for those communities has exponential downstream benefits. Im not naive enough to think everyone could or should own their own home but its important that people who live in an area are invested in it emotionally and monetarily.

At one point she says women who use the argument of past trauma as why they dont date men and wouldnt sleep with a penis she says that they should take time to heal so they can be open to it. Ive seen these videos periodically and fundamentally they keep breaking down to her saying that we should accept her for who she is and if we think anything other than she thinks its wrong. Every damn video she makes breaks down to that by the end. She masks it by saying its okay to have preferences and that you shouldnt be forced to do anything you dont want to but in the end your views are shaped by homophobia and rape culture.
