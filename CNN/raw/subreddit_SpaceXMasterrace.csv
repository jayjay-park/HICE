4024335,0,t1_cqq48t0,I think youre overrating how important free marketing is for SpaceX and missing the larger point that making things public domain allows people to do whatever they want with them including modify them or use them for commercial purposes.Its an important gesture because up until this point space exploration has been done primarily by NASA who puts all of their imagery in the public domain since they are a public entity. This includes iconic photographs like pale blue dot the full earth ones from the s and the HD one hubble photos moon landings etc. There is a long history of these photos being widely distributed and contribute significantly to the general publics perception of space.This isnt like mcdonalds making their photos public domain. Anyone can walk up and take pictures of a hamburger or a McDonalds logo. The access to space is highly limited and if spacex wanted to withhold all photos and cut the public off completely it would be their legal right to do sobut they made everything public domain instead reserving no rights whatsoever.,SpaceXMasterrace,crf05u8,1,t5_32frp
