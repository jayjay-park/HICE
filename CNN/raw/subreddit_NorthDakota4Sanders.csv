7862791,0,t3_4mzh5e,Yep! I live in Williston ND but I am technically included in District  so I have to vote in Ray ND which is like  Miles away. It is inconvenient and I hope there will be an opportunity to bring that up but I doubt it. It is really quite stupid that District  only has one caucus location when it includes Grenora Epping a large section of Northern Williston etc. etc.If I get a chance I am going to point that out tonight. If I dont get a chance I may write a letter to the editor about it and call the Democratic offices in Bismarck and lodge a complaint.This isnt voter suppression though. I see it as poor planning. I hope people dont try to misconstrue it as the latter though. The DemNPL has been very even handed this election season as far as I can tell.,NorthDakota4Sanders,d3zukpt,2,t5_381gx
