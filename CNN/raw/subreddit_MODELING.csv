8071018,0,t1_d3nwaz7,Hey there sorry for the late reply. I dont get on Reddit as much as I should. I dont have a preference when it comes to clients. If youd like to hire me Im down!,MODELING,d4n9c00,1,t5_2r9pd
8689861,0,t3_4yxsnz,Pretty much ... but thats the point of a mother agency. If you think they can help you get to a larger agency and you are comfortable with their lifetime cut this is just part of the package. ,MODELING,d6ruzpi,3,t5_2r9pd
8963179,0,t3_52x88z,Sure!  Youve got a lot of charisma and it seems like youre at least contemplating spending more time in front of a camera and thats all it takes to do or enjoy modeling.  If you have commercial aspirations thats a different question I know people who pursue modeling for fun or even for artistic satisfaction but who have no commercial aspiration.  If you want advice on whether making money or enough money as a model is realistic youd need to provide some more info like   Where do you live or where are you willing to go?   How old are you?   Your stats  height weight bust waist hips dress size shoe size   A simpler shot like a modeling polaroid different from this photo by natural coloration a more neutral focal length wrapped or eliminated shadows simpler background simpler pose.These are the things an agent will want to know as well as the things a photographer or creative director will put in a casting call photographers and cds will still want to shoot some types of shots with you based on charisma etc. if you can get them to see your photos but here Im speaking only of commercial opportunities.Good luck!,MODELING,d7p8md8,1,t5_2r9pd
9015306,0,t3_53r12q,This shoot has the biggest before and after difference. Photos were taken in a basement with lots of lamps around with the ceiling lights off and a few taken with a cell phone flash as a spotlight. Even with a precarious set up we were able to create some beautifully artistic photos.,MODELING,d7vhzy2,1,t5_2r9pd

10669505,0,t1_ddggmnq,Which agencies should I go to for an open call? I cant go to like Ford or any other high fashion agency because I am  but I cant really find any Chicago glamour agencies. Also I go to school in Bloomington. Is there anything I can do while Im here?,MODELING,ddgh8oh,1,t5_2r9pd
10699725,0,t1_ddjlfvq,I dont know but most people who are    are in commercial catalogs. I am not sure how to apply. Sorry about that. ,MODELING,ddjli8n,1,t5_2r9pd

11062320,0,t1_delvp5z,This is Muse Management in Oregon. The photographer looked legit but my parents arent really comfortable with paying  for pictures anyways. They just said that having this photoshoot would increase my chances in getting bookings or going to castings. At the orientation they said  for professional photographer with  looks blah blah  prints  portfolio  composite cards and  a year for modelwire. Of course all of it isnt required but it should help. ,MODELING,delw9fv,1,t5_2r9pd
