8332393,0,t3_4tn3aw,I think its a little early to say. Im still way too hype over the fact that its even here my first playthrough was a surreal blur that I emerged from two hours later slightly dazed and very overwhelmed. This act definitely has the greatest density of information I think. And I find my feelings after I finished nice parallel to the general feeling act IV being pulled along by the river without any real pretense of control. I loved the exploration and small side events that were prevalent in the other acts how they rewarded exploration with little tidbits of interesting information.My favourite act is Act III if only because the distillery was amazingly well designed and the Act shed a lot of light on the thenenigmatic Weaver.EDIT I also seem to be getting a lot of slowdown?,kentuckyroutezero,d5j3rry,2,t5_2wdqh

10058209,0,t1_dbi8icw,I didnt know that there even was a Rift build of it though I played through it on PC. Id really like to try it now. Oddly enough I have a paper copy of the script because I googled Lem Doolittle out of curiosity and ended up on that Lulu page.,kentuckyroutezero,dbilxn2,1,t5_2wdqh
10944271,0,t3_5tydjd,I hope that this doesnt come off as vacant selfpromotion but I made an ambient album that was heavily heavily inspired by the KRZ soundtrack. Ben Babbitt was the reason that I got into making nonlyrical work. Even the project name is inspired by the Bureau of Reclaimed Spaces.,kentuckyroutezero,de8toif,2,t5_2wdqh
10965826,0,t1_de9p8n5,Cool! Didnt know this was sampled  its even a little bit more beautiful before the music was added by Babbitt but I love both versions.,kentuckyroutezero,deb1q5v,3,t5_2wdqh
