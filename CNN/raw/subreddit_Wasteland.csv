1301006,0,t3_28z96v,I started playing the beta and I really like the game. Ive played maybe  hours?Im not going to keep playing though. There are still a lot of bugs and things left undone and I want the total experience. So my suggestion is to play the first mission then the first branch of the second missionyoull understand what I mean when you get there then quit and wait for the full release. Youll get to create your  man party customize them level them up enough to get a real good idea of the game systems and have fun. I look at as basically an extended demo.,Wasteland,cifza9k,3,t5_2saza

1717113,0,t1_cjvfete,SPOILERThe subversion is that they arent zombies and once you turn on the air filtration you realize you were shooting sentient living human beings like they were cattle. I certainly felt shitty afterwards and the disturbing ease with which my team swept through Darwin didnt help one bit.SPOILER,Wasteland,cjvlsbd,2,t5_2saza

1938777,0,t1_ckmsgsc,No sir Im saying straight  across the board with one exception at  is very unanimous. I have no way of knowing if they agreed to rate it so or if they all independently think it is . Just since gamergate I feel increasingly meh about critic reviews and straight s also makes me meh. Overall Im just saying meh.To use better words Ive always favored user reviews over critic reviews implicitly and now I do it explicitly. ,Wasteland,ckmtebq,1,t5_2saza

If any of your original Rangers die you can ask one of the  waiting by the entrance of Ranger Citadel to join you. As for recruits you can find them all over the place including right there in the Citadel for the first one you can get. ,Wasteland,ckq8xor,3,t5_2saza
1980669,0,t3_2hbdcd,AG Center.The radio message from Highpool mentioned mortars and explosives and there I was patrolling the desert with my rusty M. I figured I could at least help at AG Center.I really didnt know how hardcore this game wanted to be. I remember playing Fallout and getting completely wrecked in some areas.

1998324,0,t1_cktuyjh,gtThere were a few crashes but the most annoying bugs were camera issues and combat issues. For example I would enter combat and none of my characters would be able to move through a door leaving my squad cut off.Thats not ba bug at all thatsj ust  your own teammates blocking the passage.,Wasteland,cktzxkb,3,t5_2saza
2014594,0,t3_2hsvou,I love ironman for games that can support it but wasteland  isnt such a game.Wasteland  is a storydriven game that unfortunately from my POV attempts to seem openworld when it very much isnt.This means that large sections of the game arent as enjoyable when played through the nd or rd time. Too much unnecessary dialog to click through too many puzzles that are really just challenges to how the UI poorly presents map information Whoever designed the ag center basement puzzles has nothing to be proud of. Too much needless watching of your characters go from point A to point B etc.Im enjoying my time but I dont think the game deserves to be played with the level of seriousness or commitment that an iron man no save scumming playthrough demands. To be frank it simply isnt designed for that since it wastes too much of the players time. ,Wasteland,ckvyei7,3,t5_2saza
2017448,0,t3_2hsvou,I save scum but I make up for it by having mostly skill based characters so the game is difficult all the way through.,Wasteland,ckwas0a,1,t5_2saza
2021194,0,t1_ckwluk4,Oh with those just kite them. Take a turn running away if you have to. They should never touch you. I only have  assault rifle user and shes my leader so has terrible combat speed. I missed the OP AR party. But in doing great with a one of each party except machine gun and ended up with  shotgun users. I really dig energy weapons.,Wasteland,ckwr0uu,2,t5_2saza

2029155,0,t1_ckxpzbj,Though I disagree with the other half of your STATs analysis I completely agree here.  The current system widely encourages exploiting the attribute tiers to minmax your starting team.A simple solution would be allowing accumulation of even just . AP . skill points .CI etc.  Just to smooth out the attribute progressions and encourage more diverse characters.,Wasteland,ckxqzu3,9,t5_2saza

2150066,0,t3_2jlthx,ItsComradeThe easiest way to handle him is with some explosives grenades or even a rocket. If you soften him up a bit it makes things a bit easier.If you arent enjoying the AG Center you could always restart and try the Highpool route it is a little more straight forward. You still would get a chance to fight the traitor at the AG Center post activities in Highpool.Now in terms of party construction many people advocate just making these combat beasts that can do little else. Nothing wrong with that just different playstyles. Here is how I built my partyGood Luck Ranger and dont give up!PeaceMal,Wasteland,cld4ewq,3,t5_2saza

4613243,0,t3_3e5y5y,We should test it fire the weapon  times and measure the real jam rate.It FEELS high like  high but thats likely bias. You only notice it jam when it jams the other  shoots you took that battle didnt jam.I havent played in a long time but I could not bring myself to use weapons without the magazines to lower the jam rates. Jams are just way too frequent.Youd think they were cleaning the weapons with jam or something.,Wasteland,ctc2vuz,3,t5_2saza
4616746,0,t1_ctc3icm,I just wish they up the ammo drop rate. I can appreciate that ammo is scarce but Im spending most of my time not using my best weapons because I dont have any ammo for them. Rifle expert? Sorry. Only have ammo for your pistol.,Wasteland,ctcipfo,2,t5_2saza

5498494,0,t3_3qdcdh,Yeah guys here are absolutely right. You may have an easy time with this guns for now but when you move to LA difficulty jumps a lot. I found it rather challenging cause I kept weapon skills around level  till the end of area one and my team was mostly focusing on social skills. In LA you have much more stuff to explore and its much harder for the first time you enter the area though you will get used to it.The first time I played Wasteland I also thought that Arizona is the whole game map and theres nothing much past that point. Though when I traveled to LA Ive found it more interesting to explore. ,Wasteland,cwehghr,3,t5_2saza
