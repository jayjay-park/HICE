2458851,0,t1_cmflcpi,Ive given some thought to flashing the entire log with a single piece of  aluminum laid flat on the top of the log seperating it from the decking.  The only setback with that is that ACQ lumber which we use for decking with corrode aluminum at a rate of  thou a year.  Another option would be tar paper in place of flashing but Im not sure how long it would hold up.As for borates I dont think they show much promise for this application after some review.  They leech quite rapidly.After another day of research Im leaning toward a single treatment of pentachlorophenol applied before the log is set in place.

Im primarily a musician and woodworking is fun too but its about time I moved out of my parents house so I need an efficient way of making money doing something that is at least somewhat enjoyable so I can continue doing the things I love. Carpentry was the obvious answer for me but I dont have enough passion or time to dedicate my entire life to it. I do try to do a good job with everything and I tend to be really perfectionist. I want to be a greatskilled carpenter but I want to keep my minimalist lifestyle which means not having to add unnecessary complications. Anyways thats why Im starting to have second thoughts about it. If I need to these things to do a good job than its not the right thing. Alternatively I could just get a minimum wage job that I hate but not have to worry about trucks and power tools. Ill eat up all of the knowledge and skills as possible but ideally Id like to keep the large space taking and complicated maintenance hungry belongings to a minimum. Its sounding like it is possible to be pretty minimal in carpentry if your employer takes care of those things. If I was to go solo or start my own carpentry company which I dont think I will ever want to do than of course I would need to get a truck and power tools myself. idk... thoughts?,Carpentry,cqzpnwu,0,t5_2r37m
