5118925,0,t1_cv2kr7j,As per the wiki stricttypes does not provide a gradual or optional type system in the way that Typed Racket or Clojures core.typed do. The reason for this flag is to help provide more optimistic opportunities to use the specialize flag. It wont stop compilation if types are not strictly adhered to. To answer OPs question see the toplevel reply from unullbuilt. Shen is the way to go here theres little way around it unless you want to use Racket. ,scheme,cv30ta4,2,t5_2qhcm
