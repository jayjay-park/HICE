When I was involved like  years ago Im pretty sure the amount of money coming in was minuscule compared to the amount of work people were putting into it and a lot of people werent getting any kind of payment.  It was entirely a labor of love.  Big reason  was used to help compensate programmers for their work.  Last I knew everyone who works on it also had a day job.I dont know if that has changed now or not as Im no longer involved.,habitrpg,d8fq4rj,2,t5_2w47u
