44164,0,t3_1uk7kt,As a professional artist and software developer I would NEVER treat my clients this way.Did you sign a contract with him?  Do you have a project proposal or briefing document?If you answered no and expect to ever continue working with artists or developers in the future then I consider this book an absolute MUST  Each chapter of this book contains about  pages and concisely and clearly describes each step of a standard professional relationship between a vendor artist developer etc and the client the person paying.  The forms are VERY optional but at minimum read the first half of the book it wont take long.  Whats so great about this book and the professional process outlined by it is that the process is designed to deliver reliable and fair results for both the vendor and client clarifies the relationship ensures the product described is also the product delivered protects from featurecreep and changehell ... and if you ever need to work with a designer and they dont do this you should probably move on.Anyway if you did have a contract with the artistdev it very likely specified the scope of work to be performed and the price for that work.  Very likely especially if the quote was a fixed price you were paying him to deliver a thing and not for his time.If he does not complete any part of the project then consistent with terms of most contracts and what a judge will say in the absence of one he is obligated to perform the services he promised to perform.  Failing that he must return the money he took in exchange for performing a service that he never completed.If he finds himself unable to complete the project at the price quoted then he can always attempt to renegotiate the contract ... but until such a time as there is a new contract ... he is still obligated to either complete those services or return any payment for any service that has not been completed.,Entrepreneur,cejgjmy,1,t5_2qldo

Do you know the cost of setting up a store yet? Before you apply for a loan it is a good idea to have contractor estimates a location dealer agreements etc. The more documentation you have the better. Guestimating setup costs wont suffice. Also what assets can you pledge as collateral? The bank will file UCC on all assets of your business but the bank will take more if you have any more worthwhile assets until the loan is fully collaterized. With no property involved you are looking at a  year term fully amortized. Once you get closer to figuring out how much money you will need to borrow use an amortization calculator to estimate your cash flow.SBA Underwriting is trickier for setups especially if the applicant doesnt have any history or experience in the industry. ,Entrepreneur,ceuyeey,1,t5_2qldo

Massive exposure.  Saying it costs nothing to start your business is sort of like a celebrity saying that theyre sold a million books and it cost them nothing to selfpublish.

185019,0,t1_cezhfh0,Thanks for your reply! And sorry for the lack of details. I totally agree with your opinion on when a person should and shouldnt file for patents. With that said we have a product thats unlike anything else on the market. My plan is to partner with a distributor and sell the product to them. Then they would sell and distribute it elsewhere. Its my understanding that I cant go around trying to sell this thing to people unless I file for a patent first. Otherwise I lose my right to file for one. EDIT Also the reason I brought up the distributor is because the products they sell and mine are related. Think of it like they sell shoes and use shoe laces. Then I come around with the idea for Velcro straps for shoes. I figure they could buy the Velcro straps from me and then sell it as an option for the people who buy their shoes to use like they can choose between laces and straps. ,Entrepreneur,cezieuj,1,t5_2qldo

If so I think the name is pretty misleading. However Im a little concerned about the price.  to take a class? Im not sure why you think your course would be worth that much money especially since there are plenty of booksaudiobooks that have the same structure you have and are in the pricerange of . Working as an exec for Singleplatform which was sold for  million as you say is pretty impressive. The lifelong learner thing looks like your typical blog. Just taking the Singleplatform part of it although you may have a lot of knowledge to give from running a successful company and selling it for multiple millions of dollars doesnt justify you charging outrageous prices to acquire a piece of the knowledge youve given. Charles Schwab and Warren Buffet have both written books with lectures strategies and exercises to help you become a better business person and theyve made billions of dollars. By the logic of your valuation system should I have to pay thousands of dollars to read their book and get their advice? First off why would I pay  for a course where I get no college credits when I could just sign up for a real entrepreneur course at my college or local community college? The efficiency is another concern that I have. The platform you have the lecture set up makes it so anyone who wants to take the course needs to take it the traditional way in front of their computer preferably while taking notes. However this is just not efficient to our day and age. I have listened to many audiobooks while driving because thats what the majority of my job consists of throughout the week. When I hear something interesting Ill bookmark it then go back and listen to it later while taking notes. If I didnt have this system I would be forced spend hours of my free time learning instead of getting the majority of it done driving which is something I have to do anyway. I think you would have better success making your lectures into a text and audiobook combo then selling it on amazon for about . I feel that you would get more people to listen to you your personal brand would increase and become more widespread and once more people know who you are then maybe you have a chance of charging  to take your course. How many of these courses have you actually sold if you dont mind me asking?,Entrepreneur,cf3lbjp,1,t5_2qldo

Especially for beginners or people new to the business world what you need to write down and what you dont is a huge learning curve you cant learn from turbotax. Its also a safety mechanism if you dont have time to spend on the phone dealing with the IRS if something did go wrong then use an accountant.   isnt worth the time to take the the  hours to do it. Just bring the accountant all invoices and transactions and let them plug and play.

First off buying from GNC and other bulk stores will likely leave you with margins that are much too small. You will have to be priced lower than GNC unless you live in an area with no competition for this product. Your best bet to source products would be to become a dealer for each product that you wish to sell. You can accomplish this by contacting either the manufacturer or their distributor. Some may have minimum order quantities so be sure to factor those costs into your startup costs. ,Entrepreneur,cfrlq9h,2,t5_2qldo

515339,0,t1_cfyiz1t,Most of my orders come from the US and Europe. Probably a  of total are American and  European.From Europe the largest countries are the Uk  of European and GermanyFrance. The remaining  of total orders are in China. Shipping here costs around  which is GBP or around . So these orders are great.Shipping a long tube mm! from Shanghai to other countries is expensive. Upwards of . The main thing Ive done to alleviate this cost is to offer a  poster bundle. Normally each poster goes for . I offer  for . The postage is the same for one or two posters so this works out much better for me. If someone orders a single poster to a more difficultexpensive country say Brazil I may just about break even.Therefore the main profit comes from i orders in China and ii bundles. Thankfully the Chinese orders are growing Ive been targeting Chinese learning programs here and about  of all orders at the  bundle. As for the EuropeanAmerican based printers Ive talked with a number of them. The base price for printing a poster of this size A or A is very very high in the West. Its also much harder to get in contact with a large number of suppliers in order to get comparative quotes. Alibaba.com in China allowed me to basically comparison shop  printers and get good rates. There would be a lot more legwork involved in doing this in the West.I have done some work on this front but all of the initial quotations were far too high to make it work. Additionally the MOQ minimum order quantities tended to be very high. I can ask a factory here in China to run off a small batch of a few hundred or  posters and they wont bat an eyelid  it will just cost me more per piece. They also know that if the work is good Ill come back for more. I talked with  similar shops in the West half UK half US and Id say  of them had MOQs that were just too high to make it work. As I say Im certain theres a way to do this its just from first impressions it wasnt going to work out much better. The savings from shipping are certainly worth pursuing though as this is my single largest cost by far.Once the volume starts to go up enough to justify putting in a large order one in US one in Europe etc. then Ill go back to these guys for a large run. At the current point it doesnt work. The other reason Im not yet using multiple print shopsshippers is simplicity. I run this not as a full time job. This is purposeful. I try to build systems so that I free up my time rather than take it up. This venture takes maybe  hours per week.Id love to hear more about the shops you work with in the UK. Ill check out Printful.

I am interested in getting into the online supplements business but I want to test the waters with a small sale even if I lose money just as a proof of concept.I have found a type of curcumin that is fairly expensive but it has a very strong scientific backing for it  I have reviewed the scientific data fairly in depth and it is quite compelling. Its attributes give it a unique selling point that I believe I can exploit. I am considering buying  bottles of the substance from a local distributor and then selling it on a webpage via Adwords. I have some experience with adwords due to my tour agency and I believe that with AB testing I can write a compelling adwords ad that will convert well. If it goes well I would buy the supplement in bulk directly from the manufacturer they sell the powder and require a minimum of  kg. My questions are  is this a viable idea or is it virtually impossible to make money using adwords to sell a supplement in such a competitive market  how much profit do I need to make per bottle in your opinion for this endeavor to be viable?  can you suggest a company that can encapsulate pack and label the curcumin for me keeping in mind that I want an elegant high quality label since the curcumin product will be at the upper price range    USD per bottle and  what licenses do you think I need to do this?I am very grateful for any assistance you could provide.,Entrepreneur,cg48urs,1,t5_2qldo

585665,0,t3_20tqaa,Hi I have my own tech company on the side. It offers the programming of prototypes like what you need to start your own tech company.From the sounds of it you can get a college kid to do a prototype by being duplicitous manipulative and shady. Legallybinding contracts full of ridiculous terms that you can hope he or she wont read will help your execution of this strategy toward  an eventual betrayal.Thats how you can get one.Alternately you can get people who know what theyre doing to do a job for you for equity. This will cost you equity or capital which you state you dont have. Giving equity may violate your restruction of just taking the idea and doing it but consider that this is okay he or she has the ability to take it and do it as that is what you need him or her to do.It is fair payment for technical implementation of an idea.Your next step may actually have little or nothing to do with your idea and more to do with being comfortable with not having  of the gains for your ideas execution.Another option is outsourcing without capital which is possible with companies like mine dont worry Im not trying to sell you anything my schedules currently full. If you come up to someone like me and offer equity for a prototype then well give you a consultation of what it will take to do that and get a contract sorted out for equity in your company or future company if you dont have one yet. So long as you dont expect them to maintain it afterward you should find that an individual or company is willing to enter into such an agreement.There are multiple ways for you to negotiate there so good luck!,Entrepreneur,cg6uejn,2,t5_2qldo

590592,0,t3_20wbwi,Yes. Short story once I wrote a blog post pointing out the specific ways our commodity product was actually better than the competitors in our market place because it truly was. The largest one proceeded to blast me on social media. My website got x the daily views it usually did and we picked up two new retailers because of it. So their negative publicity helped out. Edit reflecting on this a bit. It was never intended to be bad press. I was showing how we differed amp why we were better. My competitor turned it into negative press by reacting the way he did.  So this doesnt really answer your question as I did not seek bad publicity intentionally. ,Entrepreneur,cg7ek6z,5,t5_2qldo

I posted this to validate my idea and get good feedback such as yours but Im not anywhere close to launching if I do.As you said the one piece of the puzzle I havent figured out yet is funding.To answer your questionsgtTesla Motors offer free recharging for private consumers. If you are running a business with your car is that the case? I highly doubt it. What are the electricity costs to run them based on the mileage you have used for a standard taxi?Electricity costs are kyr assuming miyr driven and an energy cost of .kWh. Thats about  miles per day on average. All my calculations are for charging on my own dime since there isnt a supercharger near me.gtInitial spend and investment. You are going to need a VC or private investor. Say you run a small fleet of  cars that is a million quiddollar drop just for the vehicles. Add in another couple hundred k for initial expenditure and buffer. Lets keep it a m for the sake of maths. Lets say you get a VC to invest. He is going to want to see significant returns as m for a VC is quite small. What returns after paying drivers and running costs can each car expect to make in a year. Do not forget depreciation on the vehicles as the initial capital investments the cars needs to be factored in.Ive calculated a net revenue of about  per year per car after expenses assuming that demand scales with supply.gtLeasing. Will Tesla do a leasing deal? Unless you can guarantee a long term lease for a good number of cars and have the banked capital to make sure you see out your lease time this will not happen. The risk is with Tesla.Tesla doesnt do commercial leases. They have a buyback program but the amount of mileage on a commercial vehicle kills the direct resale value. I would be wagering a lot on the cars holding their value. I believe the most economical avenue is to use the cars until they can no longer be used which could be a long time since the drive train is highly simplified.I suppose once I get going I could propose a lease agreement with Tesla.,Entrepreneur,cgdmfm1,5,t5_2qldo

This guy is no different.Look at any huge company that exists today. Besides companies like Apple and Google who were really innovative in every aspect of their businesses similar companies already existed. Look at companies like Facebook and Spotify. Both had huge competition. Both found a way. Even if Spotify is hemorrhaging money they still have tens of millions of users but monetization is difficult in the music industry. Yes a business with a physical product may not be as flexible in tweaking things physically but who says that this guy wont be able to produce a surprisingly awesome longboard? Maybe hell come up with an awesome marketing campaign that goes viral throughout the industry.He has all of the opportunity in the world.

Learn from people are are crushing it at whatever you want to crush it at and bust your ass.A lot of young people are thinking with a  hour workweek mentality. They think they can start businesses extremely passively. Theres not a lot of people with work ethic. Hustling harder than others will get you further than you think. hour workweeks create  hour workweeks.  hour workweeks from the start rarely create businesses that can print you money passively.Read EVERYTHING from successful people.

Its the ideasparks that come from the stories that have pushed me.Its why I want to collect and share those stories. You dont have to subscribe.EDIT Ill give you an example. Before my wife amp I took over this spa that we just recently bought I read the story of Zappos and how they try to wow everyone.That book led to this storyOn the second Saturday we owned the place we got a shipment from one of our vendors. One of the products in the box wasnt matching what was in our computer. Turned out that the product skusize was changed by the manufacture and our computer system didnt have the updated. The manufacture made the size from .oz and  retail to oz and  retail. Instantly we realized that we may have accidentally screwed some customers over. So we pulled up the records of who bought that product. A sigh of relief came when it was only one customer. We called her up explained the situation and informed her that she has a  credit on anything anytime.Three days later she came in. She not only spent an extra  she also for the first time in  years ordered a service from us since we have both services and products. Her words was that she was simply in awe that we would have done such a thing. ,Entrepreneur,cguf9co,2,t5_2qldo

932435,0,t3_24smy1,I do a bit of teaching web development for people much like you and heres my advice. Learn the basics of what you need to get started. If youre doing web development the basics are really how to build a CRUD application Dont worry about fancy JavaScript or infrastructure details yet just focus on getting something functional that meets the customers requirements.. Just as important make sure its something people want. Talk to real people in real time that would want your product and write down the exact words they say. If they dont seem interested they wont buy it. If they say that they might like it they wont buy it. If they think it might be a good idea they wont buy it. If they try to give you money for some version of your idea right now itll probably sell.. Set up a web site now for the idea and use the words you got in step  for the sales copy. Get people to sign up for a mailing list so that you can gauge interest and ask them about features theyd like to see.What you should really focus on now is validation do real people want what youre looking to sell. Find out who would want your idea and find out where they hang out and ask them about it. Its a lot of work but its worth doing this for a couple weeks rather than build something over a couple months and have it flop.,Entrepreneur,cha9tkq,2,t5_2qldo

The easiest test to see if you need to look at somewhere to go will be to track your productivity and mood if you work from another location. There are several options depending on where you are located.When I really need to get my butt in gear and cant? I grab my laptop  find a place to eat  and have a working lunch. That can be a great way to kick start some things back into motion.I havent been able to commit to sharing an office with someone because  I cant stand it when someone takes the last cup of coffee and  because I know its just my mind distracting me and making me spend money.The other thing Ive realized in the past month or so? You HAVE to schedule time that youre just NOT going to work. If its an option  and if youre awake and working? Life gets a little dreary and lonely.Give yourself a schedule I started with one day a week where you work a . No more. No starting early. No checking emails after . ONE DAY that you pretend you work for someone else and DGAF. When the clock strikes ? No excuses. Youre OFF WORK!You can cheat this a little and find a day of the week that gives you a reason to go out and do something. Hit a MeetUp. Go to a park. Go to a movie. Something that makes it seem like its not just you going from bed to the desk.Hand in there  It gets better once you set some limits on everything. The bonus? That ONE day you limit your time?

Ad revenue was pretty much nothing...about enough ad revenue to cover web hosting costs.  My colleague and I surely couldve come up with some new ideas to drive revenues up most of which wouldve required spending out of pocket to get going...I think the potential was there but we decided to pursue other things and started an internet devmarketingetc. business following our experience and success with the sports blogging.  If youre banking solely on ads to generate revenue youre going to need to get upwards of a million hits a month to generate any decent coin.My view in regards to the market being oversaturated concern is pretty much the same across the board with whatever the niche may be  dont worry too much about what others are doing.  Firm believer that if you are unique and the best at what you do you can have success in whatever it may be.If your main goal is to make a living doing photography blogging understand that it will be awhile until any real revenue opportunities come and Id start thinking about ways to monetize other than selling ads. Id still encourage you to go for it as you clearly are passionate about it and it could be a coolrewarding thing to do regardless of how much money is generated.  At the very least youll gain some very valuable experience throughout the process.

Get your mum Im in the UK so dont like the incorrectly spelt mom word lol to make a ton of these things and give out small samples in those paper muffin cups and hand them out to  people of all ages and races. Shopping malls are perfect for this. Ask them what they rate it out of  for taste whether they would buy a bag or box of that stuff bring a representative sized sample bag or box to show them and what price they would think is a very fair price for that bag or box.

So you need to find a healthy middle ground that you personally are comfortable with.gt You can own a bunch of properties and have managers deal with the daytoday. Not sure if this is really entrepreneurialism thoughThats pretty much serial entrepreneurship by the book. Many entrepreneurs love building the business but dont really care for mundane day to day operations. Thus they either sell the business or hire managers and move on to build the next business. Its also a great risk management strategy. If one business fails you still have a few others that bring in the money.If you open and operate a pizza stand you are not really an entrepreneur  you are a small business owner.

1197561,0,t1_ci41oar,Theres a few different ways you can print your illustrations. Digital printing is similar to your typical inkjet printer but much higher quality. Everything is done on a computer so its very flexible though people have told me that the colors may not always come out exactly as its displayed on the screen. This is a new comer to printing I believe it only recently gotten popular around  years ago. This is the most convenient and I think cheapest to produce.Offset printing is like your printing press technology. There are negatives usually made out of metal that are rolled onto paper. Essentially a giant rolling stamp. This one has been around for quite a while though still considered a modern method of printing. The advantage of this method is that its the fastest method and allows the printer to mix their own colors so its true to what you want. Screen printing is when negatives are made on a silk screen. Instead of stamping on the illustration paint is pressed and then filtered through the screen onto the medium. Each color requires its own individual screen. This is the most time consuming method and the oldest as well. The advantages of all that trouble over the other  are you get true colors and the colors are much more vibrant because of the thicker layers of paint. Also with digital printing you can use crazy gradients and as many colors as you want and the amount of work required to print it doesnt change. Its a little harder with offset but I dont think they would have a problem either since most printers make negatives easily.With screen printing though each silk screen requires a lot more time and work to make. They are expensive and has a short lifetime since it degrades as you use it more which is why printers rarely would save the negative for you after theyve made order. So the more colors the more expensive screen printing gets. Gradients are notoriously hard to do too since each screen is made for  color. Some printers may have some tricks to make it possible but it may cost you more again since it requires a hefty amount of work on top. ,Entrepreneur,ci4ce7n,1,t5_2qldo

Assuming the consumer doesnt noticecare of course and is still willing to pay the same price.. If one brand does it everyone will have to do it else risk market share erosion.  You could make the argument that there may be firstmover advantage here esp. if the jar inventor is willing to offer a very very cheap license  maybe free even to the firstmover.As for increased consumption rates...Id be suspicious of that claim without independently verifying it.

1222066,0,t3_282igr,I got this.Sales are about making high fives happen your product is the high five.You cant make a high five happen if no one knows the high five is going to happen. You have to tell people look them in the eyes raise your hand smile etc. after they know theres a high five coming then BAM make the sale. after you make one high five next time you can upsell the experience do a high five and lock it up with a hug or double high five it next time. Build trust then build the experience. No one will high five you sometimes because they dont think they need a high five. You have to show them how a high five will improve their spirit and make them happier. Some people actually dont need a high five funeral goers thats cool make note of them there might be a different product for them later but its okay not to high five everybody in fact its better if the high fives mean something to you and to the person getting a high five.Some people new to high fiving need to be taught how to do it stare at the elbow and make the connection. But once theyve been taught how to high five theyll come back again and again and again. Some people will show up for the high five then do a too slow move on you dont waste your time on these people if they consistently trouble you  you have high fives to give out and not enough time to spend dealing with trouble makers. Spend your time on the people high fiving with gusto and passion. And lastly high fives go through cycles sometimes everybody and their mothers want to high five and sometimes not so much. Thats okay use the down time to study the high fivees and find out everything you can about them and youll learn when and where and how to high five them even when times are slow.Now go close sales people need what you got. ,Entrepreneur,ci73n4n,2,t5_2qldo

At first glance I dont know what your site is about Vegan then its telling me to shop now and something about water. Im confused. The header area is wasted on your site. It should tell me what you do and how I NEED your product it should make me want to learn more about it.  Scrolling down Im immediately asked to buy something but umm I still dont know why I am on your site and what you are selling or why I should even care. I dont want to think make it easy for me.

Tell me who you are not make me click more and search around your site for stuff. The text throughout the site is really small. It looks exhausting to read. pt is the minimum font size you should have for main text on your site. Those are just my initial first thoughts taking a few minutes going through your site. If you want to take this seriously I suggest investing in a good copywriter first whom can help you write your call to actions and get your messaging more clear then map out the goal of each page there should only be one per pagedo you want them to buy something? take a trial? give you their email address map out the path you want them to take on your site and work on how to lead them there then hire a designer that can put all that together for you.  ,Entrepreneur,cij95x3,3,t5_2qldo

Good luck with that. Fair use is what you can claim during your trial. It does not reduce or eliminate your likelihood of getting sued. If you win plan on being bankrupt  because even if you are awarded court costs youll need another lawsuit to collect on it. And let me make this clear You Wont Win and have no basis for a fair use claim. What you see that makes you think there is a loophole is equal measures of ignorance and the kind of wishful thinking the ignorant claim as protection.

If one of you understands money or is naturally more frugal or more detail oriented then that person gets to be CFO and control the purse strings.

1612006,0,t3_2cpn8r,There are many answers here some people with experience and others just making assumptions. As someone who deals with these factories everyday and visits them weekly there are a few things I should point out. Lets take a simple item that has multiple different components and materials.For this example we are going to use this bluetooth speaker. It is a very common speaker rebranded and sold all over Amazon eBay Sears Marketplace etc. You can see the Amazon listing here You can see a factory which is listed on Alibaba International selling the exact product here I know this is a real factory too because I had lunch with the GM and some workers last week to discuss an order for one of my clients.  This speaker has about  different componentsparts. I got this D rendering from another factory I worked with a few months ago they also produce these speakers.From the image I linked to above you can see the D rendering of almost every piece of the product. While some factories have the ability to produce every component plastic base iron rubberized casing PCBa sound driver mesh speaker cover battery and bluetooth component there is a very good chance nobody is molding cutting and stamping every component. So how are they made? For anyone who has purchased these speakers before and similar ones if you were to take them apart you could probably match up the like components and have a good chance that all the sound drivers came from the same factory all the housings came from the same factory etc. So the factories who are selling the final components are ordering all the pieces assembling them packaging them and selling them as complete products.What this means when you are purchasing multiple part products from factories the factories are sourcing the individual components first and then assembling them. Think of your car for another example the onboard computer is not made in the same factory that makes the metal on your seatbelt probably not even made in the same country. Yet the logo on the grill of your car is still technically the car manufacturer. So how are so many factories still producing the same exact item and how are they allowed to do that? Lets assume you are able to weed out the trading companies and scammers. Chinese factories often design their own products. If a product gets popular other factories jump in for a piece of the action. In a small amount of time factories all across China have reverse engineered a simple product recreated the molds and sourced the necessary components to produce an exact copy. But there is no logo there are no rights and there certainly is no patent so it is not a copy its just another product. ,Entrepreneur,cjiczb9,5,t5_2qldo

Some of these organizations have built a large following of customers and they are marketing machines that can move product.I assume they are similar to how the Android Marketplace iOS App Store and Amazon work. Developers agree to list their products and the store does much of the selling work. The store then pays the developer  or more of the revenue.In the case of Steam their customers are larger development companies but I suspect it works very similarly.

1737073,0,t1_cjxrw4u,The only thing that you would ever use those docs for is to get into litigation.  If you dont spend any time with them you dont waste any time in court.  My point is you dont have anything to protect!  Your idea alone and a discussion about it is not worth protecting.  If you send me a beta source version of your software I will most definitely sign a test and evaluate license.  You have a product at least in part.  You are giving me something I could take and manipulate and potentially sell.  You probably want protection.   Telling me about the aforementioned software prior to any of it being written is not a venue that needs legal protection.  Hence the NDA and noncompete are worthless.  On top of that do you have a legal team that is going to enforce your NDAs?  You shouldnt if you are in a startup phase if you do  you are not budgeting correctly.  If you dont have any enforcement  there is no need for the docs.  Also if you dont have the money to battle with the big boys in court why are you spending time preparing for that.  Plus you should care what other people say.  Take lessons from the people who are successful.  Guy Kawasaki being one of them.  You might want to read the bit he wrote about why investors wont sign your NDA.  Its not because they are stuck up dickheads.Oh and by the time your legal battle is won or lost  someone else will have had built a company out of your idea.  Assuming it was actually good in the first place.Again  beat competition by being better than them at what you do.To defend my point about legalities slowing innovation take a look at every big company and look at the exclusive licenses they hold and the patents that they maintain just so no one else can use the ideastechs.

They are more than just a reseller they are a platform where as EC is pretty much the same as any other VPS provider with a few more bells and whistles. You should look into the difference between IaaS infrastructure as a service and PaaS platform as a service as your list is a mix of both and the uses cases for which will vary wildly.With EC you need to install the OS on the boxes from scratch install the database configure load balancers etc. Heroku does everything for you so you just need to set a few configuration variables and push your code. It does get expensive quickly but if you compare how much it costs in developer time to setup and maintain boxes on another service Heroku will work out a lot cheaper to start with.

1806099,0,t1_ck6q770,Let me first say this before my thought out answer. If you just graduated college and the business is already under bad management and headed in a bad direction then there is a  chance you dont know how tocant save it. Regardless of how long you have been around there.Running a business is hard your emotional connection to the people and place are dangerous things when it comes to deciding whether or not it would be a good life changing massive investment for someone already K in debt and without real livable employment.With that said....Awesome... I attended Eastern Kentucky University. The reason I was asking is EKU has a huge insurance and risk management program and I can think of a dog boarding business close to its campus that to a tee fits what you described. Thought we may be alumni of the same school. Oh well.Theres basically two ways to fund a business from the get go. Investors You can probably write off the traditional kind but you can consider family friends and colleagues as a more realistic option. Just make sure you draw up exact terms and dont just borrow off of a family member with the idea that theyll get paid back someday. It never works.But for the amount I imagine it would take to buy a business like that youd havta have some special family and friends.. Banks A bank has the money to give you enough to fund the business. However they arent going to give it to you.....Unless you can prove you can pay it back. Which is the trouble.Even with a good business plan you still need to be able to prove that you as individual has some sort of capability to repay this loan. Usually a long standing decent paying job will do it unfortunately you are trying to buy that decent paying job to be the boss which is another strike against you. The only option I see in this is a loan from a bank... the key to going the bank route is getting a person with an incredible financial track record and long standing job to go sign with you put up the businesss physical assets for collateral and praying it is enough to buy the place. It may or may not be.So many elements of financing a business can be discussed in theory with buzzwords and in ways that dont apply to what you are doing. Especially online and on Reddit. But the truth is its going to be very hard for a young person to buy a business regardless of business plans or projections etc. Which also goes to say opening one in a different town will be just as difficult.But dont let that guide you away from what you are planning or doing. Where there is a will there is a way. However you might have to make that way and you might end up somewhere different than where you planned but you will make it. I started out fixing Iphones started a website that got coverage in tons of incredible press but never made a penny started a wholesale business in a small garage sold k first year went out of business because of loss of supplier wrote and sold a reality tv show I was actually on got cancelled after one season now I own a small closeout salvage grocery store? I mean... I intended on running a tech company I founded and make millions doesnt everyone.... technically I am a washed up reality tv star that sales closeout food in a small town in Kentucky.Point is if you cant buy this place do something that leads to the place you want to be. If you want to be the owner of a dog business any sort of dog business do things that lead you there. Walk dogs on the side Sell pet insurance Offer to take care of peoples dogs while they are on vacation at their own homes. You get the point I dont know all the dog related jobs but point is those roads lead to where you want to be. I can tell you this dont jeopardize any sort of financial success you might have because you care about the place. Life is tragic sometimes but a sinking family business is very difficult to save. Especially if you think you are solely going to save it based on passion and a bank loan.,Entrepreneur,ck6sxz4,1,t5_2qldo

Do they have certain parts they stock that are hard to get?  Do they have a certain style that they stick to?Find that thing they do best and then create the personas of the types of people that want that thing.  From there envision the daily lives of those personas and the various ways they could see you.  Develop plans to get into those circles they come across in unique ways.Im not a biker but I like watching bikebuilding and carbuilding shows on TV Overhaulin and the various chopper shows so forgive my example if its a little off.Say the shop specializes in importing old Harleys and restoring them in a punkhipster style.  Where do those people hang out in Germany?  Pubs?  Bike events?  Are there any bike rides with Pubs at the end?  Try to market on social media about real events that they participatesponsor in.  Nothing builds authenticity except genuine participation and getting out there with your customers.  Cant be in the shop every day.  The photos and writeups from the social events they go to are great content for FBTwitterPinterestInstagram that people will see.For folks looking for specific parts exhausts in your example find the online forums where people talk about modding and tuning and do a group buy offer.  Also look for swap meets to attend and sell at.Also because they do special exhausts people need to seehear the difference to get excited.  Nice high quality beforeafter videos of the exhaust sound makes it easy to understand what youd be getting.

Personally what I would do is put out the  boxes  for tips the other for the ice cream. Wait until the end of the night and do a quick inventory to get your profitloss. Think of this also as a marketing expense which for taxes it is. If it costs you  bucks that day are you going to get  bucks extra another day because more people are choosing your store over competition. I would take a risk and run this for  months or so and do the math tosee if you have an increase on sales for the entire month. Mcdonalds was giving away coffee free in my city for  weeks at a time.

It has to be a registered mark Most major companies have a DPML through a registry like us to block all TLDs owned by that registry. Some companies miss the sunrise phase and people grab the domain fair and square by ICANN rules. The company with the DPML doesnt get it automatically. They do get it automatically if the domain expires and the DPML is current. Companies instead opt to buy the domain from the registrant. We do domain after market on expired domains.

No. During the first  months I would only get like  per day if lucky. But I have a lot of experience in building traffic SEO. It takes time unless you go viral. You will need a lot of content. Thats how Google find your site. I wrote articles about any trending topics on social media sites like Reddit. I also check Google Trends. Then  months ago one of the articles hit first page of google. And I wrote more articles related to it. Site visitors find the  content useful and they started sharing it on Twitter and Facebook. That helps on search engine ranking. Then in the span of  months the traffic suddenly exploded from day to up to almost unique kday now actually.. I launched my MVP on May last year.

I am not an accountant or a lawyer and you  need to consult both of those and get an operating agreement drawn up to address all conceivable eventualities.Question  monetary draws from an LLC are unrelated to your ownership percentages. They can be whatever so long as you lay it out in the operating agreement. Note that taxes are paid based on your percentage of ownership not on actual draws. In my case I held about  but the operating agreement allowed for up to  of profits as my draw. I got a tax advantage and my partner took a tax hit because of this. Question  You pay a stiff penalty for every  iirc your estimated taxes are short of the actual bill. Standard practice is to make a large January payment to cover your butt.Question  You pay taxes on the profit of the business proportional to your percentage of ownership. Its treated as personal income whether or not you take the draw. In addition you pay Selfemployment and social security for yourself.

Keep in mind to my knowledge thats specifically for AdWords clicksconversions. But I have to imagine thats a fairly accurate range for most conversions.     You also have to factor in how targeted your market is. With yoga howto videos its safe to say a very high percentage of people viewing her videos are interested in yoga on some level within that itll range from people who dont really know what yoga is and want to see it in action all the way up to other yoga teachers. So that range of people will have different odds of clicking a PTC link or paying for premium content.     The key is analyzing data as you get it to optimize your site for viewers and money. If you notice a huge spike in people clicking a certain AdWords ad look at what you did that may have bumped that up and keep doing it. If you offer a course for  and only the first  people to email you get in and you get  emails of people who are interested run another course and charge . ,Entrepreneur,cl1th8d,1,t5_2qldo

2231558,0,t3_2kp8bh,Hey there! I am pretty new to this subreddit but i have time and if i can help out in any way i would love too! i work for a construction amp developer company in Singapore and a entrepreneur in the marketing amp leather products industryAre you a top middle or frontline manager?i am the COO of the company i generally focus on the general operations of the company structure.How many employees do you manage?i manage  office staffs and  site personalsBriefly how did you get to where you are today?For me it was mostly all about getting to know a mentor who groomed me and i actually manage to impress by bringing in a modern style of management in a very old industry which led me to be fast tracked to a senior management postWhat is your organization structure?ChairmanBoard of directors Consisting directors and  executive directorCEOCOO MeOperations Team Project Team Accounts Team HR Team Public Relations Team amp Admin TeamWhat works and what does not within that structure?Organization Structure from the way i look at it works fine when everybody has a clear role and has a very easily accessible communication channel.Organization structure tends to fail only when roles are not clearly defined which will result in fellow employees to miss out on completing certain task or result in works being done by different departments or employees at the same time which is often also the result of the lack of clear communication channelDescribe your involvement relative t the following functional areas of management planning organizing leading and controlling?in general my role revolves largely on Planning the direction the company is going towards restructuring whenever needed and lastly lead my fellow midlevel managers on my vision so that they can help to educate the rest. in academic context i can also be considered a internal change agent who review and makes drastic changes when needed.Who are your organizations largest competitors and how do you monitor them?Over at my country and industries competitors are almost around the same scale and often the best way to monitor them are thru tender results their projects progress via physical checks if possible and thru networking sessions whereby we often chat and talk about the industries as a whole and how fellow competitors are doing. Describe a recent management challenge that you have been faced with? A recent project disaster resulted in a particular project worth around . Million USD ended up making losses of  due to poor execution and planning by the project team.As well describe the decision making process that you followed to overcome this challenge or make that tough decision?Standard Operating Procedures SOP was relooked into budget control for project team was implemented to prevent a similar scenario from happening project managers was counselled and advised to practice more forward planning and i also get a IT solutions firm to bring in a software to help with monitoring and boast productivity.Many issues are faced everyday while there are days my downline would have to be given a talking to its often better to come up with a solution that is properly structured so that it would be easier to be implemented and executedWhat is the bestworst part of your job?Best would definitely be the challenge the jobs possess and also getting to meet so many people from all walks of life which have enlighten me greatly in being a better person and a better managerthe worst would be the stress and how boring it becomes sometimesWhat is your leadership style? How do you empower your employees?my leadership style is more on a handson approach i try my best to talk to all my employees from time to time check on the mental state and educate them when changes are needed. i prefer to convince my employees then giving strict orders to them so that they are able to better understand the need for certain instructions being passed down. How do you deal with conflict among those you manage?have them sit down and try to resolve the differences when relationships turn sours between coworkers i feel that it is always better for them to sit down in my office and talk it out while i act as a moderator and hopefully the issues can be solved.Are ethics and corporate social responsibility important to your organization? If so give an exampledefinitely in any organization if the company were to expand it is important not to let anything which would harm the company to appearand also being in the construction company it is essential to minimize air and noise pollution while using machines so that people who are around the worksites have a better environmentWhat skills are necessary in your opinion to be an effective manager?it depends on each individual tbh but in general i feel a effective manager must beForwardplanningcharismatictalk reasonsable to lead and motivateand able to stay neutral and look at things from an wide anglemost importantly i feel that managers must realize the biggest assets of the company are the people who works there and not the products and servicesWhat traits do you look for when hiring employees?somebody who enjoys being himself and not someone who forces himself to be somebody he is not and also people who shares a similar vision.What advice would you give an aspiring managerentrepreneur?well i wouldnt say that i am successful enough to give this advice but i always advocate that in business it is important to build relations be able to stay neutral and think long term and not short term if not consequences can be dire which could affect many to lose their jobs. which must never happen.hope i was able to be of much help! all the best for your project!,Entrepreneur,clnhfy2,1,t5_2qldo

2365065,0,t1_cm3muiq,Well basically the answer to the two questions is neither.The reason I started to focus on this area is twofold  I ride horses none of the show shirts fit and after looking for several months I decided someone needs to build them  I wanted a business that it made sense for me to write off my showing expenses. Many people in the horse show world do this as there is almost no money to be made in being really good at riding a horse. That is how I got started.It is interesting the more you get into the market the more you realize how large and segmented the market is. We have actually had to narrow the product range and I mean different types of shirts and styles for our product launch to not overextend basically at the advice of our manufacturers and advisors.That is why it is a niche product understanding the market is crucial most people say to me I had no idea the market was that big or nuanced or complicated etc etc. I just nod and smile and think  That is why I am doing this and not you.

2442676,0,t1_cmdiij7,In all honesty the initial work would be automated scans using a combination of common tools based on what I see as the common issues. The hook would be easy to understand reporting with the steps needed to resolve them prioritized. Once the low hanging fruit are patched then I can move into the more interesting work. I dont see myself as competing with MSPs as long as I stick to the S part of SMBs as long as its cost effective for me to operate a business for this target market. Although I speculate if it was the MSPs would already be there. This is why most of the work will be in relationships and reporting over the technical details initially. I also feel if you work with organizations when theyre young it can mutual benefits for longterm relationships.Thanks for the warning on free incident response I thought about this as well. The lowest tier for example offers one business day of incident response so it is limited. The higher tiers offer more but limited free incident response.,Entrepreneur,cmdmbar,1,t5_2qldo
2442961,0,t3_2nf4w5,Your question boils down to how do I set myself up to be a consultant. The answer is  the same way you learn computational physics  you learn by doing.So  do it. You become a consultant by contacting people developing relationships uncovering unmet needs then getting paid to deliver solutions. Join LinkedIn connect with everyone you know students profs past employers friends etc. Think about who your customers would be amp join their industry groups whether they are in manufacturing finance or other. Connect with the principals engineers or business development reps at contract design amp engineering companies that might use your services. Seek out industry  university cooperatives  like www.techhelp.org  that can link you into the design amp manufacturing community. Attend trade shows interview. If you know what kind of companies hire people with your background connect with people at those companies. Tip connect with LIONs LinkedIn Open Networkers so when you eventually broadcast your services or ask Qs it reaches the maximum audience.Next have conversations with these folks. Simple tactic ask Qs. Businesses do not buy computational techniques they buy solutions to problems. Your challenge is to uncover problemsissues you can fix. You understand what kind of computational problems you can solve ask intelligent  i.e. leading Qs  do they have those issuesproblems or know someone who does. Asking a Q gets the client talking  ppl love to talk about their business  and oddly it builds trust. Youll quickly learn the industry issues needs etc. and your Qs will improve rapidly. If you find problems you can solve  do it. Get paid. Rinse. Repeat. Scale.GL amp Happy Hunting!,Entrepreneur,cmdnkwu,2,t5_2qldo

2486209,0,t1_cmj2ixw,We hope to build an iOS app after we build out the website and get a small following. Currently there is social media integration and through each users profile they can verify their email phone number facebook and twitter to build their reputation by displaying the verified status on their profile.The accounts are vital in my opinion as there are many more features. The whole concept about this is that its not like craigslist where anyone can post. You have to go through payment verifications on Taskfriend which we hope will increase the quality of the content. That means that people who post a task are serious about paying to get something done. People who want to complete the job are serious about getting paid to do something. And their identities are verified since payment verification is required before you are allowed to post a task or servicedone through brain tree gateway. This leaves a paper trail which means its safer than craigslist because users cannot remain completely anonymous. Regarding starting small thats the plan right now.

2495544,0,t1_cmjv0lh,I had many photography teachers through college that created the most utterly terrible shit photographs while making literally hundreds of thousands of dollars each year from those same images.It baffled me at first and even made me a bit discouraged and almost resentful.  I like you felt that quality work should be the biggest factor to success.Then I grew up a bit and realized that quality alone means very little in the world.  The world by and large doesnt understand what real quality is. It certainly doesnt know what it wants when speaking to the mainstream it just goes with whatever big media says it wants.Very few can recognize the difference between Britney Spears and Pink Floyd Terry Gilliam and Ashton Kutcher or Terry Richardson and Patrick Demarchelier.It isnt quality that sells or connects with people the most. Its who you are as a person that resonates the most and drives success.Realizing such was very liberating.  It allowed me to recognize that I dont need to be perfect in my craft and it relieved so much unnecessary pressure. These photography teachers I had that were terrible but finding insane success were masters at this other skill. People enjoyed being around them enjoyed working with them enjoyed helping them achieve their goals and supported their passions. Some of them kissed ass but most of them were genuine and sincere about their passion for their craft and their desire to work with people.I wagered that if two photographers with equal skill of connecting with people were to go head to head that only then would the quality of their work win out and truly have a chance to shine.  The quality of work would otherwise always take a back seat to who was most likable.While working on my craft I started to work on my ability to connect with people.  I found success in doing so and it has always been the biggest factor in what I accomplish.  I havent kissed a single ass. Ive just been honest genuine and passionate. People connect to that and seem to want to have me around because of that. It keeps getting me work. It keeps getting my work and name promoted.The times when I have allowed myself to slip into emotional funks is when I saw business slow and start to fail.  I wasnt being a person people wanted to be around work with or support during those times.  It wasnt anyones fault for my failure but my own. I think you would benefit by exploring this theme in your own life.  Simply being proactive and getting out there doesnt amount to much at all if people arent connecting with who you are.Maybe youre not finding success because people can tell you are bitter depressed and shy. Maybe people have a hard time connecting with you and wanting to work with you. Maybe people have a hard time feeling good about helping to support your craft because youre not fun to be around.Maybe you are the biggest reason for your current failure.  If so youre the best chance you have at finding that success too.,Entrepreneur,cmkb0dm,1,t5_2qldo
2500043,0,t1_cmkdlqx,I think you have the concepts mixed. A logo as simple as it may look has a lot of research and iterations behind that do take time. you wouldnt have to ask yourself if it will work or not because it will if the designer did hisher job right. You use fiverr because you dont care about good design meaning something specially tailored to a specific need of yours taking into account the impact that design will have in your business and just want something to fill the space in your website. And it is ok fiverr designers are not a competition for me or the girl you interviewed. But they attend to your need because they are following the directions you give them. Thats why they are technicians not designers they are just moving pixels as being told.As for what I could put together in an hour it would be probably something that looks quite good technically but that has no purpose no meaning and it wouldnt really bring any benefit to your business. You wouldnt even know if it works like you say. And while the time it takes to make it does have an impact in the price is not the only thing that influences it. Good design helps increase revenue. Great design can even make you rich. But you are just thinking on how much cheaper it would be if done faster.But still you are not looking for a designer from what I read. If you dont care about the impact it may have and just something that looks good search for someone that has a good eye and knows how to use the software. It will be cheaper than a real designer and you wont have an unhappy employee that feels undervalued because you really dont care what heshe designs.,Entrepreneur,cmkw6b6,0,t5_2qldo

Im on my phone or else Id link to them but Im sure you can find them. Theres also the obvious option of asking any lawyers if they might offer their services at a reduced fee or no fee... after all theres a reason we associate pro bono with lawyers... because they do it so often especially when the issue is trivial as it seems to be in your case. That you refuse to acknowledge this and just expect lawyerly advice to rain over you in a sub not specifically geared toward giving legal advice makes me question your judgement. After all while many members of this sub sell products on the web no one would expect to get vital web design advice from its members. Talk to a web designer would be a perfectly valid response to such a question and complaining that no one in rentrepreneur will tell you whether you should build your app with Rails or Node would seem like the ravings of a lunatic.And so hopefully you see that its you who is polluting the sub with questions that do not belong here and that cannot be answered to any degree of satisfaction.Im normally not one to say listen to the crowd but here I think it applies.

I am entirely selftaught with my skill set.The Podcasting world is very hot but as with anything if you can find that niche and create engaging content you will get attention.  Your business model is likely to be advertising and possibly an adfree monthly subscription model.  Later on secondary income may be possible as well but because youre not offering education or other services its likely to be comarketing of products that fall in line with the interests of your listeners swag etc.If you want to see what is possible take a look at the Entrepreneur On Fire  podcast.  Lots of great content.  Not only that  He has chronicled his progress by doing monthly statements.  Open book.  Youll be shocked Im sure at what you see but I remember when he started only a few years ago.  Now I get to look up to him.Also and I cant stress this enough  build an email list.  You MUST get people on an email list because its absolutely the bestconverting pool of targeted consumers you can create still.  Then partner up with someone who was on your show and has a product and do a special offer where they give a special deal to your listeners.  Perhaps being on that special deals list could be a benefit of paying x.xxmo for your hardcore listener base.  The point is try things and see what happens.  Then try something else but always build a list even if it isnt segmented out for those who get extra awesome deals on things.  ,Entrepreneur,cmxtxlw,1,t5_2qldo

2603909,0,t3_2pnhel,Where are you exactly? Im a fellow upstate ny entrepreneur! Ive been developing a product from scratch over the course of the past year or so building various aspects of my business and learning everything I possibly can about shit I had no idea even existed  months ago Im bootstrapping everything and while its slowed my progress at times its also forced me to make wiser decisions in the process.

2604938,0,t1_cmyl6yq,gt Id just rather not given the nature of the whole business model. Finding a good product is the only real element of the whole equation thats difficult. I just prefer to not go out and say hey heres my item. I would be willing to personally bet that in the next  months more would come up for sale. I have no doubtI understand  but just think of it from where I am sitting.  If you are a top  amazon seller that means you must be moving a lot of product.  So each one of your customers is a potential competitor  for all you know they ordered a product just to see what it is and see if they can do it better.Furthermore even if its not an issue of your customers going into competition think of how much more a real entrepreneur does in terms of research and what sells on amazon vs what the avg person in this sub does  we are basically generalizing a bit but I think it fits not the competition you need to be worried about.Also if you are confident they will be up for sale in the next  months it seems like even more of a reason to be open.I could go on and on but again  my intention wasnt to argue with you about what you should or shouldnt do  just sharing why I discount these kinds of posts and saying how much better a more open discussion would be.I understand about mitigating competition  I would have looked at it differently competition will be there no matter what if you have a good product that is in demand...thats just how the world works.  Thats why execution is more important than the ideaproductwhatever.  In my eyes the potential benefit from people and suggestions totally outweighs any concern that the few hundred people who readcommented on this are the threat.,Entrepreneur,cmylpn3,0,t5_2qldo

2647677,0,t3_2q89xj,I dont know anything about pine tea or tea at all but Ive managed hundreds of ecommerce websites from the idea stage to them actually going online and my specialty is in sales and the psychology of sales. Here are my two cents I like the mark up I can see people paying for this and it looks like it has a huge profit margin.  I like the slogan Taste the Mountains a lot. Youve identified and highlighted really the only benefit of buying your product. Great job here. I think you should talk more about the air in your air dried nothing added section. Talk about how clean the air is in those mountains. Talk about where the wind comes from and what it picks up in the surrounding area. Talk about the clean cold wind and give it a really nice feeling really you are selling the location of the pine needles here and thats it. In your pollutionfree wild pines section I really dont like the line We use wild pines in our picking at least  km from the nearest highway or roadway. Just reading that makes me think of a highway and I think any of that verbiage should be avoided. Continue to stress how they come from a natural environment talk about how for miles around the only thing that is near them are more mountains and trees. Talk about the local large bodies of water that feeds the vegetation and how clean the rain is there etc. etc. etc. Just no terms like highways or roads or cities etc.. We can get that they are not near those things without having to read about them and just assume that by reading how natural the environment is. I really like the waste not want not section. Great job overcoming objections on packaging before they arise and making sure people are happy when they open the box while getting to spend little to nothing on packaging. The benefits section seems kind of low to me. You tell us how to not trust any health claims and that they are probably all false but you list them anyways. It seems like a cheap way to keep yourself in the clear while still listing the health benefits. Now hey there is nothing wrong with finding a way to keep yourself in the clear while naming the health benefits  but it cant be obvious that this is what you are doing. With the quality of everything else youve done Im sure you can come up with a better way to do this section. I think some pictures of the actual pine needs looking incredible would be nice here. This is a new idea to me and having never seen it before Im just picturing a bunch of pine needles in a cup. High quality images like your main background image amazing choice on that by the way go a long way. All in all I wouldnt be surprised one bit if this was a money maker for you. It all comes down to how you market it and how hard you work on it honestly. Ive seen incredible unique ideas make no money at all due to the people behind them and Ive seen simple ideas like selling umbrellas chap stick and magnets take off and do k a week in revenue because of having the right people do the right things with them.Sorry for any typos Just woke up to long ago and really dont feel like proof reading this.

2681826,0,t1_cn8mq93,I did everything lofi and organically.  Looking back its completely possible this was a huge mistake and perhaps I could be x the size we are now.  In the very early stages I used Craigslist to get  clients at a time which was a terrible way to get business I doubt that surprises you.  Then I started contributing on Reddit mainly critiquing the resumes of other people and mentioning my business when appropriate.  Later I began leading AMAs for resumes and career discussion which was an excellent driver for immediate and longterm business Reddit posts show up on google all the time!.  Forbes wrote an article  websites to jump start your career which mentioned Executive Drafts which was an excellent driver of traffic for a few days but primarily served as a badge of credibility in an otherwise grey area of competitors.  I will be able to turn that into future interviews and articles I think.Its over a year now and much of my traffic comes from Yelp where we have tons of star reviews despite only having a Yelp page for a few months Reddit and referrals.  Referral business in particular is picking up which is a great sign that were doing things the right way.Long term Ill open a physical office in Austin where we can transition to endtoend career consulting helping people from the resume and jobsearching stage through interviewing and on to salary negotiation and signing the final offer.  ,Entrepreneur,cn8mvfb,3,t5_2qldo

Unfortunately I ended up wasting  months on Shopify until I realized that it couldnt  handle all of my products and  each of my products had too many options to work properly on Shopify. I found myself paying for too many hacks and hiring people off of Freelance to resolve all the bugs due to the hacks. It was a nightmare. I considered WooCommerce but needed the same customization on my current platform anyway so decided to choose the better of the two. I ended up on SpreeCommerce which runs with Ruby on Rails.I sell customized sports uniforms with a multitude of printing options and several hundred types of jerseys and accessory products. The customer just has to be able to input their printing options and team information while knowing the price along the way. I figured itd be easy but the backend had to revamped and an API had to be built out.

Ben does a great job at highlighting how to combine empathy amp professionalism when having these talks and lays a great framework for how to deliver bad news. The second lesson was  the importance of having the right people at the right time. This wasnt a new concept but it was a great reminder as it addressed something I feel is often overlooked.

2871740,0,t1_cnuaf1y,HeyI have a couple of basic but helpful suggestions for you  Youtube preroll paid ads  Facebook video ads This is a good first option for getting eyes on your explainer video. You will essentially be paying for ad space and targeting the users you think would be interested in the product based on demographics geography age interests etc. On Youtube the videos will appear as preroll before your targeted group watches a Youtube vid. On Facebook it will appear in the targeted groups timeline. Some resources after a quick Google search   Full scope marketing blast email twitter blogs press release The k views on the Mother Russia was entirely based on this method. We didnt pay a cent for getting any eyes on the video however I would certainly consider doing that for a future product. You should literally build a massive list do research of anybody you could imagine that would want to share information about your product. Reach out to bloggers and post on relevant sites venturebeat techcrunch hackernews reddit etc etc. Email and call in favours from folks who have relationships with sites like that. Make a list of folks on twitter you would like to share your content. Reach out. Dont be shy but dont spam your account can get banned for hrs for this. And above all make sure your explainer video is good content. A video that is actually good content will do well when properly placed in the wild.Good luck!,Entrepreneur,cnuina5,1,t5_2qldo

Im quite ignorant in such matters and Id love for an expert opinion So I appologize if this question seems a bit general. But to be perfectly honest my question is Where do you start?. Where can you find out what patents already exist internationallyin specific countries? Is there like a website or something?. When looking for a patent how can you structure the wording in order to be  sure youre not infringing any ones intellectual property? It sounds more complicated than it may first seemFor example if Im searching for lip reading device and I dont find anything matching the exact words lip reading device how can I be sure they didnt patent it just under the titles lip reading service lip reading technology  mouth reading technology ect. . When you register a patent how can you make sure its registered in all countries.For example how would I avoid this scenario  I come up with idea A register the patent in England  Large international company starting with the letter G sees my idea in England patents it in Americaanywhere else develops it internationally. Large international company destroy me in court put me in a position where I have to morgage my house for legal fees.. How can I check what is legal and illegal to do with peoples personal assets or data?Example scenario I write an application that searches a website with its own content how can I make sure it isnt within this websites legal right to sue me for diverting theyre traffic to my site.. How advanced is patenting law on the web? I hear ecos of not very here and there but Im not very clued inAnd finally. Where can I keep up to date with these laws?Thanks for taking the time to read this question. Just as a note all of these examples are arbritrary,Entrepreneur,cnznt6t,1,t5_2qldo

3003379,0,t1_co8q1l1,I take back what I said about selection I was on mobile and for some reason the site does not translate well to that platform. On mobile I only see like  products for some reason? Now I see your selection is good.As for the logo I can draw you up something but I have to figure out how to work Imgur first in order to show you.When people click the All tab they want a quick rundown of all products that means they want a list. You should provide two options instead of one or the other. An All tab that is alphabetized and a Best Selling feature tab. I think alphabetized is best because the longer a customer takes to sort through layouts and find what they want the more frustrated they become because they are investing more time than necessary to sift through all that jumbled mess of best sellers for the one product the time investment even if its small may discourage the sale.I agree with your take on the oreos you can get them anywhere youd really have to think of a unique way to package them or make them a Users Also Bought This item that appears when people click on a bigger item. If that makes any sense?

If the idea is good the person who created it will own the direction. Then its just about getting a implementation of the idea in that direction.So if you tell a dev chances are they wont steal it they are busy with their own things and dont want to start a war with you. Your idea is probably not that special or communicated in a way that they truly understand the direction.If they do steal it however they dont have the original vision tiny abstract ideas are not worth defending and competition is good.

I kid you not being a web developer I have toyed around with wordpress and hundreds of other CMSes for years I started two forums back in the day which made me some good admoney but I never thought about affiliate links until I read your posts here and I am about to start right THIS second! I am extensively researching a niche or an approach and as to support you and if you allow me I will be posting my own progress report as a reply to your posts every month onwards! I wanted to ask you what do you think of easyazon.com it claims to be an affiliate linkmanagement for amazon do you think it actually makes the job of updating links easier? I wont buy it for the time being nor I endorse it but I am wondering if you think it would be of value in future if my own website grows.Second from an SEO perspective I know that writing reviewsdescriptions is almost always ideal but I really like thisiswhyimbroke.coms approach and I am wondering if a pininterestesque approach to posting products with a minimalist approach would be viable? Do you think that simply using a great design with a visuallyappealing listing of products is a good approach to affiliate links?Thank you once again for your great great great posts and efforts.,Entrepreneur,coixxy1,2,t5_2qldo

3175004,0,t1_coqtn7i,Happy to and I appreciate your thoughtsfeedback.I actually maintain the definitive testing for WordPress performance of hosting companies. Im shocked you didnt find my report on wordpress performance in your search. The problem is that takes tons of time to maintain and do. Ive done it twice will probably do it twice a year on average. It takes me two months just to collect the data before going through it.Keeping a speed index outside of that testing that comprehensively updates just doesnt seem reasonable or responsibly possible. Outside of very controlled testing like that link speed is so ambiguous. Places like ServerBear keep hardware benchmarks of VPS providers. Thats about the only real thing Id consider a legit ongoing benchmark. What really affects someone like you the most is most likely to be the code youre running. Better hardware helps but these days the biggest performance boosts are likely to be software caching. Whomever caches best performs the fastest. So anyone running custom caching under the hood like SiteGround is going to outclass their other cpanel brethren who dont which is nearly all of them.If youre super concerned about speed Id recommend getting a managed service or learning how to sysadmin. If you go the latter route Ive written a lot about that topic too for WordPress  and some for nginx. If you learn to manage it yourself you can really get amazing performance for cheaper than the basic shared hosting most people buy.Thanks again and if theres anything related I can help you out with let me know!,Entrepreneur,cor36mz,2,t5_2qldo

Also the PayPal Express button is on the very bottom on the product page definitely not the best place.Then i would mention your  day return policy somehow in the top header bar or more popular visible.As i said before extend your FAQ section with details about custom and duty fees that may or may not apply for international orders.

I launched a few small businesses and didnt have enough money to hire a web developerdesigner so I started teaching myself and making my own websites.  I quickly figured out that I liked coding more than I liked the individuals businesses themselves. Then I started building websites for other small business owners to make money.I joined the military for  years and now I am back in school and will be finishing my computer science degree next year.  I just got a new mac book pro a few months ago.  But I before that I was coding on a macbook that was  years old.  You dont need a high end super fancy macbook.  Find a used one or even try to find a mac mini if you are dead set on wanting to make IOS apps and what not.  Some stuff like emulators will run much slower but most of the time you wont notice a huge lag.But you really dont need a mac to get started.  If you have a windows computer that will work just fine to start learning.  Once you learn Object Oriented Programing techniques you can then pick up and learn other languages quickly.

3334147,0,t3_2ycqx7,Hi I also just raised this question to myself and my conclusion is it boils down to your target group as well as some tradeoffs You me and many other tech savvy people know about the new GTLD but many other dont and even if they do they still might not recognize a new GTLD because there are a lot of new ones  seeing .com at the end though immediately triggers the association of a URL you can type in your browser. So who are you addressing? The GTLD allows you more precise and shorter URLs e.g. say your company is named MacroHard then you will face trouble getting the .com name but with the GTLD you have a lot more options without buying a parked domain or without adding some nonsense to the domain name. Bonus point when have a new GTLD you might want to add www. in front of the address it triggers the same association as the .comappendix. New GTLD generally cost a little more if this is of interest. How are people coming to your website? Via internet its usually just a click so it doesnt really matter what the name is. Clicking a google.comlink is the same effort as clicking smerndwbsitewthmnyltts.software. But via wordofmouth it makes a difference saying companynamedotcom or companysoftware. Yeah I know youre providing software but what is the url? might be a common question when you just told the addressTherere probably some more points but essentially thats it from my side. Use these to decide for yourself most things are dependent on factors so no one can give you THE correct answer right away.,Entrepreneur,cp8bhgw,3,t5_2qldo

3357410,0,t3_2yijir,Hi SkinnyFattiesThanks for your post  extremely helpful amp insightful. Regarding WYND would you mind giving me more info on them? Im in the process of automating my product based ecommerce store. My business turns childrens drawings into custom stuffed toys however right now Im building the infrastructure to fulfill daily orders. A major concern is packaging the orders  currently doing it oldschool after they arrive from my supplier Takes WAY to longI have been looking around for shipping and packaging companies in the same city as my supplier. Supplier sends products over to packager and they package ship and transport orders. I never see my product is the end goalIs WYND a shipping logistics company? Will they be able to repackage print labels and ship our orders directly to my customers so I dont? Looks like a startup to me.... I cant even contact them. ,Entrepreneur,cpaywv4,2,t5_2qldo

3359046,0,t1_cpao2ql,Funny that you are getting downvoted without explanations because I too have come to a similar position after holding to the opposite position for the longest time.I did believe in open forums and I also believed in low levels of moderation. Then that changed to smart and on topic moderation. I learnt about and saw many different attempts to manage the SNR of a forum. Ive seen the gamut and Ive made a genuine concerted effort to make it work.My conclusion is that any forum system follows utility with heat death. Matter of fact this pattern has gone on long enough that I know there are people smarter than me who saw this a long time ago and have already moved to a gated community format.There is inherently an advantage to noise vs signal for many many reasons. And not all of it is noise reddit has shown that one persons noise is another persons subreddit  see picsgt Awww I dont see how any other long term system is possible unless you use some odd meta system where every x months a forum deletes itself and all users have to figure out where the new forum will be located or present some other form of merit driven entry criteria.,Entrepreneur,cpb5mv4,-1,t5_2qldo

Research showed me that it would be expensive and wouldnt make sense for people to invest in  pillow covers just because of the weekday on them so that led me into disposable pillow covers and then that made me decide on creating a box with  disposable covers which you turnaround daily for a total of  days disposable cotton pads for applying solutions oilabsorption wipes benzoyl peroxide . with a toner and a moisturizer all for a  days supply!

I was thinking it would either be a one time payment for the app itself a subscription service people spend a long time looking for a place so I think this could be viable or a freemium model. Obviously what I pay people to list houses would be a fraction of my income so I could sustain it. I wouldnt pay people a lot. Maybe a buck or two. And I would limit the number of people that could be adding at any one time to control costs. Obviously the details of this model arent worked out yet so it could end up not being viable though. My edge of competition would be that my customers could also make a little money from my service while finding properties that arent listed online elsewhere. Or arent listed in one central location. I think your idea could be a great addition to what Im talking about. I thought of something a little similar when I was brainstorming ideas of this but both seem like it would require my app being pretty popular before anyone paid to have their listings on there. ,Entrepreneur,cpfll1x,0,t5_2qldo

3412594,0,t3_2zahvy,First think of a relatively easy way to make steady income from your initial funds. There are many ways of doing this be it moderate arbitrage of goods starting an online store or something of that nature on the side to provide you with maximum runway. If you then spend a few hours a day looking at what could be better and things youd like to change youll soon realize there are infinite possibilities. Youll likely have a few notebooks filled with ideas. You then need to pick the idea with the highest likeliness of success. You start making that idea a reality and work on it as if your life depends on it. If you know little about the subject matter or how to engineer such a solution to a problem attend as many meetups in your area pertaining to the subject you wish to work on. Youll likely meet many others willing to help at those meetups if your idea is clear and concise. Overall put yourself in serendipitous situations. The main reason most successful startups are successful is because of serendipity. Networking is key. If you come up with your idea your chances of success skyrocket compared to starting a recommended idea since youll be far more passionate about it if it comes from your mind. The best way not to procrastinate is working on something you actually want to work on. ,Entrepreneur,cph9e3z,1,t5_2qldo

Best bet would be to draw an illustrated likeness of the player and use a nickname if possible. Of course plenty of people would ignore the legal issues and plow ahead. and you could get away with it for a while but you wouldnt be contributing towards a legitimate long term business. if you started to make any serious money you would be likely to get cease and desist orders or worse.gt sooner or later someone will come along and copy my quote and make their own tshirts. Is there anything that I can do to prevent this from happening? short answer no. whilst you can copyrighttrademark quotes and phrases  the cost is prohibitive and you are unlikely to be granted copyright if your quote referencesrelies on the IP of another individual or business.what you can do is prevent people from copying your design  and this copyright exists automatically without paying to register it. you can send your own cease and desist emails and these will be honoured by most marketplaces and web hosts. the best protection from people copying your idea is to be first mover and own the google real estate for your designs namephrase. gt Anyone has any idea in regards to how much advertising would cost me?

3508798,0,t3_30ghab,I feel that nothing about your business has been validated. The biggest problem right now seems to be that you dont know who your target market is. Or do you?Go out and talk to people. Offer to sell them your product for the same price you offer on the website. See what you learn. You will probably find that most of your assumptions are false. For example you state on your website a few times that the oil is organic. Under uses of oil you list that it is anticarcinogenic antibacterial antifungal and antiinflammatory. What have you done to find out if people really care about these things? What have you done to find out what sort of person is likely to buy your product? By even having a website youre assuming something about your customers. What if the people who are most likely to buy your product rarely go online but love to shop at locally owned grocery stores?Im obviously throwing things out off of the top of my head but essentially you are too. You need to go out and sell your product so that you can come facetoface with your actual customer. They will ask you questions you would have never thought would ever be a concern.The big thing is youll learn something about who your target customer really is.

If you primarily operate in Australia it makes sense to set up an Australian company as youre able to make tax deductions.Keep in mind that Australias company tax rate is  on profits and any money you take out of the business will be subject to personal income tax rates. If youre earning money outside of Australia such as in Hong Kong you cant bring taxfree money back into Australia. Sure you can enjoy the benefits of not paying excessive tax overseas but if you want to bring money back in to Australia youre required to declare it as income and will be required to pay income tax.If youre going to be travelling a lot or would consider moving overseas then maybe keeping your money offshore isnt such a bad thing. If youre considering setting up a company overseas I would first get some solid legal advice in addition to seeing an accountant. ,Entrepreneur,cpsb8px,3,t5_2qldo

Anyone that does any work receives equity equal to the work theyve performed.   The top eight contributors for each of the  sites receive a one tenth of one percent piece of in. So if you do a little work on site A you get a little piece of site A.  If you do a lot of work lead developer you get a large piece of site A and a tiny sliver of the other  sites.The reasoning is that most sites will under perform.  No one likes to work on site that fails so if it does but you were one of the main contributors you still can receive some compensation.Also people that contribute ideas for sites that are built they receive up to  of the site and they receive a full  of in.I hope this makes it a little clearer.I am very much of the opinion that the sites we create have to be FAR easier to understand than the in site.  We can flourish if a few hundred people get and participate in in.  For the sites were building we need to have many many more participate.

3579007,0,t1_cq07ocw,I have almost  BUT and heres the rub.  I was doing REALLY well like  years ago. I had about  subs and my videos all averaged  views a video.But then YouTube changed the algorithm and now what mattered was watch time and not views. With this recommended videos switched to being based on the users personal viewing habits and  videos from that creators channel. A common helpful tactic was being able to rank your videos next to a YouTuber bigger than you and then get spill off views. On top of that the algorithm affected the subscription box so even less of your subscribers receive your videos. These days the top strategies are hone in on ONE niche utilize SEO an associated blog google plus communities a facebook fan page a twitter and sites such as reddit to find those within your niche and market your videos. You basically have to stay on top of all your social media accounts and do the work the sub box used to do. Side note on Reddit With reddit and rightfully so people get angry when you self promote because a lot of YouTubers used this place to grow but then never gave back to the community. So I only post videos to very particular subs and even then its not everyday and it has to be one Im already a known member of and I make sure to make it a suggestion and not the reason I posted. You dont have to get a lot of views you want to get a lot of watch time which is how long people watch your videos.  A guy with  views a video could make more money than me if out of those   of those viewers watched the whole video. Where as with my watch time I average  which believe it or not is good. Thats why people do lets plays or Top  list because people will stay for most of those videos. Coming in fresh youll be working off the new algorithm so your return will be better than mine. I should basically not even count that first  years of work because those subscribers dont get my videos delivered anymore after the change. The hope in the community is the next algorithm change fixes the delivery system and those that rode out the wave will be rewarded but well see. But with all that said I encourage you to try Ive made some really strong friendships business opportunities and even got to be featured  publications like Forbes Kotaku and CNN for ranting about Pokemon Netflix and other stuff. Heck I actually won a National YouTube contest in  and Google gave me  dollars in free equipment. Am I living off it? No. But has it changed my life for the better?

You must pay yourself this as if you were paying an employee a regular wage. The reasonable salary must be a salary that fits your job description. After that depending on your equity in the SCorp you are allowed to receive the rest of your allocation of profits and losses as a distribution. Such distribution IS subject to selfemployment taxes and is NOT treated as a dividend...If you are a passive shareholderYou dont receive any wages and ALL your allocation of profits and losses pass through to you NOT subject to selfemployment taxes.Remember that distributions for passive shareholders are treated like a dividend not ordinary income because its a return on capital. Dividends are taxed at a very very low rate. This only applies to PASSIVE shareholders.EDIT I apologize for confusing the mechanics of the SCorp with a LLC!!An LLC active member IS liable for SE taxes on distributions no matter what.An active SCorp shareholders wages IS subject to taxes federal SS Medicare but ANY amounts that are a distribution ARE ONLY TAXED AS ORDINARY INCOME NOT SUBJECT TO SE TAXES.,Entrepreneur,cq2pzur,1,t5_2qldo
3600948,0,t1_cq2kvnx,gt Hell even to use your baking example you have bakeoffs with a cash prize. Theres got to be a point at which people would if we upped the ante to  for a  cake Im sure youd get every bakery in town giving it a go.Youre likely right but the  example is way out of scale for what  Designs actually pays. That and a logo can take a lot of schoolingknowledgetime and good branding can return a lot of financial rewards for a buyer. Not so much a cake.gt  From an economic standpoint as someone who knows where to look I can get much better value hiring one or two handpicked people who match the style I want rather than having to subsidize a bunch of very low level people. I totally agree.gtHow would you separate the commodification of design via designs vs the design market in general? Excluding brandinghigh end logo design projects almost all the designers I know charge on a roughly flatrate basis.Flat rate doesnt necessarily equal commoditization. I generally bill flatrate so the client is expecting the price and I can increase my hourly rate by working fastermore efficiently.Blatantly pitting designers against each other and generating thousands of hours of unused work contributes nothing. The buyer pays more the designers waste more and only  Designs really wins. Sure a designer can hone his or her skills and build a portfolio  it might be great shortterm for a brand new designer  but in all other respects they are ultimately wasted manhours that could be put toward something useful or at least revenuegenerating. It drags everything down to the lowest common denominator.More than that but less measurable is the investment of the designer. You want them to be as invested in the outcome as you are. My design process is fully collaborative. If I cant ask questions and research the business and the competition how can I make a truly effective design? A nice logo is one thing but a logo that conveys an entire business in bold clean minimalist lines that shouts a companys values loudly and that fits like a glove is not going to happen with a design contest. It has to be coaxed out with some giveandtake and getting your hands dirty.I want it to be exactly right every time. Thats why I dont do revision caps its not done until its perfect. I recently had a repeat client  his first logo was something like twelve examples and thirteen revisions and he loved the final design. His most recent logo was picked out of my first lineup no revisions necessary. Happy customer happy designer winwin all around.You can stave off commoditization by doing what you said above  find a skillful responsive invested designer who knows your style and hold on to them tightly. Pay a good rate give them a bonus if youre particularly happy and you have a little extra cash. Youll be at the top of the list for ultimately much less money.Thats how my customers get priority.,Entrepreneur,cq2qfga,2,t5_2qldo

What youre proposing is certainly possible but there are a number of challenges Getting access to detailed enough data. Sure there are public tornado risk maps but they tend to be on a level of a city not each individual house. Some cities might publish exact locations of crimes others only districtwide numbers. Converting all data to comparable coordinates and formats. Some cities have great Open Data feeds ready for analysis... others might publish just a PDF report or a map as an image that needs to be parsed. Theres a lot of data. There are  million houses in the US and a lot more spaces where a house could be built. Keeping various risk scores for each would be a reasonably sized dataset  not big data sized but certainly enough to make performance something that needs to be considered.So its certainly doable but a substantial challenge. If you find a city where detailed data is already available in a computerreadable format then starting from that single city would be much easier than trying to solve it for all cities.,Entrepreneur,cqcxjmx,2,t5_2qldo

3724070,0,t3_331ohe,Hey guys. Im OP from the logos thread. Since this thread is adressed directly by uBigSlowTarget I want to add a thing or two. First Im sorry for not putting a clear cap on the amount of submissions I can do  I wasnt expecting  entries. At all. I did a similar thing over a year ago and got maybe  requests. Second its not that I cant make an unlimited amount of logos. I can easily make  logos for the people who requested and Im sure a few would be happy with what they get. But honestly the results would be bad thoughtless and uninspired. I dont think that benefits anyone. As such Id rather spend more time on a single piece and not be able to do all of them than do all of them crappy.Third I just updated the post reflecting how I want to tackle the situation. Since it has been removed heres a direct link As you can see I try to handle as many as possible as quickly as possible but after that I will be coming back and checking off one by one.Fourth I mentioned something about hiring me only because there were various people asking me about it. I dont think thats spam but I get how it can be seen as such and removed that part.And lastly regarding freebies on rEntrepreneur  I obviously dont see them as a problem as long as the service offered is quality. I also dont see so many posts that it seems to be drowning out the other content. Judging from the response I got on my post the community at large seems to be okay with it since the thread had  upvotes  upvoted by the time of being removed. If something is blatantly spam Im all for removing it but I think it depends on the context.Edit One more thing regarding the spam part. I do this for fun. I run a branding and interactive agency by day and night  and it has simply been a bit codeheavy at the moment. I assure you that offering  for a small brand package is a an absolute steal for what I usually charge and I could never live off projects like that.And a thing about logos and Entrepreneurs I agree that many of you with the funds will go and pay for it. And as a designer I am glad you do. But many of the folks posting are just starting out. Most of their businesses will probably fail thats just how it is right? And a good logo costs maybe more than what they can afford right now. Getting one is in many cases a huge motivator. An idea is suddenly more than just that. You can proudly show it off to other people go print some business cards and network. For many people its good motivation and if I can help with that I would like to do so. And by taking more than  minutes to design one I can most likely get them something better than they could get for free or cheap otherwise and as such maybe at least in some small part  help their business to do just a little bit better.Edit  Realized the post shows up as removed for everyone but me. Well heres what I wrote at the topThats it folks Currently cant accept more requests. This post blew up a lot more than I expected. I try to put effort into the logos I create for this community and I hope it shows so sadly I wont be able to help everyone right now. Im going to work on some more requests today tomorrow and then during the next week and Ill be coming back to this post after that to finish logos wherever I can. Since it may take a while Ill be asking posters in advance if they are still looking for the logo otherwise maybe Im creating a logo for someone who already got one elsewhere. Come back every once in a while to check on the progress! Thank you all for being part of this and being patient! And sorry for not putting a cap on this from the beginning.,Entrepreneur,cqgrpww,6,t5_2qldo

Or they could do social media campaigns.You can team up with Big BrothersBig Sisters or other nonprofits in Chicago. You could also partner with a university or vocational school that has entrepreneurial classes. College students like to volunteer and are great mentors for young women.The main issue of giving clothes to lowincome women is it doesnt have longterm value. Job skills like fashion design and marketing mentoring and being part of a business seems like it will capture their imaginations.   I used to live in Chicago and worked on a young womens leadership project. I spent three years working with teen women. The experience really changed me.

I have one business in that space and we achieve a return of x  times! with faebook ads. And we could still optimize it better. We are doing marketing inhouse which is an option if you are willing to learn the details of it and have skills such as graphic design copy writing and enjoy analytics. If you hire a company just try them for a month and see what return they can provide. The proof is in the pudding. Depending on how in depth you want to test things the minimum time requirement isnt that high.

3825638,0,t1_cqripjh,interesting.. thats pretty good actually. i was expecting it to be a higher rate. overall you basically want to look at all your pages and see which have the highest bounce rates. you want to make changes to those pages and see if you can get those bounce rates down. for example.. if you see a lot of people going from your homepage and im guessing they are clicking on that big red button in the middle the most? however..  can you tell me the bounce rate at  ?im gonna guess maybe they stay on this page for a bit but eventually they leave? first i want to say myself and NO ONE else is an expert in this because testing is the king. however i see on the next page it looks just like a basic ecommerce conversion page but no info really above the fold. it just says add to cart  and choose stuff. who knows.. maybe this is the best converting page? actually no something can always increase conversions P but what is the bounce rate on productstieslimmingservice ?maybe you could try redesinging the page to bring more info about hte product up to the top. the reason i say is because i used to work at a company where we sold ecommerce products. we had a page where people could just add to cart right away when they landed but i found it didnt convert well. so i built a page that showed more info at the top kinda sales ish.. think like.. These products are the best at the lowest cost! whatever whatever.. then a bunch of bullet points going down.. then a bunch of spots where they can click and go get more info like a bridge page almost to the next page where they could actually purchase. or you could have more info here at the top and then see how it goes.i dont think analytics offers it anymore but you could write a pretty simple php script to where whenever someone clicks on the homepage red button split it between this page and redesign a new page and see how it goes with the new page. see which one gets a lower bounce rate or higher conversion rate.how much traffic is hitting these pages though usually? besides reddit obviously.. i think a lot of people would investigate into the page it probably skewed the stats a little. ,Entrepreneur,cqscsvd,1,t5_2qldo

Regardless you can try to upsell with a course that provides some benefit that the book does not. Instructional videos one on one consultation with you and so on. It should be a more personal experience that perhaps fast tracks their learning experience. Often times its where the real money is made. A common example is that McDonalds would lose money if people bought just their burgerscore product. The upsell is the fries and drink side with it.Depending on your niche consultation could also be a standalone service.

4171699,0,t3_38isod,Background Ive been doing freelance Android app development for  years now and freelance web development much longer than that. . Normally I put into the contract that IP transfers from me to the client upon payment. At least for me most of my clients are earlystage software startups looking for prototypes and initial versions  they absolutely must own the IP. Without it they could not continue development with a team of employees and investors  acquirers will check that the startup has complete IP rights and source code for all their products. But perhaps if you are writing internal tools for big nonsoftware businesses then they might not care.. Normally the app is released under the clients app store account. They will want to add their own name emails branding bank accounts etc and its much easier to have it set up properly from the start. Sometimes I put it on mine for very early demos and transfer it over to theirs before launching to the public.. About the same as the initial development. If you are working based on an hourlydailyweekly rate then maintenance and updates are based on time used. If you are working based on fixed quotes then you can offer fixed quotes for proposed updates. I havent done it so far but its not unusual to also have a maintenance retainer contract where you reserve some hours every month for the client on an useitorloseit basis.But to expand on the third point one important decision you need to make for every project is whether to go with timebased billing or fixed quotes. In my experience fixed quotes are better for both sides if there is a very precise description of the end goal with at least pencilandpaper mockups and timebased is better for both sides if changes in the plan are likely.,Entrepreneur,crvs4o7,2,t5_2qldo

Do you really and honestly believe those types of blogs bring value to people? Do you actually get any personal value out of them? And think omg this article is the shit I must make it my guide in order to succeed in life Well most people do not think that about those type of articles.

4286722,0,t3_3a2vg4,Id have to agree with those who have commented before. Youll always see those stories of successful people that dropped out of college and became billionaires or multimillionaires. Can this happen? Sure. If you have the right connections or meet the right people have a good business idea good business sense etc etc etc it can happen. People like the underdog stories.Hindsight to that college can provide some of those resources depending on what college you go to how resourceful you are at meeting people finding the right person to help you or areas to work in. College can provide relationships to potential business partners investors friendships and a variety of other aspects that most dont think about. Most people seem to think college is all about the degree and once you have the degree itll do something for you. Dont think of it that way. Depending on the industry degrees are worthless. For yours CS certifications are needed to prove your worth and knowledge in the industry. I cant tell you how many times my mother told me to go back to school. Youll just have to decide if college is for you or not. Its a personal idea that no one else can make unless your parents MAKE you with a threat of disowning you. I say try out college while working on any side projects. While in college determine what you need to succeed in those side projects and try to excel at each area  Physical or virtual productshardwaresoftware distribution marketingadvertising etc. This will help you start to think of different aspects of running a business.,Entrepreneur,cs8u1y6,2,t5_2qldo

4310126,0,t3_3acjiq,If youre doing anything nontrivial I would highly recommend using a VPS. Ive had great experiences with AWS and DigitalOcean. Those shared hosts that offer simple admin panels are okay for oneoff sites with mostly static content and maybe a simple Wordpress site but if your site gains any sort of momentum you will quickly outgrow them. They also tend to charge you more than what youre getting in return even if they are relatively cheap. Worst of all you have almost zero control over the environment in which your site is running.If youre willing to put in a little bit of effort there are tons and tons of resources out there to help you set up a VPS. For a beginner I would recommend DigitalOcean their user interface is very simple and easy to understand as is their pricing structure. They also have an excellent knowledge base and collection of tutorials here as well as great support.If you sign up with this referral link youll get  in credit. You can also search around and find even more additional coupons. If youre a student apply for the Github Student Pack for  in free credit plus a bunch of other free stuff. Watch out you can only apply ONE coupon code to your account so choose wisely. Next spin up a month Ubuntu droplet and follow this quick tutorial series which will introduce you to your server and help you get it set up initially. Even the month plan will be noticeably faster and more powerful than any shared host around.  Next you can either search the knowledge base or Google for help setting up an application of your choice or follow this one which will get you set up with WordpressFrom there you can experiment with setting up things like PHP Python Node.js an email server ... the sky is the limit. Essentially any problem or question you have youll be able to Google it and find  other question and answers regarding exactly that problem. If you cant find anything youre probably searching for the wrong thing.Not only will you end up with a superb foundation for your websitewebapp youre going to learn a ton of stuff in the process. These are skills that I think any entrepreneur can benefit from whether or not they plan to do all of the techy stuff in the future. It helps to have a good understanding of how this stuff works so that you can more effectively communicate with others without sounding like an idiot.  ,Entrepreneur,csbh74x,6,t5_2qldo

4414711,0,t3_3bjxkb,The Uber of trash?  Sounds viable to me actually.  You could build it out as a marketplace that connects buyers and independent contractors in the same area and then just take a cut of each transaction.  Then go nationwide  international maybe expanding in a radius of your current area to take advantage of network effects.   If you do expand I suspect youll run into regulatory challenges and it takes deep pockets to fight those battles. See Uber.  Negotiating competitive rates from landfills may also be a challenge.  See Anyway in the meantime I understand its just you and your truck.  I have the following suggestions Sure offering a weeklyonly subscription option is a good idea.  Maybe xmo for the first can plus y for each additional can.  Add  for ondemand pickup.  You could also offer a twiceweekly pickup.  But if thats going to take a lot of programming then I would instead concentrate on stacking up the . subscriptions for now.  The more subscribers you have the more revenue you have to fuel growth. Automate as much as possible monthly credit card billing deactivating accounts and emailing the customer when a card fails customer account management etc.  If you try to handle these customer service functions manually you will quickly become overwhelmed and it will hold you back from growing the business.  Stripe can do some of this.  There are probably some other services out there that you can stitch together to avoid reinventing the wheel on your own. Commercial accounts may be easier to land more lucrative and more reliable than residential.  The US Post Office offers a service that allows advertisers to connect with people who have just moved into an area.  That could be a great source of new residential signups.  Get them when theyre first establishing their utility accounts.  Its much harder to get someone to cancel their service and switch to you.  See All in all its a great idea with a lot of potential.  Good luck and keep us posted.,Entrepreneur,csn9tow,2,t5_2qldo

No good leaving it to the owner! How will you do this?. Cost is not an issue. As wow found it in fact it didnt really disrupt the long established traditional estate agent business. In fact people looking to buy in the UK go to  places rightmove.co.uk local estate agent or zoopla.co.ukA similar thing is being tried again here using a minor TV celebrity Sarah Beeny on a site called tepilo.

4437228,0,t1_cspu90q,Grant Respectfully I would disagree. I run our PPC campaign and when weve paid for the data early on we were able to see what was a baseline conversion rate.If your conversion rate is  your CPC is  and your workable margin is  then theres nothing in this formula that works. If you pay  in clicks to get  conversion and lose  as a result thats not due to PPC. Now you can say were not optimizing for the right terms type of traffic demographics etc but were quite optimized in my opinion. Im targeting geographic region time of day day of week age  gender Bing ran quite a few AB tests huge negative KW lists etc. At the end of the day if your competitor knows how to do all of this then theres no secret gold mining area. If you find that theres a slew of people in New York searching for best blue widgets by X on Wednesdays that are hot to buy then youre willing to amp up your bid factor. But if someone else is fighting you for the clicks at that time then theres not much you can do. The real story is that if someone has a far deeper pool of margin to dip into youre screwed even if you have the best PPC guy around.EDIT I just realized you might have been sarcastic after going down the post lists and realizing you were the person that posted later. Its still morning on PST    Actually though since youre a PPC guy I think you would understand this concept far better than I would though. Basically if you take  great PPC guys or really just  or  and put them on a product it will completely ruin it for everyone. Its a game theory similar to prisoners dilemma in that if all PPC campaigns agreed to top out at a CPC everyone would make healthy margins and share the traffic. However one guy starts going up and everyone starts following until they start dropping because theres no more room to move on margin. Now theres  guys cut throat at each other barely squeaking by and another with fair margins but their traffic is in the pits. Thats why I think PPC is like quicksand. Its currently an edge for people that know how to do it. Once everyone is even slightly sophisticated then the game is over. I think thats why Remarketing has had such a huge push because were literally sifting poop for gold now because finding untapped veins is remarkably difficult now.,Entrepreneur,cspzxcy,3,t5_2qldo

Sell your business before your mall lease expires short notice... or sell your inventory.To sell your business based on what youve said you need to capitalize on the greater fool theory. Not that theres anything wrong with that. We all trade what what we have for something else believing we are getting the better bargain. Like others have said your clients may be your best bet for finding a buyer.Look at it this way... If your other option is inventory liquidation at an optimistic K what would you take for your business? k? Dont be greedy. Be reasonable.Alternatively liquidate your inventory wash your hands and move on. Your best bet here may be your competitors. Sell your K of inventory for K and be happy.The reality is the knowledge youve earned in starting the business working the business and selling the business is x more valuable than the college education many high school graduates will be paying for.Do it again.

Itd be like hiring a construction crew before you have a blueprint. One foot before the other.. Not all developers are the same. Much to the dismay of other commenters in this thread developers dont just roll down the assembly line at the factory fixed with all the bells and whistles. They are people. Many of them are very intelligent. Many of them are lazy and rather stupid. It takes years of experience to build a great product alone but more importantly it takes critical foresight and problem solving skills. A bad texhnical partner will waste the little money you have and leave you worse than before you started. Which is why. Dont waste your time trying to learn to build this thing yourself. Focus on being the best fucking product manager you can be. Wireframe it. Think through every page and interaction. Ask for feedback. Document everything clearly  show you have your shit together and have left no stone unturned in planning the future of this thing. Understand metrics  which ones matter and the decisions youll make based on them. Sure a technical partner will make this all easier but you dont have one right now. Everybody has an idea man. Concern yourself with planning the product and if you do that well enough then maybe youll get where you want to go. Good luck ,Entrepreneur,ctip6cs,6,t5_2qldo

I use one of Hivelocitys Webhostingtalk clearance servers amp its nice because I can forward all of my support calls to them amp theyll deal with it. Its essentially money for nothing.If I was in your position I would take inventory of your latest desktops from best to worst amp work out the power cost of running them for a month. If theyre a random clutter of machines itll be a nightmare to do hardware support on all of them. Cooling amp power cost is also going to be a problem if theyre older. Laptops I wouldnt even bother with unless you plan on underclocking most laptops will be locked down though. Even my new Asus gaming laptop has issues with cooling and its pretty beast  I would not depend on it as a server.If you could get some motherboard backplates cut out on a laser cutter amp create some form of clean air wind tunnel with say  rigs setup in a line you might be in pretty good shape. From there id do hosting for PC games. Hosting a game like Terraria would be a good bet because the dedicated server files run on Windows alone They will run on Linux using Mono but its pretty buggy. I assume that all these dual core PCs have Windows license keys correct? Another option would be to offer Steam trade bot hosting which I think could be very lucrative if you have the know how.Hosting is a very competitive business to get into for the lower end guys if you look at the lower end offerings people provide its next to impossible to compete with out heavy investment in hardware amp infrastructure  its almost always better to be a reseller.

The best business model they can come up with is oh well sell ads Well that business model doesnt work. Every app to be successful needs to fit into some sort of business model. The model might be that the app is a loss leader in order to sell other products down the road or as a branding device to garner brand recognition. Or it could be the main revenue source for your business or it could be any number of things. But it needs to be developed within the context of eventually bringing revenue back to the business.

Youre much more likely to get funded if you are building yet another an email marketing and retargeting tool than say a replacement for email.  The former company is much more likely to become a good stable business and return something to an investor. But unlike the latter it almost certainly wont become a billiondollar idea.

Then you can instagram photos of you with local business folk pictures in local stores holding the items youre going to put in this months box etc.  Right now your instagram is a bunch of photos of helicopter views of the city and frankly I dont think anyone cares about that.  Your tagline GIVE THE GIFT OF ROCHESTER IN A BOX doesnt tell me what the heck your product is as a layman that isnt familiar with the City in a box business.  Maybe something like Native Rochester specialties in your mailbox every month or Sample the life of a New Yorker from Rochester to your mailbox every month etc. I think fitting in New York and New Yorker into your copy might add some clarity and flair.

5069004,0,t1_cuwt7q2,Im just getting started with the idea though so Im still working through it. Im not a programmer at all and have no experience in that area but Im willing to learn. Itll be a website where people can create their own courses and upload and where we work with content creators to create specific courses. Creators will receive a good amount of commission. So pretty much like Lynda.com or Udemy but within a niche. Not much in terms of startup funds  but probably around  or so. I could stretch this to  if need be. Long term plan Im not clear on yet as I only had the idea today  but ill be trying to bring a specific niche to the masses and make it accessible. I dont really know what my options are however to create such a website  but the main thing is itll be a course website that is an integration of the above websites but in a specific niche.,Entrepreneur,cux08mj,1,t5_2qldo

Not my content not a lawyer but heres another perspective Attorney with securities transaction experience and some SEC regulation fluency checking inIve actually been doing some more research on the guy at work today and am pretty blown away at how this all went down.Id like to state first that hes a total cunt but its becoming more and more clear that he intended for all of this to happen  and knew the  costfloor revaluation was an embellishment with a purposeHe has from what I can find    million in shares of borrowed stock in various pharma corp. entities.So the moment reddit started circlejerking about the injustice to the AIDS victims and someone on Hilarys digital media team said Mrs. Clinton  appeal to all these voters by shitting on this dude! he cracked a beer and watched his whole plan unfold. In realistic share terms taking taxes interest rates in the ST contract with his lenders and estimated holding into account is probably several million dollars in profit for a day of acting. Someone above said hell make billions shortselling! Not only could he not make that much on a  drop short sale with his highest estimated borrowed holding but the profit from a short sale like this doesnt come to light for the market player until days weeks even months later when the price is back up to optimal value for cashing out.So its safe to say that he made millions with his little PR stunt and vocationally in a vacuum hes fucking brilliant. Again universally  hes a cunt but has an undeniable vocational aptitude for what he does.He knew hed announce this cost reduction and caving on the k value inflation shortly after reddit twitter mainstream media and Hilary all started airing out their grievances   and he knew that there would be a subsequent revitalization in the pharma. share market base. Bada bing bada boom. Say what you want about this guy but he just acted like a cunt in order to troll the outrage bandwagon into actually influencing share values and it fucking worked. He didnt deprive any dying children he didnt put anyone on the street he probably didnt even leave his fucking office. Alas the predictable freakout hit the exact water mark he wanted it to maybe even higher and he bought all he could at the low price the bandwagon created flipped back his  million in borrowed shares to his creditors with presumably a lets do business again real soon interest rate and will soon profit generously when the market settles back to its regular CFS. It really is impressive entirely because of the ignorance that is the foundation of everyones outrage. I see a lot of people pissing and moaning about the system and the extortion and the broken justice of SEC regs and no suggestions other than fuck this psychopath. Ya know what the ironic thing about this situation is though? His play will encourage the SEC revision committee to act. Not PI groups not activists not media attention. But this guy who took advantage of the volatility of the market in response to uninformed social justice outcry. The only thing that really gets the attention of the SEC revision committee is economic circumstances and the potential to not have firm control over happenings in private trading.From    the SEC Regulatory Revision Committee has instituted  major acts all in response to participant profiting no one went to prison and ALL THE ACTS were in the interest of noncorporate market participants.Like it or not hes the only one wholl make a difference for the better whether its his intention or not  and hes getting rich while hes doing it and not actually acting any differently than  of the other AIDS med manufacturers in the industry. In fact hes lowered his price below many others.,Entrepreneur,cvc9ynr,1,t5_2qldo

5241836,0,t1_cvhrsxm,So I took the leap this year to leave my job and work on my own. From my own experience and in talking with other entrepreneurs this is what I have generally foundTaking the leap doesnt make your life happier. You have to have a certain personality for it. Im fortunate in that it suits me and the ups and downs havent really been that stressful for me. But its more because Im content with the lifestyle than because of any successes Ive had in entrepreneurship. I think this distinction is key. You may want to be an entrepreneur but the stress of being able to support yourself might not allow you to see it all the way through.Youre in some great jobs to learn many of the skills that will benefit you as an entrepreneur. Take advantage of that. You can also build up savings for when you take the leap and you give yourself a good fallback to return back to these companies or this line of work if you have to down the line. If entrepreneurship is going to be your game in life I think its about managing the risks so that you can keep playing.Learning about entrepreneurship can take a long time. I love watching Shark Tank. I used to be amazed at the guts of some of the people pitching on the show. Now I think many of them are ridiculously unprepared through no fault of their own except they jumped into business without learning enough about it. Go to meetups take online courses read blogs and listen to podcasts. Tell people what you are trying to do. There are a ton of people willing to give you sound advice on the journey. Be actively learning. Or JUST GO FOR IT. As much as Ive taken a reasoned and cautious approach things would have worked out pretty much the same if Id gone for it earlier on in my totally unscientific assessment. Youre probably still young enough to bounce back from a bunch of mistakes. That in itself is something that is hard to take advantage of as time goes on. Just make sure your pursuits are genuine. If you take the leap and just spin your wheels you wont be really helping yourself. If you launch something  anything  or raise money or run something for awhile and it doesnt work out youll have developed skills that you can apply to a regular career. So you wont starve...probably. ,Entrepreneur,cvhtxfa,1,t5_2qldo

It will bring you longterm high quality traffic that converts well but it takes about  months to get noticed by Google and gain some momentum. If you dont know what youre doing SEOwise I would double that timeframe.  DIY is all about video so make a youtube channel and create high quality videos with a link pointing towards your website. This will bring targeted traffic and also some search engine juice.Theres a channel on Youtube where a guy talks solely about vacuums. But his information is accurate and helpful so people love it.

5248494,0,t1_cvhmk0n,Exactly! But if I get like  friends to help me out in the beginning until I know if it will be profitable shouldnt I just get it out everywhere right away? Because somebody else will  try the same as me and if I only deliver for  restaurants it will be so easy to do things better than me! I would  much rather buy delivery from a company that delivers for all the restaurants available than a small company that only has  restaurants that I dont even buy from. Even when the company with  restaurants makes all the restaurants available I have already connected and tried the other company and would much more likely use it. Lets say I get  orders from  pm! That is  orders an hour although there most likely will be most orders from  pm! But I think  orders an hour for  perhaps even  people should be easy enough! That is  orders per driver per hour! That is nothing! The  cost will most likely be less than enough but I would also be more likely to get people to use me the cheaper I am right? There are not many expenses really only gas for the car? And then the salary of the drivers but in the beginning I would be using my friends who most likely would be willing to do it for nothing or almost nothing! So after a while now I get like  orders a night and on FridayampSaturday I get  orders! At that moment I will be having drivers who get salary!  a night! Of that there is  gas money and then  to each driver in payment. That is  in profit! The people ordering are happy because the food is delivered on time and cheaply delivered! The drivers are happy because they basically do nothing and get paid and I am happy because  a day is more than enough! And if I keep my  dayjob too that would be even better!Would restaurants be interested in paying me to deliver for them? Would they be willing to pay me like  for each delivery? Yeah of course that makes sense! If the order is so big it makes the driver unable to have any other orders with him it should be higher charged!  ,Entrepreneur,cvimry9,1,t5_2qldo

You wont get there overnight but if you dont know what it looks like youll never get there.So as you say  is the most you could handle yourself? That means by the time you get  you have to be earning enough to hire another crew so that you can free yourself up to get out there to find the next  right?A couple caveats to that. One is that the first hire will be the most expensive because youll have the smallest client base to distribute the costs across. It should get easier each time after that. Second it doesnt necessarily have to be a  solution. Maybe you can over book and make to to  or  hand off  and then run at  personal allocation to continue to grow.The other opportunity is to look at how to increase efficiency so that you have a processsystem in place that allows your new crews to support  at a time instead of .The two ways to increase profit are to reduce costs increase efficiency or charge more.

I looked at your pictures before going to your website so I would have a better perspective if I was just a random customer who decided to walk in. When I walked in it wasnt immediately clear what the productservice was or how it worked. I could certainly guess that it had products that remind you offrom Baltimore inside a cool box. But how do you buy it? Do you just buy what you want off the shelves and then you put it in a box? Do I go up to the counter and ask to buy a box? Do you have boxes prepackaged that I buy? To me it kind of gives off the vibe Oh yea just check out our website and order online versus being a niche retail store. I would just try to make your offering more immediately apparent. You could make a sign saying something like Buy a Box or Make a Box that is front and center with some boxes premade and an empty box next to some products. The other thing I would suggest is to get product off the lower shelves I promise you that no one wants to stoop down to buy a food product thats  off the floor and either fill taller shelves with lots of products or take most of the products off the shelves and just display them around perhaps stack them on your super cool box wall? to show the customer what you can put in them. Either way I would recommend placing more boxes with product inside on display. But seriously congratulations. This is a really cool idea and Im glad you have been so successful at it!

The process will be very similar if you have a partner the only difference is you need to make sure you have an operations agreement written out so you know who owns what as well other other legal things for this I would go to a lawyer and have them help you it should cost you a few hundred bucks to have one written by a lawyer and it is worth every penny.

So far Ive looked high and low and there is not a service like this for that area. There are TONS in California and other states but not here not sure why there isnt a service like this available in my area because there are tons people in such a small area with a lot of great restaurants that do not deliver.

5383168,0,t1_cvzqxw7,Yes you see this was what I was thinking! When I was doing my research for my specific niche I noticed that a majority of these high traffic websites although had a Social Section The lack of support they had in terms of monitoring the topics as well as the overall traffic was low.For example This is my conclusion from multiple Websites I researchedContains over  Forum Sections. However lacked in terms of conversational posts.So for every forum there was maybe about  topics posted per section. It looked bad and poorly reflected an impression with me but then again thats just me. As much as Id like to have a sort of conversational platform open I guess it would depend on the amount of traffic and support. I can look at maybe creating google groups later down the road? The last thing I want to do is put the cart before the horse. However its hard to determine what to provide and what to hold off on until later. I dont like the fact that others in my industry would have it I wouldnt have a section for that.

Use some title and subtitles preferably your slogan on your homepage to make a better first impression and value proposition this will lower your bounce rate and increase conversions. It is difficult to read menu items try to have a better contrast between the navigation items and slider image. On product pages it is always good idea to stick the regular style and put image to the left and CTA buttons to right.

5573496,0,t3_3rgjij, Transparently define the standards of your organization according to your goals and market the problem as much more than even as you market the organization itself. Bringing attention to a problem with a simple solution is easier than selling a brand especially in a market with significantly less potential revenue. Turn donations and grants into paychecks. If you pay someone  a week to help write grants and distribute goods it is just as valuable to your organizations goals as distributing  of goods. Dont let public perception scare you in the long run creating jobs only adds to your reputation. I worked for an organization that pulled in k each year from donations and grants with the work done entirely by volunteers. They failed to expand to meet demand because they were unwilling to pay a  salary for a hrweek executive director. Their branding failed their networking failed and they burnt out their small volunteer pool in a city of only k residents no less because they expected too much for nothing in return. The cruel irony is that they received a  bequest  enough to fund two fulltime employees for a year and still have money to spare. They squandered the opportunity because they behaved like martyrs see below Dont expect more than a few hours per month hell even per year from one volunteer. Performing a service does not mean youre obligated to keep doing it! Youre better off getting a hundred hours from a hundred people anyway because it helps build wordofmouth recognition. Dont be afraid to make money for your work. Use the structure of the organization to your advantage! There are taxexempt organizations for a reason and they benefit longterm by creating jobs! If you are committed to the cause then trust yourself to make ethical decisions about what you are worth to the company. Lastly dont be a martyr. You didnt cause the problem you didnt stack the system and you are not responsible for every failure to provide. But you ARE responsible for every need you fill and thats awesome!,Entrepreneur,cwnxzf2,1,t5_2qldo

5623603,0,t3_3s3x5k,The main goal you have relationships amp love advice is a very profitable market. Look at all the websites making millions by creating a match making software. Your idea on the other hand may need some tweaking. Also based on your brief description of yourself I think you might need to hear this. . If you want to get into the business of match making or relationship advice you do not need to be an expert but you will need to be somewhat knowledgeable about the subject.. Do your research first and see what appeals to your market and then base your product off that. There are plenty of men like you in the same situation. . How weird would it be if I just offered suggestions without any solutions. At this point you may be too shy for this but I have seen people monetize this market in some unique ways. If I were you I would look into Simple Pickup on Youtube they are a little aggressive in their approach but are genuine and have life lessons that you should learn if you want to be in this market. One point to make is that their demographic is exactly what who you would be selling to. Look at the comments and take key questions that people are asking and make note of them. In terms of a product you will have to make something more modern. For an example tshirts with pickup lines on them which is something easy to start out with but! selling tshirts is a saturated market and you definitely should build a fan base first before thinking about selling.,Entrepreneur,cwu5tr8,1,t5_2qldo

5717912,0,t1_cx5ubfp,There really isnt a perfect plan to go ahead but id be glad to give you my pathI spent about  months learning on coding websites started out on codeacademy which i realize now is a pretty big waste of time as they teach in a vacuum then i moved on to Teamtreehouse.com which definitely boosted me. After about  months and building stupid website after stupid website which is how you improve just making anything no matter how dumb it is I signed up for a coding school in San Francisco. I passed the entrance exam did the month of prelearning and then spent  months  hours a day days a week immersed in coding and instruction. Thats pretty much it I took the quick route and I know a TON of stuff some of it pretty irrelevant in my position but if you want to go full fledged full stack its not a bad way to go. You can make websites and learn basic javascript without a school but if you want to learn about prototypal inheritance linked lists node chains etc. then a school can boost you through.The biggest advice i can give when learning to code is understand that you dont realize what you are learning learning to code is unlike any other thing as you will build  websites in a row have practically done nothing different but you actually learned a ton.

I imagine the armed forces have their bases covered in providing fatigues and armor that fit. I was thinking more of ergonomics. For example a petite female might find it easier to wear M magazines lower on their chest than a  man might do to the different distances and heights between the shoulder and mag well and the length of the magazine.

You buy a very reasonable house lets say  with a very reasonable car lets say  and we round that up to . You now have . million in the system. off that principal amount is  per year. Make sure you leave it in there for one year longterm capital gains and aftertax youre looking at a takehome of  per year. With that amount a house and car you own no matter what happens youll be able to weather any storm. You can go back to work if you enjoy that you can sit at home and play video games all day long if you like that. Either way youre in a position that nobody gets to tell you how to live your life.Thats of course assuming that you have . million saved up. Adjust accordingly.

Transcribe does seem widely used and as its priced  I think you could charge more than that especially if the pitch detection is good. The musician part of me is a bit skeptical of polyphonic pitch detection in general but something like Melodyne definitely shows the technology is improving in leaps and bounds.

And no idea no matter how exciting sexy and potentially profitable will matter if you cant answer this question for yourself.I can anticipate your response I just want to bounce a few ideas and hopefully one will stick more than the others because.... I get it. You want something that has been vetted by someone and seems sexy. You want people to do your research for you because it is terrifying beginning something just to see that something seems more profitable or seems more interesting. And I know you want to have a business all boxed up ready to go so you can accelerate your earnings and build something that scales.But lets be real here. The first year is less about actually building and scaling the business and more about feeling the pressure and creating intuition to become a true entrepreneur.

6026611,0,t3_3y05bf,I think you may be underestimating how competitive lead generation is online.  It is hyper competitive.  I suspect youre also underestimating the problems youre getting in to.  Are you going to use an affiliate system to sell your leads?  Or sell them directly to purchasers?Lemme tell you a cautionary tale.  I used to generate leads in a competitive industry I was and am very good at it.  Sold the leads directly to salespeople.  I had problems getting paid ongoing complaints and whining about valid leads.  Whats a valid lead?  Well I generated a real name and a real phone number and sold it.  The rep called that person answered and admitted to completing the form.  The rep called and wanted their money back.  This was apparently an invalid lead since the person wasnt interested in the product.    Thats the kind of bullshit youre surfing your life towards.  Lead gen is not a fun business and I think its way harder than it looks.Im not an expert on lead gen outside my field but this is what Ive been told secondhand.  You need high volume low return leads or low volume high return leads.   For example I once met someone who did lead gen for some high end equipment.  he got about  leads a year but on average the lead was worth  figures.I have a friend who does offline lead gen for a generator company.  My friend drives truck to grocery stores.  When he delivers the goods he often hands a business card to the store owner for the generator company.  Some of the store owners call the generator company and have expensive backup generators installed.  My friend says he makes K or so per lead that uses his name.  Thats an example of something  no competition at all online low volume but reasonably high payout.  If youre thinking youre going to  get into car insurance lead gen or something well I wouldnt touch it with a  foot pole. Too many people doing it and theyre all smarter and more aggressive than I am.,Entrepreneur,cy9lyty,1,t5_2qldo

Have an email optin for people to sign up.  Share on your social media. Email  friends and family or colleagues that you know would be interested in the product telling them personally that you think they would be interested in this and if they like it it would be great for them to pass it on to anyone else they think might be interested. If you see people signing up maybe reach out to the first ten fifty or hundred to ask hey why did you sign up or thank you for signing up etc. Make them feel engaged.Honestly getting emails from a landing page is a GREAT validation method almost next to none except perhaps getting sales! I used Unbounce which cost  a month. I found a promo code that makes it  a month for  months.

CMEAs appropriate handling of this matter is evidenced by the fact that for the last  months plaintiffs continued working for the Firm without incident each of them resigning only after the acrosstheboard change in the Firms overtime policy and only after filing this lawsuit last month.

6182714,0,t1_cysc9yp,Honestly I remember a pdf or a website that had a list of different pricing strategies but I dont remember it. A quick Google search on psychology of product pricing should give you plenty of information. It has to do with your brain seeing the numbers as different values. For instance  may be more than  but  is also known as the number before the next higher up number  before   before . So your brain immediately thinks that . is a good deal because the price is below the next number up which would be . Reason I say . instead of . is because when your brain sees . it knows thats extremely close to  because of the repeating s. But when your brain sees . it reads the last number as a better value because  is less than . You can also do . but since the transition from  to  doesnt seem as big as  to  the . actually works better and . works better for the reason above. Lots of strategies in pricing. ,Entrepreneur,cyses5c,1,t5_2qldo

6206111,0,t1_cytz2o6,This absolutely. Ive spent a fair amount of time putting together SOPs for different processes Ive been able to outsource to socalled Virtual Assistants. A good rule of thumb is this the less skilled your contractor the more detailed your instructions need to be for each task. That may mean spending hours taking screenshots from your computer to show a contract exactly where he needs to click the mouse. In cases like these your instructions need to be thorough enough that you could give them to just about anyone and have them successfully complete the task assigned without needing to meet that person facetoface or walk them through the process by phone. Of course you might find a contractor has questions about the instructions. And its a good idea to revise the instructions to clarify this. My instructions are typically evolving and improving as they become more involved and expand to include other tasks in the same area.,Entrepreneur,cyv2heu,2,t5_2qldo

6387815,0,t3_434f4d,Back in  I got into the iPhone unlocking business.  I got in literally the same day the first free software unlock became available and around a week after the controversial  price cut.At the time eBay required PayPal and only allowed PayPal to be accepted for iPhones.  There was no exception to this rule even for established eBay sellers like myself.  That wasnt really a problem since I preferred it over checks and money orders anyway.  I would list my phones with Featured Plus! which cost almost  in extra fees.  This feature would make the listing highlighted and appear at the top of search results not always but most of the time.  Since I was having a lot of problems with people buying my phones and not paying I made it immediate payment required you should always use this setting anyway.  I was selling one or two or unlocked phones per day and it became the bulk of my revenue.  It also pushed me into the Gold Powerseller  level which meant I got my own account representative for free.Then one day I got an email from a potential customer who wanted  phones.  He said he was blocked from buying my phones.  When I checked my PayPal account it showed my account was limited and they required documentation from me which included my personal info.  That was fine so I sent it to them.  In the meantime I had a sale in Russia that I couldnt print shipping labels for through PayPal because you cant use limited funds to buy shipping labels why?.  And of course PayPal labels were the only way to ship to Russia at the time since Endicia Stamps.com and USPS.com all blocked Russia labels.  Two days later I got an email telling me I was limited and they required my personal information and receipts for goods receipts showing everything bought and receipts for everything that had been shipped.  I sent them my info again along with receipts from Apple my other suppliers and receipts for shipments dating back  years and through the present.  Basically everything I had.  A few days later I got the same email again this time asking for receipts for specific shipments which included my Russia buyer that I couldnt ship to.  I explained that I they themselves prevented me from shipping that but provided everything else.  On day  of my  day listing they finally lifted my restriction allowing me to get one sale out of that listing.The real issue though was with eBay.  They owned PayPal at the time.  While all this was going on I contacted my new account representative and requested a fee credit.  I understood why the limit happened but I said Id paid them over  for this listing their rules require me to accept PayPal and they are refusing to let me use PayPal.  This means Im paying them over  and getting absolutely nothing in return.  That shouldnt be allowed and I believe I could have sued them successfully over it though it obviously wouldnt have been worth it.  But instead of rectifying the issue or even empathizing with my situation the representative simply told me he could do nothing about that or the fees I had paid them and that I needed to fix my PayPal issues instead.  The whole situation cost me several hundred dollars in lost revenue but I also paid eBay for virtually nothing.  I was a very loyal eBay seller up to that point.  A year later I had completely closed my business.Looking at the lawsuit Im only entitled to .,Entrepreneur,czfq82v,3,t5_2qldo

6395778,0,t1_czglzm5,I appreciate you commenting!gt Im not sure why you keep going back to the analog concept of cards. Is a card gamelike functionality essential? Ive played a couple of iOS cardbased games and been really bored by them they were not welldeveloped or even fun so even if this is good I would have a resistance to trying it based on card game.I use the term card game because I feel like thats just how it portrays the application the best. I get bored with card games easily too however I would say that this application will be less of a card game and more of a fantasy type rpg but the main focus is the cards. When you have an item and you need to have stats correlating with that item its easily represented in a single card. Were hoping the functionality and the amount of tasks available in this application will reduce being bored. And were only really going for an application that people use when theyre bored. Kind of like a checkin every once in a while but keep coming back to better your character.gt Does this game fill a hole in the market? Is there a need for this game?Thats the goal. I have yet to see an online application similar to this concept. If you have please enlighten me I would love to check it out.gt What is your target demographic?Most likely going for the younger audience that is interested in that fantasy sort of style. However like myself we are going for an audience that grew up in the d rpg era.gt Could you build this game so it could be easily skinned and repackaged adding an additional revenue stream from white label licensing of the code?Absolutely. Its developed as a web application making most of the code php. All of the systems features and algorithms could be easily transferred to another project. Hopefully I understood that question correctly.gt Is there a single player mode or a discovery mode for other players so if someones friends dont want to play they can still find a group?Internet connection is required but yes there will be a looking for group menu or you dont even ever really need to join a group unless you want to get serious about the app or if you want to play with your friends.gt Could I be playing in several groups at the same time?As of now no. We look at it more in like a guild setting where you commit to one group and basically compete against all the other groups.This process of early registering is really only to open up the concept to a bunch of people and see from others perspectives whether this actually is a good idea or not.,Entrepreneur,czgmua9,2,t5_2qldo

The Typeface is too small on your hero banner actually all of it as I scroll down the page could be a bit bigger to make it easier to read for people with sight problems or older people etc.. Drop down menus could use a bit of UX Design on them.. Footer could use a bit more symmetry with the items rather than having them all clamped on the left. just cosmetic stuff not a big gripe though.

Second Reddit is the last place on the internet where people can easily attempt to market their ideas or products to lots of consumers for free.

Anything you do before then is throwing money down the drain... if you have no idea what your target CPA is you have no clue what your ROI is on each ad. How are you meant to optimize anything not knowing those numbers? Having massive margins on free traffic doesnt mean ANYTHING when translated to buying paid traffic. Traffic cost is unpredictable and depends on so many factors its not funny. You would likely be better off hiring a dedicated media buyer to manage everything for you. The premium price could even be raised  if you ran tests its actually likely you would find there isnt much difference in terms of conversion rate so your EPCearnings per click would go way up on  vs . or . Lower recurring price points are weird like that  as long as its under  most people see it as a set and forget charge. OP Im telling you from extensive experience that for paid traffic its extremely likely that Facebook and Google will be your lifeblood. The targeting options are second to none and you cant get that kind of volume anywhere else. Pinterest Instagram Twitter... all of these traffic sources should be used AFTER a FacebookGoogle campaign had been dialed in. You want to be swinging for the fences not using the little brothers and sisters of FaceGoogle. Source spent k on paid traffic in the last  months and no Im not trying to drum up business. ,Entrepreneur,czwlf41,18,t5_2qldo

Furthermore the copy on the page is really really offputting and should probably be rephrased. As someones girlfriend I would hate to find out that my boyfriend thinks of me as confusing time consuming and difficult even if I can be sometimes and I highly doubt he would consider himself Lazy if hes making a concentrated effort to spice up the relationship. I think your niche here would be to provide customization of some sort...its really hard to make blanket statements about relationships and then translate those into material things. Maybe if you had like an editorial quiz of some sort users could take to determine what type the girlfriend is outdoorsyculinary whizmovie loversports fanaticect and then send a box of itemsdate ideas each month based on the results...there could be two or three different types of boxes to choose from for girlfriends who fall into multiple categories. This would be great because if there were some tougher questions on the quiz the bf might not know the answer to like of the question was whether she preferred silver or gold jewelry it would help to start a conversation between the couple and in getting to know each other better it would lead to more effective gift giving in the future for both parties.,Entrepreneur,d02mzlc,11,t5_2qldo

Couple key things you need to do to prepare  Your Elevator Pitch. If youre not familiar an elevator pitch is what you would say to someone asking about your product as the name implies in an elevator. It has to be short and to the point. Practice that every chance you get.  Demo  ideally offline. A big part of saas sales is the demo. Youll want to eliminate as many problems ahead of time as possible. One of those is connectivity. Build out a server on your pc its ok if it doesnt have all the features its just a demo. Credit to Guy Kawasaki and the art of the start . for this idea.  Your close  how are you going to convert? Do you need their email them to sign up? Whatever it is have it ready and easy to access. Tips  Keep in mind Small business owners get pitched every day. Their phone numbers are online for customers but get called all the time by salespeople.  Go to them hat in hand. Youre a college student trying to make something of his or herself. Tell them you want their help and input. You actually need it. To answer your question . Begin the discussion by telling them about yourself. . Then tell them the story of where this idea came from .

Leveraging that might be interesting by using the money to buy a bunch of old books and paying people to test fold the different patterns and photograph them.

6916315,0,t3_4aerfl,So the very first thing entrepreneurs need to learn is ...Marketing. Ive noticed that the entrepreneurs who succeed typically have either an innate ability to sell charisma or like myself theyve dug into a lot of marketing training and figured out how to A identify and place their offer in front of their target market and Bhow to convert those people into customers. Some great placesResources that have helped me in thisMarketing for Dummies  Im amazed at how little I know sometimes. I even reread it occasionally.   Its  a month so hop in bust out the courses and move forward   This course was my breakthrough. SEO lets you use time to get low dollarcost traffic This gives a lot of leeway to have poor conversions and still make a profit. This source also has a monthly fee. Get in get the info and move forward. SmartPassiveincome of course interviews a lot of great folks and johnnyFd.com is a littleknown dude who has good folks on his show all the time. I recommend that for the first few businesses you dont try to reinvent the wheel. Most entrepreneurs are trying to create the next Facebook when they dont have the marketing skills to successfully run a lawn mowing company. So once youve gotten the marketing basics down Id suggest starting aa simple boring business  and using that as your internship. My Entrepreneur journey started in earnest on April th . On April th   after some really freaking huge failures  I finally got the marketing right and was able to quit my job and  months later was making .x my old jobs income. So stay after it.

6933698,0,t1_d127pk8,. I almost felt like Tom from Parks and Rec the last few years. Years ago I started a social media marketing company. I got a solid list of clients especially after I won the Wicked Smart competition at the end of a conference in  called the Traffic and Conversion Summit by Ryan Deiss. I ended up almost being scared of my success and someone offered me the lead marketing position at a startup. The startup was called FreeAppADay and it made millions before changes Apple made to the App Store algorithm leading to the rise in the freemium model and the end of our business model. After that I tried affiliate marketing and launched a few websites. But ultimately I was riding on what I knew were good business ideas but not really my passion. I also launched a travel blog as I was traveling around Europe. Right when it started to get noticed I realized I would rather be known for something more than my ability to travel. I wanted to do something bigger... something that would really help people. So the previous founder of FreeAppADay along with a few other people and I set off on the Lenny journey.. I would pick The Power. While it wasnt necessarily my favorite in the end it was the first and exactly what I needed to change my mindset. My favorites were probably Start with Why and Think and Grow Rich. Also I forgot to list this but the MOST lifechanging for me was Autobiography of a Yogi.. At Lenny because its a startup we all have our hands in everything. I designed the original wireframe and initial designs. Now my job title is Director of Media. I handle all of our content public speaking PR initiatives ambassador program and currently even customer service.. We do have plans for Android within the next    months.. Currently we are lending of our balance sheet but we are setting up an SPV where other investors including hedge funds will be participating in the loan financing.. Yes we do have plans for investor funding. We have been relying heavily on our own resources initially so that we have more control over the product while we collect data.Thanks for all the questions!

You can react accordingly and feel disgusted or not.  If they are just people who are impressed by your success and therefore want to be closer to someone they admire then theres no real harm in it.  In a completely different but useful example I was very fat in high school.  At some point in college I lost a ton of weight amp got pretty strong. Out of nowhere people wanted to be friends with me amp even people who were mean to me became nicer  men and women.  I came to realize that its mostly not that they wanted anything.  Theyre just socially taught to be assholes to those who have traits they dont want and to put those who have traits they do want on a pedestal.

7007602,0,t3_4bluse,Presumably your girlfriend has to have products hair extensions as part of her work. My recommendation would be to approach this as a service and retail operation if possible given your time allowance. She could sell the hair extensions online and have those berpopular hair extension youtube influencers to promote the products she has. Drive that traffic to the ecommerce site by providing the influencer with an incentive for driving their viewers to your website maybe through a discount code or something for some of the products. This way you have some revenue coming in through product that she already has. The service part can then be microtargeted on FacebookTwitterYelp to drive people towards the service angle of the business. You could show instructional videos as your marketing strategy maybe even use YouTube as your primary marketing channel in order to build up trust. Combine these instructional videos with your product pages in order to sell more product by showing people outside of your locale how to put the extensions in themselves and use that authority that youll build over time to convert more local people to the service she provides locally.

7132726,0,t3_4d796p,They do sell soup in tetra packs.  They seem to be fairly popular and sell for a big premium over canned soup.One issue I see with glass bottles in UV light.  Im no soup expert but I would imagine UV light could have a very negative effect on the shelf life of certain soups.  You can get around this by using dark green or brown glass but then you would lose the advantage of people being able to see the product before purchase.Also glass has a few disadvantages over other containers.  You will have higher breakage higher shipping costs since glass weighs a bit bigger carbon footprint and you will also need to dedicate space for storing empty bottles before filling.As a premium product it could work but it would have to be really good soup.  I think a plastic bottle would be the far better option.So lets say you figure out your packaging get some great recipes and you manage to secure a commercial kitchenbottling plant.  Now you need to market your product.You can try to sell online but personally I feel food doesnt sell very well online.  So you probably want to get your product on store shelves.Im not sure if you are aware of this but most grocery stores charge rent on their shelf space with some shelves much more expensive than others.  In case you are curious breakfast cereal is the most expensive.The soup market is very competitive with a few very big players dominating sales.  The big guys are great at bullying the little guys.  They will get the best shelves they will steal your ideas and they will generally just be dicks to you.   This doesnt mean a little guy cant break into the market and be successful but its a huge uphill battle.Now you have a product a place to sell it and well assume you are priced appropriately this leaves the hard part promotion.Im going to make an assumption and assume you will have a bare bones promotion budget.  With a small budget that means youre going to be doing a lot of hustling.  Youre going to have to hit up the radio stations go on crappy local morning shows give out samples at the grocery store on weekends and pretty much spend the rest of your time on social media.Your last question is about demand.  Yes the demand for packaged soup is huge.  Most grocery stores dedicate a good amount of shelf space for soup and its pretty hard to watch a half hour of TV without seeing an ad for soup.  But as I stated before the few really big players fill the vast majority of the demand.I never like to discourage people from chasing their dreams but if this is just a whim I would look for an easier market to enter.,Entrepreneur,d1owtvf,4,t5_2qldo

7152172,0,t3_4dhyf1,Hey Im from the UK too.Why are you operating as a limited company? I took a look at your abbreviated accounts and it looks like you made a loss last year. I imagine you paid around k for accountancy fees? Thats an unnecessary cost. Youre also a little restricted in what you can take from the business. If you operated as a sole trader your accountancy fees would be lower and there would be fewer admin fees to pay for  a few pounds saved there.You can also offset the loss sideways against your other income PAYE income for example. This means you can reclaim some of the tax you paid at your main employment. Unfortunately as a Ltd co there isnt much you can do with a loss until you make a profit. Maybe if you continue you could talk to your accountant and ask for his opinion?I too like your website. A few little things could be tidied up but compared to most of the websites on here yours is very good. There must be some value in this to someone if you did decide to close up.Im sure you know already but there are a lot of websites like yours operating in that sector. What makes you different? Can you sing and dance about that to everyone and come in at a different angle to competitors? I bought some designer sunglasses a while back. I only did as they were a great offer so Im probably not your perfect customer but I did pick up on their marketing  a few days after my purchase I received and email asking to leave a review on Trust Pilot  if I did I could win my purchase. Great way to get people to leave reviews which make you more credible. But TP costs about  a year  so be careful!They also hit me with a referral marketing campaign straight after I purchased offering a  amazon voucher if I refered a friend  thats pretty good as it goes! Id be interested in seeing your full accounts if of course you wanted to speak about it. I imagine your margins are quite big being designer products?

If you can minimise your admin costs then you can focus on making a profit on the core product.,Entrepreneur,d1r4pga,1,t5_2qldo

I work as a motion designer and editor  did ten years at a national ad agency and have been freelancing for the past two helping people create video content to generate interest and add legitimacy to their online presence with sleek graphics.  Video creation is a great skill to learn as OP said  and theres so many tutorials available online at little to no cost that just about anyone with a computer can get into it. But it takes a lot of experience and talent for a hobbyist to compete with companies who have their own dedicated media departments.  Plus you may just not have a passion for it  and thats ok  I certainly outsource a lot of my accounting so I can focus on what I love  the creative side of it animating logos creating infographics titles fixing bad lighting with color correction etc.What Im getting at is while at the end of the day content is king its also got to look good if you want people to trust you. If its poorly shot with bad graphics why should a consumer assume you dont cut corners in other aspects of your business? Video creation and post production is my passion I love the technical side of it as well as the creative and Im always looking for opportunities to collaborate. I didnt intend for this to be self promotion but hey this is Entrepreneur! but if anyone needs help with their video content please feel free to message me.

Hed have managerial authority and I would have practice authority. I dont know if this is legally meaningful. As per our discussions Id be the primary medical and practice decision maker with his ability to veto. So in other words what he is saying is that in   split deal he still retains control.

People who havent donated yet.Try giving away value and getting these people really connected. Give them lots of value and thank them for following the project. Let them know you care about their support. Maybe theyll donate later or share your project with a friend. Large DonorsLarge donors often make or break projects. You should have an exclusive newsletter Google Hangout etc. for these people. Let them know youve noticed their generous donation.

Has there ever BEEN an Entrepreneur who didnt stretch the truth about their work history qualifications job skills their service their product their numbers or ANYTHING?  We are talking about a mindset where if youre not exaggerating and bending rules youre not trying hard enough.  So many companies started in houses and garages in violation of local zoning code ordinances  Office spaces full of card tables with laptops on them and network cables hanging everywhere  a mad rush to acquire users get sales and become profitable that ask forgiveness not permission is really the rule and not the exception.    For every singleproprietor with an idea and a lot of ambition there are voicemail  virtual pbx companies offering press  for sales press  for ..   There are companies like Squarespace Shopify Volusion BigCommerce AmazonFBA all hiding the fact that your giant designer lawn furniture company is just you and your wife ordering injection molded plastic  MOQ at a time and selling it out of your garage.

And if you dont want to test  versions of something you can always scale back the variations to something where you feel you are getting meaningful results.At the risk of sounding scientific and pulling things out of my ass... As to how much traffic it takes for multivariate analysis to yield meaningful results consider the University of Iowa experiment featured in Blinkgt Card decks some favorable some not were given to subjects whose hand palms were wired to sweat detectors. The subjects were asked to place bets on the cards uncovered in sequential order. It typically took  cards for normal people to develop a hunch about each deck and  cards for them to be sure which what was going on with the deck they were using and to verbalize it. However the experiment showed that experienced gamblers developed an unconscious hunch in about  cards based on their sweating palms.It doesnt take a huge amount of traffic to begin recognizing which variables are influencers.But youre right maybe all my tool will prove is that we already know everything about landing page optimization.,Entrepreneur,d3dtlyf,1,t5_2qldo

Forex trades heavily on technical analysis which basically means you can predict what is going to happen accurately more times than not by reading the charts and looking at different indicators. Forex moves very small amounts in a day so usually the way people make money is by using leverage from their broker. TDAmeritrade will lend you  dollars for every  dollar you have if you qualify to trade forex. Meaning every  you have   in buying power. Lets say you have a good day in the Forex market and make . on a  trade you would profit  minus fees and commissions. There is obviously risk in doing this or everyone would be doing it. There is a long learn and curve and it is also possible to loose more money than you even started out with because you have to use leverage. ,Entrepreneur,d3h00yz,0,t5_2qldo

I have personally pushed aside dozens of ideas that I begin to develop when I sense the extent of resources needed exceed what I reasonably have time money and sometimes a specific skill.  The ideas dont need to die forever but there are better outcomes than having an ideatoobig collapse on you two years down the road due to very easy to see calculations from the beginning.  There is more to this than even execution because it is very difficult for a person to assess what the crowds will adopt  so thats the risk not just completion but both obsolescence over development time and also a possible ghost town at the end of the road.  Calculate your path based on all such possibilities.  I dont want to judge your idea but you would be competing against some hefty giants like Amazon Spotify and the long list to follow is brutal.

By evolved I mean I have the products ready to go just have not stepped into production runs.  These ideas could still benefit from another last leg of extra polish but that urge never dies  overall they sit decently well among competitor ideas today as is though with distributionrisk issues undoubtedly present.  Im the creative type have done sales can do graphic design for the internet.  Im always ALMOST THERE and Ive saved capital and can make a move but the need to make income keeps me rotating from one of these ideas to the next trying to decide If I should gamble on them or instead buy a cheap house without debt instead to ratchet down for a deeper more secured pull into the future with these ideas.  Funny thing is I already run a very small business but there is profit WHILE incurring costs.  Im on the edge with cost before profit and am uncomfortable putting more than a month or two in without money coming back in for those efforts  this comes from much personal experience with that problem!!!

It seems like its always physical products I dont remember ever seeing a software company on there. Thats a shame because the conversations are very different with software companies.

It can help but in the end if your company is at all successful your logo will be abstracted into an outline that people recognize. Oh its that thing. What is that thing? Your company. We know what that is.Soooo first stop trying to be too literal. Just try to find something that has an outline kind of different from other logos. Maybe three jars one vertical in the front and two peeking out from behind the two sides of it at  degree angles. Or since I presume its a daily jar ... in the mail? Try a postage stamp outline with a jar on it. Done. And makes a lovely little square icon of the sort that app developers so crave. Once you have an idea of the literal elements you want in your logo its harder for Fiverr to fake the effort its less likely that they have an existing logo template that is exactly what you described that they can slap your name and colors onto.In the end if its different enough from other stuff and kind of looks like the logo your kind of company should have dont sweat it.,Entrepreneur,d46bifc,1,t5_2qldo

Food business is more about creating an experience than just great food your branding your atmosphere your menu your company culture etc. must reflect this experience. A friend of mine has a catering consultancy based in London and they often advise investors like yourself from concept stage to launch they have strong industry connections with chefs interior designers marketers branding experts so youd definitely be wise to talk with a consultancy.

8293008,0,t1_d5e66cx,That makes things a lot more difficult. Without any interaction with the chief decision makers you cant have them jump ships. In terms of tutors cutting you out that is something that you cannot control. I recommend setting up a website like you said however at the bottom include a disclaimer saying that our tutors will NEVER ask you to pay in person. That way the parent can immediately detect a red flag and call you asking whether or not they need to pay. After you fire that tutor on the spot.Downsides include competition finding a constant supply of students as well as finding a constant supply of tutors to fill demand. With my years of experience in startup businesses contributing money is the easiest part. Anyone can throw money at a business and wish it into fruition however not many people can also put hours into the business to make it a reality.  Yes to the sliding scale however slide back the number of hours quite substantially. Say a person tutors  days a week for an hour each day. In less than a month theyre earning a  pay raise. Thats absolutely insane. Either lower the pay raise to a dollar every  hours or a five dollar pay raise every  hours. Thats just my cents I dont know the turnover rate for tutors so adjust the slide scale as you see fit.,Entrepreneur,d5e6ohv,2,t5_2qldo

8300614,0,t3_4t688g,Selecting plasmids is what a researcher would spend the next few months on.Id suggest an entrepreneur would focus on the following tricky tasks .... Finding a mentor that has taken something similar through FDA approval before or avoided the need for it. Build relationships with people who can act as the Chief Medical Officer for your company on an equity basis. Get involved in a community of people who are doing similar things in biotech. Here in San Diego we had a biotech track during startup week which would have been perfect for you   . For example Kent Pryor gave an excellent talk on running a virtualized biotech with only  full time employees still burning through millions of dollars of funding as youd expect.. Investigate qualified investors that could give angel funding. This is a different field to the normal Silicon Valley Im making an app to do xyz. Often there are wealthy investors who focus their investments in a specific medical area because of some historical tie to it. They are not looking to get rich  they want to avoid people having to go through what they or their loved ones did. You need to find them. You are going to need millions of dollars and  if you are smart you will get it. Crowdfunding does not work well for this kind of research.Finally dont worry about  years. In all likelihood if you create something worthwhile youll end up exiting before you go into manufacturing. Its just easier to turn it over to the companies that have experience and GMP systems for manufacturing as well as a big marketing budget. There is little value you can add here. It also frees rich you up to work on your cool next idea.Best of luck  it sounds very exciting.,Entrepreneur,d5f4uum,2,t5_2qldo

8441504,0,t1_d5un3f6,Just to clarify I slightly misspoke on my previous comment. I didnt actually own the laundromat myself. My dad owned it but I was primary in charge of running since my dad had other more important businesses.My experience was a positive one. We bought an existing laundromat that we felt had a lot of potential for growth. It was in a neighborhood with many apartment complexes that didnt have built in washerdryer. We fixed up the interior and put in new machines. We saw a steady increase costumers. What made our business take off was when we implemented laundry services. I noticed we had many oldersenior residents in the area. We offered a service of doing their laundry for them on a per pound basis. That resulted in a big spike in revenue for us. Additionally I made deals with local motels and did laundry for their sheets etc. since we had bigger machines than they had at their location.As far as operation it was a pretty hands off business once we had everything in place. We hired workers to do the laundry and hired a janitor to keep the business clean. I installed security cameras that I used to check up on the business throughout the day. As one point I was only going to the laundromat twice a week to take out the coins from the machines.I would recommend buying a laundromat but its important to do your research and consider the growth potential and all cost electricity water bills etc.. Eventually we sold the laundromat but it was profitable and overall low stress business. ,Entrepreneur,d5wq6d9,1,t5_2qldo

8461204,0,t3_4vkcw1,So this is an example from my own sphere of interest. Lilly Pulitzer is a preppy clothing brand who sell brightly coloured patterned clothes. There are also Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores which sell amongst other stuff the exact same clothes as the actual LP stores. They both sell online but a lot of the signature stores ship overseas whereas the LP store only ships in the US Its definitely possible there are a hell of a lot of these signature stores about and theyve been around for years so it cant be a dead end. Personally I think its probably down to  things. One  marketing. They do a decent amount of giveaways and sponsoring bloggersvloggers. Two  Unique Selling Point. In this case its the overseas shipping. Three  stocking similar brands. Its easier to buy a bracelet and a dress at one store than it is at two separate ones.Hope this kinda helps ,Entrepreneur,d5z6pvf,1,t5_2qldo
8464451,0,t1_d5z9cst,I might be new to Reddit but like other discussion forums people say things without checking the facts. Direct Mail PRINT MARKETING is as strong as ever if not stronger.  Do search and note the paid results and you will see a plethora of printers competing to do print jobs for direct mail campaigns.  Do a search on EDDM as well.  I also notice junk mail keeps keeps arriving in my PO Box  so print not dead at all.  Electronic marketing is part of your mix no doubt.  All flyers like direct mail pieces are not created equal.  An . x  inch flyer made out of copy paper very likely to be littering the campus.  There is a science to distributing amp creating hand outs part of that is speed of dispersion.  mamandkumquat makes assumption and ignorant one at that assuming all handouts are made the same.  They are not. Handouts typically are not sequentially numbered and do not have a web based input interface to measure the responses.  Now we do.  So let me cut to the chase. Let us do a real world test where I will print you  promo cards and we will measure the results and post them here.  We need to do text only chat on skype or get on the phone so I can customize promo card for your audience. I will do this en grata.  ,Entrepreneur,d5zld5u,1,t5_2qldo

8515595,0,t3_4wbdcz,Great post! I used to work as a search engine evaluator and I wanted to add a few things that arent mainstream tips but can make a difference.First if youre selling something make sure you have a contact page with real contact information. One of the tasks I performed was looking at web stores and determining if they looked legitimate. If no contact information was found and very little information was found about the website online hint get verified on Reseller Ratings and related websites as soon as they allow you to it was docked in the ratings. This is especially true if the website was recently created and has private Whois info. Its fine to care about your privacy but make sure you have that contact page. It provides vital legitimacy for your business.Second if you have a blog write for people first. Provide useful content and dont waste the rest of your page on ads for your stuff. You want the vast majority of your web page to be main content that is useful to the reader. Then you want some supplementary content that provides additional information. Supplementary content is primarily links to additional content and also includes navigation links. And then you can have small amounts of advertising.Finally optimize your website so it loads quickly especially on mobile devices. If your website takes several seconds to load not only are you going to lose customers who get frustrated and click the back button but Google and other search engines may lower your search engine ranking.  Google has been using speed as a factor in search engine ranking since  and Im sure they have only increased the impact since then.,Entrepreneur,d660b9e,5,t5_2qldo

Go on Twitter and find people who are in your area. Make sure your Twitter account has info about your icecream shop on it and a list of all the flavors. Twitter search is super powerful. Find people in your area like their tweets follow them or even tweet to them hey check out our shop while youre in the area!  You wont believe the results youll get. Social media is becoming the  method of marketing... For literally anything. I could sell nails on Twitter to construction workers. If you can convince that your nails are better than the others in one tweet you win.,Entrepreneur,d6m7kd7,2,t5_2qldo

If you want to tackle packaging inhouse then Ill share some tips that helped my neighbor doing the same thing.  Either stick or small jars should do the trick you can find affordable packaging here.   You can find shrink wrapping for sticks here.   Stick offers portability yet with my neighbors experience she didnt feel they sold well alone.  Small jars give a special handcrafted touch which a lot of your customers will love.  Maybe offering both stick and small jars would be beneficial.  In regards to labeling design and branding find a competent designer that has experience in the cosmetics industry that can source good stock for labels.  Some questions to ask yourself is if you want to convey a feel of hand crafted good Id go for a paper stock. Be careful with paper stock as the balm will stain it and it will become messy looking.  If you want for a clean look that stains less go for a high gloss UV coated label. You can purchase a label printer and do it yourself or find a printer that can do short runs of labels that are affordable.  Feel free to bounce ideas around I will be able to help more if needed.Edit I would also note to consider adding coconut oil to stabilize the product my neighbor had issues with  bees wax balm.,Entrepreneur,d6pw0rm,3,t5_2qldo

Basically it sounds like you need to come up with a name that feels like the name of your store and then people who are looking for your type of product will stop by your shop. If your shop is online SEO will be your best friend. If your shop is in person ie. markets keep an ear out for what customers are saying about your shop its products etc. So in your case you need to come up with Enter Store Name Here a new age home decor shop. Not everyone starts off with the name of their shop though when starting a business. So if you cant think of a name yet start creating your inventory and maybe a name will come to you.

Thats the whole point. If he was really passionate about technology would he have gone to India? Nope!

8857341,0,t3_51hw34,gt what do you first do when you have an idea?For me anyway when an idea comes to me Ill try to develop that in my head and go as far as my imagination takes me. This may take a few days or weeks. If I think the idea is promising I do mindmapping sketches to have a better overview of the whole thing so that I dont lose sight of the primary goal of the idea. I then research to see how that idea was implemented  because lets face it theres a good chance someone out there have thought of it already. I see how they implemented it what made them fail what made them succeed and so forth. Probably the most important part of this process is to see whether theres a market for the idea  the last thing youd want is to spend years building something that no one wants. So try to get customersusers solve the problem manually if possible. If it works if you can get people on board to buytrytestcheckout then you might have something on your hands..gt Where do you go to research?Mostly online forums and places of discussion are useful avenues. Its faster and saves me a lot of time. If the idea cant be learned digitally then you learn as much as you can online and then I imagine youll have to get your hands dirty by trying it out yourself..gt How do you determine the steps to take to get off the ground?Step  Find peoplecustomers. If you cant find anyone interested youre dead in the water. So talk about it on discussion forums. Make a landing page and see how many emails you can collect..Step  Assuming you have people interested in what you have to offer the next step is to provide an MVP. If its an online service of some sort you build something minimal and get some part of it automated. If its a physical product a very very basic shop will work. Continue acquiring peoplecustomers..Step  If things are looking up you can slowly start to add in features offer more products increase your social media presence and so on..After that is up to you..gt Where do you begin a website a name market research etc.?You can begin by finding customerspeople. Absolutely determine whether theres actual need and actual people wanting to pay for you it. Start there and do the rest after.,Entrepreneur,d7cizsq,1,t5_2qldo
8860854,0,t3_51ko58,Ozy please see this post from below from yanvis he had an excellent point that I failed to detail for you.Hi yanivs I completely agree with you on this... Let me explain my position and anyone here can feel free to ask away anything they want. I am a Pilot Manager with New Avon LLC. Many people know the brand Avon. However not many know that the company was purchased in October last year by Cerberus out of New York. New Avon is now privately held and run in the U.S. Canada amp PR. Cerberus is investing  Billion into rebranding the business and making it user friendly to the younger market that the dinosaur way of working the business failed to do over the last  generations. So in short the goal is to find out what young and modern entrepreneurs want and can achieve from this business model to be the most benefit. The Current Model will not apply to the Pilot participants Period. The long term goal is too make this the best option for someone wanting to start a business with no out of pocket expenses nothing to buy ever and ideally a modern approach of using Todays social media tools and ecommerce as the method of generating sales. I hope this helps a little for everyone that may have doubts. I agree with your comment as there are definitely some major schemes out there. Thank you for pointing this out yanivs I should have been more detailed. Hans,Entrepreneur,d7cy75g,-4,t5_2qldo

Sorry to break it to you but getting your game discovered on an app store is insanely difficult unless you catch lightning in a bottle or have a crap ton of money. All the apps you see in the top grossing lists have paid countless millions to acquire their users. Do a google search for mobile user acquisition to find an infinite number of companies you can pay to have users sent your way. Its not cheap. Were talking multiple dollars for each quality user.ampnbspAssuming you dont have a mountain of cash to spend your best bet is to do whatever you can to get featured. Thats really the only organic way of getting users short of getting an influencer to mention you on social media. see words with friends To get featured you need to be lucky andor incredibly persistent. You basically need to sell your game to applegoogle and convince them its worth featuring. Having existing relationships here is very helpful. I think your issue will be that you claim the game is similar to other games. The app stores seek out uniqueoriginal stuff from indies to feature. Unless it has a unique hook you may not get far.ampnbspAssuming you dont have money and you dont get featured your only remaining option is to get the press to talk about you. Even this can be a challenge since the top sites get inundated with requests. Send them a copy and synopsis of your game. ideally with video and other art assets.  Then start posting everywhere you can think of yourself. Social media forums Starbucks. Whatever. Basically at this point youre doing gorilla marketing and you can get a small trickle of users for as much effort as you are willing and able to put in.ampnbspAnother option to consider is going with a publisher. There are numerous companies out there that will publish your game in exchange for a good chunk of the revenue. Ultimately making any money by making a mobile game is ridiculously hard. There are probably  direct competitors to your game.

9031089,0,t1_d7wv3kx,You made my day! From your reaction I know youre gonna make it. Dont let yourself feel downtrodden. The world doesnt mean to do it. Sometimes to cope I have to treat it like a game with humor. When something goes wrong I react with Oh thats a new one! Even though I know it means as what happened last month I have no inventory no income. We have to stand up brush ourselves off and keep steeping forward with our vision. Baby steps yes. And for a long time it feels like youre not even pushing the boulder up with hill. Barely even keeping it in place. More like pushing with all of your effort to keep it from falling back and crushing you. A friend who invents and distributes products told me he pushed and pushed and pushed for years and then suddenly pushes came out of nowhere it seemed. The nowhere was all that effort I have horses I call it manurefrtilizer he had spread. That is just starting for me and omg is it sweet. And worth what it took.Have you read Choose Yourself? It came out when I was just starting my reinvention. I was so alone so scared. Failure to me was having to go get a real job. Part of me wanted to take the easy way out to be relieved from having to worry about my savings running out to have security. In his book James Altucher reminded me why that wasnt an option for me. It helped me be steely clear. Shut up those what if I fail demons chattering in my head. The title sounds corny but theres a reason its a classic Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill is another to turn and return to.

9033647,0,t1_d7xgmd9,I work at a startup where half the team is remote. The remote team does not hear the chatter we have going on in the office which sometimes leads to vision changes product adjustments changes in the tone of our marketing etc. And because sometimes these conversations just happen we forget to write them down or we dont fully translate what we discussed to the rest of the team. Its hard to keep a remote team onboard with changes to the company or product if theyre not around to see how the change came about.I think for a very new startup being in the same place is critical. Of course there are exceptions but from what I can tell those teams are few and far between.,Entrepreneur,d7xp9ar,1,t5_2qldo

A company that disrupted an industry couldnt replicate its innovation due to interesting hiring changes and the departure of its founder. Really cool read.

You were a little vague here but since Im from a lead gen background Im going to assume you mean target businesses and expanding a little further by region. Essentially this would mean that when someone puts in zip code  and fills out the form youd be directing the lead to any applicable business in Beverly Hills. . Theres a lot more to this than just a form. Its going to require a database as well. You need to store the groups right? All of this could be accomplished with PHPMySQLHTML. Im not going to tell you its deadsimple but you sound like you have drive and youre going to want those skills for step . . Twilio. This is exactly what you need. If you need a request to ping someones phone this is the service for that. Unfortunately its not going to be easy if you have zero coding experience however its also not incredibly difficult  you just need to know what you want and what youre doing. Thankfully Twilio has a ton of documentation and a tutorials section. Just a cursory Google and I found this repo on GitHub that gives you a script that that sends an SMS from form input using PHPMySQLHTML  Twilio. ,Entrepreneur,d7yfm4c,2,t5_2qldo

9163432,0,t1_d8digtp,Thank you.. I would say switch to computer science or better yet computerelectrical engineering if you can handle it. You can do the same job but Id wager are more likely to get hired. Plus its more funchallenging. That said to answer your question Ill try to list a very condensed version of what concepts you can try to research and learn on your own. Again mostly theoretical I rarely use this at work  on very specific occasions. Big O notation breadth first traversals dijkstras algorithm kruskals algorithm deterministic quick select mergeheap sorts fordfulkerson algorithm BSTs bubble sorts Discrete combinatorics graph theory probability. I may be forgetting some but these should be enough to essentially put you near or on par with CS majors.. As far as books for practical real world learning I really enjoy Oreilly books. They may not be the best but easy enough to follow along and teach yourself. Lots of stack overflownot a book. I really enjoyed going through Bjarne Stroustrops C book. Sipsers intro to theory of computation was amazing. . Quality not quantity. Pick something you want to work on could even be something to make your own life easier. Itll make the process more enjoyable and motivation will come naturally.. I was born in an interesting time. Not quite old but not quite young in my beliefs. Work hard and youll do it end of story. Go balls deep into that interview and show them you care and show them you want to learn. Thats all most people want. Some basic knowledge can help but ultimately a willingness to show up and kick some ass is what you need to succeed. Itll be hard it will suck and youll certainly feel like an idiot but get comfortable with being uncomfortable and youll be alright. I wont ever claim to be the smartest developer but Ill be damned if let that stop me from trying to be better. Part of what I enjoy about my field is theres so much to learn and thats what keeps it exciting for me.Im in South Florida where the tech market is questionable at times in terms of quality of businesstalent. We have Magic Leap here which is amazing I live about  minutes from those guys in Dania.

It can be a long and arduous process. Ive been helping my best friend build their Shopify store for the past two and a half years and only now are they making enough so they can quit their job and rely on it as their primary source of income. The first two months involved using facebook ad marketing Instagram some content marketing and other methods but nothing sold. By month three they got their first sale on Pinterest. So thats what they focused on. They grew their Pinterest to around  followers in a year. This resulted in around  sales per month and a gross profit of around . In year two they focused on growing their catalog number of pinterest followers capturing emails and tightening those two funnels optimizing the email sequence upselling crossselling promotions. By the end of year two they had  pinterest followers  email subscribers and were making around  sales per month. Gross profit was around . Only now are they really focusing on diversifying their marketing channels. I presume that they came from a similar spot as you. You did some Udemy course on Pinterest and they went into FB Ads? I would try to focus on building a reputable brand on experimenting with different channels Especially lowhanging fruit like Instagram and Pinterest and if you are consistent you will succeed. Most people will do these courses something wont work as well as on the course i.e. no sales for a month and theyll give up. Keep at it! My friend is on the trajectory of making k a month within a few years because they were consistent As in following  new pinterest people per day.  ,Entrepreneur,d8h9qzp,2,t5_2qldo

One of the nonprofits Im on the board of received funds some  over budget this year AND got a large legacy fund windfall. The catch is we cant go raising everyones salaries and throw a party with the money like you could with a for profit.A founder CAN make a living off of their position I f they are also executive director or CEO.  Keep in mind that your board becomes your boss and can remove you at any time.That said if youre just starting a nonprofit its not a good idea to immediately rely on it as a source of income unless you are either working another job have a pension or are independently wealthy. It could take you years to build up a reliable income stream for the organization.Not only do you have to treat this as a real business which it is but most nonprofits dont work on a product or service based revenue model.

I mean if I were the shop owner all it would really take is going on Amazon ordering a few tablets. Then when they arrive essentially paying someone  dollars an hour to set up the  machines and download Hearthstone. I dont imagine planning this tournament would be too much different than any other. So wheres the real benefit other than saving a few buckshours on initial setup of devices?c I see your point. The value of what your offering will probably be in that they wouldnt really risk muchup front cost and only pony up  of profits for just simply setting aside some time in their shop. But again whats to stop them from doing it for themselves AFTER you show them how profitable it may be?I like your idea I really do but I see a lot of flaws with it personally.

9402203,0,t1_d97ro65,Honestly the best way to start is to google it and start reading. I am not an expert in this area I am more tech startupy so I would recommend finding someone who has been successful at building blogs and reading their posts here on this subreddit and whatever else you can find on google.You can advertise but for a blog this is less than ideal because audiences to blogs are generally to read so you have an additional step to monetisation.IE a normal online shop just has the following Convince audience to spend money. The audience wouldnt browse to a shop in the first place if they werent already interested in potentially spending some money.A blog on the other hand is generally informational so it has an additional step to get revenue Convince audience to read blog  Convince audience to spend money.This ultimately is why I felt like a dropshipping storefront might be easier to handle. You can open a shopify account trial stick stuff up there from aliexpress or make your own t shirts or whatever and be running in  hours using ads to promote your site and see how it goes. Whereas I dont think ads would convert well enough to get a positive return on your investment for a blog. Not in the shortterm anyway.Having said that if you can build an engaged and returning audience for a blog then that will more likely be better in the longrun and more valuable if you ever wanted to sell it.,Entrepreneur,d97snmp,2,t5_2qldo

I also wanted to place another wholesale order and double check my business financials for the continued ramp up over the next two months.Then for my mastermind partnership I was working on tying into different APIs to create lists for our followers and wanted to do some general web dev work. Even though this is the shortest description my programming role with this partnership is probably the most challenging and stressful.Aside from a day job and two side gigs I also have three kids and am in the National Guard. At this point it is pretty much if I am awake I am working. But one thing I NEVER do is stay up until am. Well... except for guard weekends since I am usually at the bar until then but Ill get to that. Someone else mentioned to make sure to get sleep and I couldnt agree with that more. I can and have operated for long periods of time on minimal nightly sleep of  hours. But I can operate a lot better and get things done a lot faster when I am actually rested so I make sure to sleep at least   hours per night. The businesses can wait and cutting your time short forces you to prioritize what you work on even if it is unintentional. For example when you think shit I didnt get xy or z done I need to work on y right now it is obviously the most important task. I also focus on the things I am supposed to be working on when I am supposed to be working on them. I do not work on my side hustles at work and I rarely work on my day job at home. I did position myself in a way that my day job and side gigs benefit from each other and are all related but I wouldnt expect everyone to be able to do the same. The last thing I do is take breaks well at least I try to. Typically I will say that I am not doing any work on Sundays but get so bored of video games after an hour that I end up working anyways. When drill weekend comes around that is what I am focused on and know that this is the best time to give up sleep. So I grab my wife and hit the bars with my buddies. tldr  . prioritize your work and automate what you can . make sure you sleep . focus on the task at hand . take breaks,Entrepreneur,d9dwfh2,2,t5_2qldo

She told me she would take two professional looking photos that I would have full rights to use where I want plus she would also post a picture of her drinking the tea with a unique message of her own. Its important to craft a professional message and show the hiring person how you would benefit them. She was also willing to negotiate with me a bit on price. ,Entrepreneur,d9fj6j2,1,t5_2qldo
9463296,0,t1_d9fivbn,Thanks! First of all it depends where you live. Youll be able to charge higher rates in big cities like NYC LA Chicago etc. In my experience in smaller cities like Albany or Rochester NY rates are quite a bit lower usually around hr for a contracted tutor. Obviously the companies are charging a bit more often up to hr.If you live in a small city you might want to get into Skype tutoring. There are a few startups who are killing it in the online tutoring market though I admittedly dont have much experience there.In general I would recommend starting out by getting teaching experience. Either work as a TA help your classmates with their homework if youre still in school or work as a contracted tutor. Once you get experience you can take private clients and set your own rates. The best clients are often the ones who want yearround sessions rather than the ones who only need help preparing for a test.Good luck!,Entrepreneur,d9fjfdt,2,t5_2qldo

Youre going to have to learn how to research on your own to make it anywhere if youre interested in entrepreneurship. That being said landing pages are where your potential customers LAND. That is to say when you direct people using ads or social media methods the first thing they see is your landing page. That means this page is going to be a bit different than a normal web page. Its sole purpose is to turn potential customers into customers. It should communicate what your service or product is and why they need it enough to give you money for it. The number of potential customers that turn into customers and actually purchase something from you determines your conversion rate. If  customers visit your landing page and one of them buys something youve converted  potential customer gt  customer. Your conversion rate would be  because  of the people who saw your landing page and found out about your business actually saw the value in your productservice and decided to give you money for it. You can raise this conversion rate in a ton of ways so thats something you can research next. It can be as simple as different colors and layouts on your landing page that raise your conversion rates or as complex as restructuring your ad campaign or social media posts to make sure that people who go to your landing page are people who have a high chance of buying your product. You do this by targeting which just means getting your message to people who need your product. If youre selling life insurance you most likely shouldnt be serving your ads to teenagers right? Just like you shouldnt try selling the next big sneaker to an elderly person. ,Entrepreneur,d9fyl60,4,t5_2qldo

9485757,0,t3_5altqx,Like everything in life it depends.What youre looking for is often called a Minimum Viable Product or MVP. The idea is to build just enough of an app to validate your idea and see how the market reacts to it.You want to build it properly because if things go well you wont have time to start over from scratch you should be upgrading the MVP directly.There is generally  ways to go about building software termed the Waterfall method and the Agile method.In Waterfall you define all the features upfront and then hire a freelancerfirm to build it for a predetermined price. The downside to this method is that as the app gets built and you get ideas for new features its difficult to get these ideas into the app as the course has already been set and its difficult to figure out how to charge and what features to give up. The upside to Waterfall is that it minimizes the risk of going over budget. Although if you get a bad developer there is a risk the project doesnt get completed in the timebudget allottedIn Agile you hire a freelancerfirm for  sprint at a time. A sprint is usually a  week period of development where you set certain priorities for that period. The developer will help you scope out a reasonable goal for that sprint. At the end of the sprint you have a new brainstorming session and choose the scope for the next sprint. The downside to Agile is that the budget is a bit less defined upfront so you need to be flexible on that front but the upside is that the process allows for brainstorming and idea discovery middevelopment and when done properly development can stop after any given sprint.For most projects I vastly prefer Agile. It allows you to sort priorities and change course as you learn more about your app. It also forces the developer to be more accountable as there are frequent checkpoints where the software must be in a complete and ready to use state. I have seen so many Waterfall projects go late and over budget its astounding. While Agile doesnt prevent you from hiring a dud youll have a good opportunity to fire them after the first sprint if they arent living up to your expectations.Now for budgets it depends greatly on what you want to do. The going rate for an app freelancer is  USD per hour and the total cost depends on how much of the design the developer is doing or whether you are providing highly detailed plans and screens to build off of. A website is much cheaper to build than an app and building a cross platform app is cheaper than building separate iPhone and Android apps. Then the actual content of the app changes the price too. Financial transactions or medical histories are sensitive information and need to be handled more carefully than selfdeleting photos.All that to say is that the average project budget spans between  and . A huge range but it depends on what you need.As for finding people upwork.com can be good. Expect to get about  replies to any offer you put up and to have to sort through a lot of bad developers. Generally you want someone with a strong mastery of English and who lives in a westernized culture. You should also have a Skype date to discuss the project and see if they ask smart questions.You could also hire me  Im a freelance developer from Canada with an engineering degree and Im looking to take on new clients!

9489949,0,t3_5apatx,Hi thereGreat app! Think the design could be worked on a little bit to make it look a little more professional. In regards to monetisation you could get local employers on board and encourage students to export their grades to them and if the employer takes that student on you can charge X for the arrangement. Secondly you can sell experts in each course basically nerds who are willing to tutor people to maximise their grades. You take  of each hour of the fee arranged. You can sell complimentary books for each paper or get nerds to write study guides and give them  of each book sale. You can create online resources for each paper and charge  a month to subscribe to the app whereby the online resources are a study aid. This will require more content creation on your behalf but when you begin to leverage your networks and have the mindset of making everyone rich your business will grow. You could get people to challenge their classmates in the app to see who gets the best grade. Each person chucks in  and you take a  cut to organise the competition. Hope that helps.

So Ill ask another gettoknowyou question like what have you been up to lately? or what do you do with your time?  Read the audience but it takes the pressure off of making someone state their job title and having that define who they are. Since your gig is your passion and occupies most of your time right now then a logical answer if asked might be Ive just started a new business and it takes up all of my time but I love it.

The one thing off the top is that studying marketing in college will not at all directly train you to actually perform marketing functions in the real world. Its more conceptual its funny Im actually writing a blog series on this exact subject. I have  posts written but not ready to post yet. Academia will give you a deep understanding of consumer psychology and ad effectiveness. Anything you learn as far as actual marketing strategies you can throw out the window. Academia is always  years behind in this regard.

Just ask yourself what would happen if you had to make the same decision  times?Say you need to invest  and will either earn a million or lose it all.If you did this  times your total investment would come to  million. If youre successful just  times out of the hundred youd break even  times and youd come out a million ahead a measily  on  average so it all had better be quick and simple. If you think you have a  chance of success your average take would be  now. Sounds like a good deal if it only takes a year or two...Numbers arent going to be quite as straight forward of course and a main consideration has to be if you can afford a total loss of your investment and you have to weigh all that against a steady paycheck too.

Themes and layouts are easily tweaked. But I dont know how it is for blogging databases and portfolio style websites.

9798863,0,t1_dajrnfj,designs is great and they have a very compelling model. Ive thought about using them several times myself.Here are the downsides compared to working directly with a single artist. You dont control the quality. You dont get to pick which artists participate in your contest. You cant choose the one that matches the style you want ahead of time.. You cant give a design the space and time it needs to develop. I cannot overstate how important it is to let creative work breathe. For this you need a personal relationship with the artist lots of time and the patience to continually develop an idea. If you use the wham bam system of designs I dont doubt youll get something nice looking. But will it really resonate with you? Will it ever really feel like its yours? Itll look good but its impossible with their system to really put in the time while communicating on to create something truly great..

With dropshipping you will usually have  day shipping assuming it has ePacket to US and up to  days to other countries which is pretty bad. I wouldnt advise using dropshipping model if youre selling premium products because that wont work really well with clients that are interested in premium stuff. Ive been selling premium watches    and all of them expected up to  day shipping.

Being successful is all about knowing the right people at the right time. I guess what youre trying to achieve is to have a database of venues sorted by area allowing each venue to login and advertise the dates they have available for bands to apply for a gig. So as a first step without even building a website speak to as many venues as you can and collect up promoter names phone numbers and email addresses. Get as much feedback as you can on what THEY want and start local in your own area. Make it work for the venues in your hometown so you learn the mistakes before trying to launch it nationally.

10091919,1,t1_dbmntsl,gtHes in a financial niche market with high margins and high dollar volumes.I like how people like you come into these threads make wild accusations like Hes in XYZ niche market.No Im not. Sometimes I write for financial advirosries. Sometimes I write for health companies. Sometimes I write for brickandmortar dental clinics jewelry stores mattress retailers clothing retailers and more. Sometimes I write for informational products. I sell it all. I dont just write for any one market. I write for the markets Im the most interested in writing for at that time. For the last year thats been the financial niche. But just last quarter I wrote a sales page for a Real Estate coach after he got bilked out of almost  from a general marketing agency who thought creative slogans were going to get him clients and I did it for free. The only thing I required was  of the gross sales which meant I had to get results to get paid. I killed it with his campaign. I made him money where nobody else did and I did it in a fucking week with a single sales page and just three Facebook ads I wrote copy for. So please dont mislead people here by making assumptions. gtHis strategy may not work universally. His strategy certainly isnt the only one that works. Hes making bank and hes welcome to laugh while doing it. But methinks he takes himself too seriously.My strategy is the oldest triedandtrue method of marketing on this planet. It works globally. It works for literally every conceivable business on this planet. And I know that down to the last dollar because this form of marketing requires PROOF in order for people to make claims not GUESSING like every single general marketing firm out their builds their businesses on  false promises they cant prove and guessing to justify their lack of tangible results. gtThe best counterargument is that in some businesses landing pages and direct marketing letters arent needed. Again probably didnt read the entire post. Every single advertising method can be turned into direct response by simply requiring prospects to respond directly to the advertisement in order to take advantage of it. I have a prime example in the post as well. I can turn TV commercials radio direct mail email banner ads billboards print ads and fucking skywriting into direct response. And I will tell you how much money it made versus how much money it spent. What is the goal of advertising? TO MAKE SALESIf you cannot verifiably demonstrate that you are making sales as a direct result of any one advertising campaign then it is useless.What conceivable business out there desires to  use marketing for anything OTHER than to benefit their bottom line?What other forms of marketing out there are not promising to benefit the bottom line?What is the only possible way you can TELL whether or not any advertisement is benefiting the bottom line? By tracking it. What is the only possible way you can track sales in any channel? By requiring prospects to respond directly to an ad to take advantage of an offer. gtHe lost me at No business owner should ever... Pure click bait.Any business that spends money on advertising that is impossible to track is a business that is advertising blindly. That makes them either morons or duped by an agency. ,Entrepreneur,dbmzror,-1,t5_2qldo

When conventional wisdom is made up of cartoonish notions you can start with the thread Whats a piece of entrepreneur advice that you dont hear very often? But that isnt quite direct enough to reply to your post and stay on topic. If youve read a book and based your business on it that demonstrates a fine sense of real business. If youre taking complete ignorance of what is in that book and dressing it up with buzzwords from that book thats cartoonish. It also happens to be every MVP project I have laid eyes on. If you thought Gilmore Girls was inspirational enough to start a coffee shop please dont abandon the concept when contemplating business If your chosen industry ends in asaservice dont make the word service meaningless. If you want business advice dont look for an inspiring cartoon or circlejerk forum post in roastmystartup. If you plan to be considered as a real business know technology isnt magically going to make up for skill and strategy. Being on Facebook does not entitle you to be a social marketing expert. If your business is having difficulties dont bother asking which magic technology is going to just fix everything. If you want to be in real business do not ask remedial questions in forums clients for your business are going to be asking you for answers about. If you cant read a book dont bother trying the drive through for a quick answer that just demonstrates you dont know what the client is going to ask immediately after. ,Entrepreneur,dbtx9o2,3,t5_2qldo

Put yourself in your customers shoes and think about it from their perspective.As for the coding its tough to tell how fast fast is with technology. Some things that dont seem tough to a nontechnical person can be wildly difficult to implement. Id speed things along by asking him to put together a schedule and then periodically reconciling to that schedule understanding why variances happen and adjusting future schedules for what you learn.

10320944,0,t1_dcdfkfi,I had this challenge during my MBA program  years ago and we won it and actually created a solid business. We had  days and a sealed envelope that had an undetermined amount of money. Having been familiar with the Tina Seelig concepts that you have experience and knowledge you can sell right now at almost zero startup cost we went to work. I had just come from Wall Street and had learned how to really succeed in consultative sales. The other two werean architect and a guy who had been a digital marketing manager for a large tech company. So we decided to do a content and digitalmarketing firm and sell the services in our local market. The first night wepulled an allnighter put together the sales pitch deck put up a basic Squarespace site to make us look legit and within  hours of the start of the challenge we were working our networks to get leads. After the  days we had sold projects between kK ACV formed an LLCand we had actually birthed a functioning business. We ran the business through the rest of our MBA program and had built up about K MRR. Upon graduation the digital marketing guytook over as CEO and me Im on the board and the architect still are owners and get income from it even though were doing our own things sold my first startup on my second. The architect now works atSnapChat.We never actually opened the envelope and its framed in the CEOs office.I know cool story bro. But my point here is that starting a business can actually be really easy and not require a lot of resources. keeping it alive and growing is the hard part Most people have skills experience or knowledge that other people dont but value enough topay for. Most of the barriers that people run into are more mental than others.,Entrepreneur,dcdxp3n,13,t5_2qldo

10349410,0,t3_5o5jwk,I spent an hour or so working on a quick refresh of your site hit the following link to take a look link removedAs a few others have alluded to there are a few simple things you can change that will help improve your site leaps and bounds.First and foremost typography. Many designers fail to acknowledge the importance of good typography when infact the written content on your page is perhaps the most important content a user can engage with. There are a number of excellent typefaces available for free from Google Fonts. For your site I chose Montserrat  and Roboto  both of which are pretty standard sansserifs. From what Ive seen it seems as though youre going for an alternative aesthetic there are plenty of beautiful pairings you can make with Google fonts so if MontserratRoboto arent for you Id recommend checking out the following links for some inspiration  Second colour palette and imagery I used a standard shot from www.unsplash.com for the hero image you can find more than enough free to use stock imagery from here to fill out your site especially when youre offering something relatively generic like Digital Marketing services. Id recommend getting rid of the earthy tones anything purple  moss green  brown  yellow  beige especially when executed poorly tends to make things look less professional. I went with a simple BlueWhiteDark Grey palette which I think fits really nicely with your brand more on that next.Third branding. Its really important that your logo reflects something unique about your business whether its your name whether its the services you provide whether its your patented process there should be a pretty obvious visual connection between the name of your business and your brand. For Blue Edge I used a simple blue line to separate Blue Edge and Business Solutions this provides a really simple but super specific reference to your brand name. This motif is continued in the primary navigation the blue underline to show an active menu item.Fourth content. It makes no sense to hide your services behind a dropdown navigation element bring them to the front and centre show visitors what it is you can do for them. Speak in commonly used language dont be afraid to use emojis where appropriate show people why youre better than the competition even if that is something as simple as We speak in normal language were down to earth friendly people just like you.Just a few quick thoughts for you to consider! If youd like me to send you anyall of the files I used feel free to send me a PM and Ill send everything over by email.Hope this helped.,Entrepreneur,dch5yxv,2,t5_2qldo

However it doesnt fully reflect what you will actually do there is no hint of the fact that your platform will connect people with real estate agents. I would suggest you to think of a name like Bridge to the East or East Home Market I checked domains easthomemarket.com and bridgetotheeast.com are available. Actually I think its only you can come up with the name that really suits your business no contests or naming experts can do it for you. You can simply take the words that you like most e.g. Nest East Home and play with them in a real estate name generator Im sure you will find a name that you will love.,Entrepreneur,dchu8ir,2,t5_2qldo

Fighting your way to the top is possible but very difficult. When you finally get to the top there is nothing stopping Amazon from copying what you do and making all your work obsolete. Remember as long as you are doing business on Amazon they own you. To avoid this and to be in complete control of your margins you will have to set up your own site to sell. Now for this to succeed you will have to spend money to make your website and to market this website Say hello to risk. Going to these lengths you still have the problem that your supplier is taking a large percentage of the profits from products you sell there is a limit in the designs you can sell and there is most likely hundredsthousands of people selling the exact same thing. There is nothing wrong with this considering they manage inventory manufacturing and shipping for you but it isnt exactly scalable. You will eventually feel as though you need to free yourself from this so in the end you my as well buy in bulk design your own products brand and control everything you do. Enter even more riskIf you dont have the money I suggest you just find a niche create a website find a supplier and make sales through the site by utilizing organic marketing reinvesting profits and growing your brand to the sky. but then you will also have the problem of  week shipping ,Entrepreneur,dcjal82,1,t5_2qldo

Especially if you are remote!     If anyone is interested check out rfinancialindependence  cutting  from your monthly expenses in many ways feels the same as earning like  more per month!

That being said I would argue that if your average member of the public can get the gist of your message then you created a pretty effective presentation. Heres some initial ideas for questions my family members and myself might ask.So youve created another Gmail thats more secure? Wait I have to have an actual piece of hardware that my stuff is plugged into? Is this like another router thing? How much storage space will I have access to? My current gmail isnt encrypted now? I can send terabytes of files instantaneously? That cant be right... I can control the files even after the other person has downloaded them? Can I still use Gmail or do I have to use new sndr whatever email? If not then is this just an addon? Why would I need the box if everything is in the cloud? Do I really need to have a new box to setup? Those are some hard concepts to explain to your average Joe. I like the sound of quickly sending massive files but that entire description pinged my skepticism radar a bit. Instantaneously? Terabytes? Whos paying for that storage? Will this be one upfront cost or a monthly service charge? Encryption is nice and all but thats not the highest of my priorities. Im not Jennifer Lawrence with nude pics of myself on the phone.

Op can market it as a designer all he wants. Im not saying its gonna work hence the reason most brands choose not to approach it from that angle but he is aloud to. Parading around the comment section saying the op is lieing is only spreading more lies and sticking to your point that has been proven wrong is only showing ignorance. Your Chevy example is irrelevant. If Chevy came out with and xyz model and marketed it towards the middle class as a luxury car they are by definition selling a luxury car. To someone in the middle class it IS luxury. Upper class people driving a Porsche will call BS on Chevy and scoff only because they can afford to. The millionaires driving a Ferrari are going to call BS on the Porsche drivers because when you can afford a Ferrari a Porsche is no longer a luxury car to them. The real kicker is that most Ferraris dont have power seats or a decent stereo and you have to rebuild a k clutch every th time you use the auto launch.ITS ALL MARKETING.

Im on the last chapter of the book currently and enjoying it so far.Firstly while some of the information Ferriss presents is slightly outdated most of it is timeless really actionable and useful today. For example he has an entire section of the book dedicated to eliminating the extra shit you do daytoday that wastes your time. Ive implemented a ton of the advice he gives and Ive seen pretty good results. Secondly I think the whole idea of the book is about creating a mindset where you value the time you have while you have it and the enjoyment you get in that time over the money you earn. Its a really uplifting read in that sense.There are aspects of the book I dont like but overall I really enjoyed it.

You might already be profitable for all I know  I dont know if you even know.Look I actually do vape  and I can tell you that  of the vape shops out there ABSOLUTELY SUCK at marketing.

Im never been sent an email asking me if I need new coils or other disposable type materials. If I buy a  pack of coils and theyre typically good for a week or so each  wouldnt it make sense to email me about  weeks out asking if I could use more? The same goes for eliquid etc. If I were in your position Id focus on bringing in customers at a loss and then marketing to them once theyre in the door. Incentivize them to join your email list join push marketing campaigns and you should have a mailing address once theyve placed an order. If this is your primary business you should be thinking about how you can improve EVERY single day.

Without some well defined parameters for power there will be arguments. Ive always preferred being alone. I have multiple businesses now and recently married the girl Ive been with for over  years. Ive offered her positions in the companies but made it very clear that I have final say on anything. I have a cold and methodical approach to business and can categorize it separately from all other aspects of my life. She knows this decided she didnt want to be a part of it and refused. Business brings out a different side of people and often times it has to. If youre OK with that so be it otherwise youre in for a rude awakening. Im a totally different guy when its time to work than when Im just relaxing. I will be cold I will be harsh and I will be blunt. All because I dont have time to waste on sugar coating things or being nice. I also love every second of it because a part of me is that way and needs that outlet. Obviously my experiences are anecdotal but they may be something to consider. It also depends on what you want from your business.

10856165,0,t3_5v6x85,In my experience when it comes to Instagram its quality over quantity. When doing your followinglikingcommenting strategies make sure youre engaging with people who are highly likely to buy your product  not just spamming to get eyeballs. The targeting needs to be on point. So research a LOT into where your previous customers hang out. And then start churning out high quality comments on similar peoples photos sometimes including your productservice in them but you have to stay away from being too direct  this is where I personally see high conversions coming from. It also doesnt hurt to step up your photography game. Instagram is very visual. People dont just go to your profile and click the link  they look through your feed. If its only full of uncreative white background product photos theyll just nope the fuck out. Make your Instagram tell a story make your product part of a lifestyle they want to have. This gets them ready to buy before they even hit your website. ,Entrepreneur,ddzqj7x,1,t5_2qldo
10856959,0,t3_5v7aaw,Question I got via PMDo you believe that there is still a market for drop shipping? Im not just the average person who puts In  minutes of work and expects something to do. I am currently working on a millennial ambition blog and would love to also build a dropshipping business at the same time. Im in it for the long game. I want to build a viable business.Absolutely!The act of dropshipping is simply buying your products from a supplier and allowing them to take care of the shipping which is similar to what huge companies such as Walmart and Amazon do regarding their fulfillment. There will always be a market for cheap products online that you cant get in the store and viral products such as a sushi roller that look very good and interesting in video ads and infomercials.The longterm game is to find a niche that your dropshipping is working well in and simply slap your brand name on it so that you can relate to your audience and build up trust in the customers eyes. Dropshipping is excellent for testing products and building up that quick capital that you can roll into your long term brand real Estate or a completely unrelated startup.,Entrepreneur,ddzthfv,0,t5_2qldo

I have a few bar owners who I will be meeting up with to discuss things and see what advice they have to offer but my thoughts are twofold. One Id like to have a bit down on paper as a start before meeting with them because I figure the more I have the more seriously they will take me. Seeing as I will be potential competition I dont know how much they will or will not be willing to divulge. And two my network is drastically smaller than this very large group of entrepreneurs.

Seriously. You hear about the rare occasions that it happens like Facebook although the situation there was a lot murkier than it seems but the odds of it happening are pretty low. When you hire a developer they dont want your idea. Usually they dont want shares in your company either. They want cash. Make them sign a doc if you want.What you should be worrying about is successfully developing your software. When an IT startup fails its usually not because someone stole their idea. Its because they didnt successfully execute the development process.,Entrepreneur,dea139z,1,t5_2qldo

10958398,0,t1_dea35hp,Congrats on getting started with your journey! In terms of website platforms I always vote for Wordpress. It has some great templates and you can pretty much customize as much as youd like to. Its great for people with little knowledge but is also powerful for those with great experience. So in terms of your specific idea. I wonder if you really need a website to begin? It sounds like you truly are at the beginning stage of things. You have an idea you dont quite have a business. You may want to make sure you validate your idea before creating a website and sourcing products and such. You might not even need an official website as you get started. Perhaps a Facebook page would be good enough to start getting orders? The first few steps should be to talk to people to determine the need for your specific service. You can also figure out the proper messaging you want to use for your target demographic. I could say much more on this and would be happy to share more detail if you wish. I guess my main advice right now would be to not be too concerned about a website and marketing at this stage in your idea validation. Good luck!,Entrepreneur,deaa4gy,2,t5_2qldo

10974675,0,t3_5wlmi5,Im really impressed that this is your first VSL.I think you might want to add a pattern interrupt at the beginning to grab attention. For example you mentioned a financial toothbrush. You could say like This is a toothbrush. Did you know this could be the key to building up your dental practice? Ill tell you how in a minute. And have a photo of a toothbrush on the slide. Then hopefully you hook the viewer so they watch until they figure out why a damn toothbrush is so important.Basically throw in something weird and unusual to get the viewer to break their usual pattern of behavior and grab their attention. Create a question that the viewer will want to get an answer to. You do need to have a payoff later in the video that ties it together and explains things.Its clear youve done your research the statistic at the beginning about how so many dentists cannot retire is definitely a what keeps you up at night? problem. Id suggest really blowing up this problem and vividly depict the worstcase scenario. Like a dentist whos faithfully served his community for  years but retired broke due to changes in the market changes to health care policy insurance companies that screwed him over on payments etc.  Really magnify the pain so they seek a solutionwhich is your offer.You also used a series of yes set questions to build agreement at the  minute mark. Get the prospect to nod their head and say Yes! and you get closer to the sale. Good stuff!At  you disqualified the competing options that they might be considering. This is really good. Your prospect might think But I can just get financial advice from my CPA my attorney etc. But you overcome that objection.Id include more insider language. Words and phrases that call out to your target market. Are there things that dentists say to each other that you could include in your VSL? It shows you really understand them and get them. You already do a good job of saying you specialize in serving dentists but think I think using some terminology might prove that more.For example financial advisors complain about plate lickers. These are people who go to sales presentations where the promoter offers a free steak in exchange for getting to deliver a pitch. These people dont care about learning about their finances they just want the free food and even lick the plate to get every morsel. If you could find slang like that and put it in your VSL it could improve results. Your VSL would be stronger if you included more stories. The dentist who couldnt retire the dentist whose accountant embezzled a fortune and fled the dentist who got bad advice from an attorney and lost everything a dentist who got in trouble with the IRS etc. People love to hear horror stories. But it also sets up the pitch because your offer will stop those things from happening.At  you share some success stories. They might be stronger if you tell them as before and after stories. Not just the success but how their finances were in shambles before you swooped in and saved the day. You could also go on with what those dentists did after you saved them. Like a dentist was able to pay for his parents to take a vacation to put a child through college things like that. Make the benefits more concrete. Appeal to things that dentists want to have. Id love for someone else to handle the bookkeeping so I could attend my sons baseball games!When you talk about your bonuses I think you should build up the value more not just say the titles. Maybe even pull out quick bullet points that tease what theyll learn in those bonus reports. Sometimes people will get a book just to learn what the secret was in one bullet point.gtThe  Biggest Financial Mistakes Dentists Makegt gt Youll discovergt gt  How dentists lose money by not saying this one simple phrase to patients.gt gt  What business policy makes their practice sell for half of what a dentist could have gotten.gt gt  The secret ways employees steal money from the dentists they work forand how to stop them.I didnt really get a sense for who you the narrator was. Who is Benjamin Brown? Was he a former dentist? Which means he know what its like? Or was he a financial advisor who saw dentists fail financially? In which case he becomes their advocate who fights on their behalf? Why is helping dentists in particular so important to him? Was his dad a dentist who went bankrupt? People buy you as much as they buy what you sell. Although customers know that businesses want to make money having a higher purpose can be very persuasive. This video breaks it down well Start with Why How Great Leaders Inspire Action | TED TalksOn the flip side I thought the VSL was missing an enemy. Every good story needs a villain. I think there was a big missed opportunity in not making the IRS more of the bad guy. The investment advice industry uses the IRS all the time in their sales materials. Everyone loves to hate them. If you had a case study of a client who got into trouble with the IRS and how you rescued them that would be powerful. Since youre talking about retirement I think you might want to hire a voiceover artist who sounds similar to your target customer.  Like if youre targeting male dentists over  find someone who fits that demographic to do your voiceover. Judging voices is subjective but my gut says that matching the voice of the VSL to the market will boost results. You sound a bit young and I think baby boomeraged dentists might subconsciously dismiss what you say because of that. What does this kid know?  I was pulling teeth out of patients when he was still sucking his thumb!For contrast heres a little video with narration by Will Lyman whose voice just radiates truth and gravityThe Retirement Gamble | Trailer | FRONTLINE | PBS Even if hes saying something ridiculousWill Lyman recorded my outgoing voicemail message  This is what I got him to say Fun fact Will Lyman also does the voiceover narration for those Dos Equis beer Most Interesting Man in the World commercials.Id splittest against a version of your VSL with no music. Just a hunch.Youll probably get criticism that your video is too long. Keep in mind that people can be willing to pay attentionwhen youre talking about them and their problems. No one complains about being too understood. The higher the price the more you have to overcome objections and skepticism and prove your value. Youre not going to get a  a month client with a second commercial. The End of America VSL by Stansberry Research is over an hour long and the company made a fortune from it. The point is to stay relevant and you can go on for longer than most people think. The EoA video is so relevant to its target customers fears that some people thought it was a documentary. The narrator didnt have the greatest voice either he was pretty monotone.To zoom out a bit I would say to find a big idea for your message. Like a more concrete image that captures the value proposition instantly. That gets the customer to sit up and think Yes I want that! You mentioned a st century dental practice. Thats a start but a bit fuzzy. When you later mentioned an outsourced CFO I think thats getting closer.  Im just brainstorming but maybe a ZeroAccounting Dental Practice is one idea. No one in your dental office has to look at a spreadsheet ever again! One of my favorite strategies is to find the most painful problem the client has and position your offer as giving them a dream business without that problem. The Paperless Legal Case The No ColdCalling Sales System you get the idea.Heres an article that might helpThe FourLetter Code to Selling Just About Anything What makes things cool?The book Made to Stick Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip Heath and Dan Heath is a great read on coming up with sticky ideas.Hope this helps.

Zero talent.As in Sure I can see that you went to college and werent dropped on your head as a baby but youre not a writer.There are a billion and one resources to help you improve  and even talented writers need to tuck their balls or ovaries between their legs and work on getting better...but if youre not at least moderately talented to begin with youre not going to put your nose to the grindstone and eventually be in a position to charge real money. ,Entrepreneur,dedlbtr,7,t5_2qldo

11106608,0,t3_5ykcs1,In the s tech startups lived by the following four principles Drag yourself kicking and screaming to success.  Plan? We dont need no stinking plan.  Monkeysee Monkeydo works best when you have a high opinion of yourself and your uniqueness.  Customers? We dont need no stinking customers. Or market tests. Or user testing. Or research. Im being a bit facetious. Reddit only needed one customer with more money than brains to pull off the builttoflip business model. Then the ambient stupidity of thinking users are automagically unmonetized customers kicks in. Thus starts the inevitable search for a switch marked Monetize to flip to the ON position. Pity Go Big Or Go Home never applies to generating revenue. Or any budget for anything. Ever. Ever wonder how with wall to wall zero price everything all the time and year after year pre dot com post dot com just charging full price never became an innovative twist? Making posts such as OPs awkward to say the least. Its hard to ignore everything about the Dotcom meltdown in a post to Reddit about lessons learned. And yet...Post Dotcom the words change ... the actions didnt. Today people have a plan Like Lean Startup  that they are not going to read about follow or pay the slightest attention to  just squawk emveepee like a brain damaged parrot. Resulting in MVP being the least you can possibly do plus whatever less you think you can get away with. This weeks magic incantation for the cargo cult business to say over anything it was going to do anyway. Ask Yourself these  QuestionsDoes Googling the competition  not customers  really produce much innovation? Will entrepreneurs constant drumbeat of dont think  just start yield a superior sense of market timing? Here. Hold my beer and lets find out. My niche is small business um ... thats a niche right? Answer NO. Dont Craigslist and Fiverr go together like peas and carrots? Can I rant about Yelp being mean to me here?Recession? ... Wut?

Get a cute panda drinking tea via Upwork or similar. Boom done.Main photos look like hell at that size and resolution. You need some help with this. Get a designer.Great tea delivered to you is not remotely enticing or special. This is one of your big problems right now. You need a better value proposition. Check out Peter Sandeen to figure out what your value prop is.While traveling Asia for many years I discovered the beauty of tea culture and the many health benefits of drinking different kinds of tea. I had no idea how to speak the local languages however I did not let that stop me from socializing with the locals. Many times I was invited to sit down and enjoy a cup of fine fresh local tea and make new friends. Lovely but I dont care and neither do your customers. They are asking Whats in it for me?. If the answer is a story about me and my adventures in tea they are gone. Change to what makes PBT special and unique in more detail i.e. expand on the value prop and the benefits of YOUR tea.Visit our Blog! Why would I do that? I want to learn about your tea and maybe buy some. Change this to something that you actually want people to do.Smaller photos  this section is ok but you need to describe the tea to entice people to click further and remove Herbal Tea since they are obviously all teas. Make it something like thisAngel Falls MistFrom the jungles of Peru comes this exotic and special mixture. Earthy tones meet tropical hints and touches of coconut for a refreshing unique tea.Join our communityWTAF is going on here? Reward points for sharing etc? No and the image is bizarre and offputing. Remove whole section.Blog posts  yep maybe but these are too generic. If you want to generate traffic with the blog find out what people are actually searching for. Id recommend reading Backlinko for tips on how to make your blog actually perform in terms of traffic gen. I would recommend doing a comprehensive guide to why people should drink XYZ tea for example. Heres an article on meditation that is ranked  for its keyword because its  benefits. Thats a serious comprehensive article. You should do something this detailed Instagram. Sorry its bad. You should be looking for aspiration tea drinking images from around the world and running those instead or maybe just tea in strange situations.

11220465,0,t3_605pxa,gt First came the KMarts and Wallmarts. With much greater purchasing and distribution power than the smaller national stores like Woolworth etc these giant supermarkets quickly became the best marketplace for consumers. The giant supermarkets didnt have a high profit margin usually in the low single digit. However the greater volume made up for it. Soon enough smaller chains as well as the local Mom amp Pop stores simply could not compete and went by the way side. These are competing in the exact same market with the exact same products. A bottle coke is the exact same no matter which store I buy at so itd be foolish of me to pay more than I have to  unless the more expensive product somehow manages to make up it for it  usually by being more convenient to get.If you look at designers the same way and dont care about the differences in the result you can likewise chose the cheapest supplier. But you wont be getting the same result will you?A designer who charges  can simply speaking put three times as much effort into your logo as someone charging . More iterations more communication more care being taken.Sure you might get lucky and get an arbitrage advantage by going offshore but at the end of the day youll pay for that through language barriers cultural differences and legal complications.

11247426,0,t3_60j3b5,Hey there  So I had a look at your website and I hope my two cents here can be helpful. A little background I am a wedding photographer and I believe we almost share the same clientele. ampnbspHeres my thoughts  The branding for now is ok. I would definitely invest more into a brand because this is what really seperates you and adds value to your products. I know it sounds shallow  but it works like that. We rebranded after counteless times trying to do it ourselves with professionals an investment and it literally changed the business for us in a good way. ampnbsp I think the idea is really interesting. I love the stone  rock material and believe that as its unique  it can work. What i am missing though is something a bit more realistic than just photos. Again I know that sounds funny  BUT if you could make some videos doesnt have to be professional but videos of the workmanship. Your hands holding it. The sound it makes when you place it on the table believe me you can tell a LOT about the quality of something just by the sound it makes when you put it somewhere. Imagine a plastic plate vs a ceramic plate... you see?.ampnbsp I am on a Mac and the smooth scrolling really isnt pleasant to use. Maybe on a PC its great but here personally its a bit cumbersome. ampnbsp On your about us  try add more pictures of you and your team. What will really reach the hearts of your clients is seeing a few faces behind the project. Tell stories about your team even interview them and share a blog. Everyone has a story. Use this on your FB and Im pretty sure this will reach some hearts. ampnbsp I am missing information on shipping the process of ordering and the like. Try and make it as easy as possible while still giving a lot of information. ampnbsp Lastly right now Im guessing you only have the  product in mind  but instead of listing it just by itself in a tiny square dedicate an entire page to it. Showcase the beauty of it. Photograph the details the workmanship the product in a home on display... all of that while giving all the information you need. Also specify sizes and such  ampnbspI hope this helps and i really dont want to come off as too strong  but I see potential in this and as someone who knew nothing about branding and stuff a year or so ago  i quickly learnt how effective it is and how UX plays a huge role in todays businesses. I sincerely wish you the utmost best of luck and if you have any questions  please dont hesitate to write or PM. Greetings!,Entrepreneur,df6vnkn,2,t5_2qldo

11349737,0,t3_61yrli,I have been actively working on growing my business for the past four years while still working fulltime. As of  the revenue of my business had reached  of my annual salary. Im at a point where I feel the business is stabilizing enough to really allow serious consideration of making the transition to being my fulltime employment. I still have more logistics to figure out paying myself and what not. Otherwise all the money from the business has been reinvested into the business while I still work. One of the hardest factors has been rebalancing for the unexpected. Since beginning my business Ive moved between major metropolitan regions purchased a home gotten married been in a semimajor car accident and been through five different vehicles. The time of transition is going to be factored a lot by your situation. When I started out I was living solo and single and really comfortable following my passion. I have a log going back as far as  from when I decided the corporate gig wasnt for me. It was a full year and a half from when it started of getting things in my personal situation in order enough. I still had a lot of credit card debt from college and part of that transition was getting myself in a better financial fitness to even consider saving to start my business. ,Entrepreneur,dfigzv1,3,t5_2qldo

11438672,0,t1_dfsja02,NDAs are most certainly a burden which is why most professionals do not sign them. Im glad that youve never been bitten by their ambiguity. And I hope that you never are.An NDA is an extra legal burden because as we both know a court case is not about the truth... its about what can and cannot be proven. And either way it costs money. An NDA should there be an attempt to enforce it requires me to prove without a doubt that any and all seemingly tangentially related concepts were created thought of or executed before I signed that NDA. Not to mention it puts the burden upon the court to even understand the extent of an overlap in areas they may exhibit no expertise in.So before you sign an NDA you better make damn sure anything youre doing right now or have done doesnt have any overlap with the idea about to be discussed. Oh and you better make damn sure that no one you talk to in the future has any overlap with the idea that has been previously discussed.Because as youll find going to court is about who has the biggest gun.

11526633,0,t1_dg2ftxm,Digital marketing is not difficult to get into. You simply do some learning either through Facebook blueprint or Google adwords help center and start trying to get clients.Getting good paying clients is where it becomes challenging. A lot of times I recommend working with a customer for free and just having them cover their software costs and add spend in exchange for a testimonial. I would also put a predetermined time frame or performance metric as a benchmark for when they would start paying you and you know longer do it for free.There isnt really one thing that is the bulk of your work if youre trying to do it yourself. You have to do sales and marketing for yourself you have to be able to do your own bookkeeping in invoicing you have to be able to do your own customer service and find a way to track communication in correspondence with customers and potential customers theres the aspect of doing market research and industry research for a new customer you have to create ads and then decide if youre creating the graphics and landing pages or outsourcing that to a contractor. Theres a few other things that youll bump into depending on what specifically youre doing but if you really want to be in the industry you just need to get in and start doing something. Too many entrepreneurs are paralyzed by trying to learn too much and no too much before they start taking action. If you were upfront and honest with people and tell them youre getting into the business youre just learning now and youd like to try some things to see if you could help them. Most people will agree to do free trial of your services for a period of time while they cover ad cost and software in exchange for testimonial.

11530735,0,t3_64ktni,I dont have any of the direct materials you asked for but my background is BB sales not exclusively SaaS but sales had the same core principles no matter the product. Humble brag Ive been a top performer for years and have invested a lot in my selfdevelopment to be a better salesperson. These thoughts Im going to share are coming from my personal experience and success and I hope you find value.Tip   In sales effort outperforms talentskill every single time. This isnt to say dont invest in training amp development or not to focus on hiring skilled and experienced salespersons its just that sales is all about how much effort you put in. Key Performance Indicators KPIs are important but the most important one is  revenue.Think of it this way you have two sales people. Salesperson A and Salesperson B. A closes  of opportunities. B closes  of opportunities. Do you want A or B on your team?Trick question you need more information to be specific how many opportunities does each one generate. If A generates  opportunities only  will be closed if B generates  opportunities  will be closed. You want B if those are the numbers.This in my opinion is what separates great sales leadersteams from mediocre ones. Salesperson A is appealing to have on your team that  close rate is often the result of a great personality and in depth product knowledge. They have the best phone and presentation skills. But if they dont work harder than Salesperson B B is going to be your top performer. I look at results topline who brought in the most money? Not who has the best story not who makes the best PowerPoint presentation or has the best elevator pitch. Salesperson B might be last in close rate and have the longest sales cycle but if theyre putting in the effort they will be making you the most money. What this means for you as a leader is to first focus on having a culture where everyone is focused on putting in effort. Effort is rewarded not intangibles like presentation skills. NOTE I was A for a long time until I had a manager that got me putting in B type effort and since then Ive been a top performer. But Ive seen more Bs improve their close rates than Ive seen As increase their effortTip   will be written in a few I have to go for now. ,Entrepreneur,dg30eh6,2,t5_2qldo

The simple way of saying theyre going to show your ad to fewer and fewer people because they feel they have a better idea of who is going to convert the best. One way around this is to significantly reduce spend to the ad and duplicate it to start over.

Even if you have a patent in China...enforcing it is the issues. The real question you should be asking is if you want China to be a market of yours. No matter if you produce in China or not if you become a successful brand in the US there will be copycats in China. Even from just a photo they can reproduce your product in less than  days and bring it to market. How you win in China is being known for the one who developed the product. China values brands. Also dont underestimate the buying power of the rising middle and upper class in China. They trust Chinese less than we do. They also value authenticity not fakes. Each time I return to the US my friends ask me to buy Longines watches or Coach bags because they know theyre real. They also think theyre cheap in the US.If you socially market well China can be a beautiful market for you. Chinas mobile connected consumer market is completely different from what we would expect. WeChat and Alipay make it super easy for consumers to buy online and they do! On Chinas Singles Day Alipay processed US.B  of those payments were made through mobile.Also US. is too cheap for Chinese to think your product is of good quality especially for an American brand.

You can always start another business when you have a better footing down the line.Aside from the deadweight partner and cash flow issues there are a few questions You said you have a website. How are you planning to get it in front of customers? Do you already have leads who are willing to buy from you or will you need to spend time and money to generate them? Where is your inventory stored right now and what is it costing you? Will your inventory become obsolete with time and if so how quickly? Are you able to find cheaper shipping methods?Every one of these questions points to potential costs in time money and other resources. You will want to consider them when planning the next move whether its to stay or fold.,Entrepreneur,dgewgpz,1,t5_2qldo

11667978,0,t3_66e4y7,You can get really niche with hashtags on Twitter. I was working for an electronic payments company and there were quite a few that were surprisingly very popular lower use of the hashtags but very engaged audience. Going too broad with marketing and what have you may not get in front of the right people since its likely to be a heavily used tag. Its easy to get buried. Do some research to hit the right ones. Hashtagify.me is a good place to start finding niche tags for free.  Also dont be afraid to schedule posts with a free suite like Hootsuite. Maybe do a few posts a day with unique copy that link back to your blog or other online presence. Picture tweets are nice as well. If youre able to snag some shots of you working with a client via video chat it gives you an heir of being trustworthy engaging and that youre actually fulfilling what youre offering.   Offer a discount to clients who leave you a review on LinkedIn or share your content. Doesnt have to be a ton  maybe . Consider posting your blogs directly to LinkedIn once a week and then linking people back to both your landing page and related posts that redirect to your blog. This will give you one way to funnel some traffic to your site  blog as well as provide you with some backlinks to help boost your search results. Another great way to do this is reach out to other blogs that focus on senior level positions but arent competitors and see if you can work on some sort of affiliate system where you backlink to them and vice versa.  If you do decide to link from external sites like blogs and LinkedIn I suggest you use UTM really easy to create UTM links with an extension called UTM Builder by EffinAmazing for Chrome. This will let you gather analytics by determining where your users are coming from specific blog posts ads campaigns date posted and more. That being said you will need an analytics service for your site like Google Analytics if you dont have one already. If you start seeing a trend from a certain medium you can begin to focus more of your efforts there.  Hopefully some of these pointers help you or anyone else looking to market really anything on social media.,Entrepreneur,dgikx5b,1,t5_2qldo
