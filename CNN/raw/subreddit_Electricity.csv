You then have to ask is . volt drop significant for my use? Increase to a milliamp x amps and the drop will be  volts!,Electricity,d6lvwy9,7,t5_2qzwz
8789793,0,t3_508wqd,As someone who works for a utility company I would HIGHLY recommend none of the above. Not only are you making it unsafe for you and whoever is living in the residence but also the companys equipment that is in place. There is technology we use to actively seek out customers who are trying to steal electricity and it usually doesnt end well Fines meter lock and paying for stolen power. If you are looking to lower your electric bill I would recommend seeing if your power company has programs in place where during different parts of the day you get charged a different rate. For example I get charged X during peak monthshours and than  price for the remaining monthshours. ,Electricity,d74edvq,3,t5_2qzwz
8882245,0,t3_51ubw7,Depends if your using an old cast iron tub with metal plumbing work or a new fiberglass tub with PVC plumbing..Old cast iron tubs will shunt the electricity straight to ground via the metal pipework. as long as you DO NOT physically touch the plugged in appliance you will be ok in theory of course. It also depends on the proximity of you vs the item vs the shortest path to ground.Newer fiberglass tubs and PVC plumbing would not allow current to pass as easy Water is a conductor but not a good one and the cleaner the water the poorer of a conductor it is. HO itself does not conduct its the impurities in the water that are conductionsI am not going to test this theory and I do not recommend anyone else doing it either so your best bet is toALWAYS keep LIVE ELECTRICITY AWAY FROM PEOPLE IN WATER!,Electricity,d7fiqj7,-1,t5_2qzwz

9905860,0,t3_5hatxv,Im guessing this isnt the problem because you said you flipped them but some arc fault and gfci breakers trip because of a fault but still look on.  Since you said bedroom it could be an arc fault breaker.  In canada and the US theyve been required for a few years now.  Along the same thread those circuits could be down stream from a GFCI outlet that has tripped.  Unlikely but some places are wired really weird. edit I see you didnt say bedroom but I assume thats where the alarm clock is ,Electricity,dayr98b,5,t5_2qzwz
9909903,0,t1_day72wf,I was thinking that after I left for work that you could have just threw out. I figured you wanted to keep it in for some reason. Im glad that all worked out. But on the other side of things. I have a mixed set of emotions when it comes to the government outlawing incandescent lighting. I do service work and a light bulb plant we would work at went to Mexico disappointed. I like the power consumption to light ratio of a good LED. Its kinda amazing how good they are getting and the options. I hate a CFL they take a life time to achieve what a stinking incandescent outputs instantly on start up. Actually I got one we turn on for a few minutes before bed and then turn it back off and it seems dim the whole time. It shouldnt bother me as much as it does. But in this crazy power hungry world cutting back the average amperage consumption in a household doesnt seem like a bad thing. Even back to the s and s a house could be just fine with a  amp service in a house. Now I go to Lowes and they are selling the shiz out of  plus amp breaker panels and it dont seem like enough in a modern home. I got a old house with a  amp service and we have issues with the back bed rooms like all the time. Actually what I would like to see is video game systems reduce the power consumption. Not sure if it is still like this on the newer systems but my original xbox I had pulled like  amps... I put it in my truck on the fold out radio display and every so often it would cut out cause the inverter would get SOOO hot after a while pulling all those amps. But i digress gotta take the good with the bad. Glad to hear your all fixed upTLDR Redneck electrician ponders the double edged sword that is modern power usage and the devices we are now stuck with. ,Electricity,daza7xu,1,t5_2qzwz

10351941,0,t1_dch35ka,The average current was only . milliamps to the tube. Which put out a dangerous amount of Xrays. Here is the tube operating at  power. Those two meters are cold war radiation meters to be used after youve been nuked!  This is the main cable This fed a secondary cable which was as small as RG coax but with FEP plastic insulation. That is where we were getting breakdowns.  The peak currents could be a  amps but only for s of nanoseconds. So the system was energy limited. The main cable never broke down only the smaller one. So it could not blow up but having to replace the cable every time the tube arced was a costly pain.This Xray was used to radiation treat the cavity after a lumpectomy for breast cancer.This was the company that I consulted for.  Note how small the Xray tube was. Which why we needed a transistion to a very small cable to lead into the patient. ,Electricity,dchgbaz,1,t5_2qzwz

10897913,0,t3_5vq6v6,gt . hours average per day exposure to direct sunlight in order to generate the expected yearly capacity ?Almost it would be a theoretical . hours per day of full generation to reach that average annual generation. . MW is the capacity the term capacity simply means the maximum rated output of a generator.The key here is that no generator is producing its maximum rated output during all hours of all days of a year. A solar panel is not producing energy at night and not producing full output unless very strong sunlight is present. The capacity factor of a generator is the is the average output of the plant divided by the maximum output of the plant and is helpful to calculate.If the plant produces  GWh in a year then on average it is producing . MW of power through the course of the year. Divided by the maximum output of the plant  . MW  we can see it has a capacity factor of . This means accounting for all downtime and all hours where it does not have full sunlight you can expect it to generate  of its capacity.The EIA reports that the average capacity factor of a PV system in the US was . in . This plant is slightly less effective likely due to the fact that most of Spain is at a higher latitude than the continental US and likely gets less sun.,Electricity,de41jbu,1,t5_2qzwz

Its worth noting that if the battery isnt ideal internal resistancelimited current then it will never measure v exactly.Unless the measuring device is also ideal meaning it doesnt draw any current all practical meters do then it will only measure exactly v when the wire is removed.,Electricity,de64m6j,2,t5_2qzwz
