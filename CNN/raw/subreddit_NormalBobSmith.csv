4125236,0,t3_37m0dv,I can confidently say not only has it always been a place where the fringe gather and its had that reputation for quite a while Velvet Underground even sang about it in the s but Im still pretty unknown there. Coincidentally Wendells Hat Thief just asked me to take his video down because he showed it to his parents and they were very disturbed by it. He genuinely had no idea who I was until a week or two later when he finally saw the video. Id bank my reputation on him not being fake. Hes just that weird of a kid.My videos are really not all that popular. I dont get millions or even hundreds of thousands of views. They usually max out at  views after a month which in comparison to everybody else on the Tube isnt much exposure at all. Its just a wacky park in the center of New York City. And thats exactly why Ive been hanging out there since .The only fake crazy I can think of who goes there to get attention amp be filmed is Matthew Silver. Which is precisely why I dont film him and Im often asked why I dont.,NormalBobSmith,crqi30n,3,t5_34jip
4886635,0,t3_3hqe71,thanks for following up and posting this.  its probably a simple yes but ill ask anyway  is the first video included meant to be private?also contructive criticismfeedback there is a small missing part on the Crackhead Tony section.  For me it displays asTony was openly a heroine addict but the adrenaline he showed wasand cuts off then the next paragraph continues I posted the video as is..etc,NormalBobSmith,cuahyn6,2,t5_34jip
