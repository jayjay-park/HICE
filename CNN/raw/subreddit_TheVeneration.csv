The Layrite never really worked that well with me it felt more like a really thick gel and dries a little crunchy which I did not care for. It certainly works for some people just not me. the groom amp clean was actually pretty decent too. I figure a lot of these old school products are like  a piece why the hell not try them all.

I have a lot of really really fine hair and products do not seem to work well on it but...I think I may have found a solution. I went to a really great stylist who recommended Bumble amp Bumble Sumo Wax... Does not have quite the shine as Murrays but the hold is incredible even after the helmet.. Ive been towel drying thoroughly and applying a surprisingly small amount and combing it through making sure to get the roots. Its ridiculously expensive I paid  but like I said it doesnt take much and well its the only thing Ive found that actually works for my dickish hair.,TheVeneration,cjnqh8x,3,t5_32x3i

3868222,0,t3_34q5re,Ah food. One of my favorite subjects. So on a path to get healthy its hard to find snacking substitutes that I actually like when Im in snackattack mode. regular general snacking isnt too bad since Ill usually grab some veggies or couple slices of deli meat but sometimes I just hulk out and Ill easily destroy an entire fullsize bag of chips or a container of cookiesSo Ive made a list of a few things that I eat now when that salty or sweet tooth attacks and I turn into an angry blobasaurus and need FOOD NOW so quick and easy to make.Homemade kale chips I sometimes sprinkle chili powder on them for some added kick. Cheaper and healthier than a regular bag of chips for me since Ill buy a back of chips and eat the entire thing if in snack attack mode. One bunch of kale is cheaper than a bag of chips and I generally get several batches out of a bunch. Banana ice cream Sometimes Ill mix in a little peanut butter.Veggies and guac. No recipe since I just buy a thing of premade guac and a precut veggie tray the one the grocery store makes. Or sometimes just carrots. It really depends on how Im feeling. Random fruit that I will eat an entire container of. Like strawberries if theres a sale going on or a large container of precut pineapple also helpful because I wont eat anything else during the day because OWOWOW MY MOUTHI also live literally right next to a grocery store so when the snack attacks happen I quickly throw on some pants and a clean shirt to quickly grab what I need and get out. ,TheVeneration,cqx7lnq,2,t5_32x3i

I was reading the Welcome To The VenerationWhat the Hell is The Veneration? and really liked that I saw it condemning misogyny xenophobia racism etc. Ive been into the old school for lack of a better term thing for quite a while and was a little concerned that some people might misconstrued it as promoting conservativeism and a return to classical ideas of manliness. This community has reassured me that you can enjoy the aesthetic of the past while ditching all the dated political views. Thanks!,TheVeneration,czmi73b,3,t5_32x3i
