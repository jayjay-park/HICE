1495,0,t3_1tyeb8,Mind your language. There is a very big difference between saying for example It was almost like a high things got crazy and I had a manic episode. Think like a doctor explaining something to a patient you dont want to use terms that might alarm someone and you want to sound like you fully understand the subject. As you go on and this person becomes more in the know about your struggle with this illness its more suitable to use emotionally charged language. But since you dont know her background keeping things in clinical neutral terms makes sure she wont get overly alarmed. This is a good skill for allot of situations and it takes time to develop so dont be hard on yourself. Good luck man.,BipolarReddit,ceelx3f,1,t5_2qzru

It takes on average over  years for people with bipolar disorder to get an accurate diagnosis. I believe its  Being sure about this lets you now focus on wellness. BTW. I am on mg of Lamictal and mg Luvox ssri and feel good. Still have my depressed days.  good  bad I cycle. No memory issues. If you do give it time to set it or find another med.

694208,0,t3_2245q7,It is normally a psychiatrist who diagnoses you with a medical illness like bipolar disorder not a therapist its known to be done but doesnt make any sense.  You may be able to ask your friends for a recommendation to one or call your local chapter of NAMI www.nami.orgUnfortunately there are no tests for bipolar disorder or pretty much any of the other Axis  mental illnesses out there.  There are questionnaires and professional opinions and that is it.  Until we can actually get a good picture of what is going on in the brain on a neuron level we are kinda stuck in the dark ages.Bipolar is an illness that has two basic categories BP and BP.  BP includes full blown manias that involve psychosis such as delusions thinking you are powerful able to become a nobel peace prize winner for curing SIDS when you didnt even pass biology thinking youre jesus etc visual or auditory hallucinations grandiosity spending everything you own on completely misguided delusionary ideas  mania must include an unawareness that you are acting out of the ordinary at the time of episode.  The depressions for this type of BP are immense.  They are as low as the highs are high.  BP does not get as high or as low.  This is a clinical diagnosis and does not mean to claim that BP is somehow less horrible of an illness to deal with.  Both are terrible and hard to get a handle on but the clinical differences are important to diagnosis treatment and predicting outcome.  BP usually get only up to hypomania which is also present in BP which is below mania.  Hypomania does not have a true break with reality.  So spending sprees are still grounded in reality such as buying too much clothing or spending a lot of money on the pool you always wanted but really cant afford right now buying so many things you need that you put yourself into dept.  There is also a propensity for casual sex risky behaviors irritability talkativeness thinking you are the life of the party being the life of the party a departure from your normal personality taking on a lot of projects with the inability to finish them or the loss of interest compulsion hyper focused interest inappropriate boundaries with people.  All of these things must be out of normal character must represent a different mood state from normal.Both hypomania and mania can include periods of euphoria but this is not necessary as now clinical portraits of the disease show that many people with BP and  get irritability and some paranoia without ever experiencing euphoria.  Also there is this new diagnosis of ultradian rapid cycling that drives me insane.  There is no such thing because the way that bipolar disorder works is that there must be a significant time spent in each part of the cycle to be bipolar disorder.  Maniahypo for at least a week depressed for at least two weeks and there also must be normal moods.  This rapid cycling disorder is convoluting the diagnosis with people who have other disorders and making research and treatment difficult.  Yes people can have rapid cycling but that only means that they cycle a few times a year not every few days or hours or as pure responses to stimuli.  There can however be mixed episodes which include the increased activity and impulsivity of maniahypomania with the deep and brutal depressions.  This is the most dangerous state because a sufferer is least likely to be protected against suicide.  I believe that doctors are now mistaking mixed episodes borderline disorder psychological unrest and hormone issues up and are beginning to put them all under ultradian rapid cycling due to laziness and unwillingness to pay attention to a patient for enough sessions to make an accurate diagnosis and therefore accurate treatment. When you look back at your life can you see significant times when you were hypo manic or manic in which you were not under the influence of alcohol or drugs?  If you can write down when and what happened how long it happened ask your family and friends to corroborate and head off to a real psychiatrist.  Be patient.  Dont ask someone to diagnose you in the first session.  Ask questions about possible medications that are relavent t oyu.  I assume youre young  so some questions could be. Does this medication have a tranquilizing effect I dont like tranquilizers because they make me ridiculously sleepy but some of my friends do really well on them..  How long will this take to work and how will I know it is working?.  Have there been long term tests on this medication?  I cannot tell you how many medications out there for our BRAINS are tested for only  month trials.  That is terrifying.  Especially because you are expected to be on medication for life with this illness..  Does this medication have any indications of causing rapid cycling or mania in people with bipolar disorder you think you wouldnt have to ask this but unfortunately you do.  Can I drink?  How much can I drink? Will this effect my sex drive?  .  what other things should I be doing to stabilize myself?  Therapy support groups sleep cycles food stress reduction?  What can you recommend? What should I read?  What type of therapy is best for bipolar disorder?I hope you get the help you need!  ,BipolarReddit,cgj6m6n,7,t5_2qzru

I was more troubled by their views of people with bipolar disorder and the real possibility that these are widespread.Christofascism is a real problem in the US. We are the most religious country on earth with an  Christian population and more believers in a virgin birth than global warming. The Christian right has been stockpiling hatred and firearms since the civil rights s. More recently they have assumed control of many parts of governmentespecially localwhich are now allowed to start meetings with prayer. Their view on psychiatric illness is that it isnt real and can be prayed away. If we suffer it must be due to our sinfulness laziness lack of character. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama was recently quoted as saying that the First Amendment only applied to Christians because Christians invented it. The rest of us have no speech protections. Business has funded the rights fabricated hatred of government to demolish protections for citizens generally in order to make them more compliant workers and consumers.The historical pattern in other countries over many years is that a majority hostile to the rights of everyone else eventually attempts a purge. It often appears without warning. The right even has a little fable about how the great sorting would come aboutthe Raptureand a hope that it isnt far away. They are belligerent and tirelessly threaten the rest of society. When the time comes do you doubt that they would demolish our rights or simply kill us? Its perfect for an inquisition repent or ...? Law enforcement has already jailed more of us by percentage or raw numbers than any other country. They kill us often enough without facing sanctions.All of this sounds like a conspiracy. It is and its working.

1097212,0,t1_cht03io,So it can sometimes be helpful to think of bipolar as a spectrum sorta like Autism. Different people fall different places on this spectrum and depending on where they fall the disorder can present in different ways. For some people they may never have hallucinations. For others they can frequently be troubled by them. Unfortunately there isnt really a simple answer about how frequent they are. It just depends on you. I can tell you that they can be brought about by medication changes and to expect some weirdness in general until your doctor is able to find a medication combination that works for you which could take months...and that is normal. Just make sure that you communicate everything youve noticed at every appointment so your pdoc is best equipped to make the necessary changes.Im afraid I really cant be of much help about the security clearance.

1141268,0,t1_chxza2g,No its not disingenuous. Many of these mass shootings dont involve mentally ill people. For example the official Sandy Hook report emphatically states that mental illness played no role in the tragedy. If you go back after the hysteria has faded and look at the findings youll see that mental illness was not the cause of the incident despite the blustering of fools like Nancy Grace and Dr Drew. Most gun crimes arent shooting sprees but its those crimes that dont hit the headlines that kill the vast number of victims. What is your focus? Random shooting sprees some of which involve mental illness but many of which do not? Why are you deliberately ignoring the other  of every day homicides? If you want to look at it that way we can find lots of other groups with larger shares of homicides types of weapons etc. If we stripped gun rights from men aged  that would really staunch the bleeding as young men do nearly all the shooting.Mentally ill people are th as likely as others to commit gun homicides. Alcohol was responsible in some form for  of gun homicides yet alcoholism and DUIs wont cost you your access to firearms. Go find other groups to focus on where we might see a meaningful reduction in the body count. Retired police officers and soldiers for example are far more trigger happy than average. Why stop at just discriminating against the mentally ill especially when the numbers say its a wasted effort.The big events get big press but the mentally ill are responsible for only a few of them. The real carnage is committed by others. Go look at the numbers if you somehow missed that point. What you think you know about this topic is refuted by the data. Please do the rational thing and change your mind. The bigotry against the  of us with mental illness is baseless and tiresome.

Sometimes contact sports work really well sometimes just being alone is enough to help maintain a peaceful demeanor.  for me i like silence.  i need my johnny time.  when my wife goes on vacation she takes the kid and visits family.  so she has a babysitter and can get out and do stuff she wants to do on her own.  and i decline going so i can get some extended me time.  i call it a staycation.  and again i cant stress this enough.  everyone is different and Im only drowning from what i know about my self from years of self analyzation and finally getting on meds that work for me.but as for dumping him.  its a legitimate option.  and i know its cleshay as hell but it is possible to not change but help people manage their problems.

First  days need to be dealt with somehow mine was paid out as vacation  really important if you have a use it or lose it policy. Then I was officially off work or inactive for the time I was paid STD no paid time off required. My policy paid  of wage to cap of week your policy may vary. When I went back to work part time STD topped up my pay until I got to regular salary. If you are under cap this means you get full pay on  time I was over cap so I had to work more to get to  pay.If STD is part of your benefits package ask for the form to start the claim then contact the insurance carrier yourself. My carrier straightened it out for me.I urge you to reconsider and take more time off work if you have benefits. Losing some pay now is much cheaper than getting fired. Your employer would probably prefer you to have a predictable schedule instead of coming back to work sick with ad hoc accommodation requirements and likely distractedpoor temperament due to depression and insomnia. Getting a documented disability really helps can make you harder to fire in a big company. I did a modified work program for bipolar and I wish I went on leave would have been easier and less stressful. I went on STD soon after for physical disability  I went back to work too soon and got fired cause I did a shit job. I really regret my short term thinking in getting back to full pay right away.

2422041,0,t3_2n6g97,JanieSan marijuana does interact with the type of pysch meds given to people with bipolar. I dont know the mechanisms because Im not a pharmacologist but from experience though I believe that for me there has always been a long standing correlation between my early drug use and predisposition to mental illness. Id had early onset symptoms going back to elementary school and middle school age.  My first time being put in a psychiatric hospital occurred the same year I first smoked marijuana at age . This was in . I dont look back to the time I first smoked marijuana  years ago and say to myself hey thats when it all started. No not just because pot caused it. I know I had  psychological problems long before I first smoked pot.  Maybe cannabis acted to me the way effexor or prozac might cause mania in a patient unknown to have bipolar? Cannabis was the first psychadelic thing I ever put in my mind. Months later Id be experience psychiatric drugs. Let us speak about  which was worse the  medicines they gave me at the psychiatric hospital or the pot when I just discovered smokingd.  Let me start by saying that my first pot smokes were magical. Looking back at it sometimes gives me nostalgia at the warmth and ambient  love I felt. A favorite childhood memory. Im getting jittery just thinking about how to word this. If youre still reading then thank you. Well now when they took me up to the psychiatric hospital they put me in the adolescents ward. A lot of bad things happened there so I will try not to stray off course. On of the worst things that happened to me began day  with the meds. Im not against psych meds but the misuse of them is repulsive. My  lb body couldnt handle adult doses of risperdal. I would get horrible side effects like complete restlessness insomnia anxiety...I was already in there because anxiety was destroying me this was like getting kicked when down. To top it off one day it was too much meds and this caused my neck and back muscles to arch uncontrollably and painfully and to want to stay contracted. Really painful stuff. So when I complained to the nurses and was brushed aside as just being some kid and told I was making it up. I ended up throwing a chair and being tied in bed to limb restraints.  All the while still Im having these jacked up side effects of my muscles painfully contracting and now i cant even roll over. That went on for a long time until a doctor passing by saw what was happening and had me given some benedryl which counteracted the effects. Thats like a drop of water in the bucket of how that place gave me and other kids ptsd. My first experience with meds scared me off to pot at an early age. I still smoke. I have an eight right here. I havent been on meds in over a year. Smoking while on meds still gets me high but it messes with the efficacy of the medications. Ill stop there. Sorry for the long piece. Im not against meds or pot or even bot I just think that everyone is so very different that it would not be fitting to say that what works fo one person works for another.  ,BipolarReddit,cmb2mns,0,t5_2qzru

Too much will either burn you out or start swinging you manic in my experience.My depressed and no energy workouts latest incarnation is a daily chart with  bodyweight exercises and a few home options for cardio. My daily task is to complete at least  plus  minutes of  cardio option. If Im energetic I do more or add a gym workout but even if Im absolutely miserable I can usually knock off  by doing  at a time and spreading them out. Im a bit nuts with charts I cant stand incomplete bits so getting all  boxes filled for the day actually helps force me to do something. ,BipolarReddit,cnpfoq4,1,t5_2qzru

I read that they were damaging in the beginning stages of development amp I really didnt want to chance it. I go on and off of them every year so I knew if I weined off then I would be fine for a few months until the depression really hit. Im currently  weeks. BUT I spoke with my pregnancy doc about the meds because I hadnt mentioned the depression and bipolar disorder and she told me a study came out last year for both of them saying that there were no negstive side effects on the fetus when taking while pregnant. PPD runs in my family too and I really dont want that depression after my son is born so Ive researched and thought about it and once it hit my  week mark Im gonna start them back up on low doses so they are in effect when he is born hopefully he doesnt come TOO early if he is early I have an amazing support system though.

2996666,0,t1_co8jydb,I have to disagree that depression is the real problem. It feels worse but depression didnt make me blow all my cash and a few shady men or risk my life or think I was going to save all of humanity or nearly land me in prison for murder. I did not kill anyone but only because I wasnt lucid enough to realize that Grand Theft Auto was a less serious crime than Murder. Mania is that which causes some of us to go what I like to call batshit insane. Talking clocktower shooters type deal. Its not pretty. Of course it doesnt get that bad in everyone but having been fairly close to suicide with depression and murder with mania... Im going to say that I would rather have ten years of depression than one day of fullblown mania where I might be crazy enough to think I was doing the right thing by taking someone elses life. Also the difference between hypomania Present in I and II and fullblown mania Benchmark of Bipolar I is actually pretty clear and its that psychosis various forms of losing touch with reality is present in full blown mania. Just to be clear. Its been made somewhat evident that depression seems to have on average a longer duration and often more severe effect on people who are Bipolar II. The distinction is actually quite useful in that psychiatrists can better select medication... For instance an antidepressant might be fine for somebody with Bipolar II but if its Bipolar I it will probably induce mania which is very very very bad. ,BipolarReddit,co8lolg,4,t5_2qzru

Imagine watching Inception and how shitty of a movie it would be if it just ended in the middle somewhere no explanations no warning just rolling straight to credits. It would be a pretty lousy movie right? Certainly not something held to a high regard anyways. But those same scenes followed by some resolution suddenly become a work of art. Right now youre only in the middle maybe even the beginning of your movie. To think of ending the script here would be a mighty shame because youve just got so much room to extend whatever plot you might dream of fulfilling. I say as long as suicide forces its way onto the table for you you need to get nice and selfish. The only road suicide leads to is death so do whatever you can to help yourself because your only other option is death so why not? As long as you dont hurt anyone else why should you feel unable to ensure your own quality of life? The government doesnt care about you or I as individuals with individual needs so someone has to be looking out for us and if you feel like you know enough about yourself to know that weed is what will sooth your ailments you should stand your ground and do what needs to be done. Im jealous that medical is even an option where you live! I live where its decriminalized so Ive just decided that Ill smoke as much as I need and if I get caught a few times Im just dealing with a ticket or two which Im very careful so I avoid such run ins.

This will help regulate your circadian rhythm and curb bad behaviors such as oversleeping and overeating. Also it will keep you from burning out when manic.Diet eliminate things that worsen your moods. This is not universal so dont buy into fad diets. For me coffee makes hypomania worse for others diet might have zero effect.Sleep this is nonnegotiable but often the hardest component of the five. Take more drugs if you need to and stick to a routine. Dont oversleep. Sleep time is hard but wake time is easier you cant force yourself to sleep but you can usually get out of bed and lie on a sofa or floor. Wake up at the same time every morning.When you get slightly better use the extra energy to improvemaintain your routine. Think of wellness as a kind of capital you have to invest wisely.

3611546,0,t3_31mygq,If youre gonna go scifi let me throw my idea at youI have a theory that people with mental illness with psychotic features be it bipolar mania or schizophrenia may have a part of their brains accessing and trying but failing to access information from other dimensions or parallel universes.  The reason why it presents as psychosis is because human brains werent meant to access or havent evolved to access those realms of alternate realities in the first place.  The manicpsychotic behaviors are a result of misinterpretation and struggled attempts to assimilate the information into our own personal human schemas.  The meds shut off or slow down whatever receptors there are in our brains that are making contact with those alternate realities.  Therapy has the purpose of focusing us on whats existing in the reality we are supposed to perceive or at least what the majority of the population perceives while sorting through and throwing away the intrusive information from realitiesrealmsdimensions where we dont physicallymentally belong.So if this is true logic is subjective and determined according what the unafflictedaverage mind perceives and doesnt perceive.  The treatment would be to program the brain in away where receptors receiving information from alternate existences are subdued.Real talk from college learning tho When brain scans are done of people who hear voices their Wernickes areas are lighting up. Scientists interpret this to mean that the voices the person hear is just their own internal voice Wernickes controls speech.  But what if its something else? What if theyre hearing a foreign interdimensional signalvoice that is only capable of being processed in the psychotic persons Wernickes area while the average persons brain is not physiologically equipped to do the same?Take the idea and run with it OP or anyone else.

Sometimes stimulants get used in severe depression for this reason but for bipolars we seldom get the opportunity because pdocs get scared about mania stimulants can make you manic in case that wasnt already a duh kind of thing. Stimulants can often increase anxiety though although for people with ADD that could work differently and actually reduce it I am not a doctor and dont know that one definitively.Im in the US and public hospital really just means it gets more money from the government here or maybe that theyre nonprofit. You still pay out the ass to go to one here.Where I am its hard to get admitted if youre not a danger to yourself or anyone else which your post doesnt really give me the impression you are you sound really depressed but not self destructive or suicidal and youre actually reaching out for helpa good sign. That doesnt mean its this way where you are Im assuming its probably not the US since we really dont use the term Uni to refer to undergraduatepostgraduate studies come to think of it we dont use it for much of anything at all and it also doesnt mean you cant get more help. When Ive been approaching crisis my treatment team has sometimes recommended I go in for an intensive outpatient program where you do group therapy most days for a couple hours or so. Maybe something on an outpatient basis would be easier to get intoget paid for?And Im sorry Im guessing youre not suicidal or at risk of hurting people but the fact that youre looking for help and seem to think things can get better isnt something you usually see in people looking to die.Good luck and feel better!

Like full blown hallucinations mania where you think everyone hates you. Trust me having been there I can say no one should have to live through that.Ask for viagra ask for a lower dose but dont go off mood stabilizers. Maybe talk about weed with your pdoc if its legal in your state theyll probably talk about adverse effects but they may feel its better for you to take it as an aphrodesiac and risk bad things when medicated and the risk is smaller than not to be medicated.See about different meds because flat and unemotional is not where you stop changing meds and say good enough.

5223616,0,t3_3mk3fu,A bit about me before I get on with it. I have Type  Bipolar Disorder ultradian cycling  which means I can experience violent moodswings within the same of a day days or weeks and posttraumatic stress disorder as the result of being raped as a young boy. Informed by both of these illnesses I have struggled with my orientation hypersexuality and substance abuse for many many years. My whole adult life actually.I have yet to put a label on my sexuality. Any chance to discover it naturally was robbed from me before I had any concept of it. Every time Ive ever tried to assign myself to an orientation Ive found myself feeling shame conflicted and generally less happy with myself than I was before. So these days I dont bother with that.I think the question that is imposing itself here is not one of men or women but rather what is going to make you happy. Having had sex or having sex again in the future with men does not in any way damage your capacity to love and be with a woman. And if you dont feel confident in identifying sexually one way over another dont. No one expects you to and if someone does by chance have that expectation they are not the kind of person you want in your life as they are more concerned with you fitting their view of the world than they are with you as an individual.A big contributor to your problems is going to be the substance abuse. Drugs of any kind when used habitually  as selfmedication obscure our ability to selfdetermine and make wise choices or even consider wise choices.Dealing with these problems takes time especially substance abuse. But it needs to be done.What is in the way here is not so much this attraction to men  those feelings of empowerment. Its whatever else is underlying both your substance abuse and those feelings of empowerment. Those are the things you need to put under a microscope and work through. The only person with insight into that is you.Anyway those are my thoughts on it as someone who still struggles with substance abuse and the question of his sexual identity and forming healthy relationships. Take it or leave it.,BipolarReddit,cvfmycz,3,t5_2qzru

A lot gave me bad side effects so I never got to find if they worked. Topamax was like a wonder drug but the side effects were so severe I couldnt continue on it.I am now on Lamictal. No negative side effects all the wonder drugness of Topamax I feel and not to extremes without extreme causes.TLDR  Yes I also found antidepressants to be the opposite of helpful and had two different psychs tell me it was because the depression isnt the only issue I have and I need a mood stabilizer which is good for either bipolar or bpd since they cant agree which I have.

5565206,0,t3_3rane4,ukaliena probably has a great reply based on what I can get my barely caffeinated head to get around to reading but Ill answer too.For starters sometimes mania can be a pretty good thing. Generally when its good its called hypomania and is pretty under control. But that kind of mania has enabled me to do  Calorie workouts start and complete semester long papers in  hours be charming enough to make plenty of friends entering college get my shit done and have the passion and interest to learn so very very much. Its kind of like being on amphetamines in fact amphetamines have induced it for me. Your senses feel more acute you think faster have what feels like an unlimited supply of energy injuries hurt less and it can kind of feel like a super power. To a point where it makes being bipolar seem like its not all bad and almost worth having.That being said mania isnt always good. For many people even hypomania includes pretty intense agitation and anxiety. And it often comes with insomnia which is often quite a drag. Also when you get severely manic to a point its no longer called hypomania you may start to hallucinate and believe things that to other people are blatantly false. You can get pretty paranoid. And the hallucinations and all that can feel really fucking horrible. For example I went a couple months hallucinating voices in my head thank goodness I could tell they werent outside my head telling me how much they hated me often people I cared about. They would interrupt my dreams and wake me up from them and it was generally extremely painful. Ive experienced heartbreak less painful. I think most manic episodes last something like a week or two but theres significant variation between people. My hallucinations continued after mania long into depression and I dont know how typical that is.Treatment can be pretty shitty since most medications can cause you to gain weight many can make you stupid and you dont know whether theyre going to really work for you or not. Plus paying for it can be pretty hard when you feel too shitty to hold down a decent job. Still its probably preferable to uncontrolled cycling and the extreme states you might otherwise feel.Then theres depression. For me during them nothing will be interesting almost nothing will feel good I might sleep a lot more Ill have no energy and feel generally exhausted most of the time I usually will feel physically and emotionally pretty bad pains hurt more I think slower everything feels overwhelming and death often feels like a pleasant alternative to continuing to feel that way.We typically spend about x more time depressed than manichypomanic although there is significant variation in this. For me I generally tend to feel shitty in cold weather and good in warm weather some people the reverse is true and others notice no trend across seasons although life events can trigger an episode to change or exacerbate the pattern. People who experience  or more of the same kind of episode depressed or manichypomanic in a year are called rapid cyclers although it isnt unheard of to experience multiple swings within a week or day especially if somethings off. Three times more days depressed than manic or hypomanic in both bipolar I and bipolar II disorder. Kupka et al. Bipolar Disord. .I had more but I gtg.,BipolarReddit,cwmwxg7,3,t5_2qzru

6200011,0,t1_cyud236,A good set of questionsBipolar most commonly is a period of mania shows up as euphoria rage anxiety excitedness anything with lots of energy followed by a period of depression the opposite low energy sadness lack of emotions all together sleeping a lot suicidal thoughts which is then usually followed by a stable period where we are neither manic nor depressed. It is a bit more complicated than that but that is the general gist of it. Notice what I didnt say there though how long each period lasts. This is different for every individual. Someone with a perfectly typical bipolar  diagnosis will have an episode that involves around  weeks of mania followed by  months of depression with a few months of stability following. I am a rapid cycler my mania and depression usually cycles on a weekly basis  week manic  week depressed  week stable although this shifts fluctuates and changes over time so while it is often predictable it isnt perfectly so.Additionally I often get a brilliant idea during an episode and continue running with it for a very long time afterwards. I decided to quit my job and go to college in a manic episode once many years ago. I then spent the following  years going to college all thanks to a  week long period of mania. This doesnt happen to me as much or as severely these days but it still does happen.Honestly it is a crapshoot. Hope for the best be patient and apologize for your side of things honestly and for as long as he is upset about it.

It was anger that completely consumed me to the point of my whole body tensing and the only way to stop the rage and pain was to cut. And not just cut  I would take dull object and scrape them to kind of tear away the anger. I felt the only way to get rid of it was to bleed it out.Honestly I stopped because of religious reasons. I was taught that my body is a temple of god and was given to me and was special. I got a Tshirt an object in particular that was very meaningful to me and destroyed the object that was precious rather than myself.Years later after that was no longer enough I got a tattoo in the place I used to cut as a remind of the reason I stopped. Not saying your  year old should get a tattoo lol but a physical reminder was a life saver for me. Another aspect that might be helpful is that I didnt understand why it made people upset.

Thatd be enough that I could put  into my car payment instead of the minimum  and keep the loan in line with the value especially if I go and live with my grandma. Then Id have an extra  a month. So thatd be good. Get a savings account built up so when this happens again my parents wont be burdened. And repay some of the  grand theyve given me so far.

7162121,0,t1_d1s7xly,I recently got diagnosed with ADHD but the BipolarADHD specialist made sure to point out that theres huge overlap with a lot of mental health problems and in most cases its not just a binary case of having X or Y especially with ADHDBipolar. Melancholiaapathy symptoms are pretty similar to something like inattentive ADHD.My first appointment near Christmas was just an initial checkup with him I assume my appointment in June will probably look at adding a stimulant to help with my concentrationmotivation problems. Poor NHS staffspecialists are way understaffed unfortunately.In the meantime I rely on things like ModafinilCaffeineNicotine not tobacco etc. to keep me going. Since ADHD isnt really diagnosed much in the UK I imagine its not very easy to get a hold of stuff like RitalinAdderall. You can just import Modafinil though for personal use since its a prescription only medicine but not a controlled substance.It didnt help at the time I got my first appointment with the guy I was trying selfmedication with memantine as a moodstabiliser not via any of my doctors. He was a little perplexed my other doctors Ive seen know I try to do my reading up on things but I probably looked like a bit of a nutjob pointing that stuff out on my first meeting with him. So in the meantime Im back on the valproate instead when I much preferred the memantine.EDITIf youre having problems concentrating Id make sure to point it out to your doctors.

8002063,0,t3_4oruta,Its generally considered safe and requires less constant testing and dosage maintenance versus Lithium or Depakote.Dosage administration guidelines you can read online include starting the dose low and increasing it slowly to avoid a bad rash named StevensJohnson syndrome so make sure to talk to your doctor about this and how heshe plans to slowly raise the dose.Outside of that is generally quite safe and effective. Commonly reported side effects on these forums include hair loss and most often  some difficulty in word recall during conversations. I can confirm all this since I have taken Lamictal mg x a day for  years.Probably will take you  months before you get up to the therapeutic dose that works for you and you start to see the real effects of it in the long term.

8548359,0,t3_4wuab5,I so agree with you about sleep! Lack of sleep is a major trigger for me as well. My doc prescribed hydroxyzine. Its an antihistamine. I was on mg but that made me really groggy the next day. So now I usually take mg. Its not  effective and sometimes takes a while to kick in but if I take enough I know I will most likely fall asleep. And its nonhabit forming.Ive also taken amitriptyline for depression and that KNOCKED me out. It was actually some of the best Ive ever felt in terms of my bipolar. I am also on Lamictal so my hypomania was not triggered. However I was a total zombie the next day. And it made me gain weight. So I stopped.

8549982,0,t3_4wvhz2,Not necessarily all of what you mention has to do with bipolar. I try to be careful with attributing everything to my condition. A sudden religious conversion is not something too unusual and a lot of people make sudden changes in their identity when in their twenties. Being caught up in academics is nothing drastic either really. As to my own experiences my hypomania can result in me suddenly taking up a hobby sometimes expensive which I have no interest in once I am stable again. Sometimes also considering drastic life changes but I usually never get that far before landing.As for the stripperprostitution thing that sounds a little extreme to suddenly start doing. My ex started stripping for a while for the thrills and she has no diagnosis. But actual sex for pay is different.Most prostitutes do it because theyre in a difficult financial situation and its the only way they see to make money. The luxury kind because it pays really well per hour.

9070292,0,t3_54i22u,Hello.A couple of things to think about Zoloft is an SSRI. That class of drug is best and most often used for Depression Anxiety and OCD. Often what that means is that they can help with the depressive aspects of the disorder but in many cases fail to stabilize your mood address mania and can in many cases increase the likelihood of rapid cycling. Some people will find that an SSRI does a swell job of managing their disorder but for a lot of people with bipolar disorder something like Zoloft will lead to relief in a depressive phase but will ultimately fail to help stabilize you.Depression can be reactive as well as chemical. Ive found that a lot of the time when I feel like I lose ground against my disorder it triggers a really deep depressive cycle. The thing to keep in mind is that you can be sad independent of the chemical imbalance SSRIs aim to correct and that your lack of stability grossly magnifies that sadness to the point where it feels almost unmanageable. Two steps forward one step back is still one step forward. Life is worth living. Right now I dont believe that and Ill bet that you dont either but I think were wrong. We dont know everything we never will and giving up has a finality to it that says I know where this is going when I just dont think thats true. You may think you know where things are going. You may think you know things wont get better. You may think everyone hates you and that nothing has value but you dont know. Bipolar disorder distorts everything so making a judgement with a real level of certainty and finality when youre cycling isnt fair to yourself.I hope that helps and Ill just say the things I keep thinking to myself are Dont make life decisions in a cycle. I dont know everything. This is a marathon not a sprint.Thats probably more than you were looking for and I probably came across as an anonymous asshole knowitall but I dont really care. Drop me a message if you ever wanna chat.,BipolarReddit,d823oy0,6,t5_2qzru

9090369,0,t1_d83hus4,Wow you sure are good at describing what Im going through. Only this is all stick relatively new to me. It all started for me about six months ago. I had always had ups and downs but never did they swing to such wild extremes and mostly it was just dealing with occasional depression or anxiety. But six months ago my life seemed to be falling apart around me for the dozenth time and I just had a break down. I stayed up for three days and then tried to commit suicide by heroin overdose and failed at it but ended up triggering bipolar disorder in the process. So the extremes ups and downs are still a learning process for me. Recently I thought I was fixed whatever that means but it turned out I was just manic and when I burnt myself out and got super depressed that was when I wrote this originally. Now Im back on the upswing I feel great but Im not trying to convince myself Im just going to stay this way this time. Im starting to get it that this back and forth the ups and downs they are my new normal. Im going to have to be treated for it and a lot of work will have to go into it Im guessing and even then it might not help. So thats what Im coming to terms with or beginning to anyways. I wish there were a magic cure but from what I can see all the meds in the world dont cure bipolar disorder and they hardly even seem to help. So Im going to have to get used to this. It is what it is I guess. Ive always hated that saying but it really is applicable here I wish everyone here good luck in dealing with this illness its sure as hell no fun.,BipolarReddit,d84ikii,1,t5_2qzru

I get those moments reading articles medical journals and blogs and studies. I dig and pick so incessantly at it I almost think it a compulsion at times. I dont get the memory issues that often come into play with the bipolar. But I think I teeter very precariously on the thin and delicate line between  borderline end of the spectrum and bipolar . Ive posted this link before but maybe others will see it and feel the ding and connection I did when I stumbled upon it the first time.   It goes into a bit of detail on the connection between the bipolar spectrum and the borderline criteria. This is what originally got me on the topic of overlap misdiagnosis and dual diagnosis. Thanks for your reply. Im going to post something tonight. I hope people can be as interested in it as I want them to be. I really need more people like you fascinated by psychology! ,BipolarReddit,d87rrpr,1,t5_2qzru
9126367,0,t3_5565cn,I relate with a lot of what you just said. Ive been in therapy for  months now and the only thing I can say for certain is that Im more confused now than I was when I started. I try to use the hour I get every week to create an avenue through which I can solve an issue. Tools for next time ya know. And I spit and sputter along like an old rusty truck giving all Ive got. And in the end I still dont feel any closer to clarity or like the ground I stand on has any more substance to it than it did before. All this working and trying and processing to have very little to no movement... no wonder the therapist would give up on someone with BPD. Who wants to sit and coach someone through the same  basic life solving techniques every fucking week? I feel like you broken and fucked up. And I dont want to have to. But Im starting to just believe that its going to stay that way. Sure I want a chance at happiness. But I just dont have the happiness intake valve everyone else has. I have a great life I should be happy. And for reasons unknown. I just am not.,BipolarReddit,d88u9p1,1,t5_2qzru

9252187,0,t1_d8oge37,Nope sorry I should have said that as far as I knew that it was not the case. I am going by what my doctors have explained to me the bipolar people that I have met  thought the majority of those have been in hospital programs so they arent at the top of the healthy candidate lists and other anecdotal evidence knowledge of other manic episodes manifesting in people who are not bi polar but where caused by other illnessfactors. I think my point should have been better made.

Dont get me wrong were all jerks but the ones with any self confidence at all are bigger jerks. Its just the way it works. I was always somewhere in between. I could make moves and be smooth talking when I wanted to be but I was a rare one that wanted something real. I wanted sex too but I like real relationships. But I can tell you most us guys are just jerks. The guy that that sits in the back of the room and cant do more than look at you thats probably the guy whos real. As for getting rid of the pain well moving on and continuing your life is the best way to get rid of the pain. Seriously. The drugs and alcohol are only temporary. Thats how you put off the pain not how you get rid of it. And only leads to more bad decisions and more heartbreak. I promise you thats all it does. You are way too smart to be drinking and wallowing. Dont sell yourself short.  Thats the mistake I made and now I have the life of someone who didnt have my talents and intelligence.

It is not an exaggeration to say each year has been better than the last and we have a great relationship with no more arguing etc than most.I was diagnosed with bipolar II four years into our relationship. Prior to that my periods of depression were very hard as well as my period of accepting the ramifications of my diagnosis. Lamictal has been a lifesaver. I have almost no noticeable bipolar symptoms. I also do not drink ever eat fairly healthily and try and stay active. I was scared about pregnancy and I was extremely distressed at about  weeks when I was having uncontrollable feelings of upset and anxiety which really scared us both. Luckily pdoc just diagnosed me with a serious case of the pregnants normal hormones which settled. Ive been pretty lucky postpartum as well.

I havent had alcohol since December. Sometimes Ill just have soft drinks in a pub. Ive done it on dates and with new work mates and people from groups. Its actually a lot easier to chat sober since youre alert. Noone assumed I was an alcoholic. Youll start to notice that a lot of people dont drink but never mention it. Just leave that part of your dating profile blank. Theres no obligation to tell anyone and its not a big deciding factor.I have a whole cupboard just full of tea. People started to give me it as birthday and christmas presents when I was diagnosed. Every flavour of green chai decaf fruit herbal and different strengths of black. I hated tea up until two or three years ago. Sometimes I have it with ice for a change. Just stay off the energy drinks. I dont touch drugs. I had an ex who did for a decade and he went from being the smartest person I knew to the most boring and stupid. Hes mostly off them now and no longer a nightmare to talk to. Similarly a longterm friend was telling me about how awful his bipolar friend is and was shocked when I said I have it. He kept repeating no you dont... The difference is I dont take MDMA LSD and binge drink so Im not in and out of hospital like his friend. She even asked him to bring her drugs while she was inpatient.

Not everybody experiences anger for instance. As for mood swings  I think sometimes the mood swings are  in response to triggers we just experience them more extremely.

11264977,0,t3_60ri4n,If this is happening at work it is illegal. Mental health is a protected class and you cannot be discriminated in anyway because of it. Also nobody can talk about your mental health when you are not present beyond what is absolutely necessary i.e. communication between managers he had to leave early to go see his doctor ok he left early because of his bipolar not ok. If people at work are openly questioning your actions because of your bipolar as soon as you can if you need to take time to calm down do it you dont want to have this type of discussion when youre even slightly agitated let them know that the accusation they are making is illegal and if they do it again you will register a complaint with HR. Take to opportunity to have a discussion and let them know your complaintsproblems are valid and should not be dismissed. I am assuming that you are in the US if you are not then I dont know what your labor laws are. If these are your friendsfamily tell them to fuck off. Maybe not that strongly it really kind of depends on your relationship. It can often be difficult for loved ones to help and understand our disease as one of the other posters mentioned.

Ultimately you need to have a discussion with whomever is doing it. No problem has ever been solved by not talking it through. ,BipolarReddit,df8vabi,2,t5_2qzru

11301681,0,t1_dfcjca6,Thank you for your insights. There are such striking similarities and dissimilarities in experiences of this illness. If it could be done I would love to compare a whole lot of clinical charts of the progress of mania e.g. alongside each patients firstperson account.My experience of goal pursuit in hypomaniamania is disorganized. I tend to take up goals and abandon them freely. At a certain point just contemplating a goal seems to be enough to stir me up whether or not I pursue it or complete it. Ill start a dozen projects in a single week but unless Im accountable to others its easy to flit from one thing to the next. Any one thing is as fascinating as any other. Its arbitrary which one I devote my time to.I think I know what you mean by avoidance of danger. I get terror distrust fear or everything in myself or in the world. The switch is sudden. I get that if my episodes go on too long. I had always put that in a different class than the goaldriven euphorias but I guess thats mania as well. I dont know how it fits into that staging model I linked stage  maybe?Thanks again for your comments. Its good to know that others understand.,BipolarReddit,dfd11qc,1,t5_2qzru

11376713,0,t1_dfl6nu3,Im not sure why someone downvoted your comment. I thought about it and cancelled meeting up today. I think youre probably right. Even if he isnt any sort of risk Id always on some level worry that I was being manipulated because hed lied at the start.Im sure the only reason I put up with people whose behaviour I dislike is that most of my good friends moved away for work. I should  make more effort to go to writing or running groups etc. and meet people.,BipolarReddit,dflj4p1,3,t5_2qzru

Then WAM thrown back into mania  then depression over and over and over again. Its the most exhausting and confusing thing ever ,BipolarReddit,dgeq010,5,t5_2qzru

11763718,0,t3_67tsq3,Will your professor let you record lectures?  Some of my students with disabilities did that.  Also depending on your documentation disability service centers can sometimes get you a notetaker.  Again that would depend on your documentation and what services are recommended for you.  Regardless its a good idea to register with your schools disability service office.  I worked for many years in disability service at a university.
