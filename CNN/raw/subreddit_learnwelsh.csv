7026180,0,t3_48nsjy,im so stoked on it man! i started  days ago amp im at lvl . ive been waiting forever for it to come out amp it is pretty decent i think. i agree that theres a lot thats not totally explained  and going on the website rather than just using the app helped although the there are so many typos in the tipsnotes!Anyhow the biggest gap for me is the fact that for the noun vocab we do get we dont know if its mascfem if its singularplural. drives me bonkers.I also think it should actually discuss mutation and give some guide lines.And i really wish there was a point where it was just like hey heres your generic sentences structure or verb conjugation for bod.its in beta tho so ill live... maybe. Well i guess these problems are kind of issues with duollingos entire system  a while ago i spent some time doing french as a refresher  i took  years of french thruout my edu aaaand ive dabbled a bit in a bunch of others.I want to learn welsh....for a lot of very strangestupid reasons i suppose. I have a BA in linguistics  so i guess its kind of imperative for me to have a random language obsession.,learnwelsh,d1crr6g,1,t5_3a9mm

9273876,0,t1_d8r183h,I went to a Welsh language school in South Wales so obviously I consider myself fluent in Welsh but I have to admit that since leaving school some  years ago Ive definitely become a lot more unsure of my skills in the language. It likely doesnt help that its hard to find another Welsh speaker in my area without flat out asking everyone so lack of constant practice is a problem. The Welsh language isnt really considered a part of the culture in South Wales you cant walk down the street and know youll come across it so I guess for a lot of Welsh learners in the south it almost feels like learning a foreign language. ,learnwelsh,d8rj3bm,6,t5_3a9mm
