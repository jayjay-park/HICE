4923814,0,t3_3i9ypw,I recommend downloading the DampD e Basic rules which are a free PDF available from Wizards of the Coast.  After playing RPGs for the last  years including every edition of DampD excluding e as well as Pathfinder e is truly the easiest to learn most robust and best all around version of DampD to enjoy.  Additionally there is a huge community that has risen around it and there are only a few books if you decide to purchase them meaning that the investment cost of money and time is low.  Im not on Roll but if you need more specific information or have specific questions PM me and Ill be glad to help.,roll20LFG,cuf6omf,1,t5_2u8e5
