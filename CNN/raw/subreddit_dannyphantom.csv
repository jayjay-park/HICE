8874559,0,t3_51t1ct,In light of the recent news about the possibility of a new movie or series or whatever I have decided to rewatch the series.  I loved it as a kid but mostly just watched random reruns whenever it came on so Im watching it all the way through in order for the first time.  Theres probably a bunch of later episodes I never even saw.  I did remember who Chaos was while watching this episode and thought it was neat how they used Sams hair before the reveal.,dannyphantom,d7elhw0,3,t5_2uldj
