6852628,0,t3_49kj8h,As ucolahan mentioned a lot of it is simply playing Zed a lot and testing your limits with the champion. That said there are a lot of minicombos and tricks you can pull off with Zeds kit. Ill mention a few that are particularly important and as Im not sure exactly how new you are to Zed theyll be fairly basic.WE combo It might sound simple but this is your bread and butter as Zed. if you cant land your WE combo then youre SoL. Obviously this doesnt apply in every case but this is pretty much the setup to every other combo you will end up doing and it is imperative that you learn to do this properly.Max W Range Note that Im not talking about the max cast range of the ability. You can swap with your W from much further away than your max cast range. This is extremely important and easily one of the most overlooked and undervalued skills of a good Zed player.Be Deceptive This might sound obvious but it takes a special mindset to always be thinking about the best way to throw off your opponents in every possible situation. Is there an unwarded bush next to your assassination target? How about throwing your W into the bush before ulting them and immediately swapping to maximize confusion. Is there a weird wall you can hop over multiple times to confuse your enemy? Great use it! Always be looking for opportunities to confuse your enemy. Zed works in the shadows and so should you.Learn His Combos Again this might sound obvious and Ive already given you an example of an incredibly simple combo. But Zeds kit allows for so much more than the simple stuff. Watch some videos of pro Zed players or high Elo Zed onetricks. See what kinds of combos they pull off over the course of the game. If you see someone do something unexpected or cool take note of it go back rewatch it figure out exactly what they did and how they did it. The thing about Zed is I could never possibly tell you all his combos because some of them are so situational you might only use them once in every  games but its always good knowledge to have. And again this sometimes just goes back to thinking like a Zed player.Hope this helps. Feel free to reply or PM me if youd like more info always happy to help ,zedmains,d0t1xw9,1,t5_34mx4

With the . scaling tho you approx have  AD depends on how much arpen u stack. . on the other hand of  is   so you would lose  damage instead of just .

Instead when you are in a position like that its better to just go all in W gt W gt Q gt Flash Q flash cancels the animation gt AA gt E E and auto animation happen simultaneously. Ignite if necessary I would do it just to make sure it goes well. This way the opponent has very little time to react as often they think you are just going for regular poke.

9827139,0,t1_daoehbe,how much pen did you have before the update? ? Thats what most people had.I had . If there is anyone here that shoud complain that one is me not you. Also if you go full lethalty runes and of course get precision and rush GB do you know how much pen you get? well thats only a tiny  lethality or  effective flat pen against a lvl target. How much armor does an Ahri have at lvl? . So you already hit as if  she had  armor. Wanna  go ahead and get a Duskblade after GB? alright thats  extra lethality making your total . Lets assume that same ahri is now lvl. you have  effective flat pen against her and she has  base armor now. The gap has already closed considerably. Lets get the Sorcerers bane after that. that will make my total lethality . Lets say that ahri is lvl now. I have . effective flat pen and she has well  base armor. I guess you already see the trend here... By the time she hits lvl she will still have less base armor than you have armor pen against her and you will have that advantage at about lvl? if you snowball it could be at lvl or as early as lvl. After that you will get a black cleaver and this means that whatever armor she purchaces aka zhonyas will be almost useless. of the time maw was better than Sorcerers bane? You mean  of the time that you were caught out and got ccd and of course almost killed and the shield saved you? How about having a spellshield and not getting locked down AT ALL? How about doing TOOLTIP damage while also having a free spellshield  times in the period you need to recharge  shield? Oh you hadnt thought of that had you?Do you also consider lvl late game? Its more like midgame. Also how about the damage that you do IF you hit your combo consistently? Oh well thats up to you.You can either cover up your weaknesses with some defensive items that will set your damage back OR get better at your own mechanics and use the tools that are offered to you.Your callP.S. In season  the most flat pen you could ever get in the game was  and that was if you had full pen runes and got a ghostblade. May i remind you that the old build didnt even ruch armor pen? You only got to lane a brutalizer after their first recall and  ghostblade wasnt bought until you had completed your Botrk. Some didnt even get a brutalizer and went straight for botrk.... So if you could do well back then when Seekers gave more armor and you had less pen than you have now with lethality then you should definitely do well now that Seekers gives less armor and rushing lethality gives higher effective flat pen than you could ever have back then. Unless of course if you couldnt do shit back then either.,zedmains,daohx4q,2,t5_34mx4

11439423,0,t3_635wj3,Cleanse is overkil. Qss should be fine. Her q is dodgeable. She will try to hit u through minions with her q and farm low minions with q. Get her low enough with a combo.

11541427,0,t1_dg3e0ct,Black cleaver is just too good to be replaced. What i really liked about DD if you are in one of those games where you buy maw you can still run  cdr runes and go ghostblade maw DD and still cap out your cdr which is amazing imo against high ap comps or some annoying ap matchups,zedmains,dg480pn,1,t5_34mx4

11669184,0,t3_66i5ha,Ive tried it a couple times and I find right now the tanks you face simply do too much damage to make it viable cant burst them because they have so much hpresistances but cant trade them because they outdamage you somehow,zedmains,dgipuib,4,t5_34mx4
11785728,0,t3_685zu1,Ignite hands down.Ignite isnt particularly useful later on in the game and your ultimate is essential to your burst pattern to kill a carry.,zedmains,dgvy9bx,1,t5_34mx4
