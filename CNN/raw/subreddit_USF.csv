2109461,0,t3_2j2nvj,I think the simplest thing that can be done to make USF a greener school is simply TURN THE FUCKING THERMOSTAT UP AT LEAST  DEGREES IN EACH BUILDING. Im a  year old male and I DO NOT regularly get cold in many locations however in seemingly EVERY building around campus Im certain the airconditioning is SEVERAL DEGREES cooler than it needs to be. I dont know exactly how much this could save but over the course of the year Im sure it could be tens of thousands of dollars. I dont see how USF declares itself a green school to begin with if every building is wasting so much energy daily. I see people with jackets in many of my classes studying in ENG and hanging out in the Marshall Center. We live in Florida and when you have to carry around a jacket to keep warm indoors during even the hottest months of the year something is SEVERELY wrong with that. ,USF,cl7yhpz,9,t5_2r3i8

The grade was based on two papers attendanceparticipation and a few quizzes.Class consisted of discussing discussing discussing. Mostly all we did was talk about the novels or talk about the novels context. The professor is really captivating though and he was never a bore to listen to. We also watched a few movies The Matrix and V for Vendetta.For what to expect I had the class once every week. Generally we had to have  of the novel read every meeting i.e. done reading each novel in  weeks.

Tell Dr. Skrzypek you wish to file an appeal for your grade your reasons what documentation you have and that the professor has been nonresponsive. Include the course number and section and consider attaching a syllabus and relevant documents if you wish to now. They will likely request this later anyhow.Ask for clear instructions on how to proceed including to set up an inperson meeting if necessary. cc the department advisor if you wish and the professor for the section.

Some do allow you to come as a guest but others do not at least from what Ive been told. I feel like fraternity and sorority life is pretty prominent here at USF. Maybe thats just because many of my friends happen to be part of greek life but you do see them hosting many events and at the Bull Market often.. When I studied at USF during summer B my friends and I went to many frat parties! Now that its Fall semester it seems a little bit more difficult to get in if you dont know a fraternity brother at the party or if youre not a girl.. Of course there are! You just have to look for them. USF is not really a crazy party school like FSU or anything but if you know where to look there are usually some parties.Some people might have different opinions but thats just my experience so far as a freshman.

Full disclosure  he went to UF about  years ago and is now at USF completing his undergrad so things may have changed. When I went to USF several years ago I found the additional internshipcoop opportunities in the Tampa Bay area to be beneficial compared to other friends at UF that needed to travel or relocate for a semester to intern. Both are great schools but in my opinion UF relies on its prestige and athletic programs to draw students in and puts less effort into creating a good learning environment for students. ,USF,de5yf49,1,t5_2r3i8

Im hoping I can maintain my B in the class.Its relies heavily on your ability to selflearn and you should be spending something like  hours per day on the class. But this is for Spring which goes for significantly longer than Summer. A lot of people have switched majors or dropped out because of this class. With that in mind I wouldnt recommend taking it during the Summer. BUT if you are still going to take it in the summer then I can provide more info.The tests dont have significant weight so you can still pass the class despite doing bad on the tests. The class will initially start with  hour lectures weekly and then it will shift to you reading chapters from a Java textbook and doing practice assignments along with weekly homework assignments based on what youve learned. You have  midterm exams and a final. There are also side assignments that can be difficult at times but they hold a lot of weight so they have to be done. You learn the fundamentals of Java. Nothing much more than that theres a second class. Intro to ObjectOriented that follows up on what you learned on COP. I plan on taking that this upcoming Summer. ObjectOriented is slightly easier so its not too bad but I would NOT take Programming Fundamentals during the summer. The Exams are difficult and you need help from others to study for them the class requires a lot of time on your part and the lack of individuals on the campus all make it difficult if not impossible to do good in the class especially given the lack of people and time during the summer. ,USF,dg39rwz,2,t5_2r3i8
