5701145,0,t3_3t7a61,Firstly I got chills with that Milne quotation I remember sitting down with my little brother watching Winnie the Pooh. Inspired as only a child can be...My reason for recovery is my future. A selfish cause to be sure but looking back on the past twelve years of my life had made things plainly clear. When given the opportunity to fight for a career advantage pursue a relationship or make something of worth I always had my vice to comfort me in its own cruel way.I refuse to entertain the possibility of my future remaining under this selfimposed shadow. Furthermore I wont be a moral hypocrite which is sadly the product of many habitual pornusers.This conflict has a way of giving us multiple reasons to stay on course but thats my chief one. I intend to keep that oath. I hope everyone else maintains theirs.,Saffron_Regiment,cx3s6ac,3,t5_3aqqy

5858098,0,t1_cxn8e5i,Hey that sounds pretty exciting to me. Remember anything can be as exciting as we make it. I like to think that the key to being successful sometimes is looking the part and that doesnt just mean looking the part that means that if you treat yourself to looking like an alpha your body and mind will fall in line. Whatever you get wear it with confidence and it will become you. ,Saffron_Regiment,cxnixag,2,t5_3aqqy

5975355,0,t3_3x6kcu,Im going to try and apply some science to this. Im not really in the field of cognition or neuroscience but they do overlap with artificial intelligence especially concerning reward processes.The chaser effect comes from the brains instinctive lust for more pleasure after its gotten some. It gets release and thinks hey great more please? But if it cant have more sex to get release itll look for other methods of release. Voil urges and the chaser effect.This is more deeply rooted in the brains inherent reward processes a theoretical concept of how conscious decision making happens and the biochemistry of the brain but the above is a summary based on my admittedly patchy knowledge. To beat it you have to get pleasure in other ways. As you have already written the gym works. Thats because physical does similar things biochemically as sexual release gross simplification but bear with me. The brain gets the pleasure reward it wanted and a nice sense of physical exhaustion to boot.The most difficult step of the process is the stepping away from the chaser and finding some other method of getting that pleasure. That is a hard decision because the brain is trying to tell you that you have a simpler option quite literally at hand. But what is life if not a series of hard decisions.On a language note what exactly is the peelers?,Saffron_Regiment,cy2wfed,2,t5_3aqqy
6438110,0,t3_43svl8,I think its a wonderful idea to have a schedule it will not only keep us on track but also keep us motivated. I think during Saturday we can do some physical stuff and work out well we should work out everyday but this particular day we can try to go beyond our limit.And also  since diet plays a big role in our life we can pack the refrigerator with fruits and vegetables for the rest of the week.,Saffron_Regiment,czl8m8v,3,t5_3aqqy
