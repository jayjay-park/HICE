I hold a  average and have a job although I had two while to school at one point. I would say that my dopamine levels are excessively high. I have been vaping almost every day for  years now give or take a couple weeks for tolerance breaks and will be going off to college next year vaping the same amount. I have gone to school baked everyday this year except for  days. Last year was similar although I missed a couple of weeks in total. Marijuana is what keeps me interested in classes that usually put people to sleep. For the past  years it has kept me in school because before I had marijuana I despised the world. Honestly I feel like your argument is completely opposite of my personal experience because it makes me strive to go farther prove people like you that you can succeed if you smoke marijuana. ,PKA,cfg08vj,2,t5_2u7e8

He could have at least invested the  bucks and cashed in on that titan fall hype. PEOPLE WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR GOOD CONTENT WINGS. And god damn when hes pissed off he needs to shut his god damn mouth. I want to use Vanoss Gaming as an example. Hes a little different because he makes funny gameplay but he always says He doesnt want to talk about numbers. People only know him for his videos. They dont know him from his arguments or they dont even know his personality. If people just saw PKA Wings and Wings on screen personality he would do much better.

770399,0,t1_cgros2m,Man I was looking forward to seeing how you would do. Me and my buddies did the same thing in Uwharrie in Oct. it was tough but it was a blast. Im the big guy of my group and lazy as shit and had the same concerns when we went out but it was easy.Stop by Walmart buy an axe and some gloves and beast out on some trees for fire wood. when you get tired sit down and break down the big pieces into smaller ones. Everyday youre gonna need firewood and thats when everyone is glad a bigger dude is around. Take care of the fire and campsite let the skinny guys run around for food.The cold will only hit that low at night for a few hours. if it gets bad wake up and get near the fire and throw some wood on it. that helps everyone out and keeps you warm. Take a nap later. Plus the thermal blanket  fire combo works better than you think its like a fucking oven.The whole no bringing food thing is a gamble. You might get lucky out there and find some good stuff. Uwharrie is the stomping ground to a shitload of hunters they already killed all the easy prey. That being said when you dont have food sitting in a fridge next to you you really dont get that hungry. just drink a bunch of water to fake fill your stomach.Whatever you know whats best for you I just wanted to see how another group of friends handled a survival trip at Uwharrie. Dont let the hate get to you. I think most people dont really understand how tough a trip like this can be. Hell most of them wouldnt even be able to handle taking a shit in the woods let alone last  days. ,PKA,cgruklk,1,t5_2u7e8

Wings livestreamed multiple times on Twitch which cannot have been prerecords as Wings commented on the Current view count.

786007,0,t1_cgtlk6p,That statement is false. I for one have not and probably wont forgive him. Yes Kyle and Woody only lasted a day But had they stayed Kyle probably would have landed in a hospital or worse dead. Wings didnt Want to go because he didnt have the funding for it or enough time to prepare.  month is PLENTY of time to prepare for something like this. He could have asked woodykyle for a loan. I am certain either of them would have just said what you need? and paid for it without thinking twice. He Not only let WoodyKyle down he let what fans he may have had down. I for one knew this was coming. Wings doesnt like to do things that are outside his comfort zone. He would rather live his life his way and continue down the road that will eventually brake him.I speak as someone who has and Still is battling clinical depression. On top of that I have Major stresses in life like a Job that requires Stupidly high amounts of detail and a small mess up means I get fired. So wings playing the victim card gets me really annoyed and makes me almost want to see him fail and fall flat on his face. But being the type of person I am I cant wish that on him. TLDR People have not forgiven wings at all. He let his friends fans supporters and anyone who had his back down. Wings has it easy compared to people who have Jobs outside of YT.,PKA,cgtmfwn,4,t5_2u7e8

Amends as in giving the person or persons in this case he harmed closure. You judge others by their actions but not their intentions and although wings never said sorry he still has remorse in his heart and wants to make things better.

931443,1,t3_24s9h2,Painkiller Already was never a podcast. A podcast was talking about current events it may be video games gardening politics etc. PKA was a show with a group of guys having fun. Everyone but Wings are podcasters. Wings mad it fun. I listened to nearly  hours of Civ talk. I dont like Civ. The only jokes are from at least  episodes ago.  people with Wings Kyle and Woody is fun. Lefty Woody and Kyle is average. Lefty Kyle Wings and Woody is gold. Lefty bounced off Wings with counters to his outrageous points. I hope Jordie gets back. ,PKA,cha5rd5,1,t5_2u7e8

Not bad but there are gaps during the conversation that I think wings wouldve filled and made the show a  instead of a . or  I know he will probably return eventually but the excitement has gone down a bit as well for a while now but I still look forward to PKA.

1027804,0,t3_25vft5,Few things from someone whos been doing audio engineering since he was . Hopefully Ive got a few things that are new to you two chaps.A general rule of thumb is you want you your signal in your IO to be as clean as possible. The Focusrite Scarlett i is generally regarded as one of the better choices because the preamps are super clean. If youre just running a mic or  this would be your best bet. It also doubles up for  line ins which I use for guitars and bass. Dual phantom power too. I understand with broadcasting you dont want to be fiddling around on screen so a preamp before the IO is also a good idea as this allows you to change your volume without having to do it through software etc. ART do some good cheap preamps that have a tube which adds some warmth to the tone.Im not sure if you guys have looked into compressors but they are great for achieving a consistent volume and adding some thickness. Something I would imagine to be super helpful in broadcasting. ART Tube MP Studio V may be a good option for a preamp as it also has some basic EQ settings in there. This may also be worth looking into it has a built in EQ and tube pre amp. Behringer MIC.uDrChiz Edit I havent heard the audio samples but the kick drum has a cut of db at hz which tends to be quite a muddy area. The db boost at khz adds extra presence. Normally Id work with the flattest response possible as I edit with software EQs in the box as this allows me to subtract and not have to boost in case I do need that frequency. Boosting bad subtracting good...as a general rule of thumb boosting means more gain.If youre broadcasting and the kick setting is giving you the best results by all means go by that! The reason that the kick setting is there is so the kick drum wont interrupt a bass guitars main frequency.The British EQ part is in reference to Neve channel strip EQ. Expensive but of course you can get emulations if youre after the famous analogue sound. Probably not worth it for what youre doing.,PKA,chl48ca,13,t5_2u7e8

Also if you can liberate other less threatening playerscity states cities go for it every time you liberate cities your warmongerer level goes down in the eyes of the AI. Also constantly have trade routs with AIs and always trade away your extra luxury resources both of those make AIs friendlier towards you.If youre having problems in combat Try to always keep ranged units in your territory also abuse naval combat the AI usually has a massive land army.

1118151,0,t3_26xbyw,Ok so I read your post long but good read and Ill try to fill in the disagreements you have.Woody might have been wrong with the obviouslyjesus thing.  If you saw Keystars newest vid about woody the only point that dumbass had was that Wings only donated to get him off of YouTube.  On the SEO thing. This was bad. If you saw the things Woody said wings did on the subreddit youd understand. Wings helped Elpresador hopefully you know his awfulness with woody along with others.  Finally Jackie had been on thin ice with wings since the desk ordeal when Wings mentioned bringing another person.  I think the Jackie hates Wings thing started after the survival trip by then all of the things you mentioned were done.I do agree that he needs help but he wont accept it. I believe Wings has Antisocial Personality disorder. It fits many of the things Wings has done including Manipulation Lying impulsivity or failure to plan ahead irritability consistent irresponsibility and lack of remorse. ,PKA,chve6v5,5,t5_2u7e8

One of them may be a selfmade wealthy kid but theres quite a degree of luck in that field. These are not wise people. Theyre normal at best and senseless at worst. And theyre all incredibly wealthy. Your argument is retarded. Beyond that Kyle himself wasnt necessarily a selfmade man until FPSRussia took off. His father is very wealthy and Kyle had that advantage. That isnt to say Kyle wouldnt have been successful without a fortunate upbringing  hes a smart guy certainly very wise and good with money as well. Hes also a great people person and a hard worker.

Grow up and stop acting like a child....gtyoure completely fucking retarded if you think otherwiseNone of this has anything to do with conversation at hand so why bring it up? Why must you start throwing insults and being personal in a simple conversation? Ask yourself that.Anyway Ive already said that I believe with no evidence at hand that some of his earlier videos are staged. Videos he made before he had many subscribers at all. However you havent mentioned any actual facts. Youre just making assumptions. Show me some actual facts and then we can talk about who is objectively right.Here are my facts. Vitaly and RomanAtwood were arrested for making the ATM prank. It was broadcasted across the local news stations and he went to court for it where dozens of subscribers met up with him. Its a fact that it was a real prank. Heres another fact Vitaly has been arrested for other pranks as well. This includes his Russian Hitman prank.gtAnd dont tell me you also think Fouseytube is real if so then you may be the most gullible person alive...I dont know who that is.,PKA,cj162hs,0,t5_2u7e8

1484455,0,t3_2b6mxy,Another mini point is that Woody Kyle ad Chiz made the video about Lefty leaving. This would make sense as Chiz has taken over from Heather as PKAs agent so itd make sense for him to be there. Also heather thought of herself as the behind the scenes th host so does that now make chiz SECRET TH HOST? Anyway my point is that it makes sense for chiz to take over as agent if leftys leaving as a lot of people wouldnt accept him as a host. Think about it lefty leaves the guys want chiz to be a bigger part of the show but know that people would fuss so Chiz takes on a behind the scenes role and Murka who everybody loves takes on the more public role.

1486560,0,t3_2b6wbn,I completely agree and I want to throw in my point that it FUCKING DOES take away from the show because even though it was on iTunes without the hosts permission it was still there. Now anyone that relied on iTunes has to wait a week and that does in fact take away from the show. I dont care what the hosts say it just does. If someone went to a grocery store and mopped up the floors for free every week and had no permission but they just let it happen then they suddenly forced the guy to stop and they decided to do it themselves but only every other week that does take away from the stores cleanliness.

By the end of the week like most girls shes gonna want to spend all of her time with him making him unavailable like he has been for the last year.

1597102,0,t3_2cjiux,I honestly cant see PKA existing without Woody. Hes been there from the start and done so much work to make the show better even persisting with it now that he doesnt really do Youtube for a living anymore. I remember the dark days of the show towards the end of when it was broadcast live constantly getting plagued by DDoSers. I thought for sure that the show was on borrowed time and eventually it would just be too much trouble and theyd call it quits. But they pulled through and I would not at all be surprised if it was largely thanks to Woody.Plus I mean the guy totally reminds me of my dad which I find hilarious. Damn right hes my favorite.,PKA,cjghfgl,1,t5_2u7e8

If this is true then it must mean he cleaned up his diet because I dont think the walking alone would cause him to drop  lbs.  And if he ACTUALLY cleaned up his diet Im quite certain hed be making videos about it or at least mention it.  But he doesnt.  I think Woody said it best.  Hes lying to us but more importantly  hes lying to himself.,PKA,ck1i9nb,10,t5_2u7e8

Also the way the host are attacking wings in a round about way on the show shows that he may have not been the only one doing or saying stuff but was the only one that was saying it out in the open and not hiding it.And at the end of the day its a show for entertainment and he was veary entertaining on the show more so then woody or lefty when he was still on the show. ,PKA,ckedg0o,-2,t5_2u7e8

1879658,0,t3_2g4u3a,Voting yes heres a few reasons whyReason number one is Trident. For anyone not in the know heres just a quick summary I took from wikipedia. Trident itself is an operational system of four Vanguardclass submarines armed with Trident II D ballistic missiles able to deliver thermonuclear warheads from multiple independent reentry vehicles. It is the most expensive and the most powerful capability of the British military forces.Most Scottish MPs voted against upgrading the system while the rest of the UK N.I Welsh and English MPs voted for. Its projected that scrapping Trident would save the UK over  billion or  billion give or take a couple billion.To move on to point number  from that is accurate representation. We currently have a conservative government. There are over  MPs in our government or members of parliament. There are  Scottish MPs. One of them is conservative. One. The people of Scotland didnt vote for a Conservative government but we ended up with one anyway. And finally since Ive been up since .am and its pm right now and Im trying not to nod off during this heres the final reason I have time to write tonight UKIP. A party which has utterly failed to make headway in Scottish politics that has gained significant traction south of the border in England. Theres a plethora of reasons not to vote for them such as their policy of wanting to cash in on the EU while not being a part of it and the fact they won MEP seats yet seem proud fo be seen as famed absentees. Just a quick google search will come up with results as bigots liars and racists and while that may just be media spin its plain to see if you go through their policies and interviews and compare the two.Now I know theres a few no voters here feel free to vote whatever you want. Im sure theres little I could say that could change your mind and little you could say that would change mine. But if you havent done research and are voting no simply because you dont know which to vote then just dont vote. Yes votes should be FOR independence No votes should be AGAINST independence. Those with no opinion either need to educate them in the coming week or just watch to see how the dice fall. Also apologies if my numbers are a bit off its late and Im tired and I dont really want to go searching for the exact numbers. Rest assured the numbers are accurate but perhaps not  exact.,PKA,ckfox31,3,t5_2u7e8
1880693,0,t3_2g5ey1,Being in school I am personally biased towards the education option.  It wont do any good for his mental state to work a dead end job and learning new things and meeting new people will do wonders for him as well as give his life a new direction.  Why he wants to go back to school for something he thinks may make him unhappy is beyond me as I think he should enroll in a local community college for an Associates Degree program and consider making the transfer to a  year program thus giving him more options.  Knowing Wings he is unlikely to want to defer gratification so its probably out of the question.  But if he wants to enroll in a type of trade program like EMT I am not going to knock him for it.    Unfortunately WingsofDepression is back once again and what is truly needed maybe more than a daily walk is mental counseling.  He is not going to be successful if his mind is not in the right place and the fact that he has locked all of his guns away is a clear sign that something is very wrong upstairs.         ,PKA,ckftejv,14,t5_2u7e8

Most of his vlogs hes sincere and really trying to be a good guy.Look at woody. Now being a millionaire he basically shit on robin Williams calling him a shit actor and undeserving of praise then flip flopped saying he was a good actor to get the backlash off is so negative about wings progress and doesnt give him any encouragement  claims subs hate him and doesnt understand why they do and overall a completely different person than he was in the earlier PKAs. ,PKA,ckugs8k,0,t5_2u7e8

By removing the the Hassain regime who was in fact a bad person he opened a power vacuum which eventually lead to the formation of ISIS. He still did not get his Weapons of mass destruction and cost thousands of American and innocent lives.

2071682,0,t1_cl2qawe,If you cant link it just tell me what thread he says it in and Ill search for that thread.PKA  Woody Its awesome yeah yeah and its all cause of this Patreon thing like Im pretty physced about it. Its motivating to make the show as great as it can be land guests like Harley etc.If youd think Harley wasnt getting paid youd interpret from that Harley was so impressed by the amount of money in the Patreon and impressed how well it was doing that he had to come on the show for free and be with them. Trouble is Harley has been on before without the Patreon fund being there. So why would he now have to come on because of it? What Im saying is that he is being motivated by the money itself as he is being paid for the time of being on there. And Im not even saying thats wrong. Its actually more professional.PKA  Woody So so Anthony has to boltWhy would Woody decide when Anthony goes? To my recollection hes never done that to a big guest before this. Unless they are paying Anthony for like  hours of show time...PKA  Kyle And you know Patreon is directly related to things like having Anthony on tonight.without the money the Patreon pumps in that wouldnt have been made possible I can promise you.Now. Directly related huh? If it was directly related then it would be the Patreon money funding having Anthony on. Though again you could say it isnt really directly related and instead indirectly due to maybe that idea again with the Patreon fund showing success etc. But shouldnt we take the things on face value? Otherwise we are just inferencing and not being correct. PKA  Woody Oh so since theres a break here lets pay the bills.Now I should explain the context of this more. When LinusTechTips was leaving Woody also had to change the sponsor. This could be the entirity of the comment bills but yet it might not. Again Woody decided that Linus should leave and suprise its around the  hour mark. Also Woody says that they are paying the bills before Linus leaves and a minute or so before they mention the change in sponsor. Its also best to listen to this one to hearsee how its handled.EDIT OK downvote brigade incoming I suppose. Well when you go against a circlejerk what else do you expect??

It came out of no where the forecast said that it would be a solid foot mid day. Then as school was starting to open like  a foot came too late to cancel school we all went. as the day went on two more feet rained down piling up. the custodians and janitorial staff tried to shovel. they ended up having to pack it down real tight with the treads of a john deer thing. then as the day ended and the school children fled the school we all realized we were jiped out of a snow day. the next day we had off even though i snowed very little in order to make up for the day before. plus last few years had been really bad with the hurricanes that hit us we had a week for Irene and  for sandy. that winter we were given no snow days even though the snow was worse than normal.,PKA,cm0z0ie,1,t5_2u7e8

2741176,0,t3_2rcfnk,Pretty sure Kyles already played on CCG servers. When he mentioned playing DayZ a few months back I picked up on something he said that at the time was exclusive to their servers. Also CCG had some good custom server software but now its out and available to anyone so no point in playing on their servers really. They over allocate server instances to actual physical server racks which causes massive performance issues and the A.I then has a delay in action and are easier to kill. If you want a good smooth server experience you need to play on the Among the Dead servers. A friend of mine is an admin there and he told me they only run two instances per server rack which is highly noticeable when you go up against the A.I.,PKA,cnfns4w,1,t5_2u7e8

Either each time the hosts do the postcards they look at who is Postcardapplicable and then send that person a single postcard. Or variantly theyd send them x postcards depending on x months of backlog the crew are doing the postcards for.

I just respect that dude and enjoy his company.  PhillyD if this somehow reaches you I hope your life brings nothing but joy and successAnthony Cumia stood out as a guy that knows how to be on a podcast.  Hes just comfortable and clearly spoken.  He doesnt have to be alpha even though he clearly can be whenever he needs to.  Hes just a straight up pro.FreddieW is a pretty cool guy with a ton of life experience to share.

It was Lefty that said that person would be Wings.  How do I take heat for that?   Ok maybe.  But I just pointed out that he wasnt dressing properly or bringing the right gear.  Thats pretty appropriate given the he acted like he knew exactly what to bring in spite of the fact that hed never been camping or hunting in his life. BTW he was lying about having a hunting license. On the other hand I was bringing extra stuff to keep him warm.  I actually brought it just in case he showed up.Ive heard how mean we were to him a hundred times. You know who was actually mean?

Because it needed Americas help desperately.  Or at least it thought it did.Its hard to say what wouldve happened if America hadnt shown up.  The US distracted half of Germanys forces so Im not even sure if the Soviets couldve defeated Germany since that country couldve just turned its forces in Western Europe around to defend its homeland although we have to remember Hitler was not that bright.  Im just mentioning that because if the Soviets HAD defeated Germany alone and America hadnt shown up could they have threatened Britain? That was another threat and probably went into the decision making of invading Europe itself.Anyway I think that the Americans helped but we didnt single handedly win the war.  The country we did end up saving was France  twice.,PKA,csjav6o,0,t5_2u7e8

I would much prefer getting robbed than bear the weight of killing a thief.,PKA,ctgtwov,1,t5_2u7e8

4658381,0,t3_3eqaod,For the record my view on this has evolved a bit.  I realize that OP is just having fun but I thought Id comment. What happened was that I donated to Filthy one day and he renamed a city and said Thank you.  It was cool.  Then he had some kind of computer problem so when I donated next stream nobody saw my joke.  He might have read it later but the timing was gone.What I realized was that it wasnt just a donation it was a product he was selling in my mind.  When my message didnt pop up I felt like I didnt get what I paid for.  I was bummed and I didnt want people that donated to me to be bummed also.So now this guy pays  and wants to see my dog. I can do that.  Im not going to demean myself but I also want everybody to be happy.  Its a tough balance to strike but I do my best.,PKA,cthqvre,63,t5_2u7e8

If you are required next year to start paying all  of your employees double their current wage that doubles the amount of your profit that you have to spend on your employees. So if you were paying your employees lets say  per year all the sudden you have to pay them  per year. In order to account for this cost business owners can do a couple things they could raise the prices of their goods or they can eliminate some of those jobs. So if the minimum wage across the board is raised its safe to assume that business small and large alike will raise prices and will lay off workers.,PKA,cufwvr8,5,t5_2u7e8

5230764,0,t3_3mhfgh,Ok its  not .  Heres a more accurate version of what he said.gt Harwood brought up that some have likened efforts to combat income inequality to Nazi Germany. Sanders noted sarcastically When radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president I think the highest marginal tax rate was something like  percent.gt Harwood followed up by asking When you think about something like  percent you dont think thats obviously too high? to which Sanders replied No.gt He continued What I think is obscenewhen you have the top onetenth of one percent owning almost as much as the bottom . So he really does think a top tax rate at  is reasonable.  Even if it hits the top  its still immoral to me that youd punish the wealthy like that.  You may think of them as evil wall street bankers but I think of them as people that own their own businesses and work around the clock.Also I think its just bad policy to punish the rich like that. Its been done before and all it does is make people work overtime to classify their income as outside the country.  At  better believe I figure out a way to host WoodyCraft.net somewhere else. Its just insane to keep it in the US at those rates.Also those other countries do not have a  tax rate.  Finally another major plank in his platform is the  minimum wage. Thats going to make jobs move oversees. Ive said it so many times that it has to be getting repetitive. Everybody is competing with the global workforce and automation.  If youre too expensive be prepared to find another line of work.Whats good about Sanders is that he seems to be the most honorable person in the race.  However I just dont agree with his policies.  Finally your explanation of his positions isnt very good.  You seem to imply that Denmark Norway and Sweden have over  tax rates when you lump them in with the tax policy that he finds reasonable.  And to say that  is a COMPLETE LIE when we were just off by a bit is also pretty disingenuous. The guy loves to redistribute wealth and its a super popular message for two reasons.   People love free shit.   People love to hear that the reason they arent on top isnt their fault.  Sure you studied Gender Studies in college and now you dont earn what those guys with MBAs earn but thats not your fault.  Sure you fucked up in high school or failed out of college but thats not on you.  The right thing to do is to take from somebody that didnt and give it to you.  The system is rigged against you so you cant get by anymore its not that you havent made the right moves to earn money.This world is filled with people looking to buy things or pay for services.  If you dont have any value look inwards instead of asking Bernie for a raise. ,PKA,cvghy2m,9,t5_2u7e8

Lets be real right now as someone thats not from either of those countries.When you hear of the US growing up you think of this amazing place with all these opportunities and how everything is  more extravagant than where we are. How the first thing you should do when you have money is visit a place like New York or Miami. All of these ideals we heard about only to grow up and see the USs slow but sure fall. Now Im not saying the US is going to tip over any time soon. Im saying youre nothing like the country you were  years ago. And with the way youre going now youll be nothing like the way you are now in  years. So yes. You should be compared on every single matter that comes to hand because without it youd never really realize how shitty life is becoming. You have so many issues that are always hovering around and sometimes when theyre compared to another country you dont pay that much attention to it. And when theyre really brought up its all just promises and never change. TLDR The US needs to fix its shit. ,PKA,cwh8cs5,1,t5_2u7e8

Of all the promises presidential candidates have made regarding govt this for me is the most dense of them all. ,PKA,cwsp7m8,-2,t5_2u7e8

For example the show had a whole different dynamic when wings and lefty were on than it does now and kyle showing his face allowed him to have a much more prominent role on the show which I think has made the show a lot better and funnier ,PKA,cww5tau,3,t5_2u7e8

As long as we arent directly harming or threatening the hosts doxxing death threats etc. all content that is critical of the hosts should be allowed. In the past weve had problems with the mods protecting the hosts and deleting posts that called out hosts or complained about them.

I cant think of a better combination of friends motivators fans resources and money that could come together to make someone lose weight than what Wings has experienced. Albeit the environment hes in is full of circumstances that enable him to keep on the weight but at this point theres nothing anyone can do for him.Anyone whos been a fan of Wings for a number of years like a large amount of us including myself have been has witnessed the Wings is going to lose the weight cycle time and time again.

6618701,0,t3_466xlr,Scheduling something like that with Woody and Murka having such hectic lives would be a nightmare. Chiz would literally DIE from drinking too much coffee after having the stress of organizing  guests. By Day  they will have straight up run outta shit to talk about. By day  Woody would have made so many slipups because hes stressed out about completing the challenge and now the fans hate him because hes just said that Bill Murray is the least funny man to ever walk the planet. Jackie starts a fight with him on the show telling Woody that hes neglecting his family in preference for his fans. Finally Jackie has enough of Woodys misogynistic comments about her camera work. She divorces him taking  of his money the kids and the house. Woody depressed moves in with Kyle. A restraining order is taken out preventing Woody from seeing his kids after multiple online posts are found claiming Woody is a pedo.  He gets super drunk after this and shoots himself at Kyles house. Kyle tries to cover up his friends death but misses a few details and the police find out. They think Kyle accidentally shot Woody and thats why he tried to cover it up. Any evidence to the contrary was destroyed by Kyles coverup attempt. Kyle is put on death row. Netflix hears this and uses the plot in the next installment of Making a Murder. Taylor as the last surviving member of the podcast is able to license the story having been inspired by the Fine Bros. He becomes a millionaire overnight. Unfortunately Wings has found something connecting Taylor to Woodys death. He blackmails Taylor into giving him  a month in cash. Taylor complies for  months having no choice but gets robbed after picking up the cash from the bank one time. He puts up a solid defense but gets shot by the robber in the struggle. Without the cash flow from Taylor Wings who had been living like a king is now in debt with the wrong people. He does his best to make it up to them but goes missing and is found dead in a dumpster several months later having been tortured and starved leading Wings to have lost  pounds. Happy ending!

6675897,0,t3_4720si,The PKA audience is pretty pro gun no real surprise right there. But I thought this was a very well made video and I particularly liked how much time was focused on the suicide issue because any time people bring up oh gun control pfft if criminals want to get a gun theyll get a gun and do their shooting Sure and Ill revisit that quote because its one of the stupidest arguments ever and the video is not saying that suicides are a cause of having guns theyre saying theres a direct correlation between the rate amp number of suicides in America and the number of guns amp ease of obtaining them in the USA.The video pointed out very clearly that suicide is usually a temporary feeling so while youre in that state of mind with a gun its easier and quicker to execute on the thought of ending your life also the success rate is much much higher. If you in your depressed state of mind had to go hang yourself during the process of setting all of that up you mind talk yourself out of it its less impulse associated. Ive said it before if Woody had access to a gun when he was  I think thats right then he more than likely wouldnt be here today. He tried to hang himself and failed thankfully but if he had a gun it would be pretty hard to fail in that state of mind.Now as far as gun control and the laws in place or wanting to be added. The argument Well criminals are just going to break them why add more laws to ME the normal citizen Lol fuck you. News flash a criminal is a CRIMINAL they break laws its what they do folks. Murder rape theft burglary pretty sure theyre all outlawed and CRIMINALS still do them the point of having laws in place is to deter the normal average citizens from acting out on any of this horrible things BECAUSE of the repercussions. A criminal doesnt give a fuck as clearly shown by repeat offenders but we all know how fearful many of us normal citizens are of going to jail BECAUSE of the laws in place against criminal acts and the repercussions associated with them.Take drunk driving people still do it to this day but the rates of drunk driving incidents and the deaths associated with them are much lower than  years ago.  Now we know people are still going to drink and drive does that mean lift all laws and regulations cause fuck it Im not a criminal. No every little bit helps dammit we live in an all or nothing state of mind with gun control. Oh that wont solve all of problem A that barely brings the death rate down but were talking about human lives here back to the drunk driving thing every little bit helps. And because of the rules and punishments laid out drunk driving is down and less people are dying because of it.Now to circle around to the Amendment issue because people love to bring up Its a fucking right. Okay oh by the way those felon criminals lose the right to legally bear arms under the nd Amendment anyway so even if that was the only thing we followed theyre still breaking the law. OH and felons lose the right to vote as well funny how the amazing God given rights that are so infallible can just be taken away from United States Citizens.... weird huh almost like theyre privileges like driving weird. Also funny how the st Amendment is so limited in practicality on the national airwaves as the FCC only answerable to the President have their own RULES amp REGULATIONS regarding matters of the st Amendment but whatever the rights are perfect and cannot be touched right? Malarkey.To just say Everyone is allowed to have a gun we dont care if you know how to use it whatsoever is just silly and one of the ass backward things about the United States the best st world nation around put it alongside the healthcare system. Swizterland did you know everyone there I believe once theyre legally adult is required to have a gun in their home for the men if I recall. In response to WWII since then the citizens of Swizterland men of age are all trained and knowledgeable in gun safety and use and have a gun in their homes. Theyre literally a nation with a populous prepared for a war. You cannot even give the gun up without jumping through legal red tape theyre required to have it. Id be cool if we fucking did that. Its ludicrous and I only hear silly arguments for why stuff like this is bad or wrong cause its not theres no proof its just. I draw a parallel between this and healthcare because sure Im not in the tax bracket that may be most affected by someone like Bernie Sanders but if I was I would still be on board. I think of the betterment of the people because the people are this nation the welfare of them makes us stronger if we join the st world nations in having a universal healthcare system and in relation to guns I things its silly were cool with preventable deaths. Automobile related deaths WAY WAY down from  years ago. Cars are safer than theyve ever been. Guns could be safer than theyve ever been with technology but no. Were cool with these mass shootings and the alarming suicide rate. A grip that is synced to your hand print so that only the gun operates when YOU are holding it and not someone else that sounds like it could prevent suicides nope SQUASH THAT SHIT.Anyway Im done. I thought the video was done really well and executed well on its message. Im not antigun Im antidead kids Seriously this isnt the O.K. Corral this is .

Now he is correct that Woody wont let it go whiteboy isnt trying to be friends with Woody he just wants the past to stay there.

The US is far less homogeneous than Sweden and although the US ranks among the middle for most homogeneous counties I would argue the US needs an asterisk because people embrace two sets of cultures here unlike other countries who technically rank higher in homogeneity. All in all I would say the US is one of the least homogeneous countries in the world. The US was founded as a nation for the little man. It was a home for those who had been in the minority whether ethnically religiously or socioeconomically and it rewarded those based on ability something alien to much of the world during this time. This way of thinking was thoroughly adopted by Americans across all sectors of society from the get go. It still makes up the dominant mindset in America. In todays world such principles appear to not yield the highest prosperity on the national level like they once did in the US. Nowadays Northern Europe leads the world in many elements of prosperity while operating under a thought system antithetical to the American one. Regarding your first point in  I would say that population undoubtedly plays a role in national welfare. If the US chooses to follow the Nordic example for a higher living standard they face the monumental task of reversing much of their history that is immeasurably ingrained in American society. With  million people this is much harder than it would be for a country of  million like Sweden does. ,PKA,d18f5h8,2,t5_2u7e8

Essentally lobbyists from groups that fund programs such as the  step program have been trying to block these pills from making it to market and doctors wont take it on because they view mental and physical illnesses differently when there is much evidence to suggest theyre basically the same and can be treated in similar ways. Recent research in the field suggests that addiction of any kind chemical or habitual is simply a result of an often involuntary change in brain chemistry that can be easily refrified by reversing the changes. So far in testing the drug is like  effective or something too. Many people now think that the  step program and other programs like it are outdated and ineffective. The vast majority of people relapse fairly shortly after the program and I think like  or  of the steps have a reference to God. Really were relying on God to solve our problems? Either way some of the research is very interesting and could potentially change the way we think about addiction.,PKA,d1mu44x,2,t5_2u7e8

Theres a halfdozen really good theories as to why American corporations firms and individuals have not been mentioned but there almost certainly coming soon. Theres a sub for the Panama Papers where they lay out the details. The papers actually mention more companies than people though we dont have them all by name or the details surrounding by them. In the U.K. alone there was over  companies listed in the leak for cooperating in corruption so its quite likely that the U.S. will exceed that. Also I dont think theres any chance at all that this could lead to a steep fall in the stock market let alone a crash. As far as we know and keep in mind only  of the  million documents have been released this leak has little to do with economics and more to do with exposing the corruption of the worlds most powerful people companies and firms that undermine law government democracy justice etc.,PKA,d1p2rr6,1,t5_2u7e8

If you had a supreme court that was strongly left wing they could nullify any national laws that were passed in the s. Weve seen this power recently used when the supreme court ordered the legalization of gay marriage.

7305515,0,t1_d28itit,TLDR Nade effect is real but OpTic is still boomingI agree with the Nadeshot effect one hundred percent Im a follower of Nade so I followed his team and everything on Twitter like another k did today. I dont completely agree with CoD dying though while the sales may not be as great the competitive side is growing more and more while they havent had many LANS this year the production value has greatly increased and viewership has risen so much since going back to twitch.  What I think is going to happen with this team is they are going to finish out season two and be invited to CoD Champs finish around th then disband. After that Nadeshot will be able to rebuild whatever roster he wants that isnt FaZe or OpTic. OpTic as a whole isnt as big as Nade but they are still doing extremely well they just introduced a drink for Pepsi and have a three month sponsorship with Turtle Wax they are still growing because of YouTube. Youre right about being the best CoD team and CSGO especially since they just went through a huge amount of drama I thought Hecz would have dropped them but they are still growing even their Halo team just improved greatly and brought in a new audience by bringing in Naded who is huge in the Halo community.

I would argue that elements of Wife Wednesday and your proposed Family Friday are already incorporated into the vlogs all the time if Jackie or another family member becomes involved the conversationinteraction happens naturally and I think thats best.In fact the only series I could see being mixed in would be a Mail Monday type segment where some messages or responded to or it could even be turned into a FanMailMonday type thing where emphasis is placed on physical letters and items sent in. Perhaps though Woody doesnt want to invite people to flood his messages any more than what he already receives.I sound like a douche upon rereading this but thats fine I always sound like a douche.

For your permit you have to pass a test that contains info about road signs and basic things you should pick up by just paying attention while being driven by your parents for . years. Once you do that you have to sign up for a class and take another test on the last day of the class there were  classes each about three hours. The class goes into some things that are common knowledge for drivers but what people who havent driven dont think about its easy though everyone in my class passed.Then you have to drive around for a couple of hours a couple of times with an instructor then youll be ready for the final driving test. Its been pretty good so far but the final test is bullshit. For part one of the test you do maneuverability around some cones and if you bump into a cone you instantly fail. For part two you drive around the BMVs local town while your instructor marks down points everytime you make a mistake if you get too many points you fail. Part one is fine but your score on part two is conpletely random depending on whoever is testing you. Some testers will mark you down for going one over in a parking lot while others wont pay attention and just talk about their day. Overall Its not too bad besides the luck of the draw on who tests you on the driving test. I know some people who passed who shouldnt have and I know some who didnt pass who shouldve. ,PKA,d6cc0zj,2,t5_2u7e8

Ive watched every single episode of PKA and so far as I can tell theyre still enjoying the show as much as ever.

10269199,0,t3_5n1rao,I dont think its quite as easy as we think it is to get quality guests. You have no way to know how an outsider is going to handle talking to  strangers who are good friends. Whenever theres a new guest like Steve Hostetter its sort of a shot in the dark whether theyll work out or not. But the guys who the long term fans know and love like Harley and Tucker are guaranteed to get a positive response. And currently I think the guys need some more positive feedback and less chastisement over their efforts. Maybe if the subreddit didnt start dropping turds on the hosts any time a guest or topic was a miss then theyd be more active and more inclined to listen. Criticism is good and is necessary but being a jerk and being negative out of childish entitlement is a bonafide way to get someone to ignore your input. Not saying OP is guilty of the latter but youre blind if you dont see the correlation. ,PKA,dc82j0u,6,t5_2u7e8

11077658,1,t1_dendmx8,Really good reply Chiz it explains alot but i feel like this should of been posted before this whole thread blew up. You cant keep your fan base in the dark if you posted this comment under diffrent circumstances the hardcore fans wouldnt have a feeling of frustration. Personally i want nothing but the best for you guys and the podcast its been a influence in my teenage years and young adult life but the subreddit being ignored by most of the hosts was not the right move to counter the trolls. Like i mentioned before there was alot of frustration being let out in this thread cant judge the fan base off of this one post. I get it i see the trolls in the subreddit as well but the majority of the people on here are the dedicated fans the ones that choose to go above and support the guys by being a Patron using the sponsor codes sharing the podcast and creating content based of the show. There has to be conversation path way between the hosts and the fanbase and not just for the patrons that are lcuky enough to spare an extra  dollars a month for the hangouts. Im pretty sure none of us want to see the podcast fail.,PKA,denn4ze,2,t5_2u7e8
