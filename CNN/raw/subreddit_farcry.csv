2234667,0,t1_clmh7du,I guess its been a while since I played FC been actively avoiding the desire so FC feels as fresh as possible! but were we able to link death from above takedowns into chain takedowns in ? I dont remember being able to so thats one thing new in the whole takedown aspect if so. Also its not a skill to move regular soldiers bodies only the heavies the other moving body skill is the ability to hold a sidearm while moving them. All in all there seem to be fewer skills in total. And some of them you have to put points into multiple times though thankfully theyre just the time durations on syringes not something super important or particularly useful  On the bright side though Im glad very few of these skills are locked behind story progression. A few of them are locked behind missions but it only looked like the health upgrades. A couple others locked by side mission content but we should be able to access most of these skills before progressing too far into the story if were spending alot of time in the openworld and leveling up.,farcry,clnvon6,1,t5_2st42

Otherwise you would get into all sorts of trouble with each player being at different stages.The only way I could see it working would be if it had a completely separate progression but you do have to start at some point.I feel like Coop was meant to be aimed at people that have both completed the game and want to do some open world roaming with mates.

To me its like FC on steroids and they kept the things that made FC good and added bits and pieces on to it that are great.Stuff like the Outpost master and the Arena makes it possible to play the same save game for a shit ton of time because you wont run out of missions so to say.All in all I really liked FC I will play it through again I know that but I will first try to get my current game to ,farcry,cmaccrx,1,t5_2st42

3047152,0,t3_2swrir,Buck was my favorite from FarCry .  Dont get me wrong Michael Mando did a nice job with Vaas but as has been stated axe  crazy psychopath has been done before and people just got so damn hyped up by him.  He was a good antagonist but not a terribly interesting one IMO.  Buck was interesting because he trod this line where you knew he wasnt a good guy but he wasnt really outright hostile to you.  Sort of a frenemy.  I honestly pictured him being a guy who youd have the choice of killing for what he did to Keith or sparing because he could help you take down Hoyt and Vaas.  Wouldve made it far more interesting I think.I liked Pagan too. He was eloquent sophisticated and crazy but usually in a more restrained way than Vaas or Hoyt.  Pagan had episodes it seemed. Or relied more on menace than violence.  He always carried himself in a calm jovial manner because he owned Kyrat.  No insecurity just complete confidence he could manipulate the people he needed to keep things under control.  Hell even when you storm his mansion hes completely business as usual as he lays out the state of affairs for you.Havent played FC yet so I cant comment on the Jackal.,farcry,codu4hp,1,t5_2st42

At the beginning Dennis keeps pushing Jason to let his instincts take over and combined with wanting to save his friends I get how it works. But in  it just doesnt make any sense. Also we barely know anything about Ajay. I love Vaas too you dont really see much of Pagan Min. Vaas insanity speech was amazing. I was really drawn in with that scene.

At that point he should be familiar with the game at a base level hell have hunted wolves taken a radio tower etc. Id say take him around and help him hunt so he can craft some pouches holsters. Also in coop you can actually swap out your good weapons and he can pick them up and unlock them earlier in the game that might help him out. Although it suppose it could be considered an exploit so on the off chance he has some misguided moral stance against it it may not be something youd want to do... hahaha.. but getting the better weapons earlier in the game can be quite fun!

Seeing how Primal takes place at the end of the Pleistocene in the Paleolithic era this is when we see Neanderthals beginning to vanish from the fossil record IIRC and be replaced by Homo sapiens sapiens. Im fairly certain the developers knew about this and tried to implement it into the game the Udam pretty clearly resembleact like Neanderthals and the Wenja look and act like modern day humans. We know Neanderthals lived around modern day Europe and also at this time period many Homo sapiens were migrating out of Africa and beyond the Great Rift Valley. Given these circumstances I believe it would be reasonable enough to conclude the Wenja were a Homo sapiens sapiens tribe that relatively recently migrated around got their shells from the Mediterranean? Trading was also speculated to have been a thing but given the Wenjas use of shells as like a symbol of their tribe I dont know how much theyd trade themobtain them from other tribes.I hope this helped! Archaeology is far from an exact science and its often very hard to piece things together about the past based on the kind of evidence typically recovered in excavations but if youre more interested Id suggest reading up on theories of early hominid migration during the Paleolithic.Edit And everyone said my degree wouldnt amount to anything!
