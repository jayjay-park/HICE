6413938,0,t3_43e98y,For what its worth my Activite is in agreement with my iPhone counting steps when walking. But for running its idea of distance is pretty far off  it thinks my  mile run is  miles. I dont know if the step count for running is correct but Google says a mile is about  steps and that is what the Activite says more or less.,withings,czip7bf,1,t5_2yz14

8057791,0,t1_d4lr3ku,It is a BIT on the small side the leather band is slim. But I love it and have not even entertained the thought that it might be too small. Unless you have a huge huge wrist andor are specifically a fan of large watches I dont think youll have a problem. Yes its slim but I like it. Totally suave. ,withings,d4lrspu,2,t5_2yz14

Your watch will then find the best moment to wake you up during that time period to make for a smoother wakeup experience.If it thinks youre in a light sleep itll wake you up earlier.,withings,de9xgc4,2,t5_2yz14
10976627,0,t3_5vm4ib,I wonder if they have fixed the issue with Syncing with MyFitnessPal? The Device would only report net calories adjusted for weight loss goals rather than gross calories that MFP expected. I really wanted to like it but this was a deal breaker. ,withings,dec6sas,2,t5_2yz14
