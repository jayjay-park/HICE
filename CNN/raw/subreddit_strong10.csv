3352455,0,t3_2yk7rf,Just gave this a listen and while im pretty new to the electronic scene in general and still trying to find my feet I did thoroughly enjoy it. Though with the density of the album I feel it will need many more listens as well as a look into his other projects to get a sense of what hes about. What I struggle with is finding a staple attribute that Aphex Twin coins as his own what would you say is his thing if one exists that causes him to be so influential upon the genre?,strong10,cpaekru,4,t5_378xi
