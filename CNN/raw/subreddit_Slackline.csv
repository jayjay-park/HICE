Girth hitched lines will experience a lot of wear when seriously tricklined on. If youre simply looking for smth to walk and bounce on youll be fine although Id recommend smth longer,Slackline,cg8fgpm,2,t5_2rbhm

We generally do whatever were comfortable with with the expectation that if we have to bail you either hook the line with your legs or take a leash fall. When starting out trying to catch the line with your hands is kinda dangerous.Good luck for the future!,Slackline,ci2isf6,3,t5_2rbhm

4687650,0,t3_3f2xap,Is that how the kit expects you to use it? Theres no need to use the loop end just make a line locker on the shackle preferably a bigger shackle with a bight of webbing and some aluminum steel preferred  rappel rings and a protective sleeve of in webbing.  Or use a weblock of some kind either from Balance Community or slackpro.de Until you get to try a real highline and then learn from some people who have already done it before the best advice is to just not even think about setting one up. When you are ready youll be having to buy more gear anyway so dont worry about making this set do something else it wasnt designed to do.  For your safety!,Slackline,ctlf7fn,2,t5_2rbhm

6900089,0,t1_d0xck6t,Luckily making X frames can be really easy. We make simple ones by using x studs a  diameter grade  bolt and a short piece of rope. All materials can be gotten at a Home Depot or similar hardware store.Determine how long you want the legs to be and get the appropriate lumber. Mock up the X on the ground before drilling the center hole for the bolt and cutting the legs to length. The bolt should be located a few inches below the top of the X frame so youre able to make a little crotch where the anchor can extend out through. We suggest not having the slackline run through the crotch but the anchoring material coming from the deadman anchor. Once the mock up is deemed good go head and cut the legs to length and drill your bolt hole. Youre then going to drill  hole a few inches from the bottom of each leg so that you can run the rope through and tie off. This rope is used to keep the legs from spreading further apart once in use. We recommend the angle at the lower crotch not exceed about  degrees. These are super simple and easy to build. Hope that helps!,Slackline,d0yfzdf,2,t5_2rbhm
7074106,0,t3_4cer39,It wouldnt end up saving you any money after getting the gear to build the primitive. The tubeline set is  and comes with  ft of webbing. Climb spec tubular webbing from REI is . cents per foot so  for  ft. Keep in mind you use part of that for the tensioning system but you could still easily rig  feet with that webbing. Id say just go for the primitive setup and buy  ft of webbing  for walking and  for the anchors. This will give you more room to grow than the Flowline or Tubeline and will prepare you much more for longlining or highlining if thats what youre planning on getting into. ,Slackline,d1i7ot5,2,t5_2rbhm
7197780,0,t3_4e1sju,So carabiners are nice because they are cost effective and fairly strong. However they fatigue extremely quickly and should be retired relatively quickly once you begin slacklining on them. Shackles are extremely strong and do not fatigue as fast especially on short lines However using them on beginner lines are hard. This is an example of a prebuilt primitive kit with shackles. The major problem that I see with this is that the captive pin on the shackle could become loosened as you slack on them or as you tension them. What you should do is get a cotter pin style shackle and always ensure that the cotter pin is in each one when you do that. Also shape of the shackle matters. In that kit the shackles are d Shackles. I would recommend going for bow shackles as they are a more versatile piece and can will be useful far longer than your beginner primitive webbing will be. That being said about shackles. Carabiners are very nice for primitives. This is an example of a prebuilt primitive kit which uses carabiners. What they lack in strength and longevity they make up for in versatility ease of use and weight. A primitive with shackles will take more time to set up maybe not after practicing but initially a lot more time. Aluminum carabiners also weigh much less than shackles and while may not be that important for park rigs where you walk ten feet can save your back if you are traveling and bringing this with you! In all both setups have their upsides and downsides. The main problem with carabiners is strength and longevity. The main problem with shackles is that they are fairly difficult to use  at least compared to carabiners. ,Slackline,d1wbuth,7,t5_2rbhm

8953726,0,t1_d7o03d9,gt Can you please give me some preferable methods for backing up the backup webbing?I take it you mean tying off the tails? There are a number of different techniques to achieve this but the most important aspect is that the tail tieoffs dont slide out of position and that the webbing or rope is protected from sharp or abrasive edges. Some Brits I know have been having good success with some variations on Muntermule hitches for their tail tieoffs. Im accustomed to using bowlines but they dont tend to keep in place very well which can lead to the tieoff sliding away from its intended position and edge protection.,Slackline,d7o3rhx,2,t5_2rbhm
9874914,0,t1_datvlnp,The surf line will give you everything to put up a line but all single ratchet setups dont really allow for expandablity. I heard a rumor SI is going to redo their website Jan  so it may be easier to understand what you need. Do you live in the states? I have all of my Spansets from Balance community. They sell shackles too. Any long line place sells spansets.  this also looks like a good bundle just look into a slow release. It saves your lines and ratchets. ,Slackline,dauq3ct,2,t5_2rbhm

Also important to remember you arent walking the line at first. Youre getting your balance then switching legs. Once you have both of those you can set your line with much more sway which is so much more fun.Edit at first its much easier to focus on one foot on the line at a time then switch feet. ,Slackline,dgn0aur,2,t5_2rbhm
