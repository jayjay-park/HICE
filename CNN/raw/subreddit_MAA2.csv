7082846,0,t3_4cjrws,At some point you will end up prioritizing the gold that you earn from daily tasks and the like. Once you get a viable man team and start leveling them up you may want to evaluate your priorities and stop buying superior cells at  gold a pop so that you can then use the gold for advancing your team instead. Such as energy refills scouting refills and scouting reward rerolls. Its personal preference some players detest rerolling rewards but speaking form my personal experiences ive rerolled scouting mission rewards many times to get the solitares that I need and in the  weeks ive been playing I already have  heroes at level  one is  two are  all their primary skills are at  and then another  characters are sitting at level  and s as well.for instance  gold for a superior cell or  rerolls on a scouting mission or  energy refills for chapter quests or  scouting mission refills and so on. Youre guaranteed to get about  gold per week if you play properly.  gold from daily tasks all week a good chance at getting more gold from daily PvP rewards and a decent chance at getting even more gold from chapter missions plus more.,MAA2,d1j7fua,1,t5_3b9s5

Tank could be Groot AoU Cap and maybe even Luke Cage.  I would only say Luke Cage if you get his move which gives Fortified.For PVP hate to tell you man but PVP isnt designed to be fair.  I was in S Rank after  days and my team was really good but I got  shot all the time by Rocket and Black Widow.  The funny thing is Black Widows with lower stats than mine did more damage in PVP all the time.So dont get discouraged we all feel that way all the time.

The direct counter to evasion is accuracy which only Daredevil has access to in a team of that type. In theory Luke would draw fire and tank it up Iron Fist would heal and heal and heal while Daredevil would do the hitting. But the Unstoppable ISO in particular emasculates it.For now you may need to consider alternatives to this team until the meta shifts again with the next round of buffs and debuffs of the currently weak and OP heroes.,MAA2,d2e2ez2,1,t5_3b9s5

I hope you guys dont mind Ive been borrowing information from here for my task list there for the Iron Man tasks I credited who I got information from.Captain America PathShield vs. SHIELD Defeat  SHIELD agents in Spec Ops .Taking Sides Defeat  Opposition heroes in Spec Ops . You cannot complete this one in one run of Mission . I recommend repeating Mission  to get the last opposition hero as it sets you up for the next two tasks. EDIT Apparently if you fight SheHulk and not Hank Pym you can do all four heroes in one run. Thanks to Sandmanjack and andy for the information.Outplanned Apply Tactical Debuffs four times to Winter Soldier in Spec Ops . Winter Soldier is the secondtolast battle in Mission . You should be just a few missions away from him if you repeated Mission  after the last task. This task is also not four different tactical buffs  I spammed Black Widows tactical a bunch of times to apply Wide Open. Tactical Debuffs include Wide Open Targeted Hindered Stumbling and Clobbered.Oh Captain! My Captain! Defeat Captain Marvel in Spec Ops  Mission . This one gives a Superior Power Cell! Captain Marvel is the boss of the Captain America version of Mission .Side Quest Complete  Deploys in Spec Ops . It appears at least at the point youll be encountering this task that theres only one deploy per Mission. Additional Deploys may open once more paths open up later. So the best way to do this seems to be doing the first two battles of Mission  and restarting until youve completed all three deploys.Sea Tiger Defeat Tiger Shark in Spec Ops  Mission . Choose the Hydra battle instead of the War Machine mini boss.Heart of Darkness Apply  Mental Debuffs to enemies in Wakanda mission . Mental Debuffs include Demoralized Distracted Susceptible and Intimidated. Rumble in the Jungle Use Blunt attacks against opposition heroes  times in Spec Ops .

I dont have IF above level  and really am more interested in investing in MODOK until he is maxed. Him plus Wasp seems like easy mode for PVE content which will be nice when it is time sensitive. I agree with wanting DPS and I think Electros stun will come in handy if the enemy has something that messes with shields. Also it seems Electros Static Charge plus MODOKs Confident pus Wasps Bioenergy Blast and AOE attack will be really strong and really fun.

My best advice is be sure to equip your heroes with impenetrable  less damage when above  health to significantly lower your chances of being oneshotted. Also its a good idea to equip alert to be able to attack her when she comes to battle veiled.Other than that try out new team combos that include either Moon Knight or Luke Cage who both have decent chances of killing her in one turn. Also CW Iron Man has great shields to lower her chances of one shots.Or quit and pick it back up in a month when shes been nerfed.,MAA2,d4eyvb6,2,t5_3b9s5

8334135,0,t3_4tq0gq,I can only speak about heroes I have experience with. I think your point is to get one from each class right?Worst Infiltrator should be AoU vision right? I havent played around with him too much yet to be honest. But I dont see myself being able to putting him in any specific team. His stun thing seems cool but nothing ground breaking. A close second for me at least would be vanilla black panther. For scrapper I have trouble building a strong Falcon. The thors and nebula can easily fit into a shock team. The thors have good survivability not great but usable. Falcon is just way too flimsy for my own liking without being able to bring much to the table. I get that he is supposed to be fast attacker just never been able to build a good one and not much synergy with others.For bruiser I am not sure what mr. hyde is for. I have trouble with Groot too but he is simple. Max his health and defense and absorb hits. Hyde is more nuanced and therefore harder to build. He is gathering dust in my collection. I want to return to him one day but as of now he is my least favourite bruiser.Tacticians are all pretty neat and fun to play with. If I were force to pick one from my roster I would say that vanilla captain america is the least useful out of all my tacticians. Even then he has a neat ability which grants haste to all when attacked. The problem with him is i havent bought many of his abilities yet. Maybe after some investment I would put agent  here. Last we have blasters. I am most disappointed with Winter Soldier. He doesnt seem to mesh well with my existing teams. I have heard that he is great but I have not been able to replicate the results. I have Hank Pym on the bench but I want to invest some time with him before dismissing him now that he isnt bugged anymore.

I have had some big win streaks. With only a few losses. Those losses I have had tho were pretty demoralizing as my team was utterly crushed into oblivion like they didnt exist. Basically the only teams who kill me are ones with Protection bypass. That just ohko iron fist and black widow. Some teams just have all attack isos slotted so they have way more than enough. Hitting me for like  damage. I go for speed and evasion on every character. Hope I can hit them fast and hard enough to take them out. Wasp on characters who dont have protection bypass is basically immortal and even if she is at type disadvantage and by herself she is unstoppable. My wasp has about k evasion and k speed. So I can take as many turns as needed until she eventually wins. She also has barricading impen indom. Only thing shes missing is rejuv.I will say of your characters iron man gives me prob the most trouble. With incendiary missiles it makes protecting worthless and usually finishes off my iron fist before he can heal the team. The few losses I have had have come from that. And Angelas who just instantly ko each character with ichor mastery.I think Iron Fist is my weakest link. He is incredibly powerful with iron fist. And the heal is super awesome. But far to often I find his first turn is simply using the party heal to heal only himself just so he can stay alive against protection bypass since he is utterly squishy and doesnt have the iso slot setup to get decent defensive stats.Have no idea how i used bold? but cool I guess.,MAA2,d5o8fhw,1,t5_3b9s5

It has only been two weeks since the end of PvP and just a few days longer since the . patch preview was posted. Maybe they are just trying to iron out the rest of the bugs. The known issue list on their forum was quite long and Im sure they could have a copy of it if they wanted to.Spell it out with meRELAXIts going to be ok.,MAA2,d6eaczr,5,t5_3b9s5

8653542,0,t3_4yf9iu,Hes more like a hybrid protector. Making full use of him will force you to go through his aspects meaning you cannot keep him as a protector at all times. If you insist though you can forego crescent dart and the watcher aspect and match his green ISO slots. He has  aspects and  of them will allow for free attacks on turn except defender. So without crescent dart from watcher aspect you will have  of  chances to get pathfinder aspect. ,MAA2,d6nb24r,0,t5_3b9s5
8668311,0,t1_d6oaftf,Hes definitely my goto hero when I really need to dish out ridiculous damage. Even against blaster epic bosses hes more worth having there than not.,MAA2,d6p5qkj,1,t5_3b9s5

8820083,0,t3_50z2w4,Well no point in taking the high road anymore...Zoque youre so right! How silly of us to spend time enjoying this game! We were so stupid to have fun building up our heroes. What were we thinking?We should have been doing something productive. Like finding random communities online and making idiotic arguments to try and get them riled up. Well follow your example and do better next time.,MAA2,d781xid,12,t5_3b9s5
8902205,0,t3_527c1k,This is the team I had before I deleted the game. As soon as I found out it was getting shut down I had to get rid of it too many memories and reminded me of what we were losing.,MAA2,d7hx0vx,1,t5_3b9s5
