1268610,0,t1_cibq7dg,Theres about two millennium of great thinkers that would disagree with you and the concept of universalism or subjectivity in this regard isnt internally consistent. Whether you like it or not it stands to reason that either on Church is correct and all others are wrong or all churches are wrong. Ill go ahead and stick with the one that Christ instituted. Because everything that you just said being consistent with itself is just another subjective view on it which is where it loses any sort of authority at all. ,CatholicMemes,cicc2tp,4,t5_2wfd9

You can read about it in this review from the Bad Webcomic Wiki.But anyways if I had to guess Id say that these edits were probably created by some anons on chans christian board.Edit My assumptions were correct Theyre giving it the Ben Garrison treatment.,CatholicMemes,cqzq633,1,t5_2wfd9

4440975,0,t3_3bwv3d,The government can no more force the Church to perform a gay marriage than it can force it to annul Holy Matrimony. Last time somebody tried that a.k.a. Henry VIII it didnt go over too well did it? No one is trying to force the Church to perform gay marriages the separation of church and state in the constitution actually protects the church from that. The conservative news outlets that are perpetuating this slippery slope rhetoric are so far removed from Catholic values or interests its disgusting please dont listen to them. They are hypocrites when it comes to the value of life abortion on one hand the death penalty on another and almost worse on social values preaching Christian values while demonizing any any social support for the poor or sick. Im honestly waiting for the Bishops to get together and tell the faithful to Turn that shit off. Its about time we did.,CatholicMemes,csqgwiz,9,t5_2wfd9
