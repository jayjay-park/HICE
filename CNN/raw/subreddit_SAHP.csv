1473532,0,t3_2azw5j,I havent become one yet but in telling people that I am going to become one the reactions are varied. Most think its good. They know I wont be sitting around all day doing nothingwatching TV. Ive gone to great lengths to explain how I needed to work on a schedule for household dutiesmeal creation and that Ill probably be somewhat of a hermit for most of the coming years.I havent been graced with anyone displaying completely negative reactions but some have been flat out mystified why Id leave my job over my wife leaving hers. Straight forward and obvious answer She makes   times the amount of money that I make.For years Ive chided my stepmother who became a SAHP when they adopted my stepsister because she complains about not having enough time in the day for all the stuff she wants to do. My stepsister is nearly a teenager now and yet my stepmother still complains about the lack of time. I honestly think she just doesnt know how to manage her time and foolishly signs the kid up to too many activities.Im hoping that I can avoid her mistakes and provide a basis for all my criticisms by doing it the rightbetter way.,SAHP,cj0zd68,-4,t5_2rsj9
1505138,0,t1_cj4cuer,Im with you! I was exactly like OP. Stayed home with my kids for  years and I started to hate it and then myself and then them. I got on celexa and suddenly I loved them and myself again. Im not saying its the perfect answer I also started going to a therapist once I realized how big my problem was. ,SAHP,cj4xy8d,1,t5_2rsj9

5172978,0,t3_3lsu5b,Be willing to be ok with how the day goes. Dont kick yourself over no getting it all done dont kick yourself if you dont get anything at all done.We had a ruleguideline. Is everyone alive? Generally safe? No one hauled away by the crazy police? Then its at least a C grade for the day.Its silly but i think it was genuinely helpful because you dont get down on yourself and youre better able to suck it up and hope you get the dishes done tomorrow. Otherwise i think i would have been much more depressed and overwhelmed. Actually We still have this rule even though our boys are   and  and now we both work full time. Were probably running a B to Bplus average these days but well take a C day every once in a while. ,SAHP,cv9j8gk,4,t5_2rsj9

7395148,0,t1_d2irsij,It was a small town and nearly everyone in that town went to my dads night club for entertainment. It wasnt difficult to figure out that there would be valuable items and on some occasions large sums of cash from the night club in our home. Even though it was unlikely that Dad would ever bring the cash takings home  that didnt stop people from breaking in to check if he had.At some point the feeling of being violated goes away. When you have no sanctuary in your home you stop the expectation of safety and privacy. ,SAHP,d2is2q1,2,t5_2rsj9
7397358,0,t1_d2j0i6e,So youre looking to protect yourself from a small risk  by exposing yourself and your family to the risk that your gun is  more likely to kill you or another member of your household. Do you also understand that if gun control is implemented  there is also little to no chance that your Intruder this crazed mysterious murdering psychopath who could be likely fought off with a baseball bat  is also unlikely to have a gun?   Murder is not the only type of unlawful killing. The frequency or rate of gun violence does not need to be overstated when incidents like Sandy Hook happen.  Have a look at gun violence rates in America compared to the rest of the world.  You know whats better than a couple of mass shootings?  none.  This isnt about overstating or media hype. There is a factual basis to the information and that actual basis was children getting shot at school.. Im in Australia I dont hear the media hype about gun violence in America we dont have rolling coverage of incidents that happened in America. News covers Australian news believe it or not America is not the centre of everybody elses world. Or perhaps this is part of the grandiose paranoia that somebody is going to come round and shoot you in your house and the rest of the world really cares about your news because we have nothing else going on. We get the highlights at the end in the world news section. A simple statement of facts of what has happened in other countries. The comparison to the dangers of Australian fauna is foolish. The basis for the fear of Australian fauna is based on shows like The Crocodile Hunter. Not a simple statement of fact about an incident. It could be just me but  I like sending my kids to school and knowing that my biggest concern is that the teacher might not remind my kid to put a jumper on when he gets cold.  I like going to the movies and not worrying that someone will walk in and shoot me. I enjoyed my time at university at no point did I look over my shoulder wondering if somebody had ordered a gun online for .  I like that an assault rifle in Australia on the black market will cost you approximately ... and there arent too many mentally ill people capable of dropping that amount of coin and not many banks will finance that. I live in a tourist destination  so we have large events and heavily populated public areas... I can visit any one of these and not worry about gun violence. Because the statistical likelihood of me being subjected to gun violence in Australia doesnt need to play into my concerns for the day. The fact that youre citizens cant go see Batman and not get killed  or that you are complacent that children were killed at school... and think but that is an overstatement of gun violence.This isnt about you and your right to own a gun  this is about protecting vulnerable people. Some people I really great at driving cars at high speeds  but not everyone is so we have traffic law. Some people do hallucinogenic drugs and look at lava lamps. Other peoples do hallucinogenic drugs and murder their families. Not every law is tailored to you in your life.  But the law is there to protect people. Sure you get to keep your gun safely locked away in a safe. What about the other parents whos house your kid may visit  who dont keep their guns safely stowed away? What about the person whose house gets robbed and their gun gets stolen and falls into hands as somebody who should definitely not have a gun.  Of course gun control is a very personal issue. The person holding the gun who wants to keep their guns is pointing it at other people. So this isnt about  if you dont like guns dont own one. Your population largely considered arming teachers at one point. So even if I dont like guns  my family and friends who live in America are now in a situation where theyre sending their kids to school with armed educators?! And you see nothing wrong with this?! Its kind of like vaccinations  everyone has the right to not be vaccinated  that doesnt make it a good idea to not vaccinate because it impacts other people around you.  ,SAHP,d2j14jo,2,t5_2rsj9

9460960,0,t3_5aakul,I recently had a friend put me in for a super cushy position making more money than Id fantasized about making for at least a decade and Im trying so hard to figure out what the right decision is.  My husband and I always joked about being so broke our decision for me to stay at home was made for us but now that there is real money on the table we actually have to choose.  Looking for nannies to replace me is one of the worst things Ive ever done.  I wont see my kids for more than  hours a day.  The job is a dream job and strangely enough I would be a contractor for the company my husband works for now we both started out working at the same company he left and now it looks like I may follow him even though were in completely different fields but its really hard to say Yeah all this is great for me professionally and financially and even though its not best for my kids Im going to do it anyway.  I find out this week whether I get the job or not so its in someone elses hands now.,SAHP,d9f8s7h,5,t5_2rsj9
