9186221,0,t3_563l3t,I am a Cowboys fan. I like Dak a lot. Go with Matt Ryan. The Cowboys want to run the ball. Thats their number one goal. And while Daks ball security  and his ability to pick up a few yards on the run gives him a high floor hes never gonna pick up  yards in the air with multiple TDs. Matt Ryan just torched the Panthers defense. Despite Denver having a much better D expect Ryan to still put up a multiTD day.  ,fantasyfootballWDIS,d8gf5em,2,t5_2yhqe
9191999,0,t1_d8gzx2j,Im not sure those stats really mean much. Each defense has played four games so if all teams threw the same amount of yards then each team would account for  of the total yardage allowed. By those stats ATL only accounts for  more yardage against the Bucs and Saints than the average team and only  more yardage against the Raiders. Only the Panthers represent a significant difference and that was a freak game. Denver has already proven that they can stop good QBs. Its totally possible for Matt Ryan to have a good game but its also very possible that the defense will stuff him. For that reason Id take the relative safety of Dalton. ,fantasyfootballWDIS,d8h5j1i,1,t5_2yhqe
