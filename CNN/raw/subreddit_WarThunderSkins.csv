Putting a flag like the CSA flag on anything is just a case of racist bigots that dont want to understand the truth behind the design of that flag. But Im sure ur intentions werent like that.

Click the magic wand button to create a template folder in your UserSkins folder.  Move the skin files you downloaded into the template folder you just created.  Rename the skin files you downloaded to match the file names of the plane. Youll have to delete these files.  Play. ,WarThunderSkins,ch99yal,1,t5_31d55
