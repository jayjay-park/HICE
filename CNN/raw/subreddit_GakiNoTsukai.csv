2776708,0,t1_cnhc2i0,I second all that. The translation part is not as easy as just listening to what the person says and typing it into Word. It has to be translated carefully so that it doesnt sound excessively odd to Englishspeakers ears then entered into a subtitling program using the right formatting for the speaker. If youve ever tried your hand at transcribing ie listening to a speech in your native language and typing it up in Word or whatever its not something most people can do very quickly. Even very good transcribers have to listen to the speech several times to make certain its accurate.And translation is just one facet of the subbing process as victoryforZIM points out. Timing alone can take hours for just a short segment as the timer has to listen to a section of spoken word and mark the beginning and ending segments of each speech precisely. Someone has to set all the colours and position of text correctly. Another person has to make sure its all consistent errorfree and flows correctly.Others in the thread have pointed out that its also not really anybodys fulltime job. Those working on the subs love Gaki but also have to go to school work a regular job spend time with family have yearround hobbies etc. They volunteer their time when they can to make the subbing happen.Im sure everybody who works on subbing the GNT New Years show wants to see it complete and subbed as soon as possible but they also want to see it done right and dont want to exhaust themselves over it.,GakiNoTsukai,cnjpa7n,2,t5_2uh06

2888024,0,t3_2t1pd6,By your standards I would be sacked as a translator.Each person has a certain role on the team and theres a handful who juggle multiple roles. Rich is one of those. Have some sympathy please its not like the only thing on our agenda each day is to typeset and translate for no compensation other than kindness and gratitude. Donations do not go into our pockets it goes towards paying for the web hosting where you can download all the videos. It surprises me that theres a handful of fans out there who seem to have no concept of how other people have to spend their time. Even when I have free time to spare to spend on translating I want to go hang out with friends go out of town play video games etc. I mean do you spend all of your free time on volunteering?I understand youre impatient but when theres rent to pay classes to go to deadlines to meet the last thought on my mind is Oh no Im falling behind on subbing the batsu game.Also Rich is the one who even built that status website and is hosting all of Team Gakis web content. Plus more people to even contribute a little puts pressure off of the rest of us. Maybe you didnt mean to come off as rude but this was pretty unnecessary. Fortunately most of us dont care about the negative unhelpful feedback and keep going but when a group is doing you and the community a favor Id recommend being more sympathetic and empathic.Edit Also there arent very many subbers for Gaki.

2961695,0,t1_co4pfna,Theyre definitely repped well thats for sure.  But I also think its because their talents are more marketable and well adaptable for a more widespread audience.  I think the reason theyre not called comedians but  or  is because they are able to do a number of various things like TV shows variety comedic acts etc.Not taking away anything from western comedians because I love them too but it just feels like the personalities you see in Japan are capable of doing more than just comedy.  Notice the people in America who are comediansturnedcelebrity  Louis CK Seinfeld Chris Rock Eddie Murphy Richard Prior.  I can go on and on but each of these guys brought something more than standup to the table.  They could write.  They could act.  They could do something other than just comedy.  I think Japanese comedians are more performers than comedians which lends them to being able to turn the tables on other celebrities and gain as much notoriety.,GakiNoTsukai,co4rcg2,1,t5_2uh06

5372771,0,t1_cvy9cw0,gt Dont forgot the best batsu games happened when one of the two were there adding a personal feeling to the punishments.Its all subjective really and I know a number of people also have that opinion but Earth Defense did see the highest ratings in Japan. Personally I like it better when theyre all involved because you dont get to see as much of the winners who were allowed to arrive late and take a backseat for the majority. I dont particularly have a favorite though I just like moments from each.The future is unknown though so it could happen. In the meantime I think itd be quite possible for them to have segments where they take responsibility for what happens to the others. Theres been moments like that in the recent batsus such as intentionally using the wrong keys to make Matsumoto suffer.From what Housei said in an interview once Matsumotos original idea for the batsu didnt particularly revolve around the betting winnerloser mechanic it was more about getting entertainers from all walks of life together not just comedians to make everyone laugh including themselves. gt It was always the case that in all variety shows the comedians amused people but in the Do Not Laugh series the tables turned and it was not just them but people from all different categories of entertainment appearing even to make the comedians themselves laugh! Thats Downtowns amazing invention. Hsei raves on the innovativeness of the project then remembering the initial planning further Many years ago back then Matsumotosan muttered it and it was eyeopening for everyone who was there in an instant the change to the typical balance was born.From our perspective the celebrities trying to make them laugh are likely boring as we dont really know who they are but Matsumoto is pretty thrilled when they get a big celeb in the top seat of the batsu he can barely believe they are there on a variety show. Im more interested in the Gaki cast but I guess I can understand because back when Johnny Depp appeared on British comedy show The Vicar of Dibley for Comic Relief it was a funny surprise.,GakiNoTsukai,cvyfkaf,3,t5_2uh06

8592118,0,t1_d6fkaix,On that page you linked you can see that vk links have a special instruction beside it. That is to bypass that blocked error.So basically . click the link. . Let it open to the blocked page. . Mouse click the address bar as if youre gonna type a new URL.. Hit Entergo.. Watch video The reason why theres that error is because were using work around links. Kinda like tricking the VK servers in a sense. If we dont use them then youd need an account to watch Vk videos. But while this method is usable it is admittedly inconvenient so Im currently trying to figure out a better method of linking VK videos. ,GakiNoTsukai,d6flst8,5,t5_2uh06
8620004,0,t3_4xwj9z,Well at least you want to see Matsumotos muscular ass all day long I dont think that is going to exist.Though they did show their ass marks a few times in the batsus mainly Hosei when he is not wearing any pants. Also in the Onsen Batsu those were harder batsus too. I can recall that they showed their asses in the Spy batsu and I am not sure but for me there was no mark of the hits after all those things are probably just foam.I also think that for Hamada and Matsumoto to show their ass in front of their juniors nowadays would be a nono.edit spelling,GakiNoTsukai,d6j3n5h,9,t5_2uh06

10587386,0,t3_5rhww6,The two other posts here covered it very well if you deplete the resources they mentioned I would also check out Matsumotos Suberanai Hanashi. I think it translates to something like Guaranteed Funny Stories its a tv show where Matsumoto is joined by other comedians and they take turns telling real stories that have to make the other members laugh. I would definitely get a little acquainted with Japanese comedy a bit before watching to get the best out of it. Speaking some Japanese doesnt hurt either.  ,GakiNoTsukai,dd80acq,3,t5_2uh06
