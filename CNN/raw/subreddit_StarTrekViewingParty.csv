3465890,0,t3_2zwm8v,I think its great we can have an episode that takes place in about  rooms and still garner as much interest as this one does.  I love the subtle and not so subtle hint to slavery here Star Trek is notorious for taking our murky past and plastering in th century story lines.  Picard always seems to shine as an arbiter or representative in these court room scenarios.  I get a bit pissed off when people feel the need to refer to Data as It which is what the writers were going for I would assume.  But he is obviously a man built to conform to the appearances of a male.  Refer to him as HIM for godsakes!  Also correct me if I am wrong but this is the first time we see the Poker Table?  Funny that Pulaski was one of the first people to sit around the table!,StarTrekViewingParty,cpnc49d,6,t5_358gg

3914841,0,t1_cr2giek,gt Funny how all Rikers memories have a thirdperson perspectiveNow heres a cool idea!  What if we saw the memories from Rikers point of view instead of from the factual point of view.  I know this does absolutely not work because itd be super expensive but were already going back in time to the s to rewrite a TV show so why not let a little fantasy in!Lets say everything was reshot with all of Rikers personal bias and foggy fillintheblanks memories inherent with human memory?  Why not make Tashas death and the abduction by Armus WAY more horrifying because of Rikers emotions?  Why not fog up the details from The Naked Now due to Rikers inebriation although the guy could freakin handle it?  Thatd be one expensive and one awesome episode!,StarTrekViewingParty,cr2iznl,3,t5_358gg
3980701,0,t1_cra0626,Hehe no youre not the only one. When this originally aired I dont think we could have been more excited. The new opening floored us the new uniforms were so just what we had wanted I seem to remember just loving those new collars and the show had really taken on high production value.I stuck by the show since season one even though I didnt particularly think it was very good at the start. Season  had really redeemed it and by  it was a show I was willing to show to nontrek fans. I wasnt during season  to be frank.The nanites did share some thematic elements with the Home Soil creatures but the concept of nanites was still really new to a lot of people so it was an exciting story concept.Doctor Crushers return felt like fan victory it was so good to see her return. While they glossed over that return to a degree I was glad a few episodes later when she mentioned Pulaski and her memorywiping techniques. One thing TOS had always lacked was a continuity between the episodes. Many TOS fans preTNG often complained why would he say he had never encountered such a thing when they did  episodes earlier!? TNG had a habit of making callbacks to previous episodes and we really enjoyed that. As I said in a previous post here Diana Muldaur was also on another hit show of the time L.A. Law and her character died on that show when she walked into an elevator only for there to be no car and she plummeted to her death down the elevator shaft. I always mused that Kate dropped down the turbotube pThis episode however was not in itself a fan favorite nor was the character of Stubbs. There was also a powerful and unpleasant hatred of anything Wesley back then among the fans which I neither shared nor appreciated so you can imagine the reception was somewhat cool. But the increased production values and new uniforms had made everyone so keen to see more it didnt do anything to impede the growing TNG fever that would sweep the country by the end of season .As for gamma radiation? Dont worry it will be replaced with ubiquitous technojargon about tachyons soon enough. ,StarTrekViewingParty,cra178v,6,t5_358gg

5195394,0,t3_3m4u0z,This one just warms my heart. I remember staying up late pm with my little brother every night in the summer to watch reruns of TNG. This was probably around . He would always fall asleep and Id stay up well after the show ended just thinking about whatever idea was blowing my  year old mind.Then this episode hit. There was no great danger. No fabulous new scifi idea. It was mostly a sliceoflife genre painting. All this time I thought I was watching the show for the space ships lasers and concepts. But this episode showed teenage me that I had grown attached to the characters as my peers had grown attached to characters from Friends or Party of Five or whatever other teens were watching in the mid s.

7803866,0,t3_4m77jh,This episode is mainly carried by two fantastic guest stars Tony Todd as Worfs arrogant sarcastic brother and Charles Cooper as the weary corrupt Klingon chancellor Kmpec kind of like a more indepth version of his Klingon character in Star Trek V. Kmpec in particular is a very memorable character  despite his corruption and ineptitude it is clear that he is truly doing his best to hold his country together the only way he can think of and with all the cunning that he can muster. His brief reprise of the role in Reunion is also very poignant and gives dignity to an alien race that Ronald D. Moore was already turning into a medieval caricature.If it werent for that I think the episode would have been much weaker. It feels like two different stories spliced together which actually works OK since the audience doesnt see the second part coming but still makes the second part seem a bit underdeveloped. The intrigue on the Klingon homeworld is pretty hackily written requiring Picard to get into a brawl for the purpose of a plot point. Watching this backtoback with Reunion I think the latter episode is much betterplotted and betterwritten.,StarTrekViewingParty,d3t7s0d,3,t5_358gg

7979549,0,t3_4odtkp,I dont like this one. The debates both on and off the planet are simplistic and repetitive. An unreasonably bullheaded superspecies isnt as interesting in practice as it might have been on paper especially when they can be overcome with a legalese loophole. The Sheliac are like a dollar store Borg whose only weakness is contract negotiations. Zzzzz. Planetside we have a generic group with very little specificity to define them mention that aqueduct one more time and I swear Ill.... Theyre also unreasonable. How exactly did they intend to fight against orbital bombardment? They have no legal grounds to remain and unlike the later Maquis they have no practical means to stand their ground. Datas little demonstration at the end should have been his opening statement. Good looking effect though.So then we have a girlish roboticist and some kind of lesson for Data to learn about making appeals to emotion. The thing is theres no set up for it. Hes never had trouble appealing to someones sense of selfpreservation. And his final demonstration only reinforces his initial logical argument that they cant win. So its not much of a human lesson in the end or much of anything.  The whole story seems like a lot of halfbaked ideas rushed out the door. But that said the ideas raised do get picked up again by later stronger episodes in the same way Time Squared broke ground for Cause and Effect.,StarTrekViewingParty,d4cz5nd,3,t5_358gg
8039653,0,t3_4pc00z,Absolutely brilliant in every way. Bringing back Sito was very clever  in The First Duty she seemed unsure of herself and vulnerable to outside influence this characterization is also repeated here with her initial inability to stand up to Picard so giving her this mission here truly redeems her and gives her a huge moral victory arguably made even greater by the missions failure. Makes you wonder how many of these runofthemill officers who probably dont look that great on paper end up giving their lives in obscurity for some mission or other.Its nice to see Alyssa in the group of junior officers  with her and Sito it doesnt feel completely like a bunch of randos. MiniRiker is quite entertaining in his ineptitude as well. And theres a truly great Worf moment at the end Worf as the lowestranked of the senior staff may identify with these guys more.Sometimes one may wonder why we only see the bridge crew in the away missions along with the occasional Ensign Ricky but maybe those missions require extensive additional training that the junior officers just do not receive. That is theyre intended to be cogs in the machine that help the ship run smoothly and only the bridge crew possibly with the addition of some of the highestperforming junior officers are intended to handle the difficult stuff. At least this group is clearly not ready for any serious action which makes their frustration more relatable.,StarTrekViewingParty,d4jqdi0,11,t5_358gg
8278835,0,t3_4ste9s,If theyd wanted the Ferengi to be a serious yankeetrader villain type this shouldve been the first Ferengi episode instead of the Last Outpost wreck. This salesman is exactly the archetype that would work in that role. Hes clearly threatening to kill his potential clients friends but straightup doesnt acknowledge it and acts nothing but jovial and helpful to Picard and Crushers faces. Hes not evil but hes greedy sociopathic dishonest and comes across as very sinister and threatening. Obviously this ones a weak AI but fleshandblood people with the same demeanour and M.O. would fit the original role that was intended for Ferengi far better than the jumping around like angry gerbils thing they went with.,StarTrekViewingParty,d5cevtx,7,t5_358gg

8470591,0,t3_4vjflg,Absolutely TOS has great material. I would like to highlight The Enterprise Incident and Requiem for Methuselah which are both fantastic but come from S which is widely viewed as being subpar. I even like Let That Be Your Last Battlefield which is preachy but reasonably wellexecuted. To me S was actually weaker since it had more gimmicky planetsoftheweek like the Nazi planet the gangster planet a hilariously entertaining episode though the Roman planet and of course The Gamesters of Triskelion. Admittedly Journey to Babel and The Ultimate Computer are classics though.TOS at its best is really soulful and melancholy like in ...Methuselah or City on the Edge of Forever.

8696545,0,t1_d6sfcx4,My biggest issue with the Prime Directive is that no show or movie has dealt with it properly.It seems to me that a policy of noninterference means you dont have science teams living on a planet in disguise to study a Bronze Age protoVulcan society.  Then they have to be rescued when their holoshield goes kaput.It means you classify the planet as offlimits to all Federation vessels and leave a passive monitoring probe on the edge of the system. An extension of this could be that the Federation is now bound by its own philosophy to ensure no one else interferes with the planets natural development.  Make the planet offlimits to everyone and protect it from say the Klingons swooping in and setting up shop.  ,StarTrekViewingParty,d6sp6e3,7,t5_358gg

9691703,0,t3_5c3ka5,Im almost caught up!Necessary Evil is a great episode. Love Odos narration which is part film noir detective and part disdain for Starfleet protocol like a metacommentary on the captains log convention. This episode seems to be the genesis of pairing Odo with oldfashioned detective stories. Its great to see a look at the station under Cardassian rule. I really like the muted colors of the flashback sequences. All the references to the Cardassian Neck Trick make me wish we could see it!Odos commentary on humanitys need to keep extensive records on everything necessitating insane amounts of storage is quite funny satire. But the real heart of the episode and something I glossed over on earlier viewings is that the basis of Odo and Kiras relationship is a lie. Season  really starts to build the connection between the two and to learn here that all those years ago the first time he met her and showed her mercy was him being sloppy thats amazing. And all these years he never thought twice about it and now he learns his friend did something horrible. The development of Rom continues here. He had seemed to regress a little bit in the previous episode but the Rom we will come to know both devious and stupid at once is strongly defined in this episode. I love the scene where he tries to recall the name. Chesso! Though it is curious for Sisko to be so insistent that Rom wouldnt try to kill his own brother. That would be convincing if Rom hadnt actually tried to kill Quark in The Nagus just last year. But this is the new and improved Rom who would never.This is the kind of episode DS does well a study of moral ambiguities and interactions among different species with varying ethical codes. Odo is a great vehicle for this sort of story. And its nice that Gul Dukat is the one who makes him a security officer!,StarTrekViewingParty,da7phx1,1,t5_358gg
