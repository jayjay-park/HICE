They have these fan vote things to put someone on all the copies of the game... but why wouldnt they do some kind of added thing where people can maybe pay an extra  or  online and get a custom printed cover of their choice with their players on the cover?Chances are a lot of people wont care and just go buy the game from stores anyway but there would also be a pretty hefty amount of people who would want their favorite player on the cover instead and pay a tiny bit more to get it.I know I would. Varly on one side and Little Mac on the other? Mandeskog amp Dutchy on a second cover? Id be in fucking Avs cover heaven.

If its so humiliating then maybe he should try being more reasonable in negotiations. Sakic obviously had a hint this was going to go sideways again and thats why he elected for arbitration.I have a hard time being mad at his agency anymore too. Newport also represents Iginla and by all accounts those negotiations were extremely easy because Iginla wanted to be here.

Any Chicago game is gonna have tix sell more quickly since theres a major transplant of their fans here.  Avs Twitter account normally lets fans know about ticket stuff as well as Avalanche emails.

3069859,0,t3_2vbm2u,I put the primary blame on the offense right now. Yes the defense makes some terrible turnovers at times but its all on the offense in the attacking zone to get the puck into the net. They just arent pressuring the net  the only one that seems to do this is McLeod. And the coaching staff shouldnt be blamed as harshly as is being offered here. Roy has said time and again that hes telling his players to keep it simple and shoot the puck that goals dont always have to be pretty. Yet the offense is not heeding his words. Does that make it the coachs fault or the players? If the players were doing as he requested and they were still in this same predicament then yes it would be a fault on the coaching. But you cant even point a finger at coaching if the players arent even reflecting whats being said.If you want my honest harsh opinion... strip Landeskog of his C Sacco was the one who gave it to him remember that and have someone earn it going into next season.Foreseeable argument about SOG differentials being a sign of poor defensive play I counter that argument. I think the SOG differential is due to poor puck possession in the attacking zone. How many times do we see a once and done attack just to see the puck come back into the defensive zone for another  minutes? We need better offensive passing  and Im not talking about cycling the puck around the boards waiting for the perfect shot. Ive seen soooo many fails at rebound attempts and centering passes that dont connect. Lets work on that drive those kind of plays into the players and this offense will begin thriving again.,ColoradoAvalanche,cog6rcu,12,t5_2rqi4

The Avs fans trying to countertroll  taking the bait really need to stop  It looks bad and you should feel bad. Now that weve covered the basics Id like to invite every circlejerking hatebaiting downvotebrigading Wild fan who seems to have taken over rhockey over the past  hour to jump up so far up their own ass that it forms some kind of ass singularity thus erasing their miserable existence from this and all parallel universes. Stop acting like telling us shit we already know about our team counts as a sick burn  Pointing out the same shortcomings that Avs fans have been talking about ALL MOTHERFUCKING SEASON doesnt call for a shots fired. We fucking know. Weve been watching this team way longer than you have. Youre goddamn right Im salty right now. McLeod and Landeskog were both obviously in the wrong but to hear the Wild fans of rhockey tell it youd think our entire team pulled shivs out of their skates and started going for the kidneys. And its impossible to have any kind of reasonable conversation about what happened because any post with an Avs flair next to it is immediately voted below threshold. Fuck all yall inside out. rant.

He was partially responsible for all three goals pulling from the MHH recap because Im cranky and lazy Goal  gt Just like this weekend in Anaheim Brad Stuart found himself chasing the odd man rush after a bad pinch.  The Flames would not be denied on their second on of the period and Lance Bouma passed across to former Avs winger David Jones who beat Varlamov with a wrister.Goal  gt On an offensive zone faceoff the Flames won the puck back to their left side point and Dennis Wideman fired a floating wrist shot on net.  The puck deflected off Jiri Hudler and through a Nick Holden screen to beat Semyon Varlamov who never saw the puck and give the Flames a  lead with  seconds left.  No need to adjust monitor on the replay below the pixels representing Brad Stuart are not frozen he just chose not to move in any direction during the goal against.Goal gt The Flames cycled the puck high to T.J. Brodie who ripped a slapshot on net.  Lance Bouma deflected the puck past Varlamov in front.   Flames.   On the play Avalanche expert creaseclearer Brad Stuart stopped skating with his man when he went into the Avalanche crease then watched stationary as he tipped the puck past Varlamov.I guess you could argue that  was a weird deflection that was headed in no matter what but goddamn man  do something.Between tonights game and the blown OT play against Anaheim his play is approaching comically awful territory. ,ColoradoAvalanche,cpospng,16,t5_2rqi4

4361549,0,t1_csh9r3a,In  I was higher on Beau Bennett Charlie Coyle and Evgeny Kuznetsov. Kuz was the one I wanted the most and he want last out of those I believe. All of those guys were on the board when we picked. They already knew Hishon was very undersized going into that draft.The Seimens pick wasnt as bad I personally thought that draft was pretty weak from a depth perspective. I wanted them to pick J.T. Miller.And not having a first round pick has nothing to do with the  draft being so bad. Its the same reason why I actually loved the  draft take Mack out of the picture They nailed it with Bigras in the second and Butcher was a steal in the th IMO. Storm was also picked in that draft I believe as well. They got great value in the later rounds with those picks. Other than  and  though there later picks have been pretty bad. ,ColoradoAvalanche,csha420,2,t5_2rqi4

4804158,0,t3_3goiec,My first advice is to familiarize yourself with what season ticket holders are paying for those seats as they will almost always be the type of person you are buying your seats from. On a night that isnt against a hot rival or other popular team you can expect to find seats at or around the season ticket price for the seat. If you wait til the day of or even just a couple hours before the prices begin to drop. But take it from me club level is the best view in the house. Ive sat on row  before and the view was honestly pretty bad when it came to watching the other end of the ice. You only get to see half of the game depending on where you sit. ,ColoradoAvalanche,cu03r9x,6,t5_2rqi4

Captains get traded all the time off the top of my head Richards in Philly Clark in Washington Rivet as captain in Buffalo was waived and reassigned to the minors Pominville and Vanek in Buffalo were both traded as captains Rick Nash in Columbus Jarome Iginla in Calgary going way back but Shanahan in Hartford Lecavalier was bought out as captain and St. Louis was traded as captain for Callahan who was also captain at the time. Adrian Aucoin was the captain in Chicago when he was traded. Anyway I just dont buy the narrative. Unless youre a firmly established face of the franchise I dont think the likelihood of a captain being traded is all that diminished compared to an average roster player.,ColoradoAvalanche,cxyqrrk,1,t5_2rqi4

6522216,0,t1_cztwxw7,Just because they are career AHLers doesnt mean they wont get contacts. They most likely will because you need players in your affiliate for depth purposes putting decent players around the guys you are trying to develop. I would think a lot of the career AHLers you listed will get two way contacts but not all of them as the Avs want to shed contacts for max contract purposes.Also there is almost no way that Hishon Siemens etc. wont get contacts. Those guys are still young and can still develop. Just because they dont live up to their potential in no way means they arent valuable. Hishon is a good AHL guy and like I said above helps guys develop. He is playing well with Rantanen and Everberg.That being said everything else you said I agree with. I really hope Tangs doesnt get a contract. I will always love him and what he did for the Avs but he has no business making over M or anywhere near that,ColoradoAvalanche,czty5v5,10,t5_2rqi4

They dont believe me though.Except never do teams get that excited for a goal scored to make the game  in the opposing teams favor with less than  minutes to go in regulation. Thats not indicative of an organizational problem thats just hockey. Teams very rarely come back in those circumstances and players and staff dont usually make a big deal about getting one when youre down like that.Its pretty clear that Duchene was excited for a personal goal despite the PR work of the team on the front of the jersey mattering more than the name on the back.,ColoradoAvalanche,d1po6kl,2,t5_2rqi4

Our Forwards need to get the puck moving and stop showboating with the damn thing. We have the speed to make the opposing D really work but we need to get it into their zone and really create opportunities. While I follow the Avs religiously I also watch the Flyers Fiances team. Both teams love the dump and chase methodology and it is simply not working. If were going to keep pulling that trash we need to make sure we have the support coming in from the other wing or center. We also need to really stop relying heavily on our goaltenders. Varly and Pickard can only do so much.

Im pretty comfortable saying hell at the very least be an NHLer. And actually it wasnt just Greer that year we traded our nd st for the th pick in  and the th pick in . So its Greer and Cam Morrison. Both appear like have the potential to be impact NHLers if everything goes right.But again its way way too early to tell how well we benefited from the ROR trade.

Doesnt sound like the Avs are shopping him but theyre listening to offers on everyone. O they absolutely would but theres no way Sakic makes a deal with them unless Sergachev is involved. And the Habs may get desperate here pretty soon unless things turn around quickly for them. They need scoring in a bad way and their window is only open for so long with RadulovWeberPaciorettyPrice in their prime. Bergevin would be wise to either buy in big time or sell at the TDL.

Also how in the hell does not because they didnt deal Duchene or Landeskog signal that Im whining about Sakic not dealing them at the deadline? And since when have I been on a crusade against Sakic? Ive defended his moves this whole year when others are saying he should be fired. Just because you and I have had recent disagreements on the direction this team should take doesnt mean that Im against Sakic. Get your facts straight. And youre wrong there. There was a deal to send Tyutin to PIT but Yzerman stepped in and sent them Streit.
