However they generally only come in a handful of sizes and for nonUS coins you generally end up having a coin that slides around since you have to find the next best size. Staples can also scratch the coin when putting it intaking it out. You also have the possibility of a staple scratching through the mylar opening if you stack them.  Mylar flips have the advantage of fitting most coins without having to get certain sizes however the coin can slide around a bit and it gives some friction.

So the class is full of archaeology students Library students history students etc. We told the instructor who is the museums registrar our academic interests and mine were th century US Civil Warreconstruction African American history and thth century immigration and minority history... I can get more specific when I dont want to sound all over the place but those are the things I like the most.Anyway so then she took our responses and gave them to either the Anthropology curator or History curator who then came up with objects for each student. They all had particular reasons for being chosen for each particular person but some like mine were a lot more obvious than others.Edit Id love to learn more about numismatics in an actual history course that sounds really neat.,coins,ch3flwz,2,t5_2qhuq

Cleaned coins are always very tricky to find and if a coin has one damaged side with the other being perfect it will always be graded on the worst side.The reverse is in much better shape than the obverse in my opinion.

It was the last United States dollar coin to be struck for circulation in silvergtWith the passage of the Pittman Act in  the United States Mint was required to strike millions of silver dollars and began to do so in  using the Morgan dollar design. Numismatists began to lobby the Mint to issue a coin that memorialized the peace following World War I although they failed to get Congress to pass a bill requiring the redesign they were able to persuade government officials to take action. The Peace dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in December  completing the redesign of United States coinage that had begun in .gtThe public believed the announced design which included a broken sword was illustrative of defeat and the Mint hastily acted to remove the sword. The Peace dollar was first struck on December   just over a million were coined bearing a  date.

This is the same as an actual trade craft which the system is designed around so at first you are an apprentice then you are a fellow of your craft then finally a master of it. gtThinking about asking him since my grandfather was multiple states away.This is important as Masonry is not the same technically in every area. One area may follow Scottish Rite while an other a county away may be York or something else. Its always better to ask locally. Your local Masonic lodge usually has a meeting time posted outside their hall or published in the paper. The halls are often very noticeable which I always find laughable since people think were so secretive. Learning more is as easy as showing up when someone is at the hall and ask them a question. Some lodges require an interview process for new applicants. This is done because there are lots of people that like to join then cash in on member charity.

Furthermore most smaller branches including some main branches do not buy halves dollars or two from the fed. I work in a main branch where I am one of two guys working in the coin room. We typically sell bags of dollars in  and halves in . It takes anywhere from  months to fill either bag for us. We do have the capability to roll the coins but my friend and I are so focused in the sound that we catch most silver before it reaches anyone else. To get back on topic I get say a  dollar check cashed in halves and dollars would be a pretty hard thing for us to pull off. ,coins,ckktxli,5,t5_2qhuq

Numismaticcollectible value is a problem too.

3899736,0,t1_cr0s763, CC is absolutely a better date. Its even a better date among the already valuable CCs. In that condition that coin would be worth several hundred dollars if authentic. The dead giveaway is the supermushy strike. Notice the complete lack of detail in the center part of the coin. Also the motto and the mint mark are just slightly too large. The other thing to look at is the denticles which look irregular and very abnormal. Another key thing to notice is the difference in detail on varying parts of the coin. Based on the wear to the eagles breast and wings the coin should be about F. However the detail remaining on the wreath is more indicative of a coin in the XF range. The detail on the eagles neckhead is also of similar quantity as would be seen on an XFAU coin but is much more crude than Morgans design. ,coins,cr0sydq,3,t5_2qhuq

Ask him about a series you are familiar with and buy some junk silver or bullion and see whats happens.If everything seems kosher THEN Id start looking at bigger ticket items and raw coins. Having a slabbed coin by ngcpcgs will solidify authenticity and grade. Also see if he is a pngAnapcgsngc certified dealer. If they are then thats a good sign as well.

6091868,0,t1_cyhxck1,It can be tough to grade from static photos only always have the coin in hand when making a grade call. Im seeing a lot of marks on the cheek but if you say the luster is there then Id agree I would place the grade on the lower end of MS around  still not enough value in this datemintmark to have it certified by a TPG. It is also much harder to tell a coins surfaces when photographed through any type of plastic like the x flip. It tends to reflect a lot of shine from the lighting and can give off the look of polishing I didnt take that into consideration. I grade a lot of coins over at CCF and hit probably  I was a dealer for many years and have gone through basic and advanced grading courses at ANA Summer Seminars I am good friends with several PCGSANACSSEGS graders and have been involved in the coin business since the late s. Not that any of that matters grading is only an opinion and for what its worth unless its from someone you know personally and done in hand the grade is worth every cent of what it cost you  At least the major TPGs stand behind their grades with a money guarantee.I certainly could be wrong in my assessment of your coin and dont want to come off sounding flippant like its cleaned for sure.

Thanks.You do not need an expensive camera.What you need is a tripod and a camera that takes long exposures.Just set down a sheet of .x paper place the coin on it use as much natural light as you can take your time aiming your camera to eliminate shadows and use a long exposure shot.If you have no direct control of exposure times with your camera then you can use the night mode which will force the camera  to take a long exposure shot.

7685038,0,t3_4kkcgb,Looks to me like a very nice coin but both the toning which is undoubtedly etched into the surface at this point and is irreversable and the scratch are holding the grade back. NGC is viewed both by the marketplace and by myself personally as being very slightly looser than PCGS. I think youre lucky enough the coin did not get net graded with the scratch. As far as the grade goes you must remember that the value of a coin changes often dramatically with a small change in grade. The services are cognizant of that. A very similar coin to this without the scratch is worth more. The services WILL do their best to reflect that in grades assigned they arent just assigning a grade but also a price range.  Do you plan on keeping the coin long term?  If so whats the difference if its in a VG or an F holder?  Are you collecting coins or plastic slabs?  If youre trying to maximize value right before you sell it I understand your frustration. If not perhaps consider what youre trying to accomplish? ,coins,d3fqp7r,3,t5_2qhuq

At the time they were minted Early s silver coins had become much more common in the region as a whole so the novelty wasnt there and the access to silver in general was greater. The Yangban upper class was mostly made up of military officials and civil servants as well and that section of society was taking a pretty big hit at the time due to the Japanese occupation which probably contributed.

Also i cant buy a second one because of the household limit while i wait for the investigation.

9431272,0,t3_59unj4,Every coin at a price.  If you are selective buy coins you think are conservatively graded at a price close to the current market youll do fine.  As for a particular formula   look for coins that used to trade for more over the past couple of years but seem suppressed at the moment.  For instance right now Saints in MS and MS seem to me to be unusually soft in my opinion.   Look for coins with a significantly lower mintage in a series but currently demand a small premium.  As an example there were under K  halfeagles minted and over . million S halfeagles minted yet in MS the  trades for only about a  premium.   Look for coins that could go up if one of two or more things were to happen a goldsilver goes up b the coin increases in desirability due to scarcity or ???.  This is mostly for more modern issues.  Probably the most important thing is have someone you trust that you can go to for a second opinion and get feedback on your new purchases.  So if you buy a coin go to a show and say to a dealer Im NOT looking to sell this coin but I bought it for YYY and would like your feedback.,coins,d9bh88x,3,t5_2qhuq

9915925,0,t3_5hfsoq,The most important piece of advice is when you are handling a dealers coins keep them above their table. If youre sitting down dont put any on your lap or drop your hands below the table. You dont want to be mistaken for a thief. Dont randomly put your hands in your pockets while handling their coins either thats another thing thieves do. Im not sure what you mean by get some opinions on them? Are you wanting to know what grade your coins are approximately? How much dealers would purchase them for? How much they sell for? Whatever you mean just be upfront about it at the beginning of the conversation. They might make an offer to purchase them even if you say you dont want to sell them.Ive been to hundreds of coin shows and usually you can find a couple of dealers at some of the big shows that take credit cards but Id say  dealers dont take credit cards. If you looking to purchase anything  or higher you better bring cash.You can find bullion at most coin shows.  junk silver silver rounds etc.Have fun! Youll see a bunch of new coins youve never seen before. If you purchase anything cool be sure to share with everyone on rcoins,coins,db02i0u,4,t5_2qhuq

10957017,0,t3_5whi08,You have a slight offcenter strike. Though it is a minor error the mint doesnt mind letting these into circulation and they turn up all the time. This one is worth ten cents. Edit I believe uchristmascod is correct about it being a misaligned die. Still a minor error still pops up a lot. Cheers.,coins,dea4zp5,5,t5_2qhuq

11106247,0,t3_5ykmee,Its all about lighting and finding the sweet spot in distance with the camera. My set up is like this.. Sony Xperia Z phone Stack of ngc or pcgs slabs add or remove a few to adjust distance for optimal resolution the camera zoom is useless here Two three or even four Jansj lights with white baking paper wrapped around once to diffuse the light. Without its way too harsh. Try to offset the light at the  oclock and  oclock positioning on the coin and use the shadows for depth. I find setting the light source high off the coin gives a better fill and helps to reduce hotspots. The biggest problem youll find with a camera phone is that it will cast a shadow on the bottom half of the coin sometimes. It can take a lot of work to minimize that. A trimmed sheet of white paper with a hard plastic coin insert underneath for a slight tilt helps to bring in all of the elements to focus and any toning that the coin might have Adjust your white balance for color accuracy and adjust the light intake. I keep my ISO low as it I find that it helps to reduce noise. Set the shot timer on a  second delay step back and pray.Import the images into a imaging program and youre done. Some people will crop out the background but Im too lazy for all of that.Here are few of my better pictures..Barber Half Dollar Swedish Krona Mexican  RealesNote Sometimes if the coin is too shiny you may need to build out a lightbox. I think that this is the guide that I used dont remember but but the principles are all the same. Good luck and let us know how it turned out!tldr  Lighting and lots of fussing.,coins,deqvtgv,12,t5_2qhuq

11340233,0,t3_61u4la,I am guessing the original reverse design was abraded off in order to engrave it with the present design probably as a charm or token.

Once the formula is made then you just copy it to the remaining  rows. Your data goes on Sheet and the mintages references list would go on sheet .It would require a bit of work but it still would be a lot less time than manually looking up and punching in the numbers. ,coins,dgree2d,2,t5_2qhuq
