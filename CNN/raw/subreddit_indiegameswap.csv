At no point did I condone umattymesss repost since it is technically a breach of the rules so I dont know why youre arguing over that.You also seem to be setting a clear double standard here. Whether or not you find your old comments relevant which if I may add are still relevant when youre deleting rejected offers you are deleting them with the intend sic to bypass some subreddit rules intentionally or not. According to rindiegameswap rules under Trades Gone Bad  What Not To Do it clearly states not to delete anything. If you delete things we have to assume the worse. Its just bad for everyone involved. Unless you believe that global rules override subreddit rules in which case you should just leave his old thread be so that it can stay deletedremoved.Now my intent here isnt to start a fight with you but to hopefully put an end to a series of deleted comments Ive been noticing.
