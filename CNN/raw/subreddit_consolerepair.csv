4889907,0,t3_3hvc7c,The knockoff pads might have the same issue they may not have enough attention to detail to make sure the buttons are exactly the right shape. Also if I remember correctly the buttons on a genuine SNES pad are notched on the bottom so they only fit into one opening on the controllerpresumably so they were easier to assemble correctly at the factory. The buttons on a nongenuine pad might not be notched such that they would fit into a genuine pad.At the end of the day genuine controllers are so cheap that you might as well just buy another one. Right now I see two genuine controllers in one eBay lot with  hrs left and no bids. The opening bid  with  shipping. Even if you were able to find replacement buttons theyre at least going to be  by the time you factor in shipping. My opinion is that you might as well just buy a new pad and if you every come across a very cheap broken one or get a beat up controller in a lot then harvest the buttons for your repair project.,consolerepair,cuawtum,1,t5_2tjv1

6385304,0,t3_42zvs1,Unless youve reflowed boards before I highly suggest avoiding the oven process it is actually not very friendly to beginners. If youre insistent on keeping it cheap use a small electric skillet as a preheater under the board and use a heat gun from the top. Cheap  harbor freight heat gun on low can do it but keep it a decent distance from the top.For the actual reflow squirt a tiny amount of liquid flux into the barelythere gap between the chip youre reflowing and the board and make sure the boards sitting as damn close to perfectly level as you can get it as you lay on the heat. By the way dont skip the flux. If you know how to solder you know how important it is to any of this working.Ideally you should really be doing a full reball on it and using a proper hot air station for all the work if you want it to really have some new life but you seem like youre just trying to flip it for some quick cash.Id recommend against your extra slits to the case for better cooling it will likely be a bunch of ugly holes that do little to nothing for the benefit of actually cooling the system without air being forced to them.Good luck.,consolerepair,czffwaf,2,t5_2tjv1
