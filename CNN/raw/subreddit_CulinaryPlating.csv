4154932,0,t3_389kau,Im no plating expert and I am here to learn too.  My suggestion is that you scatter the mangoes around the plate with the tomatoes instead of laying them on top of the salmon.  It makes the dish look more composed and focused to me.,CulinaryPlating,crtviop,1,t5_38fyw
4531045,0,t1_ct1rpvw,gttoo much truffle. LOL. I have never uttered those words. Not my fault you dont bother balancing flavour. Anyway you post to a forum that aims to share good plating and say its OC. Of course Im going to critique it. You can mock them but two of the dishes you linked look good. Only one looks shit which is with the cucumber. ,CulinaryPlating,ct1ruvw,2,t5_38fyw
5646452,0,t1_cwwtsbi,Thank you. I have turned thumbnails on. And man that was easy.,CulinaryPlating,cwwzwf7,1,t5_38fyw
5658110,0,t1_cwyf5wq,Thats actually a solid idea. The beet chips were supposed to be the toast texture but they didnt quite work out.,CulinaryPlating,cwyfzcw,1,t5_38fyw
6002221,0,t3_3scc4g,Love it! Im also a fan of doing themed dinners. I did one based on Game of Thrones and more recently Jurassic Park. Theyre so much fun. ,CulinaryPlating,cy6f6eb,1,t5_38fyw
6018253,0,t1_cy8ijup,Yah I was worried about blowing peoples pallets out cause that soup was legit! I wanted a showstopper first course. It succeeded. ,CulinaryPlating,cy8iogv,1,t5_38fyw
6639104,0,t1_d05jwg3,Yeah looking at getting some larger round white plates instead but youve got to make do with what youve got. ,CulinaryPlating,d061h4h,2,t5_38fyw
6809020,0,t3_490fbq,Sorry that should say plumped apricot in the title. ,CulinaryPlating,d0o3kpv,2,t5_38fyw
7055737,0,t3_4c7fip,Its great. However Im gonna be real picky and say the sauce is too red. I love eating very rare beef Ill eat it raw if its good quality but this sauce just seems too red to be appealing it looks like it could be blood or beet juice. I know once I taste the sauce itll feel different but I cant. In my opinion the deep reddish brown of demi glace is the ultimate when youre plating steak. ,CulinaryPlating,d1g4l0k,1,t5_38fyw
7427887,0,t1_d2mflvi,Been shopping around for a caddy to put the spices in be it a jar or something else.  I usually use a wine bottle for olive oil as we have plenty of pour spouts and I have my own corker since I make my own wine so I can always seal the bottle for next time.  I like the idea of steeping the spices in the oil before though. I should do up a few bottle and cork them and more importantly label them LOL and throw them in the wine rack to sit for a while.,CulinaryPlating,d2mi4l6,2,t5_38fyw
8844245,0,t1_d7ay4ac,Yeah sweet i do dry them on a chux before hand. Maybe i was lied to.. i mean no other protein i cook spits when its seasoned first!!,CulinaryPlating,d7ayb7l,1,t5_38fyw
8906112,0,t3_529l29,I know the eggplant doesnt look great haha,CulinaryPlating,d7idwbm,1,t5_38fyw
8984317,0,t3_53ccca,I got a lot of good advice from my first attempt at this this is my second attempt.  I tried to fan out the steak and use garnishes that could be eaten.  Please be as harsh as you can Im looking to learn here!,CulinaryPlating,d7rrzcv,6,t5_38fyw
9291466,0,t1_d8tq1ao,Should have been more clear.  I meant freshen up in terms of color. And if the puree is really thick you can always smear it like someone else mentioned.,CulinaryPlating,d8trd7j,1,t5_38fyw

10529870,0,t3_5qqx5w,Part of it may just be the image or camera angle?  The pancetta sage and scallops just end up looking like a dark brown clump in the middle of the puree.  Colorwise a single pop of bright red might be nice in the middle but Im not sure what can go there.,CulinaryPlating,dd1obxl,1,t5_38fyw

10740460,0,t3_5to2vp,Had some trouble coming up with how to plate this combo. I did a few different versions here but looking for feedback. Ive been practicing and trying to work on my plating recently.Album,CulinaryPlating,ddnspuh,1,t5_38fyw
