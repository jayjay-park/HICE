As we can see today it was  disaster with the Islamists backstabbing the left and taking power turning Iran back into the repressive regime it was before.,islamicleft,cyoyfij,1,t5_3bi6v
7001850,0,t3_4bk6pq,Hey thanks for contributing to the sub. Now to answer your question about atheists participating in an Islamic leftist movement there isnt really a large coherent Islamic leftist movement at the moment or even any sort of Islamic leftist intellectual movement. I dont know if what youre saying is really much of an issue. Muslims interested in socialism often try to become part of secular socialist parties we come from the outside. And the only real issue we end up facing is trying to fit into already well established socialist tendencies and movements. The goal of this sub is really to explore some new waters really.  ,islamicleft,d1a05uj,4,t5_3bi6v
