1437422,0,t1_ciuvk9a,In the mids DC merged the worlds in their multiverse together using Crisis on Infinite Earths as an inuniverse explanation.  They also used the crisis as an excuse to reboot some of their characters to various degrees.  In Jasons case it was used to give him a new origin but he was still the same character before Jim Starlin made him as unlikable as possible in a successful attempt to kill the character off.,Robin,ciwgh5q,1,t5_2qjtx
