1614514,0,t3_2csk64,Oh it is against the wall sorry if I was unclear.  The end table is in the corner of the room.    It is really more of a cabinet with about  inches of clearance below it its approx  x  with x legs on the four corners the dock is under that against the wall.  I watched the roomba go all the way across the room to find it last night and then go right into where it is but as soon as the nose of the roomba hits the plastic of the dock it starts to move the dock sideways against the wall.     My idea of having it park under the cabinet thing is to deter our  year old from making it her new chair.,roomba,cjiocso,2,t5_2rzfe

4905792,0,t1_cty9ml5,I just wanted to add on a question about this.  So if I get a roomba and have it in one room would it clean that solitary room? or would I have to manually move it around the house in order to get other rooms?,roomba,cucwudy,1,t5_2rzfe
5032744,0,t1_cus84k0,To piggyback on this a little my Neato does map rooms so it will do all the edges do the middle of the room then declare itself done. It normally lives upstairs and is scheduled to run while my boys are at school though twice a week or so i take it downstairs and run it there half hour later or so it does a satisfied little chime and i put it back on its base upstairs.,roomba,cusmxrf,3,t5_2rzfe
5792739,0,t3_3uid9a,Mine does this too of late roughly  of times when it tries to dock. Im fairly sure its something to do with the metal plates not making good contact with the base pins but will watch this thread with interest to see if someone more knowledgeable has advice ,roomba,cxf56zt,1,t5_2rzfe
5883104,0,t1_cxqgflo,Yeah thats kind of what I figured. Either a problem with the battery or the charging cable. Its about  years old though so the battery is most likely the culprit. Thank god I bought it at Costco with their awesome return policy. Im going to attempt returning it in an hour or so. Otherwise I guess Im busting our the multimeter. ,roomba,cxqt3it,1,t5_2rzfe
