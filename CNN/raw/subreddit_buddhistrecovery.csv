2329273,0,t3_2lz406,I dont think I was capable of real meditation in early recovery but I did discover this practice of cultivating disbelief in everything I thought which probably saved me from numerous relapses.  I would also meditate by writing things out on paper to get my thoughts straight about something or to find out if I was being delusional or not. Also Ive said before about the practice of listening meditation at meetings or at home with AA speaker tapes.  I would try to focus on what another person was saying without my mind wandering.A newly sober person alone in their heads without supervision can be a dangerous thing!!!  ,buddhistrecovery,clzm0ah,2,t5_33snf

3303828,0,t1_cp4kb6o,gtWhile I wouldnt necessarily recommend a meeting studying the  steps is not a bad idea. I have been doing this. I have  amp  and saw a lot of books that look really interesting. I read the beginning of this book and thats what got me interested in AANA because I realized that I am in a similar situation of coming off of drugs but not yet finding my emotional sobriety or to put it in the language of the Steps I havent yet taken Step  I havent yet become willing to let go of my faults. gtRecovery meetings can also be about forming bonds of love and service with each other not just crisis management and detox. If you go seek out the oldtimers for a bit of wit and wisdom. I hated the idea of going at first but now I would no more do without my recovery meetings than I would refuse food and sunshine.gtJust so you know that feeling of being not able to fit in is a classic symptom of addictionalcoholism. So your perception of what passes for reality here on this planet may be skewed by your disease. But if you have a worldwide organization of people who dont fit in then if you have the same issue youll fit right in. Its one of the paradoxes of recovery along the lines of youve got to give it away to keep it.gtShame and guilt is also a part of the alcoholicaddict mindset as well as lack of trust so welcome to the club there too.     Haha. Thanks those are very encouraging words. I have been torn on the idea of going to a meeting. Im leaning towards it lately. The ideas really have been helping me lately and have been giving me a lot more perspective. No matter what I decide I think Im going to get a notebook and ready begin putting what Im learning into action. I appreciate the advice thanks. ,buddhistrecovery,cp4v2rt,1,t5_33snf
