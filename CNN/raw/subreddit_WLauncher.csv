4597644,0,t3_3dltre,On random sometimes when my phone reboots all of my tiles will disappear. Im using a OnePlus One on a . rom. The app is great overall though! Keep up the nice work!,WLauncher,cta4gim,2,t5_385to
4897284,0,t1_cubklu3,Its great but risks becoming cluttered when you have a lot of apps. Adding a alphabetic scrollbar like the one in contacts would be great but it might make it look ugly. Also maybe have an option for the old app drawer layout? Starting to miss the slide up animation ,WLauncher,cubub25,1,t5_385to
