5598606,0,t1_cw57wcm,Simple Guidelines for Charging Lithiumbased BatteriesA device should be turned off while charging. This allows the battery to reach the threshold voltage unhindered and reach low saturation current when full. A parasitic load confuses the charger.Charge at a moderate temperature. Do not charge below freezing. See BU Charging at High and Low TemperaturesLithiumion does not need to be fully charged a partial charge is better.Not all chargers apply a full toping charge and the battery may not be fully charged when the ready signal appears.Discontinue using charger andor battery if the battery gets excessively warm.Apply some charge to an empty battery before storing  percent SoC is ideal.,craftymighty,cwr26ro,2,t5_3a4n7
5685737,0,t3_3svwzg,I managed to make it a bit more bearable by dropping the temp and adding some moisture to the bud before vaping. Should hold me over until I can craft a water cooling setup.Thanks for all the suggestions.,craftymighty,cx1vcta,2,t5_3a4n7

You keep the cooling unit as well they will send you a new one for every warranty return.I have never touched the oven in my units and did an experiment with a brand new one where I found that it didnt effect the performance or taste at all.,craftymighty,d4hqx5h,1,t5_3a4n7
9598326,0,t3_5ceq6a,Did you make sure your top screen is clear? I only noticed that happening when the screen was clogged and the vapor condensed back on the top of the capsule.easiest way to clean it is to use alcohol prep pads immediate following the session. ,craftymighty,d9w6uif,2,t5_3a4n7

11737757,0,t3_67gynd,I think that the scenario is unlikely  short of one battery completely exploding.  Aqpak must test the battery packs before sending to sampb to discard any shitty ones.  Realistically by the time one battery is dying the other would be in a similar state.  Whether the firmware would allow it no idea...  probably not if one of the packs was disconnected.  But the heating element is the same in every way as the craftys.  Same voltage but has more amps to draw on in the mighty.  Even with shit batteries the mighty will still work on mains  all hail mighty,craftymighty,dgqi6el,2,t5_3a4n7
11746587,0,t3_67j8yb,Just keep it clean and ride it into the dirt then do that upgrade. Your duty cycle is a little high for the Crafty but right in line with a Mighty. ,craftymighty,dgri7ah,1,t5_3a4n7
