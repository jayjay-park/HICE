6265815,0,t3_41f3hg,I am about done with the game. I want to like it but it just seems too intensely grindy and punishing to play unless you plan on sinking hundreds of dollars. I dont much care for fp games that opt to punish free players versus rewarding paying players so I dont give them my money. It shouldnt be near impossible to play as a free player.,StarTrekTimelines,cz1uqef,3,t5_32487

I am primarily FP. Ive purchased  monthly cards and technically spent  with Google Rewards. The ability to Warp alone makes the game more enjoyable by eliminating the monotonous pointless grinding and taps. The extra shuttle will help you level up faster and it will help you be more successful in events and get the higher level characters. Im Episode .

If you ask me only OBrien got one thats actually useful.That said I would have certainly preferred Bashir to get doctor. Its not exactly as if we are swimming in potential choices for doctor traits or for medical crew as it is. Its the most under represented segment of the available crew roster.
