9912415,0,t3_5hbhsa,There is a bug with assists.  It counts the assist for the appropriate person but when the little icon that pops up saying Most assists  it will say the person who scored.  Bugs the crap out of me.,3on3,dazm066,2,t5_3glkp

10492093,0,t1_dcxdto9,Lol this is coming from experience I have a prestige  Luther with long dunk range and close cards and I still get stuffed half the time. Also blocking late when people use double clutch euro etc. is easy to me. I just think if you need a certain character or even double teams to stop one person might be a little op. Considering I have lost  to amandas and when my team picks amanda we rarely lose says something. I guess we can call her top tier if anything.,3on3,dcxe0fv,2,t5_3glkp

10994513,0,t3_5wzjls,I feel like Luther is the best under the basket center. Both Big Dog and Lee are centers but with a twist their main feature is something that isnt common in a center.,3on3,dee6zc5,3,t5_3glkp
