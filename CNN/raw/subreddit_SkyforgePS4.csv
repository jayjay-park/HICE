11492130,0,t3_63wb6i,Paywall update is remarkably overdramatic.this game is not pay to win it is pay to save some time.pay to win or paywall at least how i have always understood it is that you HAVE to put money in or gtfo. there is nothing here that you cant get for just some time invested instead. theres a very light daily limit to some things you can pay past there are ways to buy upgrade materials instead of just get them through running levels. its EXCELLENT as a free game you just will not be able to be bleeding edge progression without investing money but you will over time get ALL the same shit that people putting hundreds in get. so money is not at all needed.,SkyforgePS4,dfymr81,2,t5_3j7r2

11583224,0,t1_dg8yohe,From a casual stand point you would want to sign in do your directive and then probably call it a day since that takes an hour or two. But say the weekend rolls around and they have all day to play. They can do all the directivesbastionsinvasion quests since they stock up but not the TowerCathedral which just seems unnecessarily punishing.
