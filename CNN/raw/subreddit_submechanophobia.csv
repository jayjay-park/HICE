An example that I just callously stole from wikipedia regarding the Naval mine is this ... but one particularly diffusionresistant batchequipped with acutely sensitive pressure magnetic and acoustic sensors and wired together so that one explosion would trigger the restwas simply left undisturbed for years until corrosion would hopefully disable the mines.,submechanophobia,co13byy,2,t5_2xtuj
2935263,0,t3_2rlug0,Story time When I was a kid I was obsessed with the Titanic my grandmother had two books on it and I used to sit there and look at photos and read about it every time I went over there. I wanted to be Robert Ballard and explore shipwrecks when I grew up. My parents bought me shipwreck books too I loved it.Eventually my grandmother got worried that I was developing a morbid curiosity so she hid the books away from me one day. I was pretty bummed but she wouldnt admit that she took them. My parents didnt say anything either. I forgot about it for years but about five or six years ago it came up again and I realized I was absolutely terrified of shipwrecks. Im thinking about seeing a therapist maybe theres some weird subconscious thing going on here but I want to get over it. And thats my story.,submechanophobia,co1r2r0,2,t5_2xtuj

Wed go out on the canal on his boat and Id get paid  cents for each lap I swam around the boat for fun. And I always remember being scared to go so close to the boat because I didnt want to get trapped underneath it. And the thought of my feet dangling underneath me when I cannot see them scared me.  Maybe that is was set it off for me and I grew scared of objects basically floating in seawater who knows. Scary though just thinking about it.,submechanophobia,cu8rqzi,1,t5_2xtuj
5105256,0,t3_3kuwzd,I can remember the first time this fear manifested itself in me.  I had to have been really young like  years old.  My family went to a paid swimming pit.  As we walked by in the muddy water was a large tube like those that you put on dryers but much bigger.  It was half submerged in the mud and half sunk in just a couple feet of water.  It looked like a large worm to me and I really freaked out.  I was crying my dad couldnt figure out what was wrong and why I wouldnt get in.I also suffer from megalophobia as well.  We were in Alaska out on the ocean fishing for halibut on a  man boat.  As we came back in to dock there was an ocean liner docked.  I felt my legs go numb and my breathing get shallow.  I felt very dizzy as well.  I just have a really hard time with super large structures.  The first time I saw those windmill farms triggers this as well.  Skyscrapers do not trigger this feeling for some strange reason.Large pools of water like the Shedd Aquarium do it to me along with the whales in that tank.  My legs turn to jelly and I found it very hard to walk up to the window to watch them.  So its not an outright screaming fear I just pretty much lose control of my legs and feel dizzy when it happens.,submechanophobia,cv1dgt6,3,t5_2xtuj

I didnt even know this was a phobia until about a year ago.

So immediately after sorry I dont want to wait months to see you again were breaking up she was back in the fucking country and barely  miles away anyway. Yes I tried to make it obvious that I thought we should meet up for a coffee to talk about everything no I didnt get anywhere despite being the only person who understands her.

10688904,0,t3_5s5aoh,For me it was on a canoeing trip with my parents on Floridas gulf coast at Captiva Island. Our hotel rented canoes to guests and you could tour through the big marshy bay area at the back of the hotel. We set off and quickly learned that when people cant sell their boats or dont want to pay to have them towedscrapped they simply scratch off the VIN number and just leave them in the marshes.Around every twist and turn hidden among the shaded trees would be a halfsubmerged abandoned boat just sticking ominously out of the water. I was around  or  at the time and it scared the hell out of me  being in a tiny little canoe and paddling past a big abandoned boat. It certainly didnt help that we were in a marshy area with spider crabs scuttling up and down the trees. But the worst by far was in a more open area of the bay where we passed a halfsubmerged giant concrete barge.I also grew up in a town with a small harbor and ironically for this sub the rows and rows of big boats out of water stored away for the winter always creeped me out too. After a bad hurricane our harbor was full of washed up boats and giant yachts sticking vertically halfway out of the water. Ugh.Another thing that did it for me besides the canoeing trip and the harbor was the scene in jaws where they dive the sunken ship. Theres sort of a jump scare where you see a dead decaying guy with his eye missing. I watched that at around  or  years old. Nope.,submechanophobia,ddihcgk,1,t5_2xtuj
