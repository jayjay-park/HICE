10567284,0,t1_dd5sk0c,Thanks! It was brilliant. This was my first full band Divine Comedy gig so I cant compare to other shows but I loved it. Loads of songs of the new album but some nice oldies as well. They all seemed in good spirits and Neil is a great entertainer. ,TheDivineComedy,dd5x64j,2,t5_341ss
