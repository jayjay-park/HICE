35636,0,t3_1uagkc,Hey everyone!  Todays the fifth and Im halfway through chapter six.  Yes I can agree with many that the hardest part so far is keeping track of the characters and which princeprincess is which and what the relationships are.  I have yet to do the historical background readings so Im a little lost on the politics but the edition I have has editorial footnotes on some of the more major events so Im not too lost.  All in all so far so good.  Staying on track. However Tolstoys description of Helene was so over the top it almost seemed obsessive IMO.  I mean do I need to know every adorable little detail of her obviously delicate appearance?  Shes amazing looking We get it!  Its the style of writing though.  Ok I feel better now.  See you all next week!,WarAndPeace2014,ceihlu2,2,t5_2zcbu
191330,0,t3_1vdlme,One thing Im getting from Book  is that the society people seem to need often selfcreated tragedy to feel content or human. That one scene where Boriss mom gets the money from Mrs Rostov and theyre hugging and crying and Tolstoy gives all the sad reasons for their tears but notes their tears are happy... I feel that applies to all the women. They all have fairly petty worries and Tolstoy uses those worries to define them as characters.As for the language I love how Pierre is one of the few to be never or rarely speaking in French. French is the language of falsity and thus often of the women and Pierre despite his Frenchness is one of the least Frenchy people there.,WarAndPeace2014,cf08dg1,1,t5_2zcbu
799468,0,t3_1vc53m,Im just starting on it but it is for fun as well. That being said with some of the classics I find that going into further depth in the work helps me appreciate it. For example I often revisit chapter summaries on Sparknotes or follow a discussion or course while reading. One great example of this was when I read Don Quixote earlier this year... I learned a TON more and appreciated the novel significantly more by listening to the open Yale course on the subject.,WarAndPeace2014,cgv5hsk,1,t5_2zcbu
