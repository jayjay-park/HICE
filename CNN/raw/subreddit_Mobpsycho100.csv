8248394,0,t1_d58l4z3,Dont mouseover spoilers insides Sure youll find the answer in chapter  pages . Seems that Mob knew all along and was humouring Reigen because he liked him he does ask stuff throughout the comic like why didnt you do anything and are you really a psychic hes pretty stoic faced but I like to think hes amusing himself asking that and seeing Reigen give a ridiculous answer each time. Also maybe edit your posts so newcomers dont prematurely find out that Mob knows about his sensei!,Mobpsycho100,d58lsip,3,t5_3b3mr

Its still a story about Mob figuring stuff out about the world and defining an identity that fits with the things hes learned.

If there is I could see it going one of two ways either it ends with the Manga Spoiler but if youre on this thread Id assume youve already read the mangas fight between Mob and the Boss of Claw or if people are correct in assuming that the manga will end with chapter  they might wait until its finished and adapt the rest in the second cour. The first cour covers about  chapters so ending at around  to  chapters makes sense.,Mobpsycho100,d60ppa9,2,t5_3b3mr

8866470,0,t3_51ka34,I love Cromatie High too. Although not sure what exactly made you remember the manga I agree that there are similarities. The characters laid back attitudes in absurd situations or silly speech delivered in dead earnestness  for example. Also their jokes dont rely on sexual contents I remember Noboru Yamaguchi from Destrade High hating such jokes. Well Makai no Ossan does have such jokes but they remain really juvenile. Here are the works I recommend if you havent tried yetHelck Like Mob Psycho its serialized in Urasunday and MangaOne. The story is set in a fantasy world where humans and demons are having warfares. The protagonist is a nice smiling muscly guy who wandered into the demon empire. The characters are unique and wonderfully silly and the punchline are done very well.  The humor has warmth and is never dirty. The story also has lot of depth.Dungeon Meshi The story is set in DungeonsampDragonslike world. A group of adventurers travel inside a dungeon hunting and cooking its fauna and flora. Seeing them somehow make the strangest creatures into most ordinary looking dishes is really funny.Blazing Transfer Student  A boy transfers to a new school and gets mixed up in absurd battles. The characters overreact to the most ordinary things in school life start heated arguments which are often followed by overthetop fights.Golden Kamuy The story is set in early th century Japan. A man who has fought in the RussoJapanese War team up with an Ainu girl in search for hidden stash of gold.  Lots of gore violence animal carcasses and angry bears but the humor is always there. The facial expressions of the characters are priceless. Also lot of cooking.,Mobpsycho100,d7dmis4,3,t5_3b3mr

8956973,0,t3_52yubo,I definitely recommend starting from chapter one since the anime has skippedskimmed over a lot of content. You also have to read it on batoto because its one of the few sites that actually has all of the chapters and pages in order and all you need to do is make a free account. Also the art isnt the best but it does improve and becomes a lot more consistent throughout the series. Hope this helps! D,Mobpsycho100,d7ohsl1,4,t5_3b3mr

9103527,0,t1_d860snx,Sorry I dont know any manga reader that disliked Reigen from the start. Almost all Reigen haters watched the anime first. I actually was shocked to see people hating Reigen and they never existed before the anime. He manipulates Mob sure but at the end of the day he cares for him and wants him to be a better person. You really do not get anything about the manga reader. Read it. Its a completely different experience. You cant take Reigens manipulation serious at all which is what you are doing since you watched the anime first. No one took it seriously reading the manga. As someone who has read the manga first and then watched the anime Im going to say you have no idea what you are talking about. First impressions matter and the manga is the purest form of what ONE tried to write. Its not a massive deal at all. Read the fucking manga man. If you have the artwork pacing gag train they all dont allow you take Reigens manipulation seriously. ,Mobpsycho100,d863j53,1,t5_3b3mr

9217328,0,t3_56l9ea,reigen wasnt controlling it at all. His body was simply a vessel for a ludicrous amount of power and simply the aura of it leaking out was sufficient to create extremely dense barriers or negate psychic attacks and increasing his physical durability.Thats why it was pouring out of him constantly his body had no capacity to contain it nor did he have any knowledge whatsoever to even try to control it. To be honest its a small miracle he didnt simply explode from that level of power which is a thing that can happen.,Mobpsycho100,d8kd4gq,1,t5_3b3mr
