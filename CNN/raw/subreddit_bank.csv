2399600,0,t3_2mwu99,The Success of Public Banking Bank of North Dakota Outperforms Wall StreetWSJ ReportsBy Ellen BrownGlobal Research November  Ellen Brown.comRegion USATheme Global EconomyNEW ECONOMIC VISIONS SUSTAINABLE BANKING Cooperative Banking in the Aquarian AgeWhile  state treasuries were submerged in red ink after the  financial crash one states bank outperformed all others and actually launched an economyshifting new industry.  So reports the Wall Street Journal this week discussing the Bank of North Dakota BND and its striking success in the midst of a national financial collapse led by the major banks. Chester Dawson begins his November th articleIt is more profitable than Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has a better credit rating than J.P. Morgan Chase amp Co. and hasnt seen profit growth drop since . Meet Bank of North Dakota the U.S.s lone stateowned bank which has one branch no automated teller machines and not a single investment banker.He backs this up with comparative data on the BNDs performanceIts total assets have more than doubled to . billion last year from . billion in . By contrast assets of the much bigger Bank of America Corp. have grown much more slowly to . trillion from . trillion in that period.. . . Return on equity a measure of profitability is . about  higher than those at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan. . . .Standard amp Poors Ratings Services last month reaffirmed its doubleAminus rating of the bank whose deposits are guaranteed by the state of North Dakota. That is above the rating for both Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan and among U.S. financial institutions second only to the Federal Home Loan Banks rated doubleAplus.Dawson goes on however to credit the BNDs remarkable performance to the Bakken oil boom. Giving his article the controversial title Shale Boom Helps North Dakota Bank Earn Returns Goldman Would Envy U.S.s Lone StateOwned Bank Is Beneficiary of Fracking he contendsThe reason for its success? As the sole repository of the state of North Dakotas revenue the bank has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the boom in Bakken shaleoil production from hydraulic fracturing or fracking. In fact the bank played a crucial part in kickstarting the oil frenzy in the state in  amid the financial crisis.That is how the Wall Streetowned media routinely write off the exceptional record of this lone publiclyowned bank crediting it to the success of the private oil industry. It would be more accurate to say that the bank made the boom.Excess Deposits Do Not Explain the BNDs Record ProfitsDawson confirms that the BND played a crucial role in kickstarting the boom and the economy at a time when other states were languishing in recession. It did this by lending for critical infrastructure roads housing hospitals hotels when other states banks were curtailing local lending.But while the state itself may have reaped increased taxes and fees from the oil boom the BND got no more out of the deal than an increase in deposits as Dawson also confirms. The BND is the sole repository of state revenues by law.Having excess deposits can hardly be the reason the BND has outdistanced even JPMorganChase and Bank of America which also have massive excess deposits and have not turned them into loans. Instead they have invested their excess reserves in securities.Interestingly the BND has also followed this practice. According to Standard amp Poors October  credit report it had a loan to deposit ratio in  of . This ratio dropped to . in . The excess deposits have gone primarily into Treasuries US government agency debt and mortgagebacked securities. Thus the banks extraordinary profitability cannot be explained by an excess of deposits or an expanded loan portfolio.Further eroding the official explanation is that the oil boom did not actually hit North Dakota until . Yet it was the sole state to have escaped the credit crisis by the spring of  when every other states budget had already dipped into negative territory. Montana the runnerup was in the black by the end of  but it dropped into the red in March of that year and had to implement a pay freeze on state employees.According to Standard amp Poors the BNDs return on equity was up to . in   substantially higher than in any of the years of the oil boom that began in .The Real Reasons for Its Stellar SuccessTo what then are the remarkable achievements of this lone public bank attributable?The answer is something the privatelyowned major media have tried to sweep under the rug the public banking model is simply more profitable and efficient than the private model. Profits rather than being siphoned into offshore tax havens are recycled back into the bank the state and the community.The BNDs costs are extremely low no exorbitantlypaid executives no bonuses fees or commissions only one branch office very low borrowing costs and no FDIC premiums the state rather than the FDIC guarantees its deposits.These are all features that set publiclyowned banks apart from privatelyowned banks. Beyond that they are safer for depositors allow public infrastructure costs to be cut in half and provide a noncriminal alternative to a Wall Street cartel caught in a laundry list of frauds.Dawson describes some other unique aspects of the BNDs public banking modelIt traditionally extends credit or invests directly in areas other lenders shun such as rural housing loans.. . . Retail banking accounts for just  of its business. The banks focus is providing loans to students and extending credit to companies in North Dakota often in partnership with smaller community banks.Bank of North Dakota also acts as a clearinghouse for interbank transactions in the state by settling checks and distributing coins and currency. . .The banks mission is promoting economic development not competing with private banks. Were a state agency and profit maximization isnt what drives us President Eric Hardmeyer said.. . . It recently started offering mortgages to individuals in the most underserved corners of the state. But Mr. Hardmeyer dismisses any notion the bank could run into trouble with deadbeat borrowers. We know our customers he said. Youve got to understand the conservative nature of this state. Nobody here is really interested in making subprime loans.The Downsides of a BoomThe banks mission to promote economic development could help explain why its return on equity has actually fallen since the oil boom hit in . The mass invasion by private oil interests has put a severe strain on the states infrastructure forcing it to muster its resources defensively to keep up and the BND is in the thick of that battle.In an August  article titled North Dakotas Oil Boom is a Blessing and a Curse Ryan Holeywell writes that virtually all major infrastructure in the boom cities and counties is strained or exhausted. To shore up its infrastructure needs the state has committed hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.Meanwhile it is trying to promote industries other than oil and gas such as companies involved with unmanned aircraft manufacturing associated with wind energy equipment and data centers but the remoteness of the western part of the state along with the high cost of labor makes doing business there complicated and expensive.Hydrofracking which has been widely attacked as an environmental hazard is not as bad in North Dakota as in other states since the process takes place nearly two miles underground but it still raises significant environmental concerns. In  the state levied  million in fines against  oil companies for environmental violations. It also undertook a review of industry regulations and was in the process of doubling its oil field inspectors.The greatest stresses from the oil industry however involve the shortage of housing and the damage to the county road system which in many places consists of twolane gravel and dirt roads. Drilling a new well requires more than  truck trips and the heavy rigs are destroying the roads. Fixing them has been estimated to require an investment of more than  million over the next  years.These are external costs imposed by the oil industry that the government has to pick up. All of it requires financing and the BND is there to provide the credit lines.Lighting a Fire under LegislatorsWhat the Bank of North Dakota has done to sustain its states oil boom a publiclyowned bank could do for other promising industries in other states. But Dawson observes that no other state has yet voted to take up the challenge despite a plethora of bills introduced for the purpose. Legislators are slow to move on innovations unless a fire is lit under them by a crisis or a mass popular movement.We would be better off sparking a movement than waiting for a crisis. The compelling data in Dawsons Wall Street Journal article properly construed could add fuel to the flames.Ellen Brown is an attorney founder of the Public Banking Institute and author of twelve books including the bestselling Web of Debt.
