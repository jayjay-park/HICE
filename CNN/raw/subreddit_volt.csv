1701219,0,t1_cjqx04h,The very last of late model s and new s did receive a small battery upgrade roughly a  increase total compared to s... it made news in most Volt forums on Facebook and GMVolt.com but nothing much here on reddit.com and in mainstream news. However in my opinion I took the smartest route.  I bought a brand new  from a Chevy lot in S.C. for  off sticker this past April .  out the door after dealer incentives and US tax refund. So Id recommend waiting to the total redesign that will debut THIS January or finding a  or  saving yourself  and biting the bullet for a  a gallon of gas each day during harsh winter. In springsummer youd make it fine on a single charge. I usually wake up every morning to a  mile charge and get  usually with regen during my NC summer days. ,volt,cjtlnfq,1,t5_2t3n3

It felt like switching from D mode to L mode at first but the more I leaned into the accelerator the more aggressive the regen.  What freaked me out was that the harder I pressed on the accelerator the faster I slowed down.  But when I stopped I would zoom backwards.  I wanted to press on the brake to slow me down but the peddle I was pushing on to slow the car down forward turned into the peddle to make the car faster in reverse.

3968386,0,t3_35vtky,Thats not close to a deal and a pretty high amount for the car especially without those options. For comparison I paid  out the door for a brand new  mileage   months ago. This was before . was announced... I got  back from the government and it has Bose backup cam safety  and  polished wheels etc. Last year gmvolt.com had a thread in their buying and leasing section of all the new s and s left in the US and prices were around  BEFORE tax rebate for brand new cars. Meaning around k brand new....My  cent keep looking for a better price and dont forgo leather. Look   miles away if you have to but get it. I have cloth and everything sticks to it. To me they look like older cheap Chevy seats and dont match the futuristic dash. Leather matches nicely on this car and pushes it into a higher interior realm of Lexus or the like....plus the power savings on cool nights with the heating element of leather seats makes your car MUCH MORE effecient. Heat is  battery killer....basically it is my  regret not getting it. Make sure you join gmvolt.com and go to the buylease forum.

5670298,0,t1_cwgk0jn,Congratulations on the new car! Can I ask you a few questions? Im in the market and it looks like youve owned yours for about  weeks now. How many miles did it have and how much did you pay? Im seeing  models wk miles selling in between k in my area at Carmax. How do you like it? What do you not like about it? Any unexpected issues? What are some expected things you plan to look at? Im worried about the battery... buying used you still get that  year k mile warranty right? However  isnt close by but its right around the corner so how long will the battery last?For we price you paid what do you think about the prices? Car starts around k and at k miles and  years of age we are seeing them sell for k. Thats a big drop... very big drop. I plan to drive mine until it either gets crushed by the finger of God coming through the clouds or it literally explodes on me or gets to point where its cheaper to get rid of it than fix it. How long is it taking you to charge it? I live in the suburbs of downtown area so i can charge mine but will need an extension chord and thats if I get lucky wa good parking spot in front of my house. How long is it taking for you to charge? Are you getting the expected  miles per charge? How are you doing on gasoline?Anything you have to say Im here to listen! Thanks...congrats again!!,volt,cwzyft3,1,t5_2t3n3

Even if I find a rest stop with somewhere I can hook the Volt up to what use is a mileanhour charge rate midjourney?Other PHEVs and EREVs can manage rapid charge. Or at worst phase fast charge.

8708419,0,t3_4yy4bd,Looking at your post history...Your Volt was missing its charger when you purchased.Did you ever buy a qualified OEM charger to replace it?A battery charger be it for a phone laptop or EV has specific specs for legitimate reasons.When a battery is topping up the charger needs to reduce its power flow to trickle. I only learned this after losing my Chromebooks charger buying a compatible one exact same specs on eBay and having my batteries life go from  hours to  hours in  days.Bought the pricier OEM charger hoping it would solve the problem... nopeBattery was permanently damaged.That caused me to do some intense research...The cost of buying the nonOEM charger then the more expensive OEM charger then a new battery was... Lets just say Im frugal which is what precipitated this series of events Oh the irony.If you buy a nonqualified phone or laptop charger the battery capacity will be permanently damaged because it will charge at full power until ... and then some until the charger is disconnected.TLDR After reading your post history I think your problem is. The previous owner after losing the OEM charger bought a nonqualified charger and fampd the battery.. You bought a more affordable nonOEM charger and it fampd the battery.Overall the most costeffective deductive reasoning strategy is to do  full chargedischarge cycles and see how your EV range changes I promise it WILL increase.

9611954,0,t1_d9w1c3r,amenhopefully he realizes that aggressively pushing EV adoption indeed would help meet a ton of his campaign promises although tbh the Leaf is also built in the US... well see what happens ,volt,d9xvc2f,1,t5_2t3n3
9625033,0,t1_d9yotfu,Works fine they advise against it but Id say thats more for liability purposes.  Ive used a  foot one and Im leaning towards guessing mine is in excess of  feet now.  Ive used it for around a year now no issues as of yet.  I think its supposed to be  gauge or something?  I forget since its been awhile since Ive purchased it. ,volt,d9zhfd3,2,t5_2t3n3
9665313,0,t1_da4g223,Yeah thats probably it. If I am charging with delay based on departure time and then try to precondition in the morning will it keep up with the heater or will it not charge due to the settings?,volt,da4gakg,2,t5_2t3n3

10068337,0,t1_dbjx85y,I get the Volt.  That came out of the bailout money spent on research and development.  Edit Ill clarify.  Without the bailout money the Volt would not have made it.,volt,dbjxe29,1,t5_2t3n3

10810106,0,t1_dduyr9p,I cant remember which ones specifically. They are low rolling resistance tires but they arent the Goodyear ones that come stock. My other one had a similar issue when we changed the tires on it but we werent driving very much back then so I didnt put it together,volt,dduzi8q,1,t5_2t3n3

10874961,0,t1_de1h2c6,It may not be just that the first gen did so well...  Its also possible even probable that the second gen chemistry is sufficiently more advanced that the safety margin is similar in terms of engineering risk.Dont forget Chevrolet has been doing hundreds of millions of dollars of battery research.  Youd expect them to get something from all that...,volt,de1oazu,9,t5_2t3n3
10899210,0,t3_5vmz8y,Ive been meaning to check the owners manual Im sure its in there... when the ambient temperature drops well below freezing regen braking does not fully engage the first few times I use it. I hear the ICE motor revving  is it trying to warm up the regen system? After engaging a few times the braking returns to its normal grippiness. ,volt,de46cmy,2,t5_2t3n3

11206018,0,t1_df1xlyd,The belt is used for two things mainly.  to transfer power via mechanical motion and  to synchronize actions such as valves and ignitions. The Volt like almost all new vehicles have replaced most traditionally mechanical parts with electric ones. Things like AC compressor water pump and power steering are electrical now and things like valve and ignition timing are not used with electric machines. ,volt,df26sbb,3,t5_2t3n3
11257429,0,t1_df7p4yj,It is and I corrected multiple times just to see it the wrong price later in the day or next day. Since is was the same brand I suspect the operator baiting for sales. I was trying to get the . discount on the  gal min which is why I pushed it so close at times. ,volt,df80gpv,5,t5_2t3n3
11279991,0,t3_60xyrg,Sounds like we need an actual engineering response.Basically eco mode runs the compressor slower.  This reduces the pressure in the condenser and means the motor uses less energy to run the system.  This in turn reduces overall cooling capacity but increases efficiency.This is why lots of efficient fridges and the like have switched to variable speed compressors.  Modulate the speed of the compressor lets you get just enough cooling and use less power.,volt,dfakjp6,9,t5_2t3n3
