MLS doesnt need to take the first offer they get in Minnesota. If they dont get a good offer from Minnesota we dont get a team. The Vikings have a snowballs chance in San Antonio of landing a team.,sascorpionsfc,cgut834,2,t5_2u6sn

4533626,0,t1_ct1yzd0,Im not aware of a tendency to change the colors because of sponsorship. Columbus Crew comes to mind as a team whos sponsors colors Barbasol red white and blue do not align with the teams colors  black and gold.Also so far as Im aware stuff like team colors depends entirely on what the new owners want not what the sponsors want. So the worst wed have to fear from a Whataburger sponsorship is that the jersey would not be aesthetically pleasing what with the big orange sponsor and the Red and Black.,sascorpionsfc,ct23i3i,1,t5_2u6sn
