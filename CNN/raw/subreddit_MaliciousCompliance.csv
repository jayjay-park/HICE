In other words theyre not looking where theyre going and dont think to check for anything but the vehicles directly in front of them.Edit Not to mention that drivers commonly dont follow traffic laws.

So we would carry out a lot of relatively heavy CRT TVs.But the first thing you realize with a TV is that the weight is literally completely at the screen. If you looked down on a TV the TV might be  inches deep but the center of gravity is like an inch behind the screen. So if you pick up a box with a  inch magnavox and pick it up so the screen side is against your chest its super easy to pick up and walk with it. But if you pick it up and hold the rearportion next to your chest... its super hard. Its like taking a  pound weight and trying to hold it up with your arms straight out in front of you.So when wed bring the TVs around and put them on the counter wed always swing it around so the screen part faced the customer. But if the customer was a jerk? Wed put the rearpart towards them and give them the magic emasculating words This is kinda heavy why dont you let me help you out with it.I can honestly say of the dozens and dozens of times I said those magic words there wasnt a single dude that took me up on the offer.,MaliciousCompliance,deq5fed,304,t5_3boqz
