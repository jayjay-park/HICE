6596950,0,t3_460cci,Its been about  years since I attended so perhaps others who have been there recently or are still there can chime in.. There are plenty of apartments in the immediate area. Taylor StreetLittle ItalyTriTaylor has plenty of apartments in varying degrees of niceness and modernity. I once looked at a place that had some kinda oldfashioned stoveheater thing in the middle of the living room very weird to see. On the other end there are those that have been recently renovated and have a loft style to them. You really just have to get out there collect phone numbers and start scheduling appointments. The CTA buses run along Taylor Street for easy access to all three campuses. UIC bus also connects the three campuses as well. Highly encouraged to get roommates to bring down the cost. In the apartments I lived in in neighboring Pilsen and TriTaylor decent looking bdrs for . Paying  a month  split utils was awesome. Im sure prices have gone up some since. . I cant speak about AC since I didnt live in the principal grad student apartments SSR and rarely visited. And I dont know the rules either. I did attend a couple of parties over there with no issues so theres that.. Dont know how food is these days but it still is buffet style Apparently the West Campus min bus ridemin walk from the main East campus where SSR is located no longer has a meal plan cafeteria just fast food options. . The closest grocery store is Jewel on Roosevelt and Ashland. There is another on Roosevelt and Canal. And another on Roosevelt and State the furthest. So  grocery stores within . miles of each other. See here for farmers markets Theres also a Target on Roosevelt and Clark.. Taylor Street...and the rest of Chicago. Have fun!,uichicago,d01og2j,3,t5_2shzc

9264937,0,t3_56ujkj,No there is not a whole lot going on around campus on the weeknights. This doesnt mean that there isnt anything to do on the weekends. I have been to some kind of party on and off campus every single weekend. While the parties or social gatherings at UIUC may be right outside your door here you have to put yourself out there and you will have no problem finding people to hang with or things to do.In terms of dorming I live at JST and its nice but is quite quiet. Courtyard has a lot more going on in terms of social life. So either stay in courtyard or live at JST and have good friends at courtyard. Thats what I do and its honestly the best of both worlds.Exploring the city is also so much fun and most of the parties I go to are offcampus. However they are very accessible. ,uichicago,d8qeagb,2,t5_2shzc
