7530803,0,t3_4idwy0,This gave me anxiety. I started thinking about how this persons space suit was probably breached by some simple arbitrary task gone wrong. As they begin quickly fading away they look up and their mind begins to see the stars as butterflies. The last conscious thought as the biological computer containing an entire lifetime of memories and achievements begins to shut down for good snuffed out by the inhospitable void that makes up . of the entirety of existence.The true horror in this picture isnt the astronaut or the butterflies its the inhospitable blackness that surrounds them in a cold unempathizing death grip. And it is absolutely not imaginary.,ImaginaryHorrors,d2y7rs9,3,t5_2y0mz
