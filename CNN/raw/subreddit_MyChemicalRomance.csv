10018860,0,t3_5j4wze,I agree. I think that Stomachaches was a lot more cohesive and interesting lyric and sound wise.Parachutes is all over the place and feels too personal which basically alienates the audience. When all of the songs speak in general terms about how he feels about things going on or that happened in his life which we dont know much about they kinda lose some of the appeal tome I dont feel like I can relate to them as much even when I understand the feelings he expresses.I listened to the album in full a couple of times but I find it rather dull. Some songs stand out and I like to listen to them but those are just  or  out of the full album.I wish the album would have been more in line with the sound of  Im a Mess.,MyChemicalRomance,dbdhhyx,5,t5_2s0v1

11074429,0,t1_demrqad,The one I get caught up on the most is Disenchanted. I hear a few things when I listen to it.  I hear it from The Patients perspective where he is reflecting on his teenage years after having discussed it in the previous song. Thats about all it does for me from this POV.  I also hear it from the perspective of someone else. In another song in TBP like Dead! I perceive it to be the doctor and not The Patient who is singing. Likewise in my interpretation The Phantom is displeased with what hes seen of The Patients life and reveals himself to be The Patients father in an attempt to coerce him into returning to the living to fix whats broken. The motivation for that view comes from Welcome to the Black Parade When I was a young boyMy father took me into the cityTo see a marching bandHe said Son when you grow upWould you be the savior of the brokenThe beaten and the damned?To me The Patient is reflecting on this memory before he himself goes to joinlead The Black Parade. In my interpretation his father killed himself early in The Patients life because of the pain he experienced. His taking his son to The Black Parade was his attempt to get his son interested in the event so that when he was involved with it later his son would be able to see him. He said Will you defeat themYour demons and all the nonbelieversThe plans that they have made?Because one day Ill leave youA phantom to lead you in the summerTo join the black parade.Before he goes away he wants to make sure his son will be strong and not fall to the same thing he did. His journey into death comes with the title of becoming the new Phantom or leader of The Black Parade. This all makes perfect sense in my head. Im struggling to articulate it now. But basically the father promised that a phantom would help guide The Patient in leading The Black Parade. In my interpretation of the album this phantom shows up and is in fact The Patients father. ,MyChemicalRomance,den9yt2,1,t5_2s0v1
