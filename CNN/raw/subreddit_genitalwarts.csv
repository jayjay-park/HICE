10869617,0,t3_5rccxq,Yeah Id keep it. Like Cramjack says you never know when theyll come back. Best to be prepared.I bought two bottles of Tyginta but only needed one bottle. Keeping the second one in a safe place just in case I get a flare up again in spring. Flare ups always tend to occur in fall and spring.,genitalwarts,de14gjq,1,t5_3hntk
