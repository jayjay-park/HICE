10493995,0,t1_dcxflbz,These are the things that Im not too sure what they mean or what I can sayshow what I did.  I have a mkv file of lets say Movie A.  The folder that holds this file also has a DAT file.   I followed a video that shows how to convert videos from the VLC player and after it finished I was left with a video is playable but thats it.  As for transcode I do not know where that is or what I can do to use this code.  Sorry for sounding dumb but its a new thing for me so Im trying to learn along the way,VLC,dcxlrqp,1,t5_2rl1u
