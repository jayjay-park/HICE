I play a lot around am JP time until Ive got the same amount of wins as the leaders for the morning and I do the same thing at around pm JP time to get the extra bosses for the day.    I find that if I win  matches and then wait for cp to come back I get a boss next match  of the time.     Whenever there arent any bosses available im tanking hard because of the hopefully constant wins in the morning which if continued would make the bosses too strong.     Unfortunately Im going through  bottles a day right now. Never again after getting this monkey. Its too frustrating.

5057775,0,t1_cuvlkm1,Honestly I think the sharing strategy is pretty enough for top  players already for the fast  weeks. Now please put more focus if you r running top . My advise. Send all to your players now and check game frequently. Tanarez do a very good job in it. End the event when you can both take MVP and final hits! Wisely use CPs. . Dont be afraid to be a bad guy by doing double hits in order to gain MVPfinal hits. Spend your CPs on other zoos especially during your strong friends off hours. Indeed some of my friends having run  events already sent very few events today. They do double hits on their friends zoo to spend CPs.. No more adjustment please. You have to end up ASAP because you may need to use bottles to let you move to prior rank. Maybe you need to get up earlier such that Spacecat amp JenJen are active. Today I saw you got up that early too! And think about using bottles at that time.. Closely monitor the th players points. Keep your point within   which is a safe range. Using a bottle can let you move zp in advance normally. But you cannot use many bottles a day unless you have a lot of time to play game. Consider you need to have time to let people do the hit I can at most use    bottles a day too.. Maybe you form a closer group among Tanarez Zizzsan and Unicornpuzzy by using whatsapp. I feel you guys are in similar positions . Sometimes you guys focus on ones zoo before you guys open game at the same time. Dont know if it helps.The above advices may contradict to group spirit... but you are good enough in running this thread. I mean ppl here can understand ,zookeeperbattle,cuvnidz,2,t5_2zc9y
