2162851,0,t1_cleq8y0,Good grief  how many different ways do I have to tell you?There is a website being served up from HostGator  it just doesnt have any files photos or relevant content on it whatsoever.  Nonetheless its there!If youre going to buy and use a dedicated domain name just for email with no website then at least make sure your provider is doing the job right.  A broken website like the picture above does not inspire confidence in you or your business.Look at the WHOIS report.Now look at this error page on your domain.Now go talk to your email provider and ask them why if you dont have a hosted webpage one shows up on HostGator.  And have them fix it.  Thats what youre paying them for.  And if they cant or wont fix it change service providers.A broken or absent website is a very poor reflection on any modern business.  If youre not ready to host a website maybe because youre still working on it thats fine  just make sure your domain registration doesnt point to something which doesnt and shouldnt exist!,tampajobs,cleqxq5,-2,t5_2tcbu
