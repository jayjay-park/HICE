6521868,0,t3_42f5sm,I live Grasp myself. Its so good for early trades allowing you to come out with more health. It doesnt have a cooldown like thunderlords you can proc it several times in a fight with Jaxes innate high attack speed.,Jaxmains,cztwv3a,1,t5_390il
6921465,0,t3_44z0oa,Max Q. It is higher damage and gives you more trades. You  auto the creeps then WQ onto the enemy and get your rd proc after then e or fade back after pulling off the trade and rinse and repeat. It works really well into most matchups and the w damage is not great its just an auto reset but early in the game and with the passive nerfs you want more small early game trades than an all in with W max. Q max also lets you all in better after trades because it is way better for diving and decent for its mobility if your getting camped.,Jaxmains,d10vecd,1,t5_390il

8936898,0,t1_d7loln4,gtIf you want to try some alternative boots ive had some moderate success with cdr boots. Jax actually benefits a ton from cdr but its very hard to fit cdr items into his core build. Getting off an extra counterstrike in teamfights or duels can win you the game. I still prefer mercs or tabi though in almost every scenarioDrop  MR for  CDR at  and you can cap CD with TriSV.,Jaxmains,d7m300x,2,t5_390il

9616912,0,t3_5cq3vs,Hello from Illaoi subreddit.  Illaoi is slow tanky AOE monster here some tips . Dont let the jungler or any other coming except if he got CC chain or ranged like Naut Zac Poppy Vayne or when Illaoi got no ult. She love it to kill you and the jungler but have problems with CC and being kited. . Maybe you should build AS soon to destroy her spawned tentacles in a short time. . Use wards and minions to jump out of her ult like he still said and her test of spirit zone thats her main tools to kill you and poke you. . Try to stay behind minions so she cant use test of spirit. . I dont know how good is jax early dmg but maybe you should play aggro befor she gets ult. . Maybe you should counter pick her with Morg Kayle or Poppy. I have really no Idea how you can kill her generally with Jax without huge help cause she is made for melee fights. Btw. I played my last game against Jax ages ago I dont know what happens now if he use courage and hextech gunblade.,Jaxmains,d9yhd8s,3,t5_390il
9649688,0,t3_5d7ide,Personally I like building tank early instead of going the cookie cutter route.Tritankdmgtank. Merc almost always. Zerkers if Im fed as balls.In vs range matchups dont use stun to engage you can use it to run away because if you dont you will likely auto lose the trade.,Jaxmains,da2ivce,1,t5_390il

10014876,0,t1_dbcshwe,Is the synergy of rageblade and the onhit more valuable that the burst and little bit of Tankyness of tri? I stopped playing jax for a while and Im wondering about how viable rageblade is,Jaxmains,dbcytn6,1,t5_390il

10242842,0,t1_dc4zquo,Im not the OP but how do u win games when ur the only threat on the map?  Every lane lost except me so it was pretty hard to split without the enemy jg and mid completely destroying me.  Is the game just unwinnable at that point?,Jaxmains,dc5300q,1,t5_390il
10309318,0,t3_5nkwdl,Honestly best advice I can tell you is watch replays of your games and see why are you dying and what you should have done instead it is the best way to improve macro related things like that.Otherwise my best advice is dont die. It might seem idiot but most of the time I die as Jax is some stupid thing like diving wrong burning QE cooldowns for nothing or dont pressing R. We know how Jax is an intense macro champ giving his simple mechanics but give a time to think in your next moves and you will see a better KDA.,Jaxmains,dccm82z,1,t5_390il

11481782,0,t1_dfxe213,Basically if a champion with Adaptive Helm is hit with a spell that deals magic damage and then they are hit with the same spell again within  seconds that spell deals  reduced damage.So for Cassio if she QEs somebody and then within  seconds hits them with EEEQ. The subsequent Es and Qs will deal reduced damage.Another example The orbs following the first orb of Syndras ult will deal reduced damage to somebody with Adaptive Helm.For Jax if you hit them with another W or R passive within  seconds of the first time you hit them with those spells the spells will deal reduced damage.Thats what Rioter said.So  damage for both W and R ,Jaxmains,dfxgher,1,t5_390il
11534962,0,t1_dg0xiic,Oh i just realized the way op had phrased itgtfor an exchange in damage for just  seconds enough time to wipe out at least the enemys adcit sounds like he wants to use gargs while killing people. Which is what you cant do.,Jaxmains,dg3hnr8,1,t5_390il
