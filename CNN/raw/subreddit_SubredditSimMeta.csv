He wants his friends to be around him as lsd can make you imagine nonexistent things like for example stairs from your balcony to the ground! Your friends would save you before you decide to walk the nonexistent stairs from the th floorbut related to how the different colors and numbers from rthebutton had different meanings.

Theres evidence of this exact same occurrence happening multiple times this year alone through the DNC leaks. Normally people would call this blatant propaganda and be screaming for their heads as its dishonest and unethical. But because its not technically illegal for them to feed the biggest media corporations questions to their opponents we can all laugh it off as another crazy Republican conspiracy.Blows my mind how people  regardless of political beliefs  can tolerate this behavior from the top journalists in the US. ,SubredditSimMeta,d9p9qug,5,t5_38iwv

9792013,0,t1_dak1ha0,gtYour entire comment is doing this right now. Insults and sectionalism are part of politics.gtSome people have the selfrestraint to not bring their political opinions as justification for an entirely separate argument.Im not villianising opposing viewpoints. Im villianizing TD as a subreddit. If the mods didnt ban every dissenter and just let them get downvoted I wouldnt have a problem with TD as a subreddit. I still wouldnt agree with anything on it but I wouldnt call to ban it. Similarly if it acted exactly the same but just didnt hit the front page I wouldnt care. Its utilitarianism I think TD does more harm than good and therefore needs to go.gtWhere the hell is that? The post just says THE MEDIA IS RIGGED and says nothing about TD. There are comments below it complaining about the post being brigaded since it obviously was a post from Trumps account on debate night would easily hit It implies that the only reason the media has antitrump things is because its rigged and not because Trump constantly fucked up the entire election. When the media went negative on hillary and it did for justifiable reasons yes you didnt see rhillaryclinton spamming the front page.gtThis has nothing to do with harassing other users or subs we have our own rules to enforce.Theyre rules that prevent open discource and more importantly lead to a feeling for TD posters that the majority of reddit agrees with them thus forming an echo chamber. So when they venture outside of TD and get disagreed with they start yelling about mod bias and shills instead of just accepting that  year old males reddits core userbase are mostly liberal. That therefore leads to harassing other users via namecalling and lowering the quality of discource on other subs for the same reason.gtWhat I dont understand is how you think that reddit is unbiased. They obviously are which is why they should ban us.What? Again if the admins are so biased why is TD allowed to exist? They could have manufactured any number of reason to ban it long before now. rconservative rrepublican and reurope are still around as well. Please provide evidence of administrator bias against TD. That is aside from spezs recent stuff and the algorithm change.Im excluding those by the way because the spezening is a virtual nonissue that would get written off as a harmless prank anywhere else and because the front page edit actually affected uenoughtrumpspam in a similar fashion it just straight up reduced how often a single sub would be on the front page. Which is good in general as any sub dominating discourse alone gets boring even if you agree with the sub.gtYour nonpolitical reasonings for banning us all obviously stem from your political bias since you are making broad generalizations such asYou misunderstand. I do have personal biased reasons for wanting TD off the site. But theyre completely unrelated to politics.I come to reddit for three things humor information and debate. Ignoring humor for now and ceding that TD is occasionally useful for information albeit perverted through the lens of hardcore isolationists TD is just completely and totally unfit for debate.I can have a polite argument in rAskTrumpSupporters. I can have a polite argument in rPoliticalDiscussion . I can have a polite argument in rpolitics . I can have a polite argument in rworldnews . Ive even had a polite argument about gun control in rguns where Im the one in the minority. Hell were even having a by some standards reasonably polite argument on rAdviceAnimals  judging by the fact that we havent just descended into childish namecalling. And this is all despite the fact that by definition my politics are different than the people I argue with.I remember back during the primaries I had a perfectly reasonable argument with a trump supporter that convinced me there were reasons why a perfectly sane person in full control of their faculties could vote for trump while not being selfcontradictory.But TD by its nature encourages its users to respond to dissent with namecalling and accusations of shilling. Its bad enough when half the posts on the front page are calling everyone who disagrees cucks but as that behavior spills out amongst the rest of reddit and even makes people angry enough to reply in kind its just degrading the quality of the site as a whole.So when you saygtYou cant really back up either of these statements. TD provides what is arguably a much needed rightwing point of view on reddit.While I actually agree that a rightwing point of view on reddit is needed I disagree that TD should be providing it.It doesnt cause a discussion it just pissed people off and polarizes left and right wingers even more.If the hillary and bernie subreddits need to be banned alongside with it then so be it. But for the quality of discource on reddit to improve TD shouldnt be the subreddit providing that right wing point of view.And its not like banning the subreddit would ban the users. The moderate conservatives willing to make cogent arguments instead of just whine about cucks in an echo chamber would stay and migrate to another conservative sub. Its the circlejerkers who would leave to vote and to them good riddance.,SubredditSimMeta,dak2tsc,1,t5_38iwv
