If the center core is to be recovered it will be with a triple ASDS landing.Its not going to be a big extra expenditure to have  drone ships available by .

11038897,0,t3_5xmle5,I think too that Musk is promising so much stuff yet doesnt get much done. All SpaceX needs right now is achieving a steady launch cadence and letting the Falcon Heavy  Crew Dragon finally fly. I get that he wants to achieve great things through this company but for that it needs a steady income.

11043389,0,t3_5xj6fl,I think the only way to know how viable this may be is to understand the current process of designing manufacturing testing and launching a satellite.  Lets stick to satellite although as I said in another comment here there are other spacecraft types that might be constructed in this way.  We need to know how much extra weight and engineering needs to be put into the craft and the payload transport in order that it survives launch and orbital positioning.  How much testing is done on the ground to verify its going to get to its designated orbit and will function as expected.  This will indicate the financial costs and design constraints that this method produces or engenders might be the more accurate word?Once weve got an idea of that and we have a reliable system to connect those components onorbit we can compare the economies of scale we get from that masslaunch capability as well as the kinds of vehicles that can be designed when the earthbased constraints are removed.

I dont see why you need to smash a massive impactor into the planet if you are just trying to build an atmosphere.  Imagine living on mars and watching the scheduled shooting stars.  Given the mass that needs to be added each chunk would probably enter the atmosphere quite often.  It would be on regular intervals.

Your cars cruise control is an example of a system that uses a compensator to ensure your car stays at the set speed.A lag compensator is a compensator that create a phase lag in the frequency response of the system. This usually slows the system down takes longer to get to the desired response because it decreases the available bandwidth.

11620533,0,t1_dgd5qiy,Any solid hoopring placed around a gravitational body forms an inherently unstable system. Small deviations in ring shape or position feed back on themselves amp grow exponentially. The stability is only maintained so long as the ring is perfectly shaped and the gravitational centres of the ring and parent starplanet are perfectly colocated. In reality this is impossible to achieve without physical anchors or propulsive corrections. Forces from solar winds and variations in gravity field strength are two examples of displacing forces acting on the ring.The asteroids in the belt are each in individual elliptical orbits with various speedsaltitudeseccentricities. They arent tethered into a solid shape so they dont exert forces on each other when experiencing pertubations. Its not really a comparable situation.,SpaceXLounge,dgd75c5,3,t5_3eye9

As NASA physically does less the sad fact is they have become a risk adverse bureaucracy. They are effectively making it harder to get to space for example Blue Origin avoided NASA funding for the last round of Commercial Crew Program because they didnt want the excessive oversight and invasive transparency that entailed. Most damning example is Space Launch System vs Interplanetary Transport System. SLS is effectively competing for funding with ITS after Elon Musk made his pitch to the President But NASA want SLS despite the fact it is completely disposable which means it is wholly impractical compared to modern designs like Falcon  Falcon Heavy and ITS which are largely or wholly reusable. In an ideal world NASA would fund ITS through a minimum interference Space Act Agreement because large reusable launch vehicles are the future of space exploration.
