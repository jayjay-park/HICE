4931869,0,t1_cufv4n8,And Jack wanted to have some active time with his beloved he spent too much of the day snoozing around in his rotten clothes.Nooooo.He groaned with a cheesy grin quickly judging what exactly Midoris head was hovering over he was guessing his shoulder maybe chest hopefully not head as his arm reached out to push that supporting hand of Midoris to get her to collapse atop of him with a cheery giggle his other hand ready to block that predatory glasssnatching hand of hers and catch her of course.,YHRP,cug78wg,1,t5_39d7i
4941544,0,t1_cuhdl9m,Jack showed no resistance his amusement smacked off his face and out of his head as soon as he felt the struggle. She left him gobsmacked emotionally and quite literally as well. He laid still like everything in him had died for a minute as he comprehended how the only family he has this side of the family scurried away from him like he were a predator. And what does someone missing half their eyes and half their feet have to do to be perceived as someone to be running away from? Only as that question entered his head did he realize the magnitude of his actions.Midori...?Jack squeaked timidly turning onto his stomach to crawl toward Midori though the pillow separated them that didnt stop Jack reaching out toward it and laying his hand on one of the frightened hands that were gripping the pillow for dear life.T...Talk to me. Whats wrong?It was a long shot to ask that but how else was he going to know? And he had all the time in the world she wasnt going anywhere by the looks of it.,YHRP,cuhf5rt,1,t5_39d7i
8780628,0,t1_d7371m0,Yes Im sure you could. She replied her voice now matching her weary face. The both of them hobbled over to the bed with Midori guiding him through the dark room she knew so well. Once he was safely sat on the bed she scurried around shutting the door and turning the light on her nightstand on and grabbing a water bottle from a pile beside her bed. Then she sat down with an exhausted sigh as if she had just deep cleaned the entire room. what happened to your foot? While she asked she tried to grab the beer from his hand and replace it with the water bottle.,YHRP,d738z3z,1,t5_39d7i
8968752,0,t1_d7ouv5t,Yeaaaaah.Jack groaned clasping the blanket close to him as it was handed to him. He gazed over at Midori noting her weakening form collapsing atop the bed. He felt a pang of guilt a prick of consciousness returning to his silly self getting all hammered like this and expecting his severely ill girlfriend to pick up after him. He prayed his sober self would remember to make it up to her.I know. But uh not many lie about drugs school fights and parties.Jack chuckled quietly flicking his hand calmly.Whatever it is in past now.,YHRP,d7pwpf5,1,t5_39d7i
