8554458,0,t3_4wvml2,I dont think any of this is possible.And in the same vein a lot of your ideas are simply not possible. You could simulate some of them with complex event chains andor decisions but that would be very complicated unintuitive and possibly quite buggy.See this comment by usavolainen. The money system is hardcoded as is most of the diplomacy that you want to change. To change them youd need access to the engine and you are not going to get that.Sorry to crush your hopes and dreams. You have some great ideas but I dont think you can implement a lot of them.,ChaosMod,d6avqzp,2,t5_3fsxq
