5159751,0,t1_cv7q4df,There are actually a lot of things like wind turbine towers and blades shipped on the great lakes themselves and to the rest of the world as well. A year or so back I saw one going out of Duluth and over to Brazil and was told that was fairly common.      If you want super specific information the website  shows the boats going out and in under the beautiful Aerial lift bridge in Duluth and also lists what cargo they will be taking on andor leaving on this page ,FoggyPics,cv7xx2e,1,t5_380bt
