4412522,0,t3_3bjr1v,Mister Rogers went onstage to accept the award  and there in front of all the soap opera stars and talk show sinceratrons in front of all the jutting mantanned jaws and jutting saltwater bosoms he made his small bow and said into the microphone All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take along with me ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are. Ten seconds of silence.And then he lifted his wrist looked at the audience looked at his watch and said Ill watch the time. There was at first a small whoop from the crowd a giddy strangled hiccup of laughter as people realized that he wasnt kidding that Mister Rogers was not some convenient eunuch but rather a man an authority figure who actually expected them to do what he asked. And so they did. One second two seconds three seconds  and now the jaws clenched and the bosoms heaved and the mascara ran and the tears fell upon the beglittered gathering like rain leaking down a crystal chandelier. And Mister Rogers finally looked up from his watch and said softly May God be with you to all his vanquished children.,TheChurchOfRogers,csn0xy6,12,t5_37ga7

10843493,0,t1_ddyeb22,From what I have heard they can be pretty fun. If you ever want a laugh google  things mr welsh can no longer do in an RPG. He is awesome!Just a sample of his work . There is no Kung Fu manuever McGuire Swings For Bleachers . My thiefs battle cry is not Run And Live . Nor is it You take care of the orcs I take care of the traps . When confronted with a haunted house with bleeding walls no converting it into a self supporting blood bank. . Paladins make poor vikings. And vice versa. Have fun!,TheChurchOfRogers,ddyfhpo,3,t5_37ga7
