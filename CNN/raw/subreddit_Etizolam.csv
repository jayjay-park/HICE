10161965,0,t3_5li5il,Do you have lab test results? If not head over to retiz where HC is definitely allowed.I havent had a bad batch of Indian pellets since EtiLee and as everyone knows I was buying LOTS of etiz.   Different batches different brands etc etc   Im not a fan of etizest.   Mainly because Ive had more bad than good when it comes to etizest so for the most part I stopped buying it.   Except the stupid fucking purchase I made to East when etizolabs processor was down.   Without knowing he was taking a break until tomorrow I believe.   So Ill have a bunch of etizest.   Which isnt bad because I can compare them to the other brands and batches I have.   ,Etizolam,dbvwydx,1,t5_2zqb7

11060890,0,t1_delqasp,Yeah unfortunately im not at the point of getting big enough discounts of my etiz powders to really make anything off  per mg. Its just crazy cause people like ohmod are getting their powder for  or less and they are charging  for mg thats crazy. ,Etizolam,delqfl5,1,t5_2zqb7

11165223,0,t3_5zc80w,USPS is fine  of the time for us. But those  of the time errors are horrible for customers.USPS lost  of our orders that I know for a fact I dropped off. No movement never scanned into USPSs system but then  weeks later the majority of those customers report getting their order in the mail even though their tracking is still blank. Ill chalk that one off to the Holiday rush though.Another customer this week placed an order for the Midwest his order was express overnight and it gets sent to Puerto Rico for a day before getting rerouted back to the Midwest.Its not always the vendors fault when your order isnt arriving. The most we can do is properly pack up your order pay the correct shipping and drop it off with USPS. The rest of the delivery aspect is all up to them. Vendors dont have any control over your order when its currently in the wrong part of the country thanks to USPS. ,Etizolam,dexke5m,3,t5_2zqb7
11194915,0,t1_df0vxry,Going one day without researching no. But if youre asking if taking a break for one day will prevent withdrawals no it wont. You would need to limit your days of research to at least  days a week to keep negative effects of stopping to a minimum. Just better to be safe than risk the side effects of stopping. Again I would purchase some diclazepam to be on the safe side if you decide to take more for an extended length of time.,Etizolam,df0xhxp,1,t5_2zqb7

11655309,0,t1_dgh2dvo,So is there anything we can really do about it? I am new to etiz have only ordered  times  about a month ago from ohmod very small qty both times just to see if it worked well with my machine. No issues. Then from rchemlabs a couple weeks later. My machine is not so full up on etiz that I need  to get an analysis from the machine. I tried even more analytical research yesterday mg and analysis aproximated to maybe mg. This is very wrong and it seems he isnt willing to correct the problem. I even paid extra for overnight shipping. So  just....down the drain?,Etizolam,dgh56s5,1,t5_2zqb7
