675323,0,t1_cgfyppn,Does the STL file supply the parameters on how thick the object is? Is that something that has to be defined by the original D model currently all I have is a .obj is there a different format it has to come out to? How thick would you suggest the parts be made?,3Dprintmything,cgh1927,1,t5_2yw4p
1551038,0,t3_2byzb6,Happy to help. Is this a custom design or something from Thingiverse? Just curious if anyone else has encountered problems with the design that I should be aware of. I have red white and black Ninjaflex. What do you prefer? If you respond in the next hour or so I can print it up tonight otherwise tomorrow morning. Ill PM you with more details. ,3Dprintmything,cjap2ms,1,t5_2yw4p

9361177,0,t3_55k7er,I could give that a try in PLA but I dont think the thin walls would print well. Also the little edge at the end of the two inner clips would very likely be too thick or even missing on the finished part. The usual FDM D printing is not precise enough If working with standard .mm nozzle sizes. Ill try your model but can not promise anything.,3Dprintmything,d92lhta,2,t5_2yw4p

10277105,0,t3_5n14m5,Would you be open to having these printed from PLA? Theyd be a cheaper compared to the PETG and itd be enough to get you on your feet until you can reprint some of the heatsensitive parts. ,3Dprintmything,dc8yroj,1,t5_2yw4p
