367028,0,t3_1yai6b,Rembrandt suits are made in New Zealand which actually has quite the suitmaking industry. The wool used is serviceable it will certainly hold up. Everything is fused not sure whether you care about this. Halfcanvassing is the main benefit of MJ Bale.In terms of fit as youve probably noticed Rembrandt favours an English style cut with padded shoulders a low gorge and a good length jacket. If you or your groomsmen already have large shoulders this cut could make you look very boxy. The lapels are too skinny for my taste but this is hardly restricted to Rembrandt. The MJ Bale lapels are too skinny on many of the Classics collection as well.Overall if you and your groomsmen are happy with it you could do worse but you could also do better. If price is the main issue well if you can get Rembrandt suits for quite a bit less than  each then go ahead. But if youre close to that or over Im not actually sure of the RRP for Rembrandt go MJ Bale or better. MJB will almost definitely look better and hold up longer. If youyour groomsmen are going to be spending a bit of cash on a suit youd want them to get something they can keep and wear again.Alternatively get your groomsmen Rembrandt suits and get yourself something nicer. Its your day not theirs.,AustralianMFA,cfit391,2,t5_2u5fg

1951156,0,t3_2gzv2g,Firstly the most important thing is finding the right fit. Check out the MFA sidebar guides for shirt and pants fitting guides. For shirts look at white and light blue oxford cloth buttondowns Uniqlo Ralph Lauren Charles Tyrwhitt T.M. Lewin Brooks Brothers solid colour polo shirts navy white black and then start to delve into chambray and patterns plaid floral madras. My favourite way to wear a shirt is long sleeves with the sleeves rolled to just before the elbow.For shoes look at Sperry Topsiders my favourite colour is Sahara Clarks Desert Boots sand or beeswax colours and white sneakers Converse Vans etc.Put on a simple watch Timex Weekender Seiko  and you have yourself a complete outfit. ,AustralianMFA,ckobgh8,1,t5_2u5fg

2362371,0,t1_cm3ooxt,I agree with the your judgement on the watch. The cuffs however are understandable seeing how theyre tight fits and the shoe shaft comes up to push the cuff too. A slightly larger leg opening would improve this but I think OP thinks theyre too skinny to want to go much larger.Overall it does look like a quickly decided outfit but the qualms are either slight and fixable or they are such that compromises might not be desireable.,AustralianMFA,cm3p6vu,4,t5_2u5fg

They will run you  aud.I dont know what your budget is like but any old black dress shoe will work really. If you are interested in Royal Republiq they have basically the same shoe with a raised heel for the same price.Not a derby shoe but it is on sale Otherwise just go grab anything that looks similar to that and youll be fine. I personally own the Testa i linked in my OP and wear the shit out of them to work or out to bars and stuff.

5442006,0,t3_3phepf,The two hardest things to deal with when buying quality boots in Australia is sizing and international shipping costs.The easiest but maybe old way to mitigate these problems is trying on a pair in a shoe shop in Australia and then ordering it from overseas when there is a sale this requires patients sometimes months of waiting. I did this over a period of  months late last year.All prices include shipping and are in AUD. Keep in mind these were purchased last year at about AUDUSD parityRed Wing    Tried these on in a Melbourne store too big went ahead and ordered them from a Canadian ebay seller with a coupon half a size down.Iron Ranger in Copper Rough and Tough  Purchased on Amazon applied a sale coupon and qualified for special shipping or something. I knew my Red Wing size from trying on the s.Chippewa  Apache steel cap work beaters  Purchased on Amazon. Sized up from the Red Wings based on the advice of other Red Wing and Chippewa owners.Chippewa Service Boot in crazy horse  !Purchased a few weeks ago new from a local seller on Grailed for a bargain knowing my Chippewa size.With the current exchange rate I think Id save time and purchase from local sellers.
