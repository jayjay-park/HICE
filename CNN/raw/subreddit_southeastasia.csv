You have paved roads killer climbs and technical trails. Basically everything youre looking for is there. If you dont get the chance to visit that part of the world I suggest you go to Doi SuthelPui in Chiang Mai Thailand. This one is more oriented for downhill though but plenty of fun. Might be of help when it comes to handling skills as well. This place has  different routes that ranges from beginner trails all the way to advanced tracks. If Im not in NZ riding my bike youll probably find me riding around this place. Oh and did I mention that theres a spot here m above sea level?,southeastasia,d0len5l,1,t5_2vc85
