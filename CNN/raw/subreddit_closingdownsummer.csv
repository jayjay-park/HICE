11493887,0,t3_642avu,I find horror pretty difficult to write and I really need an image or moment that Im working around for it to happen. This one was the image of a teeth monster also courtesy of Syfys series Candle Cove and the lovecraftian vibe of a dark power that required sacrifice. I finished writing it feeling unsettled so hopefully you did too.,closingdownsummer,dfytxk0,1,t5_3jvis
