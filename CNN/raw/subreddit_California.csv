He has nothing to sue for and the cost of suing him for future payments was far more money than I could imagine. All I got was  and my life is still screwed up beyond belief.At the time I was working fulltime retail manager supporting myself. The insurance money didnt even cover half of the wages I lost in a year. And as for the medical bills Im still increwing them. By October  I lost my job due to my inability to return due to my injuries I lost my health insurance not long after since I could no longer afford the COBRA payments. For  years I got lost in the shuffle of Obamacare and had no choice but to wait for the program to actually start. Luckily for me I had a wonderful fiancee at the time and he picked up the slack. We scratched the traditional wedding we had planned for  and eloped in October . Weve had to relocate and move  hours away from our families because we could not afford the area on  income. I am still battling Social Security for my disability benefits that I worked so hard for. I never imagined I would need them so early in my adult life.As far as the medical bills go they are still piling up. I have gone without treatment because I cannot afford it.

Id check out Mono lake Mammoth Mount Whitney if you can get the permits in time Hell if youre over on the southeast side of CA might check out Vegas for a night if you have the time.After Yosemite just explore the city. Theres a thousand different things to do and sights to see. I recommend checking out the Zietgiest bar in the Mission District. Has a great outdoor beer garden and the cheapest beer in SF. You can also burn there without worrying.Highway  is a great drive too with good camping around Big Sur and the surrounding areas. Also check out Santa Cruz to glimpse the Redwoods.How long are you staying? California can be a big place if youre not used to driving  hours a day. ,California,ciayeun,2,t5_2qhsz

I got my permit at the earliest possible age . at the time got Drivers Ed during High School and drove around with my parents as much as possible. There was a requirement for a certain number of hours with a driving instructor but I cant recall how many it was  doesnt sound out of the realm of possibility.We were required to get a learners permit which allows you to drive provided you have a licensed driver over  in the vehicle with you. I believe we had to have that for  months before we were allowed to take the behindthewheel test.Shortly after I got my license they implemented the  year provisional requirement. If memory serves it was  months no driving with passengers unless accompanied by a licensed driver over  followed by additional  months no driving after dark unless accompanied by a licensed driver over  these may not apply since you are over .Rates for the invehicle driving instructor i believe this was the  hour part can vary but caveat emptor if it seems too good to be true it probably isnt true.If you dont pass the behindthewheel test you can take it again but not for a specified period of time at the same DMV location I believe we were able to go to a different one and retake it the following day but this may have changed. I think it was either  hours or  days.As a note I dont believe this is mentioned in the drivers handbook but it really should be. When you sign for your drivers license you are agreeing to Implied Consent. You can and should read this section of the California Vehicle Code to familiarize yourself with what this means and determine if you still want your drivers license link You are also required to show your license registration and proof of insurance ifwhen you are legitimately pulled over for an infraction.I hope this helps you out!,California,cku8lro,1,t5_2qhsz

The California Alliance for Arts Education Candidate Survey Project invites all local school board candidates to go on record with their views about the role of arts education in local schools. The results published a few weeks before the election give the public a way to learn more about candidates views before they vote.The survey asks them four simple but revealing questions What meaningful experiences with the arts visual arts dance drama andor music did you have growing up? What role do you think the arts can play in supporting key education priorities such as closing the achievement gap reducing the dropout rate and preparing more students for college eligibility and the st century workforce? If elected how will you promote the role of arts education in meeting the eight new priorities for the States Local Control Funding Formula? In keeping with the State Education code each school district is to provide every K student with a standardsbased comprehensive arts education. In addition the arts are critical for developing job skills vital in the creative economy and the st century workforce. If elected how will you promote the role of arts education in a complete education for students?School board elections are now more important than ever!

3742447,0,t1_cqiiiy4,Part gtThere have never been any longterm doubleblind placebo control studies of vaccines either individually or as the entire US schedule. In studies of vaccines in humans vaccines are compared with earlier versions of vaccines as the placebo and never a saline solution. Longterm doubleblind placebo controlled studies are the gold standard for proving medical safety and vaccines are the only medical treatment you can receive in a US hospital that has never undergone that testing. This is the only study I can find of the US vaccine schedule that uses a placebo control group. It was done in infant macaques and found signficantly altered amygdala development in the group receiving vaccines. It was never pursued and clearly shows the abysmal state of research and the desperate need for further investigation.I actually love this part of his post a lot because it shows how illinformed he is.  Infants wouldnt be able to undergo a placebocontrolled study for the same reason they dont work on animals  they are ignorant of what treatment and prevention are. The placebo effect which is what is tested in a placebocontrolled study is a psychophysiological response predicated on the individual receiving the sham treatment thinking they are getting the actual treatment. Due to ethical concerns there never will be a placebocontrolled study for vaccines that are not novel. Medications in general dont always undergo true placebo trials. Instead they are tested against alreadyexisting medications. When someone is suffering from an illness it is completely unethical to give them a sugar pill instead of some form of treatment.Here is what the WHO says about placebos   I cant wait to hear you call me a shill for using the WHOIm already laughing at the thoughtFirst Informed consent is necessary. Using children in placebocontrolled studies is already an ethically shaky idea to begin with but withholding a preventive measure in an infant is even more so.Second the study must be based on sound scientific rationale and must be socially valuable and use scientifically valid methods. Vaccines work  there is  years of evidence showing that they work so the rationale to use a placebocontrolled study for vaccines is not there.Third The research must have a riskbenefit profile judged to be favorable based on sufficient evidence from previous clinical and nonclinical studies. Since vaccine work and we know they work there is no riskbenefit reward from conducting a placebocontrolled trial on vaccines. If you want titers go get a vaccine and then have the titers drawntheyll show antibodies against the antigen unless you are one of the rare few who does not have an immune response to the vaccine.Fourth The benefits and burdens of the research must be justly distributed. For example research must not be carried out on vulnerable populations for the benefit of more advantaged populations. You cant get any more vulnerable than an infant so placebocontrolled studies wouldnt be conducted on infants to satisfy the whims of some vaccine deniers who are ignorant of the science behind vaccines.Fifth Should an intervention be proven efficacious in a trial research sponsors and other collaborators such as national or local governments have a duty to make provisions to ensure reasonable access to the intervention by the population from which the research participants were drawn. So as you most certainly already know vaccines work so the infants would be vaccinated anyways.Since vaccines work placebocontrols would never be used instead when a new vaccine formulation is created for an already existing vaccine I.e. a new formulation of the MMR vaccine it is tested against vaccines already in use.Placebocontrolled studies are only acceptable in two circumstances..and they BOTH need to be applicable to the vaccineFirst no effective vaccine exists such as is the case with the Ebola and Maleria vaccines being worked on.Second The vaccine under consideration is intended to benefit the population in which the vaccine is to be tested. So a vaccine placebocontrolled trial to benefit the whims of vaccine denier clearly fails on these two points.Moving on the WHO states that vaccines are never acceptable whenFirst an effective or partially effective and safe vaccine exists and is currently accessible in the public health system of the country in which the trial is planned. So there goes your idea about using a placebocontrolled trial to test vaccines already in use.Second The risk to participants of not receiving the current vaccine cannot be mitigated adequately. Considering there are epidemics of pertussis and mumps in many regions of the US and a measles outbreak as well the risks cannot be adequately mitigated to ensure placeboreceiving infants wouldnt contract these horrendous diseases.Calling for placebocontrolled studies for alreadyexisting vaccines is a joke that vaccine deniers like to play. In short it shows their lack of understanding of ethics medicine and science.No this is not a bureaucratic argument as you are going to point out.  To call ethical guidelines bureaucratic is ridiculous. Youre writing off the guidelines that ethicsreview board follow. You either dont know or at ignoring the fact that all research studies must be approved by an ethics review board. Youre essentially calling for infants to be potentially harmed by denying them a vaccine. Why would any evidence ethics review board ever approve this sort of experiment to prove something thats already been overwhelmingly proven  vaccines work and vaccines are safe.,California,cqiv3ob,6,t5_2qhsz

The agricultural industry also uses contractors so that the big ag companies can avoid liability by claiming they dont know their field workers are illegal immigrants. Using contractors also helps companies avoid liability when their employees get injured or killed on the job a construction worker might be ordered to do something on the job by a boss who technically works company A that hired the workers company B that results in him becoming permanently disabled.

I guess physicists really are bananas.In other fun trivia heres a tidbit that would probably get conspiracists heads spinning if it was mentioned in an article on ENENewsgt  K is the largest source of natural radioactivity in animals including humans. A  kg human body contains about  grams of potassium hence about .    . grams of  K whose decay produces about  disintegrations per second becquerels continuously throughout the life of the body.You hear that sheeple? All this talk about bananas is just a plot to distract us from the fact that the NWO has poisoned all of humanity with nuclear radiation! Put together thats  trillion becquerels of radioactivity almost as much as what TEPCO dumped into the ocean! On a more serious note I tried to be consistent and only compared the  K decay rates between bananas and seawater.  K decays to  Ar plus a gamma ray and neutrino so water doesnt offer all that much protection.  You probably wouldnt see much difference from the gamma rays emitted from  lbs of banana inside or outside your body vs. swimming in your bodys weight in water.

5989726,1,t1_cy4rqwl,Ive said theres been a strong push for no waiting periods because the gun lobby and the people pushing back against those waiting period state that it doesnt reduce violence and with even less data to back them up doesnt prevent suicides.   This implies they would have totally been for these limits on their freedoms if they could be proven to be helpful.  Except their lawyers implied the opposite that access to gun is more important than evidence showing that less people would die if regulations were in place.Theres counterdata that says it does reduce impulsive violence and gun violence from the mentally ill and does reduce overall suicides.   But it doesnt matter because thats not really the argument you or the gun lobby used to get rid of waiting periods in different courts across the country.Its even more difficult since its so difficult to get any gun research funded.  In fact theres a lot of effort in play to silence any gun death research that has been funded. As this conversation makes clear we are not interested in being responsible or sober about gun ownership.    A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.The lack of a  hour waiting period as the gun lobby has so strenuously and vigorously fought for is an indication of the sobriety and rigor with which our populace takes its duty to create a well regulated militia.   Except we all know that it has nothing to do with anyone creating a well regulated militia and everything to do with expanding gun sales and padding profits to those selling weapons.

We could outsource for a while but eventually we would have to deal with these problem people and that is a massive undertaking.  We just need to clean up DOJ eliminate corruption cut the ties to the ACLUs love affair with organized crime and just fix these ridiculous problems.

That does not include taxes and surcharges which will be another  per ticket so now were up over .Yes they will have pricing schemes but the plan is clearly to compete with airfare kids dont travel free. The  is not the baseline its the bottom line....or cheapest fare available under best of circumstances.  Last minute fares will be might higher refundable fares will be higher etc.  And you also have to figure everything the HSR Authority says is lies.  Costs are underexaggerated and benefits are overexaggerated. People dont take their families on long trips across the state very often.  Maybe once or twice a year so your assumption that paying  for a frequent traveler discount is false.  Again you are also not accounting for the fact that once I get to the train terminal I still have to get to get around town.  Im not going to haul my kids and all our stuff on local public transportation.  You obviously dont have kids.  When we travel in the minivan the van is completely full and we even have a rooftop luggage carrier.So basically your point is that if the US were to completely redesign our development policies around public transportation then HSR will work.

If youre suggesting we implement this program just so motorcycle users can save a few dollars a year I would suggest that its much more trouble than its worth.Also the more complex they make it the more bureaucracy will be required to implement it and the less money that is collected will actually go to the roads.No matter how you try to spin it a mileage tax benefits no one except the government workers hired to implement and manage it.

So the more we spend on healthcare the more we get a bunch of bonus money to spend on healthcare. This tax isnt permanent but since  we vote to extend it every time it comes up four times so far. Prop  just makes the tax permanent. It also requires voter approval if they want to use the money for anything else. Its pretty much just an informal law that were now formalizing.P.S.

10287381,0,t1_dc6ugqu,The debt is truly an issue that the U.S. needs to get its head around.  We here in California have started fixing our problem with debt paying off  Billion from the first decade of this century.  While we have taken steps to fix our pension issues more needs to be done.  Especially with PERS.  Playing with the debt ceiling has an immediate effect on our credit rating and the world banking sector.  While I agree that none of want to pass along the debt we inherited from our parents to our kids there is a difference in the speed that consequences will be felt.Totally agree but I fear you are in the minority.  There has been intentional blending of the idea of the Religious Marriage and the Legal one.  As for Santorums diatribes well he is a Republican politican.  Someone can tell him to STFU.I see them as very similar.  The arguments against Gay Marriage at the Supreme Court were reduced to can they have kids?  While the legal justification was different for the South the comparison is the same.  If all people are equal then why does the gender or race matter?The War on Drugs really is a question of Constitutional interpretation.  The last time we outright banned a drug Alcohol we added a Constitutional Amendment.  So if that war the burden before why can we criminalize a molecule without one.  BTW Saying exactly that will get you bounced from the jury pool in every drug case.  Ill add that the Courts to not find the Interstate Commerce clause as an effective argument or they would have already shut down Colorados Legalization efforts thanks Nebraska for finding that out.Completely disagree these are Americans.  All they want is the right to be treated equally under the law.  I do hope you see that.  They get a significant number of people who are weirded out by them.  And then those people say How do I calm myself down about this?  I know Ill pass a law making their lives tougher.  Add some hysterics and boom its a major talking point.Just wait a few more weeks and youll see States rights shattered.  A war on Porn and a war on Weed are coming.  Not because they can be won but because they can be fought.  Beyond that full GOP control will lead to a few things higher taxes for most people continued pressure on abortion rights further weakening of regulations especially on banking a significant increase in debt beyond Obama and repeal of the New Deal.  Winning races isnt the point of politics.  Control and power arent the point of politics.  Politics is about building a society that we all wish to live in by discussing things with each other and coming to consensus.  We havent been talking in sometime.  Worse people out their believe crazy things because they get their news from bad places or are so desperate for help theyll vote for anything.

11054345,0,t1_dejjjyf,gtIf prop  is repealed I have family mostly elderly on fixed income that will be homeless. have to sell their homes and become millionaires and go live someplace appropriate to their actually very comfortable means.None of what you describe is good. This is just like any other rich person complaining that taxes make them poor you have to have a big pile of money or a very valuable asset to have a high tax bill friend. If the current value of your family members homes would create such an insanely high tax bill that they would be unable to pay then they would SELL their homes and get a TON of money the huge sum that created the high prop tax bill. You have to have the windfall of appreciation to have the burden of taxes. It might be BETTER if your family really is on a fixed income for them to access the  figures of equity in their house. But you and I both know that they were all counting on the passthru to leave that  figures taxfree to their family. If yall have to pay taxes perhaps there would be the increased political will to build more housing to keep your prices steady and your taxes affordable. If yall had to pay taxes maybe your younger family members would have a path to home ownership besides waiting for your other family members to damn die and leave you a tax shelter of a house. Your property taxes are a percentage of the value of your house. If the tax bill is huge the value of the house is huge. If your family is retired and on a fixed income its not doing much economic good for them to live where all the jobs are where people with  incomes are all trying to afford to live with all their wealth bound up in a tiny house. Selling a shitty santa clara bungalow gives you a comfortable rest of your life in Arizona with travel and health care taken care of completely. There is no reason for a retired pensioner to be sitting in Silicon Valley fighting against adding the housing that working people need and bitching about the notion of having to pay property taxes someday. No. My landlord gets prop  but i have no rent control. Fuck that. Hes an old man i bet he characterizes himself as on a fixed income because he has to wait for leases to end before jacking up the rent again. please no to that.,California,dekzp3m,0,t5_2qhsz

Honestly I hope someone runs. Not becauses I want them to win but rather I want them to lose  I think a serious run by a leftprogressive would be good to show folks where the state actually is in terms of what they want in their representatives.Personally I think Feinstein is a great senator because she takes her job as a legislator seriously. We have lots of Senators who vote the Dem line perfectly well. Introduce pie in the sky bills that wont go anywhere.It takes work to gets legislation through Senate. Not only does a Senator need to ensure that it will have broad support within the State but they need to make sure it has enough support in the country  and the country aint California.I will say that her vote for the Iraq War is something that bothers me.

Her husband had cancer chemo ate their savings he died and the house was foreclosed all within a few months. People in those situations rarely have the wherewithal to move across the street let alone across the country.  Yea I get u. Theres those situations.

The problem is fully legalizing drugs that are addictive wont be good for the people that are addicted right now. Taking the proper steps to get to legalization is first medically legalizing it to choke out the black market and by creating a clean black market by second hand sellers. gtThe problem with big pharma is our politicians are taking money and in turn pushing our regressive drug laws onto other countries in order to sell pills on our articicially monopolized market.

We still have a few years of appreciation to go before being at peak and even in the mid s rates are still historically low.Also note that when interest rates do go up to historically normal interest rates of  or so thats going to push a bunch of people out of the homebuying market and keep them as tenants. As a landlord this is excellent news more tenants  higher demand  more rent. If I intend to hold for one real estate cycle or more longterm rental income level matters far more than shortterm appraised value levels.I stumbled into getting good at doing landlords mortgages because everyone else sucks at it if you want to be successful in any industry figure out what everyone else in that industry is bad at and that segment of my business has actually picked up in the last month or so as experienced landlords seem to be betting on rates continuing to go up thus pulling up rents.You can start a cash out refinance get it appraised and approved and everything float the rate go house hunting for your purchase lock both rates the day you go into contract on the purchase and close both real estate transactions concurrently. Like a contingent on sale offer but without the possibility of some random buyer flaking on you and screwing up your purchase... its you so its not contingent on sale its contingent on you closing your own dang cash out refinance that has already been approved. ,California,df2yt6i,1,t5_2qhsz
