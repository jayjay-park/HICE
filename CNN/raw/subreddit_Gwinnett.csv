639138,0,t3_21ezwg,This is hilarious.  If you lived in a third world country not only would you not have a dog or a lawn or anything youd just shoot or beat the lady instead of this passiveaggressive bullshit.  Obviously Im just trying to impart some perspective.... just cut the bullshit and tell her matter of fact youve observed her and the dog and its disgusting and you want her to pick it up or go far far away from your yard.  Stop pretending to be polite  you can be firm and resolute without being threatening.  This where are your bags? nonsense is weak. ,Gwinnett,cgcx5na,0,t5_2tvgr
