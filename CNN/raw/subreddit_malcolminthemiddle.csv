Sure in television it is not always necessary for a show to be good in order for it to be successful look at the reality television which we are now subjected to but in the case of MITM I believe that was the case.,malcolminthemiddle,cfcp0r4,1,t5_2t9hp

3708290,0,t1_cqesblg,I think her Malcolm and Francis could all be narcissists.  They always look at other peopleexternal forces as if they are the problem never themselves.  They believe that their morality is superior to everyone elsesExamples include when Lois wont admit she was at fault for a car accident despite overwhelming evidence.  Malcolm when he creates a sims family.  Francis when he goes into AA even though he doesnt drink.

7534647,0,t1_d2xftiq,gt How would House of Cards or Justified work if every new episode threw out the consequences of the previous?Firstly those arent sitcoms. Sitcom  situation comedy. Secondly there are tons of shows that focus on overarching continuity and dont maintain episode to episode continuity shows like Malcolm in the Middle while some disregard continuity entirely Seinfeld and Always Sunny being notable examples. Malcolm in the Middle does have consequencesdevelopments from previous episodes. For example when Hal and Larry drunkenly demolish Hal and Lois bedroom wall there are following episodes that touch on this such as Garage Sale and Day Care. Development with recurring characters such as Craig having his house burn down or Kitty leaving Abe and Stevie also shows sequential continuity. Malcolm in the Middle isnt a show that requires complete continuity to thrive. It isnt a show about how every action needs a reaction shown to the audience. Its a show that thrives because of the various crazy shenanigans and situations the family put themselves into.  ,malcolminthemiddle,d2yni1a,4,t5_2t9hp

9619563,0,t3_5crqhs,Another clue is the fact that Trump attended Military school just like Francis. Donalds brother Frederick Jr who died of Alcoholism. FrederickFrancis  Link related to election.Donald Trump reportedly has an IQ of  Malcolm . They were both in the gifted class at school. Malcolm starts playing a game called The Virts where he recreates himself and his family. Lois becomes Supreme Court Justice Trumps sister is Judge of theUS District Court for the District of New Jersey appointed by Bill Clinton. In S E the boys stick Dewey with babysitting Jamie. Dewey tells Jamie an elaborate story in which their parents are secretly wealthy and have a hidden secret good house in their closet. Malcolm decides to publish a students brilliant story in the school newsletter despite its vulgar language. After the ALCU forces him to not censor the story Principal Block decides to cancel all extracurricular activities rather than turning their high school into an adult bookstore. They even blackmail him with threatening the student to be expelled if he doesnt comply. He gets revenge on Block by publishing his own magazine just outside the school grounds  m away from the gates also containing the story. Not unfamiliar to Trump and his issues with the media.Malcolm alters the vandalism into a womens rights protest to avoid a punishment which sparks a colossal media circus. In no time feminists conservative religious groups and national news reporters descend on the scene. Womens rights protest a common topic with Trump duringafter this election campaign. Lois and Hal visit Francis to help him celebrate one year of sobriety but when they attend hisAAmeeting they find out that he never really was an alcoholic he blamed his psychological problems on nonexistent drinking which he has blamed Lois for.As previously mentioned Frederick Trump Jr apparently died of Alcoholism.In the last episode the boys destroy their nuclear option evidence of the worst thing they ever did fake anXRayof Lois havingcancerto sneak away with bad report cards. Donalds uncle John G. Trump a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technologyfrom  to  was involved in radar research for the Allies in WWII helped design Xray machines that provided additional years of life to cancer patients. The nuclear option aka President.Malcolm Wilkersonborn  is the main protagonist of the series. He is shown to have a rather unjustified superiority complex believing he deserves a much better life than hes got though much of his misfortunes he brings upon himself.BiographyMalcolm Wilkerson is a hopelessly miserable and annoyed kid who lives a very crappy life. Hes a social outcast and spends most of his spare time alone growing very selfabsorbed and egotistical. His lack of friends and popularity is mostly due to his parents and home situation as well as his own ego and need for fairness and truth. A heavy example of this is in the episode Malcolm Holds His Tongue in which he gets kicked off his basketball team for stating the noticeable flaws in his coachs game plan and thus attempts to keep his thoughts to himself only to get a peptic ulcer by the end after continually listening to what people had to say and not speaking his mind.Malcolm was shown to have an IQ of  placing him in the exceptionally gifted section of the IQ chart making him a genius. Malcolms intelligence allows him to remember things such as a large series of numbers and is able to multiply divide and perform all other kinds of mathematical operations all in his head and without even needing to write it down or use any kind of memory. However Malcolm never gets any respect in society even though he is a genius because like he alwayscalls thingsunfair which is a recurring theme in the show. Malcolms ingeniousness doesnt work his brain is being rushed. So if Malcolms in a bad situation where hes told to think fast the outcome is always going to be a pretty bad idea. This was seen at its worst in Poker  where Malcolm had the idea to steal a loaded gun from a girl who was illegaly carrying one lock it in inside of a tire jack so that she wouldnt be able to get it back which resulted in the gun being shot into the house and it wasnt until after that that he decided to call the police. Upon telling a cop the story the cop called Malcolm out on his alleged exceptionally gifted intelligence level believing it to be false. This could be one of the reasons why nobody respects Malcolms ingeniousness. A lot of people think Trump is an idiot he is clearly not. This character description basically completely matches Trump. Donald impressed his classmates with his athleticism and wild shenanigans. But he also had a penchant for pigheadedness and even then refused to acknowledge his mistakes. He was known even at such a young age for saying anything that came into his head. This one is similar to Malcolm. While Malcolm is for most part extremely unpopular with girls he has had a number of girlfriends throughout the show. However they all end in an extremely unhappy fashion. Either because of Lois who plans to choose who he marries for him or Malcolms own actions. A couple of divorces for Malcolm Trump then?Theres an episode in S where Hal actually says the word Trumps.Throughout the series Malcolms intellect has proven to be more of a burden then a blessing as he is the person the family usually turns to when faced with a crisis. This was shown when Hal refused to let Malcolm go to an out of country school Malcolm tried to use it to escape his family. Hal said he was the familys last hope. His genius is also the reason Lois tries to completely control his life as she believes Malcolm is the only one of her children with a chance of amounting to anything. Many episodes show Malcolm struggling to get out Loiss control. But all his efforts prove to be in vain.To touch on the final episode again it is revealed thatHal and Loisdo not plan for him to have an easy life. Because Malcolm consistently exceeds his parents expectations by both his intellect his character and sense of ethics by the time he graduates from high school they have the highest of expectations for him that he will become President of the United States. Pursuant to this instead of letting Malcolm take a sixfigure salary job out of high school his parents force him to follow through on plans to attend college as part of an elaborate plan for his future. Lois says that at Harvard Malcolm will have to work harder than his classmates and will accomplish more than they do but they will continue to look down upon him. When Malcolm argues that he could have taken the job and bought his way into office Lois concludes that Malcolm wouldnt have suffered enough though he has suffered his whole life.. Because of the struggles hes forced to endure Malcolm will realize that there is more to life than flaunting how intelligent he is. After college the plan provides for him to channel his energies into a political career and after starting off as a district attorney or running a foundation he will be elected governor of a midsize state and then President. They envision that he would then become one of the greatest Presidents ever because he would represent understand and more importantly show empathy with the interests of people like his family which his parents say no other President has. Though seems unlikely given Malcolms selfishness You could argue that Trump has essentially bought his way into office. Theres countless references throughout the show that I cant think of right now. The dialogue backs this entire theory up. The things the characters do and say in the show are laced with subliminal messaging. Hals dad is Walter Wilkerson. He is very rich. Francis IM CONFUSED! ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE YEARS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE OR SHIPPING ME OFF TO MILITARY SCHOOL!?Malcolm is going through Eds undeleted emails with Reese and Stevie and learns about his affair with half of the women in their neighborhood Malcolm Heres one from old Mrs. Swanbeck.Stevie Open the picture attachment. Malcolm opens the picture attachment and he is disgusted along with Reese and Stevie. Ed has just learned about Reese reading his undeleted emails from his affair with the other women.Ed Oh my god how much do you know?Reese Everything. You might want to formulate your megabytes next time you get rid of your computer. Oh and by the way Mrs. Swanbeck You are sick!Ed Keep your voice down Email scandal during Trump v Clinton along with the man cheating on his wife with all these women.

10444655,0,t1_dcl8icb,gt Okay first of all that came out of no where.No it didnt. The author spent a large portion of the article talking about the political messages in Malcolm in the Middle. It makes sense to end by talking about the show in the context of current politics.gt Second what the hell does that mean? Trumps barely stepped foot in the oval officeTrump has made promises about what his administration will do. Its reasonable to make some predictions about what will happen.,malcolminthemiddle,dcrzhgv,3,t5_2t9hp
