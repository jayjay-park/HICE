And that Franklin play was amazing to not only leap over the camera guys but also do so with keeping a foot inbounds and then touch the ball before landing out.

We couldnt have this conversation about any other place of worship in town including the synagogues. I know what Antioch does and I know it isnt logical or found in the bible. No endorsement can change that. I think the fact that the feel the need to have such a page on their website is revealing. I dislike the church because they are cult that spreads heretical beliefs and negatively impacts peoples lives. I define them as a cult because.Their beliefs are far outside of the mainstream. No large christian denomination practices in a similar manner..They are insular. They believe other Christians are lesser and need their special brand of salvation..They are secretive. They wont own up to their practices..They aggressively recruit in a way incompatible with genuine godinspired faith. I have personally been lied to multiple times in attempts to get me to come to lifegroup. Other people have shared similar stories.I have had multiple friends go to Antioch. None of them have currently attend or attended for more than a year. All of them left for they same reasons I consider them to be a cult.,baylor,cpd7eia,5,t5_2sg0d

This means that whenever an employer deems that you have acted in such a way that is inappropriate they can terminate your employment.As for the proof the report that was released to the public was not the same one that was presented to the Regents.  That report had specifics removed both in terms of specific circumstances and identities in order to prevent a lawsuit for libelslander.  Pepper Hamilton gave a full report to the Regents prior to the Regents taking action.  If Briles and Starr had not been implicated in a severe way the university would have stuck by them.  Regardless neither Baylor nor the Board of Regents needs to prove this in court.

Ive seen this up close and personal with a good friend who was raped by a powerful person not at Baylor and not at a university. She received direct threats on her safety and also a constant barrage of assurances that her rapists organization would ruin her life if she went to trial shed be made out in court to be a whore. They even threatened to bring her mothers sexual history into the trial. And they told her theyd be suing her for defamation and that they would bankrupt her and her family draining them of all resources with an array of civil suits.She only went to the police after she realized that her rapist had offended before and had never been held accountable. But even then it was the hardest decision she ever made. The trial was hell but the guy was convicted. The trial took so much time and effort that she had to drop out of school and quit her job for more than a year just to properly assist the prosecutors.There are still people who think shes the bad guy and that she ruined a good mans career. Shes been the victim of an unusual number of property crimes vandalism theft  that she believes as do I are retribution for reporting.So while it would be best if everyone could muster the resources and strength to report not everyone can do so.
