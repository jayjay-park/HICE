Then drive that distance at a constant speed. Make sure you time when you start and stop and stop when you have reached the second point.

With these points in foreword i will continue.Your first paragraph is a nullified relevancy because it is purely opinion and not based on any kind of observation thus the logic is not true.Your second paragraph is another nullified relevancy because it does not rebut my original statistical data real explorers were real observers and through both actions obtained real results regardless of which creatures in existence believed them.Unfortunately your argument is flawed in its basis of logic because your logic is purely theoretical and it is in fact you that has provided no evidence or data.My original comment includes wellknown humans who are recorded to have existed at one point in history.

10540233,0,t1_dd24xaf,No its okay. I was just letting you know because religious generally refers to a manmade effort. Christianity isnt like the worlds religions because God is the instigator rather than man. In the case of x religion man guesses many things like... who God is and what he wants and what man must do to earn some sort of favorable afterlife. Christianity is the opposite because God revealed himself and salvation is a free gift. Man doesnt have to do anything except believe and receive this free gift rather than reject it.The reason the questions are difficult for your girlfriend to answer is because it deals with metaphysics which is not something that one can simply show you physically. But God also plays a part in the process as an active agent rather than simply an object of theoretical faith. God confirms to us the facts which the Bible professes. The process feels like intuition. And so passing this on to others doesnt always or even usually work because it requires a cooperation with God to reach a persons heart. It is not the Christians job to convince anyone... It is merely their job to convey the message. God does the rest.So why did I believe in something there is no concrete proof for? Again because the spirit of God confirmed it to me. Like literally I could read parts of the Bible before and it made no sense. But there was a point where suddenly it was as easy to understand as a childrens book. It was a supernatural shift. Something which cannot be explained in a purely material world. After this I began to notice many extremely unlikely coincidences which seemed to be one way God was confirming certain things to me. Because Im a technical person  an analyst at heart this was the most relatable means to prove the truth to me. It is different for other people probably depending on their personality. I needed something more concrete. And I understand probability quite well. When I see something with a million to one odds against happening over and over again I understand that this is witnessing God messing with the natural flow of the universe. Things are not merely left unguided. It is possible to see the hand of God shaping events and people and the whole universe if you pay attention and line up your observations with the claims of scripture. Its pretty amazing once youre aware of it.gtwe have a lot of verifiable information and data that contradicts what is in the biblethe general view of christianityWell you may think that is true but usually this is merely people who want to disprove the faith coming up with circumstances that are not conclusive. How can you use natural occurrance to disprove a supernatural thing? Ponder that for a moment. The realm of science is restricted to the material. It is reliable within its own scope but it cannot measure or observe that which is outside the physical universe.No claim of scripture has ever been disproven. Maybe cite an example and well take a look at it briefly. Though I could provide you with some websites that explain it better than I could. My perspective is rather specific. I deal with empiricism a lot as a rational logical person. But the faith is much more than what Ive perceived it to be. The big picture is pretty incredible. And dont forget that God is the author of the laws of physics. It is his prerogative to break these laws. They used to call that a miracle. So when you consider faith and facts Im curious which facts are on your mind. Remember facts are impartial. It is the conclusions we draw from those facts which are biased.Thanks for the compliments and for being such an agreeable person to talk with! Most people who question the faith are deliberately confrontational. This is refreshing.gtDo you not find it odd that god has to be worshiped for example as this seems an entirely human quality.Worship is merely an acknowledgement that something is greater than you are. And in the case of God if you truly understood his nature youd be humbled and acknowledge this yourself. To stand before the very creator of this entire universe and realize that you have his direct attention... yes if you can imagine this scenario I dont think worship would be too far off the old train tracks of thought. As for being omniscient and omnipresent this is a fascinating topic to me so I appreciate the fact that you brought it up. Though I do not understand why you called it a contradiction.What this is all about is your image of God in your mind. The reason you have trouble understanding it is because you are viewing God as a member of this universe rather than the other way around. Basically your view of God is too small. Scripture refers to him with certain properties which would be impossible to reconcile with silly things like invisible man in the sky. God is not finite like such depictions demand. I have a theological metaphysics model which explains it and reconciles the Bible with observed reality perfectly and Id be happy to share it with you over time if you wish. Ive only shared it with a few people... those who are not cynical and also who have a mind to grasp such concepts. To get you started imagine a world inside a computer simulation. Surely youve played computer games where a fully realized world is instantiated and you can interact with both the environment and other characters. Some characters are controlled by real people while others are AI controlled inside the game simulation.With this in mind ask yourself the following questions From the perspective of someone who has lived their entire life inside this simulation would they be able to have knowledge of the computer itself? If someone living in this sim were somehow sapient and could carry on a conversation with you would they not find it incredulous that you suggest that their entire universe was designed... with words... and that there was a machine which sustained every aspect of their universe continuously? The character would look at you very oddly and look around asking where this machine is. They cant see it. And they have a very hard time believing what you are saying. Surely you are delusional. Whats more you insist that this machine is simultaneously everywhere and it is all powerful and it knows everything about this universe. That there is nowhere within the simulation where you can go where you will be away from the computer. That the computer is invisible and yet is still present all powerful and all knowing. At this point the character within the simulation is balking. They simply cannot accept this combination of traits. They claim you are crazy and that there is no evidence for such a machine. They ask If this machine were real why cant you just show it to me? Why cant I see it? I want proof.You see the dilemma... The character within the simulation cannot see the actual physical computer which runs the simulation. This is how it is with us and with God. Specifically God the Father. As a further analogy Jesus Christ who is also God but known as God the Son did come to earth and make himself known to the people and reveal many things about this realm we cannot see.  You can consider this to be an avatar of sorts. God in the flesh. But more on that later if you are interested. Believe me when I say that this is all perfectly plausible and it squares biblical claims with the observable universe just fine. ,Flat_Earth,dd2up6u,1,t5_2x6r6

11158813,0,t1_derivxb,Expanding on what DethFiesta said the  Celestial Poles are Polaris and Sigma Octantis. These are stars which are close to the area of sky above the north and south poles.If our Earth is flat we should be able to see both Polaris and Sigma Octantis from any point on earth  however that is not the case. On the flat earth map draw a circle in the middle around half the diameter of Earth. Polaris if only visible if you stand inside that circle you drew and Sigma Octantis can never be seen from within that circle. Sigma Octantis is only visible from outside the circle you drew and Polaris is never seen outside that drawn circle.Theres really no reasonable explanation for this being the case on a flat earth. There are explanations of course such as Polaris and Sigma Octantis being the same star they really arent. This easily observable feature of our earth is perfectly explained on a Globe Earth where the inner circle you drew on the flat earth map is the Northern Hemisphere the half of earth north of the equator and the outer ring is the Souterh Hemisphere  the reason you cant see Sigma Octantis from the Nothern Hemisphere is because the Earth is blocking it  you cant see the sky on the other side of the globe because obvisouly the ground is in the way.,Flat_Earth,dewu8b1,1,t5_2x6r6

11396212,0,t3_62gjre,FlatEarth CreationismFlatEarth creationism states that the Earth is flat immobile and the center of the universe. It is covered by a solid domelike sky most likely referring to the second day of creation when God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament ... And God called the firmament Heaven Genesis . The stars sun and moon are embedded in this rigid dome.Modern GeocentrismModern geocentrists believe the Earth is spherical not flat but they reject almost everything else in modern astronomy viewing the Earth as the center of the universe and immobile. According to geocentrists the sun rotates around the Earth in hour periods and all other planets rotate around the sun. More mainstream geocentrists point to the theory of general relativity in physics to back up their Biblical belief noting in essence that all positions are the result of frame of reference and no frame of reference can be disputed. Radical geocentrists refer only to the Bible and reject all of modern astronomy physics and cosmology.
