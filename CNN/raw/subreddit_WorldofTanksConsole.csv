6349663,0,t1_czbdeow,The gold letters are the clear indicator. While it was an Ace Tanker he didnt do extremely well. Most likely there are very small number of people playing the tank so the average XP in the last  days isnt too high. On the other hand the player doesnt have premium so less credits.

6387439,0,t3_435li3,A very good list.A small change and additionLearn when and when not to use free XP. Do use for painful stock grinds. Do NOT use to skip tanks. And yes saving it for higher tiers is a good idea as the stock grinds get longer.Wait for sales on low tier premium tanks and garage slots they are some of the best early game purchases.Edit more tipsTry different control schemes! Most good players use either Scheme B moves cruise control to where it isnt accidentally hit or Scheme C aka battlefield style controls.Along with the above try inverted reverse.You can click the stick to zoom when aiming Yes I know this is really obvious now but some players still dont know this.,WorldofTanksConsole,czfook6,2,t5_39ysp

6671441,0,t1_d09b6cm,Main thing is if they had tried to cap the base they wouldve won and avoided losing all their tanks and the match. Even if it was  or  guys just to play safe while the others try to get us that would have been enough.They were overconfident in their numbers. Without mentioning tanks or tiers what they could have done right to get us etc the important thing is they didnt and that is because they looked to the top of the screen and saw only  guys left versus . They didnt even bother to have someone capturing to be on the safe side. That is overconfidence because we were outnumbered. Some of them may have been sloppy but thats what overconfidence does.This type of scenario where the enemy is outmatched by a great deal and still wins doesnt happen all the time but it does happen enough to maybe teach people to be more cautious about it. It happened again to me yesterday as you can see in my reply up there. What does happen more aften than outnumbered players winning the game is when people stop capping to go and look for more damage with their hyper slow tanks when they know the enemy is probably close to the base and about to start capping. They then lose the match and possibly even the tank failing to do that so much sought damage that is worth losing. But hey WN and MoE so theyre happy with the loss. What great team players they are...screwing the rest of the team.Also I dont understand why people get so mad when theres someone capping even if it is just to be on the safe side. On one side theres a guy who wants the damage mainly because stats and on the other you have a guy whos capping base for the team to make sure the team gets the win more XP silver and that one guy who just wants to deal damage gets angry because of it!?! Why are people so greedy that they feel that just because theyre after more damage for their stats the guy capping should get out of the base and receive less XP and silver possibly even lose the match in the process so that they get their stats raised? Why should the people who cap care about that or even do such a thing? If all people care is stats and no the team game in front of them then fair enough go and do it by yourself. Stop blaming others players for damage you cannot do! Get it yourself and stop blaming others!Seriously a lot of thing I read here almost sounds like its coming from people who dont really like the game. They dont like tanks other than the ones they use dont like the guns on tanks they dont use obviuously dont like people capping because said people have to worry about the stats they need raised. It seems to me like people do not like the game. It somewhow reminds of Gears of War and how Id get messages regurarly because Im not using the Gnasher because its their favourite weapon and Im the nob for using something else I like. Its just so childish other people want to have fun too you know?...Anyway I strayed a little bit from the conversation but yeah.

6760235,0,t1_d0ijnqe,gtI think it was just a dumb questionNot really. On the PC you actually have a crew member for each of those that you listed out. Heck some tanks actually had two members for the same thing for example Drivers. This meant if you wanted to transfer a tank crew from one to another you had to transfer each one but youd be hosed if you went from one tank that had  commander  driver  radio  gunner  loader into something that required the same as above but now you needed  more driver which youd have to get from another tank or a new recruit. Plus then each of these crew members gained their own experience which i believe depended on if they survived the battle.For the consoles they paired down the crew to just getting xp for the commander. Heck they even paired down the tank upgrades to packages. On the PC you could research each component individually so you could just get the gun upgrade without requiring the engine and track upgrade. Although some components wouldnt work without an upgrade such as you couldnt get the best gun without getting the upgrade to the turret and the suspension due to weight ratioissues. Think they just went this package route to make things easier to understandprogress without all the research that was required on the PC version.Heck it took some research on my part to understand that you could transfer any crew to a premium without an issue on the console. On the PC you could only transfer a TD crew to a TD premium. So youd have needed a premium of every type for one nation just to have the option of moving a crew to a premium for the additional training.So they just tried to streamline more of this work for the console than they have for the PC.,WorldofTanksConsole,d0ikckp,1,t5_39ysp

Tech tree cost is g i believe so while technically this is not a barebones bundle like we most enjoy it is straight up cheaper than buying the tank off the tech tree so the prem time really is a bonus in this case rather than padding it out to get extra money from us.FWIW as part of my visit to the wayback machine i learned that the Tier VIII Premium tank  off sale happened last November as well as last May.

Like if no one goes down heavy ally and the enemy just rush it.

Decent speed its a fairly standard German medium that earns more silver.Gorynych KV Decent allaround Russian heavy with preferential matchmaking. Good alpha and decent reload time but fairly bad aim time. Good armor if you can hide the giant weakspot on your front.,WorldofTanksConsole,d8gdsma,2,t5_39ysp

10201549,0,t3_5m1qhl,Cheers for all the replies guys been good getting an opinion on what everyone thinks is most important.Some of it doubles down on what I know Map awareness and positioning but struggle to put into practice. Knowing this is an important piece for Unis might encourage me to focus that little bit more and not go gun ho. Other things like dpm and when to try and take on an enemywhen to back off are certainly things I can work to improve too. After reading them all I think I can identify small areas where I can see what Im doing right such as seeing an enemy disappear and being able to predict his next move but then equally I know where I fall well below and that would be planning on how to counter the threat effectively. One day Ill find the time for adoption and try to string a few more of these skills together and learn some new ones at the same time.

If there was a refund calculator and I could figure out how much Id get back for owning so many of the vehicles already I might go for it. Theres really only two problems I see.. Id still need  or  gold in the first place.. The US bundle has a lot of reskins of other premiums. I dont need another T Combat Car when I already have  and while I understand the MAE Ripper is very rare its identical to the underwhelming MAE I already have. The Freedom is also identical to my Super Pershing but somehow looking like the flag threw up on it makes it worth a lot more. And the T is one of the most expensive in the game and identical to my T Black except it earns a lot less XP. As for the Germans the only reskin is the Lowe which is also the most expensive tank in the game.I really want the Mutant and the TE and TE are very rare at least until now.The only German tanks from the bundle I really lust after are the miniMaus and the B but even if I got the smaller bundles containing them Id end up with a Pz.

10508700,0,t3_5qfxji,You cant compare tanks from various classes. If you look at heavies only E absolutely shits on everything in its class. FVb has a better gun and DPM but it pays for it with awkward gun positioning and being more flammable than a . Chieftan has a great gun but it is huge and has no hull armor of any relevance. E has no weaknesses. The cupola is mm which means no one can pen it with regular ammo especially if it even has even a few degrees of angling on the ground. Ive played E on Blitz where the cupola is mm thick  and everyone can pen it  yes that is actually way too thin so I dont want Xbox E to have that same autopen tumor. But it still has to be a weakspot. The E tumor on xbox is hard to pen even with gold depending on your angles. So yes it is OP. Because it barely has any downsides. Getting ammoracked through front rollers is an operator error not a downside and you can easily avoid it. I dont want the E to be trash but it needs to be somewhat fair. Make the tumor pennable by AP from Tier X tanks with good aim so that E drivers actually have to move a little bit to avoid shots. So maybe that cupola smoothing out that PC is getting on supertest is good news. Spread those mm around so that maybe the top part of it is vulnerable etc Im making my way up the E line now just to see it for myself but facing them so far has been an incredibly frustrating experience. ,WorldofTanksConsole,dcz9tfy,2,t5_39ysp

10539856,0,t3_5qsjdn,Additional point of viewMonster Mash Retrospective Krafts Panther was fun during the Halloween mode last year. It had amazing hull armor while that event was going on. Actually if I remember correctly shells that would pen it normally still would but theyd do a fraction of the proper damage It had a speed nerf topping out at about  kph and the engine sounds were replaced by a zombielike moan. It also seems the cannon had an alpha damage buff because I remember consistently getting hits for  damage. Its real gimmick though was that it was stealthy. It was completely invisible to the UI. You didnt show up on the minimap even to your allies and when someone put their cursor on you it didnt show any info. But after a day of Revenant OP plz nerf this mode sux the cat came out of the bag about how the game actually treated them. You were constantly spotted even if nobody could see you. If you hit autoaim on the random tank hulls strewn about it would work and lock on if that was really an enemy skulking about. Also the always spotted but not on the UI schtick had another disadvantage for the poor Kraft drivers. You could just randomly hit the target this enemy button and find a Revenant hiding on the other side of the map even if nobody else was around it and it would have been hidden during a regular game. There were still  or  of these in every match and it was probably still the best of the bunch but people knew what to do about them after the first day or so. Its a shame my best matches with the Revenant were before they fixed the silver bug so I lost hundreds of thousands of silver in error.Im excited for this years Halloween mode and I hope the Monster tanks from last year will still be invited to the party.,WorldofTanksConsole,dd2t5pt,3,t5_39ysp

For example you are in a borsig and circle is at m with camo enemy team has patton with max vr setup and perks. Perhaps that  applies to the Patton? I just wish they elaborated on the circle description. From my experience the circle had been static besides camo net. If the Patton gets killed or something would that decrease the circle for me in the borsig? Because the other team loses its highest vr tank?

Just a super temporary silver boost so you can mostly equip one tank why sell a tier VIII prem for that? Just drive a credit earner for an evening and earn more than enough instead. If there were some actual sizeable useable worth something benefit from selling one which you couldnt obtain otherwise just with trivial effort then itd at least be worth considering but as it stands... theres really no point to letting it go whether you think youll ever drive it again or not.Meanwhile having an extra tank in your collection does no active harm and who knows? one day it might get a buff that makes it a competitive option maybe meta changes or some game mechanics tweak will strengthen it in some way or maybe at some point youll simply find yourself in the position of wanting to challenge yourself or are just bored of other tanks and dont want to spend money on a new one. Even if the probability is small its there.Or maybe you never drive it again oh well. No harm no foul.

10779942,0,t1_ddrswj2,For me yes its this. Other games have had tanks in them but they were on rails and big disappointment. This is the game that lets me be a  year old playing with his favourite toys again. But then again I do still read up on military history and any tanks that feature immediately become of interest in WoT. For example Mark Urbans book on the Desert Rats campaigns through the Middle East Italy and Western Europe featured the Matilda Grant Stuart and Sherman. Boom Im grinding those lines. The Last Valley about the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu features the Chafee as the only tank available to the Foreign Legion  it was the only one light enough to be flown in to the valley so Ive got to have a turn on that. Im scared to reread Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor as that would cover most of the German and Russian lines and I wouldnt be able to help myself....Edit book links,WorldofTanksConsole,ddrvfe8,2,t5_39ysp

Look up and notice theres only three tanks in our team... scratch that homie just died there two people. Last guys at our flag v I ping the map OMW! After dealing with a kv. Halfway there from the halfway across the map  I see who he was up against upon arrival and its...TWO PZ. VIV of course it is.  My little  hitpoints deflect  shot and rammed that ass for  ending the match. Long story short the tank is only as good as the team.  ,WorldofTanksConsole,dfhx1c4,2,t5_39ysp

Always good to soften ths target a bit then use the speed and RAM! Does exactly what its name suggests. I was top tier on Fjords and we were being capped by four t and s.

11399014,0,t3_62nqf9,Hmmmmm I like most of the changes except presumable consumables which I think takes some strategy out of the game. Oh yeah and some of the light tank changes too. They completely butchered the elc now. Its basically a shitty chaffe and the mm is completely unusable. Honestly Id rather light tanks stay as they are but whatever I guess. ,WorldofTanksConsole,dfo2at1,1,t5_39ysp

11785378,0,t3_6855so,I meant to post this in response to a comment a few days ago about someone saying they didnt like ranked battles or find them enjoyable and was going to ask why.  Lost track of the threadcomment that I was going to respond to it with though so here should be good enough. gt I actually really enjoyed them ranked battles.  As in REALLY REALLY enjoyed them.  I wouldnt even hesitate to say it was the most enjoyable I have EVER found WoT.gt The smaller size v was usually better because then tanks could focus on their specific roles instead of being forced to cover an unguarded flank in a cardboard box TD etc.  Note that I use usually here simply because someone may have gotten lucky MM a few times and placed into a tier they dont really belong in and in a v one potato is more problematic than in a v.gt Also it kind of made the gameplay better overall when you finally got to your appropriate rank if you want to call it that because you werent forced to deal with  of those aforementioned potatoes plus one AFKbasecamping top tier heavy vs. three platoons using proper communication on the opposing team i.e.  of random battles.gt Also if you wanted to improve you could just keep trying because you can drop divisions within a league but not leagues themselves so no real harm if you lose a bunch since it doesnt affect your stats unless they changed it against the players that are better than you and learn from it but who actually tries to learn new thingsbetter themselves nowadays though amiright?,WorldofTanksConsole,dgvwtsk,3,t5_39ysp
