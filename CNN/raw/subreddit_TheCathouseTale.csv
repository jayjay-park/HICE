2995553,0,t3_2ubt7m,I dont know barely anything about Unity engine so I apologize if Im highly uninformed about the feasibility of this but there are several graphical enhancements I can suggest.First off shadows are very low quality. Looking down at my characters breasts in first person shows this off. If the resolution size of the shadows could be increased to even just x it would look incredible.Second antialiasing. This isnt nearly as bad at all but with more rigorous and hardcore sex animations and a lot of movement there is some noticeable aliasing. If Unity does not support this maybe an FXAA injector might work?Third the models dont have normal maps. The normal maps look so good on everything else its a shame they dont apply to characters.One more thing unrelated to graphics but will the main hall ever expand? It just seems like an awful small place and it seems like that might limit future content. Even if none of this stuff is possible I love the game so far and really look forward to release along with everyone else! ,TheCathouseTale,co8hjdm,1,t5_368c0
