206213,0,t3_1wh6fq,My company switched from ANSYS to STARCCM about a year ago so I can expound on that but I have no experience with Autodesk.One thing that helped us decide to make the switch was that CDAdapco gave us a very long trial period so we could compare both and decide which we liked the best without the learning curve of a new software influencing our decision too much.  Also they were really helpful with support both during our trial period and after we made the switch.I would ask for a trial period of  months or so long enough to learn how to use the software and use it on an actual product.  Then you can make a real decision as to whether its better for your needs or not.,CFD,cf1xjab,2,t5_2r5wf
391311,0,t1_cfkgqi2,gt The Kraig Winters model?No its an inhouse code from a lab.  Its not written by Kraig Winters.  I wont mention the author here though.gt Speaking from experience...This was some useful information!  Thank you for the insight!  Indeed part of the problem now with the spectral code I am using is that it does not seem to be scaling very well past  or  processors.I heard a rumor that there are some decent algorithms for D FFTs which have been developed in the last  years or so but I havent looked into them myself.EDIT I found some information on doing PDFFTs Parallel D FFTs   Googling d fft also came up with a few related papers.,CFD,cflbpv0,1,t5_2r5wf

3104897,0,t1_cojqvy4,gtI take it you are not a fan of Ansys CDAdapco or Pumplinx? While I agree they certainly havent addressed all their issues they do a solid job at answering the questions industry is interested in from simple single phase problems to complex free surface turbulent transient simulations.I wouldnt say that Im not a fan. My issues with these commercial codes isnt that theyre bad. They do what theyre supposed to do  provide a foolproof graphical user interface to perform all the engineering analysis the industry could possibly need. Theres great value in that for obvious reasons.My issue with commercial solvers is that their current structure is the single greatest roadblock for numerical optimization to become the mainstream method of performing multidisciplinary vehicle design. Ill elaborate on this more below.gtI.e. there is little interest in higher order FVMs or turbulence models beyond SST.Im quoting out of order but I have to correct something here.This is not the demandinterest I speak about. The issue with these solvers is not about their accuracy. Its about their speed and their functionality in sensitivity analysis. Again Ill go into more detail below.gtOptimization is a hot topic but mostly in the sense of automation of geometry variation to explore the design space which is widely available now.Its widely available in the sense that you can throw a blackbox commercial solver into a gradient free algorithm genetic algorithm particle swarm simplex etc and get a solution out of it.Its not widely available in the sense that gradientfree algorithms perform hundreds of individual system solves with this commercial software to produce an answer which means that you cannot possibly use them for highfidelity systems with complex geometries or potentially coupled multiphysics where the analysis of a single design point is measured in hours not minutes.There are two major issues here that needs to be concurrently addressed.First is that commercial codes use really terrible coupling architectures when solving fluidstructure interaction problems. Almost all of them use a GaussSeidell iterative approach with a repeated handoff of aerodynamic forces and structural deformations between separate fluid and structural solvers. They do this because its easy to implement from a programming sense. But its also absurdly inefficient. There are much better ways to do this coupling that require a greater development time but pay off dividends in terms of runtime performance.Second is that gradientbased optimization algorithms only require tens of individual system solves compared to the hundreds required by gradientfree methods but they also need access to various residual and cost function Jacobians in order to build curvature information about the design space. Commercial codes dont provide any of this information even though some of those Jacobians are already calculated as part of the solution process. Furthermore these same Jacobians are typically used in some of the best multiphysics coupling schemes MDF for instance so they could really knock out two birds with one stone here.I know that Boeing has very good inhouse tools that they developed out of necessity. In fact one of the people who worked on it sat in on my presentation at AIAA SciTech just last January and grilled me with questions. The  wing is the product of that code and theyre extending it to the X now. I just sat through a couple of presentations where Boeing showcased their NASA SUGAR Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research work and every single one of them is a product of those same inhouse tools. My own research group has funding from the same NASA N initiative. Europeans have their own version of this and are involved with Airbus whos doing literally the exact same thing for AXWB and the potential redesign of the Aneo new engine option wing.So I think its incorrect to say that there isnt demand from the industry for these kinds of tools. There has been demand for it for years now preceding the  project. It is perhaps at its strongest today aggressively funded and pursued both by government agencies and by industry leaders but people have had this in the back of their minds going back almost to late s and certainly the early s. I think it would be better for the industry as a whole for tools like this to be widely available not just to the giants but to smaller companies as well. The commercial software developers have a big role to play in this and so far theyve been pretty disappointing on that front.,CFD,cojtksf,1,t5_2r5wf

4877384,0,t1_cu8z1z8,Nice.  May I ask which solverflow conditions were used? ,CFD,cu9bysc,1,t5_2r5wf
5893790,0,t3_3vwlrl,Keep in mind that the default settings in StarCCM show relative residuals meaning that they are the ratio of the current residual error to the error near the beginning of the simulation.As such if using relative residuals your final converged values will be entirely dependent on how good your initial conditions were.  If you started the simulation with the most basic initial conditions the residuals will drop based on how incorrect those assumptions were often quite a bit.  If you started with a perfectly converged solution like clearing the solution history only but not the fields then the residuals probably wont drop at all.Usually you look for the residuals to flatten out or reach a cyclic steady state.  Then you know that the solution isnt going anywhere and you might as well stop iterating.  Then you go and inspect the solution and see whether or not the results seem physical.  If you are in doubt increase the mesh quality in zones where you know there is complex flow phenomena and rerun the simulation.  Sometimes increasing the mesh density and quality in those areas will help the residuals converge more quickly in terms of iterations but each iteration takes longer.If you are looking for target values for absolute residuals which represent the actual calculated residual values for each of the parameters then one of the other responses in this thread addresses those to a good enough degree for most purposes.,CFD,cxs7khu,1,t5_2r5wf

7302153,0,t3_4fcz9v,A few things to try to help convergence for a steady solver.  lower the relaxation factors for U and p.  initialize with the potentialFoam solver .  start off with upwindd advection term and switch to second order after convergence looks good..  loosen relTols on p and U maybe something like ..  You can tighten it later if youre not satisfied with the overall residuals later on in the simulation.Edit.  If youre running a turbulence model make sure your initial and BC values are realistic.  a.  You can start it in laminar and turn on the turbulence model later in the sim as well. b.  If youre running a turbulence model you can adjust kepwhatever in the same ways you adjust p and U in tips.  Ive also not seen too much trouble in upwinding turbulent field values even for a fulldetailed like trying to get an accurate flow simulation.,CFD,d287ekn,1,t5_2r5wf
7319951,0,t3_4fj6kx,What upsylancer said is correct and I just want to add my experience in support of that.I had a BS Physics and MSME while using CFD CFX Pumplinx and Fluent specifically to assist design engineers and do some specialized blade design myself.  No PhD needed but certainly the knowledge from the MS regarding the guts of the solver and the theoryhow to leverage it was required.  Especially as the sole source at the company.I left to do a PhD in the LBM topic of CFD to head to research of methodology.  I see a few users mentioning LBM positively and correctly here which is nice after a past of patently false statements about it in rCFD .As to your qualifications in getting the job I did some hiring before leaving industry and I would have personally give your application MORE attention for having the math masters.  The engineering aspects are easy to teach on the job but finding engineers with an understanding of math and physics principles and those able to pick up odd new concepts like turbulence modeling is difficult.  Not that there arent very talented MS level engineers to do CFD it can just be disappointing how few are well prepared. ,CFD,d2a87xt,1,t5_2r5wf
