225390,0,t3_1woocn,Love this song. I remember  time a few years back when I was in the middle of workout regime this tune hit my ears during a shuffle of my MP player. I was too busy to look at the screen when it started but I had thought to myself when did I get this song from Led Zep?. It wasnt a perfect workout song but I clearly remember between short breaths and extreme lightheadedness attempting to figure out which Zeppelin album this was from. Then I glance at the screen....FOOK...The Racs. Fooking great tune.,blues,cf43wmt,1,t5_2qmzd

5987835,0,t3_3xdn3i,This article made some good points... but overall its disgusting.   It spent more time insulting people than it did talking about whether or not the photo is of Robert Johnson.  Not to mention that I dont think many people truly believe he sold his soul to the devil and yet this article has to criticism the story behind that as well.  TLDR keep on believing what you want.  This article says nothing of any importance other than  people who are NOT facial recognition forensic scientists claim the photo is not really of Robert Johnson.Im not saying I believe its truly a picture of Johnson but I am saying that Ill take the word of someone who specifically studies recognizing faces over someone who is just a fan of blues music or even a fan of Robert Johnson himself.  ,blues,cy4jbrr,2,t5_2qmzd

Guy fills each album with great new songs. Here is one I dig from a recent albumI guarantee if you write some blues in Japanese that speak to something common that you all share right now people will love it. Speak your experience. Write about what you know. Even your question here could make for a great tune.To me each blues song is unique and your argument is true. Yes the classics are great and there are many songs worth singing but when you write your own blues then you can really dig in and feel it. Then you arent just recreating something you are carrying on a tradition. Tell your story and your conviction will win the crowd for sure.,blues,d97jhwn,1,t5_2qmzd
