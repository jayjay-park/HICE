334951,0,t1_cfffmv7,Its just based on my experience that most people tend to slip after some time if the goals are not clear enough. Your experience may be completely different.Ive found that Im much more likely to succeed if I have quantifiable minimum goals. They should be small enough that you easily surpass them on most day but high enough that it does help you a little bit in the long run. For example if you usually play the guitar for mins each day set a daily goal of mins. On most days you will easily play more than mins and feel great because you overfulfilled your goal. But on those difficult days its low enough so that you can say Ah its just mins. Ill just do it quickly.So its important to set your goals just right. Like you said dont push yourself to hard. Just a little nudge. Set a goal of writing ONE paragraph each day. It also helps you to not feel guilty on those days where you just dont feel like writing. As long as you managed to write one paragraph youre good.Id be very happy if you give it a try ,theXeffect,cffhko4,1,t5_308c8

I went for many years quitting smoking on a regular basis over and over trying every method possible from cold turkey to the patch. Eventually I found the method that worked for me and have never looked back. I believe you will permanently quit smoking with the X effect. However if for some reason Im wrong keep trying to quit until you find your way. So worth it every damn day.,theXeffect,cgdg445,2,t5_308c8

My point is you can make big progress relatively fast in the beginning and you should be able to do  pushups in no time well maybe  weeksa month because its so much about motivation.

Exercise for  minutes a day. Spend  minutes doing chores. Go to bed  minutes earlier each day. etc. Repetition is the key.

I already have  Xs today. I want to really condition myself to be doing chi gong any free moment so thats kind of a hybridexperimental card. My plan is to just fill up the chi gong card with Xs rapidly and make another one for longer spans of time  say  minutes. My eventual goal is to be doing hour chunks of chi gong at a time.

Believe me I regret that now that I dont have an instrument at home... I was a music student I quit anyway its a long story.Dont get stuck on them though. Ive also developed some ways to practice because now I have quite a few opportunities to play the piano sometimes I visit a house that has an old one. That has left me with some good advice to give . Slow tempi. . Metronome seriously. People specially teachers say youll become a robot theyre lying. . Record yourself if you can. And I dont mean recording as trying to make a good recording... just record what you do i.e. record a section thats difficult for you just as it comes out with mistakes and false beginnings. Dont worry about it while playing the time for diagnosis will come when you hear the recording. I mean it. That will also give you an ear for dynamics and phrasing.Well thats just an opinion and something that worked for me.

11203382,0,t3_5zufkw,I defintiely think cards are a better move than just alarms.  I would highly encourage you to consider a proper bedtime as much as getting up before noon makes sense.  it is very literally the other half of the equation and you need that to balance  Equations must balance right? We remember that?  Stay up till  till  and your body still wants  hours of rest and since humans arent nocturnal the body resists that cycle and looks to overcompensate the rest period.And by all means do what thou wilt but favorite absolute favorite toothbrushign is the first one of the day where i get to wash that nasty foul schmeck out my mouth.  scrub those teeth grind right into the gumline.  BOOM!!!  Day is started.  helps me wake up and to a degree it helps me set off for the day.  Its a lot easier to tackle the day when you know youve already done some hygiene and are on point with your breath.    In my head is this decisive line that while both brushings are for me theres a social aspect to the morning one that Im helping me be more sociable by doing it.  Just a thought.Anyhow.

11767870,0,t3_67x98g,The sleep card is going good though to be fair it was a pretty low goal. Numbers indicate when I woke up stars are days that I was up AND dressed before noon. Can you tell by the stars which day my therapy appointments happen? This card is basically just to prevent myself from going completely nocturnal. Its a low goal but its super important.The teeth brushing card had been going pretty good too until I had a really bad week last week. Anxiety attacks two nights in a row then a migraine the next night had my top priority being laying in bed and pretending I dont exist. In those moments I really couldnt care enough to get out of bed and brush since laying in bed is the only thing that doesnt make it worse. Part of what I hoped to get out of this card though was willing myself to do basic self care anyway no matter how bad Im feeling. Maybe Ill repeat this card in a week if I dont feel like the habit stuck. The th night in that bad streak Id come home from a big social event and I was on the brink of an anxiety attack and trying to manage it. I could have brushed my teeth but I thought maybe if I give it a minute this uneasy feeling will go away and I can brush my teeth in peace? but then I fell asleep waiting to feel better. That was the only genuine mistake on the card I believe where I actually meant to do it but still didnt.,theXeffect,dgtx2zh,10,t5_308c8
