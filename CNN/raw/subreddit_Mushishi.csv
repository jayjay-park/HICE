4005666,0,t3_36cndg,My own random thoughts. Ginko does some amazing things in this story  communicating with Sui from the banks of the River of Light catching that horrific looking mushi in the middle of the flood of...whatever that was from Suis eyes turning a glass eye into a real one etc.  We begin to see inklings of just what a Mushi master is capable of.. The massive massive reveal of this story  Ginko has only one eye.  This is also a major plot point for later on.  It also speaks volumes about Ginkos character  prosthetic eyes arent cheap they certainly werent cheap in late Edoearly Meiji period Japan so the fact that Ginko gives Sui his glass eye is an enormously selfless and generous gesture.  This is one of Ginkos major defining characteristics  if he encounters someone in need there is literally nothing he wont do to help.  This is in deep contrast to Biki and Suis family who abandon Sui twice  once when it becomes apparent that her infection isnt easily gotten rid of and a second time when they think that Biki is also infected.. Clothes  We see Biki dressed in yufuku here alongside Ginko... an interesting choice on Urushibarasans part especially since Sui is dressed traditionally. The anime puts Biki in traditional clothes.  This is the story with Ginkos one and only deeply unfortunate sartorial choice. We will never see the shortsleeved mock turtleneck and the contrasting stripe pants again.  The anime puts Ginko into his usual outfit of trousers and white shirt. We will also not see Ginko with five oclock shadow again either.. The syringe  here we see Ginko using one of his western tools.  Also a story waiting to be told  where did he lay hands on that?  Theres an interesting difference in this detail between the anime and the manga in the manga the syringe is unsteady because the mushi inside are flopping around.  In the anime thats harder to represent so the shaking syringe leaves the audience with the impression that Ginko is also freaked out by the mushi but keeping it together for Biki and Suis sakes.  Which representation resonates with you?,Mushishi,crcvkb9,1,t5_2u6et

6650494,0,t1_d0743kc,I agree Id be interested in seeing what Ginko would do. We get an inkling of it though...his first instinct when on the Ragged Road is to seal the entrance.  His usual first step is to separate the mushi from humans they might victimize.,Mushishi,d077vnc,2,t5_2u6et
