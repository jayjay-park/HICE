5714756,0,t3_3tcm49,First to answer your PSU question. Use this utility to calculate how much power you need with some leeway ofcourse. Is your PSU of a good brand ?Secondly the  is pure overkill for all the games mentioned in your post. A  would be a great choice but if you really want the powerful GPU then go for it.,graphicscard,cx5gz77,1,t5_2xe9s

5967579,0,t1_cy1rypp,The thing that often appears and which leaves me stumped is when informed people ask the questionWhat do you want it for?. I guess its because this essentially tells anyone who knows about this stuff what they should direct their attention toward. However the reason it stumps me is I dont know what I want it for. I dont know what refresh rates I want or whether I need fps I dont know if I want full  or HDR do you know what I mean? ALL I know is that I want my games to look good. As to what would constitute that in technical terms Im totally lost. When you take this attitude with you in seeking to purchase a graphics card you lose heart almost immediately because of A the bewildering range of Graphics cards and B the language used by knowledgeable people. It feels like the GPU industry Wants people to be confused about this which is why I think Intels CPU intergrated Graphics is going to put the GPU sector out of business. Right now Im playing both those games on an i  intergrated Graphics and they are both playable. DayZ looks shit when theres a lot to render but it does that anyway without something like a . Elite has some pretty horrible aliasing issues and this is why I want a GPU for it but in relatively very little time I imagine Intel is going to corner this and dedicated GPUs will become obsolete. Its why consoles proliferate people dont want to be concerning themselves with technical stuff they just want to play the game and for it to look good not necessarily wow so lifelike. I am a bit weird in that I am basically a console gamer who can appreciate the finesse a PC offers kind of like a poor aristocrat.you know what I mean?,graphicscard,cy1vq1r,1,t5_2xe9s
6010532,0,t1_cy7hq0j,I quite frankly dont understand it myself. In league for example in the top left itll still SAY i have fps but itll feel as if I have maybe ? if that makes any sense. And what kind of sucks is I got the new card from NewEgg but they only sent me the packing list not the invoice nor even a little receipt paper I hope it doesnt screw me over.Edit I did try your cleaner you gave and got rid of the remaining AMD I did have.,graphicscard,cy7ieua,1,t5_2xe9s
6232163,0,t1_cyxwpht,Yeah definitely invest in a better psu. You really dont want one running below the minimum requirements of your gpu assuming itll run at all. ,graphicscard,cyy11x6,1,t5_2xe9s

7103623,0,t3_4cnnsa,I would buy a used card only if I can verify that is in good conditions and that it wont explode or break any other parts of my system.You can also try to search in your local stores maybe they can get you  a  without much problems.,graphicscard,d1lkh1z,1,t5_2xe9s

7932976,0,t1_d47g7e1,I havent used a laptop in a few years but I remember having this problem with Diablo . I believe I fixed it by right clicking the executive file maybe the shortcut in the start menu and there was a context menu that came up that allowed me to set default graphics card to be used. Also make sure your laptop is set on performance and not power saving mode which is in the power options in the control panel. My last suggestion is that the radeon control panel probably has a settings tab that allows u to set settings for specific games.,graphicscard,d47qoz7,2,t5_2xe9s

Weather the amd ones are good or not prices will drop and the  is a fantastic card for years to come. Low power consumption and great performance.

10946916,0,t3_5wcf91,The answer is whoever has the best product at the time. I needed a good video card for p  hz this generation so i bought a GTX. There isnt anything that AMD offer that can compete so i had to go with NVIDIA. Had there been an alternative i would have considered all of the benchmarks and decided on a card that offered the best performance for my money.
