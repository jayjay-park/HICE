596068,0,t1_cg7mhto,I uninstalled the game and reinstalled hoping that would fix the issue. It did not. It still happens each game. It says login and chat connection has ended. you may finish your game before having to log in again and then logs me out of the game.,SMITEbug,cg80z6j,1,t5_2urk7
630795,0,t1_cgbygoi,Nope I am from the good old US. It must be since all these new players are flocking in for the launch. Yes even before today people have been flocking to Smite just for that Beta Tester icon or to just get a headstart. ,SMITEbug,cgbz06l,1,t5_2urk7
657600,0,t1_cgf0l6o,Ive screamed tooth and nail against the HiRez echelon to get something like this running.. Im willing to help if needs be but you guys are the ones with every little bit of info running.Nothing in the game suggests the minions have X mitigation. Nothing says what order pen works in. Nothing says Auras dont stack. Nothing says slows dont do much after .My current mission is to work out what protections the fire creeps have. With the new damage log I should be able to do it.,SMITEbug,cgf0opp,1,t5_2urk7
681445,0,t3_21te66,Perhaps this bug is somehow related to the way that if you try to do a VGS ping too rapidly instead of pinging where you are trying to ping it pings the center of the map? To see this bug if youre unfamiliar with it you need to hit V and leftclick basically instantly instead of pinging where you look it pings the middle of the map.,SMITEbug,cghqbnu,1,t5_2urk7

766857,0,t3_22xpzm,This bug has been in the game for as long as Ne Zha has been in the game. If you do a slowmotion replay when Ne Zha ults someone he dashes to and collides with them then pauses for .. second before launching them up into the air. During that brief window you can use beads or the underCCaegis but if you do it wont break you out of Ne Zhas combo. Youll still be launched to the sky. You can dodge a few hits of his combo with the underCCaegis howeverSo yeah when you phrase it like that this should definitely be fixed. The ability to pop your beads  when doing so wouldnt change anything  should probably be removed.,SMITEbug,cgrg3eb,1,t5_2urk7

851893,0,t3_23o4kg,The same goes for Cupids Ultimate mesmerize and Apollos mesmerize. I believe that this is intended behavior and the descriptiondefinition of mesmerize in the game is misleading but perhaps its a bug. I just assumed that since it was in the game for so long it was on purpose.BTW tower shots dont break mesmerize either.... so if someone dives you under tower and they have tower aggro and you can mesmerize them...

983839,0,t1_chg4a26,I personally preferred the older classbased system of balance.
