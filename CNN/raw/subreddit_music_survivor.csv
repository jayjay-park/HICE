But the actual concept of the song the lyrics flows and voice switch ups on a mainstream level? That shit almost NEVER HAPPENS. Plus theres a part that was cut out for the radio version where the beat switches and he goes IN. Its actually a bit underrated when it comes to the lyrics and flows.,music_survivor,df6cc7r,19,t5_3jhz5
