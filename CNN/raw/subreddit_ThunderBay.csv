5113528,0,t1_cv21opa,Those are all valid arguments and I respect your right to any of them. I only had issue with the almost nihilistic approach to sharing your opinion. Had it been something along the lines    I personally wouldnt use or support Uber if they operated here. I believe that noone should support any company that operates solely using proprietary software or via unfairunconsumerist practices. I for one choose to vote with my wallet maybe you should consider too  I would be happy to discuss why.Or even        I would advise you not use the Uber service based on their track record of poor app security that has lead to multiple security breaches and data leaks. See sources here  Had that been the case we wouldnt be having this discussion. I would have respected your opinion and commended you for informing the general population on something they may not have otherwise known about. But the road travelled appears to me anyway more of the stand on soapbox  rapture warning variety. The end may be nigh but the majority will not take your movement seriously when it is shoved down their throats in a arrogant way save for like minded folks that already lean towards the cause in some capacity.To reiterate I respect your opinion and your right to express it  I even agree with the core value and belief I just feel the way it was approached with this audience will undoubtedly lead to downvotes and argumentsdiscussions.,ThunderBay,cv2ddky,3,t5_2qwdv

9002618,0,t1_d7txh9e,If you dont drink dont do drugs your chances of running into violence is rather slim.  If youre an aboriginal person sadly statistics say you are more than likely to do both.  Because of this a lot of our crime in our city appears to be caused by first nations people.  At least those crimes that hit the news.  We hardly hear stories of the  or so people the police arrest every week for alcoholdrug offences unless they are native.So either the media in our city is playing the race card or as our justice system shows first nations commit crime at an astounding rate especially in Murder I mean Thunder Bay.  Think about it.  In the last  years how many settlers have committed murder in our fair city.  How many serious assaults have been indian on indian?  How many of our armed robberies have been committed by first nations.  And as for the white jab our small black community sure as fuck has no problems our Filipino community has no problems.  Our Japanese community nope our Viet...well we got some Triad issues haha.  So as long as you dont do drugs dont drink excessively and dont have aboriginal friends who drink excessively or do drugs youre fine.  Yes you can be aboriginal and be fine as well but if your aboriginal friends drink excessively or do drugs well youre going to have a bad time.  Mods will hate me for this and I am sure SJWs will call me out again but theres a reason its called going native when aboriginals get drunk and become extremely violent.  And you know its bad when youre on a date with a first nations girl and she says Dont worry I wont get drunk and go native on your ass.  Im not that type of girl.I look forward to my second warning for telling the fucking truth.,ThunderBay,d7tz425,8,t5_2qwdv
