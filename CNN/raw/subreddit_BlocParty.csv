2682809,0,t1_cn8kp56,I wanted it to be a bit of a surprise so I purposely didnt type out a track listing encouraging it as a Present that of which you could download and find out.  Though not every song off TNS could be included if you are wondering.  Plus there may be some other surprises to go along with this BP Present. Also been slightly updated.  Many cheers to Finn Jain for taking the time to create some extra cover art to go along with this download thanks for creating it on short notice cheers. ,BlocParty,cn8rhss,1,t5_2t63e
2912816,0,t1_cnz1413,They played WWL only ONCE throughout its entire lifetime! ONCE!  At the docks at Toronto ON      freaking once!! And that song changed  times before they finally settled on WWL!!! Into The BlueCells Shaped Like StarsWe Were Lovers. If by some miracle there was some taper at the Docks in Toronto at that concert who recorded it then we would just have a case of not sharing but some hope of it existing.  But were pretty sol if they only played it once and that was our only chance of catching it live.... ever.  Sigh this was also one of the songs I was hoping they would some how miraculously replay live again some time post AWITCs tour.   ,BlocParty,cnz711m,1,t5_2t63e

3608441,0,t1_cq2otdt,Same.  I was hoping to see some classic bsides bonus tracks or other classics making it near the end Rhododendrons makes it quite well towards the end here.I figured the base core favourites would be the ones most commonly seen towards the end but was hoping for some specials as well.  They havent changed the setlists too much that I figure people have been forgetting about some of the older but still excellent songs in their catalog.   ,BlocParty,cq3l708,1,t5_2t63e

5013020,0,t3_3jjx04,Lyrically this is one of my favourite Bloc Party tracks. Has a sort of nostalgic feel to me too as its got a sound that a lot of British bands seemed to use later on around  and that was a pretty carefree funfilled time for me. Definitely in my top  BP tunes.,BlocParty,cuq9b97,3,t5_2t63e

5682152,0,t3_3rubty,I cant believe weve missed this.  I meant to comment on this and my thoughts. I really think Gordy was hopeful or at least giving us some hope for Bloc Party to return.  At least I think Gordy was giving some assurance for those of us who still wanted to see Bloc Party return at some point irregardless of what was going on internally within the band.  At least I view Gordy was trying to give us some hope at a time when we were very uncertain about the future of this band back in . also my brain is very borked at this moment and I practically repeat the same thing  times.... shush.,BlocParty,cx1fdia,1,t5_2t63e
