6656578,0,t3_3led0u,First car  First insurance policy tips?Alright Y!A?  Right so Im  and Ill probably be doing my driving test pretty soon because Im far into lessons and Ive passed my theory test already. UK  Northern Ireland Belfast Im just wondering what tips you guys out there have maybe from first hand experience or what your friends siblings or general family have done etc. Im getting around  in the June when I turned  because of a car crash I was in when I was like  so Im hoping to get a car  a years insurance for around  at the maximum. Hopefully Ill probably get a car of a maximum price of about  because in reality I dont need anything fancier than that the max engine size Id consider would probably be . and Id want my insurance to be such that I can use the car for work such as delivering pizzas or chineses etc. so I have more options trying to find a job atm. Im just wondering what tips you people have? Could I realistically get insurance for  Max or under on a  Max car with a . Max Litre engine? I might have to borrow money off my parents and pay them back when Im  if I pass a good few months before my birthday. Im not coming here telling you to tell me where to get cheap car insurance I hate questions like that lol cheap car insurance doesnt exist for  year olds because were all boy racers Blablabla its head melting! I just want to use my car to drive to college  minute drive possibly work in depending on if I get a job at this bar or not and drive to peoples houses if I need to and other general driving. Im not just going to drive it for the craic at am down the motorway doing mph I couldnt be bothered with all that. All I want is tips to get it as cheap as humanly possible like what I should do about named drivers voluntary excess and anything else that might drive down the price. When it comes to it Ill ring round every insurance company available to insure people in Northern Ireland and haggle them all quoting them against each other and hope for the best. Please dont tell me specific insurance companies to go for unless you know that they definitely include NI a lot of them exclude us. P.S. Im a sensible guy Im paying for it all by myself as far as Im aware so spare me the irresponsible kid joy rider inexperienced spoilt comments that so often creep up in these areas.

6657347,0,t3_3led0u,Farmers Insurance problem when changed from CA to OR?Hi Ive had insurance in CA for  years and moved to Oregon recently. I had my insurance tranferred with an useless Farmers Agent in OR. The thing is I already paid my  months premium in CA which is covered me until . I paid nearly  for until . Ive had quite a few discounts in CA but the jughead agent in Oregon not shifted any discounts to Oregon automatically. I got a bill for next  months from that agent saying that I have to pay  since I havent lived in Oregon for long enough. Jeez!!!. Its almost a  rise in my insurance that too I havent had any claims or ticket in my last  years. I went to meet him in person but he told thats all he can do it. He didnt look my CA policydiscounts too. Then I told him I can get  insurance anywhere else. But he challenges me if I could get something like that. I havent approached any other insurers yet. Is it anything like insurance history or something like that maintained nationwide or in Oregon? Does he threaten me based on somre record? Can I get some decent insurance from someother insurersagents? In CA Ive never paid my  months permium more than . Im the only driver for my car and the car is  years old. Ive never claimed from any insurance till date. I neither had any speeding tickets elsewhere. Can I get some insurance for some decent rate If I shop around? My farmers insurance expects to pay the additional premium in a week else my policy with farmers expires. I dont want to meet someother farmers agents. I wanna get out of farmers and go with someone else. Can I get some decent insurance in a week?,Highmark,d07xecx,1,t5_30ez6
