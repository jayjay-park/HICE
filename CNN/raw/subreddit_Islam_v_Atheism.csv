7701292,0,t1_d3gwb1m,Thanks for reading.Bukhari is the first one official collector of hadith and he gathered what is deemed to be coming from prophet pbuh and that era peoples lives. There are examples of burning and killing for apostates even though they are taken into other books as genuine there is no records in history books about those incident plus there is no repetition of such incidents.Quran confirms prophet has good examples to follow and refers to messengers acts hence putting scripture in the center you are allowed to apply what says in books of statements hadith. But only if they fit in a bill from Quran. A bill is a group of verses at least two which brings the wisdom from Almighty.Apostates had committed a crime against creation of Almighty and creation of His turns back to that person being Gods Grace electively avoids him. If the punishment placed in those fancy books happened to be the correct one God first show us that He had to end the life of Beelzebub then Samiris who made the cow had to be killed by the hand of Moses pbuh.Plus by taking someones life you end up their right to request Gods grace apostates are untouchable.,Islam_v_Atheism,d3hl3cd,1,t5_31z8l
8011302,0,t3_4fpimi,Islamic view on polytheistic worship is simple. Convert Submit or Die.Submission is not up to the infidel though you are not even human in a Muslims eyes only at the Muslims discretion.About sixtyone percent of the contents of the Koran are found to speak ill of the unbelievers or call for their violent conquest at best only . percent of the verses of the Koran are noted to show goodwill toward humanity. About seventyfive percent of Muhammads biography Sira consists of jihad waged on unbelievers. Acharya SD.M. Murdock Food For Thought on modern IslamKaffir is an Arabic term for a nonbeliever or infidel. Kuffar is the plural infidelsAlso spelled kafir or kaffir Kuffar is a highly derogatory Arabic term used to refer to nonMuslims though it is usually directed less against People of the Book Christians and Jews and more against others Hindus Buddhists Shintoists etc.Separate laws govern Muslims and kuffars in an Islamic state with kuffars being viciously suppressed. For example the blood payment to the family of a murdered Muslim man in Saudi Arabia is  Riyals the payment to the family of a murdered Hindu woman is  Riyals.All Polytheists are Kuffars to Islam.,Islam_v_Atheism,d4gjml8,1,t5_31z8l

9492436,0,t1_d9j4phc,I answered point by point. You said I wasnt a muslim my answer you can call me whatever you want.   You said my view of religion is my own personal adaptation my answer everyones view is their own personal adaptation.   You say muslims want to ban hamburgers or something my answer This is very obviously a joke someone made and you are too gullible to have realized.   You said rape doesnt exist under sharia law  my answer this statement doesnt make sense.  I think you meant to say rape is not punishable but that is also false.   You said extramarrital sex is illegal and sharia  my answer sharia is not one thing which you never have responded to and secondly Im against such a law.   Sharia law permits marrying babies  my answer just straight up false.  You have no citation for such a claim.  As you can see there is an answer for each and every thing.  If you disagree thats fine but use your words and describe why instead of insulting.  ,Islam_v_Atheism,d9j59cd,1,t5_31z8l

11669499,0,t1_dfbwzka,Everything of course becomes malevolent when taken too literally but in this context the argument doesnt address the problem sufficiently. There are one billion muslims which is a fact. However the description only few attacks is too vague. In context there has been multiple attacks in Europe alone that have been religiously motivated and have lead into casualties. Furthermore quite a few of islamic countries in comparison are unstable and hostile.  This has been argued to stem from politics instead of religion but in the other hand I have understood that Islam itself is practised strongly in politics.I have read the Quran myself and although I dont agree with the opinion of it being very aggressive or hostile in comparison to any other religious book I acknowledge that Islam would benefit from a reform much like christianity did couple of centuries ago. Even the peaceful majority of muslims cannot nor should shun away from the problems the religion brings.,Islam_v_Atheism,dgir4u4,1,t5_31z8l
