Might lean too much toward black metal for your tastes though. Also try NKVD and  for some more industrial black metal with an angry edge.Since I also like music other than black metal try Death Grips for a rap group with a lot of industrial influences Anarchist Noise Club for some angry gabber music Peoples Republic of Europe for some good rhythmic noise and Sin Dios for some angry frantic anarchopunk.,BlackMetal,ceualyf,1,t5_2rta0

I think its a masterpiece.Then if you dig that head to their early works and check out Minas Morgul and then move forwards from there.

8281753,0,t1_d5crsvc,may as well just listen to the whole albumIts a fine album. As for comparisons to melancholie well the atmosphere isnt as cold Im guessing hes that for his next album called Winter but its bleak and yet beautiful at the same time. Its got some great riffs and melodies nice production quality and what I would say stands out the most are the clean vocals. There are a decent amount of them in the album especially in the song linked in this thread. They fit nicely and were done pretty damn well.One of the things I thought Melancholie did better was the inclusion of those ambient keyboard driven sections like the very beginning of the first song Dream of a Dead Sun and Winterreise Autumn never had parts like that though it did have some acoustic sections which werent there on melancholie.Autum does have audible bass which is nice,BlackMetal,d5cs13y,5,t5_2rta0

A few are Sacrificial Massacre Hadak Ura The Cold Beyond and my project is Pravus Abyssus Ive lived in the rural areas my whole life and always felt we had a very good atmosphere for this kind of music.

9664070,0,t1_da42n0l,Im surprised you dont like Burzum then especially their Filosofem album since hes arguably the greatest influence in that subgenre this coming from someone whose favorite subgenre is also dsbm.I wouldnt look over classic BM though. Some nondsbm labeled songs can be plenty depressing. Like check out Nargaroths album Geliebte des Regens and his two songs Seven Tears Are Flowing To the River and Herbst. Also Luna Auroras alums Elixir of Sorrow and Hoagascht.,BlackMetal,da4arm3,6,t5_2rta0

10340854,0,t1_dcg68m3,good to see you like them  its also important to note that every album by carach angren is a concept album that tells a horror story which are pretty great. i personally wouldnt start on the album crows is off of most see it as their weakest. i would start on either Death Came Through a Phantom Ship or Where the Corpses Sink Forever those are my  favorites phantom ship being my absolute favorite. Here is a cut from corpses possibly my favorite of all their songs.  starts one of the most beautiful sections in any BM song imo.,BlackMetal,dcg70qx,2,t5_2rta0

10761714,0,t1_ddpcg7c,There is something to gain from everyones opinions on everything. I disagree with Varg a lot of the time but what interests me is not what he thinks but why he thinks it. Im not talking about what books or data he has to back up his crazy theories Im talking about the thought process that led him to a conclusion. Varg is a case subject of someone left to their own devices for decades. A growing mind given plenty of books but without proper challenge instruction or guidance from higher educated people. Take that and couple it with being a mass arsonist and murderer who was on the societal fringe to begin with and you end up with something thats very interesting to listen to even if what it spouts is occasionally insane. ,BlackMetal,ddpzp2s,2,t5_2rta0
