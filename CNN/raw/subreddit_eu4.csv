40851,0,t3_1ukmnq,As Portugal you have one overriding goal. Portugals entire might should be focused on making Sevilla the most powerful trade node in the world then taking as much trade wealth from it as possible. Everything you do should be toward that singular goal.First things first the English are a millstone with a really nice navy. Since Portugal doesnt exactly need help on the naval front drop them the moment you get the chance. I personally like to replace them with France as Im going to want to steal southern Spain from Castille eventually but the important part is keeping England from dragging you into pointless wars when they never help in your wars.Start with securing a route to India. Brazil is nice but since the trade money is flowing to Ivory Coast regardless of who owns the land owning it isnt a priority in the same way as say Cape is. On the military front use your easy friendship with Castille to get assistance against Morocco so that you can secure additional trade power in Sevilla.Once Moroccos secure keep going down Africa to prevent your rivals from getting in on the India trade for as long as possible. All of Portugals rivals are bigger and stronger than you for a long time so fighting them off is ill advised. Best to just cut them off so you can focus on the Indians.Castille is your big enemy. Once youve earned a big enough war chest and have a decent standing army wait for them to get distracted and strike. Ideally you want to destroy their power in Europe so that they are A no longer a threat and B no longer stealing your trade ducats. Keep in mind though that they and Aragon and Algiers to the extent that they own a couple provinces in YOUR trade node are your only enemy anywhere near your home. Once youve neutralized them Europe is a waste of time and money.Once youve secured the Sevilla node everything flows back to your single goal of trade wealth. Take the Adal node to send Indian Indonesian and Chinese wealth to Sevilla instead of Venice. Take Ceylon to secure the Indian trade. Ditto Bengal ditto Malacca for Indonesia. Once you hit India you should be so wealthy that the game becomes less What should I do from here and becomes more How much can I take from here.,eu4,cej2ydq,2,t5_2uqat

Taking out Portugal is fine but you should leave Aragon for when you get the Iberian Wedding event good chance this will fire. This can also give you Naples if you can manage to prop up Aragon in the mean time.You might want to beat up Portugal in a few wars take their Atlantic provinces first to completely cut them off from any meaningful colonization. You can manage this before you drive the muslims out of Iberia. If you delay it Portugal can build up strong alliances and England after they exit their war with France is no pushover.People tend to talk down England but thats only because they dont help immediately when its doomstacks attacking doomstacks.

If Ottomans cant move though Bosphorus it will be much harder. Either way is their biggest army in Constantinople? Good move all your army to Burgas wait for st of the month then declare war and immediately go to Constantinople. Theyll have zero morale so youll be able to easily destroy their army in one battle even if otherwise you couldnt do crap. Now that doesnt actually win you the war but it is extremely useful first step. Surely you can handle half their army especially if you managed to be dominant on the seas? Regardless stop with your microvassals silliness join HRE and become the emperor. That will give you infinite manpower and forcelimits and in a few reforms also infinite money.

Why when I owned every province could I not do that. If I kept the land occupied longer would it have been possible?Warscore and province costsgt When conquering other lands is it better to make them into vassals or protectorates? What is the difference?Vassals and Protectoratesgt I became the protectorate of Portugal after their king died even though I had no Royal Marriage or anything just a Allied Treaty. Why did that happen and is there a way for them to decide to break from me?Personal Unionsgt When expanding with colonies is there a downside to aggressive expansion?I think the other guy got confused by this because Aggressive Expansion is a game concept that has nothing to do with colonizing. You would incur a major diplomatic penalty from attempting to annex Mali to jump back to your first question. But it seems to me that youre just asking Whats the downside to dumping resources into colonizing? I will attempt to provide a couple possible answers to this question.. Colonial Nations which some of your New World colonies will turn into once they get big enough are nice for a lot of reasons but they dont provide nearly as much income to you the overlord nation as directly occupying provinces.. Overseas colonies are easy to pick off and hard to defend unless you spread your military and naval forces dangerously thin.. Related maintaining an overseas presence will tend to get you roped into fights you dont want.Those are just some possibilities I thought of off the top of my head its a subjective question.Cheers!,eu4,cfxngw5,4,t5_2uqat

The first theory says that you have to isolate the capital. Dont know if doing this by land is enough maybe sea connections count particularily relevant to Beijing because it shares a sea zone with ! other provincesThe second theory says that you can annex a capital if it is the wargoal i.e. CB Take Beijing you cant annex any other provinces in that war though or so they say. Note that you cannot claim a capital through the covert action Forge Claim but you can get a claim on a  random neighbouring province of a sophisticated nation if you are horde Manchu.Ill go test it out now and leave the results here for other people who come across this conundrum when playing Manchu.edit spelling,eu4,cgjv6wc,2,t5_2uqat

When people make mods they make changes to files containing information that paradox wants you to be able to make changes to code that is not compiled.

I have never made any mods to eu so I dont know for sure if this is the case but this seems reasonable to me.If however you can find a file where this code is it should be relatively easy to mod it such that you get what you want also without messing up the current mechanic when you have less than  warscore. ,eu4,cgztw4z,4,t5_2uqat

In my spain game I owned probably  of all slave areas in Africa with the Netherlands having maybe  my protectorate Ethiopia having  and the ottomans having the remaining . I was making far more money from grain than I was slaves with my supply being  and demand being  I think demand was supposed to be higher as I owned a lot of sugar cotton etc.. However once I abolished it I got mostly grain but maybe  ivory and  gold which made it worth it however since  of the supply went away it ended up having a supply of  and demand of  which made prices rise but still not as much as Ivory and nowhere near as much as gold. However because Ethiopia didnt get rid of their slaves And the Netherlands eventually abolished slavery soon after I still got the trading bonus from funneling trade down through the Gulf of Aden. Seeing as the trading bonus for slaves is  tariffs for my Spain having most of my new world revenue You cant hope to compete with the Netherlands and GB being in the form of tariffs this trading bonus is invaluable. In short owning a little bit of slaves lateendgame is very very beneficial despite losing value midend game,eu4,cifumbl,2,t5_2uqat

What about an alliance with Spain? also once you form the HRE on just conquer it all you will completely stomp France with any knowledge about the game and combat etc. Yes theyre strong but they ARE meant to be. The only things I would touch with them are the  army tradition  a slight nerf to their NIs. Thats honestly the only problems.

France and Castille should not ally by default or if they do this alliance should only last as long as Aragon is on the map. In a recent game Spain prefered to rival me Hannover even though we were allied and they shared a border with France. I went as far as to give France Spanish provinces in Iberia in a war against Naples in order to sow discontent.  years later they are allied again.They could also change the Burgundian inheritance or outright buff the  NIs and taxbase of Frances neighbours.,eu4,cisg4lf,4,t5_2uqat

1556075,0,t1_cjb01uk,  You start in  with the Ottomans at war with Albania.  There isnt much Byzantium can do in the way of reconquering any of their cores because mostly vulnerable countries like Naxos Cyprus Rhodes Corfu have all been guaranteed vassalized or allied to higher powers Venice Ottomans and the Mamluks.  This is a major problem especially since the Ottomans usually declares war on Byzantium after their war with Albania.  This gives Byzantium a few years to get bigger and therefore distract the Ottomans into declaring war on a weaker nation.  What I did was that I allied with Serbia Bosnia and Wallachia at the start of the game.  Then I declared war on Albania which happened to be a core of mine so I suffered no penalties.  After that I called to arms Serbia who refused.  This gave me a casus belli against Serbia.  I declared war on Serbia and with the help of Bosnia I vassalized them.  Before peacing out with Serbia however I called to arms Wallachia who also refused.  So with a vassalized Serbia I vassalized Wallachia easily and I did the same to Bosnia.  At the same time I was focusing my improve relations on Austria and Poland.  I managed to ally them and after that I waited for the perfect time to strike the Ottomans.  All this time Ive been building a navy of pure galleys because they do extra damage in inland waters even though I had to go to twice my forcelimit.  The perfect time came when Venice went to war with the Ottomans.  With a combined navy we destroyed their fleet and we blockaded Anatolia from the Balkans.  All this wasnt needed however as Poland and Lithuania PU came with their armies and we destroyed the Ottoman army.  I took back perhaps  cores in the Balkans and I finally had a foothold in fighting the Ottomans.  During the next few decades I continued to fight the Ottomans taking back more of my cores and even some noncores in Anatolia while the Ottomans collapsed releasing nations like Bulgaria in which I quickly vassalized.  The Mamluks also came and seized six Ottoman provinces.  During the third or fourth war with the Ottomans or so I managed to vassalize them by which time they were at two provinces.  Since the Ottomans had a string of alliances particularly with Crimea and Tunisia I also managed to conquer some Crimean land to vassalize them later and then I vassalized Tunisia.  After this I looked to reconquer most of my other cores which were in Venices control.  I waited for the perfect moment again and I became extremely lucky when Venices ally Aragon went to war with Venice.  I struck immediately destroyed the Venetian navy destroyed their army just idling at Corfu and I carpet bombed their nation.  This is how I took Corfu Naxos etc and also freed Croatia to vassalize them later on.  After this war I looked to cut down the size of the Mamluks who were getting as strong as me.  I DOWed the mamluks destroyed their navy though somehow blundering  light ships  ducats which really sucked btw.  On land however I was much more competent as I had higher military tech  compared to their .  I also had much more artillery supporting me with about k more troops active than them.  Their allies were nomads and the like that couldnt get past the Qara Qoyunlu borders.  All in all I carpet bombed the Mamluks and I took  provinces in the peace deal all of which were Ottoman cores.  I gave back the Ottomans their cores which in turn made them like me to  even with hostile relations and I immediately diploannexed them.Oh and yes the Ottomans did take a while.  Three years I think.  They had a  base tax or so.,eu4,cjbbsvd,1,t5_2uqat

This is due to pretty much controlling  of trade in Western Europe the Mediterranean and all of Africa sans Zanzibar. All of the wealth of the new world is funneled into Western Europe which is then funneled into Seville where I have a complete monopoly due to wiping out Portugal Morocco Aragon and Algiers.Until you get there though cut down on expenses by hiring  advisors lowering army maintenance until war comes and simply saving money until the need to spend it comes.

1626997,0,t1_cjk7pk8,Yeah so you want to make sure you recruit to your force limit. You will have an economy to allow you to go over it and still make money but its unnecessary. Save your money though because you are going to need it most likely. You should Rival Livonian Order Teutonic order and Muscovy. Now day one you should be trying to get two allies. You would want Lithuania but its impossible as they rival you so go for Poland and Kazan. You wont be able to ally them immediately so just increase your relations a little bit to ish and then you should be able to and you may need to ask for military access to get your relations positive with them. Once you have them allied you might want to try and get more allies but I found that difficult as you cant royal marry because youre a republic and also Orthodox.At this point in time its just kind of the waiting game. I personally attacked the Livonian order and took three provinces but I dont think thats necessary. You just wait until Muscovy attacks you and they are bound to attack you to speed the process up you might want to ally Tver or Ryazan as Muscovy tends to go for them early but do NOT ally them before allying PolandKazan. You should get war leader over them and be able to call in PolandKazan. You could go on the offensive and declare on them but the chance of being able to get your allies in is lower if its an offensive war. When Muscovy attacks Poland should bring in Lithuania with them and Kazan should join as well the combined forces should be enough to win. A little note though is that I got an event giving me a  tradition general two stars who tore Muscovy apart and later Denmark before tragically dying around  he will be missed. Anyway as the war drags on you may be running low on manpower and your troops may be depleted... dont fear because your god like economy should have you with  ducats and just spam those mercenaries if you need extra troops.After you have essentially won you want to cripple Muscovy so take as much as you dare but try to hurt them by taking valuable provinces and maybe making them release their vassals In the first war you will need to rely pretty heavily on your allies to do a lot of the work but you want to cripple Muscovy to the point where you shouldnt need help in a second war.,eu4,cjk8xtl,5,t5_2uqat

You want to do things like Getting all of your Colonial nations set upplease name them cool stuff like New Spain. Castillian Brazil and stuff sounds so bland in every part of the west coast before any other nation can grab it. This gives you time to let your colonies build themselves up and become stronger by themselves and if they keep up in tech colonize. Colonize only coasts so you can secure the inland parts. Make sure to do this as quickly as possible. Ignore the native nations until you have the entire coast and then conquer the coastal indian tribes. Make sure you secure every coast on South America and North America. It wouldnt be the worst ideaif you cant defeat France in warfare to let them get only  provinces in a colonial area so your colonial vassal can conquer them avoiding a war with France unless they Enforce Peace. Take out everyone on Britannia and if you can take Frances ports. Ireland Scotland and England will colonize regardless of anything. France cant colonize without ports. The quicker you disable France the better. Ally Austria for shitting on them unless someone else is stronger than Austria in Central Europe. PolandCommonwealth could be a good idea if they own Lithuania.Hope this helps! Colonizing coasts is what allowed me to secure every bit of land in North America in my ScotlandGreat Britain game.

1989585,0,t1_cksxlo3,Achievements Im going for the conquer India as a European achievement with a secondary focus on the Trade Hegemon uh Aden Hormuz Malacca as a Western European? achievement if the opportunity presents itself. Spain is the Emperor will probably fall into my lap at some point simply because Im going to keep eating HRE states until the stupid bastards elect me. Ideas Exploration Expansion Humanism Quantity Trade Offensive. I think. Id have to double check. Thats roughly the correct order. Portugal You kidding? I declared war on them as soon as I fabricated a claim. England was fresh out of the HYW and kept trying to land troops in Asturias I kept stackwiping them. I took Algarve and Portugals islands in that first war and kept cutting them down every time the truce expired. Then I forcevassalized them and ate them a decade later I couldnt be bothered to deal with their stupid Acadian colonies. As for France? Not gonna lie. France is a pain in the ass. I exploited Spains horribly overpowered colonists to ring Africa and South America in my territory thus denying France those colonies and pushed hard into trading company territory. I picked up a bunch of strategically invaluable colonies Cape Grain Coast ? Makassar Taiwan and used those to leverage trade hegemony. Ive found that if you take Taiwan and then use the Overseas Expansion Expansion ideas CB on China you can take Macau and Guangzhou in one war. Those three territories will give you the majority share in the South China Company. The Philippines is even easier eat Makassar and youre golden. South India can be won with Ceylon and one or two territories on the southern end of India theres another trade center near Ceylon but dont remember the name and some improvements. East Africa falls in your lap after Zanzibar and Mombasa which are relatively cheap provinces given how valuable they are. Basically if you can gobble up the trade companies quickly you can get tons of extra merchants. As you can see in the screenshot I have  of the buggers. I was making mo in time of peace with max maintenance and  regiments. Even after scrounging up another  mercenary regiments and accounting for losses I was still very much in the black. I could simply afford to wage war much longer than France which always helps. Plus those merchants require a majority share so every one you get denies one to your rivals. Never underestimate how valuable that is. As for actually defeating France? Thats by far the hardest part. As I see it there are basically two methods.. The British method Sink their ships blockade their ports occupy their islands burn their colonies stomp on their colonial nations and use hitandrun tactics while your allies preferably someone with lots of troops like Austria or Russia dies horribly over and over against them. Eventually theyll run out of diplo points to pay down their WE and weaken. Use your armies for surgical strikes intended to wipe out smaller stacks. . The Russian method get Quantity ideas. Get tons of troops. Stockpile lots of manpower. And bury the French under the corpses of your slain soldiers. Disregard your casualties. Rotate fresh stacks in after every battle while your other stacks are sent somewhere to recuperate if you can get the  reinforce speed adviser do so. France has a ton of troops but not even Frances manpower is enough to keep up with that kind of meatgrinderesque war. Especially if you have allies or even burly vassals who will throw even more troops into the mix. The trick to this strategy is using those fresh stacks to run down defeated armies and stackwipe them. Oh and dont be afraid to make use of vassals and then eat them. Its not pictured but thats why I own Scotland. And the  regiments I had camping on Englands border were a decisive factor in beating France. ,eu4,cksy1kr,7,t5_2uqat

Quite good but is basically a religious instead of humanist not quite as good version of Poland.gtFrance?France Id put on par with Italy but not higher.gtWhenever I play an Italy game I get my face continually smashed in by all of my neighbors even when I outnumber them  to .Theres more to a powerful nation than good ideas. Since youre playing in Italy are you attacking into mountains? Never attack into mountains. Ill run through Italys ideas just so you know why I favor them so highly.Italian Traditions  global trade power  better relations over timeIts funny how good these traditions are. I forgot just how big the numbers were on this yikes.  trade power is an enormous amount from any one idea only Aragon and Gujarati nations can rival that. Coupled with the Venetian node Italy will be making buckets of ducats off trade. And the  better relations over time boost is really huge. You can max out relations with people really quickly which means you can improve relations with more people which gives you lots of padding against AE. Youll also make friends more easily meaning its easier to have good allies.Not a Geographical Construct  stability costsThis boost is fine nice to have but not really a game changer.The Tradition of the Legion  infantry combat ability infantry combat is a LOT. This boost alone will let you outfight everyone in your local area with ease with the exception of a lategame France earlygame Ottomans or possibly an earlygame Spain. Only Prussia and Sweden have better ICA and only Bulgaria has equal but really since when have you ever seen Bulgaria?.Mare Nostrum  galley cost  galley combat abilitySince AoW this idea has gotten a lot better now that AI Mediterranean nations build a lot more galleys themselves so naval dominance is quite a bit harder to come by. With Mare Nostrum you can afford tons of really powerful galleys and knock down your enemies ships much more easily.The Office of Censor  national manpower modifierThis is a bigger manpower boost than even Russia gets. That should tell you something right there. Manpower is extremely important  being able to throw tons of men away without it making a dent in your manpower is crucial to lategame European wars which become battles of attrition more than anything else.Italian Tax Reform  national tax modifierFollowing up on the previous idea more money lets you fight wars longer and harder.  is quite a sizeable bonus especially considering the exceptionally rich Italian region and the trade bonuses. Italys going to be making bank.Heir to the Empire  IAIf you want to play the HRE game this is the most significant bonus any country gets towards it. Personally I dont love gaming the Empire but it really is a big bonus if thats what you want to do.The Path to Citizenship  coring costThis right here is the crown jewel of Italian ideas. Sure the rest of them are strong and a bit OP at times but this coring cost reduction in and of itself is Italys strongest asset. Italy suffers less AE due to BROT bonuses and has lots of money and manpower for constant warfare so youll constantly be able to take land and core it. Italy has some of the best ideas for fast aggressive conquering in the game. And ultimately no other ideas can compete with just being able to take more land more quickly than any other nation.Italian Ambition  fort defenseA nice solid boost to round off this really good arsenal of abilities.Thats why I like Italian ideas so much.,eu4,clzh5zn,3,t5_2uqat

You know where half of the world is by guessing from your start and if you dont randomize America then the New World discovery losses some awe as its a yeah been there done that I expected exactly this you know the Ottomans and France rule and where each religion and trade node is.AT some point I want a world that I actually have to explore will this land I am colonizing extend towards that area I can see beyond Terra Incognita or will it cut short? Is there going to be a good trade node and provinces or only deserts and sadness?Thats something I love of Civ games exploring and feeling like the land I am taking is new and now mine not a Yeah it says France but thats China.And again both options no reason to throw those that like Earth under the bus for me to get my wish.

I also really like the special buildings for extra leaders and  technologiecost and the  ambassador can also be really great.what else I build depends on location. the hansa? everything everywhere but always trade first. ottomans I build tradebuildings in constantinople and egypt to block eastern trade from reaching europe while with poland I focus more on manufacturing and tax because unless I have already taken constantinople or lubeck trade will be a lesser part of my income.so more generally if you can get enouh trade focus on building tradebuildingsespecially in provinces with estuariescenters of trade another good thing about tradebuildings is that they use diplopower wich usually is less impotant to me than military or admin. for the same reason I also often build at least the st level docks the tradebonus is nice too.if you cant get much from trade in your region its less worth it to invest in buildings. but courthouses are still very nice both with the reduced revolt risk and tax bonus if you can afford them. the manufacturies are also totally worth it but I usually only invest in them later when I need every monarch point I can get but my treasury keeps piling up so manufacturies are a nice way to invest some ducats while spending minimal monarch points and after a manufacturebuildingspree I can see my income rise significantly.  ,eu4,cnn0eb3,1,t5_2uqat

2820373,0,t3_2sedok,Your first idea should usually be a Diplo Points idea. I always follow this guideline because early on diplo points are kind of expendable while military tech    and  are all key milestones to hit ASAP and doing admin  isnt that long if you dont take an admin idea first AND this allows early cores and potentially even early Temples.That said I tend to start with Diplomatic Ideas The group specifically because ideas  and  are invaluable in a game where alliances are the difference between life and death. One extra means to attain them and one extra slot to keep them safely is invaluable.The only exceptions are when I take Exploration first for obvious colonializationrelated reasons Either because I play a natural colonizer or I play somewhere in ROTW that can colonize early to try to reach Westernization ASAP. As Hordes I usually go for Administrative or Innovative first depending on whether I plan to core very loudly or if I want to try to mitigate my military tech weakness a little. It goes counter to my initial paragraph but Hordes are a different beast.To maximize my points I never buy tech until my points pool is full. This has  effects. Short term I will fall behind because filling the whole points pool takes longer than just teching up ASAP. This is useful for westernization but having Admin and Diplo points on hand at all times is incredibly invaluable. No waiting for peace deals can buy down WE in a jiffy I can exit a peasants war instantly etc. And by falling behind as a nonwestern it makes Westernization much more easy. Second on the long term I spend less points per tech level which gives me more points to do other stuff with. Of course if I suddenly get in a war with someone technologically superior in military I will tech up grudgingly just to avoid losing the war.,eu4,cnoo452,18,t5_2uqat

2839763,0,t3_2smndc,Hey there the easyboring part of my first ironman is just about over and Im wondering if anyone has general advice for a native game after that point. Anything would be awesome but it would be great to know. Idea groups? I will get two more Exploration is already filled up and I have  monarch points in each category so I can mostly fill up two more groups. I was thinking of Innovative mostly for the tech bonus along with Quality and together they give a policy that increases combat ability which stacks nicely with an Iroquois tradition. Perhaps I should take Humanist though? It would give me a price break on ideas and would make westernizing easier.. Where should I head next? Ill have a few years between reforming and westernizing that I dont want to waste. It looks like Panama is not colonized yet so I was thinking of taking that right after reformation. In the long term that trade node gets trade from Asia and if all goes well I could start gaining power in that node and the ones leading into it. Unfortunately Europe already controls most of the Caribbean so it will be tough for me to control trade much there. Also unfortunately I think if I snag five provinces there they will turn into a colonial nation and I may lose out on .If the Inca arent conquered I also could head down there and liberate four of their gold provinces to make up for my bleh income. I could possibly do that before westernizing.. Why is that game pushing the Q and O so close together?!,eu4,cnqvlhh,1,t5_2uqat

GBR potentially starts in a stronger position than Castile for WC though as they have access to claim throne CB on France on day  and they have easy access to subjugation of Scotland which allows them to inherit Scotland for free.Castile is probably easier for a newer player but I think GBR has the overall more powerful position for fast WC IF GBR can get Scotland into an offensive war and get Scotland tons of vassals.,eu4,co53goo,1,t5_2uqat

You can still use trickery to find your way into wars by enforce peaceing but thats usually a tall order. After the Colonial Trade game you played Id recomend either collosalempire expansion Ottomans maybe Russia or France or the TinyOPM to regional power diplomacy game Gotta find allies to beat up your rival for you. The other option is being the emperor of independant states Austria in HRE or Japan  Shogunate trying to integrate them into a proud nation. Personally I like the One Province Minor to slightlymorethanoneprovince games. Things like Utrecht to Netherlands Munster to Ireland or Ragusa to Croatia are really fun to me. I win when the game lets me tagswap but I get to keep making a name for myself.

3021183,0,t3_2upmmt,Honestly as Reformed Prussia becoming HRE likely isnt going to happen unless you vassalize electors. In my opinion your goal should be either to assure that Austria doesnt get elected or just straight up do all you can do dismantle Austria entirely preferably both. If youve dismantled PolandLithuania Austria is your biggest enemy aside from France and you should go all out in getting rid of them.In my Brandenburg game I assured that Bohemia remained Emperor while maintaining an alliance with Austria. Try to expand where you can using Austria to help if they will and insure that you get more than they do out of every peace deal. Eventually youll be way stronger than they are and you can hit em hard. OR you can immediately break the alliance ally with someone else big wait for them to get into a bad spot and then take advantage of that. In my Brandenburg game I allied France after I wanted to stop being friendly with Austria. Basically as Prussia your power is stronger than your size. You can hit way above your weight and can win wars even when outnumbered especially if youve completed Quality ideas. You can choose where to go whenever you want really. If you want to beat down Austria do it because unless they have a massive alliance against you you can beat them.,eu4,cob55q4,1,t5_2uqat

If the combat width is  you need  cannons at least  more inf  and only a few horses for flanking  is the magic number.Why this setup?In eu combat has  lines and a combat width. If the combat width isnt filled all units will fight on the first line. If this is the case a bigger army can flank a smaller army and cause more casulties. So for this reason you need more troops than the combat width.  If the combat width is filled some units will fight on the second line. These units cannot engage the enemy. Unless they are cannons cannons can deal damage from the second line. Units on the second line are also safe and cant gain casulties. This is good because cannons suck on the first line. If your first line gains casulties the units of the second line will replace them. Thats why you need at least  more inf than your combat width they will keep the enemies engaged while your cannons blast them away. The  cav will be on the side of your army and will flank the enemy and deal good damage.,eu4,cp0z9ea,9,t5_2uqat

This is a very nice feature to have so that you dont need to mindlessly click on every province one by one.The Religious League Wars are another nice addition although only really relevant when playing in Europe. Basically after the Protestant Reformation has happened the Protestant League can start which any nation can join likewise the Catholics will also form a League lead by the Holy Roman Emperor and at some point the leader of the Protestant League will declare war. This results in most of Europe being at war for a long time which is very fun in my opinion.Here is the link to the Art of War wiki page  There are lots of features which you might not really use much or notice but after having played the vanilla game it is clear that some of these features are useful.That said I noticed that Art of War is only  off so if youre uncertain as to whether youll continue to play EU that much it might be worth waiting.,eu4,cp17ba5,2,t5_2uqat

3279456,0,t1_cp22o4u,Yeah you cant build boats while youre primitive. That was more advice for when you start attacking them or for while youre still behind on tech after youve westernized.They will not be hostile towards you until they decide they want your region when you first meet them their attitude will be unknown. before they can desire your land they need to have discovered it too which the new exploration slows down somewhat. I didnt have them attack until about  or so they were not hostile until right before they started attacking.As long as you stay at the same military tech level as the other natives you dont need to worry about it youre gonna be so far behind the westerners it doesnt even matter so I would focus on admin. And never buy diplo tech unless you are capped on points it is completely useless to you. When you open up exploration ideas you should have enough points to get the entire group all at once which nicely gives you CBs on everyone near you. You can also use that CB to attack the north or south american natives and get closer to the westerners to westernize fast. Dont bother colonizing as the Maya until after you have passed the last reform when you pass reforms you will give up your colonies too. you dont necessarily have to keep a big ally after you westernize but it would help.,eu4,cp231re,1,t5_2uqat

Since colonies are dirtcheap I was able to get both colonial nations Spain had formed for  warscore or less. My time can easily be beat though since I didnt know South Georgia counted as part of South America and had to declare a second Imperialism war just for that province gtgt. Also you can go for Religious ideas and just use that instead of waiting on the imperialism casus belli.As for westernization I used a tip I found in an AAR here on this Reddit. Instead of instantly westernizing I decided to become a protectorate of in my case Holland first. Im not quite sure how it helped me but it can come in handy to get a first ally in Europe since Westernization automatically ends a protectorate and your former overlord usually still loves you.,eu4,cp2esnn,1,t5_2uqat

Youre going to be short on ADM for awhile though my recommendation. If you have the stomach for it beat the Mamelukes until they cough up nations. Beat those nations into vassalhood. Annex to save on ADM for a few decades.This is less feasible now that the ohsosensical liberty desire mechanic is in place universally try to avoid more then two more or so? vassals even smaller ones.

Poland and whatever allies you have will easily overwhelm the armies of bohemia or hungary. regarding Burgundy I found that the best way to go is to get the burgundian inheritance to fire take the low countries and then release burgundy in a peace deal with france at some later point. that way you can get the enforce PU event with them as well and feed france to them.Just a side note in my Austria game I moved my capital to Holland to prevent the Dutch from ever spawning. seems like a worthwhile gain from just a few hundred adm points.also regarding IA releasing opms is the easiest way to get IA other than defending the empire before the reformation. it sounds like you did it just fine...  reforms before the reformation fires is fine. as many guides will advise dont try to get IA again until after the league wars end. it IS possible but enormously frustrating to have  IA from various things and then  princes convert and put you back at  IA. Plus even if you DO get to  you need enough princes to be in your favor that you can pass the reform which isnt always possible.After the league wars you can diplomatically enforce religious unity on princes but i would advise against this at first. it is better to go to war with princes and enforce religious unity in the peace deals so that you dont get big negative modifiers from the diplo action. however once you pass landfreide you cant JUST go to war with princes anymore. but you CAN go to war with allies of princes and enforce religious unity as separate peace deals with the princes as well as force them to spit out HRE princes for even more IA!in my game i DID use the diplomatic enforce religious unity option but only after passing erbkaisertum so i wouldnt have to worry about staying emperor. I also did it to about  or  electors at a time. although it gave me like a  relations penalty all of that disappeared within  years i think. as in it just stopped being there. i therefore found myself with like  or  IA by the time i wanted to revoke the privilegia and was easily able to get every prince to agree. after that you will get IA REALLY easily as austria since you will probably have inherited bohemia hungary and burgundy twice! and will be far more powerful than anyone by yourself though you will also have the vassal swarm... and i wouldnt pass the last reform until youre totally done conquering whatever you want. you will almost certainly have  IA by then.,eu4,cpxwwsk,1,t5_2uqat
3560568,0,t3_313d3w,Its not that hard to fight France as Austria. They have better military ideas than you but thats why you play to your strengths. Get yourself a shit ton of alliesvassals and outnumber them. Take advantage of opportunities to PU both Bohemia and Hungary atI dont think the FrancePoland alliance idea is a good one at all. You dont wanna ally any major powers who directly border the HRE simply because you want them to attack the empire so you can fend them off and get tons of IA for it. France is a definite nono they should be your mortal enemy all game. Poland there is a bit more leewayif they dont expand westward toward you and especially not into the empire then an alliance isnt out of the question. But if they start taking imperial territory you should abandon them and fend off their attacks or release princes for IA instead.Your natural allies are Spain Russia and occasionally England if they dont fall apart. With Spain in order for them to be an effective counterweight to France you may have to help them get off the ground and make sure they dont lose their PUs with Aragon and Naples should the Iberian Wedding occur so keep that in mind.,eu4,cpy4p43,1,t5_2uqat

Wait for ragusa to trap their troops on rhodes. From here march your troops over to ragusa. You will probably want to vassalize them since ragusa is out of your coring distance. If someone declares on them while you are at war you can just annex them and then release them. After this you just ally venice and wait for the mamluks to be in a weak position.

All of them required very specific circumstances and could very well be lost. If it wasnt for PLCs interregnum PLC would amass k army that would beat Ottomans back and destroy Crimean Khanate creating a power vacuum and securing Ukraine. Meanwhile Polish king died and the plan backfired horribly as powerful Cossack Hetmanate freshly mobilised for war against rebelled in the worst possible moment. And then came the Swedes and Russians all of whom were defeated in a phyrric victory that speaks volumes of PLCs power back then.If it wasnt for Peter the Greats genius Russia couldnt win against Sweden. Catherine the Great would not be able to capitalise so well on Polish and Ottoman weakness.

3929645,0,t1_cr477zz,Yes it is because if you take into consideration the player pretty much anything in the game is possible. I can say that Foix can conquer the world and while it is possible its so unlikely that itll never happen in any game that Foix is not played by a player. Its like setting up an experiment to how long fish can live in a tank without food and extra oxygen and then throwing a shark into it. Youre adding an overpowering variable that tips the results into one outcome.The IC point is not a red herring. Because the Ivory Coast is always underdeveloped discounting player involvement so less tradepower is applied onto the Brazil node so less money is pulled out of it. The AI is highly unlikely to send tradeships to the Brazil node to push trade away from it whereas there are pretty much always tradeships pulling trade away from Chesapeake Bay. Im not saying its the defining factor. Its undeniably one of them.Yep. Thats a valid point.,eu4,cr47red,2,t5_2uqat

4153657,0,t3_387g5w,Culture and religion should have a major rework. But just modifying a little bit of what we have today isnt going help anything maybe it could even worsen the problem.Breton is celtic but some time after their anexation to BBB the breton provinces could get a modifier french and work like any other french province thanks to this modifier. The same could work the other way around. After being too much time independent from Germany HRE too dutch provinces would get a modifier to denote that they dont see the cultural union as their country anymore. It would even help the cultural bullshit that is the colonial nations right now. Imagine a scenario where there is both Portuguese and Spanish Brazil coexisting. Portuguese Brazil annex the Spanish one. After a bunch of years of colonization and expantion all colonial nations would be get their independence but the spanish provinces in Brazil would be more happy being part of others former spanish colonial nations. This is wrong in so many ways but a single modifier brazillian would fix everything even removing the need of converting the culture of the conquered indigenous provinces. This idea would simulate the cultural diversity and differences between the colonial and parent nations since environment natives and slaves broughts from Africa had a significant impact on the cultural development of the New World.,eu4,crtqaye,1,t5_2uqat

4203012,0,t3_390n9d, Expansion Features Theocracies now have heirs that are chosen by event with each choice having a different effect and unlocking certain events that can happen once that heir becomes monarch. Theocracies now have Devotion which is similar to Legitimacy and Republican Tradition. Devotion goes up from high stability and pious acts and goes down from low stability and low religious unity. Devotion affects your Papal Influence Church Power Prestige and Tax Income.  Constitutional Monarchy Constitutional Republic and English Monarchy now have Parliaments. Countries with Parliaments have to grant a certain number of their provinces Seats in Parliament which then allows those seats to vote on issues. The country with the parliament can choose between a few randomly picked issues and then have a number of years to secure enough votes for the issue to go through. Votes are secured either through events or by bribing parliament seats with things which that particular province wants. After five years of an issue being debated there is a random chance that the vote will go through at the end of each month with the chance of winning the vote depending on how many seats are backing it. If the vote goes through the country gets the benefits of that issue for  years otherwise it suffers a penalty to prestige. Protestantism now has Church Power. Church Power accumulates over time and can be used to buy aspects which are permanent modifiers added to that countrys particular version of Protestantism. A country can only have  aspects after which Church Power can be used to trade in an existing aspect for a new one. The diplomatic action Remove Electorate is now available to the Emperor to remove an elector at the expense of worsened relations with other electors and  IA. This action is not available unless the HRE has an official religion. Implemented Government Ranks feature. Each Government type can now have up to  ranks with higher ranks conferring better bonuses and higher government ranks lowering cooldown on changing your National Focus. Players with the Common Sense expansion can dynamically change their government rank through the Government screen and various events and decisions while those without are locked to rank  or  depending on whether they are independent unless they are playing a historical empire such as Byzantium and Ming. Buddhists now have Karma. Karma decreases from aggressive conquest and increases from honoring alliances and releasing nations. Rulers with too high Karma become detached from the world and suffer a penalty to diplomatic reputation while rulers with too low Karma will lose the trust of their mind and get a penalty to discipline. Rulers with balanced Karma get a bonus to both discipline and diplomatic reputation. Can now return an owned province to another existing nation that has a core on it for an opinion boost at the cost of  prestige. Doing so will remove your own cores and claims on the province. This cannot be done while at war. The Emperor can now grant Free City status to nations in the HRE that only own one province. Free Cities get a special republican government a bonus to tax income and will always be able to call in the Emperor when they are attacked even in internal HRE wars. The Emperor gets a bonus to tax income manpower and imperial authority for each Free City in the HRE but there can only be  Free Cities in total at any given time. A Free City that gains a second province or leaves the HRE will lose their Free City status. Free Cities cannot be Electors. Can now Pause Westernization. While it is paused no monarch power will be spent towards westernization progress and no westernization events will fire but the country will continue to experience unrest. Added Subject Interactions for all subject types. These are special actions and toggles you can enact on your subjects such as forcing a colonial nation to declare war on another colony placating a vassal to lower their liberty desire or forcing a lesser union partner to adopt your culture. Subject interactions are accessed through the country subjects screen. You can now increase the base tax base production and base manpower of your provinces at the cost of admin diplomatic and military power respectively. Cost of developing a province depends on the terrain the climate and how many times the province has previously been developed. Certain ideas and modifiers will also increase or decrease development cost. For those without the expansion reduced development cost ideas will instead give other beneficial effects. If you have money to burn you can now dismiss an advisor from the pool allowing greater control of the advisors you can select. Numerous new events for Buddhists Protestants Theocracies The Papal State Subject Interactions and Parliaments. National Focus is now also available for players with the Common Sense expansion even if they do not own Res Publica.,eu4,crzc1kn,67,t5_2uqat

4337442,0,t3_3aonrw,I suppose you could station some troops down in those provinces as a first response. That way you could catch some of the smaller groups right away to keep them from grouping too large and pave a path for your reinforcements. If you cant afford to station permanent troops there the only real thing you can do is to be watchful always of all of the possible revolts and their percentages. Once the rebels get closer to firing you can move an army there and be ready for them. Also dont be afraid to raise autonomy or use harsh treatment if you feel it could save your country from a lot of trouble or if you cannot get an army there in time.IMO Stationing troops is the best option because you can put them in the province you know is going to revolt and the rebels will get an attacking penalty for whatever terrain the province has which gives you the best combat chances. Also if you are forgetful like me you dont have to remember to send your troops down because they are already there. ,eu4,csek5hd,2,t5_2uqat

They taught me you can mothball a fort to save money how to manage your AE using terrain modifiers to your advantage and lots of other little things. I never used the coalition map mode until I saw them do it. Ive restarted a bunch of times trying smaller countries. It does suck considering how many hours the game can take from you so I try to be careful.  I agree with ArjaaAine  Set yourself a goal. Try the achievements! This past weekend playing as Milan as I got the Italian Ambition achievement which made me super happy!  Optional Story time.I bought the game and dove right in with a Poland start as I wanted the Poland achieves.   My first few games I was rather ignorant of aggressive expansion proper alliance making and other things. I got my achievements but not without a few headaches. I have only ever rage quit from one game so far the others Ive either accomplished what I wanted or are outofdate. First game Annex the entire Teutonic Order in one war.Result Massive overextension rebellions had to struggle to contain them all which set me back a while. Later that same game Invade HRE country not knowing the Emperor would defend them. I didnt fully understand what the checkmarksboxes next to war alliesenemies meant. Result  Make great gains initially until the Emperor Austrian shows up and push me back and occupy some of my territories. Struggle but manage to white peace out.Second game  Go to invade Bohemia to claim Wroclaw and some other provinces I view as belonging to Poland. This time I wait until the Emperor is an OPM and then strike.  Result War goes better than expected instead of just the three Bohemian provinces I wanted I slice off an extra three from Austria as well.  My aggressive expansion goes through the roof I get the entire HRE in a coalition against me.  A few years later they invade break my PU with Lithuania and take some territories.  This was the one game I rage quit from. ,eu4,csjfbzz,1,t5_2uqat

You can pile on the loser of one of those wars to establish a beachhead and eventually get that gold.You never know which powers will emerge from India.

4414510,0,t1_csls9m4,Ok so Minus the rage from before I think I found a little tweak to your strategy. You can choose to take it or leave it... Taking Korchin is an awesome start if you can do it but alas often you cant because the AI in this new patch is very aggressive and if you are in another war Haixi is soon to declare on you. What I did to get around this was instead go for Haixi first. Usually they will declare on me but if not I will declare on them. Yes I take out a big loan to get an army that I know will win but it is worth it. Ive noticed in games where Ive gone for Haixi first I am a lot more successful. Also when you try to declare on Korchin often Oirat wont join in right away and you will have to be at peace to gain trust for a while which usually wont happen. So there is my little fix on your strategy. Take it or leave it but still overall you have helped me a lot.Edit It does take a lot of restarts to get Haixi to not ally Korea but It is definitely worth going for them first in my book. I finally got another successful start but Korea did expand a bit due to me weakening Jangzhou.,eu4,csn90e1,1,t5_2uqat

4421747,0,t1_csnzh2w,I think I did the secondtolast referendum and made everyone my vassals around  or so maybe a bit earlier. My pitfall delays were primarily wasting  IA per action whenever I told someone to change religion which may or may not be mathematically costeffective I honestly dont know if it is or isnt and getting stuck in stupid wars because you cant do a referendum while youre at war. A lot of the stupid wars were ally joinder wars often over Mediteranean or Ottomonrelated bullshit that did not concern me. What I should have done is declared separate peace after a year or two of the war which would not have cost me any real diplomatic damage with my ally. Instead I would always wait for them to declare peace themselves.One thing I will say I did absolutely right was play the ally game well. I maintained Hungary as my bitch for  years. If I declared war on someone Hungary would be there for me. War on Burgundy? Hungary would do the majority of the fighting. War on Mecklenburg? Hungary is coming to the rescue. I maintained my manpower and let my allies charge on ahead whenever possible which saved me assloads of money let me develop my economy and monarchy points and kept my allies just weak enough in manpower and money that they rarely could prosecute belligerent wars themselves.One of the best things I did with my allies was involve them in wars I didnt even really care about winning just to force a particular ally to fight a common enemy on MY terms with a treaty on MY terms. For example I almost always managed to trick France into destroying Burgundy for me  like France would just absolutely pick Burgundy apart multiple times. And what was the result? I get all the southern Burgundy territories and Burgundy unleashes its vassals. What does France get in return for capturing the northern provinces for Burgundy? NOTHING. Not even French cores. And? A year treaty! Suck on that France. You thought you were going to declare a conquest cassus belli on Burgundy in ?

4434444,0,t1_cspms49,No they cant inherit Burgundy directly but CastileSpain are potential targets of the Burgundian Inheritance event.The odds of them getting picked are fairly low however as they are literally the last nation checked by the event code. To see it happen you basically need a weakdismembered Austria has to have less than  provinces IIRC or a weak random HRE has to have less than  provinces? Burgundy must have no RMs with any nearby nations that have more than  provinces or theyll get first pick etc.This is often why youll see screenshots of Savoy or Milan getting the inheritance if Austria is too weak or if the AI picks the refuse button. Theyre medium size neighboring nations that tend to RM Burgundy. The odds that no one else of middling size will RM Burgundy are fairly low so CastileSpain almost never gets picked by the event.There is I believe an exploit involving allying France and declaring war on Austria to force it to spit out Styria and get yourself elected HRE before declaring war on Burgundy and completely occupying it which might still work with Castile.

Nobody really cares about conquest through OttosMamluks so you can steamroll pretty hard without ever building up aggressive expansionism or causing coalition wars. Admin Religious Quality and Influence ideas really helped me out. Religious should be pretty obvious as to why. Admin because you get an utterly insane amount of free claims on land as BYZ through missionsevents literally the entirety of the mediterranean so lots of coring is likely to happen. Influence to help balance the conquest mana pools. Quality because manpower really wont be a problem and stacking that discipline as the purple pj army will wreck people in a way that makes Prussia look like natives.If youre going Merchant Republic route you probably want to keep Athens as a vassal to eat up Ottomans land  theyre going to be repeatedly attacking you if you stay small so youll have to deal with them eventually.

The best part is that should you secure Skane Stockholm and Sjaelland you are essentially rendered invincible to coalition wars. Alternatively go hard on TO then secure Muscovy alliance ASAP to protect against PLC. Austria  Muscovy should be enough to defend vs. PLC and if youre creative enough you can trap the entire Polish army on Osel. Requires Bohemia not to rival you but the instantPU on Bohemia strategy via abusing their interregnum is still doable I think.,eu4,ct52g0q,2,t5_2uqat

GB declared x while westernizing and ran me over and demanded half my provinces.This try was easier but I got the christian conversion event immediately after beginning to westernize so I had to westernize with  legitimacy and  religious unity which was not fun. Spain also attacked during the middle of it and then the Iroquois jumped in too. I was able to peace out with Spain for only one province and all my gold which meant I had to go seriously in debt. With no manpower and rebels everywhere I also had to give the Iroquois three provinces. I was able to recover but the rebels were still a significant problem. After Westernization was finished I was able to recover attack some small tribes on the west coast for gold annexed the Iroquois and ally Spain to help against G.B. and Netherlands to get the last of the provinces I needed.Ive also noticed that the A.I. values specific provinces a whole lot. Especially the trade nodes. In my first game G.B. attacked me both times when I tried to colonize eastern Massachusetts. I didnt realize that was the trigger the first time.

I dont understand. To me trade is easily the most unfun and why why why part of the game. I understand how it works. I understand SOME of its historical significancy. I just think its not ENOUGH for such a game. I think trade should be part of the diplomacy not just some nodes that you can control by blobbing all the nations.

Also was strong in Caribbean and Aden.Taking Trade ideas when I did instead of Influence may have been one of the toughest decisions of the game but I realized that if I couldnt pay to sustain the advisors and military to stay ahead of the power curve having the ability to hold territories a bit easier wouldnt matter. Once I took Trade never had to worry about money again kept all buildings in all territories fully upgraded spent many thousands playing advisor roulette to get the indispensible  BROT and  Discipline advisors.

Being a large catholic nation with good dip rep when the reformation hits is a good way to do it. I became the emperor once as great Britain without even trying.  Basically if Austria loses emperor status the other states become easy to deal with or heretics in terms of competition. Keeping relations high and mitigating negative relations with better relations over time if its severe enough will do the trick. It is harder if the reformation has a limited impact. I was able in both cases of fixing the Religion problem in the HRE within  years. However I was fighting multiple wars at the same time.

4865122,0,t3_3hizpb,About a week ago I saw a post about how ridiculous The Papal State can get early game so I decided to give playing them a shot. I played very very quickly. Had I been more careful this might have turned into a WC.My opening move was  as the previous thread suggested  allying Austria fabricating on Venezia and having two wars with Venice for all of its territory. From there I allied one of the Italian states Ferrara IIRC picked a few fights with Naples and bided my time until the s when the Italian states leave the HRE. Immediately I attacked Genoa and took its territory. At this point I allied Burgundy and Hungary keeping Austria as well and then focussed on securing as many cores in the Genoan and Venezian trade nodes as possible. This meant picking fights with France who Id been beating up with Burgundy and Spain. Meanwhile any time the Ottomans threatened Hungary Id join with Austria in fighting them off.After securing territory in southern Iberia I dissolved my Austrian alliance and cleaved it in two  and proceeded to spend a century breaking the HRE eventually dismantling it. First time Ive done this in a game! During this time I continued to help Burgundy eat the rest of France and Leon emerged to carve out the rebellious remainder of the Iberian peninsula. Invincible at this point I took the holy lands and Constantinople and sent a k stack to America for Independence Day celebrations. In the last  years of the game I easily stormed across North America. Perhaps with an additional  years of game time I could have secured all of the land in the Americas. ,eu4,cu7sb2k,3,t5_2uqat

4950683,0,t1_cui00b9,As a general tip try to always take the option that gives monarch points or doesnt lower them from events unless its something really brutal. More often than not the value from admdipmil points will be greater that ducats or whatever other options are.You want to avoid harsh treatments as much as possible basically only use it when absolutely needed. When you have unrest go to the diplo window and mouse over the rebel type that is brewing trouble  it will tell you what specific provinces have what  of unrest. Putting army troops in those provinces can reduce unrest quite a bit even removing it altogether in some cases. A decent sized army will lower unrest by  in a province. If you have  provinces with  unrest and are at peace splitting units around each of them can completely shut it down.The only mana you really want to dump is adm to remain at  or more stability and dip for lowering war exhaustion while actually at war best to just let it tick off when at peace directly after a war generally.Quick edit If youre playing a country thats likely to expand fast or bordering on different religiouscultural groups its generally advised to make the humanist idea group one of your first choices as the unrest and tolerance bonuses are really nice for keeping rebellions to a minimum.This is also why many people default to setting their national focus on admin so they can usually have enough reserve to keep stability positive in the event of a comet.,eu4,cuikmya,1,t5_2uqat

5302509,0,t3_3nmflw,Its possible to not give them up.If you can ally an Austria that is hostile against Burgundy you can posture in such a way that Burgundy is a juicier target than you to France. Wait until France declares war on Burgundy and then swoop in and take the  provinces that are Flanders Picardie and Artios do it in two wars. The French like to break Burgundys unions in their first victory so this will stop the Austrians hating you because you suddenly become neighbours if the event didnt fire already. With these you command the overwhelming majority of the English Channel trade. Avoid taking provinces in the HRE because this is asking for trouble.The second major problem you have is the War of the Roses. You need to take options that will allow it to fire quickly or avert it completely. I personally like to try and have it fire quickly because your original King is  and by picking sides you can pick a great King usually s across the board. This can allow you to rocket ahead with respect to military tech ideas and culture conversions...If you culture convert Normandy Caux Gascogne and Labourd to English then you cant lose the cores which will make them a pain for France to hold if it gets its grubby mitts on them. It also makes them more profitable for you long term if you hold them. If you do take Flanders then you might consider doing the same for those provinces because it will stop the Dutch separatists from popping up when they do and if you decide to go protestant will make the conversion easier.The Scots have a habit of allying with one or more of the Irish minors. Connaught is the one to vassalize diplomatically early and then go to war with the other Irish minors. One of them will call in Scotland separate peace Scotland out with it annulling all treaties give the rest of Ireland to Connaught. A second war with Scotland will see them become your vassals and the event will eventually become available that will automatically integrate them and form Great Britain.My biggest problem when playing England is lack of manpower and lack of Army tradition. If you take Defensive ideas you can pick up the  morale and the . Army tradition. Along with the event The Last Jousting Tournement . Army tradition and having all your forts active . Army tradition youll hover in the s with AT and this will allow for some Frenchlevel generals after the one you start with dies. With the morale boost as well you can be fielding an army better than theirs.For manpower With the English Channel trade firmly under your control and higher tax revenues from the continent you can afford to field good amounts of cavalry and cannons supported by a continuous stream of mercenary infantry to offset your losses in battles. Were talking two stacks of  infantry  cavalry and  cannons each with their own good general. The French like to keep half of their army sitting in Paris meaning you can pounce on them with  thousand troops and deal a quick first victory before they have a chance to coordinate with themselves or worse their allies. Stack your  cannons together and siege a fort quickly. Leave the other  thousand men somewhere juicy hills woods mountains over a river and Frances second stack or their allies will march over and be met with your full force again leading to another defeat. By the time the Austrians show up Frances allies will have as well and theyll split their forces between a siege in Aquitaine the Austrians in the French Alps fighting back to Paris and if the Portuguese join fighting in Iberia.The key to this plan is to try and obtain a swift victory. If you fail to break the French and Spanish for me as they were allied fast enough then they will eventually win. If you feel the war shift in their favour peace out for whatever you can even nothing because its better than losing. Then keep going to war with them in a similar fashion when the truce is up.Without Normandy Aquitaine Flanders or Burgundy France will quickly find itself surrounded by neighbours of increasing strength and increasing ferocity and at an economic and militaristic disadvantage. The Italian states will get her involved there Venice or Hungary might get her involved against the Ottomans. The Iberians will get her involved in North Africa. And any move eastwards will cripple her diplomatically and see her up against the Austrians with you as their ally.By  even if you have taken no provinces from France as long as you hold your provinces and Brittany and Provence havent disappeared completely you have won.,eu4,cvpgh42,5,t5_2uqat

5449969,0,t3_3pmbbu,gt is poland into prussia still doable in . ?Yep you can still do it! Here is my . Poland Strategy  Ally and RM Austria and Bohemia. Improve relations while waiting for the Lithuania Union. Ally Brandenburg but do not RM. Dont ally Brandenburg until youre about to DoW The TO or Brandenburg may pull you into one of their wars before then.  Attack The TOLORiga Alliance and mark The LO as a cobelligerent. Let your allies do all the work.  Annex Riga. Vassalize The LO. If The LO hasnt FCd on Novgorod then youll have to annex Narva FC on Novgorod yourself then sell Narva back to The LO. Alternatively you can feed half of The LO to Lithuania annex Estonia FC on Novgorod then release Estonia as a vassal. Feed all TO provinces to Mazovia.  Attack Novgorod. Call to Arms Brandenburg. They will decline break the alliance and save you a diplomatic spot. Novgorod will be extremely weak because they will already have been attacked by Muscovy. You can do this by yourself. Feed all provinces to The LO.  Start the Diploannexing Mazovia and The LO.  When the diploannexing is almost finished sell provinces to Lithuania so you are small enough to join the HRE. Liberty Desire will start increasing but the diploannexing should finish before it grows beyond .  Release Novgorod as a vassal and attack Muscovy after or during their war with Kazan. Bohemia should help you. Split the  warscore between Novgorod and Lithuania to avoid Overextension Rebels.  Sell enough Polish provinces to Lithuania so you can Culture Shift to Prussian.  Diploannex Novgorod.  Opportunistically attack the Golden Horde and Hungary. Lithuania should FC on the GH for you. Austria often will help which will allow you to attack their ally Hungary. Feed provinces to Lithuania and annul their alliance with Austria. However if Hungary is allied to FranceEngland for example you can just let Austria have Hungary.  Continue to expand into Muscovy and the Hordes using the same style of alternating the feeding of Lithuania and feeding your vassals then diploannexing your vassals.  Become HRE Emperor by vassalizing  Electors. Brandenburg and Saxony are the easiest to vassalize because they share a border. The other  will often be by chance. For example Bohemia CTAs you against their war vs The Palatinate. Vassalize The Palatinate and use their FC on Mainz to vassalize Mainz.  Add all provinces to the HRE for IA  pass  reforms.  Form the Commonwealth. Doing this automatically removes all provinces from the HRE but you remain HRE Emperor.  Readd all provinces to the HRE for IA  pass  reforms.  Youve now Revoked the Privilegia Austria should have passed  reforms before you took over as Emperor.  Convert to Protestant and Form Prussia. Doing this automatically removes all provinces from the HRE but you remain HRE Emperor.  Readd all provinces to the HRE for IA  pass the final reform at your leisure. Forming the Holy Roman Empire should remove the Sejm from your government or you can just keep Sejm and the vassal swarm. Do whatever you think is fun. Hope this helps! So far Ive done guides by request for the Timurids Poland Golden Horde Poland to HRE Mamluks Delhi Vijayanagar Ethiopia The Ottomans Muscovy Lithuania Venice Hungary to HRE Uzbek Aragon to HRE QQQara Qoyunlu and now The Golden Horde Hope this helps!,eu4,cw8ab0p,3,t5_2uqat

Fed Moldavia a bunch before eating them so I could fabricate claims.  Im thinking I might take Religious as an idea so I can just Holy War.Italy was bizarre.    As Florence allied France and Austria early on warred to get all cores needed for Italy got all but Genoa who was loved by everyone.  My allies included.  So I started colonizing and taking bits of land here and there until finally Genoa and I were on opposite sides of a war and I peaced out as soon as I got that province we were both cob so it was all I could afford.  By that time I was Tuscany with max national ideas which turned into Italy with max ideas and that lovely admin core creation reduction plus that lovely Italian core creation reduction meant that I mostly left Europe aloneI vassalfed Albania and ate the Greek provinces myself vassalfed Leon diploannexed them diploannexed Munster GB is too damn annoying to take over unless you really really want to invest the time into it at the last moment diploannexed Finland appeared too late to add territory.  Colonized a lot and took lots of colonies.  But I feasted on the Turks.  Austria became about  of the HRE and expanded into the Balkans calling a holy war that they didnt invite me to even though we were usually between  opinionwhich was probably smart of the AI given that I would have taken most of it myself had I called the war.  At the close of the s the alliances were IIRCItaly Austria  Poland  Lithuania  GenoaAustria France  Poland  HRE states  GenoaPoland Lithuania  Austria  Italy  FranceLithuania Poland  Italy  Someone else I cant remember but really everyone loved Lithuania in this game.  They only ever really warred with Crimea Muscovy and the Ottomans.France Austria  Poland  GenoaSo basically if one of the five big powers wanted to jump another one the other two would intervene.  I think GB and Muscovy were allies at the end but neither were really interested in Western Europe.I also took Denmark and Norway because why not.  Poland took Sweden.  I think Scandinavia was released near the end as an OPM.  Spain was reduced to one province in Europe and moved their capital to the Spice Islands IIRC.  Portugal would have been kicked out of Europe entirely if I had a few more decades.The Commonwealth also currently holds Norway sans Sjelland.  I like owning Denmark.

If Polands Interregnum ends while at war they dont get their PU with Lithuania preventing them from becoming Godly powerful.  You can also often vassalize Mecklenburg in this war.

On the upside the AI seems to always answer  defensive calls to war now.  If you can get Bohemia as an ally go for it but dont count on it.Personally I like to drag Poland in to a war with the TO every time our truce ends.  If nothing else just humiliate for the monarch points.  A Poland that never managed to take Danzig because youre keeping them in constant truce with Poland and doesnt have Lithuania is much more managable.

It doesnt matter how strong your troops are if they can just be drowned out in blood.  You get more bodies from quantity and from having more land.  And of course from certain NIs like ottomans and Muscovy.France has good ideas but not great.  Prussia is alright.  I generally prefer TO ideas to Prussian since missionary strength is rated higher for me.Ottoman tolerance is nice personally think its weaker than just straight up conversion strength.I believe I stated in my post this is just in my opinion.

5815572,0,t1_cxhv5t0,I didnt mean to say that they should not improve the final screen. In fact the first time I saw this screen I thought something along the lines of what is there no way to see how large my army is compared to other ones?. Wouldnt hurt to at least put some more informationshortcuts to ledger etc. into this screen.At the same time after having played for a long time I also started ignoring this screen and the final ledger since it didnt feel important... most games are stopped at a point where I am better than anyone else so no need to see these things repeated in another screen. Often there are not even major throwbacks in a run since many players simply restart as soon as they lose a major war so even a line graph over time would be pretty boring. I guess many players feel similar so I doubt that it is high on paradoxes feature list. However I would really like to have a native ingame replay savegame feature just to e.g. watch a particularly interesting run while eating lunch Reworking score is an option but then again which metric would you use? Appreciating numbers myself  I often thought about alternatives to the useless system we currently have none of them really felt satisfying or better than watching individual statistics in the ledger at the end of the game. Its also not clear how to deal with more difficult countries i.e. how to reflect this in score... should you get more points because you started as a subject and not as almighty Ottomans? If so why should a start as OP Sweden starting as a subject award more points than starting as independent OPM Ulm? Trying to figure this out according to provinces also hardly works... and also the position of a country is important. All in all I doubt there actually is a way to compare different runs with a single number.Btw personally I dont think current score is too difficult to understand. You have it in the upper right corner and get a tooltip that tells you how much it increases per month and that it increases because of ranking in adm dip and mil. Once you figured out that there is an individual ranking for these three in the ledger you are good to go. Although I must admit that the end screen with historical scores is rather confusing... since it does not relate to any of the scores in the your run. If you have any questions about the current score feel free to ask.,eu4,cxhz58j,1,t5_2uqat

Until then though as long as you are emperor you are stuck as Catholic. There are basically two paths open to you now you can use your emperor status to try and pass the reforms of the HRE or you can abuse your status to cannibalize as much of the HRE as possible while you cant have unlawful territory demanded from you. Both paths are fine but its probably too late in  to really get going on the reforms so I would recommend the latter path especially if you want to go Protestant.,eu4,cxspcgj,1,t5_2uqat

No.  I think I may have gone into why production is the best money source in the game in one of my videos but I know DDRJake generally still talks out his actions every time.  I personally learned the game off of DDR jakes last TTM run.  That said a decent amount of those mechanics have changed since then.  The game has been changing quite a bit after every major patch for the past year or so so new mechanics or changes to mechanics still get discussed about a decent amount Id imagine.That said I do have to warn that I dont want Arumba or Shen that often at this point.  Arumba got too whiny for me especially when it came to him not understanding a mechanic.  Shen just does not have the personality of a streamer that I enjoy watching.  That said I do enjoy Arumbas ck videos.

I believe the alliance had some k troops vs. my k higher Moral and better Generals. I had just westernised and caught up in Mil tech.I conquered all of Russia and built four lines of forts in their winter and arctic provinces from Moscow to the Ural. When I declared war I let the Commonwealth march into my provinces and bled their manpower for some ten years. During this I engaged isolated stacks with mostly merc armies to break up sieges but lost pretty much every battles due to their superior troops and generals. In the end despite sitting at some  warscore losing most battles for ten years and being down to my last line of forts I managed to peace out their allies and start winning against their manpowerless armies. Even at the turning point I had some k manpower left and around half my treasury which started at k.

I had to speed  and listen to some podcasts check out the rAskHistorians podcast its really good while colonies finished and truces ended.The  points you have to spend for western tech are a pain but  is more than enough to buy the greatest government form in the game Dutch Republic. No stab hit on ruler death? Fuck yeah! Need to focus on the land? Go Orange! Need to rule the seas? Statists for you! There is no way to describe how awesome this form is. The events are pretty cool as well. With  points left and some syphoned from my ruler I didnt have much choice ideaswise the only things I changed are additional Discipline always good and a puny but useful  settler increase.I am torn on the Norse religion. On one hand the god bonuses are pretty useful specially Tyr and Odin with a Republic you get to change them every  years which makes them very flexible. On the other pretty much all colonists are catholics and not only will they hate your guts as a pagan but the land you conquer from them will drop your religious unity and raise unrest. Overall the deciding factor was the mental picture of Europeans landing in America and finding a bunch of tanned vikings ruling over the aztecs. It was really fun RPwise.Ill admit the Castillian culture does not fit well with the whole viking thing but you will be conquering from the Iberians most of the time and once you become Empire rank you will have a cultural union over all Iberian cultures.There were a couple surprises in Europe Austria got an early PU over England which stopped them from colonizing and gave me one less competitor in America. The Iberian wedding did not fire and Aragon became a colonizer as well. The first European power I allied was France but it was short lived for they went on a moronic conquest of corsica which turned all of the HRE and the Iberians against them. After that I rivaled them and allied with glorious Austria my most faithful ally during the game. Seriously the didnt even want one puny province from my enemies.Russia got BIG but did absolutely nothing for the rest of the game. Bahmanis formed Hindustan? and gave india a pretty white color.

5999868,0,t1_cy5z2ke,AND I think assaults should be totally reworked. No one assaults unless the garrison has under  men in this game and you can not see anything while assaulting other than moral dropping.There should be some type of combat window like in regular combat. First you should have the option of doing a full on assault which would be suicide or make volleys of cannon fire on the walls. If you choose cannon fire on walls you can weaken the walls at the cost of regular cannons to make the assault easier lose less men. Once you roughened the walls enough you should then commence the assault by clicking another button which should be like as it is right now except you should take less casualties and there should be a combat screen of some kind.So you have two options siege or assault with Sieges lowering development the longer it is and assaults being more costly of man power.

6017579,0,t3_3xw1yq,Interestingly I just started my Circassia game today. It has gone pretty good so far. Here are a few things I noticed.. Circassia is a restart nation. If the start is bad you cant win. Straight up. Crimea will always rival you and usually declare an early war. For a Circassia start to be playable there needs to be a large horde war to the north that draws attention away from you.. Trebizond and Theodoro Start improving relations with Theo and build  units unit cap. After a month or two you should be able to ally both of them. This will prevent an attack from Georgia from ruining you.. Shirvan and Gazik Claim and take Gazik then do the same to Shirvan. Pretty straight forward.. Georgia Georgia is easily defeated by juking them Not engaging in direct combat and just sieging. If your general is good enough you can beat them in direct combat. After the war goes for a bit QQ will declare on them and start sieging so dont expect to take all the provinces.. Muscovy If things have gone well enough you should be able to rival GH and get Muscovy as an ally.. The Hordes Depending on how long and brutal the horde war at the start was some of their land could be up for the taking. Crimea is usually the easiest target followed by GH. Let Muscovy do the fighting for you and do the sieging. . QQ Around  or so they should be pretty weak whether from Armenian rebellion or war with Otto Timmy or Mammy. Take the Armenian provinces and Arbadil access to the weak Taberistan.. Independence At this point you should be strong enough to go to war with your neighbors minus Otto without aid and conquer Theo and Treb.Other tips and tricks. If you arent good at estate management or dont own the Cossacks dont try to play Circassia. They are extremely difficult and you need all the help you can get.. On that note ride the Clergy and the Cossacks nuts. The clergy gives you the stability and conversion power to expand into Muslim lands and the Cossacks give you the power to do it.. Some of the minors you conquer are pretty rich. Be sure to milk all the gold out of them you can.And remember that this list isnt set in stone just how I succeeded and what I saw that worked. For my successful playthrough I actually started with war with Georgia,eu4,cy8fidu,3,t5_2uqat

6166067,0,t3_3zybxm,Pain suffering tears and a headache. Those were my   hours in the game. But on a more serious note. Pick up the game if you want to feel epic CIV never did this for me. Do the tutorial. It will introduce you to the interface basics. Then pick a strong read France Ottomans nation and start a game. Fiddle around a bit and see what happens. Something happened and you do not know why. Google it. Something else happened and you do not know what. Google it. And so on till you understand the basics of how the game works. Then get the Art of War expansion if you like the game. This will improve warfare by a mile. Then get the other expansion packs looking at own preference. I have all of them besides the newest one and the experience is great. I started as stated before then got Art of War Then Common Sense and after the rest. Its worth noting that EU is nothing like CIV. Its a lot more complex. Diplomatic relationships can be hard to manage in the begging but once you get the hang of it it will come like second nature. Also read up on warfare where to fight how to properly siege how do modifiers go into the battle.For more info read the wiki google and watch some Arumba videos on youtube.

6175687,0,t3_401mwl,Welcome to EU. A game that has already sucked up  of my life and that would probably place me on the noob rank here.Other people have already answered your questions better than I would. But some general tipsThere are many mechanics in the game they become more numerous and more in depth as you get expansions for the game but its best to learn the game with the base one. Once you get the expansions and play with those you dont want to go back.These many mechanics can help you to improve your nation and give you an advantage but remember that the best way to win will still be expanding your nation its also a bit of critique I have on the game but dont worry about that now. There are a few ways to do this  direct conquest and annexations which means taking administrative ideas is a very good idea. This method means you have to be careful of aggressive expansion penalties in your neighbours diplomatic penalties that cause AI to form coalitions against you Vassalization and diplomatic annexations. A bit more tricky but sometimes more rewarding vassalizing neighbouring nations and feeding them your conquests. You let your vassals process the provinces you conquered and eventually annex them via diplomatic means. This means taking influence ideas is a must to make this method worthwhile. Be careful that your vassal doesnt become TOO powerful.  Colonization which requires ideas like exploration and expansion is depending on which nation you are another option. Not going to go indepth about that. Theres a tutorial about it in the game AFAIK.If you want to play with a special case you can go for emperor as HRE best try Austria first. They give a unique experience in that regard.,eu4,cyrm1fy,1,t5_2uqat

However as soon as the ottomans decided its time to take your prussia down all other smaller states with sufficient AE will now take the ottoman army strength into account as well and will usually hop onto the bandwagon.

If you keep good relations with them prior to the Wedding and have a diplomat in hand you can support their independence right away. If you wait for a month Castille will support their loyalists and lower their liberty desire to . The same thing can happen but less reliably with the AustriaHungary PU.

In some ways it means buying protection you promise to send troops if Im attacked but I promise to send money if youre attacked. Given the AIs propensity to get into thousands of ducats worth of debt I think thats a reasonable idea.In my Genoa game by the s I got slightly bored and ridiculously rich while still being relatively small. France who was thankfully my ally could easily beat me the PLC and Scandinavia could too probably. At least the Ottomans got wrecked. What I mean is that I still needed to have defensive alliances but they pulled me into pointless wars that I didnt care about and had to do extra work to avoid losing troops. If there was a way to ask a country to guarantee me that would do nicely too but unfortunately there isnt.In that game I got so bored that I decided to pay off all the debts of nonhostile countries in the world.

Seriously k versus k and those bastards still win because they do absurd amounts of morale damage. Ive noticed that when a battle starts the Ottomans always seem to instantly bite th off of the enemies morale. I assume thats because of a national idea or somesuch.Funniest thing with this savegame. The Ottomans lost a lot of land leading Karaman to declare war on them. So even the AI thought they were beatable.

6597657,0,t3_4600wc,In my last game I went in order of Administrative  whilst unpopular to take an admin group first I think with Novgorod it makes sense. The first wars with Muscovy until you get Poland on side are going to be more about survival than conquest and the reduced mercenary costs are essential to combat Muscovys greater manpower. Plutocratic  Great all round idea group increasing army power economy and making mercs that bit more affordable. Trade  I would take this here as Novgorod doesnt have much need of other diplo groups. Theres not that many powers locally to allyimprove relations with and once Muscovy is gone you just need to keep Poland on side as long as you can until you form Russia. Trade help is brilliant and will send your income sky rocketing  also the extra range will allow you to start to pull trade from AstrakhanCrimea with ease. Expansion  A better choice than Exploration for Novgorod as the terra incognita should be falling back quite quickly by now and expansion gives a better balance of benefits to Russia.Theres a strong argument for Religious coming in somewhere in this first batch but that may be too admin heavy. However you are going to be encountering a lot of Muslim provinces so help with forced conversion may be deemed preferable to Expansion ideas and therefore mean taking Exploration ideas to colonise Siberia rather than Expansion.,eu4,d01r2j2,0,t5_2uqat

I think if you have a much stronger navy then you could try and blow up some boats and blockade some ports for war score and increased war exhaustion. With that I would feel much more comfortable with staying in a bit longer and waiting for Ottoman. But it still may not be my favorite option.The AI can be super unreliable or unreasonable in their peace deals. This can work against you if you stay in the war and Ottomans come super late. This can work for you if you peace out now and get as short a truce as possible. I think the best possible outcome is you peace out Muscovy and Sweden siege up Nogai. They cant get a huge war score because Ottomans are so big so they keep it up long enough for Ottomans to come help. They all get into a death spiral over some uninhabited scrublands. Muscovy and Sweden are  in ruins. Now your truce is up and Sweden wont honor a defensive call.Even if it does not go exactly like that I think the most important question is what do you expect to gain by staying in that war?  ,eu4,d03d6qj,1,t5_2uqat

6716336,0,t1_d0e0rnv,I didnt say it was farfetched I said you were cherry picking.  For the vast majority of nations this will either result in no change or even be a bonus as you can control which areas are overseas.  There are some corner cases where it is worse yes but you seem to be trying to find those cases instead of looking at the average one.  Id also point out this example is still better than the worst case in the current system.I also dont see how this is forcing the player to play a certain way.  The entire point of this system is that you can choose whatever regions you want as your core territory.  The current system is the one that forces you to play a certain way because the limitations are pretty much hardcoded.This does not seem like an antiblobbing mechanic to me whatsoever.  These territories are huge and anyone serious about blobbing will still be able to snowball rapidly.   It seems to me they are trying to fix the lame overseas mechanics in an elegant way that doesnt have too many major repercussions elsewhere and is engaging for the player. There are a lot of situations where this will be a boon to blobbing.  Take the BBB achievement as an example being able to core large parts of Europe as overseas will make that achievement much easier.,eu4,d0e0zrj,2,t5_2uqat

Army tradition as well since they were soldiers first and foremost with little interest in political or religious intrigue.Outside of military ideas legitimacy stability cost or national unrest might be appropriate the Varangians were besides being a crack infantry troop the Basileus personal bodyguards and since their fealty was at least in principle to the throne itself rather than to any individual a force for stability. Accepted culture threshold might work too the Varangians would use Norse and later English among each other and during the inauguration ceremony for the new Basileus would address him in their native tongue. Possibly reduced autonomy Basil II was very wary of letting individual nobles or generals get too much power and the Varangians helped him avoid that. You could conceive of it as the Varangians loyalty to the Basileus reducing the need to grant power to local nobles or whatever.Diplomacywise war exhaustion reduction is very Varangian. Galley combat or privateering would be fair there is no record of Varangians ever having command over a large number of ships but many of them were Vikings after all.,eu4,d0hmg0g,3,t5_2uqat

Level  would be outline.  Level  would include terrain.  Levels    would give you movement and attrition bonuses as well as combat bonuses.  .  The idea would be to give advantages to knowing the terrain.  Home territory would start at level  and you could improve it by paying to map it.  This would give defenders some more bonuses.  .

7029821,0,t3_4bx7vm,Reading up on strategies for this achievement I opted for the northern route.I allied Castille and Austria then immediately declared on England for my cores. Castille joined because I promised them territory on the English side Portugal and Tyrone helped. The English got repeatedly wiped out trying to land in Iberia. Fully occupying Portugal as well as the English mainland provinces allowed me to take all my cores in one war. Unfortunately that alone did not get me enough warscore to give Castille anything  but at that point I had dishonored their call to war against Aragon anyway so I didnt care too much.Next order of business was a No CB war against Scotland which ended swiftly in their full annexation.From there on I fabricated on Orkney then declared on Norway. This was the trickiest part  I had to fight Norway Sweden Denmark Holstein and Mecklenburg all by myself. I got some good defensive engagements in the mountainous Norwegian lands and managed to occupy a few provinces when Burgundy declared war on me.I kept fighting in Scandinavia until I could get the mere minimum I needed from the war just enough provinces so I could take Finnmark.Austria proved a big help fighting Burgundy until my armies could return to the homeland. Once they did we beat them back and occupied Burgundy fully. At this point I was of course hoping for the inheritance and decided to wait it out.So as not to waste time I had in the meantime fabricated a claim on Novgorod from my recently acquired province of Finnmark and thus declared on Novgorod taking their remaining provinces.From there on it was just fabricating and conquering anything and everything in the Russian region focusing of course on low development provinces. To help speed up the coring I moved my capital to Finnmark  this doesnt make coring faster per se but it removes the whole not in range to core problem that necessitates snakecoring. Of course to move the capital I had to be at peace so after  TWENTY years of war against Burgundy without getting the inheritance I peaced out. I bought down a lot of war exhaustion. A LOT. I somehow got the call for peace penalty reset when I made peace with Novgorod though so that helped.Austria dragged me into two more defensive wars which they handily won by themselves. I had allied PLC as well to help with Muscovy but that turned out to be unneeded as Muscovy had already lost at least one war prior to me arriving as was weakened already.,eu4,d1d6n75,16,t5_2uqat

Winning battles is the only thing that allows you to fight coalitions to a draw  its not like youre winning any siege races while outnumbered so best bet is to go for the .Incidentally Theodoro isnt especially hard.

Trade with caribean and the tangiers trade center will make you rich. Colonize south africa   the cape and then continue to colonize towards indonesia. Build a trade empire with lots of ships. Conquer land from natives using the religious ideas CB and conquer large landmasses. You can ally England but if england goes to war with france  just dishonor the call.

If you are both too weak to defeat them then your best bet is to simply concede the Western front and look East for expansion. Let Russia be a punching bad and hopefully soak up time and manpower and let them peace out by themselves so you dont have to deal with their warscore losses.

Once you defeat Spain just keep chaining wars together one after the other to try to prevent Muscovy from declaring upon you. With Muscovy on your side you should be able to defeat pretty much anyone east of you even if Muscovy wont leave their own lands you can just wait for the enemy to march their armies into Muscovite lands. Hopefully your Russian friends will do quite a lot of bleeding and will drop in LD as their troop count suffers. Just keep taking as much as land as you can and build up your military power to make yourself look as strong as possible. Dont fall behind Muscovy on dip tech to avoid that liberty desire malus for inferior tech. Obviously improve relations as much as you can as well. Good luck!EDIT Not sure if theres anything in particular you can do to prevent major powers from supporting independence apart from improving relations with as many countries as you can and trying to maintain friendly relations.

8048562,0,t3_4pg5wn,Hello and welcome to todays development diary for Europa Universalis IV. Its actually a well earned? day off for me but Im doing a once unthinkable thing and working a bit from home. Last week I said we would take a look at a very influential dynasty of the time period. Sorry to disappoint all the Velikopermsky and Dandani fans out there but I had the Osmanoglus on my mind.It would be an understatement to say that the Ottomans gave the world a good shaking in this time period. Furthermore they are one of the more commonly played nations in EUIV. We wanted to give them a little something to bring out their unique flavour since it was always a shame that they are a runofthemill Sultanate. It has also been pointed out on numerous occasions the oddity of a situation where you have the Ottoman nation..without an Osmanoglu at the helm.So to that end in the stillunnamed upcoming expansion we have added a unique government type for them The Ottoman Sultanate.The Ottoman Sultanate does not generate heirs like normal monarchies do. The ruler of the Ottoman Sultanate will have their own Harem to ensure the dynasty lives on. At the age of  your ruler will select one of his sons to be the heir to the throne. They will of course be of your dynastyeu.jpgSo an Ottoman Sultanate shall always be blessed by the strong line of Osmanoglus. That is to say unless the Sultan dies without an heir. In that case theyll still end up with an Osmanoglu. Blessed can be a relative term here.eu.jpgThere are a couple dozen events accompanying this unique government type to simulate the power struggle and intrigue of such a succession system and should add a couple of fangs to that already formidable Ottomans.While this is unique to the Ottomans any modders out there can easily allow this for other government types with the hasharem  yes line.I feel like were on a roll when it comes to governments and rulers so heres another thing for todays Development Diary. Abdication.Yes it has long been a requested feature in Europa Universalis. When Enrique or his lowstat kind just refuses to die you can abdicate and let your next in line take over. This requires you to have an ofage heir and to have either ruled for  years or be  years old. It will come with a considerable hit to your legitimacyunity and prestige but I think weve all had times where we wanted our monarch to Die Please Die.eu.jpg Ottoman Sultanate and Abdication are both paid features in the upcoming expansion which we have magically managed to keep unleaked namewise. Ive been mentioning a lot of paid features lately but its good to remind ourselves that with all the paid expansions come free bugfixes and features from the accompanying patch. A small change that will be coming up in . that I want to share is to do with succession wars. Im not to happy with how right now they have two conclusions Either the new overlord keeps their union or the nation fighting them over it take leadership over the union for themselves. Now we will add a peace option which simply breaks the union for all parties involved.eu.jpgSimple sensible and added free in . for those times where you just want to keep the status quo. Warscore cost scales with the junior partners size.For these with phonesHappy midsummer everyone Im off to....oh right I need to tease upcoming Diaries. Hrmm Well weve touched a lot on rulers but would you believe it were not quite done with the changes in the throne room. Well come to that in the future.

8277449,0,t3_4sq9ac,Yes hoi is made by the same company paradox development studio owned by paradox interactive. They make multiple other real time strategy games that are similar to hoi Ill go through them all for you.Crusader Kings     with all dlcs quick note here is that all of the games here except for hoi run by days not hours like in hoi in this one you actually play as a person where you try to expand your titles basically what land you own and dynasty. Its probably the most different compared to the other PDS games. It goes very in depth with all the different titles and things you can do. The way you expand and do things in the game is very different. Definitely not as war based as hoi. Basically a medieval ruler simulator.  lt Horrible explanationEuropa Universalis     Renaissance and colonization eras In eu you play as a country like in hoi. War with other countries to expand yours build up alliances and subject nations basically puppets manage your country and economy and basically have fun also lots of achievements. There are tons of different mechanics to learn and play with like colonizing and trade way more then I could ever explain here. If you take the time to get into it youll spend hundreds of hours. If the way Im explaining it sounds dull you just have to play it. You could spend eternity playing with all the different mechanics. Theres a ton of countries to choose from  of them you probably havent heard of. Whats nice is that every game you get a completely different outcome. One of the best things is to take a small country and bring it to greatness. This game is pretty difficult and can be heartless. But over its amazing fun I just recommend you watch some YouTube series on it and youll see the appeal. Mechanics are still very different from Hoi but after putting some time into it youll get the point. Its my personal favorite and I highly recommend it. For dlc I recommend you get art of war first. Its the best one and makes the game x better. If you want get common sense and Cossacks as well. All of them are great and if you go to a website called ga you may have heard of it you can get both the game and dlc cheap. Over all amazing game.Victoria     In vic you start as a country in the Victorian era hence the name. Not very experienced with this one but leaned more towards economics focus. Obviously you can still war and take land but also participate in the race for Africa and expand your empire. A lot of mechanics for imperialism like great powers and spheres of influence.

8481082,0,t3_4vso5d,So heres what I doI start as Brabant I prefer them for forming Netherlands. provinces more development better position. Just ally austriaenglandfrancewhoever rivals burgundy should be easy. I usually get my independence and get Hollandthe province. I recommend making a claim on Holland before the war. That should give you very good trade power in Channel. You can then move your portcapital there. If france rivals austria and you are allied with both choose Austria over france because of the unlawful territory debuff.Then just slowly expand in the low countries while improving relations with hostile countries. Its really straight forward its not difficult at all. Use austria to attack england for Kales and get some smaller alliances for annexing through low countries. I chose Savoy and Bohemia. Useful allies,eu4,d61ogdp,1,t5_2uqat
8488657,0,t3_4vz6c3,There are several strategies to end the war. The Blockade. Blockade them until their WE is high as well why didnt you do this before? eventually the AI will drop in how much warscore it wants to take allowing you to get out for just Calais and perhaps Navarra?.. Calais snipe. Land troops in Southern France as a distraction. Unsiege a couple of nonfort provinces so you can quickly disembark to avoid actual battles. When the French armies are all in the south land troops on Calais with a siege general to quickly take the fort. Once youve erased their  ticking warscore you might get out for war reps annul treatescancel vassalage with Navarra or by simply giving up Calais. You can destroy the fort there after unsieging it so France wont feel like they need to siege the province before they can demand it.. The long wait. Eventually CastileAragonBurgundyAustria will attack France or one of Frances allies. As long as you keep warscore above  youre fine. Under  youll take stability hits every time you reject a French peace offer if an England AI would have accepted it. When France gets tangled up in other wars unsiege Calais and get out with a white peace. Getting Defender of the Faith would help in mitigating the War Exhaustion.NOTE If strategies  or  are chosen The Blockade can and should be employed simultaneously.,eu4,d62mnpk,53,t5_2uqat

8512022,0,t1_d657a91,To piggyback on the previous post adding more non cannon troops does not help a seige. Early game when seiging send the min needed  so  for level one fort  for level  etc and use other troops to seige other forts or sit next door in a province you control nearby to help in a battle but no attrition. And yes always blockade ports of forts and if you have a general with skill in siege send him to lead the siege.In the end sieges take forever early game. Against an enemy like the greeks who cant hide wipe their army army then siege everything at once. For deeper enemies youll have to siege piecemeal. ,eu4,d65k68o,2,t5_2uqat

Once you integrate Naples you should be able to move your capital there and cultureshift so its possible to form Italy.  The big advantage is that not only is Aragon fairly strong or very strong depending on whether the Iberian Wedding fires they also have great control over the Mediterraneanwith a couple strategic wars primarily one or two to vassalize Genoa Aragon can have footholds across the civilized world from which she can expand allowing one to grow as necessary before taking on large opponents.   The biggest disadvantage and it is a significant one to forming Italy as Aragon is that Aragon begins with none of the provinces necessary to the formation of Italy so it can be hard to just grab the objective provinces without having to stomp through the whole peninsula.  Compare this to say Milan who can leverage its strong position with early vassalfeeding to accomplish the formation of Italy much earlier.  ,eu4,d6uw5kw,1,t5_2uqat

8894255,0,t3_523arx,There is a ton to this but heres a start. Early on you probably dont want more than a couple cavalry with the rest being infantry. This is not the case for some countries especially hordes but for most of Western Europe the cav just arent worth the cost to your economy. When cannons become available only build  to help in sieges. Around tech  is when cannons begin to become more valuable so at this time you should start putting more in your army. Take a look at the armies of your rivals to get an idea of how many cannons you want to counter at this time. You wont build more than your total infantry but you ideally want enough to fill combat width for your back line.Mercs are very valuable. The time to start building them is not at zero manpower but around  manpower. Zero manpower is too late. Reinforcement is so important as well. You want full  men units in all your battles. You have some options. Go back to your lands and reinforce this takes the most time or consolidate regiments and quickly build mercs to cover losses this is an instant fix. You can also press shiftconsolidate which will consolidate but create  men regiments which you can use to quickly hide in your own lands and wait for full reinforcement.Only use merc infantry as the cav and cannons are too expensive.Hit me up if you have different questions.,eu4,d7gynyp,9,t5_2uqat

You could also keep Byzantium as a vassal and integrate it  years later which would cost diplo and be  cheaper.Edit I looked at the decision youre talking about and I dont understand your question. No you cant convert to Orthodox and still use the decision to make Constantinople your capital but why do you want to?

8946312,0,t1_d7mc2a9,Im around  hrs into the game cant really say that i mastered everything since i think if you want to be successful you really have to get to know the setting events and the usual outcome of various wars in the first  years of game. I was thinking about playing Ottomans but right now they dont catch too much attention. There are too many Orthodox provinces to convert and enemies all over the place. If i fail with my current playthrough with Castile and Serbia i was thinking of playing Muscovy forming Russia etc. Conquering Novgorod seems like easy enough job and Sweden Lithuania and the Sunnis on the south pose a nice challenge after. As you can see i enjoy unleashing my inner Slav in this game and fighting the Sunni nations. But i really dont want to fight France right now. They are way stronger than all Iberian nations combined and more than that. Whenever i had war with them they would have an kstrong army that would steamroll anything that my coalition would muster up against it. I have learned how to keep good enough relations for them not to attack me. I do want to ally them as soon as i get powerful enough to rival Ottomans. But my goal really is just to keep Spanish territories under my control and colonize Americas as much as i can. I agree England is weak in the beginning of the game but they got me by surprise i guess and they still have a grand navy dont really know whats their naval limit but it sure surpasses mine. Nah my military tech is level  which is quite good i think its ahead of them actually but my general died days before they invaded. And they invaded quite fast. I really hadnt see that coming my eye was pointed towards the Americas. Thanks for the tip i learned not to waste adminmilitary points recklessly. That seems pretty interesting. But can Skenderbeg with k do wonders against a k strong Ottomans?  I destroy him just by leaving him attack Kosovo and then flanking him from two provinces. And Ottomans really flank and reinforce a lot. Hitting the Ottomans before they hit Military tech  seems pretty hard as getting to ally Austria takes a lot of time. I dont really know whether i angered them. They usually have a claim on Albania and once i take it most of the time they will claim most of my provinces pretty soon afterwards. Sometimes they dont but in most cases they do. What i figured is that finding stronger allies do delay their attack but it really depends. If they repel Mamluks and conquer whats rest of Byzantium they will most certainly turn to me and hate my guts by that time. However i do remember that they would do that relatively soon after i finish my conquest of SerbianBosnian provinces. Either that or Ragusa would declare because they have claim on some of those provinces dragging Ottomans into the war.Do you think that allying the rest of Orthodox countries on the Balkans Wallachia Bosnia Albania Byzantium Athens plus Hungary could work if we strike when if the Ottomans decide to hit Mamluks first?,eu4,d7n7qmi,1,t5_2uqat

Im not saying that Prussia was a military juggernaut they were but including Denmark as an example of that is like saying the British navy was excellent by mentioning how they burned the neutral Danish fleet at anchor because they were afraid the Danish would join Napoleon.Not only that Prussian military might arose after the War of Spanish Succession. Prior to that they were still only a duchy in the HRE. Only after that about  years ago did they become a great power and only after Napoleon did they really rise to be the most powerful military power in Europe  Years War doesnt count since the only reason Prussia survived the war is because the Russian tsarina died and her Germanophile nephew took over and switched sides.

You can claim territory through a peace treaty but you dont really own the province until you have integrated it. And you can integrate it but it may rebel later and return to its previous owner or become its own nation.Also in real history wars are much much harder to wage. Its not a matter of clicking a button and moving troops. There is immense coordination that has to happen behind the scenes in order to get an army raised and moved and keep them ready. The Ottomans were really good at that but even then theyd more often choose not to wage war than to go ahead and do it. The backtoback wars that EUIV encourages in good gameplay is simply impossible in real life.But on the other hand in real life you can take a lot more territory in a peace deal provided youre willing to keep enough troops around to integrate them. And what inevitably happens is you have to set up administrative districts that eventually go to war with each other. All it takes is one or more of your governors deciding that they dont need you anymore and theyre an independent nation.,eu4,d8ma49a,5,t5_2uqat
9232554,0,t3_56tnid,IRL they didnt hold nearly as much land as they do in game. They basically held the city of Constantinople not the surrounding countryside and the duchy of Athens was much smaller. Plus they didnt really hold Peloponesia it was controlled by another vassal the despotate of Morea. That being said because they didnt really hold that much land they werent nearly as annoying to the ottomans as they are in game. IRL the ottomans and Venice controlled all of the trade in the area so the siege of Constantinople was more symbolic than strategic.The other reason it took until  was that Mehmet was an extremely young ruler and there was a bit of hubbub surrounding his ascension administrative issuesangry nobles. Most christians assumed that such a young and inexperienced sultan wouldnt pose any threat to the dying byzantines so no Christian nation made any plans to defend them.When Mehmet finally attacked it was quick decisive and was over fairly quickly.,eu4,d8mal6u,5,t5_2uqat

9355555,0,t3_58mkse, I started with EnterElysium. By the time I was a full noob and him helped me understand the basics of the gameHRE and stuff. He explains a lot of stuff he does. He is a fairly good player. Not insane like youll see some people here saying but he does well everything he does. I learnt the game basically with this videos.He has an ok sense of humor. When I started to get better I moved to Arumba. I think he is more into GoodExcelent player. He tries to minmax everything which sometimes I find very boring to watch but he raelly covers the more proplayer mechanics. I never cared much about attrition before watching him. Armies composition as well trade mechanics. And etc...So my advice is when you feel good and confident with the basics of the game try to move to Arumba because youll learn almost every little detail of the game.I stikk watch him because Im satisfied with my kind of gameplay. I dont wanna become a master in the game which can make a WC in  years with a horde. No Id rather stay go with my pace and enjoy the game.I like his style of humor. Sometimes he seems to get mad with little things. Which I find funny. DDRJake is probably the best youtuber out there. He squeeze every little detail and exploits in the game. Which I dont find interesting to watch. Seriously. I know he can make insane kind of gameplays but I dont like seeing him exploiting things and playing on bugs and this kind of stuff. I know he has normal campaigns but overall I stick with Arumba.Worth mention Shenryyr is probably in the same level of Arumba. They both do gameplays together sometimes. Although he is way more immature than Arumba in terms of jokes and even map modes. It might be a good choice if you dont like Arumbas style. florryworry probably is in the same level of DDRJake. Knows and does insane kinds of exploits and bugs. Which again Im not really a fun of. He has a very unique style. So if you want a more crazy DDRJake he is the guy. marcoantonio In my opinion the best eu youtuber out there. Its like this guy was born to play this game. Its like he is years ahead of us in terms of experience. The BIG downside is that he is sooooo boring. Some videos he doesnt say a word at all. So Id suggest watch him only if you mastered everything you had to master in this game and really wanna think like a mastermind. Because his videos are not entertaining at all.,eu4,d91vu3x,3,t5_2uqat

9581781,0,t3_5c6hxd,Ive formed Italy as Savoy and Florence and the Kingdom of God with the Papal States.  Id say Savoy is the easiest.  You can ally France leaving you with plenty of time to gobble up Milan and the northern Italian states and cut off the peninsula from easy expansion.Both Florence and Savoy start out with great ideas youll make more money with Florence but expand slower  your neighborbeginning rival the Papal States had a habit of allying with either France Castile or Austria in my Florence games some of the cores needed get picked up by France or HRE states and by the time your usually in a position to fight Naples theyre in a PU with Castile or already Spain.  A republic offers great leader stats and the elections every  years mean you can really mitigate the popes excommunication and you get to form Tuscany at some point as well if you want.  Worth a try but like I said a little bit trickier than Savoy.Savoy you have easy targets in the HRE to start and Milan never gets good allies so you just have to be careful to avoid AE as you slowly grow until the Shadow Kingdoms fires and you can really go to town.  Your ideas are perfect for when you grow and rival France and Austria and they send twice your number of troops at you into your stacks and forts in the mountains good for the attrition.The biggest wildcard is Naples.  Papal States can be tough for anyone in Italy but there will always be a moment of weakness when you can strike and remove them as a threat permanatly.  If youre lucky they will gain independence and be easy pickings but most likely youre looking at a future war with CastileAragonSpain and their allies.,eu4,d9u5f1c,1,t5_2uqat

I also day  RMd Bohemia and forced a PU over them before  and spent most of my diplomats time improving relations with electors and powerful HRE members and warning anyone that might try to eat OPMs around my borders like BavariaBadenElsassPalatinate. Ill be honest though I started this on . and converted it to . in ish since it was such a lucky start and I did use the start date cheese so Venice and Provence were both princes before I started. The papal state was easy to deal with though and I reigned in Italy in  and in an early war against Kebab I took Athens and released Byzantium so I could later conquer their cores back and weaken them early. My advice is this RM Bohemia day  and Burgundy as soon as their first king dies whichever comes first and ally Poland Hungary and Castille force the PU on Bohemia and then RM your allies and you might get a Habsburg on the Spanish throne by event. Fabricate claims on the Papal State and take Ancona and Urbino in your first war Romagna too if your AE isnt too high and make sure that you break your alliance with Hungary when their heir turns  since you might have to fight them for the PU but you might get it for free like I did.

E.g. if you take your cores then you wont be able to get much warscore from completing the war objective or from occupying land unless you get across the strait which is pretty hard against Ottoman navy with the typical dumpster tier naval allies you normally get. ,eu4,day99at,2,t5_2uqat

9929448,0,t3_5horuy,Trade wise and Portugal relies on trade you should colonise important trade provinces. And I strongly believe this is the case for all the colonisers. Colonise up to  provinces in a region and let your newly formed nation do the rest. The new world is great but not as profitable as Asia. Go around Africa and start your trade companies. Also in your subject tab you can see the requirements for a bonus merchant. This will boost your trade even further. Loans are not terrible or bad as long as they serve a purpose. For example tacking loans to win a crucial war is recommended. Taking loans to make ends meet is terrible.Construction wise temples are usually your first buildings you can build. They give you a great head start economically however the big winners are manufactories in expansive trade goods.,eu4,db1tz5m,3,t5_2uqat

Having  people in one city and having  people around the city tending their farms are two completely different things  yet EU abstracts both into development and completely ignores the distribution of wealth. Cities often are home to traders business owners lords manufactories and other good things for your countrys economy and innovation.South America and Asia in general were far less urbanized than europe. Yes especially asia was far more populous but the population of China for example was far more scattered producing less wealth. This also caused difficulties in administration causing the administrative branches to become highly decentralized and corrupt. Add in the chinese belief that emperor has the mandate of heaven and you have a society that just cant develop like europe.

Conclave causes an intense amount of problems and if you DONT enjoy internal politics you should turn it off but... honestly playing without it now feels about as fair as playing with console commands.No offense to those whom dislike it of course...

So that the game starts as normal but these creatures begin coming in contact with Europeans and start beating the crap out of them. Like make these horses small with the ability to grow and make them militaristically superior but diplomatically navally and administratively inferior for a good chunk of the early game then have humans become superior to some of them at say gunpowder. To where the same amount of humans with guns can easily take down the same amount of savage orcs with no guns. But regardless you would need a horde of humans to kill a single dragon unit. So summary of rantOrc begin with units with high attack shock pips with high morale pips. With low defense shock and fire pops as well as low fire pips they also have lower discipline than humans. They fall behind humans quickly after gunpowder units are made. Low military organization.Elves Similar to humans with everything but with higher morale and discipline as well as lower tech cost. But have them have weaker unit pips.Dragons Very low force limit and manpower. Very expensive units. No access to ships ever. Units are VERY powerful with only infantry units and only one unit type which is far superior to humans even in end game. But have shit military organization. Blood Cultists Effectively humans but with a different religion centered around this. ,eu4,db8kgwd,2,t5_2uqat

10124318,0,t3_5kx0yw,Rule  I heard you guys liked looking at Iberian Bordergore... Edit Extra Gore several years Earlier Context The Reconquista was never finished and Granda managed to push into Castile with Tunis and Moroccan allies. Aragon took some land from Castile after. Then I Ottomans took Granda which let me gain a foothold in Iberia. Then I declared on a Portugal  Castile alliance took some land and released Galicia I had a large coalition so I wanted to weaken them. Kept expanding through Portugal northwards. Eventually cleaned up Castile somewhat I hadnt taken Cadiz although I had Sevilla then Galicia finished annexing Portugal. Aragon expanding into Castile reducing them to  provences. Aragon was forced to return Castiles cores in the  years war which made the weird snake pattern over Castile. Mali yes Mali of all nations forced Lon to become released from Castile. Lon got annexed by Castile which forced them to move their capital to Brazil. Then I took  Iberian provenances from Aragon and rewarded France for help by giving them  provences of Aragons. Then La Plata Castiles old CN forced Castile to return Lon Iberian cores which caused Lon to gain back their land with their capital still in Brazil. This is what you see in the Extra Gore section. Then I declared war on Castile and cleaned up the gore somewhat. At some point I also diplovassiled Galica They still liked me for releasing them even though it had been around  years. ,eu4,dbr7e49,3,t5_2uqat

The game did do exactly that. It caused enough problems that Paradox changed it in a postrelease patch to reload the data from scratch.There are three ways I can think of to solve this problem. Keep unaltered copy of data in memory. This has the obvious disadvantage of doubling memory usage.. Keep a record of changes made and undo them. The complexities in this should hopefully be obvious.. Clear the data and reload from disk. This has the same advantage as the first but has the disadvantage of slower load times.Both  and  are in my opinion the better solutions because they are simple. Which one you choose depends on how you favour memory usage vs. load time.,eu4,dbura43,2,t5_2uqat

10187380,0,t1_dbyqyy3,Hi! I had the vassal feeding question when I started playing a couple months ago. Im actually not sure if you can feed junior partners in a PU because Ive never done it before Ive only used vassals for this. Ill assume you can and just start from the point right after you win the war with Portugal. You can go to your subjects in the menu and click Grant Province to give them eligible provinces. They need to be able to core it so a nonadjacent inland province wont work. I believe they should be able to core the coastal provinces of Portugal. However I believe there are a couple centers of tradeestuaries in Portugal so youll want to keep those for yourself. If you want to conquer land in North Africa you should definitely vassal feed there because theres increased coring cost. You can either release a country during a peace treaty and then offer vassalization after or annex the land and release a vassal on your own diplomacy screen hit z when on your own screen. If the country is small enough you can forcevassalize but theyll hate you for a little bit.Let me know if anything isnt clear.,eu4,dbysnst,2,t5_2uqat

Every rival you force them to remove gives you  prestige and costs  warscore against that country. So if you can separate peace out a OPM and have them end  rivalries you get  prestige which costs no diplo points.

Poland and their vassal Moldavia form a wall between Austria and Lithuania. Poland went into debt in some war so they refused to help Lithuania. And because they like me they refused to give military access to Austria. So Austria was shipping their troops from the Adriatic to the Baltic in k stacks so that was manageable. I just beat Lithuania in a war and took a couple provinces and forced them to break their alliance with Austria. So now its going to be me and Poland against Lithuania and Denmark.

10363208,0,t1_dcip796,Land combat works different than naval combat. In land combat you get troop rotation between lines and reserves. In naval combat you dont. The ships at the back wait until the ships at the front sink or lose all their morale before taking their place. In land combat morale damage is distributed mostly to the unit actively taking damage and some of it is then distributed to everyone else. In naval combat every ship gets massive morale damage every time an allied ship sinks.So if you have all your heavies in one stack most of them will not fight. And if they do need to fight its likely that theyll start their fight with reduced morale. Which means you lose more easily and you have screenshots like the OPs.If you are fighting against a strong enemy navy its better to split up your heavies in small squadrons of  ships and engage accordingly so you can make maximum use of your ships.If you are fighting a weak enemy navy its better to have your whole fleet together so you can do instant kills.,eu4,dciqbxp,2,t5_2uqat

10429714,0,t1_dcq4gsb,I think there are dozens of threads about the best DLCs. Basically Art of War and Common Sense are the most important ones from game mechanics perspective as they add a lot of features making diplomacy and war more comfortable. You should grab them during a steam sale or alternatively on sites like kinguin for roughly  in total. Now since you like colonialization The Cossacks is also great as it allows you to set native policies so you can either colonialize faster or prevent native uprisings completely. This DLC is also recommended as third best expansion in general although it does change the alliance mechanics quite a bit as you need to accumulate favorstrust to call in allies into an offensive war unless you offer them land they desire  therefore making alliances much more defense focused at least at the start of the game and thus more difficult to expand aggressively as well as not being able to exploit the AI as an offensive ally as you may used to.The other DLCs do add small bits of contents each but as someone who owns all of them they are not that necessary especially since you are quite new to the game. A lot of them focus on specific regions New World for example or add special government mechanics for some nations Prussia Poland. You can get them in time if you really enjoy playing the game and some of the older ones cost like  during sales.,eu4,dcq9zhx,1,t5_2uqat

You certainly do need lots of generals when doing a world conquest but more for sieging down  Ottoman forts while also fighting another parallel war... Hence the reason why in my world conquests Ive never gotten close to reaching tech . With that and forced marches as the alternative option of spending monarch points going for tech  is just extremely unattractive.gtHeres the album. And please tell me the exact numbers youre failing with otherwise I wont be able to help you.Alright. I wont do a full number crunching but Ill say my overall thoughts on the run.Your vassal management seems incredibly loose. Youre obviously not scutaging them since otherwise you wouldn be able to create that crazy client state border gore. This means that theyre just ramping up their war exhaustion which the AI is extremely bad at buying down. This means that the client states have higher coring costs and very high global unrest. At the same time youre feeding them some insane amounts of land. K has almost the entire baltic a large chunk of Sweden and a bunch of HRE land including a large part of the Bohemian lands with their increased coring cost. K has almost all of Britain along with chunks of Italy Anatolia and France. K has half of Iberia as well as a bunch of Germany France and some of the Berber lands. I have gotten internal conflicts in vassals who were much less overfed in patches where the AI was better at buying down war exhaustion. It is also somewhat recommended to give client state same culture land so they can core faster and have less unrest. The icing on the cake for me are all these artificial islands you made for K in Iberia. Islands are the most annoying provinces to have rebels in so why did you go and get extra ones? In terms of rough monarch point math things also look super weird. When going for three mountains you are on a pretty tight budget Basically you should always try to spend all your diplo points at all times. As a comparison in my three mountains run run I actually had slightly better rulers than you did overall and I bare got there pointwise in the end. I didnt always do monarch point management perfectly but overall pretty well especially during the midlate game with very few slipups of hitting the monarch point cap. My progression of vassals annexed after  went like this  Madurai  Delhi  Jianzhou  K  Kazakh  K  K  K  K  K  K  K  K  K  K  KYours looks like this  Gujarat  Ajuraan? doesnt really look like a vassal but you have a state there?  K  K  K  K  K  K  K  K  KKAfter annexing Gujarat there is a long downtime of not using any bird mana with the exception of maybe Ajuraan which however is really small. Then in the late s you somehow manage to annex three massive vassals within  years while your ruler skill was two for twenty years during that period. And then after that there are only four mediumsmall vassals left for the final  years but somehow despite your ruler skill improving and abandoning Exploration ideas during that time you still end up with  diplo points and tech  in .,eu4,dd6q387,1,t5_2uqat

10696251,0,t1_ddj8bos,It is something new as of patch .. You can develop to get insitutions quicker. Every time you spend monarch points to develop a province you get some progress on an insitution even if you have no natural spread. So a common tactic to get them faster when it would otherwise take a long time to get to you is develop until it is present in a province. So if youre Sweden you could pick a province dump  total monarch points into its development and youll now have Colonialism present in that province. That might be enough for you to pay to embrace colonialism and remove the ticking tech penaltyor you may have to wait a few years for it to spread to other nearby provinces. The points spend developing will almost always be less than what youd lose to the huge tech penalty if you develop and embrace quickly enough.,eu4,ddj8log,1,t5_2uqat

In a short time these dudes will have their own religious turmoil to distract them.One thing you can do is rely on the power of forts in this age.  If you have forts in the mountains the enemy has to bunch up and take attrition.  Then you can attack them at  the fort and get defender bonuses.  With manpower and mercs you should be able t o punish them badly then look to darting over to Naples with a second army and carpet sieging them down for some war score.If you have given them some bloody noses but things still look grim you should be able to get a peace that only loses a little bit or no land....and then you strike to the East to get stronger and wait for this alliance to break up.,eu4,ddr6dub,1,t5_2uqat

It hasnt mattered much few less colonies than normal but you can soon capture more. I also aneexed portugal in  wars after I forced the last PU CastileAragonNaples this gave me all the Caribbean. The biggest issue for me is getting relations up afterwards it has to be positive for the PU not to break when your king dies. Timing helps here but that can be tricky with a CB thats about to expire.

10782857,0,t1_dds4du1,Sure! Restart until Lithuania rivals Muscovy and you can hire a statesman. Improve relations with Lithuania from day  and gain independence at your first opportunity might even be possible at start date. Lithuanias numbers should be enough to beat Muscovy and vassals. Keep their trust high in the peace deal youll need them to fight off hungry hordes. In my playthrough Kazan declared after the war with Muscovy. Lithuania joined the war and I took the core and a few extra provinces. The horde lands are generally worthless and since I couldnt convert them anyways dont plan to take religious ideas I just fed some land to vassals. I did annex and develop the goldmine though which has proven to be a daft move. Afterwards Novgorod attacked and Lithuania broke the alliance my trust with them wasnt high enough and they were allied to Novgorod but your starting ruler and heir as Perm are demigods so with the aid of awesome generals and an abundance of mana you can grind through the wars with relative ease. I took like  loans max but they were easily paid off through restructuring and improving the goldmine. After the initial war with Muscovy Novgorod and Kazan you should have grown strong enough to be able to match their strength. From thereon you can mop Muscovy and Novgorod up and plan your move into Scandinavia. Im about to launch an invasion saved enough favours with Lithuania to declare on Norway.,eu4,dds68tj,1,t5_2uqat
10787070,0,t1_dds7zvq,Im pretty sure I was declaring on Naples directly. Castile still had a PU with them and became the war leader but that wouldnt have anything to do with that emperor modifier right? I think it auto cobelligerented Castile so I could see a reason for this modifier if Castile maybe had been allied to an HRE member but their only ally was Portugal.The only other HRE members involved were Milan and Urbino who I also called in through favors and Ferrara who was my vassal. So it would have been Florence Milan Urbino Ferrara and Austria Emperor vs. Castile Aragon Naples and Portugal. And thats where I got the  Austria is the Holy Roman Emperor.Actually now that I think about it when I first tried to call in Austria against Naples I might have also been in the middle of  a separate war against some HRE member maybe Switzerland which one of my other allies dragged me into. So maybe you cant call in the emperor while youre also fighting against an HRE member in a separate war?,eu4,ddslwui,1,t5_2uqat

Also you are probably losing the K v. K because of the combat width the lack of morale and the Ottomans better troops and general. Dont send such a big stack into battle because most of your troops will not even be able to engage the enemy but they will still take morale damage every time a unit dies so by the time they engage they are completely depleted of morale. Instead send K in and then send stacks of K in again just to boost morale.I hope this helps you! If you have any other questions I would be happy to help.,eu4,ddstmsc,3,t5_2uqat

After you drop Trebizond which you should you should check to see if Poland rivaled the Ottomans. If they have then work on allying them asap. Dont panic if the Turks ally France or Muscovy or something. Allying Bohemia is actually ok. With PolandLithuania AustriaHungary Mamluks and Wallachia itll be easy. If you have Rights of Man be very careful calling in too many great powers as you certainly dont want a big HON HON HON coming over the horizon. Personally I would call in Austria and Wallachia only for the second war. Check allow allies to attach on your army so Wallachia sticks with you. Blockade the strait and let Austria kill Bohemia. They should do so easily then its smooth sailing as long as you maintain naval supremacy. Also make sure you and your allies are at least even in military tech with the Ottos and hire a discipline advisor.,eu4,dea3kv2,3,t5_2uqat

10975370,0,t3_5wpctu,You can send a missionary to a Shia province and accept demands which gives you  heretic tolerance modifier. Helps out a ton with Persian rebels. Also declare war on Tabarestan and take all of their money and force them to release Persia because most of the revolt events requires that Persia does not exist. Warn Persia afterwards. Thats basically the opener. If youre lucky getting a  unrest advisor would be ideal. Delete some useless forts and then get started on the Indians. Id say to disinherit your heir too since hes completely useless. Make sure to always be moving towards Egypt as well since youll have better access to institutions there because of high development. In terms of actual religion Id say either convert to Coptic or Hindu since those are actually better than Sunni. Use the dhimmi rebel trick. Thats really the best I can give you. Also you can eat Baluchistan whole and it would take around  development after razing. Dont tech up until you get feudalism. And thats it after that its all yours.EDIT also get some lands that have Iraqi cores and support rebels in QQ since supporting rebels gives your vassal no liberty desire when they defect. Try to move into Egypt as fast as possible to stop Ottoman expansion. The faster you move the better. Also you can ally Poland basically at the start of the game. Theyll be a great ally to deter the Ottomans. ,eu4,dec23ru,3,t5_2uqat

11151309,0,t1_desohg6,I played a game as Spain and I have a few suggestions to make your life easier all depends on your goal but in order to increase your power base heres what youll do.    Ally and diplovassalize Navarra ASAP is free land.   All the big nations can afford advisers from the start lvl  that is get them reduce army maintenance while at peace to assure you keep your income green.   Unless you plan to form the Roman Empire or they are already beaten to a pulp it is not worth fighting the french they start with really strong generals and their army becomes better later however if you see that Burgundy Austria and England are collapsing unto them join the party. But ally England? no never they are useless most of the times they will sit in their Isle while you fight the war on your own.   This has already been answered.   TBH this the royal marraige and PUs mechanics is so random that it is not worth trying to base your strategy around it unless you are going for WC maybe but if you want to play that game it is usually worth marrying any nation which has a really old ruller without an heir even if you dont get a PU or a succession war you spread your dynasty which in turn they might spread for you to nations they have a RM with. That being said make your focus getting the caribbean and the Ivory coast if you take out Portugal you will make even more money. Then move into Mexico by taking out the natvies and then colonize south America strat moving to south and east africa and take over Malacca then you will be rich. ,eu4,devzlu7,2,t5_2uqat

Should only take a few years at most for the war to start. Win the war and Albania should return all your cores. From there try to snipe as many of the Anatolian minors as possible and kill SerbiaBosnia if you can. Ally PolandAustria and from there just expand.

Then I run around with a bunch of  stacks with allow attachment on until they take the hint and join one. Then I run around with that as its own little mini army and never consolidate it with other regiments. I like vassals a lot because they give you a ton of manpower up front. A one province minor assuming you dont stack wipe them on the way in is going to give you k manpower assuming you never even fight with them. And they have a near limitless pool to reinforce given the size of their army. Then when you finally annex them they give you the manpower directly. So Its typical that every time I vassalize someone peacefully they give me k manpower. Thats a huge amount of men especially now mercs got basically doubled in price.

In the current version of the game it is necessary to  become a tributary  conquer everything north of Ming  conquer the eastern half of Korea including the CoT. This should give you gt development. The last step is  cancel tributary and attack Ming when you have tech  or  and they have a lower tech. By this their Northern Horde disaster begins ticking and you have an edge militarywise. You dont need to attack deep into their lands just make sure that you encounter their army only in the northern chinese farmlands and always fight with as many forces as possible.After that the game becomes incredibly easy because of their disaster.,eu4,dg5t6d8,1,t5_2uqat

People connecting with serbian or croatian name came way later. If you want to look at it from the point of noble families than it would be even worse that religion there is catholic because religion was a real difference in that time.If you want to go all the noble family way that area at that time was split between Kosae and Hrvatinii and those families had litle to do with serbian families.My sources are mostly from bs. and hr. wikis and my sources are saying diferently about first nobles and as far as etimology goes there were family names not ending with i Kosae some ilirian names minority in bosnia and the name of bosnia itself.,eu4,dgc7jye,2,t5_2uqat

11617345,0,t1_dgcpeco,gtthe sub agrees that navies are a waste of money...This has never made sense to me. Large navies are so incredibly useful and versatile! Heavies are just your regular  bruiser used to knock other navies over the head and i can see if people disregard them especially if their navies are purely for trade and rarely fight or only fight nations with weak or no navies. Pretty important if you live next to raiders to hunt pirates and the new devastation and prosperity mechanics means you HAVE to hunt pirates when near raiding nations. this role can also be done by galleys however since most raiders tend to be in the Mediterranean. Light ships are massively important if you want to get some serious trade income. They can also be useful in naval engagements when your far ahead in teach or have an enormous number of them. Galleys are pretty much just heavies lite in the Baltic and Mediterranean seas so depending on your location you can go with one or the other. Useless outside of inland seas IMO. Transports are pretty self explanatory. Now for something I never see people mention in this sub or if they do its to scoff at it. Blockades. Theyre so important during war time. They increase war exhaustion and unrest. Drive up warscore. Plus they give you half of the trade power in those provinces being blockaded. So for example if youre England fighting France and you cant brute force them but your navy is strong enough to keep them on the continent bam you just increased your trade power in the English channel for the duration of the war. In some cases Ive managed to make more money during war than at peace thanks to this. Plus blockades increase devastation another massive malus for a nation. ,eu4,dgcu4bn,35,t5_2uqat

But give byzantium at least  province so they become more useful allies and dont become a target for Venice. You can give mamluks something if they will take it the aim is to shrink ottoman while making those around it bigger. If youre in this neighbourhood you have to deal with the biggest bully.

The Age of Absolutism was a time when centralized monarchies like Austria France and Russia were on the rise and any states that failed to centralize like they did like the Holy Roman Empire or PolishLithuanian Commonwealth were falling apart.Absolutism doesnt really directly relate to conquering more territory.  What it does theoretically mean is that your ruler has more direct control over the government and by extension over the entire states resources which makes the state more efficient and stronger as a whole.Its an abstraction but I think it works okay.,eu4,dgf4ln1,8,t5_2uqat

11795111,0,t1_dgwzlpu,Pretty much it.  It is very common to take loans even several of them.  As long as you keep expanding quickly enough to keep ahead of the interest payments you will be fine.I am currently on a Castile run from . and I was frequently operating at the number of colonists I had available sometimes   or even  higher than that.  The cost of the colonies isnt that high until you start going over your colonist limit then things get pretty ridiculous pretty quickly.The main reason why exploration is so good is that you will have pretty much open access to the West coast of the Americas for quite some time as it will take hundreds of years for the colonial powers to get there.,eu4,dgx0kti,4,t5_2uqat

11802825,0,t3_68ehwa,The Indian sultanates are really annoying considering they always end up as one of the strongest great powers en par with nations like France and Ottomans. IMO it should be possible for it to happen but they certainly should be nerfed because as of now it happens literally every game. Theres a reason India was fairly easily conquered by Europeans. I mainly think this is a problem with development since sometimes its used to represent high historical population and sometimes its used to reflect wealth. So some rural Indian province is equal to Paris just because they have equal development,eu4,dgxw3ej,44,t5_2uqat
