700805,0,t1_cgjpjz9,This was sorta my thinking of why communitymade rules should expire after a certain time once the subreddit got large enough that way it wouldnt just be just hundreds of rules preventing you from participating.Another solution would be to have communities suggest rules in the master rule thread and the moderators pick and choose which rules get added and you can change them up from the suggested rules list once a week or once a month or so.That was also the idea of why usersubmitted text posts would have their own rules list so that people wouldnt feel discouraged by having to follow any master rules list! The large rules list would only be for a single large thread.Ive got an example of what I mean over in the CSS mockup I did in my testbed you can view it here ,calvinball,cgjxms8,1,t5_2qhfc
