When clan leadership begins a war search SuperCell attempts to find the most compatible match possible using its algorithm. However every three minutes that the search has not found a match it broadens its search one standard deviation from its geometric mean. Subsequently clans are encouraged to restart the war search every three minutes if a match is not found. If the search is not restarted the gravity of the mismatch begins to exponentially increase.,RedditCasuals,cpf9xpa,1,t5_31vhc
