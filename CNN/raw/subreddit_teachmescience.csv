Wed love your help.Thorns and shadowy shapes on windows that you could fear to be anything. Fear of fear itself. Fear of that nightmare corridor or whatever dream cliche that you cannot stop yourself from having every night. I dreamed the rabbit dream again. Why doesn t anyone ever run away in these? Here is AC s review.I may have to wait a while or perhaps never. Anyway I have to take my next scheduled medications. The review has worked me up. A Film Clings to Each Page I can t help but think of John Hawkes novel in filmic terms.I started the author s oeuvre here though he had published a number of other works prior to this one. The Lime Twig is still my favorite and represents a turning point in his style. I often tell people who are timid about reading the moderns and postmoderns that they should be encouraged by the Brobdingnagian portions of humor in the pages of Joyce Pynchon et al. We cannot avail ourselves of similar encouragement when it comes to Hawkes. These are stark unfunny pages.Coover has for the past decade been teaching experimental courses in hypertext and multimedia narrative at Brown University. His  essay on hypertext in the New York Times Book Review The End of Books galvanized electronic literature fans around the world. The Lime Twig is a novel by experimental American writer John Hawkes. This highly elliptical novel set. Sorry we just need to make sure you re not a robot..   ,teachmescience,cx9o3kv,1,t5_2xdfb
